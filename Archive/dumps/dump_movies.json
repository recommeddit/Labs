Tons of crackpot theories on that sub just like this one.\nThe Fargo TV show also drew me in for similar reasons.

    "text": "I just finished watching Person of Interest. Brilliant stuff. A slow start but once it gets into its stride it is unstoppable. There are several pointers in the show that shout out \"this is a jonathan Nolan show!\". An AI on the glitch asking \"Is this now?\" and being unable to determine if it is living a memory or not. The notion that some humans are bad code. And several times in the series the idea that as long as someone remembers you, you never truly die is presented. Plus some great use of music, Radiohead particularly and the Ramin Djawadi score is great.\nThe only thing I would warn you about this show is that the first season is very much a procedural case-of-the-week. And the procedural elements never truly go away for the entire 5 seasons. But the serial elements start to appear towards the end of S1 and then evolve into a web of cyber-punk, AI badassery gradually throughout the rest of the seasons. But at 23 episodes a season, it might feel like a long slog before it really grips you. \nIf I was to describe it in one sentence, i would say it is a cross between Christopher Nolan's batman (without the bat suit and fancy bat things), Westworld, the A-Team and War Games.",

    "text": "\"Legion\" was really excellent, though for me it is too different from Westworld to be comparable. I would say that where Legion is a creative graphic novel, Westworld is a more in-depth, literary series.\nOther than the truly life-changing Twin Peaks, (which others on this thread have already addressed), the show that most reminds me of Westworld is the original 1967 British TV series, \"The Prisoner.\" \nIn its 17 episodes there are several mind-blowing, highly-subversive subplots. But instead of \"cowboys & indians,\" it's \"spies & national security\" as the major theme. Replace Westworld's constant variations on the theme of \"consciousness\" with The Prisoner's ongoing exploration of \"free will,\" and there is a great deal in common. Both series feature slowly unfolding puzzles with surreal, humorous and horrific notes. Though there are significant differences, both series have numerous characters who are basically imprisoned in hi-tech theme parks, struggling with mind-wiping and programming. \nGeek culture has spent only half as much time on Westworld as on The Prisoner, which has been called \"the most over-analyzed TV series in the world.\"\nThe Prisoner was made in the 1960s and its mod fashion style and dramatic music reflects that time period, but in so many ways it is much more unique than that. Check it out (but avoid the horrible 2009 reboot)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner",

Maybe Lost like quality, but not WW quality.\nThe expanse:  It is sci-fi.  That is all.  No notable similarities.\nDexter:  I enjoyed it, but i don't see any similarities.\nHeroes:  Was pretty enjoyable even with anxiety heavy plots (lost like, not WW).  Some similarities of outcasts and powers with WW.  Ended left much to be desired and the squeal left more.  Not thought provoking.\nSense8:  A bit of a clunky/anxious and slow plot.  Some good quality point, some bad.  Personally very different feel from WW.  Enjoyed season 1 a lot, not really much else.\nTravelers:  I like it.  It had a smoother (most of the time) plot with less 'macro' anxiety than anything above (WW like).  Some serious (temporary) quality drops and slower.  Can be thought provoking (Note: very little on all of fiction TV itself could come remotely close to WW thought provoking depth, would call it relatively mild (probably)).",

And it\u2019s not exactly fair to dismiss a show just because it isn\u2019t on the exact same level as West World or Lost. Give Castle Rock its own props because it definitely has potential.

It's not sci-fi, but many of the themes that attract me to works like Westworld, Arrival, Ex Machina, Annihilation, and Star Trek are present. Origin stories, self vs. community, the link between victimhood and abuse, the struggle to work through/overcome inner darkness, perpetually shifting moral landscapes, the quest for emancipation, innocence and guilt, battling systemic Injustice (vs./while also) assuming responsibility for one's own healing and growth\u2014many good shows and movies touch on these themes, but great ones gently and articulately expose more and more depth and subtlety over time. The Wire was my first experience of that in a TV show. East of Eden was my first experience of it in a book. Anyway, I believe neglected trauma is the driving force behind many of our current socio-economic, political, and racial problems. That's why these stories are important. Westworld and Kidding both deal with the epic legacies of trauma, and I was reeling and in tears after both season one finales.",

I\u2019ve never been so emotionally and philosophically shaken.\nThat being said, I wasn\u2019t too happy with the ending, from the standpoint that I felt the best part of the show was how it left the mystery intentionally vague. When humans are faced with seemingly unanswerable questions, they inherently become superstitious/religious, which is what was so interesting about the show, seeing logical, modern people have their entire perspective on life completely ripped apart due to uncertainty. And I think by answering the question, even a piece of it, lays a sort of foundation of logic/understanding to the mystery, which in itself undermines the entire premise of the show. But yeah I guess they wanted to give the audience a little closure. \nAlso, sorry for making this sound very r/iamverysmart -esque, but I was trying to sound vague to not give away too much for people who haven\u2019t watched it. Plus it\u2019s hard to explain the emotional/philosophical plot of that show.",

    "text": "The problem with P5 (and other Persona games, from what I've been told - only really played P5) is that it's nigh-impossible to do everything first time around. In New Game+, you start with all your attributes as they were at the end of your first playthrough, so you can access certain confidant paths quicker than you did before. Plus you'll have a better understanding of the story progression; some confidant paths and side events don't progress further until after you've reached certain dates, and others become inaccessible if you leave them for too long, so if you're not aware of that you can waste a lot of time on stuff you can't progress and miss some stuff if you leave it too long.\nMy recommendation is have fun and do what you want on your first playthrough; don't stress too much about optimising your daily plans. If you decide you want to play through again, do it on New Game + so you'll have access to content locked behind attribute advancement faster, and know the story beats so you can plan your time better.",

    "text": "The Wire is very heady in politics, policing, poverty, education and journalism.  The Wire changed my perspective on these 5 topics.\nMost tv shows lose 'it' because they put popularity and ratings ahead of writing and plot.  \nThe first season of the Walking Dead was great but each season after they lose more originality. \nGoT in the 3 to 4 seasons but afterwards it plummets into a cliche popularity contest driven by the viewer expectations.  The books, A Song of Ice and Fire is much better put together but some others find the latter books a letdown.  \nBattlestar Galactica is very trippy and cerebral if you make it through all seasons.  It touches on similar themes of free will, predestination w Artificial intelligence. The downside is that at times the show lacks continuity and some episodes are stand alone and don't drive an arching plot.\nThe anime movie Perfect Blue is trippy and cerebral af. As is the anime series >Serial Experiments Lain   im not a big fan of anime either, most are shit like most of live action tv.\nI personally don't want a show that only wants to entertain me for an hour.  I want interconnection and continuity. If a show has more than 13 or so episodes per season its shit. The exception for me are 30 minute comedies such as the Office, Parks & recreation and 30 Rock. \nThe most cerebral stuff ivr encountered was in books such as A Scanner Darkly and the Dune series.\nEdited grammar",

Complex is a massive understatement with how the series challenges your attention.\nAttack on Titan is having its 4th and final season coming up, which should be its best season if it does the source material justice.

For example in episode two when he pores the liquid into the glass they put the coriolis effect in the way the liquid pored. This is HUGE because it is so fucking accurate for how that liquid would have pored in that situation in space. And there are plenty of other little things that you gotta be able to notice to really see how well done the show it.",
