I have just watched a movie of Darren Aronofsky Mother! and I had mixed feelings after watching it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7urapp/mother_2017_your_opinion_and_impression/
"Arrival (2016)

Coherence (2013)

The Invisible Guest (2016)

The Gift (2015)

The Game (1997)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/lw3ymz/movie_night_recommendations/
If you haven’t seen Grand Budapest Hotel it’s an awesome film!,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/jvd6gp/your_best_movie_suggestions_for_someone_who_has/
Have you seen Band of Brothers?,
Terminator 3 is one of the most hated movie sequels ever made.,https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/jsw64y/what_imdb_movie_ratings_do_you_consider_to_be/
I personally found Salvation far more entertaining than T3.,
"The Dark Knight Rises is a good movie, very ambitious in scope but there's no way that earns an 8.4 on IMDb and a 71 in the top rated movies.",
I would argue that Gone Girl is a much better contender for best of the decade,
Nolan fanboys have a silly impact on the scores of his films.,
"The Social Network made it onto my top 50 at #40, but I doubt Gone Girl would crack the top 100!",
But The Social Network is really an all timer for me,
Parasite being the #1 movie ever is weird,
"As in, quite a few people probably didn't enjoy Come and See, but its classic status pushes it up because people feel like it's on them and they end up giving a 5 because",
"More people think this movie is really good than any other movie at the moment, even if most of them don’t actually think it’s better than The Godfather.",
Back in 08 TDK was subject to vote brigading because it became a rallying cry against the “canon”.,
Interstellar sitting at an 8.5 while Alien and Oldboy are both 8.4 is total bullshit,
5.7 is WAY to high for Battle Los Angeles.,
"Aside from that, reviews are almost always trash and seem to be getting worse with the dilution of quality product. ie Netflix",
I think 9.2 is a little high for Shawshank Redemption.,
"And that goddamn awful editing that got an Oscar somehow, perhaps through sheer popularity",
The Tree of Life is one of the most beautiful film but has only 6.8 rating for some reason.,
Under The Skin is phenomenally good.,
I’m shocked that Jaws and ET have a score of 8/10 and a 7.8 respectively,
Halloween H20 a beloved sequel??? That was one of three movies I’ve ever walked out of the theater and gotten a refund.,
"Showgirls is at a 4.9, Spring Breakers is at a 5.3, Blackhat is at a 5.4 and Conan The Destroyer is a 5.9.",
"SCAM 1992. It’s some new Indian show, and it has a 9.6/10. No other show has a higher rating than it.",
Taxi Driver being at the bottom of the top 100 is a question I will never get an awnser for.,
Also I think Risky Business should be in the upper 7s.,
The Dark Knight Rises sitting at an 8.4 along with being #71 on the Top 250. It's by far Nolan's weakest film and I don't understand how it got up that high.,
The fact that The Witch doesn't even have a 7.0 is a fucking disgrace and completely destroys any reliability in the user scores.,
Repo Man (1984): 6.9 on IMDB.,
BuT tHe MuSic iS rePEtATiVe.,
I just watched Life and it’s by far the worst space movie I ever watched,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/luoko2/whats_the_worst_space_movie_you_have_seen/
Passengers was hyyyyper cringe.,
Armageddon has to be at the top of that list.,
The Green Slime...which terrified my 5 year old self.,
"Gravity, I just found it lacklustre",
clearly you haven’t seen Life or Ad Astra lol,

Lasted thirty minutes and then realised it was boring me to sleep,
"Excision on Amazon Prime.

The Amulet on Hulu

His House on Netflix",https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorMovies/comments/kems5h/horrorthriller_movie_recommendations/
Love Excision. Anything featuring AnnaLynne McCord is gonna be good.,
I started his house on netflix but it was a little slow and sad.,
Shutter Island is great.,
Don't know if you've seen this one (and it doesn't have a 4K Bluray to my knowledge) but Prisoners is also great.,
Yes im going to watch Nightcrawler tonight,
For something more recent - Knives Out? Also available on UHD,
"Second Prisoners, amazing film.",
Seven and The Game from David Fincher.,
"Not my favorite of his, but a lot of people love Zodiac.",
Kiss the Girls.,
The Invisible Man from this year was surprisingly excellent.,
"Probably stretching a bit, but Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is really good.",
I also loved his remake of Insomnia.,
"Black Hawk Down, Jarhead, Fury to name a few are still way better imo",
"Dunkirk is so good, one of the best war films (IMO) ever made.",
I thought tenet was one of his worst movies (which is still very good).,
"I disagree, BHD and Fury are both great but Dunkirk is superior imo",
Hacksaw ridge towers over this as a war movie!,
"Beep Boop, I'm a bot.",
Se7en and Zodiac are incredible thrillers.,
Bad Times at the El Royale is on 4k.,
"Here is a list of movies I have seen & enjoyed

Raid 1 & 2.

The chaser.

The yellow sea.

I saw devil.

"Headhunters and running scared are both really good, headhunters is imo better though.",
also check out eastern promises and history of violence,
"History of violence is by Cronenberg too, sold in that one.",
"some more, just remembered :

district b13

sword of doom (its black and white however the action has aged really well and the movie is quite bloody even when compared to most 21st century action movie )

hard boiled

the killer

unleashed (jet li's best western movie, great action scenes, the punches feel really brutal)",
I loved Running Scared! Not what I expected at all.,
"Undisputed 2&3, and Ninja 2: Shadow of a Tear.",
"Highly recommend, Scott Adkins is the lead in those movies and he is a fantastic martial artist.",
Original Die Hard.,
Bourne Trilogy,
Leon the Professional,
"I know these are a tad older but a couple John Woo/Chow Yun Fat classics, Hard Boiled and The Killer",
"Point Blank, Tell No One, I'm Not Scared, Metro Manila, No Tears For The Dead, Mesrine, City Of God, Elite Squad, Last Stop 174, No Mercy, El Infierno, The Rover, Memoires Of Murder, Infernal Affairs, Black Coal Thin Ice, The Silence, The Connection",
"The Boondock Saints - Two Irish brothers find themselves accidentally starting a mob war in South Boston on St. Patrick's day. Starring Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead), Sean Patrick Flanery and Willum Defoe. Most notable for not having any forced romance.",
"Equilibrium - Orwell's 1984 with Kung-fu gun fights. Starring pre-batman Christain Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs and Emily Watson.",
Kill Bill Part 1 and 2 - Tarantino's love letter to eastern cinema. Watch Uma Thurman slice her way though a list of her former assassin friends to try and Kill Bill.,
Shoot 'em up - Talk about over the top action. Clive Owen stars in this absolutely ridiculous movie.,
"The Kingsmen - This one isn't out on dvd yet, but talk about laugh out loud fight sequences that where just gorgeous. When you hear the name Colin Firth, you think Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, or Mr. Darcy from Bridget Jone's Diary. Basically you think Mr. Darcy, but man, this movie blows that preconception out of the water.",
The Matrix - This movie literally redefined action at the turn of the millennium. Out of nowhere this odd noirish cyber-punk thriller threw out the rule book and created a dozen new techneques that became cliche within months of it's release.,
"Edge of Tomorrow - The author of the book was inspired by watching his kids play Super Mario Brothers. Every time they died, they got better at the level until they were able to play from muscle memory. Tom Cruz and Emily Blunt star.",
Brotherhood of the Wolf - A french film with amazing fights and a unique European style. This is one you have to watch with subtitles as the English dubs are criminally bad.,
The legend of drunken master - I would argue this is the best Jackie Chan film. Dude can only fight when plastered and is able to use the limberness and pain tolerance to his advantage.,
"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - While we are on a foreign movie kick, might as well round it out with the movie that made action BEAUTIFUL. This movie pairs well with the matrix with its gravity defying stunt work.",
"Hero - Ok, this one really finishes out the for foreign movie collection. Jet Li recalls killing China's top assassins. Each fight is unique and compelling and visually stunning like Crouching Tiger.",
Honorable mentions in the Foreign catagory: Ong-Bak,
"The Princess Bride - This is the outlier on the list as it is a ""kids movie"" but this 1987 classic starring Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Andre the Giant, and many many more has hands down the best sword fights in cinema. To not watch this one is INCONCEIVABLE!",
"Scott Pilgrim vs The World - Also not a ""action movie"" but has awesome fight scenes none the less. To me this is the modern Princess Bride as it is a wonderful blend of comedy, action, and romance.",

"If you like Edgar Wright and the action-comedy genre, then I highly recommend Kung Fu Hustle.",
I’d possibly say Mad Max Fury Road where 1) the editing is beautiful and 2) the action and story are so deeply intertwined that you can’t really separate them.,
I have a huge soft spot for the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films,
"I also, unlike some people seem to have, did not hate Wonder Woman 1984.",

"The Host (2006) is by the guy who did Parasite, and it’s probably one of the best creature features ever.",
"The Guest (2014) is a great action thriller (with comedic elements), and generally a hidden gem.",
"It depends partly on what flavor of action you’re looking for. I think Pacific Rim is a great one and has that Edgar Wright balance of comedy, but I figure everyone’s already scene it.",
"For a uniquely 90’s action movie, check out The Long Kiss Goodnight.",
"Snowpiercer, is a decent English language action movie, but The Host (2009) is simply incredible.",
"Tried Raid 1+2? No so much packed with story, but the fight scenes are phenomenal!",
I like the fight scenes that are dance-like too. Matthew Vaughn movies have some good choreographed fights. Most notable is Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kick-Ass. X-men First Class isn't bad either.,
The Rundown with The Rock is one of my favorites.,

"Orphan Black - I loved how the story continue to develop and expand further through the seasons, its a surprise for me that it didnt become huge as other series.

Dark - I like deep and complicated stories. At some point I think it was complex just for the sake of being more complex but is enjoyable to me to decipher the puzzle of the serie.

Altered carbon - I like when stories happen in a such distant future that make us question our own reality. The 2th season isnt good as the first.

Travellers - I wonder how it didnt become huge too because it had a lot of potential. Is shame it was cancelled after 3 seasons.



They arent in any specific order of what I think is better than other.



The worst are:

The I-land - They tried to add too much references, too much information and the story end up a total mess with bad script and cheap cgi.

Another Life - Its not terrible but have some scientific absurds like a doctor doesnt know how to use a doctor tool.

"Upgrade is a great, B-action type of movie that makes the absolute most out of a limited budget. You'd never know based on the visuals. Most people will have lots of fun with this one

Color out of space is great. It's a good step towards the Nick Cage resurgence. They've started casting him well and using his...well.... overacting to their advantage. It's sort of a good companion piece to Mandy, at least visually, and holds pretty true to its Lovecraft heritage

high life wasn't for me and honestly, I think most people will/do feel the same. It's one of the weird films where I know it is good, it is well crafted and shot beautifully, but I just don't think will appeal to most. That said, those who do like it will probably REALLY like it. For that reason is recommend giving it a whirl",

"Hello from somewhere way down the comments.

A few interesting things:

Documentaries:

Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin The original Michael Palin travel show, I believe.

Civilisation If it's the Kenneth Clarke thing, it's a venerable old beast of a documentary series. Probably from a wildly outdated POV, but should be interesting.

Some classic comedies:

Keeping Up Appearances

Only Fools and Horses

The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin

Old stuff, recommended for people that haven't seen it:

Danger Man 60s spy show with the formidable Patrick McGoohan, which started out (on paper) as a James Bond TV show.

The Sandbaggers A more realistic late 70s spy show. It's mostly about the desk-bound intelligence officers and their political masters, not about the action, but it gets very tense.",
Please please please upload Siblings! I've asked for this a couple of times over the past few years but with no response and the copies I can find elsewhere seemingly have no one behind them. Thank you!,
"Fair play. That's some collection! So big, I ended up just looking to see if my favourite shows were there, and you have Black Sails and Flight of the Conchords, so you're a bit of a legend in my book ?? No Futurama though!?! ??",
"An impressive curation! A great mix of drama, comedy, natural history and documentaries. Kudos to you. Very kind of you to consider sharing it. I could eat them all up, but am mainly interested in replacing the shows I lost ( r.i.p HD gone but not forgotten)

Frankie Goes to Russia

Race Across the World season 1

Turkey with Simon Reeve

Worst Place to be a Pilot",
There’s a lot of people here that also like 90days fiancé ...and there are tons of spin-offs and 8 seasons for u to binge on,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterlockup/comments/lwp7py/similar_tv_shows/
60 days in on a&e,
Jailbirds on Netflix is just beautiful.,
"I'm with pretty much everyone here. I started with Married at First Sight, then 90DF, then rewatched 60 days in and LAL. They're all garbage. It's great.",
60 days in-is that undercover in prisons?,
Married at first sight is so meh,
"I didn't see anyone mention ""Marrying Millions"" on Lifetime.",
Bling empire on netflix,
Look up “Love Don’t Judge” on YouTube.,
Shot in the Dark netflix was a fun watch,
Prison Wives Club,
Have you seen Prison Wives?,
I Love A Mama’s Boy was almost as cringeworthy as LAL.,
Southern Charm is on another spectrum but one of my absolute favs ever. 7 seasons out there so plenty to binge if you haven’t watched. Just douchebags w money but plenty of drug rages & drunk debacles.,
Below deck,
Season 8 was kind of meh. Did you see the new episode of BD Sailing?,
"I consider LAL the trashiest show out, but 90 day fiance is pretty close. They have so many spin offs so i dont watch anymore as i dont wanna dedicate 6 hours to it. I recently watched firefly lame show on netflix, not trashy but cute",
Indian matchmaker on Netflix.,
"Love and Hip Hop, Temptation Island, Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders: Making the Team, Black Ink Crew, 90 Day Fiancé.

You are welcome. ??",
"As for other shows, Dark and The Leftovers, and to a lesser extent Mr Robot, give off some Lost vibes, but nothing is truly similar, aside from a few rip off shows that came out while Lost was airing but never took off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/lyhf6f/any_similar_tv_shows_to_lost_and_advice_for/
I think West World might scratch that itch. At least season 1. People don’t tend to like season 2 and season 3 but I think you may like seasons 1 and 2.,
" love lost and own the dvd collection. I watch it all the time. I have it on in the background when I clean, going to bed, scrolling on my phone. I’m addicted. Now that being said I also watch Dexter a lot. I like colony because it has josh Holloway in it ( Sawyer). And I love it but it was canceled so no ending on that show. I’m trying to get into Yellowstone now cause Josh is in season 3 of that show.",
"A show you should try is The Leftovers. It’s on HBO, and it measures up. One of the showrunners is Damon Lindelof and it’s often compared to LOST.",
Check out DARK on Netflix. It's simply amazing.,
100% support DARK. Fucking awesome show.,
Does walking dead have character flashbacks,
"Lost ruined TV for me and nothing else has matched it. Currently, I'm watching Chronologically Lost which is a great twist on the original. I'd suggest watching Lost 2-3 times normally to get really engaged, and then watch chronologically. It puts so many other pieces together.",
Yeah nothing like LOST.,
My favorites have been The OA and Watchmen.,
"Flash Forward was a cool concept. Only lasted 1 season, but Charlie and Penny are in it.",
It’s a shame the show didn’t last longer.,
They went on a stupid hiatus mid-season and it really screwed them over.,
"I just finished rd a few days back, and man I just cannot get over half the characters in the show. Any similar shows? Dark and grimey? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RayDonovan/comments/kbgc1c/similar_tv_shows/
"The Sopranos and The Wire are 2 similar shows and are most definitely superior, and I'm a big Ray Donovan fan. Game of Thrones is fantasy, but has a tonne of dark and grey characters. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul aren't very similar to Ray Donovan, but if you like the character of Ray, himself, you should enjoy them, as there are many characters in both series that remind me of Ray.",
"These are probably horrible suggestions, as they're all better known than RD, but since no one else has commented, I figured I'd go head. Shameless is also on showtime and is full of grimy characters, but I'm not as big a fan as that one. Same with Sons of Anarchy.",
"Great suggestions thus far. Also: Animal Kingdom, Banshee, Boardwalk Empire, Fargo, Goliath, Ozark, Peaky Blinders & True Detective.",
"If we're recommending Banshee, then we should add Strike Back, Quarry, Warrior, etc.",
"Give Lilyhammer a try. It stars Steven Van Zandt from the Sopranos and has a similar vibe to Ray Donovan.

I also liked The Deuce. It’s not quite in the same vein but has a gritty feel to it and some great performances.",
Feel the same withdrawal after finishing Ray Donovan a few wks ago. Loved those characters. Justified. Longmire. Rectify. I saw mention of The Wire - all time best.,
"Justified, Banshee, Gangs Of London, The Wire, Snowfall, Strike Back, Ozark, Berlin Station, Deep State. I just started watching Animal Kingdom and I think that may be the closest to Ray Donovan in my opinion, but all of the above are fantastic shows.

I personally loved Strike Back although I guess in reality I only really enjoyed the Stonebridge/Scott seasons but I've watched them all.",
Bloodline,
"Watch Bosch, you'll dig it.",
"Animal Kingdom, Banshee, Breaking Bad, Better call Saul, Fargo, Ozark, Arrested Development, GoT, Snowfall.",
Warehouse 13,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLibrarians/comments/jjcmhz/similar_tv_shows/
"Just finished the series (i want more) and now I need something else to watch. Does anyone know of any shows like the Librarians? I'm talking magic, adventure, shenanigans, maybe some found family! I've seen Once Upon A Time, which also has these vibes. If you can help me out, I'd really appreciate it!",
"May be an obvious recommendation, but ""Leverage"" was the previous show by the same producers, I believe. No magic, but same vibe, with a good cast of characters going through shenanigans and, in my opinion, tighter writing and less childish, though still silly and lighthearted throughout. It's pretty much the A-Team meets Ocean's Eleven.",
Have you tried Doctor Who?,
"DC Legends of Tomorrow, Dr Who, Magicians, Alphas, Heroes all fit similarly to me",
"It’s not magic, but have you ever seen the show Chuck? It’s really good. Edit: in addition to warehouse 13, scorpion is kinda similar in that it’s a group of anti social geniuses who go around trying to fix problems (usually causing destruction and mayhem).",
"I haven't watched it yet, but I've heard Relic Hunter has similar vibes (and also Lindy aka Cassandra is in it)",
The Legend of the monkey King is a great show. Its got that same camp feel and style that the Librarians had.,
Scorpion it’s a tv show about very smart nerds working for the government solving crimes.,
"Dimension 20, College Humor's d&d show -- especially the first season (Fantasy High -- basically high fantasy meets John Hughes) but also the second season (The Unsleeping City - New York with a secret, magical underworld).",
"It's so good - funny, exciting, emotional, heartfelt, and cathartic. Absolutely CHOCK FULL of all of magic, adventure, shenanigans, and SO MUCH found family. The format takes a little getting used to (it's a cast of professional comedians sitting around a table, basically telling a story collaboratively, sometimes with dice, sometimes with miniatures) but absolutely worth it.",
Try galavant. Great cast and amazing music. Really funny and found family. Sadly only 3 seasons,
"Not similar but the only two sub reddits im a part of for UK comedies are this one and peep show, I would argue they are the two best British comedies, although im sure many will disagree. Still worth a shout, it also gets better as it goes along, they mastered the roles over time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ITcrowd/comments/hmhb9v/recommendations_for_similar_tv_shows_please/
"Community is one of my alllllll time favorites, it has such a great ensemble cast. Very quirky and experimental, with great characters and plot lines.",
"IMO, Spaced always felt similar to IT Crowd.",
