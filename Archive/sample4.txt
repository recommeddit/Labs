The movie interstellar that we watched yesterday was frickin awesome. 
I have just watched a movie of Darren Aronofsky Mother! and I had mixed feelins after watching it. 
Have you seen Band of Brothers?
Terminator 3 is one of the most hated movie sequels ever made. II personally found Salvation far more entertaining than T3.
