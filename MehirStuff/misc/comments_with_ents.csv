0,"ranger has just that tiny bit too much of lag, nnn I do use regularly"
1,"Way too many letters. vim, feh(or eog) and mpv will handle 99.9% of the files I'd want to open."
2,lf - fast ranger
3,lf gang
4,ranger
5,"If you use ssh to get to other computer file systems then mc is the easiest one to use for that. That being said, nnn is my goto tool since it's blazing fast even on low powered machines like the Raspberry pi. It has single key shortcuts, navigate as you type functionality and the smallest footprint possible. A good basic knowledge of shell commands like cd and mkdir is always useful but once you get into bulk renaming and multiple file name and file type moving then a fast file manager is the right tool. If you would like to have image and file previews as you navigate then ranger is the one for you but keep in mind that this feature is amazing on fast machines while it becomes a nightmare on slow ones."
6,"Indeed mc *used* to be the easiest one for ssh. I've been using the nnn remote mount for some time now, I stand corrected."
7,"Probably unpopular opinion here:  If I really need a file-manager, my go to is emacs + dired + tramp.   Otherwise zsh + coreutils + awk, sed, grep etc. is more than enough."
8,"I used to use nnn but I had some issues (my own fault probably) and went with fff, but they are extremely similar."
9,"Ranger. I know a lot of people like vifm, but I couldn't get into it. Ranger is vim like enough for me, and I'm used to it. I've also got it set up the way I want so changing to something else is just a pita."
10,"At some point even I thought that I am more than good with running the utilities and working iteratively e.g.  - run grep, copy the first file path in the list (select and middle paste) and edit... then go back to the second - cd, ls, vi OR run command with fish/zsh shell's TAB/auto completion... cd...  ranger changed my outlook towards content visibility as I could see the complete directory at once and just go to the file, hover and work with it.  Found nnn much later. The first thing that hooked me was the filtered navigation mode (just type the partial names to automatically cd or filter out a file). zsh has something similar but nnn's implementation is somehow instant even with 1000s of files in /usr/bin. Also, the matches are visible nicely sorted. Later I explored more and found several useful features. Speaking of the above 2 use cases - nnn makes these workflows look absolutely trivial. The first one is covered by find & list (you always have the list of results with you) and the second one by continuous filtered navigation."
11,Mc
12,"I used Norton Commander in the DOS times. Since then, I cannot live without an NC clone. It's the first thing that I need to install on a new system."
13,"Same here. There was also [DOS Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Navigator), NC on steroids - was very sad when it's development ended. MC is better that NC, but not even touching the level on DOS Navigator... ahhh, good'ol'days..."
14,"**DOS Navigator**  DOS Navigator (DN) is an orthodox file manager for DOS, OS/2 and Windows.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/commandline/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"
15,vifm
16,"As a vi guy, I've been using vifm for many years now and have often recommended it here on reddit and sites like kmandla's old blog.  But in my opinion it's beginning to suffer from feature bloat, so I'm considering alternatives.  To my mind, the ""vi way"" is to leverage external programs as much as possible rather than building the same functionality into a single, monolithic program.  vifm seems to be straying from that path, in an attempt perhaps to match Midnight Commander feature for feature...  File managers, btw, are to the shell utilities (cp, mv, etc.) what full-screen text editors like vi or emacs are to ed.   They show you the context of what you're working on and many people (including myself) find this useful.  &#x200B;"
17,Nerdtree adds some nice improvements to vim's file browser.
18,"I haven't tried nnn, but I love ranger. Ranger is much faster for me to use than either a GUI file manager or a the standard bash tools.  Granted, I don't use it for everything. If I know the file I want,       $ cp ~/my_file.txt ~/Documents/my_file_copy.txt  And the like are much more convenient than opening ranger.  But if I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, or just want to browse my files, ranger saves so much time over      cd ~/foo; ls ~/foo; cat bar.txt  rinse, repeat."
19,`z` is a must have
20,`ranger`
21,Ranger.. I tried Thunar and came straight back to Ranger.
22,"Usually just shell, but sometime also lf. lf is similar to ranger but faster, lighter, and configurable with shell: https://github.com/gokcehan/lf"
23,"Technically not a standalone file manager and I don't use it in the terminal, but dired in Emacs is probably the most powerful (having used ranger before) file manager I can think of. "
24,ranger is number 1
25,`emacs`
26,"Bash does most jobs well enough, but I like the dual panes of mc for comparing directories or moving select files from one to the other. You can also configure mc to open files using a default program, which is nice. "
27,Ranger. I am curious to how midnight commander  contends with ranger. I like ranger since I am familiar with python enough that I can add my own custom commands very easily. I don't know how I could navigate efficiently using any gui. I spend most of my time clucking icons where in ranger I can click three keys to get to where I need to be. It is marvelous. 
28,explorer.exe
29,Plus either ConEmu or Cmder come with enhanced far support built-in.
30,The new nnn is pretty baller.
31,The latest version of `nnn` has many features which were pending for a while. I've been developing this alone and it took some time to reach here. :)
32,Standard Unix commands + ‘fzf’ works well for me.   In some cases I like ‘tree’ and occasionally ‘vifm’
33,I used ranger forever. I heard about nnn and I'll be trying that one soon. Only other one I kinda like is [**Last File Manager**](https://www.linuxlinks.com/LastFileManager/)**(lfm).** But you can't forget about Midnight Commander(mc)
34,"tree, mv, cp, tar"
35,"Tab completion + zsh is good enough that I never need anything else, but I do like ranger."
36,"CLI is Command Line Interface. CLI ""file manager"" I prefer is zsh.  What you mean called TUI. ranger is a TUI file manager, not CLI. I use vifm for that."
37,"I'm currently using vifm. I used ranger before, but for some reason I changed."
38,WinSCP. :P
39,"They are quite useful — zsh or bash are quite powerful.  I had the same opinion for a while too.  However, if you have a collection of files and need to select a set of those files for an operation and there isn't an easy way to do it with names, that's a good one.  I used to fire up mc occasionally; now I use emacs's dired."
40,tree and awk are my gotos for that
41,I thought mv was standard? Or do you just mean it lacks the functionality you would like?
42,"Yes, mv is standard; and yes, I'm talking about a lot of the functionality with wildcards while renaming, features the DOS/Windows rename command has."
43,"Most Unix systems have perl.  The `perl` package has prename (which at least Debian symlinks `rename` to).  That gives you a vastly-more-powerful-than-wildcards feature where you can apply Perl expressions to each filename that you want (and use whatever crazy features your shell has to select the files to operate on).  Eg.      $ rename s/foo/bar/ *.jpg  will change ""foo"" to ""bar"" in all your .jpg filenames in the current directory.  You could ROT-13 encode, change the case of, modify file extensions, etc on your files.  Also, if you use emacs, and you use emacs's file browser, `dired`, you can use `M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode`, which makes your dired buffer editable as a text file.  When you're done, you just hit `C-c C-c`, and the changes to filenames are applied.  Gives you all the functionality of emacs to do renames."
44,Coreutils ftw
45,[You lose none of that with Midnight Commander](http://www.nawaz.org/media/docs/mc/mc.pdf)
46,"I'm strictly a terminal user when it comes to managing files (no file manager), but I downloaded Ranger and I'm impressed.  It's extremely responsive and the default vi bindings made it second nature to navigate."
47,"I don't have the 'hang' problem here. How many file are there in your directory? Does it always hang on a particular file/filetype? I'm using ranger 1.5.4-1 on Debian testing  The thing i miss in ranger is a menu bar like aptitude has, so I wouldn't always have to browse the help page to remind me of available commands."
48,MC 4 LYFE
49,"I got started with mc's predecessor, Norton Commander. mc was a very welcome discovery when I started using Linux."
50,For those who have yet to hear about it: `vidir` from Debian's `moreutils` package (don't know where other distros keep it) is a very handy tool sometimes.   Also (although unrelated to the topic of file management): rest of `moreutils` is also worth getting familiar with.
51,"*vifm* is very fast and nice, however it has a lot of features that are only mentioned and not fully documented. So there's functionality there that you want to use, but don't know how."
52,"Pff, emacs' dired-mode rules them all."
53,microemacs (me) also has a file explorer (using F10) that is very nice.
54,I think the same things about the Perl and Ruby communites.
55,pcmanfm
56,Thunar and pcmanfm
57,I use thunar and nnn
58,"Double commander, pcmanfm-qt, dolphin"
59,"I like ranger, has bulkrename which is useful"
60,Dolphins plugins are pretty handy.
61,"Can you recomend any good plugins? I also use dolphin but just the base version with some icon previews and ""ark"""
62,Midnight commander (mc) for terminal
63,I really don't have a favorite. SpaceFM is nice.  As for CLI file manager's. I guess I do have two favorite ones. Which are ranger and nnn.
64,I quite enjoy ranger
65,ranger for sure
66,LF
67,Thunar. Even in Gnome.
68,I like ranger for the terminal and pcmanfm for gui.
69,"Whatever comes with your Desktop Environment.   If you're on a WM, then Thunar or PCmanFM.   Ranger is a good TUI \[Terminal\] file manager"
70,"I like dolphin, the integrated terminal is slick. The directory open in the gui will automatically sync with the current directory in the terminal"
71,Emacs
72,"Nemo is my favorite, Nautilus is my least favorite, lxde's file manager whatever it's called is just above Nautilus, everything else including Windows Explorer is ""meh it's okay."""
73,Thunar
74,Nemo.
75,"Thunar is cool and light, Caja is cooler but not thaat light"
76,vifm is definitely worth a look for vim people.
77,Pcmanfm
78,Dolphin
79,"Have you used mc (Midnight Commander) before? If so, could you explain the pros/cons with lf vs mc?"
80,"This has been asked in other subreddits as well but unfortunately I only tried `mc` very briefly just to see what it's like. I know it has a dual panel design and you can enter shell commands directly by typing I think. For `lf` dual panel can be achieved by using `tmux` for multiplexing. I have something about this in the example config file in the repo. In `lf` in order to run shell commands you need to type a key first (e.g. `!`, `$` and `&`). Other than that, there is some support for autocompletion for shell commands which I don't remember if `mc` has or not.  `lf` is more comparable to `ranger` though and I have a comparison for it in here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/55nzvd/lf_a_terminal_file_manager/  Maybe if there is a comparison between `mc` and `ranger` somewhere, that could help."
81,Midnight Commander really is the best file manager I've ever seen. I made a presentation about it some years ago. You can find it in a link [here](http://blog.nawaz.org/posts/2012/Dec/a-guide-to-midnight-commander/).
82,"I actually mention Far in my presentation. I've used both, but am more familiar with MC. I've seen pluses to each that did not exist in the other, so I cannot claim one is better than the other.  Drag and drop: I think MC has it within itself (not from Window manager to it). I personally do not care for it either way as I find the benefit of Far/MC is the ability to do everything with the keyboard.   Explorer context menu: Definitely good, but only relevant in Windows.  File editor/viewer/archive manager. Both have them.  Does Far let me SFTP to other sites and treat them like local drives? Also, I've not found a good way to bookmark directories in Far..."
83,"> Does Far let me SFTP to other sites and treat them like local drives?  I am not sure. It allows for regular FTP at least and the plugin system would certainly allow for such a feature, since the FTP client is a plugin itself.  > Also, I've not found a good way to bookmark directories in Far...  This is simple: Press [F2] to bring up the user menu and press [INS] to add an item.  **Hotkey**: As a hotkey, use any letter, digit or F... key you want. I simply try to default to the first letter of the command, so for the command to go into the bat file directory, I use `b`.  **Label**: This simply is the label that is shown on the menu  **Commands**: Lines of valid CMD commands to execute. You can press [F1] and select ""Special symbols"" for some interesting variables. This is useful for example to build yourself git commands together. To bookmark a folder, simply enter `CD /D C:\your\folder\name`  Save your changes. In the future to switch to that directory, simply press [F2] and then the hotkey you assigned."
84,Also have you tried ranger? I was wondering how this compared
85,"We still need to implement colorschemes. I think colorschemes in termbox is a little limited for portability considerations (i.e. Windows) but we might be able to do 256 colors, not quite sure though. Also I was told that colors in `lf` is not consistent with `dircolors`. I need to check it out when I have some time."
86,"I don't know much about homebrew so I shall better not submit anything myself but if there is anything I can do I would be happy to help. If anyone submits a formula, s/he can ping me and I can add the installation instructions to the readme."
87,"`mc`, is a classic, `nnn` is very popular. `ranger` I recall is also popular.  I have been using `mc` for like decades I think.. :) or similar two pane file managers.."
88,"`nnn` seems to be popular with the minimalists, but I prefer the expansive view and file previews of `ranger`. I haven't tried it, but I hear `mc` is the OG."
89,ranger
90,I'm a fan of ranger.
91,Love Ranger and MC and use both interchangeably.
92,"Ye olde reliable `mc` works for me, but there are many others to choose from too."
93,Try out vifm
94,Another vote to ranger. I haven't used anything else but I saw screenshots of others and ranger is the one that looked better. I haven't had many complains about it.
95,"Not completely relevant here, but for anyone using Android who likes this sort of thing there is a file manager called Total Commander that is excellent."
96,nnn is bullet-fast
97,Lf. It's like ranger but much more customisable.
98,"`ranger` is the best!  Built to be easy to customize, with sensible defaults, and written in `python` (for further customization ease if you know python).  Beware that ranger can sometimes be a bit weird about error messages.  If you use `emacs -nw`, then `dired` is also a viable option."
99,"I mostly use [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf), nnn is good too, ranger is slow as hell"
100,"I'm with you. I never spent too much time learning a file manager because I always felt I'd forget or become worse at basic *nix utilities to do stuff. I'm not sure that idea is really founded at all, but that's how I felt. I played with Midnight Commander and Norton Utilities for a bit in my old DOS days."
101,vifm
102,"Vifm is my goto.   90% I'm using z.lua and all the other core utils but for that 10% I zuse vifm since it has everything. Previews, intuitive you name it"
103,you could do the same with nnn as a selection of files is just a file shared by the different instances of nnn
104,I use Broot https://github.com/Canop/broot
105,"Broot is wonderful, and more so all the time."
106,"Due to decades-long habit, I prefer 2-pane file managers. mc has a Windows version too, so I can use the same one under Linux and Windows. Boring but efficient for me.  I also use nnn from time to time."
107,"I'm using ranger, because image previews worked out of the box. I mean, I have skills to make it work in others, but I was just oo lazy."
108,lfm is my goto..needs updating as it's quite unstable especially with copying and moving large files having said that i use ranger too.
109,"CliFM is not written in Haskell, it's written in C. And yes, it might be a bit weird, because it is unique in this respect, but that's the price for keeping the shell always in sight. As everything nonetheless, there are pros and cons."
110,There’s an alternative called nnn.  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nnn
111,Try ranger.
112,"> where the hell is the name of the app/program/package/command that makes the terminal navigate folders like a File manager and even preview file content  It's called Ranger. It's really a slick terminal program. I just tested it to make sure my recall was right, and saw three columns:  * Left column: folders.  * Middle column: files.  * Right column: sample contents of readable files.          $ sudo apt install ranger"
113,"vifm is easily the most powerful, yet simple to use for the basics, FM I have ever seen.  people who already use and like vim should definitely try this.  Edit: someone downvoted this?  I didn't even say anything against the others.  Now I feel cheated!"
114,When working on a project NerdTree is often enough :P
115,"Try nnn, ranger or mc"
116,From the screenshot I'd say it's ranger. It supports various ways of file previews. See https://github.com/ranger/ranger
117,Try ranger or mc
118,"PCManFM - lightweight, supports GTK themes, all I need."
119,"I tried switching to PCManFM from Thunar and I didn't like how it doesn't select the previous folder when going back. Similar issue when deleting a file, it doesn't select the next file so pressing an arrow takes you to the top of the list. Maybe I'm missing a config option but that made it unusable for me.  Edit: pcmanfm-qt seems to behave more reasonably"
120,Another vote the PCManFM. Highly recommend it. It’s efficient and comfortable.
121,"For GUI stuff, Dolphin. Just because it's KDE's default. I have nothing to complain.."
122,"Dolphin has a neat integrated terminal. I just press F4 and it opens a tab with a CLI. If i need sudo, i just do it in the terminal. Since i do work with some backend and SSH, i am used to edit files with sudo on the terminal. It a matter of practice"
123,"I love Dolphin, but one of my most requested features is to order ""hidden files and folders"" at the bottom (similar to the default behavior in Nemo).  This request was rejected because [every option makes the code more complex, and adds additional code paths](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333219), which blew my mind considering the millions of options within KDE."
124,"Funny, I use Nautilus, and wish it sorted hidden folders at the top like Dolphin does. I also wish Nautilus had those little check-mark boxes for (de)selecting folders.  Honestly, if Dolphin didn't have so many dependencies, I'd use it in Gnome. Nautilus is such a crappy, barebones file manager."
125,I never used Dolphin for something that requires elevated privileges.
126,"Cli or vifm, the latter is handy for vim commands that can edit in bulk via the visual mode commands"
127,Midnight Commander. Because Norton Commander was the first file manager i have ever used.
128,Same here but PC tools -> Norton commander
129,"Thunar - it gets the job done I need in Xfce4.  A related tool I love is `ncdu`, which makes looking for files to delete very easy."
130,Ncdu rocks
131,Another Thunar user here - it works for what I need it for so I've just never really found a need to go to anything else.  `ncdu` is also great.
132,"Me too! Also I use xfce-terminal for my main! I don't even use them in xfce either, I've been using qtile. But that terminal does transparent background, does what I want, can't complain. Ditto for Thunar. And really I only mess with Th when I'm in X already and not doing it in terminal for whatever reason, I haven't been messing with files and folders much."
133,One thing I absolutely don't appreciate about thunar is lack of built-in search tool
134,"Also works great with Openbox. Never heard of `ncdu` before, should check it out tomorrow."
135,Thunar is good. I use window managers most of the time and found that Dolphin handles themes poorly since there are dependencies on KDE services. GNOME Files (Nautilus) is good for both GNOME and a standalone window manager.
136,"lf + thunar  lf really gets the job done. it's simple and has default vim keybindings which is nice.  but when I need a more ""visual"" manager I use thunar. (+ for drag and dropping into a browser)"
137,i like ranger
138,"Me too. I like it customizability and flexibility. It's even better when combined with the ranger-plugin that come [z.lua](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua), which I have bound to cj (I used auto-jump before this, which used that binding as well).  I also really like how well it integrates with my keyboard-driven setup. I'm on i3 and I use a lot of programs that have similar keybindings, like Neovim and qutebrowser. i can even use it inside Neovim (including all settings and plugins)."
139,Ranger is the way to go.
140,I switched from ranger to `lf`. Its like ranger but noticeably faster.
141,"None, just the CLI."
142,Hackerman!
143,or a fuzzy finder
144,I use fzf
145,whereis
146,fzf AND ripgrep
147,Nemo and vifm
148,Dired.   Because it is included with Emacs :). Just kidding. Because it is completely keyboard driven.
149,"Dired, because Emacs."
150,Primarily dired (emacs) but also pcmanfm and CLI when appropriate.
151,"Dolphin, because plasma ! For the development stuff I use treemacs inside emacs-doom ."
152,"I actually like dolphin, it’s pretty nice."
153,Midnight commander. You absolutely don't need mouse for this one.
154,"nemo, as nautilus refused to remember settings per directory..."
155,"I notice on my work laptop, ranger has a ridiculous 2s startup time. So I resorted to lf, which is inspired by ranger and much faster"
156,"Ever tried nnn? It's also partially inspired by ranger, but is written in C (lf is written in Go). It's also [way faster](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Performance) than ranger. So fast, in fact, that it can list a directory [2 times faster than `ls`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Performance#nnn-vs-ls)."
157,"I did try it, but couldn't figure out the preview window of folders and files. I didn't try very hard though. And also nnn is only configurable with envvars, and that is pretty tedious as well. Lf was the easier choice, but might check out nnn again soon!"
158,"I use pcmanfm-qt, because it's DE-independent and I don't use an specific DE.  And, also, as a terminal file manager, I use ranger. Really powerful!"
159,"I just use plain old pcmanfm.  I never got the hang of qt, but I think I need to start learning qt, maybe one day it will take over GTK."
160,Ranger like in POWER RANGERS!!!
161,dired
162,Emacs dired-mode. And I use emacs for almost everything except browser and some graphical suites like gimp or ardour.
163,"One file manager? What is this Windows?   Install 3, like you know you should.   I use Nautilus when I run on systems with reasonable ram because everything just works. I am also too terrified by the idea of deleting Nautilus from Gnome to even try it.   I use pcmanFM when I run on more limited systems.   And finally the terminal, because sometimes you need that.  Very easy."
164,"You can use dragon for the drag'n'drop functionality. So with  vifm+dragon you don't even need any kind of graphical file manager. Also, I think that catfish can be easily replaced by fzf."
165,"I tried dragon in the past and forgot about it after a reinstall, but I'll try it again. And I've heard wonders about fzf, I used exclusively for vim but replaced it for the built-in file search functionality, I'm curious to learn to use it more generally. Thanks for the suggestions."
166,"Krusader almost exclusively. I am trying to make it work as close as possible to total commander, but I have a long ways to go."
167,I had more luck getting Double Commander to be like TotalCommander. But I also had a very customized tcmd setup so my needs may be different than yours.
168,"KDE's `Dolphin` 'cause I like it, works fine for my needs and... Well... It's part of KDE.  I heavily use `F3` and `F4` shortcuts/features and I like that way."
169,"Dolphin mostly because of the feature which allows you to open a terminal panel in the folder you are in. I use it all the time to do quick operations on file or git commands.  Also, being  part KDE, you can customize the toolbar and all that, which is a good thing."
170,"Ranger is a beast, vim like commands"
171,"Nemo.   Supports SMB/NFS/SFTP mounts with an addon, can split in half (F3) to easily compare, supports tabs, open folders as root, and even open my terminal to the folder I was currently in (You can set the default terminal that opens).   I've used it for years, never needed anything else."
172,"1. Mostly terminal stuff for simple tasks.  2. Thunar for more common drag & drop operations.  3. Double Commander for more ""complex"" tasks."
173,Emacs and dired
174,"Nemo, Thunar and MC"
175,Using Nemo because it was the first one I got to work
176,Nemo is basically Nautilus if it were good
177,"I'm using ranger at the moment because I wanted something that was entirely keyboard based. I'm not sure how I feel about yet, but that's heavily related to the fact that I don't know all the hotkeys yet :P  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ranger"
178,"For GUI : Dolphin, although it causes problems with android phones sometimes.  For CLI : nnn"
179,"SpaceFM, I never see *anyone* mention this great file manager. Otherwise just CLI shiet"
180,"I'm currently using KDE Plasma, so Dolphin. When I was fiddling around with i3wm, I used ranger."
181,"Dolphin for the GUI, nvim-tree from CLI."
182,Dolphin because it comes with plasma. Honorable mention :  Thunar; Thunar has the best GUI bulk rename utility I've ever seen
183,Went from dolphin to thunar to pcmanfm.. Just need something that I can get to work and not fancy
184,I have ranger nnn and vifm installed but to be honest I mostly use Pcmanfm because when I don't need to do something that is easier through GUI I just navigate through ls and cd.
185,"I like pcmanfm in my GUI. For a TUI, ranger will do just fine."
186,i use pcmanfm I like it alot.
187,"Dolphin, because I'm a monster that runs kde."
188,"Pcmanfm-qt, it works for my minimal Wayland setup with hikari... it reminds me of the good old-days of LXDE. I prefer command line operation tbh."
189,ranger
190,Was on Nautilus for over 10 years but shifted to dolphin recently
191,"I got `vifm` and set it up when I switched to Arch, but nowadays I do almost all of my file management directly in the terminal."
192,I don't think there's a single good one. Finder on Mac has columns. Ranger has them but is text-only.
193,"Dolphin, but prefer mc/micro."
194,"Dired within Emacs, and I'm in Emacs all the time anyway. I've tried most of the others mentioned here and I just prefer it. I'd rather use one thing, and if it lacks a feature I can just write a bit of elisp."
195,Dolphin or sometimes just the terminal for moving/copying stuff.
196,"pcmanfm is great but its thumbnails were too inconsistent for me to keep it around. I moved to thunar recently and tbh it feels like pcmanfm but more plugin support and extra things I can opt in/out of as I need them. I don't really want to code my own config for a file manager, else I'll just open ranger or vifm"
197,Thunar. It's lightweight and comes default with xfce. I'm not into terminal based file managers.
198,"Thunar, because I am on xfce. Btw, I use Void :)"
199,Thunar ftw
200,i use PCManFM cause it was the one that poped up in my mind first when setting up my install.
201,ls and cd
202,"For cli, mc is the gold standard."
203,I mainly navigate via command line but if i use a file manager i use thunar or ranger. I also have nnn installed and i love that it has tabs but i never really use it.
204,"ranger also has tabs. maybe you already knew that, but it took me over a year of use to find out, so"
205,Mostly the CLI but sometimes I use pcmanfm for convenience. It's nice and light and does all I need.
206,mostly midnight commander and sometimes caja because I'm on mate and it is lightweight enough and native for mate. Can filezilla be considered as file manager? :)
207,"Depends on what I’m doing. If I’m just moving a few files or opening images Thunar is my favorite for various reasons, mostly the defaults related to my uses. Nothing important or features that cannot be used on others.   CLI for all else."
208,"I mostly navigate in terminal using cd and ll (ls -lvh IIRC). Drag and drop files through dragon (with a convenient ddad alias because in arch it is ""dragon-drag-and-drop""). If I need some more power, I use ranger. It's quite handy with a plugin for mounting through udisksctl."
209,"Thunar, because is easily customisable and get the job done"
210,Vim and thunar.
211,I currently use dolphin (kind of) but only for opening appimages. Every single other need you could have for a file manager is achieved faster with just the terminal.
212,"I have Thunar since it's part of my xfce setup, but I only use it as an alternative for when I'm in a mouse-heavy workflow. However, I've found it to work pretty well using just the keyboard sometimes.   As my main file manager, I really like ""lf"". It's similar to Ranger and other terminal-based, miller column, vim-like, file managers, but it's more minimalist by default and was much faster than Ranger in my experience. It's deliberately lacking some features (like tabs) that can be handled better in other ways (I personally use i3 tabbed windows.) It's very customisable but the project wiki has lots of good documentation and easy tips to expand functionality, so I think it's good even for a beginner. Ranger and other more complex file managers confused me when I first tried them because they just covered too much ground, whereas lf starts more sane and simple, allowing you to build it up to your own preferences."
213,"When I use a terminal based file-manager, my go-to is ranger."
214,pcmanfm still rocks.
215,"When I do have a DE, I use whatever the DE offers. If not, it's ranger. With ranger, it's pretty simple. It does everything you'd typically need (file and image previews, easy search, plenty of customization for other things too)"
216,Pcmanfm is my file manager of choice. Just works well and does not come with a ton of dependencies as many others do.
217,"When I am not in a terminal I use nautilus. I have been using bspwm as my window manager for a couple years, though. Looking for recommendations if someone has any."
218,"The terminal, and sometimes thunar."
219,Also mainly use nautilus. Sometimes thunar for renaming.
220,Dolphin cuz it's KDE's default and it's very feature rich
221,"Thunar. It's what came with xfce when I first installed endeavour and I was too lazy to install anything else on my desktop's arch install. Pretty decent, nothing too fancy, but it gets the job done."
222,"For me it's either dolphin or coreutils (cd, ls, find, etc.)."
223,Thunar + PCManFM  I'll switch back to just Thunar once [this bug](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/issues/451) gets resolved.
224,ranger for the terminal (although I will probably switch to lf) pcmanfm for the gui
225,"Dolphin..because it's default in KDE, and one of the most versatile graphical filemanagers out there, at least to my knowledge."
226,"I'm using Vifm + dragon + ueberzug and I have ditched any graphical file-manager since dragon manage the drag'n'drop functionality. It's blazing fast and reliable. Going  CLI-only is good as well, zsh + fasd (jumping functionality) is ideal in this case."
227,"pcmanfm. It's familiar to me, easy to use, easy to use with ssh. I also use mc from time to time whenever I'm terminal heavy."
228,Dolphine or Nautilus
229,I'm so happy with ranger though. 
230,ranger is very slow
231,cd on exit isn't working for me with osx mohave/python 3.7
232,"In fact it works quite well on Cygwin, Linux subsystem for Windows 10, Raspberry Pi and Termux."
233,Noice
234,Danke! ;)
235,"Glad to see your efforts on improving `nnn`. I use it a lot, it's a godsend on RasPi-like SBCs. But I found also good usage for it on my main Linux PCs.  For everybody pushing `ranger`: I use `mc` and `nnn`, each for different purposes. A test of `ranger` didn't give a good impression for me - too confusing, kind of in between `mc` and `nnn`, but not as good as either.  You should try `nnn`, and also the other utilities /u/sablal wrote. He has a knack for writing useful and lean apps. `nnn` is less than 30kB for the binary, with a ton of features. In contrast, look at `Etcher`, which clocks in at 100MB as an AppImage (only available Linux option) and doesn't anything else besides writing an image to disk and verifying it.  I am disgusted by this trend and wish there would be more like `nnn`, not like `Etcher`."
236,Thank you for the appreciation. Personally I use `nnn` for all my workflows so I have to keep it well-maintained. ;) On my desktop I use Terminator which gives me the dual pane/multi-tab functionality.
237,Looks good. Jarun's googler is a good project. Trying it out.
238,"Just another update. I took the plunge and installed MS Word / MS OneNote. The pressure sensitivity actually works great. They are useless for manipulating PDFs, however - Word ""converts"" the PDF via some online service... into a buggy mess. OneNote imports it OK, but can't export it right.  So I still have no solution for how to use this tablet at all. :-("
239,Try OpenBoard ([https://openboard.ch/index.en.html](https://openboard.ch/index.en.html)). It works really well: you can easily import/export pdfs and the pressure sensitivity is good.
240,"Oh wow, thanks so much man. That does indeed do both of those. Bit of a weird interface but it's lightweight, responsive, and does everything I need, so I can get used to one or two quirks. Can't believe how long it took me to find a program to do this - I even asked Wacom support the other day and they had no idea - so thanks again for the help! Problem solved :-)"
241,"Unfortunately, Notability [doesn't support](https://support.gingerlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/205724867-Writing-with-Bluetooth-Styluses) pressure sensitivity, except with the Apple Pencil (there was some conflicting info on this, so, I bought and tried it, but it doesn't work)."
242,"Oh, wow, thank you very much! In that case, I'll keep an eye on Notability and hope that they do add that feature in the future."
243,"(for reference, i'm using the old wacom intuos P S tablet) - I had the same question a few days ago, since I was trying to use goodnotes, but writing with a tablet plugged into my mac was godawful (I could barely write words at all, they would just show up as dots, but my tablet wrote fine in other apps like onenote.)  However, I just realized that goodnotes updated their mac app like six days ago, and the writing is working just like other annotating apps now! plus, I noticed mine works with pressure sensitivity."
244,Hey! can I ask you something but not answer your question?  Why did you decide on WACOM and not a tablet? I am researching the best way to annotate in PDF and I came across WACOM. Do you think reading on the tablet doesn't make much difference?
245,Stupid question - why are you using the Wacom is you have an iPad?
246,"* My university distributed Wacom tablets. I didn't seek it out  * If I could use it to annotate PDFs I would slightly prefer it to the iPad for use during Zoom lectures, because I wouldn't have to juggle an additional screen, or deal with the various issues I've encountered with having to continually switch host back and forth to the iPad or problems with Airplay. I also wouldn't have to worry about accidentally marking up my primary lecture material on my iPad."
247,"Actually so far it works OK with Zoom -- it seems like they have put special effort into making that work fairly well. My general worry with Airplay stems from it not working with anything that doesn't specifically support it, like Google meets."
248,Do you use an iPad? My searching has only yielded screensharing in the other direction (from desktop to iPad). How do you share your iPad screen to your desktop mac?
249,"OK. Some software has a presentation mode (Powerpoint, Acrobat), that only shows the slides. I don't know if those modes ever work for asynchronous video production."
250,I used Wacom and preview in Mac. If you open your pdf in preview your Wacom should be supported for markup.
251,"If you want full support, there’s the adobe suite, but nothing free comes to mind unfortunately. If you install the Wacom driver you should be able to set the hot buttons on the tablet to your preference though (such as color or stroke width) and that should work for most applications."
252,"I use a Wacom Intuos with Ubuntu\* to correct/grade student homework which is submitted as a pdf.  &#x200B;  I use xournal ([http://xournal.sourceforge.net/](http://xournal.sourceforge.net/)).  You can set one of the pen buttons to activate the eraser while your holding it.    There is xournal++ ([https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)) which might have the same features.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  \*i originally had a problem with the intuos where half the tablet would be used and just weird screen behavior.  it took a long time to troubleshoot so i want to mention here in case anyone had the same problem and found their way here: the intuos can work with android phones and when plugged into a phone goes into 'android mode'.  when you plug an intuos into a computer using ubuntu, it might think it's a phone and go into android mode.  to switch out of android mode, hold the two outer buttons on the tablet until the indicator light on the tablet gets brighter (like 2 or 3 seconds)."
253,"This is more for windows machines, but I've found that Microsoft applications do a good job with pen/annotation.  Powerpoint is one example, but like you said it doesn't work for pdfs.  For PDFs, I use the microsoft edge browser.  You open the pdf inside edge, you'll get a menu across the top that allows you to choose color and thickness of lines."
254,"I'm having the same issue. The stylus works really well with the art software included, but it's not possible to open or import .pdf files in this software. Using the stylus with Mac preview seems laggy. I have an old version of Adobe Acrobat Professional, but it crashes whenever I try to change the pencil colour from red. The free Adobe program seems to just do signatures, not general markup. I just downloaded a trial of PDF Expert and it seems to work well."
255,Someone in this thread suggested importing the PDF into OneNote. So far it is working better than the other solutions I've tried. I haven't tried PDF Expert.
256,"We are using an OWL 360-view camera set up with Canvas conferences.  There are Wacom boards placed in some of the classrooms and I've tried using Microsoft Whiteboard with it and it's been the best option in my opinion; I have similar opinions as to what you've mentioned.  You can upload PDF's of slides, but it arranges them all on a grid so you have to zoom in to access any one slide that you want to annotate.  That's the frustrating part of MS Whiteboard."
257,OneNote. And just use microsoft class notebook. You are welcome.
258,Have you tried GoodNotes?
259,Be aware of my other reply to the post where i write about xournal++.  New website of them https://xournalpp.github.io/
260,"It's built into Preview, it's just called 'Manage Signature' - in signature mode, you can write freehand on the trackpad."
261,Have you tried Kami? My kid’s math teacher is using it for virtual learning. She posts pdf worksheets that the kids can modify and submit back to her. The interface looks like it has the typical annotation tools. Maybe it would work for you?
262,GoodNotes.
263,"Did you hear of xournal++ ? Its free software and avaiable also for MacOS  https://xournalpp.github.io/  Thats the new site, so for more information you could use their github page as described in the link:)  I want to mention, that i use xournal++ with two graphic tables (one from XP Pen and one Wacom) with Windows and with GNU/Linux it works just great. But i never tried xournal++ with MacOS. Simply because i dont have a Mac yet :)"
264,"Notability.. one time purchase unlike good notes. With good notes, you have to pay when their next version comes out"
265,Drawboard PDF
266,"I use the app Microsoft Office Lens to scan paper notes my professor gives me and convert the PDF into a word doc. I then type up additional notes digitally. I know this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, but They have a bunch of options so you might want to take a look to see if something will work for you."
267,"If you are on Windows, try PDF XChange Editor. Free version has quite a lot of editing features. I absolutely love it! For android - xodo pdf"
268,"First of all: Yes. The Adobe Reader is terrible for your use-case. The software itself is so bloated and unresponsive that I don't even install it on my systems anymore after a fresh install.  The good news is, though: You have several choices, depending on your budget and the amount of features you want to use.  --- My personal preference: [PDF Annotator](https://www.pdfannotator.com/en/) is the ""swiss army knife"": many features, highly customizable, but the license is quite expensive for normal end-users: 70€ (normal price) or 40€ for student (discount) licenses. Back when I went to university, I bought that software with the student discount and not once regretted it. It truly is some great piece of software, if you want or need a lot of features. Besides the pen-input itself (for highlighting/annotations), it has some nifty features like adding blank pages as a work-sheet for you to draw on, rotating single pages or merging/adding/removing single pages or whole documents. I've been regularly using PDF annotator to just merge several PDF documents into one file because it's so handy in that regard.  BUT - there's two potential downsides to that software:  1) With a heavy amount of features also comes some ""bloat"": Compared to other light-weight applications (like Sumatra or Foxit Reader), PDF Annotator feels quite ""slow"". Due to this I'm only using it when I know that I'll need to annotate (or otherwise edit) something in a PDF. If I only want to read stuff, the ""faster"" PDF apps are my go-to.  2) You need to be aware about their pricing model before you buy. I was quite upset when I was faced with their price-model for major upgrades (e.g. when there's big version changes, jumping from v5 to v6).  I bought PDF Annotator Version 4 back in 2013, upgraded it once to version 5 (for free during the first 2 years if you have the ""upgrade assurance"") and have been using it since.  BUT: If I wanted to upgrade to the newest Version now (v7), I'd have to shell out another 50€, which honestly sucks. The ""Upgrade Assurance"" for 'free' upgrades makes it a bit cheaper (17,50€ per year), but it's still... not ideal.  I totally get that developing niche-software is expensive, but that's a lot of money for a software upgrade and in some cases almost prohibitively expensive for some students.  --- [Xodo](https://www.xodo.com/) PDF is more light-weight and also free for personal use. If you don't need a lot of features, Xodo should be alright for working with a stylus.  [Drawboard PDF](https://www.drawboard.com/) emphasizes the workflow with a pen/stylus within PDF files. It was a one-time purchase once, but recently they went with a ""PRO"" subscription model (24,99€/year) on top of that. Haven't used the pro features before, so I can't really give a recommendation for those, but it's definitely on the cheaper end of ""feature rich"" PDF-annotation-software.  ---  If you need more than a simple PDF editor, you might want to take a look at the feature-set of [Qiqqa](http://www.qiqqa.com/About/Features) (open source). It's a research/reference manager similar to Mendeley/Zotero, but has an inbuilt pdf viewer with editing/annotation capabilities.   I don't know how solid the pen-support in that software is (especially compared to Drawboard/PDF Annotator) but you might want to give it a try if you can use the additional features of that software. There's some [additional user-reviews for it on AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/qiqqa/).  ---  So yeah, that's my list. I've been trying to stay as ""paperless"" as possible for 10 years now and those are the PDF applications that I'd take a closer look at now. Sadly, most of the other PDF applications are geared towards businesses (and they show in their pricing that they really don't care or bother with ""normal"" end-users)."
269,Update  Xodo doesn't work  It just locks when pressing the pen and when lifting the pen it keep drawing
270,"What system/device are you using? That sounds like the screen doesn't detect your pen lift-off in time (which sometimes happened to me when palm rejection wasn't working properly on my windows tablet, basically forcing me to do a restart).  Since you wrote, I got curious and also gave Xodo another go using a Wacom One with Windows 10: Both the highlight-marker and the colored pens worked flawless for me.  After that I also tried out the pencil annotation function with [Foxit Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxit_Software#Foxit_Reader) (the free version), which worked fine, but I don't really dig their pen-implementation. Seems a tad too basic and clunky for my taste. (It basically shows you the line with a slight delay while you're drawing, then re-draws it completely when you lift off the pen. It works, but feels ""off"".)"
271,"Have you tried using Microsoft Edge? I know it sounds nuts, but their PDF reader is solid."
272,"Have you taken a look at One Note from Microsoft? You can give your students the unfilled pdf and then use One Note to write on it, streaming or recording your session."
273,"Any good pdf reader will have annotation tools. I use PDF X-Change, it works for me. You can probably find a good pdf reader app that allows annotations, for free"
274,"It depenc a bit on what you are looking for if you just want to annotate PDF's you want something different then when you want to take meeting notes or lecture notes. (IMHO)  [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhvjl) (Free)  A full on notebook replacement:  + + Cross device/ Platform sync + + Optimized for the New Surface Pen + + Endless page good when the Notes get longer and not just fill in on the PDF -  - Highlighting dose not stay on text - - Exporting is more difficult since the page dose not stay with standard sizes  [Drawboard PDF](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhwqt) ($9.99 right now on sell for $6.99)  A perfect PDF annotation App.   + + Highlighting stays on the text + + Pages stay in the size of the original document + - Not very many non PDF features + - Not very good for organizing documents and keeping them in one place  [Xodo PDF Reader & Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdjxp4) (Free)  I can not say much about this one since I have not used it yet.   I personally use OneNote to keep my Notes organized, school, work, life. I have Notebooks for everything. Each Semester I make a new notebook for school, each Client has their own notebook, and big projects in life have their own notebook too. (Yes I have a Notebook dedicated to my 2 year old)  I use Drawboard for reading long PDF's and highlighting. I tried using it for note taking in class but I always run out of space. I don't use it for meeting notes either since I sometimes have pictures or web links in them and I find OneNote more useful for that."
275,Xodo is awesome. I use it at work. It's really powerful for a free app.
276,"Drawboard PDF is still the best. OneNote is nice for note-taking and it's free, but it gets messy when you try to save the pdf again. Of course, you can always use Fill & Sign on Adobe Acrobat to annotate PDFs for free."
277,"Xodo is fine but quirky and good for simple stuff, I use it 95% of the time and it's free, so no reason not to try. Drawboard offers more features but is a little more complicated.  Fuck using Onenote for PDFs unless you're particularly masochistic.   They all have different UI's and they are all a pain in the ass for casual use.  The disparate UI issue is an MS problem from 3.1 so no change their. "
278,"You can use OneNote for PDFs, the key is keeping the sections short. If it's under 20-30 pages it'll work great. I usually break textbooks or handouts into chunks."
279,I use Drawboard PDF
280,I don't use wacom for taking notes.  This is just a idea. How about getting those virtual keyboard with handwriting input. And using your wacom to write on that.
281,"I do use my Wacom One for taking notes.  I was too lazy to investigate apps, so I use rather Illustrator CS6 (good for pasting photos and instant tracing too) or our best and worst enemy, Paint. It fits me  Wacom One is intended on everything you can do with a pen and more. It's all about the software you are comfortable with using & tweaked settings. You do you"
282,"Thanks. I went with evernote, there is a small learning curve but i'm overall very satisfied with the quality of my notes :). Way better than my paper notes."
283,"> Any tips guys? Maybe a better software than evernote? Or maybe Wacom one is not intended for what i'm using it for?  Just to make sure, we're talking about this [Wacom One](https://www.wacom.com/en-de/products/pen-displays/wacom-one) with a screen, right? Even if you had the ""One by Wacom"", the previous device that was only a graphic tablet, you'd be perfectly fine - it would just take a bit longer to get a good handwriting down without a screen.  First of all: Your writing will get better the more you're accustomed to writing on a ""slippery"" screen. The beginning looks always messy, but once you've got your hand/eyes-coordination down, it'll work just as fine (or even better) than on dead trees.  Regarding your software choice:  - I gave Evernote a try years ago (I've been using digital handwriting programs since 2010) and was underwhelmed by the amount of features that Evernote had back then. The price they were asking for was too high for the little convenience that Evernote offered - If you're using Windows 10, you might have [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) already installed. Currently the different versions of OneNote are [kinda messy in terms of feature-parity](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-s-the-difference-between-the-onenote-versions-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US), but if you're on Windows, just make sure to download the [OneNote 2016 Desktop Installer](https://www.onenote.com/download). There's also a OneNote app that you can get from the Microsoft store, but that one doesn't have the same back-up features that the ""desktop""-version offers. You can use both in conjunction, but I heavily recommend setting up the ""desktop""-version first, just to make sure that you have local backups of your notes in case the ""sync""-feature shits the bed. - There's also a Microsoft ""garage""-project in development that's called [Journal](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/journal-a-microsoft-garage-project/9n318r854rhh?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). It focuses on digital pen input and has some neat additional ""ink-first"" features like pen gestures.  If you need to write on PDFs and make annotations, I've written down [some recommendations in a previous comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/fiinft/looking_for_a_pdf_reader_that_allows_you_to_write/fkjaznc/). Don't even try to print PDFs into OneNote and write on top of them. It's a recipe for disaster and messed up notes. If you need to write on PDFs, think about a good folder structure, throw your folder-layout into the cloud and use whatever PDF-editing program suits your needs best."
284,Can adobe do epub as well?
285,this one does [Adobe Digital Edition](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html)
286,"Off the top of my head - Adobe Digital Editions, OneNote and Evernote can do this.      All three open PDF & ePub, have syncing and support annotations."
287,"I just tried OneNote. It didn't want to open my ePub file, and the PDF file had to be printed to it and turned into a glorified screenshot. So I could draw on it but couldn't select or search text.  Evernote can embed the PDFs, but I can't seem to use the drawing tool directly on the pdf. All of my drawings end up outside of it.  Haven't tried Digital Editions with the drawing tablet yet."
288,You can use the app named xodo pdf editor it’s quite good and has a ton of features also free
289,"if just writing, most tablets will do fine. An Intuos Pro might be overkill but are a very comfy size.  Whats your budget, the smaller intuos bt tablets are cheap and good for non pro art."
290,"its not really necessary to have a tablet close to the size of your screen. The [Intuos M](https://us-store.wacom.com/Catalog/Pen-Tablets/wacom-intuos/wacom-intuos-m-bt#/undefined1) sounds like in your range.  The intuos Pros start at $380, so youd have to find a used one if you want one of those for under $200."
291,"I would suggest a Medium. I use a Small, but I'm not using it for annotation, just for running the UI and some photo editing. For annotations and notes, a Small might not be big enough to provide room for handwriting.  Don't worry about resolution because the Wacom tablet resolution exceeds the resolution of the display.  Measure your desk to make sure you have room for it in a convenient place. The Large size is truly large...I have no room for it."
292,"Anything without logging: cyberghost, zenmate, expressvpn, mullvad, windscribe.  Cyberghost is also pretty fast so it's what I use, but haven't tested them all"
293,I use Nord and honestly I love it. It’s been almost a year now and I haven’t received any more pesky emails from my internet provider about torrenting. And the speed is great. It also has a killswitch feature like most vpn. I recommend it. 
294,"To be honest I just run a simple anti virus that came with my laptop. As for does it make me more susceptible or not? I’m not sure. I’m sure if you googled it some more you’d find out. I’d like to think the worse thing that could happen is possibly downloading a virus via torrents. But I’ve been doing this a while and have yet to encounter anything on my end. Maybe it’s just luck, or maybe I’m using the right tactics. Either way, Nord is a good vpn that gets too much hate. "
295,Bullet proof leak protection is a feature of air vpn.  It's 100% safe and no way it will leak because it utilizes automatic firewall rules of windows firewall but don't use a third party firewall with it it needs the windows firewall.   Ivacy is somewhat safe too  Pia's network lock failed me sometime sadly  Cyberghost got a great combo of network lock + app Guardian 
296,"Yes, the leak protection of AirVPN's client (""Eddie"") is pretty sophisticated and no provider can touch Air in this matter. Air is ideal for torrenting IMO.  OT:  However, speeds turned out to be a bit disappointing for me; especially the servers in Sweden are painfully slow.  Mullvad yields far better speeds for me, so i am having a hard time making a decision between Air and the Mole. Currently i use both.."
297,">However, speeds turned out to be a bit disappointing for me; especially the servers in Sweden are painfully slow.  on air vpn ? they Guarantee 4mbps per user and there are tons of people using 270 MB \+ 1 guy even uses "" 379.75 Mbit / sec ""  [https://airvpn.org/status/](https://airvpn.org/status/)  Theres only 2 servers near or above 90% usage the one where the guy with 379 Mb is and another one with not so much speed.  you sure it wasnt an issue on your end ? i allways maxed my connection air vpn  Air is freaking awesome if i didnt buy Ivacy Lifetime for like 20 euro i would certainly go for them."
298,"You are right of course. Generally i can max out my 200/20 line with Air, the servers in Sweden are the only ones that go a bit out of line compared to the others. On a bad day i can barely squeeze 30 - 40 MBit out of them. It's a bit weird, i know, and i am certainly complaining on a very high level. Maybe there is a bad routing from Uppsala / Sweden to my place, who knows...    "
299,"Yep, AirVPN is pretty good."
300,Nord and express I have good experience with them . 
301,"Got Nord a few months back, was recommended to me as a good app for Android but I mostly use it on my desktop. I got my CC details leaked and now am extremely paranoid so I'm using an Internet kill switch, which means you can only access the Internet when using the VPN. I think it can be applied to torrenting as well"
302,"You torrent on the box itself, and just download the files via ftp, ssh, http to your home box. Ultraseedbox is a decent provider for around $13 USD. "
303,use tixati to torrent... you can force it to only use your vpn connection... built in kill switch right into the program..
304,"You should check out NrdVPN & PureVPN. I've tried both, and they're really good. [NrdVPN](https://twitter.com/shutflcers/status/999276342515400704) has the best reviews on the web, but [PureVPN](https://twitter.com/shutflcers/status/999276305572139009) has an amazing promotion going on now - $29 for a 1-year subscription."
305,"I decided to go with ExpressVPN, Thanks everyone!"
306,"[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902) is the best VPN now, really. It has the best speeds and most stable connections. Torguard isn't my favourite, it disconnected me from the server quite a lot"
307,"Honestly NordVPN is still king for me, great discounts pretty much all year and very fast."
308,"Agrh Nord are terrible shill much?  Very basic interface, and terrible p2p speeds.  when you click click to the ""fastest server"" they connect you to a 1mbs a sec server, i have a 330 mbs line!  Cost cutting low quality service"
309,"don't know what this other dude is talking about, i've been using nord for a year now and never had an issue"
310,"[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902) is your best bet right now. Torguard used to be ok, but it's just going down with the years, really. With Nord I have wayyy higher speeds and better connections.   I mainly use it for Netflix, movies, torrenting, gaming and basically for everything and everywhere. They have [an offer going right now](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902), too."
311,"I strongly suggest you take a look at cyberghost and Mullvad. There are hundreds of VPN services. I wouldn't necessarily advise someone to give them all a shot. Assuming some VPN services are unsafe, unreliable or malware, your advice would include an unnecessary exposure to risk. The only somewhat reputable [VPN trial](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/NordVPN/) is the one from Nord. Many others are pretty sketchy and shady."
312,"mullvad all I want perspnally. port forwarding, no logs, fast, low price, good rep,"
313,How do you make mullvad fast? Its slowing my internet a lot. Pls help
314,>How do you make mullvad fast? Its slowing my internet a lot. Pls help  Every VPN will slow down your internet - you need to get more data than that.
315,I'm curious what speeds are you getting with mullvad from a heavily seeded torrent? I'm currently using surfshark and I'm getting my full speeds (250 down 25 up are my advertised speeds). I was looking at signing up for mullvad once my subscription expires since surfshark doesn't support portforwarding. But if mullvad doesn't give me all or a big chunk of my current speed it might not be worth switching.
316,A lot of talk about Mullvad. Where would you recommended getting started with it? (aside from downloading it obviously.)
317,">A lot of talk about Mullvad. Where would you recommended getting started with it? (aside from downloading it obviously.)  Proper, unlimited and full port forwarding."
318,i just use wiregaurd with closest server
319,"Mullvad, because nothing beats multiple open port forwarding."
320,"Airvpn, Protonvpn, Mullvad and Ivpn"
321,No logs (so nobody can subpoena your activities)  Independently audited (to make sure no logs is a genuine claim)  Lots of international servers (improved bandwidth and access to media in foreign countries)   OpenVPN (TCP and UDP) and WireGuard  Kill Switch (closes apps that use VPN  if it fails)  Allows torrents (Norton doesn't)  Competitive prices and positive reviews
322,"How does someone ""do your own research"" without including reviews? Are you suggesting that no review sites are credible?   There are dozens of VPN services. Are you advising people to use free trials to assess them all before buying? Assuming some VPN services are unsafe, unreliable or malware, your advice would include an unnecessary exposure to risk.   Independent audits aren't a panacea or guarantee. They are better than no audits and unfounded claims of privacy and security. Are you suggesting that a level playing field exists for all VPNs? I ask because you've implied reviews, word of mouth and audits are redundant.   I'm willing to bet you're using a well known VPN - Mullvad or Top 10 equivalent. You chose it from a limited number of higher profile VPNs with positive reviews and word of mouth."
323,"Cool, because there's a consistency between reviews and popularity. Protonvpn wouldn't be high on search engines if it wasn't for popularity. You've assured yourself that Proton is good and so have a lot of review sites. By extension, it's possible that reputable review sites are positive about other VPNs because they're also good."
324,"This guy is a tool. He himself will use ProtonVPN but then say HMA and Norton VPN is ""basically the same"" as that and will argue with you unecessarily. He pretends no logs VPNs that are reputed with experienced downloaders are somehow the same as HMA because ""you cant verify"" if they dont log. HMA says they log! But dont waste your breath with this guy, he will keep arguing with you and creating disinfo. Nobody recommending VPNs to new users here say that VPNs are a 1 stop solution or you should trust them explictly, and recommend doing due dilligence before making any yearly commitments."
325,"A quick question, what is your opinion on ExpressVPN?"
326,I purchased both ProtonVPN (Basic) and Windscribe (Pro).  I could not even use Windscribe VPN service since bandwidth was very low. I asked for refund but they didnt refund it.  Bandwidth while using ProtonVPN is very high. I didn't have any trouble while using ProtonVPN (Basic). Software provided to use their service is also very decent compared to Windscribe.
327,"NordVPN -  &#x200B;   No Logs, Nordlynx (for Speed), Tons of Servers around the World, Kill Switch etc"
328,Nord has been caught multiple times leaking data.
329,"You are so full of BS man. I have done multiple tests with NordVPN and not only found a speed improvement, but no DNS leaks , no logging, Kill Switch works perfect. Stop being a troll and an A$$HOLE!  &#x200B;  NordVPN is a great provider!  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Prove me wrong! Lets see where you get your sources from about data leaks."
330,That has to do with their payment system has nothing to do with the app dumb ass.  Prove to me that users have been compromised using NordVPN then I may listen to you. For now I say Nord is one of the best VPN's around.
331,"Mullvad or PIA as others have constantly repeated, but yes [this best deal](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/NordVPN/) from nord is what i would personally recommend.."
332,"Till now I have used lots of VPNs like CyberGhost, TunnelBear, etc. but none of them was able to provide satisfactory results while doing torrenting. But recently I switched to ExpressVPN and the results were really satisfactory. It helped me to share file torrent with other with the maximum protection and fast speed. For torrents, I would strongly suggest all of you go with ExpressVPN."
333,"How would you rank expressvpn, mullvad, and cyberghost? I want it mainly to torrent, stream, and surf. I was on nordvpn before but I was not that impressed."
334,I would suggest you to go with ExpressVPN. It is one of the best VPN currently available in the market.
335,Take a look at nord's trial before anything else honestly. That or mullvad.
336,"Nord is a great all around   But not for torrenting, lots of people still get copywrite warning from their service provide ""cut it out or go to jail'  Cyberghost is made for torrenting, not that I'm encouraging anything. Small disadvantage in speed, but it's better than going to prison"
337,Give [NordVPN a look](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/NordVPN/). It's the best overall for these sort of things.
338,Mullvad or Windscribe. Nothing else comes close.
339,AirVPN old but gold
340,nordVPN has specialty servers for P2P.
341,Nord is a data collection agency.
342,"1. I use Windscribe, researched it and it is solid.   2. You can use the search bars on this or the r/piracy sub to search those VPNs for more info any time.  3. You also can research them on torrentfreak.com  They both have outstanding records in court for not keeping user info. If they don't keep records, there's nothing to give law enforcement if they come knocking."
343,Like I said. I'm not a librarian. Do your own research and don't be lazy. Nord is used by a lot of people whop know nothing and don;t care because they do massive advertising. They are very dangerous for torrenters. I know it to be true. Believe what YOU want. I don't really care.
344,"Windscribe, mullvad, oVPN"
345,"AirVPN, Windscribe, Mullavad."
346,Go to torrentfreak and check their VPN lists.
347,"With torrents your main concern is getting a copyright infringement notice.  It comes in the mail and yes ...  I had two with windscribe :'(   Nord is probably good, but I prefer cyberghost because they don't have one centralized login. That would make it easy to tie activity to an account in an SQL table"
348,"I will recommend to NordVPN, AirVPN, Mullvad or Windscribe for torrenting. There have many VPNs on the internet. So, I will suggest you must compare the [best VPN for torrenting](http://bestvpnchoice.wordpress.com/2021/09/30/best-vpn-for-torrenting/)."
349,"I used [Nord's trial](https://www.synthesizerguide.com/nordVPN/) and never went back to anything else. Although for torrenting specifically, you got a couple of other decent options. My personal faves include:  Torguard  Cyberghost  ExpressVPN  There are a lot of options to choose from. Just do a little but of research on reviews for each vpn to know the best one for your circumstances."
350,here's the best ones IMHO:  * tunnelbear * expressvpn * mullvad * torguard  torguard is litterally designed for torrenting
351,NordVPN got good speeds but not being able to seed with them witch sucks....
352,tunnelbear is faster and with them you can plant your seed
353,I use Nord. Have absolutely no issue seeding.
354,"Nord does not have a feature for forwarded ports. your ""seeding"" is NOT what you think it is. BT clients need an opened port."
355,Well I can 100% say I am seeding using Nord. I can see it being counted towards my ratio on private tracker.
356,surfshark really tickles my pickle both for streaming and for torrenting
357,What about IPVanish? There's currently a special for $48/year.
358,Mullvad
359,I have been using smartdnsproxy for few months now and it works very well.
360,I've used ExpressVPN and PIA and they are both fine.
361,RapidVPN Switzerland server is what I use for torrent
362,Mullvad and Windscribe are both great options.
363,Windscribe is slower than other vpns. Look for threads on reddit
364,-	Celo VPN (offer port forwarding) -	Mullvad -	AirVPN -	ExpressVPN
365,WindScribe and PIA
366,PIA
367,Coldstone's Cake Batter ice cream. ...Am I fired now?
368,"I could, and I would, but then I'd feel pretty bad about my life.

Yep...FML."
369,What's Love Potion?
370,Love Potion is white chocolate flavored ice cream with a raspberry ice cream ribbon and raspberry-filled chocolate hearts. (The Valentines flavor!)
371,"As a former baskin Robbins employee, I used to hate scraping the tubs at the end of the night. What is your least favorite task? Also.... German Chocolate Cake needs a comeback..."
372,"Ugh, someone that finally understands me. Scraping tubs is probably my least favorite thing too, next to interacting with all the people....... I also hate when an ice cream is particularly hard to scoop and someone orders something that requires like ten scoops. Some of my tears may have gotten into their triple large milkshake. German Chocolate Cake is currently available in pre-packed quarts! (In my store, at least.)   Just to add, two of my biggest pet peeves are when either  a) people tap on the glass to get my attention while I'm scooping like I'm an animal in a zoo b) people ask me questions like, ""What does strawberry taste like?"""
373,".... I know how I'm spending my Tax Return. My Local Baskin Robbins is about the feel the wrath of a man who really wants German Chocolate Cake Ice Cream. I used to really get mad when someone would walk in, say they were feeling daring, Try like 6 different flavors...then get regular Chocolate or Vanilla. What's your Favorite way to get ice cream? Mine's Mint Chocolate Chip in a Dipped Waffle Cone. Or A Butter Pecan on a Cake Cone. "
374,Butter Pecan is Underrated.  Awareness must be brought to the people.
375,"I got some sort of smoothie at a BR some time back, took one sip and knew something was off. My girlfriend tried it too and agreed it tasted kind of fermented. We told the girl who made it and she lifted the little lid on the chiller container with peaches in it and got a really disgusted look on her face and called her manager, who got an equally disgusted and embarrassed look on her face. They offered me different one but I asked for a refund instead because I was starting to feel Ill.  How often does stuff like this happen?  Edit: Also, what the fuck did I probably eat?"
376,"It's never happened to me or in my presence. A big part of my job is constantly restocking products that are perishable, or rotating products so that the older things are used before they expire. It's not hard to keep ingredients fresh!  That sounds pretty gross though... Now don't everybody rush down to BR for a smoothie at once!"
377,When is the Shrek 2 sherbet going to come back? The one with the pop rocks. That was the best.
378,"I have tried all of them! And there are actually 36 flavors. Ice creams had to be made according to modern allergens, (dairy free, gluten free, nut free, etc.) so the 31 Flavors isn't so true anymore.   My top three have to be: 1. Snickers 2. Nutty Coconut  3. Love Potion No. 31 but I love Butter Pecan and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (too many choices!). "
379,"I love the Snickers and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. But Strawberry is my favorite forever. Still, you have great taste!"
380,"I LOVE BASKIN' ROBBINS. That being said, do you know the recipes of the flavors? And what's the least ordered item on your menu?"
381,I know nothing of the actual recipes besides the basic ingredients (essentially the flavor) of the ice creams and the allergen info. The least ordered items are probably the sherbet freezes. They're basically melty otter pops in a cup. 
382,I used to work at Baskin Robbins... I used to troll customers into trying the Black Walnut flavor.. damn that was fun.  ANYWAYS.. did you do the same? Are there any flavors that you like to troll customers into trying?
383,Whens Daiquiri ice making a comeback?
384,Daquiri ice is alive and well and has been for sale for a long time now!
385,You should carry peppermint all year long. It's awesome. 
386,"If I had a dollar for every time someone has said that! I have to give it to BR though, they sure found a way to bring people in during freezing weather."
387,"Sure, let me give Baskin a call."
388,"If you like chocolate, try World Class Chocolate, Gold Medal Ribbon, or Snickers! If you're less of a chocolate person, try the Butter Pecan or Nutty Coconut!"
389,1- Mint chocolate chip  2- Pralines and Cream
390,Praline and cream
391,Mint chocolate chip
392,"Subjectively speaking, I find Haägen-Dasz is better than BR.  Cold Stones is good too but I still prefer Haägen-Dasz."
393,Rainbow Sherbet
394,Jamocha almond
395,"anyone else? Gharissa Icecream’s? Got to try them only recently, found it to be thick, rich & true to it’s flavor.   and, yes, Haägen-Dasz over Baskin Robbins.  If we talking Baskin Robbins, honestly, just go for any icecream in the ‘shades’ of brown and get a good pump of those hot butterscotch sauce, some nuts and the cherries that taste similar to🪳. The butterscotch is the main element, atleast to me."
396,I like carre four lemon sherbet
397,Chocolate mousse
398,Jammin Jamocha World class chocolate
399,Pralines Cream
400,"Mado, I love Turkish ice cream!"
401,"For me, strawberry! Really good too with milkshakes!"
402,I concur. That and strawberry cheesecake 
403,Ben and Jerrys mint chocolate chunk is seriously the best.
404,Fuckin worst flavor. Almost as bad as tiger but different strokes for different folks...
405,Butter Pecan.
406,Butter pecan is far superior to chocolate. Prepare for destruction. 
407,Good old vanilla. You can always customize it as per your choosing but vanilla is a really good base. 
408,Heck yeah. Team vanilla all the way!
409,Cookie 'n Cream.  The kind with Oreos.
410,Salted caramel 
411,Pistachio Ice cream. Tbh I don't think it tastes like pistachio at all but the flavor is addictive!

432,"Turkey Hill has this ice cream called double dunker. It is love, it is life. If it were a man or woman I would gladly make sweet sensual love to it to the calming sounds of Barry Manelow. It has coffee flavored ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough chunks and Oreo mother fucking swirl. If you haven't tried it start living. Get a pallet. Then go out into the world and be forever known as the guy who fucks because you'll have a grin the size of Texas on your face and you probably won't be able to walk straight afterwards. Welcome to manhood, Shirley"

461,Kleenex and Puffs are fine for me. I only need to blow on a tissue once or twice. It is not being saved like a handkerchief. I would rather it be soft than scratchy is all.
462,"Puffs suck. They have a tendency to leave behind fluff. Kleenex. Plain Kleenex. No softeners, moisturizer, medication.   Just plain Kleenex."
463,You can buy Tempo on Amazon.
464,The lotion and extra soft versions of kleenex and puffs are pretty good.
465,"I bought these German tissues at a clearance store (similar to TJ Maxx) and they were very thick. They were similar in texture to the fancier kind of paper napkin. Its not like anything that's sold in the US as a tissue.   OP, try these: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vanity-Fair-White-Paper-Napkins-100-Pack-35501/303197716](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Vanity-Fair-White-Paper-Napkins-100-Pack-35501/303197716)  The brand should be available almost anywhere -- Target, a big grocery store, Wal-Mart, and as linked, Home Depot."
466,"It sounds weird but get the Charmin Ultra Soft toilet paper. I always use that instead of tissues when at home, it’s much better imo."
467,Have you tried Puffs Plus? Kleenex are pretty thin.
468,I had no idea American tissues sucked :(
469,A nose in need needs Puffs Plus indeed! I buy the boxes in bulk every spring. Otherwise my nose gets raw and painful.
470,Search 'Kleenex UK' on Amazon and pay $20 shipping
471,The Anglepoise is a design classic. Designed by a automobile engineer who spent his life designing car suspensions. 
472,"I have a $7 one from Ikea, I'd rather buy a new one every time it dies...which is not that often."
473,"I have the same IKEA one, can definitely recommend it. Lost some springyness after a while but the simple design made it easy to just tighten the springs so now it's all good. Attaches to a wall, desk, etc. Can be screwed in or clipped on an edge. Flexibility = awesome!"
474,A simple [banker's lamp](http://imgur.com/6UQBx) has served me well for about 20 years with no sign of slowing down.
475,"The [Tolomeo Table Lamp](http://www.ylighting.com/art-tol-cl-led.html) by Artemide (pronounced Ahr-tim-mid-dee) is seen in almost every movie. Here it is on the desk at [NCIS](http://i.imgur.com/u2LNa.png) (pronounced Cee-ess-eye-rip-off). It is beautifully balanced, pivots and can extend pretty much to full length without tipping over or needing to clamp to the desk. This allows you to use it as a task lamp with a compact head that won't obstruct your work, or can be brought up to full height to work as a flood. There is a similar lamp at Ikea called the [Husvik](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70140257/) but I cannot vouch for its quality. The Tolomeo has won multiple awards and is in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent design collection."
476,"Z-Bar. It built with LEDs, will actually last for L in BIFL. http://www.amazon.com/Z-Bar-Power-Lamp--Metallic-Generation/dp/B000U6DW5E"
477,"i have the i-Tower, which is a 2-part version of the Z-Bar (which has 3 parts + base), also built by Koncept. It's great, the base is solid and heavy, which i love. 6 LED lights, mine is in daylight but perhaps i will switch to a warm light version. it's plenty bright, which helps because i spend a lot of time reading at work."
478,"I saw a very nice battlestation with one of these lamps, but google does not tell me where I can buy one or find the price. Do you know by any chance?"
479,"I have the Jansjo (the first one) and it's a piece of garbage. A desk clamping one like you linked would be great, although I wish it came in black to satisfy my OCD :P  I'll make a trip to IKEA next time I can."
480,"Funny you say that, I had the Janso one first, too.  It sucked ass.  The power supply burned out pretty quick.   The clamp one I got is perfect."
481,"I had a TERTIAL for a couple years, the bits that hold the ends of springs are made of very cheap plastic looking material. 4 of them on mine cracked and broken off spontaneously under the tension of the springs. Unless they fixed this quality control issue in recent years, I wouldn't recommend it. "
482,"That's too bad. I've had two tertials for 12 years, and they're still going strong. I just tighten the screws every few years. I guess it shouldn't surprise me that quality has gone down. "
483,A Dazor model 1000 like this: http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/1/2/8/1/1/4/webimg/489608552_tp.jpg  They go for around 40-75 on ebay and many are well over 50 years old.  Very heavy and high quality and made in USA.  There are several other types of Dazors that are clip on that also look very nice.
484,"Planet makes durable desk lamps, pretty standard looking and a touch of a collectors item but they're fucking good."
485,"Electrix makes [very well-regarded desk lights.](http://www.electrixtask.com/office_task_main.htm)  And they make them in the US!  They are pretty pricey (compared to your average Wal-Mart or Ikea lamp,) but most of them will last for as long as you will, provided you don't abuse them (gentle adjustments, don't carry them by hinged parts, etc.)  I wouldn't say the gooseneck designs are BIFL, but the spring-arm ones should be (although you might need to replace the spring after a while.)  I think everything carries a 3-year warranty, but I'm not 100% sure.  Most of the things I saw do.  Electrix also sells replacement parts too if you do need to fix something."
486,"I picked up a nice classic Dazor desk lamp at Goodwill the other day.  It's similar to the [2-tube fluorescent](http://www.dazor.com/2&3_Tube_Fluorescents.html) shown on their page, with the heavy ""desk base"", and the photos there really don't do it justice. It has much longer arm segments than most task lights you'll find on the market, and the base is *heavy*.  (It's full of cast pot metal of some sort, at least 5-10 lbs of it.)  The nice part is that you can easily get various color temperature bulbs for it, and even combine 2 of them if you want an intermediate temperature.  I have daylight bulbs in mine, which some people find very cool, but you could easily get a lower-temp bulb if that's what you prefer.  Whole thing cost me $10 plus another $2 to fix the sketchy plug.  Made in the USA, definitely looks like it'll last forever.  I'd certainly encourage anyone to keep their eyes open for one, and nab it if the opportunity arises."
487,"More monitors! Basically the same thing :D  Though in all seriousness I have a lamp from tau tronics and love it. Not a classic architect lamp exactly, but it is just as adjustable, you can change the light to be more warm or cool (the warm light is nice at night when winding down since it's not as harsh, the cool light is nice when I'm working on other projects at me desk), it's dimmable, and most importantly to me it doesn't look out of place at a computer. My version is built really well too, nothing feels flimsy or cheap. The exact version I have seems to no longer be on Amazon, but I'm pretty sure this the successor to it:   https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0197ZOAKE/"
488,I just got my wife a Himalayan Salt Lamp if thats your thing :o
489,I want to but my Samsung monitor doesn't have the mount points for them. Was thinking about selling my current setup to get two Asus monitors that I could mount. 
490,"Are you certain it doesn't have mount points? I had to take off this plastic cover on mine to see where they mount.  Also, Monoprice.com for really cheap and great quality ones."
491,"Go to Ikea, buy a LACK shelf and then use the metal ""feet"" they sell for cabinets to make stands. They come in 3 sizes. I made 2 for my last office and I took em home when I left the job. They give you so much space."
492,"Read up on Lifehacker about standing desks, there is a lot against them although I know they were all the rave a few years ago and at my last office a ton of people got them. They can be bad for you, just research it a bit.  I'd say make a nice desk with a great chair and make sure to take frequent breaks :)"
493,"I have a Humanscale Diffrient that I got on eBay for $100, it looks like [they still have some more](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Diffrient-Task-Light-ll-desklamp-by-Humanscale-/130517551693?pt=US_Desks_and_Home_Office_Furniture&hash=item1e6373ca4d).  Humanscale makes a desk clamp, but I haven't found one for cheap.  I think that it [looks pretty good on my desk](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadtillekeratne/8441897395/in/photostream/)."
494,"My roommate last year had this fucking rad desk lamp. I wish I had one too. It's basically a lamp that keeps the light where it should be, it doesn't light up the room at all, just the desk.   EDIT: My roommate had what OP posted."
495,Butter Pecan as far as traditional flavors go but Phish food by Ben and Jerrys is better.
496,"I was expecting to have to ctrl-f to find the correct answer, Butter Pecan. I am so happy right now and proud of Reddit"
497,I came here just to make sure Phish Food was at the top of the list. That flavour is life-changing. 
498,"I had Butter Almond once at a place in Denver, I will never go back to pecans"
499,"Just tried Phish Food for the first time last night, can confirm "
500,"As far as I know you can still get Dole whip at Disneyland, though it’s been a while since I’ve been there so I’m not positive."
501,"You can get Dole Whip at both Disney Land and Disney World. But, as an added bonus, if you go to the Polynesian resort at Disney World, you can get a adult version with booze. "
502,They also serve this in Animal Kingdom now. Dole whip with your choice of light or dark rum.
503,"Bluebell Cookie Two Step.  It's a mix of cookies & cream and cookie dough... it's the best. However, it's almost ALWAYS sold out at my grocery stores :("
504,"OMG blue Bell ice cream. Im vocal about my strong opinions on ice cream (it's my kryptonite) and about 10 years ago I was in Texas training for a job driving in the remote areas between Austin and Houston.  Randomly, my trainer asked me if I've ever had Blue Bell ice cream. I said no and mumbled some rebuttal on how my Yankee ass (WNY represent!) is very aware that Ben and Jerry's has the lockdown on good readily available ice cream. My trainer pulled over and ran into a gas station to return with two small individual tubs of blue bell, vanilla of course, so you can focus on the foundation of what these crazy ass texans THINK they know about what makes a good cold dairy product. I pulled back the lid and shoved that wooden tongue depressor in there and tried a bite. Damn, I still remember that day. Ben and Jerry's was dethroned as my grocery store go to. It was Been and Jerry's to me now. I sulked back to yankeeland, tail between my legs dreaming of when I might be able to travel South enough and cross the Mason Dixon line to the land of milk and honey and whatever else blue Bell puts in there. I confide to my wife about this discovery and moan every few months. God bless her, she tried but she never did understand that blue bunny ice cream is not blue Bell. Thankfully, I finally moved out of that second rate ice cream area and down to the good ol South. Grits are on the menu and I graduated to a DAMN Yankee. After getting a hankering I go down to the local grocery and start looking. Not at that one, go to another.. Nope. Go to the website and find out that my sorry ass moved to a rural damn area outside of their distributed zone. So I vow, one of these days I'm just going to get in the car and drive until I can go to a H.E.B. and pick up a case of shiner Bock and give myself diabetes by way of fucking ice cream."
505,"That was beautiful. As a native Texan, I am much more appreciative of my readily available Blue Bell after reading your story. The only thing that happened to me was when they had to recall all their ice cream for some health issues. People lost it and the moment the ice cream came back on store shelves they were bought up so fast. Shiner is also great, I really like the light blonde!"
506,"blue bell, a shiner and a porch. that's really all you need."
507,My favorite is just plain blue bell vanilla or cookie dough but I definitely need to try this. 
508,"Whelp, I know what I'm grabbing from HEB tomorrow. "
509,All blue bell was recalled for a while due to listeria to be fair.
510,Omg yesssss. My bf is from Italy and one time he took me to an authentic gelato place owned by Italians and we got stracciatella and hazelnut and it was sooooo good. 
511,Moose Tracks
512,Extreme Moose Tracks. 
513,"Went to America when I was 13, still haven't found an ice cream even in the same league. Omg Moose tracks. Yes. "
514,Chocolate moose tracks
515,Ben and Jerry's #1 selling flavor is Half Baked. It is also my favorite and can't believe not mentioned yet.
516,"yes half baked is amazing, it seems you either get cookie dough or fudge brownie in every bite. also s'mores is really good from them too"
517,I'd say that phish food is slightly better but half baked is also very good
518,Home made vanilla.   I'm a boring person. 
519,"Do not apologize. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world. It's made from the fruit of an orchid indigenous to Mexico. Natural pollinators don't live anywhere else, so every commercial flower is pollinated by hand using a technique developed by an ingenious 12-year-old. The pods are picked by hand at the peak of ripeness, processed, dried, bundled, aged for months, and finally combined with fresh eggs, milk, and pure white sugar, churned and frozen using technology which was invented just in time to take advantage of the marvelous new flavor. Every bite of vanilla is a journey across three continents and a testament to ingenuity."
520,"I read a Doomsday prep guide that said to stock up on saffron, vanilla and cinnamon as they will be extremely valuable commodities in a post-international-trade market. I found it interesting, but can't really imagine that I personally would ever accept it in trade for anything valuable (gas, guns/bullets, canned goods, etc)"
521,"I don't use it currently, I just know it's rare. Now if you had a case of chef boyardee cans..."
522,"People were certainly willing to pay a lot for spices in the past, and they made a lot of people wealthy and powerful...I've heard that one supposed reason that spices were so valuable was that in a world without refrigeration, people tended to eat a lot of meat that would be considered rotten by modern standards, so having spices to cover up the taste was a pretty desirable thing.    Now me, if I'm thinking about what would be good to stock up on for barter in a post-industrial society, I'm going to go with drugs.  Or even better, the equipment and precursors to make them.  Stuff like antibiotics and opiates would be incredibly valuable.  Even something basic like Imodium could be life-or-death in some circumstances.  If we're talking apocalyptic wasteland levels of societal breakdown, stimulants like meth or even caffeine would be pretty valuable too.  "
523,"Hm... Stock fake cinnamon, fake saffron and fake vanilla, they are cheap. If you want to get influence the real shit is better, the Saudi Arabia king will contact you for real saffron in the Doomsday."
524,Vanilla bean is the shit!
525,"I ended up getting my wisdom teeth taken out this year and ate a ton of ice cream. I've always preferred vanilla but was convinced I wouldn't be eating mostly soft-solids and liquids for long so I just bought small containers of vanilla. I ended up going through a bunch of brands, most of whom had several types of vanilla each and I found my favorite one of all time. It's Your Churn - Vanilla Bean. If I ever get to choose my last meal for whatever reason, it will consist solely of that fucking ice cream."
526,"But there's also fake vanilla that gets extracted out of wood (correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure that it was wood)  Edit: vanillin (at least it's called that in German) can be extracted out of wood and even be made with cow manure.. At least a scientist in Japan managed to do it, it even requires less energy to get the aroma extracted out of three than it does to get it out of wood. So yeah.. the ""all natural"" on your vanilla icecream is true, but it doesn't have to be actual vanilla. "
527,"I make my own vanilla ice cream and have used vanilla beans from around the world. I buy them online from Beanilla and they are shipped three per test tube. When I got the first batch I was surprised how different they smelled and tasted from each other. For instance, Indian has a rich, chocolate scent while Tahitian is light and smells the most like what we associate with vanilla. There is also vanilla from Madagascar, Mexico, Indonesia, and Tonga. "
528,"Yup! Any type of fruit on top is fair game for me: bananas, blueberries, peaches, hell even canteloupe that is cut in half and used as the bowl. Soo good. "
529,"Vanilla is great and complex. Fuck people who say vanilla is boring, they’re just regurgitating opinions they hear around them"
530,"Have to agree, I like very strong vanilla or vanilla bean. It's so refreshing and cleansing. "
531,"If you like cookies and cream, Ben n Jerry's ""milk and cookies"" flavor is an absolute must try. I didn't think cookies and cream could get any better, and this flavor proved me wrong.  Sucks though, because it doesn't come in a size any larger than a pint, afaik. "
532,"My dude, mint choco chip is where it's at! Coffee chip is also good!"
533,I feel like coffee ice cream in general is underrated. It’s so good! It tastes like it was *meant* to be an ice cream flavor.
534,Mint Oreo is the bomb. 
535,Mint chocolate chip    I'm just some guy I have zero qualifications
536,Mint Oreo though...
537,Pistachio 
538,Pistachio gelato is where it's at.
539,Talenti makes really nice pistachio gelato.
540,Talenti pistachio is delicious. 
541,"If you ever find yourself in NYC or LA (or one of the European cities where they have them), visit Grom.  Their pistachio gelato is astoundingly good.  "
542,im glad this is up on the list becuase even low cost pistachio ice cream is very good. making it yourself with well selected ingredients is a bucket list worthy endeavor 
543,Coffee 110%
544,The Häagen-Dazs brand coffee flavor is the freakin bomb. My favorite ice cream since forever.
545,Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz Buzz!
546,"Coffee flavored ice cream, coffee beans in ice cream, or coffee on ice cream?"
547,I’m going to go with all 3. Coffee on icecream is more frappe but I still love it.  Coffee gelato is where it’s at.
548,"Coffee flavored ice cream, but then you pour an espresso on top of it. (this heavenly experience is called an Affogato)  I make them at the airports on long layovers by buying a scoop of icecream, heading down to starbucks and getting a double espresso, then pouring that over my icecream bowl."
549,"I had ""earl gray tea and cardamom"" ice cream in a trendy shop in Boston.  It was incredible. "
550,Green Tea ice cream is the bomb
551,"I love green tea ice cream. The flavor is relatively subtle, but so pleasing. "
552,Fuck yes. Matcha ice cream is the *SHIT*
553,Mint chocolate chip is the best for me because I love mint and because it's not kinda boring the same way vanilla or chocolate are but it's not over the top like some weird Ben and Jerry's flavors. It's right in that sweet spot with like cookie dough or cookies and cream.
554,"There's one thing I love about mint chocolate chip ice cream which is kind of weird. I forget which brand has the thin rectangular chunks of chocolate in the ice cream but I love taking a bite, spitting out the chocolate pieces, and when I'm done with my ice cream I then have a small hill of vaguely minty chocolate to enjoy.  It's probably the same enjoyment as eating a Rice Krispy treat kernel by kernel"
555,Cheesecake ice cream forever 
556,Black Raspberry / Blackberry. Idk if those two berries are different but they’re both bangers
557,Yup Graeters is famous for their black raspberry chip ice cream. You can get it shipped to you if you don't live in the Cincinnati area. 
558,Kawartha - black raspberry thunder
559,"Yes, black raspberry, not some big corporate brands...the small homemade gourmet creamery's in MA...oh so good!"
560,"They are different. We called them black caps. I didn't know they were raspberries, I just knew they were good. They got ripe just as summer vacation was starting. What a way to start the day!"
561,Ben & Jerry's - The Tonight Dough  CARAMEL & CHOCOLATE ICE CREAMS WITH CHOCOLATE COOKIE SWIRLS & GOBS OF CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH & PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE DOUGH.  
562,"I work at Baskin robbins so this might be heavily biased, but my favorites are love potion, trick Oreo treat, winter white chocolate and cotton candy!"
563,"Cookie Dough, every other answer is wrong"
564,The cookie dough has to be good though. The little cheap bites don’t cut it. Ben and Jerry’s cookie dough is a godsend 
565,"I've never had ben and jerry's cookie dough, is it really that good?"
566,Lavender.   I used to hate the hell out of flower flavored things - made me feel like I was eating soap but one day I decided to go for it and suddenly Lavender Ice Cream has changed my life forever. 
567,Licorice or Oregon Blackberry.  I am ready to be thrown into the fires of Reddit Hell for this.

571,Turkey Hill Mint Choco chip is the best.
572,"Omg the shaved chocolate chips, why do no other major brands do this?????"
573,I had to scroll down pretty far to find the correct answer. To celebrate I am going to eat a Klondyke mint chocolate chip bar.
574,"There's a store near me whose mint chocolate chip is spearmint flavored. To me, it tastes like you're eating toothpaste-flavored ice cream, but my kid loves it and prefers it over the ""traditional"" mint chocolate chip flavor."
575,Mint Chocolate Chip by far! I do love a good Vanilla Bean too
576,Mint Chocolate Chip. No exceptions
577,What is stracciatella?
578,"Imagine Chocolate chip, but the chocolate is drizzled into the ice cream, so it like like elongated drops.  It's a wonderful flavor of gelato (which is not ice cream)."
579,Cherry Garcia
580,Spumoni!
581,I too like old people ice cream flavors. Rum raisin and butter pecan are up there too.

597,Pistachio ice cream made with whole cream and egg yolks.
598,"Tried and true chocolate chip mint.  Or, molasses crinkles cookie doh."
599,"I use mint chocolate chip as my barometer flavor whenever I try out a new ice cream place. At its best it is the most refreshing desert out there.  My favorite place for mint chocolate chip is a dairy farm with an ice creamery on site.  They have the richest, creamiest mint chocolate chip out there and I compare every future cone to that place's."
600,Blueberry cheesecake
601,Vanilla.
602,"Vanilla with just a tad Hersey's syrup.  Then stirred.   Little pools form melt, mix a spoonful of melt with stirred I've cream.   Yes, that whole statement is a flavor."
603,Bittersweet sinphony...coffee ice cream with bittersweet chocolate swirls and chunks. I worked at a restaurant with a very popular seasonal ice cream shop for 12 years. Ice cream is life. 
604,There is a Kroger select brand flavor called brown butter bourbon truffle. It is amazing.
605,Rite Aid's Chocolate Malted Crunch
606,"Damn, so many possible answers. A really good black cherry or black raspberry is the best. But I love shiso leaf and multigrain flavored ice cream too. You can also never go wrong with classics like grasshopper pie/mint chocolate chip and strawberry cheesecake."
607,Butter brickle. It’s ice cream flavored ice cream.

612,Ben n Jerry's chunky monkey. Banana ice cream with chocolate Chunks and walnuts
613,"There's a local ice cream shop near me that makes their own ice cream from scratch and my wallet and waistline have suffered. They have a standard list of daily flavors (chocolate, vanilla, mint chocolate chip, \[local coffee shop\] coffee, etc.), a list of ""daily"" (seasonal) flavors (they've have snickerdoodle (with chunks of snickerdoodle cookie in it!), almond poppy seed, huckleberry, peanut butter and jelly, lavender, and earl gray), and sorbets as well. Usually coconut or fruit flavored, but I don't go for that. Their snickerdoodle and earl gray are fucking amazing. I'm pretty sure they steeped the milk/cream in earl gray leaves before making the ice cream, because there weren't leaves in the scoop I had and I didn't see any in the tub. Their chocolate brownie was pretty bomb too. I think my favorite would be the earl gray though. It was so mild and unassuming, but still rich and delicious.   Side note, lavender should not be an ice cream flavor. It tasted like eating perfume :( "
614,I’m a big fan of Earl Grey tea; I drink it pretty much every day. Found a gelato place on vacation that had an Earl Grey flavor and I can still taste how wonderful it was.
615,Thai Tea
616,Honey butter.   It’s basically vanilla ice cream with peanut butter and honey mixed in. It’s so delish. My local ice cream shop always changes their flavors either every week or every month.

625,Earl Grey  &#x200B;  Samoas  &#x200B;  Hokkaido Soft Vanilla.
626,"Green tea or red bean hands down.  Unfortunately they’re a pain in the ass to find here, so I can’t get them regularly."
627,"Late to the party, but here in Sweden we have a small ice cream maker called Lejonet & Björnen.   Their ice cream are bit pricier, but tastes like heaven. Their ""thing"" is to have whats says on the package in the ice cream.  For example, if it says ""Organic Banana"", the ice cream has real, organic banana in it. And the ice cream isn't yellow, it's brown.    My favorite is Honey and saffron. It's bloody amazing!"

634,You know what? I love vanilla. That shit is delicious and all these orange mocha Frappuccino assholes with their fancy ice cream flavors can go fuck themselves. 
635,"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.  It was always a treat for me, because the one ice cream place in my town growing up has the most fake stupid fucking ass hole bitch fucker cookie dough ice cream there was. It was 'cookie dough flavored'. No chunks of cookie dough, it was a tub of ice cream flavored like cookie dough with chocolate chips. FUCK.THAT.  On the occasion that I got real cookie dough with chunks of heaven in it, I would reach nirvana. "
636,Pistachio

643,"Woo Moose Tracks! Great ice cream. Have you tried the Raspberry moose tracks? I can't remember the exact name but you can get moose tracks which is made with raspberry ice cream instead of vanilla, and it is fantastic."
644,"It's fantastic. As I said I don't know the name exactly, but I've found it in local ice cream shops and it's great.  If you look for the official [Moose Tracks website](http://moosetracks.com/products/moose-tracks-ice-cream/) the also have a Black Raspberry one- not the same as what I'm talking about but probably similar."

661,"Mint oreo. It's just pure awesome, waaaaay better than mint chocolate chip. I don't know why mint chocolate chip is even a thing when mint oreo exists."
662,"This is true. Mint Oreo is delicious but I still just say MCC is my favorite. Though, you're right. Oreo is definitely the clear winner."
663,I just tried Cherry Cordial for the first time like a month ago and I swear I have eaten like two or three gallons of it; I had never tried it before and now I about cum when I eat it because it is so good. Goddamn I love ice cream.
664,OREO!
665,"I can't eat real ice cream, but I can eat the coconut milk kind. My favorite is ""Turtle Trails"" by So Delicious. Has balls of dark chocolate covered toffee in it and caramel swirls and it's really, really good.

674,Nutella. 'Cause that's unhealthy af
675,A flavor called Java Chip that is coffee flavored and has chocolate flakes in it. Yum!
676,"Bubble Gum. I like my ice cream nice and sweet, chocolate and peanuts don't do it for me."

695,Vanilla is my favorite flavor because it is rich and delicious and doesn't need anything else added to be super enjoyable. 
696,"Chocolate. I'm allergic to dairy so there aren't very many flavours I can choose from. But chocolate was definitely my favourite, but unfortunately they only sell Vanilla flavour soya ice cream  where I'm from now so that kinda sucks. "

714,Coffee Ice Cream all the way. I have always said its like eating the smell of coffee.
715,Strawberry Swirl. Two amazing flavors at the same time.
716,rocky road is fucking delicious 
717,Neapolitan - favourite three all in one :)
718,So i used to work at cold stone and you guys need to try this creation of mine . I call it the CBCRC.  CB - Cake Batter Ice Cream C- Caramel R- Reese's Peanut Butter Cups C- Cake. Legit cake mixed in.  Fuse these 4 items together to enjoy the ice cream of the gods.  
719,Mint chocolate chip. It's refreshing and delicious. Plus I crave it every month and it helps me feel less crappy. 
720,MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM IS THE ONE THAT I THINK TASTES THE BEST BECAUSE I THINK IT TASTES THE BEST.
721,"Bi-rite in SF makes some of my favorite commercial ice cream.  Also Blue Bunny in Texas (which is exported to other places) has the best commercial strawberry ice cream I've ever had.  But I like my own best, preferably made with LN2.  Although a friend's goat cheese with fig jam was good. (Better after I added balsamic vinegar to it.)  Bananas Foster yogurt, with burnt sugar and quite rummy boozy thanks to the LN2 hit...  Blueberry lemon yogurt.  Coconut milk with palm sugar.  Sweet cream with blackberries and macadamias (a favorite at ColdStone when they have the components)  Rose petal jam in plain yogurt.  Honey with white sesame brittle.  Forbidden rice and banana."
722,Popsicle. 
723,Anchovy 
724,Not as good as pickle flavor.
725,I love many ice creams but when in doubt cookies n cream
726,Amen if the Ben and Jerry’s chocolate fudge brownie isn’t there and u can’t even find a cookies n cream somewhere head to the nearest sonic/McDonald’s/DQ and get a Oreo whatever at those places problem solved
727,"Ben and Jerry's ""half baked"". It's chocolate-vanilla with cookie dough and brownie... hard to scoop with a spoon but so worth it."
728,"""Half baked"" is also the state in which it's best consumed."
729,"The Tonight Dough is best - caramel and chocolate ice cream with Oreo, chocolate chip cookie dough AND peanut butter cookie dough."
730,"As an employee of my college’s Ben and Jerry’s location who has an opinion on every flavor we have available, I’m gonna have to agree with you on this. Tonight Dough is by far my favorite."
731,"So hard to find most of the time!  Also thumbs up for Cherry Garcia.  I’ve had a craving for about a week, but too scared to venture out in COVID-land."
732,Incorrect. Phish Food is the best.
733,There is a pb half baked that is leagues above the original
734,"You’re so wrong. It’s not even the best Ben and Jerry’s flavor. It looks amazing on paper, and in the store. The flavors really are pretty bland though, not a strong vanilla or chocolate flavor - mostly just sweet. Also, eating it becomes a process of trying to just get that one last chunk, eating the whole thing, and feeling ill.       It’s not a bad flavor, at all. But certainly not the best. Cherry Garcia stomps Half Baked."
735,"You're both either incorrect or spelling ""Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch"" wrong."
736,Vanilla. Real vanilla.  I can’t believe only one person has said this yet.
737,Idk. I feel like I need either vanilla bean or French vanilla.
738,People always get angry with me when I say that vanilla is my favorite
739,"Which quality, authentic vanilla ice cream would you recommend? It’s my fave but I don’t think I’ve ever had the “good” stuff. I’m in the UK if it makes a difference."
740,The best vanilla ice cream I’ve ever had is “Homemade Vanilla” from Blue Bell. It is only sold in the southern US as far as I know but if you ever come on down here you should give it a try!
741,Tillamook.
742,Ye am a vanilla guy too when you ask somebody about their favorite flavor most of people will say chocolate I really hate the chocolate flavor it ruins my day
743,I fucking love chocolate but chocolate ice cream is just... Weird
744,Vanilla is made for ice cream. Chocolate tastes like you're trying to down some tar.
745," Gotta see the show cause then you know the Vertigo is gonna grow, it gets so dangerous you'll have to sign a waiver."
746,Fu*king vanilla. Yyyyyeeeeesssss!!!!!!!!!
747,Definitely vanilla!
748,Cookie dough
749,Have you tried Blue Bell Cookie Two-Step? Cookie dough in cookies and cream ice cream. It will change your life.
750,"And blue bell has *damn* good cookies and cream ice cream.   Cookies Two Step is a national treasure and we always have it in our freezer. When my husband and I first started dating (before this flavor came out) I preferred Cookies and Cream, he preferred Cookie Dough. We always bought one of each. When two-step released I knew it was a fateful sign of our inevitable union from the dairy gods"
751,"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, to be precise."
752,"Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, to be meticulously precise-er."
753,Cookies n creme
754,In my state we have blue bell ice cream. And a couple years ago they came out with cooki two step. It was cookies n cream with chocolate chip cookie dough. It’s literal heaven in a tub.
755,Have you tried Blue Bell cookie dough overload? It's 3 different types of cookie dough and is my new favorite blue bell flavor
756,"> In my state we have blue bell ice cream.   Wait...some states don't have Blue Bell?! Oh you poor, poor innocents who've never lived."
757,Texas
758,"u know how sometimes they'll have strawberry as a flavor, but also strawberry short cake?  I wanna try cookies n creme pie ice cream"
759,"Coffee.   I know, I know, apparently I’m a monster. This has already been explained to me, but thank you for your concern."
760,Haagen Das coffee ice cream fmu
761,"My local ice cream place makes an espresso Oreo ice cream. It's coffee ice cream with chunks of Oreo in it. I don't even like coffee, but that ice cream is to die for.  ...Now I really want some. But I'm sure they're closed. Damn virus!"
762,Coffee Heath Bar Homie.
763,Ben & Jerry’s coffee Heath Bar. Love it
764,Coffee is the best flavor.
765,Mint chocolate chip!!
766,But only Baskin Robbins!  It’s the best.
767,"while the baskin robbins mint chocolate chip is certainly king, I'd argue bluebell's is still good!"
768,I would give you award if I could. baskin robbins mint chocolate chip is the greatest.
769,Moose tracks gang
770,Blue bell - Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough. Red container
771,salted caramel   Fight me.
772,Have you tried the Talenti version? It's amazing
773,Talenti makes the best salted caramel in my opinion. They also make a damn good raspberry cheesecake. Carb and calorie heaven right to your mouth and gut.
774,Chocolate.  But everyone has their preferences. My taste buds hate vanilla and strawberry and pretty much everything else. But chocolate is the best god damn thing ever
775,Hmmmm.... username does not check out.....  But i do agree chocolate is the best! :)
776,Chunky Monkey!
777,Chocolate Fudge Brownie
778,"Very close to my favorite, which the camp I went to named Up Dog (salted caramel IC and brownie batter IC)"
779,Hazelnut!
780,Pistachio
781,pistacchio with stracciatella is always my go-to combination
782,"Try pistachio with cardamom, I've had it at an Afghan restaurant and it instantly changed my favourite flavour of icecream from just pistachio to pistachio and cardamom because of the added richness and depth of flavour."
783,Vanilla is literally the most versed flavor of ice cream. A true stepping stone for all other flavors. Goes with any toppings.
784,"It’s the second most expensive spice behind saffron. It is so ubiquitous it is considered the “standard” flavor. You can go to any shop and you KNOW they’ll have it.   Vanilla is the king, nay, the God of ice cream."
785,I always thought that vanilla was boring and plain . . . but that's because I had only ever known cheap ice cream. Even spending the extra little bit and getting Haagen Dazs over the bulk stuff is a fair step up in terms of quality.
786,Haagen Daas vanilla bean is undeniably amazing
787,French vanilla is where it's at.
788,"Either strawberry or black raspberry.  Can't go wrong with a high-quality vanilla soft serve, though."
789,Chocolate Moose Tracks
790,Rocky Road!
791,That Cake Batter at Cold Stone deeeewd. Or Ben and Jerry’s Half Baked.   Either of those^
792,Good strawberry is absolutely delicious.
793,"Butter Pecan, or Maple Walnut.  Otherwise, Moose Tracks. I know that MT isn't just one flavor, but it's still delicious."
794,Moose tracks is crack.
795,Mint chocolate chip
796,"MCC, Bitches!!"
797,rocky road!
798,Bonus if it's Rite Aid Rocky Road ... 1990s LA college student me considered Rite Aid Rocky Road the apex of good living.
799,Thrifty's for life!
800,*Weird Al intensifies
801,"Ben and Jerry's used to make a flavor called Holy Cannoli, and it was fantastic. I haven't seen it in a long time, though, so it might be retired."
802,"They actually just relaunched a Cannoli flavor, but I believe it's different from Holy Cannoli."
803,Butter Pecan
804,Yes that's my goto flavor of reasonably common ice cream. Used to be my favorite but now Cinnamon Dulce de Leche and Salted Caramel have edged it out. But Butter Pecan on warm apple cobbler is crazy good.
805,"Pistachio slaps, banana does too  Blue moon is quite lovely.  What flavor is blue?  For topping with fruit I'd say vanilla bean.  Mint chocolate's delicious but only when green  &#x200B;  Chocolate explosion is great in small servings  Though three scoops of that can be rather unnerving  But flavor's not all, for the butterfat mix  Makes creamy consistency licks upon licks"
806,Love blue moon. I also like Superman.
807,Coconut (w/ a scoop of chocolate)
808,Lavender honey.
809,Mint chocolate  edit: OKAY mint chocolate CHIP
810, Mint chocolate CHIP bruh.  Put some respect on its name.
811,MINT CHOCOLATE BEST ICE CREAM FLAVOR
812,"Mint, but you can keep the chips tbh. They're always low quality chocolate, and in a milkshake they just clog the straw."
813,Idk I just like chocolate. And I never drank a milkshake
814,"I love me some chocolate, I just don't appreciate low quality chocolate, especially when it's in otherwise quality foods.  I understand that I am in the minority."
815,"I like it when they're flakes instead of chips, like in Baskin Robbins' version. Alden's is even better but harder to find."
816,It's so hard to find just mint ice cream though
817,I feel people are polarized on mint chocolate. I love mint chocolate but no one i know likes it.
818,"Hard to pick just one, but homemade rhubarb ice cream is high up on the top. And to ad some luxury, put some homemade rhubarb jam to it. That is amazing."
819,Mint chocolate chip/cookies and cream. Or mint cookies and cream.
820,A local dairy near me does Amaretto and Black Cherry. It is literally heaven.   Another local one (local to my Mum) does Cola Cube flavour. Weirdly amazing. Up there with the Irn Bru ice cream I had in Lanarkshire.
821,Lemon
822,Haagen Daz lemon sorbet tastes like summer and it's wonderful.
823,Or even lemon curd.
824,"Crystallized ginger. I've only seen it in a few stores, but it's sweet, it's spicy, it has a little bit of crunch, and leaves you with a warm feeling."
825,Some Thai restaurants serve ginger ice cream.
826,Stracciatella
827,Strawberry
828,Tiramisu
829,"I LOVE ROCKY ROAD!!! If anyone gets that reference, we're homies for life.   And if anyone gets THAT second reference, I worship you as my new god."
830,Weird Al is my daddy!
831,"Either Superman or blue moon. And I don’t mean that dyed vanilla Superman, I mean the Midwest Superman that has blue moon as the blue flavor. (Also not blue moon as in the beer)"
832,Haagen-Dazs chocolate peanut butter.
833,"My 3 favorites are Cherry Garcia, Phish Food & Moose tracks"
834,"First mention of cherry garcia is way too far down, insanity!"
835,#*__MINT CHOCOLATE__*
836,Black raspberry chip from Greater’s
837,Chocolate chip mint
838,Tylenol
839,Mint choc chip. I like to add smarties to my ice cream too.
840,Matcha!  And Whiskey Hazelnut
841,MFin' pralines and cream.
842,"Ben and Jerry's used to do a flavour called ""Chubby Hubby"" if memory serves me correctly it was a malt ice cream with peanut butter filled chocolate covered salted pretzels. It was the bomb, sadly gone to the graveyard of flavours now...."
843,"The one you get from mixing Strawberry & Vanilla, I personally like to call it Valentine flavor xD"
844,Chocolate
845,Cotton candy
846,ben and jerry’s chocolate therapy. FIGHT ME
847,Strawberry or pistachio
848,Turkey Hill fudge ripple specifically! It was the brand Angel Food when I was a kid in the 80s - 90s. Turkey Hill bought out.
849,Moose tracks tho 😏😋
850,Vanilla. Sounds lame. But.... you can make it whatever you want with any toppings. Unlimited possibilities.
851,"Cotton candy, no doubts."
852,elderflower sorbet *chefs kiss*
853,Anything from Blue Bell
854,"Top 3: licorice, banana pudding, vanilla w/ maraschino cherries mixed in  Flavor I thought I wouldn't like: Pistachio. I'd never even eaten a pistachio and didn't know what to expect from it. I absolutely love it though.  Strangest flavor: Black sesame was a very new flavor to me, though I realize it's not unusual. So was lavender rose when I first made it. "
855,"Lavender rose ? Tell me more about it.   Never had banana pudding, did you make it? Is it literally pudding in the ice cream?   Is the licorne from your top 3 the black licorice? "
856,"The lavender rose just sounded pretty, and I'd never had floral flavors before. I used [this](https://www.sugarhero.com/lavender-rose-ice-cream/) recipe and tweaked it here and there. It's not bad at all, though my family wasn't as fond of the floral flavor (more for me at least).   The banana pudding is usually made w/ an egg/custard-y vanilla base, some bananas, and Nilla wafers (and topped w/ whipped cream, of course). Dessert puddings are also cream-based and just isn't frozen (and maybe has a few different ingredients/proportions), so in a sense, it is kind of like making the pudding and just putting it into ice cream. Though I think technically, my recipe would've made it banana custard...but whatever. I think most banana pudding recipes I know use eggs in the pudding anyway, though I haven't made it myself.   The licorice one is mainly because black licorice is my favorite candy. Even if it weren't, the flavor of it seems to do well in cold desserts like ice cream. But it's definitely more unusual. I've only had it a couple times since it's very hard to find. I hope to try and make it soon though. "
857,"Black licorice hard to find?  I hate this flavour with passion. Can’t stand it. Hate its smell too. My mother loves it tho.  I think it’s pretty easy to find in Canada/ Quebec.   Banana pudding must be good, I love bananas! I am definitely getting a list of ice cream to try with this post. I will try your lavender recipe for sure! "
858,Chai-Gingersnap was amaaazing 
859,"Goat cheese honey and fig I can figure out what it taste like, and must be amazing. Crème caramel should taste very great too. Thanks for your answer! "
860,"Top 3 in order: Mint Chocolate Chip, Coffee, Vanilla Bean  Flavor I thought I'd hate but loved: Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. I thought that the cookie dough would be too much but it works super well.  Strangest flavor: [We have BBQ ice cream in Kansas City](https://www.kansascity.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/chow-town/article160536829.html). Not for me personally, too much going on."
861,"Wo! Bbq ice cream? And I thought steak chips were strange. At least your tried it.   I can get behind coffee and vanilla beans. I really like these two too.   To make chocolate chip cookie dough, the dough has to be pasteurized? "
862,"Top 3: Anything chocolate based with chocolate flakes, Swiss Orange Chip which is a chocolate orange base, and Vanilla bean.   Most interesting which I really liked: Ube  Strangest flavor: Green Tea, which I hated, tasted like the cream was steeped with grass clippings."
863,"Haha! Never tried green tea, but I can figure out what it tasted like with your description!   I don’t know Swiss orange, but orange and chocolate together is good, so that must be good aswell.  We had a orange ice cream here in Canada when I was younger. It was very good. Tried once to do an orange ice cream. Didn’t taste enough to my taste "
864,"Favorites as an adult: Pistachio, Black Cherry, Mint Chip   Favorites a kid: Tutti Fruiti, Daiquiri Ice, Rainbow Sherbet    The strangest flavor was Tamarind. This was ice cream not a sorbet. I really thought it wouldn't work."
865,"Were you pleased with the tamarind flavour?  I don’t even know what is it, I’ll have to google it.   Never had black cherry. Should have some some.  "
866,"My top 3: Vanilla, Toffee / Butter Crunch, Cake Batter  Most surprising flavor: Matcha  Strangest flavor: Ben and Jerry’s ‘Late Night Snack’, which had potato chips in it"
867,Oh! Damn! Now your talking!  That’s my kind of ice cream! Will look for it!   Matcha must be good!   Cake batter? How?
868,"Chocolate-licorice, almond-caramel, fresh strawberry."
869,"Almond caramel, with piece of almond? Or extract ? "
870,Pieces of roasted almond.
871,Miam!  Thanks!
872,Top 3:  - Coolhaus balsamic fig mascarpone  - Haagen Dazs creme brulee (discontinued; dulche de leche is close but not the same)  - In the 90s Godiva had an amazing white chocolate raspberry ice cream. I’ve tried others but none compare.  Flavor I didn’t think I would like but did: Creamistry has an incredible Capn Crunch flavor. I don’t like Capn Crunch and would have never tried it if they weren’t handing out samples one day. It’s very good.  Weirdest flavor: I thought I would love black sesame but I didn’t like it at all. 
873,"I’ve seen crème brûlé flavour once, can’t remember where it was. Didn’t taste it tho. Will have to try that too, and maybe make it too, crème brûle is my girlfriend favorite dessert.   Capn crunch is interesting too. Not a huge fan of those  too. More a fan of frosted flake  "
874,"**Top 3**: Realistically my top flavors are all acutely associated with a specific memory. So with that caveat 1) Gelato Messina's pomegranate raspberry brownie - I make my own now (of that exact flavor) and it's my favorite ... but dang nab it nothing compares to that memory. 2) Brandy butter, not because it's the most amazing thing ever, but because it is the perfect encapsulation of childhood Christmas memories, at home with my grandmother, when I now live far far away (in another country). Blueberry citrus - from my friendly semi-local ice cream parlor (and so much better than my attempts), and which we had at our wedding!  **Surprisingly good flavor**: I still remember my first lemon ice cream (not sorbet) as a teenager - it was perfect! (I was never really a fan of 'sour' flavors). Separately, red bean paste (so long as it's smooth not crunch).   **Weirdest**: Taro (nope!), and durian (ALL THE NOPE!) - they were entirely appropriate for where I was living at the time, but not really my thing :)"
875,"I have an extract of brandy butter I think. That would be a good thing to try in. Never had this flavour.  Pomegranate gelato brownies must be a hell of a recipe to make ! And blueberry citrus must be refreshing!   We had orange ice cream here when I was younger, than is was not “trendy” anymore and companies stopped making them. Tried once, didn’t taste like the childhood memory!   Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible "
876,"> I have an extract of brandy butter I think  I just half a jar of it in my normal custard base :)   > Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible   I find durian to be not quite so bad as it's reputation, especially because there are different 'types' of durian, which smell to varying degrees. In ice cream the smell was pretty neutral. But the texture had transferred over too, and that was what really got me. I've had awful luck adapting to the texture of a number of southeast asian desserts (ais kacang ... *shudders*)."
877,Dark chocolate with peanut butter is very good. I made one the other day! 
878,cookie milk (vanilla base)
879,Cookie milk? Like milk soaked with cookie ? 
880,"Favorites: cherry garcia without the chocolate chips (I hate chocolate chips and will pick them out! ), yogurt gelato, mint cookie  I can't really think of anything I thought I would hate but loved, I don't really try anything I think will taste bad.  Strangest would definitely be durian. I had a taster out of curiosity but I couldn't get over the gasoline smell/taste. I haven't had actual durian though so it might have just been the ice cream at that shop."
881,"Oh god! Durian?? 😱 I would even think about trying it. Never smelled one, never tasted one.  "
882,"green tea ice cream is very easy to make, you can get matcha powder at an oriental market and just add it to vanilla"
883,Asian market... Orientals are rugs. 
884,I love green tea ice cream.
885,They have similarly powdered black tea that makes another variation of typical ice cream flavor quite nicely. 
886,Cinnamon ice cream is amazing.
887,Cinnamon ice cream and chocolate foam is great.  
888,"I haven't made it myself, but a gelato shop near where I used to live made lavender. It was heavenly. It had a delicate flavor, so you would want to serve it as the main dessert and not mix it with brownies or pie or sauce, but I definitely want to recreate it at home. "
889,We have an ice cream place that makes wild berry lavender and it is yummy. In the summer they make sweet corn and it's also tasty.   http://www.jenis.com/categories/Flavors/ 
890,I wish I lived on the west coast where lavender grows rampant. That sounds divine. 
891,I live in chicago and have a very healthy lavender plant growing in front of my house.  Yields a lot of flowers from which I make a lot of lavender simple syrup every year.  It can be done!
892,I live in south Florida... it's typically too hot for lavender. I've seen some people do it but items takes a lot of work and doesn't last very long.  I always come back from Portland with a huge Ziploc of it though.
893,Lavender grows like crazy in my garden... I think this is going to have to go pretty high up on my list of flavors to try making!
894,"We also have an ice cream place, [Salt & Straw](http://saltandstraw.com/home.php), that makes a honey lavender ice cream, as well as many other unusual yet delicious flavors. Some of my favorites are pear with blue cheese, honey balsamic and cracked-pepper strawberry, and sea salt with caramel ribbons. They also had one this summer that was chevre with marionberry and habanero jam. Mmmmmm."
895,Brown Bread. I go to a place call Scoops in Los Angeles. They're always making unique flavors which change fairly regularly. 
896,"...like Pumpernickel ice cream? I'd eat that. Might be nice with sweet, caramelized onions on top, too.    Don't judge, you know I'm right. ;)"
897,Purple yam.  My fillipino mother in law introduced me to it. It is fucking delicious... AND PURPLE.
898,"Taro? I LOVE taro. To me, it tastes the way chocolate chip cookies smell fresh out of the oven."
899,"Oh Taro is good, my favorite frozen yogurt flavor *by far*. "
900,"I don't know if it's generally called Taro, but in Filipino we call the purple yam ""ube"" (pron. oo-bee)."
901,I wonder where I can get a purple yam.... 
902,i bet it's taro... asian groceries should have them
903,Red Bean Ice cream is quite good
904,...like kidney beans?
905,like azuki beans.
906,"In the red bean ice cream I've had, they're soft beans mashed up a bit- not chunky at all, though. Azuki beans are sweet, so they make a great tasting ice-cream flavor. There are actually a couple Japanese treats that put azuki beans in pastries, sometimes shaped like fish (not sure why, though)."
907,I'm not sure actually. I had it once in a Japanese restaurant and it was delicious. The aftertaste was similar to that of coffee ice cream. 
908,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of a tasso ham ice cream I tried.  Personally, I've had textural difficulties with avocado ice cream due to the high fat content, but it works well if you've got a CryoJet.  As for carrot, I haven't had it, but I see no reason it wouldn't work. You could either go in a carrot cake direction or a maple- or honey-glazed direction. Personally, I think I'd either roast them for a more complex flavor, or juice them and make a sorbet."
909,"Quick google search for CryoJet didn't help me at all. Is this something I need in my life?  The carrot ice cream was one of the first recipes I searched for. It's already sweet, and to roast it or pan fry it before adding it to an ice cream mixture is something that appeals to me. Honey/maple would be nice - but so would caramel. I would eat that.   How did the tasso ham taste?"
910,"Sorry, I meant PacoJet. It's a commercial ice cream machine that takes canisters of frozen solid base and makes perfectly smooth ice cream. Saves a lot of the fiddling home ice cream makers have to do to get the right balance of water, sugar, ice, fat and air. On the minus side, it'll set you back $4,000."
911,"Lol that makes way more sense for me, thanks.   Yea, most certainly am not at the professional level. Got my ice cream maker for free. It's pretty old and didn't have a manual. Doesn't matter because ice cream.  So, the tasso ham?"
912,"The tasso ice cream had a lovely balance of savory and sweet with a touch of smoke and a spicy finish. I don't know you'd recognize it as ham flavor if you weren't told, though. It was served with a hot crawfish pie and the contrasting temperatures and texures worked very well."
913,Garlic - courtesy of the Gilroy garlic festival. Had this when I was a kid. The start of my passion for Garlic in general.  http://americanfood.about.com/od/extremeamericancuisine/r/garlicic.htm
914,I wouldn't have ever imagined.... looks mighty fine. Garlic is beautiful. 
915,I LOVE my recipe for buttered popcorn ice cream. It's delicious when topped with a salted caramel sauce. Mmm.
916,Oh my god it sounds heavenly. I'm a sucker for salty sweet anything.
917,Pisco Sour Ice cream. It's a traditional drink from peru or chile. It's actually xtemly delicius 
918,"Most of the stuff that might be ""weird"" that I've made has been posted, except Pok Pok in Portland has a bourbon coke float, with bourbon ice cream.  I ripped off the recipe.  I make a gelato base with a tsp of vanilla extract.  Once it's cooled I mix in 4 tbsps of bourbon.  I usually use Makers b/c it's sweeter.  And then mix it up.  It's got a nice vanilla/brown sugar/oaky flavor and the coke floats are delicious."
919,"Ok, number 1, Portland, OR is completely badass so that's that.  2, Do you have the recipe? I know that alcohol doesn't freeze so a lot of the recipes just say to add it in towards the end - is that what yours says?"
920,Wasabi... I think it was Sorbet however. Still pretty darn good.
921,"Olive Oil - the amount of fat gives it a wonderful consistency, and it has an incredible mellow taste."
922,"I've made it with [this recipe](http://www.theworldwidegourmet.com/recipes/mirabelle-tarts-olive-oil-sammut/) and it was amazing. Granted, it didn't have a ton of oil, but it's one of my favorite ice creams."
923,I made this [maple ice cream](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/maple-ice-cream-recipe.html) for Thanksgiving and it was terrific.
924,"Favorite weird ones I've made are goat cheese with roasted cherries, and basil with a mint swirl."
925,"i got the goat cheese recipie from the Jenni's Splendid Ice Cream book.  I found several of her recipes available on-line, which thoroughly convinced me to buy the book.  "
926,"Ginger's my favorite ice cream flavor, but i suppose it must be strange because it's impossible to find. I've only seen it at a few places, and then only briefly.   I love a nice garlic ice cream as well. I've tried garlic chocolate ice cream and did not like it, but the just garlic with vanilla is a treat.  Red bean and green tea are so common around here now that I don't think they qualify as strange anymore, but I love them."
927,"I'm in the San Francisco bay area (east bay). There's lots of Japanese restaurants around here that serve red bean or green tea ice cream (sometimes with sweet tempura batter, for a take on the baked alaska). The garlic ice cream was from down in Gilroy.  The first time I had ginger ice cream, though, wasn't in this area. It was at Morimoto's in Philly. It was served on a crisp sesame seed cookie and covered with a tea reduction sauce and slivers of baked lemon grass... tastiest desert I've ever had."
928,"I have yet to go to one of the stranger ice cream places out here. There's one that has candied ginger, which is rather different than just ginger. It has all sorts of strange flavors, though. I'm hoping to get to [Humphry Slocombe](http://www.humphryslocombe.com/Home.html) sometime this month."
929,"Chili lime.  I used to work at a place that a did a trio of ice cream with that one, dark chocolate, and strawberry peach.  It was awesome."
930,Pistachio 
931,"I actually tried fois gras ice cream once. Not something I'd what every day, but it was surprisingly tasty. It also had some kind of berry in it - blackberry maybe? But it was so much better than I would've expected :-)"
932,I have had carrot cake ice cream that was fantastic
933,I like both basil and cilantro ice cream.
934,Avocado Cinnamon
935,"Scallop.  Only had it the once,but it was scrumptious!  Kind of like a mildly sweet, creamy, seafood soup, but cold and in a cone."
936,"Orange pepper; strawberry with pink pepper; black sesame; and buttermilk. I've made basil, but I wasn't a huge fan. "
937,"* sweet potato ice cream * i've also had a scoop of soy powder ice cream filled with [mochi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mochi) (japanese rice paste), which was also delicious."
938,I was thinking of a sweet potato ice cream with some caramel; I'm glad you mentioned it as being good.  Soy powder ice cream. Does that change the consistency at all?
939,"surprisingly, the soy powder ice cream didn't have a different consistency than a standard vanilla hard ice cream.  i have not sampled it in soft serve, though.."
940,"A cooking TV Show here in Denmark, once made a smoked herring ice cream. I wish I could say it came out delicious, but I'm afraid it didn't seem like a big success."
941,"Iron Chef America folks often times try their hands at turkey ice cream, and such, and the judges *never* like it. Shrug. I'll try anything once. Almost. "
942,i'm a sucker for the avocado milk shakes :)
943,"I've never had one, but its about to happen. Gettin me some cado this weekend."
944,"There is a Kabab house near us that makes a heavenly Saffron Ice Cream with rosewater. It's a beautoful golden/saffron color, and the smell- at first- smells like strong roses in spring. I remember the first taste was kinda weird, but I wanted a second taste. Then a third, etc. Now it's one of my favorite ice cream flavors- but only from that restaurant."
945,"Omg saffron! See, I would have never thought of that. Incredible."
946,"I am still not a believer in pork floss ice cream (Taiwan) and green mango sorbet with bagoong (Philippines).  But several years ago, I had spicy flavors and am now a convert.  Sugar balances the heat.    I love strawberry candied jalapeno and thai chili lime (originally inspired from Humphry Slocombe in San Francisco).  Made the former and it's always a surprise hit with everyone."
947,Parmesan with figs.
948,"Olive and Basil.  Effectively basil flavoured with olive chunks mixed in right at the end. Also added some pine nuts for texture which worked really well. The salty olives + sweet icecream worked quite well together, but keep the olive chunks small if you're going to do this... its kinda gross if they're too big.  I think it'd work quite well with caramel in there, as caramel + salt tends to be a good combo."
949,"Have also really enjoyed Star Anise ice cream, but don't consider that quite as strange."
950,"Blue cheese and honey from Sweet Republic in Scottsdale, AZ  "
951,"Not as out there as some others in this thread but we often put a bit of balsamic vinegar in with our strawberry ice cream, it really works."
952,"I'm too lazy/tired to type out the recipe but I created a jamon (as in Serrano, as in fancy ham) gelato for a chocolate dessert not too long ago and it actually did really well. Very umami and Parmesan-like at first, then sweet and milky with a distinct chicharron/crackling finish."
953,I... would really eat that! jamon serrano's awesome. what was your recipe like?
954,Raspberry white tea ice cream has been a favorite for me in the summer. I can't wait until it gets hot so I can make some!
955,"A local place does gorgonzola and pear. And earlier this year I tried blood orange, which was amazing. At the same place I also tried ""fig yoghurt,"" which the person behind the counter insisted was definitely ice cream, not frozen yoghurt! Either way it was the best thing I ever tasted.     Edit: My favourite flavour of all time is rose. Not sure how strange that really is but I had to throw it in there. Earl Grey ice cream is amazing too. I'll stop now."
956,"I currently make Gorgonzola and ricotta gelati for my menu at work. Both have gorgeous textures. [This](http://cafebacaro.blogspot.com/2012/10/gorgonzola-gelato.html) is the Gorgonzola recipe I've been using, and [here](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/11/easy-ricotta-gelato-recipe.html) is the ricotta one. They're both on the softer size, smooth, perfectly scoopable with great clarity of flavor. AND they're both super easy!"
957,Oh wow thank you!  I absolutely love cheese so the gorgonzola is probably going to be my next endeavor.  I really wanted to do a parm one but I couldn't find a good recipe.    I am incredibly grateful for these recipes!  Thank you!
958,"It's in _Perfect Scoop_, so I suppose it's not that weird, but I really enjoyed the orange-szechuan pepper ice cream."
959,I recently had cardamom flavored ice cream and it was to die for!!
960,My favorite unusual combination is a recipe from [Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home](http://www.amazon.com/Jenis-Splendid-Ice-Creams-Home/dp/1579654363/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1398978523&sr=8-8&keywords=ice+cream+recipes): Sweet Corn with Black Raspberries. Sweet and tart and delicious!

962,"I'm the head chef of an artisan gelato company.  I've made thousands of custom flavors.  Today I made Corona Lime Sorbetto, Oberon Orange Zest Gelato, and Guinness Espresso Chip Gelato, and that's just the beer flavors. "
963,"My contract doesn't allow me to reveal recipes.  But I recommend starting with your base recipe, and adding more beer than you think you should.  strong IPA's are my favorite.  We also make an oatmeal stout gelato with homemade oatmeal raisin cookie dough. "
964,"Yesterday I made artichoke gelato from the baby artichoke petals that were just getting thrown out. It's amazing. Clean, delicate and creamy. And naturally artichoke green! Same base as my jamon recipe without the extra milk, infused with a wee bit of lemon zest and vanilla, and blended in a blender since an immersion would choke (ha) on all the fibers. Half a shot of Cynar to finish."
965,"Just found out about [this ice cream place in  Brooklyn, Odd Fellow Ice Cream](http://www.oddfellowsnyc.com/flavors.html). They have had a lot of interesting flavors. I'm definitely inspired after seeing some of these."
966,"Last summer I was playing with a concept for a Jersey sweet corn-white truffle ice cream.  It was right at the end of the season...so this summer, I have pledged to really concentrate on this one...will post up pics when I do...thanks to OP for this amazingly inspirational thread!!!   I am making a caramel ice cream today...will post it later...  "
967,"Absolutely!!! It took a while, but I discovered I need to use truffle honey...pics real soon!!!!! "
968,Oyster ice cream...
969,I made smoked salmon ice cream earlier this week; 'twas damn good imho. 
970,Had ricotta fennel gelato in Italy - ridiculously good
971,"I make the ice cream for all the family gatherings. MY present to the birthday girl/boy is they get to pick the flavor. No matter what they ask for I will make every effort to make it.  So here is the list as best as I can recall of odd flavors.  * Ballerina, my niece dances (Made bubble gum flavor using icing flavor from target) * Beef jerky pie (I ripped up beef jerky and made uncooked cookie dough in balls, freeze the balls first, tasted actually not bad) * Raspberry, cranberry lemonade sherbert (Other niece likes sour) * Pumpkin pie (Used pie filling, and uncooked cookie dough to add pie crust taste)  So always make new things, as I have learned so much from having to make such weird things."
972,Raspberry cran lemon sherb sounds delightful. Well they all do. How does the uncooked cookie dough work with the ice cream?

998,In poland there is an icecream with taste of beer. It tastes completly diffrent from accual beer but hey.
999,Rocky Road.
1000,"in terms of comfort food, I would say that cookies and cream."
1001,Butter pecan or coffee
1002,"Anything with malt powder.   My uncle once took me out and I got a rocky road ice cream malt and suggested I get it with extra malt powder and it was absolutely amazing, and now I wont eat rocky road ice cream unless I have malt powder to put on it."

1012,Phish food by Ben and Jerry's is the best
1013,Homemade vanilla ice cream
1014,Praline. It is kind of like a Nutella flavoured ice cream.
1015,"Vanilla is tops. As it also easily becomes any other flavor. Without it the rest wouldn’t be. But butter pecan, strawberry or peach I would be happy to get over chocolate. Chocolate though if a cheap carton of it will to me taste better than the vanilla from the same brand. Black walnut though was not for me at all."

1052,"Nutella, and you put some Nutella in the ice cream so it hardens to the consistency of fudge"
1053,"I Ana a fan of Gino's on Figueroa. The simpler the pizza, the better here. If you can, get a slice of cheese fresh out of their oven. "
1054,"To be honest, I don't rate it. I'm not a local, but was staying at the Canary, so Gino's was close by. The pizza was nice, but nothing special, the price was fine too."
1055,"Second vote for Gino's, best pizza in town by far. Super cheap too.  Uncle Rocco's (on state) is also good, a bit more expensive but they have $3 draft fig mountain so there's that"
1056,Easily Paesano's on San Andres in the westside
1057,I always forget about Paesano's! That place is really good.
1058,"Olio pizzeria's magherita DOC, no contest.   It's not cheap, but if you want the best, it's the best. "
1059,"Via Vai in upper village montecito has several Italian pizzas I crave on their menu, and if it's delivery obviously Rusty's is the sb staple "
1060,Pizza Guru has some amazing atypical pizzas (goat cheese w/ pesto and buffalo chicken) and do gluten free. I'm more of a simple pizza person in general but the Peaceful Pesto there is amazing and figured they deserved a shout out.
1061,Patxi's on State is really good. It's a deep dish Chicago style pizza. It's pretty pricey but the slices are very filling and they give you fresh honey to put on the crust.
1062,Actual Chicago Style. [Here is a photo of their pizza.](https://patxispizza.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/signature.jpg) 
1063,"In fairness, the 45 minutes is the time to bake the deep dish so it tastes good and fresh.  I was going to recommend it as well but you've visited already.  I can't really think of any other places.    I hear a lot about Olio though.  Haven't been there myself, but I think I'll plan a trip soon. "
1064,"Oh god is it worth it though. You can get 2 shitty pizzas from Dominos for $17 delivered in 18 minutes, or an amazing, authentic, and filling deep dish from Paxti's for $28 delivered in an hour."
1065,RIP Nardones...heard they closed yesterday. :(
1066,Mesa Pizza.
1067,"Taffy's is the best, especially for families"
1068,Nicky D's on De La Vina by a long shot. Im always amazed more people dont know about it!
1069,Giovannis on upper state. I've been going there since I was a kid. Favorite pizza place on the Central Coast. 
1070,"I second this, Gios on upper state is the best in town and the one in Isla Vista isn't bad either"
1071,"Lol, I just moved here and have a running list of places to eat.   I added Cesarito's a few days ago, but I couldn't find it, kept driving around and around. I'm glad you mentioned it being next to McDonald's otherwise I wouldn't have found this hidden gem."
1072,Wait do you mean little ceasears??
1073,In all seriousness Mesa pizza is our goto
1074,Marty’s on De La Vina is a hidden gem!! They do takeout only I think but have THE BEST classic flavorful pizza
1075,Santa Barbara Woodfire Catering out in Goleta at Captain Fatty's Brewery. Their Margarita is super good.  Olio's Pizzeria is good. The Umbra is wonderful.  And Gino's on Figueroa is classic.
1076,Little Caesars on Milpas
1077,I enjoy the white lobster calzone they have here.
1078,Ikr? Jokes aside I actually love Little Caesars
1079,Revolver Pizza on San Andreas is a new place. Heard nothing but good reviews. And the place that it used to be Paesano’s was my favorite in town. So if there is any remnant of Paesano’s there it’s gotta be good.
1080,Revolver & Noemi are both two great new places.
1081,Noemi? Never heard of it.
1082,Up by Vices and Spices? Sounds good. I’ll have to try it
1083,"Exactly the spot. I think I prefer Revolver, but was very impressed w/ what we got there last night. https://www.noemipizza.com"
1084,"Revolver has the best damn pies this side of the freeway, and probably the other side, too."
1085,I don’t understand the love for Rusty’s. Nostalgia? Having only tried it as an adult I think it’s objectively terrible pizza.   I usually make the drive to Toppers.
1086,"Rusty’s is great if you know what to order. Go pan pizza, get all the awesome toppings, and you can’t go wrong. I would also recommend *not* getting the small. For whatever reason, I’ve found personal, medium, and large to be beyond excellent, but the small is just weak.  \"
1087,"Thin crust, large pepperoni with extra cheese and 3 sides of ranch. This is the go to order for Rustys for me. It tastes like high school ."
1088,Rusty's is not great but the main selling point for me is the online ordering and fast delivery. Bettina is legitimately good pizza (and IMHO the best in the area) but you have to order IRL and then drive down to get it... 😞
1089,People actually like Bettina? It’s so bad!
1090,"Olio on Victoria st across from the public market. Make sure to go to the pizzeria and not Olio Limone the fancy restaurant in the front. Lucky Penny pizza in the funk zone Via Vai in montecito  Petrini’s and Giovanni’s in San Rocque And you can’t go wrong with 805-564-1111, order extra ranch."
1091,Unique Pizza - Noemi’s - very good
1092,"Woodstocks in IV on Mondays is B1GI large and extra large, so you can get 2 huge quality pizza's for $20 or so. No better deal. They have a good tangy sauce that they roll into the crust which I quite like.  Rusty's is probably my fave though."
1093,REVOLVERRRR
1094,Woodstock’s in IV is my husbands favorite
1095,"If you are looking for a solid, California pizza, go to Rusty's.  If you want a delicious New York style slice, the only option is Lilsy Wood Fire Pizza. I say this as a former New Yorker."
1096,"I concur. I ran into Nick (former owner) in the dog park several years ago. We ended up chatting for a while bc our dogs got along. He is a very NY Italian man. When he told me he had a pizza place in town, that was all I needed to know. A little expensive but definitely the only NY pizza here."
1097,I’m team Rusty’s (granted haven’t tried much else) but love the pan with Hawaiian toppings.
1098,"I was going to recommend Lilsy’s too, great stuff."
1099,Olio Pizzeria  is fantastic Neapolitan style pizza.   https://www.oliopizzeria.com/
1100,Never been to Roundtable (sorry) but my favs in town are Giovanni’s on Upper State followed by Rusty’s thin crust. Woodstocks is good if you like a lot of sauce and variety of pizzas. Heard good things about PizzaMan Dan’s in Carp.
1101,"If you haven't been to PizzaMan Dan's, don't bother. Absolute garbage."
1102,It’s my understanding that pizza man dans and toppers were both offshoots of rusty’s
1103,My favorite is Rusty's. Pizza My Heart in Isla Vista is also good.
1104,"The correct answer is Woodstock's. Honorable mentions Giovanni's and Taffy's. If you want to each the pizza that most of us eat on the regular, then Rusty's"
1105,Rustys
1106,"I can't believe no one has suggested Marty's Pizza.  I have only had their combo (or special; the one with all the stuff on it, whatever it's called), with pineapple instead of ground beef.  Nothing else compares.  There is a bit of inconsistency, but even on their less than stellar days, it's better than any delivered pizza I've had.  The crust is thin, which I like, but isn't for everyone.  It's not cheap, but worth it."
1107,Gino's. Turkey panini is also fire.
1108,"Persona Pizzeria on State Street.   [https://personapizzeria.com](https://personapizzeria.com)  905 State St, Santa Barbara, CA 93101, United States"
1109,Back in sanjose my favorite place to go was round table but it seems they don't have a location here. What places would you guys recomend that is anything like roundtable?
1110,Rusty’s is reasonably similar to Round Table. But there are many better spots like Bettina and Olio Pizzeria.
1111,Especially their pan cooked pizza reminds me a lot of Round Table.
1112,"Taffy’s for that style. My new favorite is Revolver pizza, on San Andreas. The closest to NY style I’ve found."
1113,"Giovanni's on upper state street.   [https://www.giovannispizzasb.com](https://www.giovannispizzasb.com/)   3020 State St, Santa Barbara, CA 93105  It's our favorite :)"
1114,Un Petite Ceasars on Milpas.
1115,"Try out Bettina, its more pricy and upscale but quality pizza"
1116,Rustys is a SB staple. Highly recommend.
1117,Born and raised in Sb...never had taffy’s 😫
1118,"Olio's Pizzeria is really good. There is a new pizzeria that opened on the west-side, only makes a certain number of pizzas a day, so have to get there early, called [Revolver](https://www.independent.com/2020/08/24/revolver-brings-new-york-pizza-to-the-santa-barbaras-westside/)  I usually make my own, better than what you get in SB."
1119,Go to Rusty's or the two on the Mesa (I forget their names)
1120,I love Petrini’s pizza also they have the best Italian sandwiches. Capicola is to die for.
1121,"Santa Barbara is where pizza comes to die. Its all just a hot mess and meh. There is a reason Santa Barbara has no Michelin Stars.  Case in point, the number of people telling you to go to little ceasers. WTActualF?"
1122,Are you dissing Le Petit Cesar?
1123,Round Table is so good. Rusty's isn't ;(  No recommendation. All of our pizza is pretty gross here. Had to comment because I just can't let the Round Table comparison go unchecked!
1124,Honor Bar got some good pizza
1125,"Have you tried Bettina over in Montecito? One of the owners, Brendan Smith came from Roberta's in Brooklyn."
1126,+1 for bettina!
1127,Oh cool nobody has said Little Caesars on Milpas yet.
1128,I really like Bettina. Petrinis is fairly good and crispy. Mollies has some good thin crispy pizza as well
1129,Love Petrinis !
1130,I like Gino's!
1131,Gino's on figueroa is my favorite
1132,+1 for Gino’s. Reasonably priced and always delicious.
1133,"Same here, I keep getting suggestions to got to places like giovannis which is honestly some of my least favorite pizza I’ve ever bought."
1134,"Yeah not a fan of that one. I remember also trying Uncle Rocco's ""NY Pizza"" and it was definitely not New York pizza"
1135,"Uncle roccos is floppy, greasy trash pizza for drunk people"
1136,Who told you to go to Giovannis? Most locals don’t like it
1137,Is it related to Gino's in Buellton? Best pizza in the SYV for sure.
1138,"There are some new places that have opened up recently, but this is my favorite. The Polpette is my GoTo."
1139, Lilsy Wood Fired Pizza on De La Vina is pretty good. Good Axxess deal too.
1140,Try the blonde bunny.  The others are ok but that bunny is stellar.
1141,I tried middle child a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised. I'll second Bettina but it's really expensive. lucky penny is pretty solid as well. Mizza also makes a pretty decent pizza. Being from Chicago the selection is definitely lacking overall.
1142,"Lucky Penny’s is legit. Only one size though, and not super expensive, but not really cheap."
1143,Marty’s pizza on De La Vina is my favorite
1144,"oof, i have had Marty's on recommendation and I did NOT like it. Gino's pizza is VERY good, and while Bettina is new, its VERY good as well. Olio pizzeria is good quality as well. I am very pleased to see the answers on here tbh.   &#x200B;  Good luck!"
1145,Marty’s is my jam!! Their Thai chicken pizza saves me every weekend from my hangovers
1146,"Bettina is so great, they use sourdough crust and their cocktails are also quite good. My second favorite is Lucky Penny - more casual atmosphere but very similar style pizza."
1147,Have you tried Olio Pizzeria?
1148,"Petrini’s definitely has a different crust.  I like it but I’m not sure it’s what you’re looking for.  They’re cheap though and worth a shot.  It kind of reminds me of saltines...not that it’s that crumbly/dry or even salty but it’s really more noticeable on day-old slices when you eat cold leftovers.  Not knocking it, just trying to describe it."
1149,"I have a ton, I’ve spent most of my time in SF, so definitely Tony’s, but really anywhere in North Beach is good. Honestly almost every place in the city is good.  I mostly don’t like the soft bready “pizza parlor” dough that places like Rusty’s, Marty’s, Giovannis, woodstock’s etc use. Sure, I’ll it eat it and won’t bring it up but I wouldn’t consider it to be “good pizza”.  Edit: being downvoted?"
1150,"Lmao I agree with you. I’m from NJ originally, and there is no real comparison out here.   Agreed with you on Rusty’s / Giovannis I’ll eat it at work, but it’s not good pizza it’s just decent and good value.   I personally gave up on pizza and embraced the local stuff here. SB, compared to other places I’ve lived, has an amazing variety of cheap Indian / Asian food, so I’m finding myself eating a lot more Indian food now."
1151,"Cheap Indian/Asian... share more, please..."
1152,Have you tried Olio Pizzeria? That place is legit. Grab the calimari with aioli and a cocktail while you’re there.
1153,OMG yes! Tony's is absolutely amazing!!!
1154,Hey I just moved back from SF! Yup Tony’s and golden boy are amazing and unmatched! Wanna be friends?
1155,"Bettina in Montecito, Olio Pizzeria in SB, and Lucky Penny in SB are all excellent choices."
1156,"lucky penny does make a good pizza, that's a good one too!"
1157,"NYer here. Ginos Sicilian is the closest to a NY pie. Bettina is good for the thin, wood fired pizza (think margarita pizza). Rusty’s is edible, fast, and all over the place (it’s a local chain)."
1158,Is Uncle Rocco’s any good? Or is it’s name and appearance a big fat lie?
1159,"For a native that hasn’t had pizza outside of Southern California, what makes a good pizza?  I find Patrini’s has the best sauce and sometimes I do crave that cracker style thin crust"
1160,"Patxis is pretty good. I'm a thinner crust kind of person and enjoy theirs. They also do deep dish, which I've never had, but have heard people enjoy it. I've eaten at Patxis with a New Yorker friend that is serious about a good slice and he finds Patxis acceptable."
1161,Patxis is more than acceptable haha. It's great and does the job.  Takes 50 min to make a deep dish tho
1162,"I could throw a stone from my house and break a back window at Patxis, so there is some convenience bias,  but we like it a lot . We order once a month on average.  I always pop the pie in the oven set to 500 for a few minutes, on a wire rack over a sheet pan to crisp it up.   Only ever had thin and usually get the Salsicia (sic?)"
1163,"To be honest, Whole Foods has better pizza than 90% of the spots in town"
1164,I'm always down for their PBJ (pineapple bacon jalepeno) pizza. They had one with broccoli on it which was really good too.
1165,"If you are out near lompoc check out Giant Manhattan pizza (Vandenberg village?), There is Ginos on Ave of the flags in buellton. And tower pizza is Solvang(reminds me of rustys)."
1166,"Lucky Penny has excellent wood fired pizzas. That's my favorite pie overall in SB after several years of trying everything.   Patxis on State for great deep dish, though they take a while to make."
1167,There is quite a few places petrinis Rusty's Giovanni's Taffy's etc
1168,"Gino's, by far. Happy to see many comments that echo it. The pizza is great, sandwiches are great, the prices (especially lunch special) are great and their weird homemade ranch is just one of those things you crave once you have it."
1169,Definitely Gino’s. Big floppy slices and perfectly chewy dough. Simple and delicious.   Woodstock’s tastes like marinara sauce and breadsticks. You can ask for “thin crust” but it just means they don’t fold the crust over to make that disgusting sauce pocket. I actually think their gluten free crust is decent - it’s more like a thin crust pizza.  But overall Woodstock’s would be my last choice other than Pizza Hut.
1170,"Pre-vegan, I always liked Patxi's pizza for their deep-dish which was close to a Chicago deep-dish (I lived there.) I also ate Patxi's when I lived in San Fran. Post-vegan, I still eat at Patxi's for the vegan deep dish, yum.  For regular pizza (non-vegan,) give Olio Pizzeria a try, gourmet type pizzas with a wood oven, delicious, try their umbra pizza (truffle pizza)...OMG, the bomb.  Now that I am vegan, whole foods fresh foods makes a good vegan pizza, but besides that I make my own. Never liked Rusty's, and Blaze Pizza was the worst."
1171,Paxtis pizza is pretty cool!
1172,"Pizza Online Company on Calle Real is absolutely fantastic.  Giovanni’s is good, too. Especially the location on the Mesa.  And Costco is actually pretty darn good."
1173,>Giovanni  Gio's on the Mesa closed
1174, [https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/07/15/mesa-giovannis-to-close/](https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/07/15/mesa-giovannis-to-close/) to be replaced by a Mesa Burger spin-off  [https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/12/09/mesa-burger-to-open-mesa-brew/](https://www.santabarbara.com/dining/news/2019/12/09/mesa-burger-to-open-mesa-brew/)
1175,Toscana for traditional Italian style pizzas! It’s in Solvang though. All the food there is worth the drive.
1176,Lisly Wood Fired Pizza on De la Vina. Their blonde bunny is excellent. I usually add sausage to it.
1177,"Lucky Penny is probably my favorite, but the sizes are relatively small. If you want to feed a lot of people it's pretty cost prohibitive."
1178,The wife and I love Olio Pizzeria. Does it count if it’s brick oven?
1179,"I’ve never been impressed with paxis. Even though i know it’s a chain, blaze is pretty good. Haven’t yet found a good ny style here (I lived in upstate NY for a while)"
1180,Oppi'z try the black margarita
1181,Just had Mizza two days ago and thought it was super good
1182,Really liked Blaze when I lived in IV.
1183,Woodstock's Pizza in Isla Vista is the only great one I've found nearby.
1184,Thanks for the suggestion but Woodstock’s is hands down the worst pizza I’ve ever had and actually inspired me to make this post after eating a fluffy slice of the bread that they call crust.
1185,I’ve never got the Woodstock’s hype
1186,"Paesanos was my go-to but they closed.  Lilsy is OK.  My work gets Taffy's for special events...that makes Woodstocks taste good.  I was super disappointed in Olio...their carbonara pizza was basically scrambled eggs and we watched the dude pick shells out of our pizza for the quail egg pizza.    These days, I mostly make it...Whole foods has Tipo 00 flour for about $3 from Italy."
1187,"Try the Bon Appetit ""best pizza"" recipes.  I've been using sourdough so you let it ferment for 3-5 days for best flavor."
1188,Rusty’s
1189,"I joke a lot about SB only serving burgers and pizza. Considering that this is the most comments I've seen on a post in the subreddit, I'm probably not wrong."
1190,"No, this town has the world's shittiest pizza. Bettina, mollies, and petrinis are way too expensive for pizza--and just ok. Lucky penny sucks; giovannis sucks; ptaxis sucks; rusty's is an abomination; woodstock isn't even pizza; martys used to be ok for the money, but now it sucks. Haven't tried Ginos or Middle Child."
1191,"I mean, I can’t say I disagree with you on your assessment of Lucky Penny, Giovannis, Paxtis, Rustys (hate it), Woodstock’s (is this even legal?), And Marty’s."
1192,"I'll defend Rusty's. It's my favorite ""fast food"" delivery style place in the area.  Doesn't hold a candle to real NY pizza or a Chicago deep dish slice, but its competing with Dominoes, not the legit"
1193,I feel like its the only fight it tried to put up haha.  I like how they still have arcade machines and salad bars too.  Reminds me of how Pizza hut used to be back in the day.
1194,Sakana sushi. That place is better than the sushi I find in Japan.
1195,"Try Sushi | Bar in Montecito!  It's expensive but definitely the best sushi I've had outside of Japan.  Good date spot as well :) ... Oh also... hell yeah, Sakana is absolutely awesome."
1196,"If you like indian food, try out Apna Kitchen. Imo its better than Tamira was"
1197,LITTLE CAESARS ON MILPAS BABY YES
1198,"Sushi: Arigato  Steakhouse: Lucky's  ""Fancy"" Mexican: Los Agaves  Mexican: El Sitio  Breakfast / Bakery: Renauds  Italian: Maestra 42  Pizza: Giovannis on State  Indian: Flavor of India  Special mention: Loquita (Spanish Tapas)  &#x200B;  Enjoy!"
1199,Giovannis on State is absolutely the best pizza in town.
1200,+1 for El Sitio Thai food: Galanga Burgers: Mesa Burger Brewery/Burgers: Modern Times or Brewhouse
1201,The Shop~ it’s on Milpas. Best breakfast.
1202,East Beach Tacos is our lunch go too.
1203,I'm kind of amazed Tamira lasted as long as it did. I really liked their deserts. I like the place that opened up where Aldos was it's named Embermill and it's great!  *edit: an apostrophe*
1204,Embermill is so freakin good!
1205,"Tamira was not a good Indian place. The best Indian in town, at the moment, is Masala Spice in Goleta."
1206,"Their deserts were pretty good. Overall, I won't miss them though. I do miss Tupelo though. SB has lost so many great restaurants over the years. RIP Paparazzi, Margie's Diner & Sambos."
1207,"Here's a few of my favorites, not just the place itself but my favorite items on the menu. I don't eat meat but I trust that most of these places that serve meat do it well:  Korean Chicken Sandwich at Modern Times   Crispy Tofu Poke Bowl at Kanaloa Seafood   Lunch Special (Slice, salad and drink) at Gino's Siclian Express   Rascal's Burrito at Super Cucas on Micheltorena   Kale & Brussels Salad + Fries at Creekside   Spicy Edamame, Edamame Gyoza and Avocado/Cucumber Roll at Edomasa   Zen Roll at Arigato Sushi"
1208,"That korean chicken sandwich is incredible. I'm no vegan, yet I find the food at Modern Times to be really satisfying."
1209,"Craft Ramen on State, best Ramen in the whole city"
1210,This is the correct answer except it’s more accurate to say the best ramen north of LA
1211,"Empty Bowl inside the SB public market. Try the Northern Thailand Curry Noodle ""KHOA SOI""."
1212,khao*
1213,Oh snap! That typo is from Empty Bowl's website. [Check it out.](http://www.emptybowlnoodle.com/menu)
1214,"Awesome! Is it difficult? I bought Andy Ricker's book 'Pok Pok' specifically for this recipe, but have been too intimidated to try it."
1215,"Deja Vu out in IV. Amazing, cheap food. Either that, or Your Place on milpas for thai food"
1216,"> Deja Vu out in IV.  Ah, memories of cheese fries after a night of having a beer or two during college. They even delivered. It was utterly disgusting then and I can't imagine it has changed that much, but I thoroughly enjoyed that greasy mess at the time."
1217,Only deja vu if you’re drunk though. Sober deja is a no go.
1218,"Live Oak, near Cottage Hospital, serves up very stylish and tasty food at very reasonable prices. Bettina, in Montecito, is great too, like a chic East Village pizza restaurant."
1219,+1 for Live Oak.
1220,Best late night drunken food with friendly bartenders: Harry’s
1221,I love the club sandwich
1222,Blue Owl pork Bahn mi is so good it’s sexy.
1223,Freebirds Burritos in IV is delicious for quick and non fancy foods. The farmers market downtown is amazing as well.
1224,Freebirds nachos are the best. Great to share with two or three people.
1225,Los Agaves for sure.
1226,"Toma, Barbereno, The Creekside, The Palace, Opal, Lilly's, The Korean BBQ Wings from Hollister Brewing."
1227,I kinda don’t want to say this so I don’t blow it up but Buena Onda is the move
1228,Blue Owl
1229,Metropolus has the best sandwiches in town. Country Meat Market is the best sandwich in Goleta.
1230,Spearmint rhino.. Best buy one get one free offers.
1231,Derfs is my spot. Don’t hate.
1232,Breakfast - Cajun Kitchen on De La Vina.  Lunch - Norton's Pastrami.  Dinner - Ichiban Sushi.  Happy Hour - Lure Fishhouse.  Dessert - Milk Shake at Kyle's.  Late Night - Milk & Honey.
1233,Nortons serves you a school girls sandwich for like $20. Hard pass. ..
1234,\+1 Milk & Honey. Open later than almost anything  AND has great cocktails for a weeknight date!
1235,I always love the chef’s menu at Black Sheep - that dude just feeds and feeds you delicious food until you cry mercy.
1236,"Get a triple play from East Beach Tacos... My favorites are the spicy crispy shrimp, the Gangnam style, and the ahi poke tacos."
1237,"Also, Apna Indian Kitchen is bomb!"
1238,Bree’osh is an awesome breakfast cafe in Montecito
1239,There is a Korean market on Patterson next to Domino's. In the back there's an old Korean lady cooking food you can order.  Chois oriental market
1240,I’ve been to Chois! Really good food since we don’t have much good Korean cuisine but it’s p pricey
1241,Chicken Ranch.
1242,"You'll be happy to hear it hasn't changed a bit since you left. Chicken Ranch is a staple if you've lived here more than 10 years. Quality is the same it's always been, and the salsa is unbeatable.  I can see why people think it's boring. Makes me think about how Paradise Cafe was just sold and they immediately changed up the Paradise Burger -- wtf guys, why would you fuck with the staple of the entire restaurant? Now I have no reason to go there."
1243,"WHAT oh noooo, the Paradise Burger was my favorite!"
1244,I think Chicken Ranch is great and was surprised at downvotes. When we don't want to cook and want something good the meal with two pieces of chicken and beans and rice is tough to beat.
1245,Date night spot: The Daisy on State at Victoria
1246,Lunch: Monys  Dinner: Opal
1247,"226 south Milpas for East Beach tacos, it’s at the batting cages. 730 north Milpas is The Shop."
1248,"Middle Child (Cota/State) for everything.      The chef/owner used to work for the Lark.  They use simple, fresh ingredients to make unpretentious dishes that taste great. I would describe it as modern American.  The decor is great too with Santa Barbara-themed murals painted on the walls. Good spot for when your out-of-town friends are visiting and you want to give them a sense of local scene but want to avoid more tourist-oriented restaurants."
1249,"Basically the entire menu is copied from The Lark/Lucky Penny. The food’s not bad, but it’s not exactly unique."
1250,"Coming from a “foodie” city, gotta say, the food here has been disappointing but here is my list:  Pizza: Bettina in Montecito; Loquita; Zaytoon for ambience—food is ok; Carusos for fine dining with great ambience; Tacos: east beach; Merci montecito —best chocolate chip cookie in town, good sides to go sit and eat outside; Breakfast: field and fort in summerland, bree osh, handlebar coffee; Coffee: handlebar, low pigeon or dune   Have yet to find a thai restaurant that has flavor. Any recs?"
1251,> Merci montecito —best chocolate chip cookie in town  How does it compare to the chocolate chip cookie at Andersen's?
1252,"for me the best PIZZA place here is Bettina's which took a while to discover (totally randomly). I've lived in really-good-pizza-cities like Manhattan and haven't found any other places here on par with Bettina's including Giovannis. <3.       Best Mexican for tacos, burritos imho is Mony's in the funk zone. Their veggie burrito is the best I've ever had and their homemade salsas are amazing especially the avocado!"
1253,"When did this notion that Giovannis pizza is great pizza come about? I don't recall it mentioned in pizza threads and don't recall it being very good, although I haven't had it in probably 15 years so maybe it got better?  But agreed on Bettina, we enjoyed everything we've had there."
1254,"I'm not sure as I haven't been in SB very long but agreed! Places like Ginos, Lucky Penny are much better but I rank Bettina above all. Their margherita  and mushroom pizzas are divine :)"
1255,"Ahoy fingerfunk! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:  I be nay sure as me haven't been in SB very long but agreed! Places like Ginos, Lucky Penny be much better but me rank Bettina above all. Their margherita  n' mushroom pizzas be divine :)"
1256,Tyger Tyger on Yanonali 💖🐯💖
1257,Hook and Press Donuts in the Mosaic!!
1258,"Pizza My Heart is my fav! Everyone there is super friendly, I miss hangin out"
1259,Woodstocks is soooo overpriced for both the quality and quantity tho
1260,my roommate and i used to get Rusty’s every month and split the whole pie. their veggie pizza is 🤤
1261,"Honestly, maybe controversial opinion here, but I think pizza is lacking in IV. Pizza my Heart/Woodstocks are solid but too expensive, and Blaze is p good but it's like $12 for a pizza. The Dominos is kinda ass imo. If I had to pick, I'd say Blaze is the best but it's pricy."
1262,Little ceasers deep deep dish >
1263,"> Their wings are fantastic, also. Small store with no seating, menu is only pizza and calzones, and they also sell by the slice.  That's how you know.  Menu is only pizza and calzones but they have fantastic wings?  For anyone curious about their menu, it's here:  http://www.ginospizzapies.com/menu.html  If a pizza place is looking to evoke the NY feel the name Gino's is the way to go."
1264,Last time I got Ginos was awful. Might as well have ate the cardboard box it came in
1265,"Yeah, Gino’s is what’s up."
1266,Is it related to Gino's in Buellton? By far the best pizza in the SYV.
1267,Can we plz have more sb memes? This is good stuff
1268,Just advertise the hidden valley ranch as a locally sourced ingredient and boom - price justified.
1269,Ok yes exactly this. Like yeah there are so many better/different pizzas in town but sometimes I just want Rusty’s lol
1270,"I went and got a fancy pizza from Bettina and it cost less than Rusty's no joke.   If you want good old american pepperoni pizza, Costco is the way"
1271,Bettina might be “fancy” but it’s shit pizza. I’d gladly pay Rusty’s prices for it if it meant I’d get more than a goddamn teaspoon of sauce.
1272,"american pizza is shit pizza. sorry if that’s what you’re used to, but bettina’s pizza is more authentic italian pizza. the american version of pizza is an abomination. it honestly ought to have been renamed something else to avoid confusion and not disrespect italian food and culture."
1273,Recently discovered Marty’s
1274,"Taffy crew checking in! I like the foghorn leg horn. Though I mostly bake it for an extra 5-10 minutes when I bring it home.   I used to love pizza guru but they finally closed. A calzone, nice salad and a drink lunch special was 10 bucks.   Also Valentinos take and bake is great."
1275,Was going to upvote for pizza guru but can’t because Valentino’s gives me the absolute worst gas.
1276,Woodstock's every Monday is Bogo for large and XL. Best deal on town.
1277,Rusty's is both overpriced and ass. Stick to Gino's.
1278,I prefer Woodstock's for SB pizza.
1279,"I’ve only tried their garlic chx/garlic bird pizza because I live in LA, but it was amazing. Looking forward to trying some others.  Any favorites/suggestions?"
1280,"Hey, that works! I loooove the Cali veggie pizza w/ goat cheese at CPK."
1281,IV Classic is my favorite pizza this side of Chicago.
1282,Tater tot pizza!
1283,That sounds awesome! The Kickin Carnitas has my attention too. Sounds amazing.
1284,Online pizza company in Goleta is cheap and good .  Try it out.
1285,I miss Pizza Guru...
1286,I fucking live Rusty’s. Nothing like a Rusty’s pizza with pepperoni and olives with an ice cold beer.
1287,Noemi Pizza Romana now that is expensive pizza. Just found out they are permanently closed. Too bad they were good.
1288,"Aren't pizza's everywhere expensive? They use to be the cheapest thing to eat in college, lived on them back in the day. Now you would have to take out a student loan before ordering.  I make my own, for pennies, best in town."
1289,"Boomer moment here, but does anyone remember Mr.C's pizza in the magnolia shopping center? Had an awesome arcade and the pizza was pretty good but that last part might be just rose colored glasses"
1290,Topper's in Ventura County same issue
1291,Former east coaster here. I ordered Rusty’s once when I moved here fifteen years ago. The end.
1292,Domino’s thin crust FTW!
1293,"Lily's Tacos (adobada tacos)  Happy Hour @ Lure (Ahi Ceviche, Oysters and drinks!)  Ichiban Sushi, on the Mesa.  Habit, Double Char with Onion Rings and a Shake.  The Boathouse @ Hendry's Beach.   "
1294,"If you like noodles, gotta try Empty Bowl in the Public Market. It's glorious."
1295,"Seconded. For anyone who's been to northern Thailand, their Khao soi is legit. Hard to find this dish anywhere in America tbh so I'm stoked they have it here"
1296,Sama Sama for Indonesian  Blue Owl for late night Indonesian
1297,"Super Cucas Market on Micheltorena for a nice afternoon burrito, local family owned and by far my favorite burrito"
1298,"Skip Arigato, the better sushi is Shintori.  There's a pretty good Korean BBQ place called kimchi on old state.  For mexican food, there's Santo mezcal or for more legit Mexican, la super rica or el buen gusto.  The good lion is my absolute favorite place for cocktails.  Enjoy!"
1299,> old state  What's old state?  Shintori is better than Arigato?  La Superica is legit Mexican?  I do like Good Lion.
1300,"so many choices.... ok I'll break them down by style:  Japanese: Arigato Sushi  Mexican: Los Agaves (sit down) La Super Rica (tacos, informal, cash only)  American: Lucky's (steak, $$$) Brophy Bros. (seafood, on the harbor)  French/American: The Lark  French: Stella Mare's  Italian: Ca' Dario, Pascucci  Pizza!: local favorite is Rusty's but I prefer Gino's (more east coast style) and if you want Chicago style Patxi's does amazing deep dish.  Brunch: Cajun Kitchen, Bree'osh, Jeannine's, FisHouse  If you can't decide what to eat try the Public Market with a beer garden, wine grotto, and everything from tacos to ice cream and thai street food!  There are so many unique and amazing places to eat you won't even break the surface with being here for a long weekend. But please try!"
1301,This is awesome. I made a res at the lark. Seeing it pop up a ton. Think im planning on doing Arigato but know there is no res. Any local favorites / off the beaten path I need to try?
1302,"I’m seconding everything he said above but also sakana for sushi, wildwood (or brunois if it’s Monday/Tuesday), super cucas for Mexican, shellfish co or on the alley for seafood, trattoria Vitoria for Italian, boathouse for brunch.  "
1303,Seconding Trattoria Vitoria!
1304,I like the Shop Kitchen for an unhealthy but tasty breakfast. 
1305,"If you’re a fan of simpler sushi and a focus on delicious fish, I agree with Arigato over some of the others mentioned.  I’ll also second Paxti’s for pizza, I always end up there people watching from their great bar facing State Street,  amazing deep dish pizza I‘be been known to drive from LA for.  If you have a vegetarian in the group I highly suggest Vegan GreenGO on State.  I’ve only been there once but they make all their own “meats” and they were all truly delicious. Go even if you aren’t vegetarian and balance out one of your more indulgent meals!  The Palace is great for a satisfying Cajun experience with friends. It’s been so popular for years I don’t think it gets mentioned here much, similar to La SuperRica for tacos."
1306,Arigato is overpriced. Sakana is higher quality by far. 
1307,"Mediterranean: Zaytoon  Sunday Brunch: El Paseo  Wine Tasting: Deep Sea (mostly for the atmosphere, on the wharf)"
1308,Loquita. Hands down. 
1309,Little Caesars on Milpas.
1310,Not sure why? May I suggest... Little Caesars on Milpas?
1311,"There really isn't any exceptional restaurants if you are comparing to major metro areas like LA/SF. With that said, there are some good places.  - Lucky Penny/Les Marchands/Lark are all owned by the same group and are all very good - Arigato for sushi. Sakana is pretty good too, but my vote goes to Arigato. - Sama Sama with cocktails before hand at good lion is a good pairing - Honor Bar in Montecito is really solid - Outside of SB, but SY Kitchen is San Ynez is fantastic. Industrial Eats in Buelton is also incredible."
1312,"For Mexican food you've got plenty but it all depends what you want to eat. So you got Los Agaves, Santo Mezcal, Los Arroyos etc. If you want cheap eats you got Cucas on micheltorena, Litos take out, Cuernavaca, lilly's tacos. I've eaten  in almost every restaurant in SB (usually family owned restaurants).  But I usually dine in old town now. Red Pepper here i come!   If any questions dm me ! "
1313,"Sure! Is there any specific food your group is looking for or restaurant that are good for groups and kids?  Here are some, Super Cucas, Rustys Pizza, * Cuernavaca, The Habit, On The Alley (harbor), Daves Dog on Hollister ( the cart is temporarily closed), Paesanos on the mesa and to finish it off you got blenders.   *ps. If you to Cuernavaca order alambres/fortachon or the other three plates under that one. Its da best. And if you are getting tacos pimp them out with onions, cilantro, salsa and radish, lemons and chile carrot vinaigrette on the side. Don't leave those poor tacos naked. Gorditas de tinga or chicharron de salsa verde are to die for... ok im done. Enjoy!"
1314,"If you’re up for it Broad St Oyster Co is in the funk zone on weekends in front of Muni Wine. I haven’t been there yet, but I’ve heard it’s amazing.  Little Door has good appetizers.  Brophy’s for garlic baked clams. "
1315,"Some of the best sushi I’ve had in town was at Goleta Sushi House. Awesome dumplings and beef tendon at Dumpling King, which also does great flat fish but not this time of year. IV Deli Mart does some pretty good sandwiches. Grilled Cheese Truck, which is an actual shop, has some great stuff but it’s super heavy. "
1316,Stay out late and get After Dark Mac N Cheese from Velvet Jones. Don't get the gross bbq chicken or tater tots on it though. 
1317,"Ok here goes,  Brunch at Scarlet Begonia   Monys Tacos  Barberino  Loquita   The Lark  Sama Sama, sometimes they are better than other times,"
1318,"I like Mony's. Nearby and also good is Shalhoob.   I didn't see anyone post it, but somewhat underrated is taqueria El bajio. Get a torta if you go there.   There was a recent post where someone gave a fantastic list for the santa ynez valley if you're going to make it up there.   https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/9566xk/restaurant_recommendations_inaround_buellton_syv/"
1319,Shanghai for Chinese food.   La Tapatia for Mexican food.   The Habit for burgers.   Blenders for smoothie.   
1320,Really good. Id even go as far as saying its an affordable Bettinas...
1321,So glad to see that someone did something with Paesano's. That dude that used to own the place made me not want to get food there.
1322,Secret Bao
1323,😮 damn that looks good. Any places that sells matcha lemonade thats not Starbucks?
1324,Maybe green table
1325,Milk and Honey is my favorite spot for drinks and small plates!
1326,"Downtown: Scarlet Begonia and The Empty Bowl, At the Marina, Brophys, For in Montecito check out The Miramar"
1327,Scarlet Begonia always has open reservations which turns me off. Will check out though
1328,Brophys is really good!
1329,Monys for Mexican food. Norton’s and South Coast for a sandwich/salad
1330,Mony's is always the right answer.
1331,"I like Benchmark Eatery, Savoy Cafe, China Pavilion, Zaytoon, Playa Azul, Carlitos."
1332,Mesa Verde
1333,"Mesa Verde is fully vegan and it’s by far my favorite restaurant in SB, even though I’m not fully vegan. It was actually awarded the Bib Gourmand award from the Michelin guide (great meals for under $40) but didn’t get any stars."
1334,My two favs right now are Corazon Cocina in the public market and Sama Sama kitchen on state (Indonesian food with amazing flavors - don’t miss the traditional wings).
1335,"Corazon Cocina is SUPER good, just at a higher level than anything twice the price. The quesadilla de mercado especially, dear gawd. I'm super bummed they had to close their lower State location, but I'm glad the original in Public Market is going strong."
1336,The quesadilla de mercado is hands down the best vegetarian dish in town.
1337,The WINGS!!
1338,"Corazon is amazing, that Norteño taco is 🔥🔥🔥"
1339,Bettina and Barbareño are two other great spots.
1340,Also try out their sister restaurants Cubaneo and Barbs Pies next to the Fox Tail. Cubaneo and Barb are both owned by the same owner of Barbareño
1341,Loquita.
1342,Nikka Ramen! Definitely the best!
1343,Just went there today and got the Curry Ramen 🤤 never disappoints
1344,"Omg I would go there every day if Ramen wasn’t so calorie dense hahaha, but second this it’s great"
1345,"Molly’s for Italian, she cooks everything from scratch and you can taste it in every bite. I get the pasta bolonaise which is like heaven."
1346,"Cristino’s bakery, only the weekends between 11-2pm they serve birria and consommé and it is heavenly. Empty bowl is spectacular. Love Mesaburger. Also there’s a smaller tapas bar that’s the sister restaurant of milk&honey, called Alcazar. It’s smaller and more laid back, and they have music some nights. Definitely go to Bettina’s."
1347,Los Agaves (De la Vina) and the Lark
1348,Need to try the Lark. Los Agaves was tasty
1349,"If you noticed that Los Agaves was a major notch above typical SoCal Mexican, then Santo Mezcal is that same notch above Los Agaves.  Same owner.  My favorite Mexican ever!"
1350,Best pizza in town is a small local pizzeria off Milpas called Cesarito's!
1351,Little Caesar’s on Milpas obviously
1352,The Shop for breakfast.
1353,Oliver’s
1354,Via maestro or Roy
1355,Revolver Pizza
1356,"Metropulos for sandwiches! The gyro and the pesto chicken are my favs. Close to there is Lucky Penny for pizza and Helena Bakery for pastries. I also love East Beach Tacos, and echo others on Corazon Cocina for fancy (but really, really good) Mexican. The yuzu ramen at Nikka blew my actual mind. Renaud's for pastries and brunch (the quiche is great). Idk if Third Window Brewing still does food but I've loved every iteration of their menu.   And obvs a jaunt down the 154 to Cold Spring Tavern for Tri-tip sandwiches."
1357,You know as long as I lived there I never went to Cold Spring Taven. Gonna have to stop for sure.
1358,Go to Chase and ask for Warren the owner. The food is incredible!
1359,"Recently discovered the Banh Mi sandwich from 4 Eggs and Pizza, one of my new favorites.    I also enjoy the hardshell asada tacos from Monys, brussel sprouts from the Lark, either wings from Sama Sama, and BBQ chicken pizza from Yellow Belly.   Oh and chicken chipotle club sandwich or Mexican chicken Cesar salad from South Coast Deli"
1360,"South coast is always solid. The Lark seems to be poppin, It’s made the list for sure. All of these look amazing, thank you."
1361,A couple of breakfast spots 1. Boathouse at Hendry’s beach  2. Recipes Bakery (Santa Barbara street and Cota)
1362,"""Bakersfield Pizza Co. & Bar"" and ""Slice of Italy"" are both good. Mountain Mike's is also pretty decent."
1363,"Santa Barbara Pizza always gets overlooked.  It's a good, solid, cheap pizza.  You want something a bit extra?  Calzone from Rosas.  Artichoke, mushroom, garlic, basil, with marinara sauce and a side of putanesca sauce."
1364,Santa Barbara's Cowboy pizza is bomb.
1365,Santa Barbara pizza is my vote.
1366,Cataldos
1367,"Cataldo’s SW, specifically."
1368,Oildale is OG and all locations have been good in my experience!  Had it tonight as a matter of fact!🍕
1369,"I don’t know how their traditional pepperoni is, but my favorite pizza of all time is the New York City Pizza from Cataldo’s. It’s a pesto sauce, with sun dried tomatoes, sausage slices, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and red onion. It is so good."
1370,Rosa’s on Columbus and Slice of Italy on F street.
1371,"am i the only one that thinks Slice of Italy isn't very good? I don't know why people keep praising this place, its pretty average pizza."
1372,Second Rosa’s.
1373,Go to LR’s in Delano :P
1374,"I know that LR's isn't in Bakersfield, but if you are willing to travel to Delano, it is seriously the best pizza I've ever eaten. It is perfect."
1375,"You can't beat Rosa's. Making pizzas there was my first job. It was already my favorite pizza and seeing how it's made just increased my love and appreciation more. The dough is made from scratch and rolled to order as fresh as can be, the cheese is shredded from the block so there's none of that plasticy additive that preshredded cheese has, and the sauce is made from scratch and let sit for a day for the flavors to blend. Toppings are almost all fresh cut as well. Really incredible shit."
1376,Steve’s Pizza on Rosedale is my pick
1377,Tony’s pizza.  Love their chili verde pizza.
1378,"No love for Magoo's? Might depend on which location, but the upper east side one is great. Could be because my siblings and I went to Highland with one of the sons of the owners though. California style pizza like Rusty's."
1379,Manhood on east side is not that great in my opinion  However  The magoos on district blvd is fucking amazing. They make their wedges and pizzas different than the east side one. I live On the east side but I’d rather drive to district.
1380,"Damn, I think the ES one is damned good, so if that one is not great by comparison, the District location must be amazing. Too bad for me I have so little reason to drive so far the fuck into the sprawl, but if I ever do, I'll try and hit up that one."
1381,Magoos has my vote easily
1382,Damn no one said Pizzaville USA! Is that place still open?
1383,Go out of town to Santa Clarita and get Toppers. Just make a pilgrimage of it.
1384,But if you gonna go to Santa Clarita why settle for pizza when you could get kbbq
1385,Korean Barbeque. Gogi house in Santa Clarita is fantastic.
1386,I like Me-n-Ed's. The one on Hageman and Coffee is reliable and they have a large pizza carryout deal.
1387,They have a super cheap calzone lunch combo I love.
1388,mountain mikes 👌🏻
1389,Thanks guys ended up going to Rusty’s lol but for sure I’ll eventually try these other places
1390,Why? That place is constantly getting shut down due to health code violations.  Pizza Hut has better pizza than Rusty’s.
1391,Rusty's has the best tasting potato wedges. no joke anytime I go to Rusty's is mainly because of the wedges.
1392,Slice of Italy on Hageman and Verdugo
1393,Cubbies for sure.
1394,Bakersfield Pizza Co!
1395,"Rosa’s, Cubbies, any Rusty’s east of the 99. Pizzaville, LR’s in Delano, Pizza Barn in Kernville."
1396,LRs in Delano is worth it
1397,New Vintage Grill and cheap beer too.
1398,"My vote for Mountain Mike's.   Thick cut pepperoni,  spicy-ish sauce, great crust."
1399,Mountain Mikes
1400,Frugattis
1401,"I looked for the same thing a few months ago, a headset that got very high quality sound and are also wireless, I tried a few and send them back, Then I went for the Bose one after I saw it being recommended again and again (the number 2 model on this list [https://digitalaquarius.com/best-headphones/](https://digitalaquarius.com/best-headphones/) ) and it basically changed my life, audio quality is awesome but more than anything is the noise canceling on those are insane. Also they are super comfortable on my ears! I can wear them for hours at at time and it does not bug me at all (had a sony before and couldn't wear them more then an hour without having to take a break)"
1402,"Bose sound quality is a joke lol. Its so boring. Flat reference sounds is already boring but bose takes it next level, literally nothing pops lol. My picks are:  Sony XM4 - for best noise cancelling but boomy bassy sound  Sennheiser momentum - for fun sound but ok anc  b&w px7 - for best all-round, great sound and good anc. although sound quality dips a lot with anc on"
1403,So not to Bose?
1404,\+1 on the [Bose 700](https://reddlink.tech/bose-700) headphones. Very solid.
1405,"Actually, yes you have plenty of options.   If you want the best sounding closed back wireless headphones without ANC, the $380 (on sale) Drop THX Panda is a great choice. They use planar drivers and have THX's AAA amp technology. It has LDAC for semi-lossless streaming. If you have an iPhone LDAC does not matter, it does not support it.   If you don't mind open back, the HiFiMan Deva for $300 is an excellent choice. I had the drop wired version, the HE-5XX and they sounded awesome except for a slight treble distortion at high volumes. This also has LDAC.   If you wanted to go cheaper, the AKG K361BT is a good option for about $100-ish. It does not have LDAC.   If you needed ANC, one of the best sounding options is the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless for $350 (on sale)."
1406,Having Ldac doesn't mean anything if the user has an iphone
1407,the sennheiser momentum 3 sounds like absolute garbage and is probably the worst thing sennheiser makes (including the hd820). xm3/4 sounds wayyy better and has better anc anyway
1408,The XM4 has better ANC but the M3 sounded much better to me.
1409,"I agree, never meant to say they sound awesome just one of the better ANC headphones. Personally don't like the sound of the Sony XM3/4 too bassy and shrill for me. Kind of odd considering I like how the WF-1000XM3 sounds."
1410,"Passive mode seems to be what a lot of headphone manufacturers fall flat on, my WF's passive mode is ""alright"" at best.   If you wanted the *TRUE* passive experience just pick up a set of open back cans. ಡ ͜ ʖ ಡ"
1411,"I have a pair and they aren't the best sound. I use the Senn app to EQ the bass all the way down and they are still too bassy, but Bose and Sony sound even worse to my ear. I have yet to hear an ANC that sounds even decent, but they aren't really for audiophile applications."
1412,"Better ANC, yes. Sounds better? Maybe if you like bass that completely veils and colors the mids, especially with the XM3s.  If that's your sound signature, go for it.  The Sennheiser M3 Wireless has punchy bass but far more detailed mids and less grainy treble than the XM3/XM4. It's not even close."
1413,What about sennhiesers HD8
1414,"I have the momentum 3, to my ears it’s not a competition at all. The XMs are all bass, the M3 actually have some range (although still elevated in the bass)"
1415,"I have the Pandas, they sound great (not life changing or anything), but I wouldnt recommend them.  The firmware is buggy as hell, and they are prone to serious issues because of a cheap bluetooth reciever& shoddy batteries.  I've been through three already since November.  Their only saving grace is customer service will send you a new one at the drop of a hat. Tney are also extremely heavy and have practically no headband padding, which makes them extremely uncomfortable if you wear them for more than an hour.  Extra padding is hit or miss because nothing sticks to them (nuggets wont work) and the headband barely extends far enough to accomodate them anyway, so if you have a big head they won't extend far enough to fit."
1416,There’s also the hifiman Ananda bt
1417,sennheisers momentum true wireless 2 sound amazing for wireless earbuds.
1418,"I'd say bowers & Wilkins. They cost more than XM4 or Bose 700, but imo are worth it."
1419,I really enjoy the Grado GW100s. I find myself using them a lot more than I ever expected to.
1420,Hifiman Ananda BT. I've used them and they are amazing. They sound as good as the wired versions in my opinion.
1421,I gifted someone the Devas and got to demo them- actually really impressed by them!
1422,"I happen to have the HD 598 and I love it so much that I bought more for family members. I use it with the LG G7 (has the quad DAC) and in several ways, I like it more than some more expensive open back headphones.    Are there any wireless headphones that are of the same quality as the HD 598? To be blunt, I sure haven't tried any that come close and I think it is going to be difficult to find good wireless headphones that come close to benchmark open back headphones.   It may be the case that there are Bluetooth headphones that are better but it would likely be the ones that are expensive (more than the Airpods Max) as those are the ones I haven't tried. There are wireless headphones that sound good but going wireless and having ANC is going to have a negative impact on sound quality.   ANC is also expensive tech and getting a premium Bluetooth pair of headphones with tons of features also raises the price so it is understandable why they are this price despite not offering the same sound quality (although the Airpods Max is still too much for what it offers)."
1423,"Same boat here - love the 598, want something wireless, but I also want the felt pads. I haven’t seen any good wireless headphones with felt pads."
1424,Drop Panda
1425,Best and recommended noise-cancelling wireless headphones 40-400 USD:   * Bose QC 35 ← top sound quality * Bose 700 ← top sound quality * Sennheiser PXC 550-II ← top sound quality * Shure AONIC 50 ← top sound quality * Razer Opus * Sony WH-1000XM4 * Anker SoundCore Life Q20 ← nicely priced * Sony WH-H910N * JBL LIVE 650BTNC * Puro Sound Labs PuroPro * Monoprice BT-300ANC ← nicely priced * Microsoft Surface Headphone 2 * Sony WH-1000XM3 * beats by dre Beats Studio3 Wireless * Marshall Monitor II A.N.C. * Beats by Dr. Dre Solo Pro * Beyerdynamic Lagoon ANC Traveler * Jabra Elite 85h  Non-cancelling wireless  * Grado GW100 * Bose SoundLink around-ear headphones II * Jabra Move Style Edition * V-Moda Crossfade 2 Wireless * Audio-Technica ATH-SR5BT * beats by dre Solo3 Wireless * JBL LIVE 500BT * Sennheiser HD 4.40BT * Skullcandy Hesh 3 Wireless
1426,"i would not say that bose is top quality wireless sound, the wireless sennheiser equipment i’ve tried sounds significantly better than the bose 700 and both quiet comforts. also i wouldn’t put beats anywhere on that list."
1427,"Beats solo 3 and studio sound very good for the price. And beats solo pro sounds good full stop. ""beats = bad"" has become a meme in itself"
1428,dude look up all the frequency response graphs for al of those headphones and then compare it to sennheisers headphones that are in that price range.
1429,"Frequency response doesnt = fun to listen to. Just look at all the people recommending bose qc. The most boring headphones ive ever listened to, literally nothing pops  Funny you mention sennheiser because those have a very very v shaped response"
1430,"Werent thw galaxy buds pro rated as the best sounding TWS by crinacle, to my ears they are the best ive ever heard, thats coming from a anandas user"
1431,have you tried sennheisers momentum true wireless 2?
1432,"Ah, I see. I was wondering why the Lagoons were as low is all."
1433,"Good list.  I will say that the Anker Sound Core Life Q30 are LEAGUES better than the Q20s, and can be EQed to punch way above their weight class at $80."
1434,"From this list, actually usable are    Bose 700   Sony WH-1000XM4   Jabra 85h     and that's it.   I'd probably consider Cloud 2 wireless if you want wireless headsets as that's pretty much the best there is."
1435,If you want really quality wireless your best bet is a good wired headset and a bluetooth dac/amp like the fiio btr5 or one of shanlings options.   For built in wireless though I think the best in that price range is probably a hifiman deva (or the bt version of the Ananda if you want to jump up in price)
1436,">If you want really quality wireless your best bet is a good wired headset and a bluetooth dac/amp like the fiio btr5 or one of shanlings options.   How would that work when there is a 1m+ long cable? I mean where does that go, how do you ""convert"" I guess a wired to a wireless?"
1437,I use a small velcro cable tie to wrap it up and then the btr5 either goes in my pocket or it has a clip so I can just clip it on my shirt or even the headband when I don't care about looking like a middle aged dad with a tiny cell phone holster. Def works best with headphones that have replaceable cables so you can get a shorter cable.   The deva/ananda has a much cleaner setup and also works as a wired headphone
1438,Can confirm the btr5 with my hifiman he4xx is FAR better than any Bluetooth headphones ive heard. I usually just run the cable under my shirt and stick it in my pocket. As far as “conversion” you just make sure the battery is charged and the device is connected to your source and you plug your headphones in. Thats it. The btr5 comes with a little case with a clip on it so you can also clip it to a belt or your pants or whatever
1439,"If you have a nice set of IEMs or headphones with a replaceable cable, you can invest in a good short cable. I prefer the radsone es100 to the btr5, it can power up to my Audeze LCD-2s with ease"
1440,"As an alternative, if your headphones have an removable cable you can buy short one, or have one made for you new or mod your original one. Combine that with Qudelix 5K which is about half the weight(weighs around 25 grams if i recall correctly) and has better features than btr5, and you can clip it on the headband. Wont win you any fashion shows, but you get great sq from it, very functional and plenty alternative uses for the 5k."
1441,"Best Bluetooth set I have heard is AirPods Max, but they really are only an option if you are already on iOS.  Supposedly the 800$ bang and olufsen h95 are top notch as well."
1442,"Audeze Penrose X for a “headset”.  Planar magnetic drivers. Great sound. Works over 2.4GHz Wireless USB or Bluetooth 5.0. Detachable microphone tuned in collaboration with Shure. Works on every platform.  Downside is just limited range distance for 2.4GHz usage, but I set up my dongle such that it shouldn’t be an issue if I need to move from my desk to the nearby kitchen and stay connected."
1443,"I love my Sony MX1000mk2s I wore them at work for 2 years, 10 hour shifts and listen on the side and they are still champs."
1444,MH751/752 is the best option for headsets
1445,"Sennhesier Momentum 3, Dali IO6 are just 2 that are very good, but there are many more out there."
1446,"I truly recommend the bose qc35ii , they sound great for most audiophiles and in my opinion they are equally or better sounding than the senheisser , I think bose has much better neutral sound overall in my opinion , also they are the most comfortable  ( one of most important things when listening through headphones ) also the anc is stellar and class leading , I can't recomend the sony wh-1000xm3 because I didn't tried them but they're also amazing , I personally have the bose qc35ii and sony wf-1000xm3 , bose - brand new replacement coming soon , sony wf-1000xm3 - repair coming soon , the sony wf-1000xm3 are the best earbuds I ever used , they have top notch anc and impressive sound for their price , they're truly worth it as well , a companion for your high-end headphones"
1447,I'm surprised no one mentioned the Audeze Mobius yet.
1448,mostly because they are expensive compared to other headphones and mobius are decent but are nowhere near as good as the competition.
1449,Sony xm4s
1450,It depends on how you like the sound. XM4 have a heavy bass.
1451,HIFIMAN Ananda is for sure. It really sounds better and gives some quality bass compared to the wired Arya [wired arya](https://intoptrend.com/best-headphones-reddit-2021/).
1452,"175-U is progs shit because I've never heard of that name before, Senny budget options in general are garbage.  You could get fiio btr3 adapter to make any pair of headphones wireless, but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.  I'd personally just get akg k371BT, because anything better than that is a waste of money imo. Bose qc35 if you need ANC."
1453,"The 175-U is ~$300, does that count as budget still?  >but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.  Yeah I'm aware of that, but I'm just getting annoyed by cables lol. And since I switched to an HD 598 I don't really wanna go back to a general gaming headset quality, cause it's such a downgrade when listening to music  But either way, !thanks for the suggestions:D"
1454,"> You could get fiio btr3 adapter to make any pair of headphones wireless, but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.  Would this be a good option for gaming or is the delay worse than having a RF wireless headset/headphones"
1455,"Sony MDR-V6. They've been the broadcasting standards for years, super tight bass. Will last forever, at least until the foam ear surrounds will distenigrate, but are available aftermarket. Best headphones you can get hand's down for < $100. Can't recommend enough. I've had cans costing 100's more (Senns, AKGs, etc). While all great headphone they all have their plus and minuses but you love the V6. Check amazon, as they are getting difficult to find elsewhere. You can thank me later ;) after you've seen them, carefully watch sporting event's, you'll notice almost everyone using them, great response, fairly flat, fit on the ear/ slightly over the ear w/40mm drivers, etc. https://www.cnet.com/products/sony-mdrv6/review/ , https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6, you get the gist. There's now various other variations, you can't go wrong with them. "
1456,"I haven't tried these, but Sony audio is wildly underrated. "
1457,Only now so cause people forget the before playstatuon got huge they were a major player in stereo's and tv's. The fact that they dont make tons of money for sony doesnt help. Though this has happened with all high end electronics. Your sony surround sound from 80's/90's is still running golden probably.
1458,[Audio Technica ATH-M50x](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/99aff89488ddd6b1/)  Over ear professional studio monitors.   [Here they are being used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZweyIKNwX4) in Paramores music video.
1459,The M40x are almost as good and are something like $100 (I paid £70 in UK) 
1460,"> Audio Technica ATH-M50x  This absolutely. Really well made, super sturdy and comfy. Great sound for the price. I utterly love mine. Use them for work (video editing), for commuting, at home hooked up to Hifi. Unless you are going to invest big money in proper audiophile stuff you really can't go wrong with these. "
1461,"I'm listening to music with these on the bus as we speak. As a DJ, these are amazing headphones and extremely comfortable for long periods of use. Sometimes DJing for 6 hours takes a toll. I bought the limited edition blue and beige ones for $200 CAD, That's a steal tbh. Seinheisers are a good alternative but the M50X's have done me well"
1462,I'd say ATH M30Xs. The 50s are like 120-150$. The m30x are a great pair to start with because they are around 70$
1463,Another vote for the DT880. A step up from the 770's in price though and quality.
1464,I love my DT990 pro.  But i think its not all about headphones. If you want to use them on a PC you definitley need a sound card or desk amp
1465,Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro - best Headphones I've ever owned. Like wearing plushy clouds over your ears that make everything you thought sounded good sound at least 10 times better.
1466,"I'm not kidding, Grado 60  Get started   http://gradolabs.com/headphones/prestige-series  They're open-ear so you should only use them at home and if your mom asks if you're damaging your hearing, tell her to get lost.  http://gradolabs.com/headphones/prestige-series/item/2-sr60e  I wish I had my Grado 80's but my dog chewed all the earmuffs off and then my girlfriend kicked me out."
1467,"I came here to say this. I did a little freelance work for a friend who insisted that I charged too little, and gave me a pair of 60s as a tip. I thought I knew ""good sound,"" and immediately after using the Grados, realized I had no idea, now I can't go back. 10/10. "
1468,"These were my starters. Agreed. I got some Audio Technicas for the office, but still prefer these."
1469,>I wish I had my Grado 80's but my dog chewed all the earmuffs off and then my girlfriend kicked me out.   lol what  
1470,"nah, but when I first bought some Grado's I did live with my mom and she thought I was blasting my ears out but open-air headphones are different and unusual "
1471,"I was using a pair of Sennheiser PC 360's and it's like being hugged around the heady by a teddy bear.  Recently picked up a pair of Audiotechnica ATH-M70x's and that's more like a leather pillow on each ear.  The Grado's stock foam cushions were too abrasive, and if it was humid at all my ears just became a swamp.  That'll probably be true of the M70x's, too, but they're still easier on the ears overall.  (Better sound, too, but also like 4x more expensive than Grados)  "
1472,Sony MDR-7506. Workhorse of the industry. 
1473,Exactly. Any Sony MDR-V6 variant just kick ass. See my comments above
1474,"I use these every day during work and I adore them. I started with Audio Technica headphones but my giant melon was too big for them. The Sony pair fits great, sounds awesome. Pretty cheap too!   I'm not really an audiophile though, just a programmer who loves listening to music while working. "
1475,Sennheiser HD280's! I make music professionally. I also use them when I workout. The sound is crystal clear. My only complaint is the ear muffs are a bit heavy during hot weather.
1476,"Absolutely, and the best part is you can usually find a decent pair of Sennheiser headphones for <$50. I've gotten two different pairs on Amazon, and often you can find older models (or last years) at a very good price."
1477,"Sennheiser Hd 558. Every couple months theyre discounted to $70-$80 on amazon, get them then."
1478,They're currently on discount at Best Buy.  [Link](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/sennheiser-audiophile-over-the-ear-headphones-titan/1700513.p?skuId=1700513)
1479,"Sennheiser HD 280 pro   I had my first pair for 7 years. I got the same exact model when those broke down, as in the aux plug got bent. Little did I know before I ordered my new pair that they were actually designed to be fixed if need be. They are super durable, comfortable, great natural outside noise insulator (I rarely have volume set to over 30%), they're like x-ray vision in video games like CS:GO, friends have reported hearing things in songs they've never heard before. They're studio headphones so you don't get added bass (which I prefer) and the cable can be ornery but they are excellent and sound like $250+ phones for $100. They last and last and last!"
1480,Don't know much about over the ear but Sennheiser was the best set of quality earbuds I've ever had. Asymmetrical cord was weird tho. 
1481,"Sony MDR-7506. Cheaper than the ATH-M50x, and just as good, if not better."
1482,AKG K-240s are a great pair of headphones that won't break the bank.
1483,240's are also great performing can for the money. +1
1484,AKG Y50
1485,Got the Y50BTs for free with my phone. Love them!
1486,Audio Technica ATH-MSR7GM...Current headphone for about two years now.  Love em!  
1487,"Something by Audio Technica. They are very high quality headphones for a reasonable price. If you are buying a cheaper pair, get OPEN headphones. They will benefit from the airflow better. Only buy closed if you are worried about sound getting out, or you are buying professional quality headphones."
1488,Professional quality? Almost all high-level headphones are open past $300. Really I can only think of the Fostex TH-X00 as closed above that.
1489,"/r/headphones: Senn HD650 + Schiit stack, easily over 500$"
1490,I've got a pair of Koss Pro4AA that I dig. They completely cover the ear and provide for some really chunky and uninterrupted grooves to reach the ear holes.
1491,"Philips SHL3060BK. Very solid, good price."
1492,for earbuds - V-moda zincs.
1493,"I've been a JVC advocate for a few years now.   I'm on my 4th pair now and they have on a consistent basis been high quality and long lasting... and comfortable to wear.   my current set is a JVC HA-RX900. Theyre a little big but theyre immensely comfy, are pretty well soundproofed and the quality is better than anything else I've ever owned.   £60. my previous JVC pairs came closer to £10-£20 range, but they were pretty nice too... these ones are by far the best ive had though"
1494,Koss porta pro ---- 30$ and sounds better than most 150$ headphones. Those who really know headphones will have a set of these. 
1495,"V-moda m100 crossfades, but get the bigger ear cushions. "
1496,"I like Bose. Good response, clear sound, and a noise canceling system that can kill most any annoying sound. Expensive though.   Sony makes a really nice headphone, I had NC7s and NC8s for a while, and some headphones I liked but forgot the model number of. As I'm typing this, I'm using some MDR-ZX110NCs. No complaints.  Beats are overpriced, overrated, and anything else can most likely outperform it.  When I used to volunteer as a sound designer, we had a set of some Audio Technicas that I never had any problems with, whether I was running mic check or just using 100k worth of audio equipment to play Blink-182.   But seriously, a good set of Sony headphones will serve you well for audiophile use. Audio engineering, see this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6sjh0r/audiophiles_of_reddit_what_headphones_would_you/dld9hbt/  I'n almost sure that's what we used, and they worked amazingly."
1497,"I got HD 598s, have found them to be way more comfortable than M50s"
1498,Sennheiser HD 650 4lyf.  Best sounding headphones I've ever owned.
1499,"Sony Dynamic Stereo Headphones, MDR-7506"
1500,Check out the most admired and desired headphone in budget segment since its existence - Sennheiser CX180  http://okreviewed.com/sennheiser-cx-180-street-ii-in-ear-headphone-review/  
1501,I  use Shure in ear headphones for monitoring and for he sound isolation properties during other things. The combination of the sound isolation and the better quality audio made me rewatch a lot of movies and see what I am missing withoutnoutside distractions. I would highly recommend the se315 or se415 if you are just starting. 
1502,Audio technica ATH-M30x/M40x etc or the Sennheiser HD 559
1503,Koss UR-20.
1504,Just bought CB-1 they are cheap and has great reviews. Check it out

1506,"I dont know if they are country wide or just local to my state, but I have Skullcandy ear buds. They are phenomenal. The pair I usually buy are around 25 bucks(depending), sound amazing and can take a beating. I have washed them, dunked them in water and Mt Dew, put them through some touch conditions. I dont think I have ever had a pair short out on me and the only time they have ever broken was when they got caught in my door and snapped. I seriously cant praise them enough. The best part is, they come with a manufactures warranty that if something does happen to them, you can send them in and exchange them. At least that is how they were. I have never had to, so I dont know if they do it anymore or not. "
1507,"Huh, who knew. I honestly dont care. Upvotes and downvotes mean nothing, I am just here for conversation.   Earbuds are headphones in my eyes. They go in my ear and I can listen to music. I cant stand on-head headphones. They are to bulky and I cant store them anywhere. they would be just one more thing for me to carry.   But a few things to note here. 1. Skullcandy are by far the best that I have ever owned. You can map out my entire life by what pair of headphones I had at any given time. Ill admit, headphone technology has come along way since the early 90's and the quality has gotten better and better, But I have never had a pair of headphones last through what I can put Skullcandies through, nor have I had a pair that can match their quality of sound, especially for earbuds. I have owned them all, Sony, Bose, JVC, Philips, AKG, Razor for my gaming, the list goes on. (and can we please not talk about Beats by DRE, my god) They were like shoes to me. Give them six months to a year, and they would short out, break, or just simply fall apart at the seams. I have had the same pair of SC for over two years now. I dont really need to go on about this 2. I am poor. 20-30 bucks is a luxury to me. So that two years of not buying another pair of headphones has saved me a lot of money. I could never justify buying headphones that costed as much as you mentioned. That is another reason why I stick to them. Even at their cheapest pair,($15) the quality of sound and materials is phenomenal compared to other brands you can get at that price.   Now, I am an open person. Im willing to try out something new. Give me some brands you would recommend and I will check them out. If you can give me something better than SC, I will erase everything I have said. "
1508,Thanks for the heads up. I'll be sure to visit it when I want to upgrade or need to replace. I just ordered these: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HVLUR18/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Heard nothing but good reviews and I know the bran is up there with the best. 
1509,Low cost? Monoprice has surprised me with their quality / cost ratio.  Consider these:  http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=108&cp_id=10823&cs_id=1082302&p_id=8323&seq=1&format=2
1510,"Absolutely this, the Monoprice 8323's are excellent headphones. You'll have a hard time finding anything under $150 that comes close, and these are only $25.  Also, http://www.cnet.com/news/how-good-can-21-59-headphones-be/"
1511,"Based on my experience with other Monoprice products, this guy is definitely on to something."
1512,"Have a look at Superlux - They make REALLY good headphones, that cost next to nothing.  EDIT: [Thomann.de](http://www.thomann.de/gb/superlux_headphones.html) has them. I assume you're in the UK?"
1513,"They're incredibly cheap, and they sound bloody amazing. I have two different ones, the HD 669 (closed) which sound almost just as good as my old AKG K240's, and I have HD 681F (semi-open) that also sound really good (not as good as the HD 669).  Every person I've lured into buying them were floored by the price/performace factor.  At around/under €30 they are unbeatable."
1514,"They are great, just got a pair of 668B from Amazon. Great quality neutral sound for the price"
1515,Audio Technica M50s 
1516,I started with audio technica several years ago.  I've upgraded to the ath-anc7b now.  They make excellent headphones for the price. 
1517,[The Headphone List](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone-review-list/) agrees with you assuming a ~$100 budget. For under $70 looks like a Koss Pro DJ100 or Superlux HD668B. 
1518,"If you can, spend the extra bit for the M50x. Having a detachable cord is soooo nice :) I have one for my desktop and use the other two that it comes with for my iphone. "
1519,"I have ATH-M50s and they are fantastic, but I recommend buying [these](http://www.amazon.com/Shure-HPAEC840-Replacement-Cushions-Headphones/dp/B002Z9JWZS) pads along with them. The stock pads are extremely uncomfortable, but with the Shure's I can easily listen to an entire album without adjusting them at all."
1520,Sony mdr7506 or mdr v6 are what I use. The 7506 are much punchier with the bass and fit somewhat tightly. The v6 is like wearing a pillow and has a nice warm sound. Neither costs more than eighty bucks I think. I'm not sure since these pairs must be around 15 years old or something.
1521,"+1 for v6! keep in mind that the v6 are meant to be accurate, not boomy, so the low end might not be what you're expecting. you'll hear parts of favorite songs you didn't even know were there."
1522,"I was going to say.. There's a bunch of Sonys from $50-80 just as good/better than ""beats"" or something."
1523,"if he's going way low budget I love my MDR-V300's. It's an older model, but they fit well on me and the sound quality is good enough for my needs."
1524,MDR-V6 gets my vote.
1525,Grado SR-60 is just barely over your budget and are fantastic.  
1526,"I had the Panasonic RP-HTX7-G1 for a while and they were good, at least for me, not sure about you. They are extremely durable and quite cheap I think."
1527,"I have similar, if not identical cans. I've had them for years and they show few signs of giving up anytime soon. I've abused them somewhat, but the sound quality is still great. I'll definitely check out Panasonics the next time I need cans."
1528,Monoprice
1529,"I've heard good things about these and they're around $24   http://www.monoprice.com/Product?seq=1&format=2&p_id=8323&CAWELAID=1329456795&CAGPSPN=pla&gclid=CN-H_oP7_r8CFQgLaQodxmUANw  Or you can go with the Koss Pro dj200, but they're at the top of your price range. The dj100's are a bit cheaper at around $43  Pro dj200 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007CNC79A?cache=ee57acead43cbe42fbd7bae7efe6aaab&pi=SY200_QL40&qid=1407339309&sr=8-2#ref=mp_s_a_1_2  Prodj100  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003X1BEKI?cache=ee57acead43cbe42fbd7bae7efe6aaab&pi=SY200_QL40&qid=1407339309&sr=8-1#ref=mp_s_a_1_1"
1530,"Sennheiser HD-201. I'm a musician and engineer and use them a lot. They're not entirely acoustically ""flat"" but they live in a place where build quality, design, sound quality and price meet up in a sweet spot.   http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B0007XJSQC?pc_redir=1407217490&robot_redir=1  "
1531,I second these.  I've been consistently buying Sennheiser HD-201's for years.
1532,"Came here to say Sennheiser HD-201, and yes, they have good sound, and can be obtained for about 30 dollars' worth of your local currency.  I've had two pairs, and the first pair only stopped being used because I broke the plastic. The headphones would still work otherwise.  Good, solid, and cheap headphones. "
1533,"[Koss Porta Pro Dark Master](https://www.google.dk/search?q=Koss+Porta+Pro+Dark+Master&safe=off&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=uH3iU8bRGOLiywOY8IGQBw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1066&bih=708)  Extremely good quality, really affordable  I really recommend these!"
1534,"Not over ear but I join the praise. This set is amazing for its price as long as you don't mind pinching some hair with the band on occasion.  It is a very good set. There is a version with an in line mic but I don't have that. It is essentially unchanged for decades.  I can also join previous recommendations on the sennheisers and Sony sets as well as the ath-m50 which is a bit over budget but you cab sometimes find good deals. Also on Amazon.  I splurged on v-moda m100 recently but 70 USD will get you a good pair.  At this price I also recommend looking at AKG cans as well as the German Teufel, but the latter isn't to my own taste. Others recommend it."
1535,"This question pops up frequently and I hope people look into these  The KOSS PORTA PRO is my absolute pick. I also listen to a LOT of what I call ""sweet spot"" music and these always come through (the subtle parts of production are too often lost) not with the Koss. There is no noise cancelling and though they are over ear there is ambient sounds coming through but they never disappoint.   As I've said in other forums I have bought over 20 pair of these over the years and gifted them to friends with many big smiles. They used to have lifetime guaranty but I'm not sure what current policy is (I have sent damaged ones in with $5.00 and had them returned like new. About $40.00 online(amazon)? or where you can find the. Great for travel cause they fold nicely.  Do your ears a favor, they will surprise you. "
1536,I enjoy the Beyerdynamic stuff.. check it out
1537,"JVC Etremes. I went on Amazon when I wanted to buy a new pair of earphones, sorted by 'top rated' at the time. These come top out of around 5000 listings. I always assumed JVC to be a crappy brand til I got these I love them! I love electro music and they blast so much bass. On sale for around £12 aswell! Great value.   http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B004S7Q8CA/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1407339667&sr=8-1&pi=SX200_QL40"
1538,Meelec. Best bang for your budget. 
1539,"I mean they are a bit expensive, but I absolutely love my Sony MDR-7506 headphones. They're 200% comfortable and absolutely great quality. $100 might seem expensive now, but they're an investment. "
1540,Beats by Dre.....ok I can't even post that seriously.
1541,Don't forget skullcandy ;)
1542,"AKG K 518 LE  ~ £30 - fold up super small, hinges and headband don't break and can be used to DJ in clubs.  edit: I presume by over ear you meant ""not in ear"" not circumaural. (in my opinion supra-aural is better anyway)"
1543,"I dont know what you mean by bass heaviness associated with JVC, but i really love my JVC HAR 900s with a few minor mods that just reduce the bleeding and sound dampening. Im never getting another pair of headphones."
1544,Klipsch S4i or S4ii if you want to spend a little more money. Best headphones for the money!
1545,NVX XPT100
1546,"Looks like you already bought, but [these](http://www.amazon.com/Rocketfish-RF-NCHP01-Atoms-Noise-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B006RBDEW2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407342722&sr=8-1&keywords=rocketfish+atmos) are great headphones for the price.  I used to work for the company that makes them (which is part of Best Buy) and private label products like this are very hit or miss.  In this case, it was a huge hit.  The engineers that worked on the design and testing in Minneapolis were very high on flat, authentic sound reproduction.  They're discontinued these days but still available on Amazon."
1547,"Sennheiser HD-19's  70 bucks, in FYE"
1548,Koss Porta Pro  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B00001P4ZH/
1549,I have some Numark red wave DJ headphones. I got them on sale for $45 and they are easily the best headphones I've ever used. 
1550,I'm really surprised no one has mentioned   Samson SR850  http://www.head-fi.org/t/546544/samson-sr850-superlux-oem-review-a-50-budget-champion
1551,"Before I actually started browsing Amazon.com I would have recommended the AKG k514 MKII. They are clear and airy. Decent highs and lows, but they shine in the middle. If you listened to bass heavy genres you would have found them lacking but if you want clear vocals and acoustics these are the phones for you. As an added bonus of the many budget headphones that have passed through me these are by far the most comfortable to wear.They are currently on sale for $67.95  on Amazon.com   Now - just buy AKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphones, on sale for $68.29(from $159.00). These are considered one of the best semi-professional headphones for under $200 and the fact that you can get them for $70 is just mind-boggling."
1552,I've found that Sennheisers are great.  Lots of models to choose from.  Excellent sound for the money.
1553,"MDR ZX-100 is what I am using now, and they have a  really nice sound and fit well for the price. They cost 20$ US (I've seen them in Canada for 30$ plus tax before) plus tax, but go on sale sometimes for less."
1554,just doubling up on the [Sony MDR-V6](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDRV6-Studio-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00001WRSJ) reccomendation!
1555,Sony MDR-7506's are great headphones.  They are quite frequently used in studios and are fantastic sound quality with a great flat response.  Really reliable and durable as well.
1556,AKG K240 if you're ok with semi-open cans. Very nice organic sound. 
1557,"TASCAM TH-02. I got mine for $27 (including tax and shipping).   Extremely satisfactory, except for discomfort after extended use."
1558,[The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/headphones/) has already done all of this research for you. I find their recommendations to be spot on.
1559,"Meelectronic M6's, $17.99.  Theyr'e also clear, which is pretty cool http://www.amazon.com/MEElectronics-Sport-Fi-Noise-Isolating-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0038W0K2U"
1560,ATH-M50s.  (Audio Technica)
1561,"I don't remember what the economic theory is, but it was talking about how the rich stay rich because they don't have to spend as much money.  A good pair of boots costs $50 (this was from a long time ago...) and would last several years.  A cheap pair of boots costs $10, and after a couple of months the cardboard would wear out and your feet would get all wet in the rain.  Workers can't afford good boots, so they have to buy cheap boots.  Since they buy cheap boots, they have to be replaced every few months.  A poor person buys 10 pairs of cheap boots in the time a wealthy person only has to buy the one pair of good boots.  The same works for food - the poor person buying low quality fast food pays less per meal than the rich person buying high quality groceries or going to nice restaurants, but the poor person has much more health problems related to their diet, and probably worse insurance, if any, so they pay way more for health care / lose money from time off being sick.  tl;ldr - put the few extra bucks down for some Audio Technica ATH-M50s"
1562,"I found Aviators to personally sound better and be more comfortable, albeit a bit more expensive ($40? vs $80)"
1563,If you can go over that budget settle for something like Sennheiser HD800s[HD800s](https://intoptrend.com/best-headphones-reddit-2021/). These are better sounding headphones and for sure you can gain a lot more if you are using an amp.
1564,something something monoprice headphones.
1565,"I would tend to agree, overall. When I recommend that people buy (circumaural) headphones, I tend to advice them to spend in a $200-400 range, which tends to cover both the holy triumvirate and a number of very solid mid-end options (Mad Dogs, Focals, a number of quite competent Audio-Technicas, etc), including room for an amp with most of the headphones that require one. Indeed, I wrote a big ol' wall of text a while back justifying quality headphones based on price/hour of listening specifically to validate the $200-400 range to folks with doubts.  I think that IEMs might range just a bit more, perhaps - maybe $100-200, since that ranges from the really solid price/performance $100ish options (SE215, RHA M750i, VC1000,) to the cheaper end of the high end (DN-1000, Custom Art Music One), but that's just me."
1566,"Aye! Though what bugs me about the Focals is that they are closer to a portable headphone design in size than a full-size headphone design. They have quite heavy cables though, suggesting they really are intended as desktop headphones ostensibly for audio monitoring. I haven't worn them for any long period of time though - are they comfortable for long periods compared to other full sized closed backs? (DT770, 1540, Z7, etc.)"
1567,"I can attest to them from personal experience, and they do have issues with comfort -- their cup size must be designed for French folks because they don't fit me (and since I'm pretty average, i suspect a bunch of other folks) well.    But to be fair I must also add that the Spirit Pro has one of the most unique looks of any headphone I have seen, with the spackled paint finish that looks remarkably like [the headphones are wet] (http://medias.audiofanzine.com/images/normal/719797.jpg). IMO pictures dont do it justice, you have to see it in real life to get a sense of how gorgeous it is."
1568,"Hey Lachlan,  I have the Spirit One S I just picked up not too long ago. Although I have not tried any of the headphones you listed above, the Focals are not all that comfortable. It is not a problem for me since I never have headphones on for over an hour at a time so it's forgivable but for people who have them on for hours at a time should look elsewhere. I also have quite thick frames on my glasses and I did notice a slight bass leak due to the smaller cups and tighter clamping force but it's definitely something minor and doesn't detract from the overall listening experience imo. Ymmv."
1569,"Picked up my Shure SE535s for $300 up here in Canada :) And my DT990 Pros for $150. :) Definitely can be deals to had, just not as many as you lucky bastards. ;)"
1570,> Picked up my Shure SE535s for $300 up here in Canada  London Drugs?  They stopped stocking se535s. They were only getting rid of their last stock at $300.
1571,The deals we get up here are few and far between unfortunately :( Lots of equipment cost almost double here than the US. I got my HD650s for around $500 CAD where down south can be had for under $300.. Guess it comes down to supply and demand.
1572,"Not sure if they are still there but I ordered a pair of KEF M500's for 200cad...  I reallllly enjoy them,  insane for the price.  "
1573,"The trick in Canada is living next to the border.  Ogdensburg, NY is an hour drive away from me and I can get a packaged shipped to a holding place there for around $5. Still have to pay gas and duty but still better than the crazy high prices from Canadian retailers.  Unfortunately right now it's not that advantageous because of the abysmally low Canadian dollar. :("
1574,"Paid 99$ for my Q701 and 150 for my HE-300. I also nabbed that Pre-order from vsonic which includes an earphone with a gr07 driver for 40$. As a Canadian,  the sweet spot is in patience.  I also got those Shure 940s for 90$. And had a pair or Focal pro's and Focal Spirit ones,  both which I paid less than 200 for.   If I had to name a price though I'd say the sweet spot is 200. You can get a Q701,  or AD900 for under 200 anywhere I the world if you buy used, sometimes it can be had new.  In terms of Iems you get can get some great stuff for under 150  including the GR07 and RE400."
1575,Computer lounge. Currently it is not possible to get hifiman in NZ though. And they were only that price because it was the last pair of the last bit of stock they had before all the hifiman gear sold out. They won't be getting more..... 
1576,">  it is not possible to get hifiman in NZ thoug  thanks for the reply.  That's a shame, I really want to get my hands on some hifiman. Guess I'll have to wait for either Massdrop or go with amazon. :x "
1577,"Are you in nz? If so which part? The 400nzd cap really kills it though, even if you get a used he400 for say 250usd you may get slammed with customs/import tax when you include shipping. If you have a chance to go to china or have friends visiting, yiu can pick them uo cheap there. He400i is like 350usd in china! And one user on here got a used demo unit from CL for 500nzd which i dont think was a good deal as thats how much i paid for mine new. When they did advertise them in stock on their website and in store, before they were closing out hifiman due to discontinuation he500s were going for 1200nzd, he-6 were 1800-1900nzd....."
1578,"I have a friend that works at an audio store who calls me up before any good deals make it to the shelf. These were NOS, made in Austria. The initial part of my comment was to show that Canadians CAN get deals. My 'sweet spot' was adjusted to based on prices I'd seen in stores for new products.  For example, the Q701 regular price is 189 on US Amazon."
1579,"> Paid 99$ for my Q701   what is that in US$ at todays exchange rate? $20? :-)  But seriously, that is an incredible deal for the Q701, and up there with the best steals I have heard of this year"
1580,"I personally think $100-$250, that's a broad range, but I think that's where you get the best value before serious diminishing returns kick in.   You have some great IEMs from Shure, RHA, etc., some great open cans with the Fidelios, AKG K7s (a lot of them), Sennheisers up to a used 650, etc., and some similarly great closed cans.   I couldn't personally justify buying any headphones more expensive, but that's just me. I've auditioned the HD800, and it's a great set of headphones, but I don't think it's 7x better than my K7XXs. Same with anything from Audeze. "
1581,$300-500  That's where HD600 is :P
1582,"Trust me I am VERY aware of that. It is very difficult to choose just one once I move to TOTLs, which I'll be doing in the next few months. This is a transistionary period. Sadly this isn't even the whole collection either. Too many odds and ends I'm in the process of eliminating. At the end I need one very good closed back for work and a stunning open back for home. So far it's looking like the HD800 may just be the next upgrade as everyone seems to call the Q701 the poor man's HD800 "
1583,> the Q701 the poor man's HD800  they do? Because it's not :-)
1584,I've got the K702's and HD 800's. The K702's are definitely not the poor man's HD 800.
1585,I'd be very interested in some comparison thoughts if you could give some. I still haven't gotten the chance to hear an 800 yet but am extremely familiar with the sound of the K701/K702
1586,"I have a hard time saying ER4s are neutral honestly, they're very unique to say the least."
1587,"They certainly measure well, but their actual sound is very unique.    Generally neutral means nothing is emphasized and nothing is recessed, but I've never experienced that with the ER4s, mainly because they sound extremely bright and have some huge bass response variance (some notes hit nicely and some are almost not there) that make them not quite neutral in my opinion.  Yes I've had them unamped and ""properly"" amped as well.    I think what the ER4s do better than anything is analyze the music.  You really can hear everything, nothing is obscured, but there is also almost nothing musical about the sound.  Maybe thats neutral to some people, but I can't really say I agree."
1588,Jeez I wish Canada had prices like that. The hd600 cost $500 in amazon and that is with $100 off
1589,Right now the HD600 is $245 on Newegg though. 
1590,i paid $270 for my q701 so i think around that price range. saw the fidelio x2 going for 299 and sorely tempted
1591,I agree. Q701 is a pretty good choice in terms of open-back with detachable cable. :)
1592,How about an HE-400i for an ortho sweet spot? 
1593,I think they're definitely the ortho sweet spot for brand new cans. I'd much rather a NFB-15 + HE400i over a HE560 tbh.
1594,"I agree with your point about encouraging people to make a smaller purchase to get their feet wet, actually. Specifically I find that for some high end gear, while it may sound great to the right listener, can be utterly offensive to anyone else. Everyone raves about the Beyer dt1350 but I found it to have textureless 'sausage slapping' bass, bodyless mids, piercing highs and terrible sound separation/soundstage. I find that cheaper, value oriented products are usually tuned to have a much more 'inoffensive' sound that they can be easily enjoyed by almost anyone, no matter their tastes for sound.  I also disagree with the criticism that this cheaper gear gets thrown away when the user inevitably upgrades. I still have my PL50s and my Clip Zip, the first pieces of specialty audio equipment that I purchased, and I still make regular use of them. Other entry level headphones (though maybe not so much IEMs) can become handmedows to friends or family who you would like to introduce to the hobby, or even modding playgrounds to show you exactly what makes a headphone sound the way it sounds, and give you an opportunity to tune them to your own two ears in a way that no manufacturer ever could."
1595,"I think there's a lack of ""failsafe"" options in the closed full-sized market compared to other types. Not everyone will like how bassy the DT770 is, or how the A900x fits, or the treble presentation of the MDR-Z7 for example.   It gets more dependent on your tonal balance preferences, since IME most closed-backs on the market sound very different to each other. It's not like the HD600 / K7-- / DT880 which don't sound drastically different from one another."
1596,"I would say around $50-80 for IEMs, and $100-200 for headphones. Though certaintly not the best, the vsd5s can be had for $69, and the Sennheiser HD598 is for $150 on amazon (same price as my AKG612pros), so I would say thats a pretty good setup.   For headphones the massdrop K7XXX is a steal at $200, and though certainty not 'endgame', is pretty far up there. I A/B'ed my AKG612 with an HD800 and while the latter is much more resolving and clear, the difference isnt worth the $1000+ premium (and I was using a Sennheiser HDVD800!)"
1597,"In my opinion, I think ...... 1) IEM's that are around $100-$200 range have excellent value ie. VSonic GR07, Klipsch Image S4ii/X10 2) Portable headphones around the $200-$350 range ie. NAD Viso HP50, Sennheiser Momentum Over-Ear, Philips Fidelio line 3) Headphones for home-use in the $300-$400 range ie. Sennheiser HD600/650, Philips Fidelio X2"
1598,"I think 300-400 gets pretty damn good open backs and 200-300 for closed backs. Many cans in their respective categories are at the pinnacle of diminishing returns in those price points. I feel like HD25s for 200usd or there abouts is pretty good for portable on ears too. Also lachlan, you should check out the audio technica a900x if you ever get a chance! "
1599,"One thing to keep in mind though, is how many of the full sized headphones you mentioned would need, or at least benefit form an amplifier. This adds $100-300 to the overall price. Still a good point, but it may be easier to swallow getting full sized headphones in the $100-200 range that don't need an amp.  I do fully agree with you though. I recently bought VSD3S, and some HD558's. Can't imagine ""upgrading"" from these for a few years, and my next investment is going to need an amp, and fairly pricey headphones, probably $500+ total easy."
1600,"agreed for IEMs, $200 for portables because that's where the NAD is, and $200 for full sized because that's where the AKG k7s and hd580/used hd600s are. worst value imo are portables and best value would be a tie between $100 IEMs and low $200 full size headphones."
1601,"It's difficult to determine a ""sweet spot"" for audio gear, since everyone's disposable income are different and vary widely, individually.   I'm a bargain hunter for quality goods. I picked up most of my headphones and IEMs at big discounted prices, but I don't merely buy any and all gear that goes on sale... it has to be to my preferences and liking. For example, no matter how many times ""deals"" pop up for the over-hyped M50X, I'm not going to buy it.  Some of my favorites include the legendary sale of Ultimate Ears TF10 for $95 four years ago, Monster Miles Davis Tribute for $130, Audio-Technica A900X for $106, Audio-Technica ESW9A for $109, Sennheiser HD700 for $325, etc. Gifted Klipsch X10 for $85 and Sennheiser HD598 for $99.   I guess my personal ""sweet spot"" for good headphones and IEMs is $80-$150. However, if I find a killer deal for an item I really want, like HD700 for $325, I'm going to go above my ""sweet spot"" and try my best to acquire it.   Most friends and relatives of mine think I'm crazy for spending so much on audio gear, but they don't realize how much more other audiophiles are willing to spend. Some people don't blink an eye dropping hundreds and thousands on hi-fi and summit-fi gear. I'm personally not crazy or wealthy enough to do that (yet).   I think the vast majority of the general public wouldn't spend more than $100 on headphones and IEMs. Unless of course, it's for superficial reasons like getting Beats as a necklace to look cool in public. But I think even hipsters realize these days that Beats are ripoffs and word has spread that spending so much for crappy - mediocre sound quality is just stupid.  P.S. Keep up the good work on your videos, Lachlan. I hope you buy the HD700 someday and do a proper review (with a good tube amp) for it. :)"
1602,"As to closed, full size headphones, you have to consider the AKG K550's currently retailing in the $200-$250 range and an excellent example of fairly neutral sounding closed headphones with a pretty decent soundstage.  Their only downside is obtaining a good seal for good bass if you have a small head.  If you have a normal or large head or if you add the Alpha Pads for $60 (because you have a small head) you get very adequate bass.  In addition, the stock AKG K550's are very comfortable for closed phones and even more so with the Alpha Pads."
1603,"Nice post OP. I do have to say the HP50 is not a good choice for portable use. While it is a good choice from a technical and sound perspective the headband is very unique and will have people staring. It kind of makes your head look like Frankenstein. If you are punk rock and don't care then all power to you.   For me the real point of being impressed is $350. For this much or less you can buy the HD650 or the HE400i. They are both amazing. With headphones below this I have been impressed but it wasn't like ""oh wow, what am I hearing?"" impressed. I have been so impressed with these cans that I am planning on adding the HD800 this summer (gonna find new for $900) and hopefully then the HE1000 in later 2015 or worse case scenario with my tax return in early 2016.   ;)"
1604,"I realize i'm 3 months late to this topic, but it is one that I have a lot of ambivalence toward:  I entered the headphone market, when generally, the reasonably best of the market was never upward of $1,000 dollars; then the HD800, PS1000, among others were kicked off, and now the hi-fi become mid-fi.  I climbed that ladder, and came back down. While I applaud Sennheiser for having a flagship that came out 5 years ago, what I really came to understand is the market starting to take advantage of consumers. It -really- bugs me that we have companies on both ends of the scale releasing new products much more often then before.  On some part, I have a bias. I don't want to buy a new headphone every year, thinking that somehow mine has become obsolete. AKG is a good example here, as they've really started to ramp up a 55x and 7xx headphone yearly. While I favored some of their more recent headphone's, I did not want to purchase a new headphone in five years, knowing the K732 had just come out.  One thing I do appreciate though from them is sticking to the same headphone design's for these basic models, because on the other end of constant releases, you do have Sennheiser, for example, putting out ghost updates on their headphone's. At the end of the day, the biggest factor that bugs me though lies within the fashion conscious of why headphone companies are releasing different styles to designs that already work.  For example, you have the M70x and MSR7 that just came out (at least to me). Yesterday I had just gotten my hands on a pair of m40x's, and to be honest, the design to me was perfect. It was understated, fit, had replaceable pads, collapsible, a detachable cable. While I hate the sound signature of the likes on the M50x, the design of it, as a closed, efficient portable, should be the likes that other developers copy and paste. And in all honesty, it baffles me that the MSR7 differentiates so much from that design. The plastic is strong enough, but why not just put more metal parts in that stock design?  I'm really getting off-topic here, because there are so many smaller nitpicks in the market.  In regards to the cheaper China headphones flooding the market now, some of them are actually outstanding. The likes of Monoprice, Focal Spirit, Sound Magic, and NAD are all headphones I love the sound of. Going back to the likes of the M50x though, the durability and comfort don't even come close. This is why I like my time tested companies, like Audio Technica, Beyerdynamic, and Sennheiser, since - for the most part - they get comfort. However, now that you Sennheiser trying to appeal to the Beats crowd, I feel like they can't design a competent portable headphone. The Urbanite and Momentum look good, but the sound signature and design do not appeal to the head well. It's like guitars, since the design of a guitar is meant (with good reason) to comply to the sound of the guitar, and not to the user holding the guitar. These headphone's do not apply with comfort. In those cases, i'll choose a speaker (even on quiet) every time.  The second part of why I stick to time-tested companies is user replaceable parts. While I don't think Sennheiser can make a competent, all encompassing closed headphone (and at the moment, i'm doubting many dynamic drivers can), there was a time I contemplated just owning Sennheiser because many of their models offer parts I can replace, instead of trusting a service, or throwing them in the trash. Beyerdynamic does this will some of their models, albeit Beyerdynamic has some glaring reliability issues. I applaud V-Moda and Koss for offering good deals for replacing of upgrading headphones.   In conclusion, for a seemingly simple closed, efficient, comfortable, competent, portable headphone, simply accomplishing the basics is unfounded. The checklist should be making the portable headphone, efficient, comfortable, and durable/replaceable, giving brownie points for a collapsible design; then one should look for applying an appealing sound signature.  Looking back at designs that have tried to capture this market: the M100 and HD 25 both are not comfortable, not with anything i've tried doing with them. The DT770 accomplishes this, no user detachable cable, and a thin sound signature. The 1540 accomplishes this with a slightly wonky and nonportable design. The options are few. The M40x/M50x accomplish this, and to me are the gold standard, despite that I hate the sound signature; they're the holy relic of good design though.  What do I take and recommend off of this? Moddable headphone's. This mostly applies to the closed and/or portable market, because I will recommend the HD600/HD650 to anyone. Personally, I am under the impression fully sealed, dynamic headphones do not work well in that setting, particularly for a neutral, interesting signature, like the HD600. I'm not going to recommend a headphone to anyone that does not have those basics mentioned above though; however, the Monoprice, the T50RP, HD25 (still uncomfortable), the M50X, have a vast arrange of options for modifying their comfort, sound signature, and durability, like their headbands. For example, it always confuses me that AT will put their protein leather headbands their, like on the ESW9 when they start to flake. What Beyer does with a velcro sealed headband, like on some T50RP mods is simple and smart.  The more time I spend with headphones, the more comfort and durability are important to me. The more i'm using uncomfortable headphones, the more compromising I am going to be on a sound signature. It should come warranted that if you want the best, go for the open headphones. There comfort is important, but there are a lot less demands in terms of portability. One should have an open mind for closed, portable headphones, since there will be stuff lost.   It's total bullshit what people are paying now for headphones though. If people are paying for the niche $1,000 headphones though, for the most part, they are paying for future research in cheaper headphones though. To me, with the China crap, I can pay $200 and get a great headphone. I just wish some of the bigger, more reliable manufacturer's picked that up, and spent $100 or $200 extra dollars toward making a good design (or just used the M50x design and made a competent driver). Really, there needs to be more in the $200-$400 dollar range that is fully encompassing, like how that series for open headphones is a template for 90% of what one may be able to fully acquire for open headphones.  /Thanks for incompetent rant"
1605,"If interest is there and money to spend, why not get something nice~   Everyone should have a limit he wants to spend on a headphone. And you can find very solid options in every price bracket and in every category.  So I wouldn't advise someone to buy a 300$ headphone, even though he could spend a ""kilobuck"" on his first pair. You wouldn't buy anything expensive without having a listen before or the option to send the item back anyways (or at least you shouldn't ;))  At least thats my opinion  ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ  Further I think that fullsize-sealed and portable options kinda go together because if you would care for portability you'd go with earphones anyway. I've seen several people walking around with M50s, Dt770s and HD-25s on the streets/bus/train/plane/... None of them overly portable but they seem to work wonderfully."
1606,"edit: nevermind :)  Don't hate on the E100 til you try it!  I didn't have high expectations for it since it was just 12 dollars, but after buying them they have set a new bar for IEMs/Earbuds for me. They crushed all my other earbuds no contest. I used to hate listening on the go since I was used to the sound from my HE-400s. While the E100 aren't as good as the hifimans, the don't make me regret going outside. Very worth trying for 12 dollars.  I'd love to see a video of you reviewing the E100s! (go into it with low expectations and youll be surprised)"
1607,Oh I don't doubt it's good lol. I just think the Baldoor worship is more amusing (and makes sense) in the context of its price. 
1608,"It's less ""worship"" and more ""circlejerk"", really. While the E100 has some fans, most of the people who reference it are making fun of the fuss made over it."
1609,Around $12 for Earbuds
1610,"Depends. I think that there's one fairly sweet spot for iems around $50 (where the Meelec A151, VSD3s etc are significantly better than anything cheaper). Idk about the iems you mentioned. IMO the JVC FXD80 (for less than $70) is almost 90% as good as any of the iems you mentioned. And the westone um3x is definitely a solid step up worthy of the extra money from those iems.   Dunno about headphones. Im about to buy my first pair of DT880 600 ohm in a day or two, glad to hear you think its the sweet spot. I do forsee it as my endgame for atleast the next 5-7 years. I'll upgrade amps and speakers in the mean while."
1611,Tree fiddy
1612,"Oh, did the E100 go on sale? "
1613,"Oh, hey Lachlan 🙋"
1614,"Is Arctis Pro Wireless still the only choice after all these years if I want to connect to two devices simultaneously via wireless and bluetooth?  Honestly I'm not a pro-gamer whatsover who need to hear every pin drop at perfect precision. Being wireless itself is a good enough qol feature to me over many other stuff, as long as I can hear the game sound and voicechat normally.   This is actually coming from an ex-Arctis Pro Wireless user looking for replacement. The transmitter just died suddenly (not recognisible by any console) after ~2 years. I enjoyed the experience, but just not really confident enough in buying the same product again."
1615,"I mean lots can do that they all just suck, including the arctis pro.  The Penrose can also do that."
1616,Does your GSP 370 disconnect like the others? I want to buy one but that DC bug is a deal breaker for me
1617,Will you be adding the new Logitech Pro X Wireless on the list?
1618,It’s no good compared to the G935?
1619,"u/LifelongCaboose would you pin this to the main thread as there's a lot of console wireless questions. I realize you're not a fan of these products, but your work in looking at this and educating people is worth pinning to main page."
1620,"The regular Cloud Flight doesn't have mic monitoring/sidetone, which was a deal breaker for me. Its software is also terrible with no EQ option---nothing besides volume/mute/battery level. Such a shame because I liked it besides that.  The Cloud Flight S is supposed to remedy this by adding sidetone, but it's not clear whether the software will be any better for these. Is there an EQ option that magically appears when you plug in the Flight S instead of the regular Flights? I'm also wary of the complaints about really bad 7.1 sound and white noise, which wasn't present at all on the Cloud Flight."
1621,"I know they're old, but what do you think of the Razer Man O War? I have a set that I'm looking to change out for something else but I really appreciate the wireless factor as I have pet parrots that love chewing on wires. I keep reading that the sound and mic quality are huge problems with so many of these wireless headsets, but I've never had any issues with my headset as far as sound and mic quality. Am I judging from a lack of experience or did they just manage to get it right the one time? If it is just lack of experience, how much better/worse is the one I have than the options you listed here? I've been giving serious thought to the virtuoso but this gives me pause."
1622,The man o war is awful. I'm also removing the Virtuoso from the list as it very bad but the mic rocks. And it's not worth itm  Wait for the Audeze Penrose.
1623,"I can't believe that, after such a long search and finally arriving at this thread, I end up with the knowledge that I've unconsciously chosen the best option... two years ago.  Seriously? For two years nothing better than Cloud Flight appeared on the market?  They're okay for me, good for gaming and voip, but they're missing one thing that'd make them golden: ANC. I tried to use them in open space at the office, and the lack of noise isolation/ANC clearly shows. I can't get back to a wired headset, so I guess I'll just stop searching and accept that there's no wireless headset with ANC and decent mic, which does NOT rely on ancient Bluetooth HSP/HFP."
1624,"Anc isn't good for gaming sadly it's why most companies don't mess with it. It negativity affects not only audio quality but also gaming preformance.  RF wireless is honestly dying.  Bluetooth is so much more advanced and better, it will be the future of wireless. For headsets it is limited for bandwidth for a good mic."
1625,Bluetooth focuses on audio quality first. Mic quality second.  2.4GHz wireless has similar issues and limitations which it's why audio quality is never great and mic quality always sucks.  Bluetooth Atleast leans to what's important. Gaming company's kinda half ass both.
1626,"What about bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL?  Is there anything good out there in the price range you explored within your guide?  I was considering to get a creative BT-W2 to plug in my pc plus a pair of headphones that could benefit from that (I already have a stand alone mic for discord chats).    Still not sure what to pick, I always used cheap headphones so far. I'd like improvement in sound quality now that I have some budget, while keeping it wireless.  &#x200B;  From your list it seems that the G935 should be my best option (the GSP670 is way out of budget, I only find them at 300/350 euros)."
1627,"I don't have a Bluetooth guide up yet. But overall not many options.  The backbeats pro 2 is ok, but not for fps.  I also didn't find the bt-w2 to be that good. I had connection issues with it."
1628,"Thanks for the reply, I'll keep the backbeats pro 2 in consideration!  What do you mean with connection issues with the bt-w2? Pairing issues or constant issues when turning on the headphones? Do you recommend any other bluetooth transmitter that supports aptx-LL?"
1629,"I'm looking for a wireless gaming headset that allows simultaneous bluetooth.  It seems that means only the GSP670, the JBL Quantum 800, and the Arctis Pro Wireless.  I'd like at least decent mic quality and sound quality.  What would you recommend?"
1630,The gsp670 does offer simultaneous Bluetooth.  The quantum 800 and arctis pro wireless don't sound very good and I can't recommend them.  But in general if your going wireless your not getting a good mic or good sound.
1631,"I updated it just after I commented it.  Sadly with wireless there is no best of the worst. It's just some to 1 thing well and everything else bad.  Gsp670, no simultaneously Bluetooth but good sound and build. Not great connection, not great comfort, bad mic. Overpriced.   Arctis pro wireless, good features, good connection, not very good audio, bad mic, poor build, bad comfort unless you have small ears and a small head, poor durability. Very overpriced.  That's kinda the story for them all."
1632,"Maybe it’s been tested and it’s crap, but have you tested the Creative SXFI Theater?"
1633,"Understood :)  So let’s say, I wanted to get the Bowers & Wilkins PX 7 with a aptX LL Bluetooth adapter + Modmic Wireless, it would beat all of these headsets?"
1634,I wouldn't ever recommend buying the px7  It also doesn't support aptx LL. So buying a Bluetooth headphone then using it wired into a aptx LL adapter makes no sense as that would be the ultimate way to spend a ton of many for terrible sound.
1635,"I was using the PX7 as an example (based on the reviews it doesn't seem too bad) let me re-phrase this up then, let's say that I would get a pair of Bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL, would that then beat all of these headsets?"
1636,Depends which one. The px7 I wouldn't take even over some of these as bad as they are.   There isn't many aptx LL headphones. But if you could get a good one then of course.
1637,Anyone know if getting Astro A50’s is a good or bad idea are there better alternatives for Xbox?
1638,How about the Rig 800LX?
1639,Was doubting your reviews due to the disheartning nature of it until i saw the iems guide and having the jabras and sonys and completely agreeing...well crap.  Thank you for this candid list.   Internet is garbage in this house despite ethernet and nbn.  Microwave disrupts the signal enough to cause lag.  Did you still have connection problems with the g1wl or were they resolved?  Am i just better off saving my dosh and going with the better bang for buck hs70? Side note is the g1wl sound really that bad? The hyperx revolver s was the best headset ive had so i havent had an audiophile experience before to set a high bar.  If its that underwhelming i might replace them with g935s on the shortlist as they are the same price here. Edit: was the hs70 the pro or non pro edition?
1640,"The g1wl sound quality is average at best the issue is the tuning, it's super bassy and either slightly bright or ear bleeding bright. It was rough.  The hs70 sound wise isn't half bad the issue with it is the connection and qc issues."
1641,The g1 and gsp670 has the same issues.
1642,I recently invested in the Steel series Arctis 7 wirelwess headset and steered towards them mainly for console gaming and requiring wireless (over plugging to controller) and the skibands comfort and long battery life. I chose these as an affordable cousin of the big daddy pros but I'm wondering if their latency and sound quality differences etc would've warranted splashing out for the more expensive Steel.Pros??
1643,"I knew it was a big sacrifice for the wireless option but as far as wireless standards, I thought the 2.4ghz were the only decent option around..... at the risk of sounding ignorant thought, is the wired option i.e USBC to 3.5mm included a viable option or is the quality dependant on the headset and not connection?    https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/jw-computers-steelseries-arctis-7-2019-edition-white-288085/"
1644,Bluetooth has too much latency for gaming.  Only aptx LL and aptx adaptive have low enough latency for gaming or movies.
1645,"Ok thanks, I've just been reading that Bluetooth still has compression with aptX HD or aptX LL, with lower delays for LL but it still doesn't come near in terms of audio quality compared to a 2.4 ghz USB dongle connection? I'm just curious then why you would recommend a Bluetooth over it."
1646,Bluetooth tends to sound better because companies that make good audio use Bluetooth.  2.4ghz isn't great and all the rf options super suck.
1647," > aptX LL  Is this a hardware or software change? If I am interested in the Audeze Mobius, are they able to get updates to this standard later, or it is something built in and as this new technology comes around, you have to upgrade to do it?"
1648,Hs70 sounds better. Flight has less issues.
1649,"I've got an old wired Logitech H390 that I've used for years, but is starting to go out in 1 ear. Last November I got a cat, and it would just be so much easier to interact with the cat if my headphones are wireless. I'm not really a music listener and just need something for generic MMO/MOBA game audio and Push to Talk Discord chat. I was fine with the Logitech H800's sound/mic, but the foam pads gave me a scab on my ear... Seems like ""decent overall"" would fit what I'm looking for, so initially leaning to the MH670. By high clamp do you mean it strongly squeezes the sides of your head? Would you also say mic monitoring is important for someone who has only used on ear not over ear headsets? In that case maybe the Cloud Flight might be better? I really wish there was just a wireless version of the H390. Maybe I need to be looking more at office headsets, but they all seem to be Bluetooth or $300+"
1650,"Why do you recommend the Cloud Flight S is you haven't tested it yet? I'm looking to buy it, but the white noise issue is holding me back."
1651,I got the cloud flight and it's honestly pretty solid. Battery life is pretty good and the mic is surprisingly good. Some people in game have actually asked me if I'm a streamer because of the mic quality but take that with a grain of salt. Like 5/10 comfort. Haven't had any latency issues tbh
1652,"Hello Caboose, I do have MH670 and can't quite find good EQ for it tbh. What's your EQ settings?"
1653,How are you liking your 670s so far? Any crosstalk or hissing?
1654,I'm on the fence about buying these. Liking the lack of LEDs and the battery life. How bad is the sound? I'm on Corsair H1500's just now (complete with horrible background whine and excessive volume bugs).
1655,"I do have Cloud Core, MH751, Game One and MH670. 670 is the worst among these imo. I had Cloud Flight for a while it was better sounding, but comfort was worse."
1656,Sadly I need a wireless set. If I had the budget for the GSP's I'd grab them. I'd love to actually hear a set of the 670's before buying.   Going from these reviews I preferred the [mic quality of the MH670's](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/cooler-master-mh670/7.html) comapred to the [Cloud Flight](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/hyperx-cloud-flight/6.html)
1657,"I'm EQ'ing them from Microsoft Sound Control Panel. I also have MH751, I tried to make 670 sound like 751 but couldn't do it. They're definitely step down from 751."
1658,Been using the Corsair HS70...yeah the earpads cushion is failing on me slowly peeling off and I see that it can't be replaced. What about SteelSeries Arctis 1 and Asus ROG Strix GO 2.4?
1659,The average wireless gaming headset battery life is like 10-20.  The only thing that comes close to Bluetooth battery life is the gsp370. Which is closer to 100hours   Wireless gaming headsets are Rf not Bluetooth.  Wireless headphones are Bluetooth. Often called headsets but that's just because they have a built in call grade mic. Not good for gaming. Bad mic quality and too high of latency.
1660,Thats unfortunate. I couldn't find many headsets beyond 20 hours though sony do have a 35 hour headset. On sale for £40 which I had gotten that now instead of my 20 hour headset for £35 lol.
1661,Not applicable. Only used on the Virtuoso because it's sucks in almost everyway. But has the best mic on a wireless gaming headset. But it sounds bad and isn't built to well and isn't very comfortable.
1662,The virtuoso is the leat comfortable headset I've ever worn
1663,"Loving your honest reviews of these products, thanks for your efforts man. Keep seeing the Virtuoso being recommended everywhere but my experience with their H2100 & H1500 has sworn me off them for life. Glad to hear they're shite."

Is there an EQ option that magically appears when you plug in the Flight S instead of the regular Flights? I'm also wary of the complaints about really bad 7.1 sound and white noise, which wasn't present at all on the Cloud Flight."
1671,"I know they're old, but what do you think of the Razer Man O War? I have a set that I'm looking to change out for something else but I really appreciate the wireless factor as I have pet parrots that love chewing on wires. I keep reading that the sound and mic quality are huge problems with so many of these wireless headsets, but I've never had any issues with my headset as far as sound and mic quality. Am I judging from a lack of experience or did they just manage to get it right the one time? If it is just lack of experience, how much better/worse is the one I have than the options you listed here? I've been giving serious thought to the virtuoso but this gives me pause."
1672,The man o war is awful. I'm also removing the Virtuoso from the list as it very bad but the mic rocks. And it's not worth itm  Wait for the Audeze Penrose.
1673,"I can't believe that, after such a long search and finally arriving at this thread, I end up with the knowledge that I've unconsciously chosen the best option... two years ago.  Seriously? For two years nothing better than Cloud Flight appeared on the market?  They're okay for me, good for gaming and voip, but they're missing one thing that'd make them golden: ANC. I tried to use them in open space at the office, and the lack of noise isolation/ANC clearly shows. I can't get back to a wired headset, so I guess I'll just stop searching and accept that there's no wireless headset with ANC and decent mic, which does NOT rely on ancient Bluetooth HSP/HFP."
1674,"Anc isn't good for gaming sadly it's why most companies don't mess with it. It negativity affects not only audio quality but also gaming preformance.  RF wireless is honestly dying.  Bluetooth is so much more advanced and better, it will be the future of wireless. For headsets it is limited for bandwidth for a good mic."
1675,Bluetooth focuses on audio quality first. Mic quality second.  2.4GHz wireless has similar issues and limitations which it's why audio quality is never great and mic quality always sucks.  Bluetooth Atleast leans to what's important. Gaming company's kinda half ass both.
1676,"What about bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL?  Is there anything good out there in the price range you explored within your guide?  I was considering to get a creative BT-W2 to plug in my pc plus a pair of headphones that could benefit from that (I already have a stand alone mic for discord chats).    Still not sure what to pick, I always used cheap headphones so far. I'd like improvement in sound quality now that I have some budget, while keeping it wireless.  &#x200B;  From your list it seems that the G935 should be my best option (the GSP670 is way out of budget, I only find them at 300/350 euros)."
1677,"I don't have a Bluetooth guide up yet. But overall not many options.  The backbeats pro 2 is ok, but not for fps.  I also didn't find the bt-w2 to be that good. I had connection issues with it."
1678,"Thanks for the reply, I'll keep the backbeats pro 2 in consideration!  What do you mean with connection issues with the bt-w2? Pairing issues or constant issues when turning on the headphones? Do you recommend any other bluetooth transmitter that supports aptx-LL?"
1679,"I'm looking for a wireless gaming headset that allows simultaneous bluetooth.  It seems that means only the GSP670, the JBL Quantum 800, and the Arctis Pro Wireless.  I'd like at least decent mic quality and sound quality.  What would you recommend?"
1680,The gsp670 does offer simultaneous Bluetooth.  The quantum 800 and arctis pro wireless don't sound very good and I can't recommend them.  But in general if your going wireless your not getting a good mic or good sound.
1681,"I updated it just after I commented it.  Sadly with wireless there is no best of the worst. It's just some to 1 thing well and everything else bad.  Gsp670, no simultaneously Bluetooth but good sound and build. Not great connection, not great comfort, bad mic. Overpriced.   Arctis pro wireless, good features, good connection, not very good audio, bad mic, poor build, bad comfort unless you have small ears and a small head, poor durability. Very overpriced.  That's kinda the story for them all."
1682,"Maybe it’s been tested and it’s crap, but have you tested the Creative SXFI Theater?"
1683,"Understood :)  So let’s say, I wanted to get the Bowers & Wilkins PX 7 with a aptX LL Bluetooth adapter + Modmic Wireless, it would beat all of these headsets?"
1684,I wouldn't ever recommend buying the px7  It also doesn't support aptx LL. So buying a Bluetooth headphone then using it wired into a aptx LL adapter makes no sense as that would be the ultimate way to spend a ton of many for terrible sound.
1685,"I was using the PX7 as an example (based on the reviews it doesn't seem too bad) let me re-phrase this up then, let's say that I would get a pair of Bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL, would that then beat all of these headsets?"
1686,Depends which one. The px7 I wouldn't take even over some of these as bad as they are.   There isn't many aptx LL headphones. But if you could get a good one then of course.
1687,Anyone know if getting Astro A50’s is a good or bad idea are there better alternatives for Xbox?
1688,How about the Rig 800LX?
1689,Was doubting your reviews due to the disheartning nature of it until i saw the iems guide and having the jabras and sonys and completely agreeing...well crap.  Thank you for this candid list.   Internet is garbage in this house despite ethernet and nbn.  Microwave disrupts the signal enough to cause lag.  Did you still have connection problems with the g1wl or were they resolved?  Am i just better off saving my dosh and going with the better bang for buck hs70? Side note is the g1wl sound really that bad? The hyperx revolver s was the best headset ive had so i havent had an audiophile experience before to set a high bar.  If its that underwhelming i might replace them with g935s on the shortlist as they are the same price here. Edit: was the hs70 the pro or non pro edition?
1690,"The g1wl sound quality is average at best the issue is the tuning, it's super bassy and either slightly bright or ear bleeding bright. It was rough.  The hs70 sound wise isn't half bad the issue with it is the connection and qc issues."
1691,The g1 and gsp670 has the same issues.
1692,I recently invested in the Steel series Arctis 7 wirelwess headset and steered towards them mainly for console gaming and requiring wireless (over plugging to controller) and the skibands comfort and long battery life. I chose these as an affordable cousin of the big daddy pros but I'm wondering if their latency and sound quality differences etc would've warranted splashing out for the more expensive Steel.Pros??
1693,"I knew it was a big sacrifice for the wireless option but as far as wireless standards, I thought the 2.4ghz were the only decent option around..... at the risk of sounding ignorant thought, is the wired option i.e USBC to 3.5mm included a viable option or is the quality dependant on the headset and not connection?    https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/jw-computers-steelseries-arctis-7-2019-edition-white-288085/"
1694,Bluetooth has too much latency for gaming.  Only aptx LL and aptx adaptive have low enough latency for gaming or movies.
1695,"Ok thanks, I've just been reading that Bluetooth still has compression with aptX HD or aptX LL, with lower delays for LL but it still doesn't come near in terms of audio quality compared to a 2.4 ghz USB dongle connection? I'm just curious then why you would recommend a Bluetooth over it."
1696,Bluetooth tends to sound better because companies that make good audio use Bluetooth.  2.4ghz isn't great and all the rf options super suck.
1697," > aptX LL  Is this a hardware or software change? If I am interested in the Audeze Mobius, are they able to get updates to this standard later, or it is something built in and as this new technology comes around, you have to upgrade to do it?"
1698,Hs70 sounds better. Flight has less issues.
1699,"I've got an old wired Logitech H390 that I've used for years, but is starting to go out in 1 ear. Last November I got a cat, and it would just be so much easier to interact with the cat if my headphones are wireless. I'm not really a music listener and just need something for generic MMO/MOBA game audio and Push to Talk Discord chat. I was fine with the Logitech H800's sound/mic, but the foam pads gave me a scab on my ear... Seems like ""decent overall"" would fit what I'm looking for, so initially leaning to the MH670. By high clamp do you mean it strongly squeezes the sides of your head? Would you also say mic monitoring is important for someone who has only used on ear not over ear headsets? In that case maybe the Cloud Flight might be better? I really wish there was just a wireless version of the H390. Maybe I need to be looking more at office headsets, but they all seem to be Bluetooth or $300+"
1700,"Why do you recommend the Cloud Flight S is you haven't tested it yet? I'm looking to buy it, but the white noise issue is holding me back."
1701,I got the cloud flight and it's honestly pretty solid. Battery life is pretty good and the mic is surprisingly good. Some people in game have actually asked me if I'm a streamer because of the mic quality but take that with a grain of salt. Like 5/10 comfort. Haven't had any latency issues tbh
1702,"Hello Caboose, I do have MH670 and can't quite find good EQ for it tbh. What's your EQ settings?"
1703,How are you liking your 670s so far? Any crosstalk or hissing?
1704,I'm on the fence about buying these. Liking the lack of LEDs and the battery life. How bad is the sound? I'm on Corsair H1500's just now (complete with horrible background whine and excessive volume bugs).
1705,"I do have Cloud Core, MH751, Game One and MH670. 670 is the worst among these imo. I had Cloud Flight for a while it was better sounding, but comfort was worse."
1706,Sadly I need a wireless set. If I had the budget for the GSP's I'd grab them. I'd love to actually hear a set of the 670's before buying.   Going from these reviews I preferred the [mic quality of the MH670's](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/cooler-master-mh670/7.html) comapred to the [Cloud Flight](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/hyperx-cloud-flight/6.html)
1707,"I'm EQ'ing them from Microsoft Sound Control Panel. I also have MH751, I tried to make 670 sound like 751 but couldn't do it. They're definitely step down from 751."
1708,Been using the Corsair HS70...yeah the earpads cushion is failing on me slowly peeling off and I see that it can't be replaced. What about SteelSeries Arctis 1 and Asus ROG Strix GO 2.4?
1709,The average wireless gaming headset battery life is like 10-20.  The only thing that comes close to Bluetooth battery life is the gsp370. Which is closer to 100hours   Wireless gaming headsets are Rf not Bluetooth.  Wireless headphones are Bluetooth. Often called headsets but that's just because they have a built in call grade mic. Not good for gaming. Bad mic quality and too high of latency.
1710,Thats unfortunate. I couldn't find many headsets beyond 20 hours though sony do have a 35 hour headset. On sale for £40 which I had gotten that now instead of my 20 hour headset for £35 lol.
1711,Not applicable. Only used on the Virtuoso because it's sucks in almost everyway. But has the best mic on a wireless gaming headset. But it sounds bad and isn't built to well and isn't very comfortable.
1712,The virtuoso is the leat comfortable headset I've ever worn
1713,"Loving your honest reviews of these products, thanks for your efforts man. Keep seeing the Virtuoso being recommended everywhere but my experience with their H2100 & H1500 has sworn me off them for life. Glad to hear they're shite."
1714,Get the hd560s. Or pc38x for pure gaming performance. DT990 can hurt for a lot of people due to the piercing treble. Both of the options mentioned can be ran off mobo audio or through the apple dongle.
1715,"Another vote for pc38x, I've had them since they came out. I think they're super comfortable, personally I like open ear headphones for gaming because I still like to hear what's going on around me while I play games."
1716,"This. And for OP, if you want to have an amp to get the most out of future headphones (of which may or may not need more power), you can consider a few budget options: Schiit Hel, Schiit Fulla 4, iFi Zen DAC (or V2), FiiO K5 Pro, etc. All listed are DAC/AMP singular units, which act as a DAC and AMP all together. Not the best of both worlds but it's a great start and opens up many more headphone options. For gaming, get the Schiit Hel or Schiit Fulla 4 because they have a mic jack.  Disclaimer. I only own the iFi Zen DAC original, and I love it. Gives me plenty of volume with my HiFiMan HE400se (which I find meh for competitive gaming versus my Philips SHP9600)."
1717,"I also suggest the Sennheiser 560s. I use it myself and I play Apex and COD, very good imaging and sound quality."
1718,"I personally use a dac/amp, the JDS labs Element II, But you can easily run it off just the PC cuz my iPhone can run it fine"
1719,If u want gaming go full on Sennheiser. Honestly most of their gaming headphones sound pretty much the same. I am not aware of their top headphones for gaming but few years back Game zero was above average and still is a good choice.
1720,"Ohms are a unit of electrical resistance; the higher the resistance, the more voltage is required to push a given amount of current through a headphone. What (if any) headphone amp do you have? If you don't have one don't get the 250 ohms."
1721,"I’m confused. Not by high impedance and low Impedance…. But that you just disagreed with this original comment, then restated what he said but slightly different.   He said if you don’t have an amp to power the high impedance don’t get the high impedance headphones.   Only difference is you mentioned a DAC, which offers no power difference. A DACs job is literally what DAC stands for: digital audio converter. It converts digital audio to analog audio. An amplifier on the other hand amplifies your source to properly power headphones which is when impedance matters.   If I plug my 300ohm HD800S’s into my DAC alone they will be insanely quiet because they aren’t getting any power increase from my amplifier…. Now if I plug my DAC into my pc to convert the digital to analog, then plug my amp into my DAC, and my headphones into my amp, my headphones now can get so loud that some find the sound level too much.   Idk if I’m explaining this incorrectly or if you don’t know the difference between an amp and a DAC but either way the original comment is correct in my opinion… if you don’t have or don’t plan on buying an amp, then don’t get high impedance phones.  BTW: my friend has dt990P and a 50 dollar tube amp from Amazon powers his headphones surprising well and sounds great for the tiny cost."
1722,"Hard to say. Everyone is different.  I currently own Sennheiser HD58X, Philips Fidelio X2HR, Philips SHP9500 and AKG K702.  I found the 58X and X2HR not very good for FPS gaming where as they are recommended often (And why I bought them in the first place). The SHP9500 are better for gaming for me although no patch on the K702 imo."
1723,AKG K702 or 712 are awesome for gaming and object placement. The sound stage is huge
1724,The K612 Pros are also fantastic and arguably better for music than the 702/712s.  And cheaper in many places!
1725,"Yeah but you might as well as go with sennheisers when you go down a tier.  The k702s are great for music, and are amazing for gaming.  They are $254 dollars on Newegg.  I wouldn’t sacrifice detail for money. With headphones you need to make leaps not steps up.  With the k702 I can accurately place the virtual speaker arcs on Dolby headphone, using my asus xonar.  You won’t find better at this price."
1726,"Sure.  I'm planning to upgrade to either Sundaras or Arias at some point in the future.  The positional accuracy of the K612's are not to be underestimated, though, they are absolutely fantastic -- extremely flat with a huge soundstage.  I prefer them for gaming to the 400i's I use primarily for music."
1727,"I have the hifiman he500.  When I bought them, they were $799.99 and at the time, I was using the ultrasone pro 900 for gaming at night when my wife was sleeping and the k702 when open headphones could be used.  There is more detail in the hifimans but I can’t really say that they have the positional accuracy for some reason. I’m thinking it’s probably because of the bass in the he500 was definitely more prominent than the upper mids that are prominent in the k702. This is where most of the positional cues are."
1728,If you're considering the 990s might as well include the TYGR300 or MMX300 Gen 2 on that list. Never heard these two yet but those who heard them said that both images better than 990s. Plus also not having as much of that ear raping treble.
1729,He400se is really good for gaming especially fps
1730,"Depending on the type of gaming you are doing there are a few options. Most have been covered  in this post (tygr 300, akg 712), however, I don’t see much here about the Sennheiser 599s.   Personally I find the 599s to be excellent for shooters — their soundstage is incredibly large and full. It produces crisp footsteps that are not drowned out in the bass of gunfire and firefights will not stop you from pinpointing a single footstep given off by a lurker.   For immersive Rpg/Arpg/Mmos I would recommend trying to hunt down the tygr 300r, as it will have a stronger ingame feel to it for these genres, however, the 599s will service you well in these types.   I do not recommend the 599s for pop music, but they are excellent for classical, metal, rap, and rock.  As far as price tag goes, the 599 black model was 102 shipped and taxed on prime day a few weeks ago so you may find some great second hand deals on unopened ones. Otherwise, it still punches above its weight for its price class at its retail — personally I have the SE which are beige, but for my friends I got them the black models when they were on sale.   Hopefully this helps in your journey! If you have more questions feel free to ask.  Edit: I forgot to add, the 599s will not need a DAC/Amp which is part of why I chose them, although they can certainly be juiced."
1731,"I currently have DT990 pro 250ohms with fiio k5 pro and want to upgrade my headphones because I have a problem when gunfire appears - i cant pinpoint any footsteps. Do you think 599 will be better than dt990 pro? Also consideting hd58x, hd6xx, hifimans"
1732,"I have no issues on Valorant with pinpointing footsteps during things like Odinspam or intense firefights. It should be more than servicable. I have not tried those alternatives, as I found the 599Se were perfect for my usage (casting and fps)."
1733,"Hi.. I'm planning to get the 599 SE as well but I have been hearing mixed reviews saying they are muddy, veiled, takes time to get used to etc. What were first impressions when you got them? Are these your first open back headphones?"
1734,"These were my first opens, however, I got a few others to try them (akg712, dt 8xx, 6xx) and make my decision (these were the first of the batch that came in and I put them on first as well, certainly adds bias).   I have not found them to be muddy or veiled, nor do they have a burn in period (imo). I have one pair myself but I purchased two more during prime day for my best friend and father and tried theirs as well. They sounded virtually identical (I may not be able to hear the difference if there is one) when I tried them (I was wondering about that mythical ‘burn in’ myself).   Compared to my previous ‘gaming’ headsets they are like crystal perfection as well. I previously utilized Cloud 9 hyperx Alphas (different models, revolver, rev s, etc) and a few other astro/steel series models.   I will say the easiest explanation for clarity is this: I listen to a lot of classical and in, for example, tchaikovsky I can pick out the individual elements of the orchestra and where they are on the stage itself. Additionally, in shooters, I can pick out exactly where footsteps come from on a site.   I think the bass may be jarring for some people — it is not as guttural/boomy as a ‘gamer’ headset, instead being more throaty and pealing out in individual notes. But if you are looking for a thump thump/wub wub you are probably going to want a different headset, as this is much more equipped for tonality, trebles, mids, and soundstage."
1735,"I have the DT990s and I absolutely love them for gaming and music. Super comfortable, clear audio, and great soundstage. Get a nice amp and never look back."
1736,k371 m8 strong treble and gr8 imaging
1737,you should get the Phillips Fidelio X2HR you would love them and they are very affordable.
1738,"+1 for the Fidelios.  I ordered and returned a few headphones including the dt990 and the dt770 and ended up keeping the Fidelios, the clarity is amazing and they don't need an amplifier."
1739,tbh i find the DT 770 a little bit superior if you tend to listen to more music.
1740,"The difference is only if you work in a studio and need certain impedance for certain source devices. That's the only reason they make it in various impedance versions. 99,99% people could never tell any difference between these and if they say they do, they lie. So for your convenience get lower impedance version which needs less input power to get them working good. Regarding gaming, I have always been playing using closed headphones, mainly Counter-Strike where positioning of footsteps etc. is very important. I have mostly used Audio Technica SJ5 and currently Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro (250Ohm). People have been surprised on several occasions how much and early I was able to hear and I also feel pretty confident about it so I say closed design is nothing but good for the purpose."
1741,"Other comments here are great, second them.  Imma say 559s suck, 599s and 560s are way better."
1742,"I'd say go for the HarmonicDyne Zeus. Big soundstage and good imaging, great for gaming and music and movie watching, it's a good option. It costs $350, however."
1743,try danon d7200
1744,"Yea, I think I have the same recs, if you budget is under 200$, get the pc38x, if you can pay up a little more, 560s + dac/amp in one (k5 pro), then you will be in very good hands."
1745,"shp9500, affordable and excellent soundstage for everything gaming, don't need anything else"
1746,"I have HD559 and strongly recommend against them, as they are nothing like my previous HD555. The HD559 have lower sound quality, are muddy and far in a blanketed way. Since HD579 aren't sold anymore I would start with HD599 and up.  And no, that is not a Sennheiser sound if someone will try to tell you that. The HD555 were crisp and spacious with mid-low boost that made bass soft, bow strings flowing and added a bit of punch to electric guitars. The HD595 which are now known as HD599 are very similar, but sound even a bit more spacious."
1747,"My personal roster for headphones are hd8xx(launching around nov similar to hd800s), k712 pro, k7XX, pc38x and tygr300r. My personal favorite os the pc38x because it just does everything and does it lovely,  is so airy and punchy, yet enough detail and warm to heard it all day but its kindy stiff at the start so I changed pads to brainwavz fenestraied, tygrs are bit less in mid range, k712 is not that punchy and requires good amp (but one of the best all rounder and detailed) and any hd800 is way to expensive for just gaming but still the best death precision imaging i have tried. Pc38x just earned my respects for its price and easy of use. With pc38x/pc37x being so good for gaming I see no reason to look at the 500 series."
1748,"I tested quite a few headphones in terms of Apex Legends (over the last 2 years and testing some that are not my own, didnt buy them all :D)  - Sennheiser HD 599 - Sennheiser HD 560s - Focal Clear MG Pro - Focal Elegia (also with dekoni pads) - Beyerdynamic DT 770 250 ohm - Beyerdynamic DT 990 250 ohm - Hyperx Cloud II - Superluxx HD681 - Koss Porta Pro  my very subjective top ranks, while I can't realistically sort them all, would be: 1. Focal Elegia 2. Sennheiser HD 560s 3. Focal Clear MG Pro"
1749,The pc38x and Tygr 300r are amazing for comp FPS gaming. The former coming with a mic. Both can be run with or without an amp.
1750,Get the hd560s. Or pc38x for pure gaming performance. DT990 can hurt for a lot of people due to the piercing treble. Both of the options mentioned can be ran off mobo audio or through the apple dongle.

The positional accuracy of the K612's are not to be underestimated, though, they are absolutely fantastic -- extremely flat with a huge soundstage.  I prefer them for gaming to the 400i's I use primarily for music."
1763,"I have the hifiman he500.  When I bought them, they were $799.99 and at the time, I was using the ultrasone pro 900 for gaming at night when my wife was sleeping and the k702 when open headphones could be used.  There is more detail in the hifimans but I can’t really say that they have the positional accuracy for some reason. I’m thinking it’s probably because of the bass in the he500 was definitely more prominent than the upper mids that are prominent in the k702. This is where most of the positional cues are."
1764,If you're considering the 990s might as well include the TYGR300 or MMX300 Gen 2 on that list. Never heard these two yet but those who heard them said that both images better than 990s. Plus also not having as much of that ear raping treble.
1765,He400se is really good for gaming especially fps
1766,"Depending on the type of gaming you are doing there are a few options. Most have been covered  in this post (tygr 300, akg 712), however, I don’t see much here about the Sennheiser 599s.   Personally I find the 599s to be excellent for shooters — their soundstage is incredibly large and full. It produces crisp footsteps that are not drowned out in the bass of gunfire and firefights will not stop you from pinpointing a single footstep given off by a lurker.   For immersive Rpg/Arpg/Mmos I would recommend trying to hunt down the tygr 300r, as it will have a stronger ingame feel to it for these genres, however, the 599s will service you well in these types.   I do not recommend the 599s for pop music, but they are excellent for classical, metal, rap, and rock.  As far as price tag goes, the 599 black model was 102 shipped and taxed on prime day a few weeks ago so you may find some great second hand deals on unopened ones. Otherwise, it still punches above its weight for its price class at its retail — personally I have the SE which are beige, but for my friends I got them the black models when they were on sale.   Hopefully this helps in your journey! If you have more questions feel free to ask.  Edit: I forgot to add, the 599s will not need a DAC/Amp which is part of why I chose them, although they can certainly be juiced."
1767,"I currently have DT990 pro 250ohms with fiio k5 pro and want to upgrade my headphones because I have a problem when gunfire appears - i cant pinpoint any footsteps. Do you think 599 will be better than dt990 pro? Also consideting hd58x, hd6xx, hifimans"
1768,"I have no issues on Valorant with pinpointing footsteps during things like Odinspam or intense firefights. It should be more than servicable. I have not tried those alternatives, as I found the 599Se were perfect for my usage (casting and fps)."
1769,"Hi.. I'm planning to get the 599 SE as well but I have been hearing mixed reviews saying they are muddy, veiled, takes time to get used to etc. What were first impressions when you got them? Are these your first open back headphones?"
1770,"These were my first opens, however, I got a few others to try them (akg712, dt 8xx, 6xx) and make my decision (these were the first of the batch that came in and I put them on first as well, certainly adds bias).   I have not found them to be muddy or veiled, nor do they have a burn in period (imo). I have one pair myself but I purchased two more during prime day for my best friend and father and tried theirs as well. They sounded virtually identical (I may not be able to hear the difference if there is one) when I tried them (I was wondering about that mythical ‘burn in’ myself).   Compared to my previous ‘gaming’ headsets they are like crystal perfection as well. I previously utilized Cloud 9 hyperx Alphas (different models, revolver, rev s, etc) and a few other astro/steel series models.   I will say the easiest explanation for clarity is this: I listen to a lot of classical and in, for example, tchaikovsky I can pick out the individual elements of the orchestra and where they are on the stage itself. Additionally, in shooters, I can pick out exactly where footsteps come from on a site.   I think the bass may be jarring for some people — it is not as guttural/boomy as a ‘gamer’ headset, instead being more throaty and pealing out in individual notes. But if you are looking for a thump thump/wub wub you are probably going to want a different headset, as this is much more equipped for tonality, trebles, mids, and soundstage."
1771,"I have the DT990s and I absolutely love them for gaming and music. Super comfortable, clear audio, and great soundstage. Get a nice amp and never look back."
1772,k371 m8 strong treble and gr8 imaging
1773,you should get the Phillips Fidelio X2HR you would love them and they are very affordable.
1774,"+1 for the Fidelios.  I ordered and returned a few headphones including the dt990 and the dt770 and ended up keeping the Fidelios, the clarity is amazing and they don't need an amplifier."
1775,tbh i find the DT 770 a little bit superior if you tend to listen to more music.
1776,"The difference is only if you work in a studio and need certain impedance for certain source devices. That's the only reason they make it in various impedance versions. 99,99% people could never tell any difference between these and if they say they do, they lie. So for your convenience get lower impedance version which needs less input power to get them working good. Regarding gaming, I have always been playing using closed headphones, mainly Counter-Strike where positioning of footsteps etc. is very important. I have mostly used Audio Technica SJ5 and currently Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro (250Ohm). People have been surprised on several occasions how much and early I was able to hear and I also feel pretty confident about it so I say closed design is nothing but good for the purpose."
1777,"Other comments here are great, second them.  Imma say 559s suck, 599s and 560s are way better."
1778,"I'd say go for the HarmonicDyne Zeus. Big soundstage and good imaging, great for gaming and music and movie watching, it's a good option. It costs $350, however."
1779,try danon d7200
1780,"Yea, I think I have the same recs, if you budget is under 200$, get the pc38x, if you can pay up a little more, 560s + dac/amp in one (k5 pro), then you will be in very good hands."
1781,"shp9500, affordable and excellent soundstage for everything gaming, don't need anything else"
1782,"I have HD559 and strongly recommend against them, as they are nothing like my previous HD555. The HD559 have lower sound quality, are muddy and far in a blanketed way. Since HD579 aren't sold anymore I would start with HD599 and up.  And no, that is not a Sennheiser sound if someone will try to tell you that. The HD555 were crisp and spacious with mid-low boost that made bass soft, bow strings flowing and added a bit of punch to electric guitars. The HD595 which are now known as HD599 are very similar, but sound even a bit more spacious."
1783,"My personal roster for headphones are hd8xx(launching around nov similar to hd800s), k712 pro, k7XX, pc38x and tygr300r. My personal favorite os the pc38x because it just does everything and does it lovely,  is so airy and punchy, yet enough detail and warm to heard it all day but its kindy stiff at the start so I changed pads to brainwavz fenestraied, tygrs are bit less in mid range, k712 is not that punchy and requires good amp (but one of the best all rounder and detailed) and any hd800 is way to expensive for just gaming but still the best death precision imaging i have tried. Pc38x just earned my respects for its price and easy of use. With pc38x/pc37x being so good for gaming I see no reason to look at the 500 series."
1784,"I tested quite a few headphones in terms of Apex Legends (over the last 2 years and testing some that are not my own, didnt buy them all :D)  - Sennheiser HD 599 - Sennheiser HD 560s - Focal Clear MG Pro - Focal Elegia (also with dekoni pads) - Beyerdynamic DT 770 250 ohm - Beyerdynamic DT 990 250 ohm - Hyperx Cloud II - Superluxx HD681 - Koss Porta Pro  my very subjective top ranks, while I can't realistically sort them all, would be: 1. Focal Elegia 2. Sennheiser HD 560s 3. Focal Clear MG Pro"
1785,The pc38x and Tygr 300r are amazing for comp FPS gaming. The former coming with a mic. Both can be run with or without an amp.
1786,"It's the same with microphones. People don't consume the content of their own webcam, thus they don't care. It has to be so bad that others complain about it before they would start looking for improvements.  At least that's my take on the situation  That being said, it surprises me that notebook manufacturers don't use them as a way to differentiate their product."
1787,"I mean, they don't though. https://www.amazon.com/Desktop-with110-Degree-Digital-Microphone-Recording/dp/B082CJPNB5  I've used this, for a client, and it looks fine. They suck because people dont know what 1080p means, or why they want it, and buy 720p or lower. I sell these kinds of things all the time, usually people just check out a Logitech and see the good ones for $100 and think that's what they need to spend for something good, but cheap out and buy some unmarked thing. There's a middle ground, and they're perfect for video conferencing."
1788,Zoom compresses the shit out of your webcam feed anyway.
1789,"Zoom is ok, you seen Google Meet? Makes zoom look good in comparison."
1790,Right!?  I just got a new ultra book for work and it has a clearer wider shot.  I hate it!
1791,In the university I work at we use Zoom and people really don't care as as long as they can be seen and heard.  Same goes for good quality microphones.
1792,">Why does every single one of those sound like it was recorded off of a landline from 1960? Its always this horrific quality that you can barely understand. No phone sounds like that anymore  So that's the gotcha. Landlines are still using the legacy frequency ranges we have used for a century. Additional digital compression may be added by the phone company and phone system the radio station is using as well. They may also filter some frequncies as well if they can be problematic like hiss or background hum.  HD voice sounds great on modern phones. But if you are not calling an HD voice enabled line, which is pretty much every landline, you are falling back to older cellular voice codecs, which are far heavier compressed then landlines. This could be as new as ones introduced with 3G in the 2000s, but Verizon for example, still falls back to the CDMA codecs they used in the mid-90s and was designed for 2G, and as a result, sound absolutely horrid.  So you are hearing the result of legacy cell phone compression, on top of landline compression, on top of radio station phone system compression. That may be genuinely what the phone call sounds line once it reaches their equipment."
1793,"Apple actually has this thing called a “face time” and I know it’s hard to see, but if you look closely at your iPhone you’ll actually see a 12mp  webcam!  Seriously though, decent camera sensors alone aren’t cheap. Sony probably has a major market share and Logitech probably just buys the low end sensors from suppliers like them. People often think Logitech is a great company and sometimes they make nice toys but they’re ultimately low quality, nice looking, and convenient. They’re like the Bose of computer peripherals."
1794,They make the best mouse features but they are not the best in pointing devices. Would have agreed with you a few years ago but the switch quality and power they run them at causes huge problems. If you really want to get into it start googling. Having click issues within a year of purchase is entirely avoidable but they won't do anything about it. Unfortunately Logitech is an empty shell of what they used to be
1795," >They’re like the Bose of computer peripherals.  Are they even as ""good"" as Bose?  I think of them more like, idk, skull candy where they're serviceable mass-market products that and cheap and also good enough for the average person."
1796,That's exactly what Bose is. Bose became popular because they're cheap enough and good enough for most people but not once have they ever been considered a worthwhile brand by anyone that enjoys audio as a hobby.
1797,"It depends on what you're looking for. I think it's unfair to compare them to Bose. Especially their mouse lineup is very serviceable for both gaming and productivity. Plus, their customer service is exceptional in the states at least. I used to have a mouse from a very ""gamer"" brand, but after the shitty product support and customer service, it'll take a lot for me to consider anything not Logi for mice."
1798,So what's a better noise cancelling headphones than the QuietComfort ? Because AFAIK those are what made Bose beyond famous.
1799,I believe that Sony has been beating Bose on noise-canceling with their WH line of headphones
1800,I will look into that!   My Bose QC cans in various generations have been saving my sanity since my globetrotting days started in 2009. At least three transoceanic trips a year. I do not know how people can stand eight plus hours of jet noise without a break.
1801,"The WH-1000XM4 was routinely listed as the best consumer-grade noise cancelling wireless headphones when I was shopping last year. I don't have a frame of reference with other headphones, but I'm pretty happy with my pair."
1802,I was looking at the XM3 earlier today for cost reasons and it seems the XM4 is not that much better. https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-vs-sony-wh-1000xm3-38479/
1803,Absolutely Sony blows Bose out of the water
1804,"Good point, I think I compared the two because they’re both often behind. Logi took a long time to release a mech keyboards that matched the features of their high end plastic frame and rubber dome keyboards; a lot of recent bose stuff doesn’t even natively support Bluetooth and their current lineup has incredibly minimal homekit features only recently got airplay and that’s probably only because their Bluetooth was so bad"
1805,"Okay, but using a G Master lens on a webcam setup is pretty ridiculous. You'd get identical quality out of a $500 used Tamron lens for the purposes of a webcam. Come on."
1806,"I know, I know. But the [ridiculousness is half the fun.](https://i.imgur.com/alPpAwX.png) : )  That, and people getting slightly annoyed how much better I look in meetings. lol  And *then* their faces when they ask what webcam I'm using and I show them that list. Pure bliss.  I just thoroughly enjoy doing the excessive opposite of what everybody else is doing.  Everybody is rocking shitty laptop webcams, barely above the GameBoy Camera? Of course I'm building an almost $4000 webcam you could shoot a movie on. Duh!  Everybody is wearing these tiny white apple earpods that look like you've got lollipop sticks stuck in your ear? You can bet your behind that I'm wearing [the most chunky, black, industrial looking headphones I can get my hands on](https://i.imgur.com/VdDaJF9.png) (Sennheiser RS 185, highly recommended wireless headphones!), just to see if someone reacts, and boy do they.  Anyway. That's my way of making these insufferable meetings a little bit more fun.  > You'd get identical quality out of a $500 used Tamron lens  Yeah, this is by no means a buying guide, this is just me being extravagant. ; )  If we're being reasonable, any shitty $300 point n shoot with HDMI-out would give you a complete package that could beat those laptop webcams without breaking a sweat. I just wanted to setup the most excessive webcam that I could with the parts that I already got.  I also tried a [Voigtländer Nokton 40mm 1.2](https://geizhals.eu/voigtlaender-nokton-40mm-1-2-for-sony-e-black-19665-a1705684.html), beautiful portrait lens with absurd DOF, but unfortunately my desk isn't deep enough for that focal length. I can barely get my face in frame but with a lens like that you really need some good amount of background to truly appreciate the bokeh rendering."
1807,"There hasn't been a good new RTS release since StarCraft 2 in 2010. And even that wasn't as good as the original as some of the Korean pros have gone back to StarCraft, the original."
1808,By new you mean new ip right? Because AOE has been good.
1809,"Yeah it's true but for cheaper just get a cheaper camera. I've seen old gopro, I think it was a hero 4, plugged in via some chince usb capture card (like it wasn't an expensive capture card, $20 max usb 2.0) and it worked fine, look much better than any 1080p logitec webcam"
1810,"I have a [Logitech Brio](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/brio-4k-hdr-webcam.960-001105.html) (which is around $200) and the quality is pretty good. Plus, Windows Hello is super convenient.  Also, Dell just released the [UltraSharp webcam](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-webcam/apd/319-bbhp/pc-accessories) (also at $200) which is pretty good according to reviews."
1811,"The Brio isn't any better image quality wise than the other Logitech cameras. People at the other end don't see the 4K but probably 720p or lower. There's more to image quality than resolution, past 720p its the least important problem for current webcams and the Brio shares all those same problems.   Webcams don't lock the shutter speed to keep the image smooth they just dump that in the mix with other settings to keep the image bright and it does make the result jerky...all webcams do this not just the Brio."
1812,"The Brio is a terrible webcam. It has severe tech issues that result in nonstop problems (frame dropping, visual glitching like it was a satellite feed, outright crashing) on certain hardware.  If it works on your machine it works well but if you run into any issues, good luck getting it to work at all."
1813,"Serious streamer here (full-time for years now) and I still use a C920. I recently tried out the new Elgato Facecam but it has horrible color reproduction and overdoes the smoothing so it looks like a mild snapchat filter.  I know several 'serious streamers', full-timers, who don't give a shit about a DSLR and use whatever $50-150 cam they have."
1814,"Most use mirrorless cameras now, but DSLRs work as well. Also most camera manufacturers support video over USB. Your PC sees the camera as a webcam."
1815,"Yes, I have used an app called droidcam to use my phone as a webcam. I used a selfie stick/phone tripod to mount it. Works pretty well!"
1816,No most twitch streamers just use the logitech c920...I promise you xQc does not use nor know how to use a DSLR camera set up.
1817,"Sadly, my dslr doesn’t have hdmi pass through!!!  (Fuji xt-10)… i have to use my rx-100 (sony) with a crop in past to remove the interface…."
1818,"I'm not sure about your DSLR, but I have an old Canon T2i that can send video over USB which is what I use for my webcam. It's old and tired as far as cameras go, but it is an amazing webcam. You might be able to get it working over usb"
1819,Use Droidcam with you smartphone and save money.
1820,Also a poor angle! I tried a flex mount but it was too flexible. I quit trying after that.
1821,"So much this, I use my old S7 Edge and it looks sooo good. If someone has an old phone laying around, give it a shot."
1822,Or camo for anyone with iOS   (Ik OP said he had a android phone)
1823,"Yeah the $40 prepaid samsungs or motorolas are a godsend, the selfie camera may not be the best but if you are using a phone for webcam then the main cam on the back will do the job and have better resolution than the 20yo webcam tech on laptops."
1824,Cats can stream too you know. 😋
1825,"I use Iriun Webcam with my phone,through the usb port.It works perfectly.Its very good.And its basically free,because i have a phone anyway and will always have and the worst phones have at least a 1080p camera its great."
1826,"Elgato just came out with a new camera. It's their first, and also the first that's actually pretty damn good! Give it a search!"
1827,"Next do microphones.  I have several in my collection and a bunch more at work, and the one I have from the early sixties is the one that sounds the most accurate.  Our new Shure SM7B doesn't sound nearly as good and I think cost $400, but it is super good at blocking off background noise.  That's the only thing it is good at.  I know it is famous since Michael Jackson liked it, but I think he liked it for its distortion.  Why can't we make decent microphones for a reasonable price?  Computers and amplifiers keep betting better and better, but not microphones."
1828,"Did you go from a consenser or something? I can't see how the SM7B would sound worse to you otherwise, Shure was the standard for dynamic mics back then and still kinda is. My SM58 is 10 years old but identical to one built in the 60s."
1829,"You're probably just using the wrong microphone for the job. SM7Bs sound great ( they're pretty much the standard for spoken word recording) and, if anything, cheap microphones have only gotten better since they 60s."
1830,microphones need assembly precision. that costs money.
1831,"I think SM7bs sound great. But that depends on the usage, you probably have more technical usage that 7Bs are not built for. I'm actually using an SM57 for my voice before I had an AT 2035. Now the SM57 is permanent on the amp. But is actually doable for voice too. The thing with mics is that most it some work on EQ and leveling."
1832,"The only technology that’s really getting better is semiconductors, which explains the computers and amps. Outside of this though most things are stagnant or progress very slowly. Technology only gets better in very specific and niche ways, but not in the sense that every aspect of it improves, some things just kinda get stuck."
1833,I am fairly sure usb 3.0 would be more than enough.
1834,Last webcam I had was the Logitech 922 and it was pretty good for a 1080p cam. I bet their 4k webcam is better. Conference calls don’t need a good camera tbh. It’s more of a streamer thing to have a good cam
1835,"I'm using a Logitech BRIO. Excellent webcam, but can be problematic for non-Windows users if the firmware is 2.x - they improved functionality for Windows users, but killed it for other operating systems where a phantom second device appears and you get mic drop outs (firmware 2.7 introduces video drop outs too). Any BRIO on 1.x firmware works perfectly, however.  Shame really, since it's such a pricey camera and such a good picture. Oh, and Logitech don't care about the non-Windows market, so they don't allow you to downgrade the firmware either."
1836,"Yes, and it made things worse. The mic generally stays up, but now you get video drop outs!  Got a bunch of BRIO's at work with various 2.x firmwares on them, but the two we have on 2.7 are pretty much useless on non-Windows machines now. For affected machines we've swapped out some 2.4 BRIO's to leave the 2.7's on Windows boxes, and are now using a third party mic with the 2.4's.  My 1.x BRIO at home is going strong and will never get updated.  We live and hope that Logitech will come to their senses and realise there's more than just Windows users out there."
1837,"I trade stocks so I occasionally watch CNBC/bloomberg/etc.  Even their Cisco/Zoom feeds go to garbage depending on the internet. CEOs everywhere.  And it's been a while since COVID now. They just don't care to upgrade their internet or fix shit.  Being billionaires, you would think they would fix it or get dedicated lines. Nope."
1838,"This is what I'm thinking. The video on Zoom, Teams, Webex, etc gets so compressed, it doesn't matter what you start with. I have a Logitech Brio that can do 4K video and I look like everyone else on the call."
1839,"Webcams are not terrible, if you use the webcam applications from Fujifilm, Canon, Sony etc. with their cameras.  All cameras with microscopic lenses and sensors are bad cameras. Especially lenses. It's just physics."
1840,My S10e is better than any webcam. That is not a $1000 phone.
1841,"I completely agree and have been thinking the same recently after trying some ""high end"" webcams. They simply aren't good enough.  Consider this: The sensors in the Logitech Brio (which is approx 1/3"") and Dell Ultrasharp webcam (which is 1/2.8"") are still significantly smaller than even the most budget smartphones. (E.g. the main camera on the Samsung galaxy a52 is 1/1.7""!)  I've moved on to DSLR cameras for streaming and the quality difference is huge, but the price is too (Easily 3-6x more expensive than the ""best"" webcams!).  The problem with DSLRs isn't just the cost though. They are large and they are not suited for webcam use. They often requiring dummy batteries, hdmi connections into capture cards and then require manually switching on when you want to use it! Depending on model it might even start to overheat after a while too   There is definitely a gap in the market for a webcam with something like a 1"" sensor!"
1842,"An Elgato facecam came out recently that looks really nice. The software allows you to change exposure and other settings like a normal camera, which is great. There are a bunch of videos out there that talked about it when it released."
1843,You tried them all? Logitech Brio HD 4K? AVerMedia Live Streamer CAM 513?  Personally I think the Elgato FaceCam looks amazing; even the heatsink for 24/7 streaming (no microphone): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy7XWagX9Hg
1844,"USB webcams don't have nearly enough bandwidth for the extensive image processing phones do, in many cases in dedicated areas of the chip.  ps: you can use your phone as webcam"
1845,USB2 sure.  USB3.2 can handle 4k30 RAW.
1846,Just buy a better one. I got one from lenovo for about $38 CAD and its great. Prices became inflated and the market flooded due to covid.   Also the reddragon one amazon is decent too (but lenovo is better for the price)
1847,"Logitech C920/922 is really neat with the Logitech Capture software tbh, goes for sub €100."
1848,Logitech c920. Its worth the investment from the beginning as a great budget cam and a cam that many streamers still use later into their stream careers.   There are filters and luts you can download to make your setup more aesthetically pleasing. The real secret is you should focus on lighting for your stream.
1849,"Your mobile phone! I use my old iphone 7 as a webcam. Better than a Logitech c920 ! Use the app ""iVCam"" to use your mobile as webcam.The license costs 10$ . Happy streaming 👍"
1850,"Microsoft's Lifecams are a decent budget option, but the detail to look for is the webcam's resolution."
1851,I started streaming in 2013 on a PS2 Eye Toy and used it as my mic too LOL... eventually moved up to a logitech c270 for a year or so then switch to the c920 for the rest of my streaming career
1852,"Save up for a C920, then you won’t have to get a new webcam for a long time. Also, invest in a cheap ring light. Lighting is often just as important as the camera itself, even a 1080p camera looks pixelated in poor lighting."
1853,"I actually like my Razer Kiyo a lot, more than the much lauded c920 from Logitech I had given to my partner since she needed one for WFH. It also saves you needing a ring light!"
1854,"I found mine on Amazon, its a Logitech and works great!"
1855,C920
1856,"I'm using an Aukey 1080p Webcam. I don't know what your budget is, but I got mine because Logitech Webcams are waaaay to expensive right now. I think the quality is fine c:"
1857,Buy cheap buy twice.  &#x200B;  Got logitech c920 or better. Basically Everyone whose anyone uses the c920 it's kinda the standard
1858,"Probably brio is the best webcam what money can buy, why u say is crap?"
1859,Do you have it? If so does the quality come true and crisp? I've seen comparisons and they are very similar to the C922 etc
1860,"The brio is the best webcam you can buy right now but it's not cheap and you need good lighting. The webcam on its own looks ""terrible"" but stick two elgato light and your getting fantastic video quality better than 90% of streamers on twitch. But 2 lights are £240 and the webcam is basically £200. If I was short I cash 100% would be buying good lighting not cheap Amazon crap first. With good lighting you can even make a c920 look very good"
1861,"I've just purchased the Razer Kiyo Pro, and holy damn, i cannot stress enough how this webcam blows everything out of the water, like literately."
1862,"Look at all of Logitechs offerings. If you really want to get the most out of it, you will have to learn about lighting and composition. There are lots of YT videos about it, but they all share the same thought: any camera will suck out of the box... proper (not necessarily expensive) lighting is what will make any shot look amazing. If you have an RTX card, you can have the ability to blur out the background."
1863,do you know much about  Logitech C920 HD Pro Webcams? I was looking at getting one
1864,"IMO my top ticks are the StreamCam first, C922 second, and C920 third. All great cameras. The C920 is the gold standard for webcams. The other 2 have updated performance and features that may or may not fit what you're looking for. Again, I cannot stress how important lighting is. Thats what frustrates me about some of the reviews out there is that they only look at basic out-of-the-box performance and don't try to squeeze the best look out of it."
1865,"C920 pro is pretty good, got one myself...comes with a tripod too if you need! 720p 60fps is buttery smooth and has decent performance in low light."
1866,"DSLR is the obvious choice, but if you don't have that kind of money like me, I use this Vitdae webcam and I've been really impressed with the quality especially at this price point. With good lighting and dialing in your settings/xsplit it's really great [https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Vitade-Streaming-Conferencing-Computer/dp/B07VW6Q9F7/ref=sr\_1\_67?dchild=1&keywords=webcam+with+ring+light&qid=1619733959&sr=8-67](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Vitade-Streaming-Conferencing-Computer/dp/B07VW6Q9F7/ref=sr_1_67?dchild=1&keywords=webcam+with+ring+light&qid=1619733959&sr=8-67)"
1867,I use logitech c922 with a combination of an IKEA work lamp (screwed in white light bulb) plus these:   https://www.amazon.ca/Dimmable-Adjustable-Tabletop-Shooting-Photography/dp/B07T8FBZC2?ref_=ast_sto_dp
1868,I will give the 922 a look!
1869,I think the most common is the logitech c920 or the c922. They are really good webcames especially with good lighting! Hope that helps!
1870,The best webcam won't make you a better streamer. Just find a good auction for one of Logitech cams on eBay. I personally use a Logitech c290e 3 years ago and never needed another one.

1872,"I use the Logitech C920. It's pretty pricey but widescreen, hd, 15 megapixels, and a glass lense. I love it. "
1873,C930e is an improvement. 
1874,"I just bought a used Microsoft LifeCam Cinema for $15 [off Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B002MCZJ78/ref=sr_1_2_olp?ie=UTF8&qid=1376931200&sr=8-2&keywords=lifecam+cinema&condition=used), although the seller has a pretty bad rating (62%). I figured for $15, it was worth a buy. And if there was something wrong with the cam, then I'd just dispute it on Amazon.  I don't know much about the webcam market, but I did a little shopping around and it seems like the Microsoft LifeCam Studio and the Logitech HD Pro C920 are the two flagships. There aren't that many other companies that seem to come close, as all the other webcams I've seen have well under 100 reviews on Amazon."
1875,"I own the LifeCam Cinema and the LifeCam Studio, and they are both great webcams. The Cinema, however, as an autofocus issue that makes it focus in and out every few minutes or so. It's very noticeable. Though for $15, it's an incredibly great value. I wish they could offer better image quality under low light conditions, but pretty much all webcams are like that.  And I've also heard good things about the Logitech camera. I haven't actually owned one myself, but many reviews say its one of the best."
1876,"Does the Studio have the same autofocus issue? If the issue really is as prominent as you say, I'd like to return/resell the Cinema and buy a Studio instead."
1877,"I have the Cinema and Studio both as well; ended up disabling autofocus on the Cinema and adjusting it manually. Since getting the studio, I haven't noticed it doing the same thing, but I also haven't used it nearly as much. If you can get a good deal, go for the Studio"
1878,"I have the Cinema HD as well with an autofocus issue. I'm hoping there's a fix. I've had it for a while now and when I'm in skype, I'll move a bit after a while and it seems to focus all the way out and right back in to a clear image."
1879,I just use the xbox 360 webcam that they used to sell. It actually had a great resolution and it was plug'n'play.
1880,"i have a c520, cheap and does the job, whatev lol"
1881,Logitech HD Pro C920.
1882,I personally use the Logitech c920 webcam.  Based on personal taste. Others may feel other cameras are better but for me I've had zero problems while using it for over a year and a half so far. Plug and play and quick to setup.  Chroma key is a breeze via obs using the c920 as well.
1883,"New streamer here. I use the Logitech C922. It's $99, and honestly worth every penny in my personal opinion. I even tried it with a green screen and a chroma filter and the image quality is crispy and very high quality. Great starter camera. "
1884,I’d save a few bucks and get the 920. It’s the same camera but without their crappy personify chroma cam thing that doesn’t work. Better off doing a chroma key in obs
1885,"There are small differences, like 922 is slightly better for low lighting areas. In my personal case this was relevant, but to be fair personify is actually the worst software and I tend to never use it"
1886,"the 'low light setting"" on the c922 makes it look much better then the c920 for people that dont use professional lighting setups. Also its usually on sale for 50(black friday)-75 dollars. I upgraded from the c920 to the c922 and never looked back. The Personify Chroma cam thing is garbage though and wont use it. "
1887,"If your content is 60fps, and you want your camera to be also, my Brio is immaculate."
1888,I use c922. USB webcams aren't as great as DSLRs but getting proper lights and learning how to set up your webcam (turn off auto settings) will improve quality. This is from my experience.
1889,C920 will forever reset to auto.  Not sure if c922 is the same but if not that would be a selling point for me if I didn’t have one already
1890,You have to install the Logitech software in order to solve this problem.
1891,"The webcams you listed are both USB webcams, which are not as good as DSLR cameras but more than good enough for streaming. There is no need to invest in the most expensive equipment.     Out of the c920 and the c922, the latter is the better model. The c920 can record 30 FPS at 1080p/720p, while the c922 can record 30 FPS at 1080p or 60 FPS at 720p. The c922 can also do some cool background removal effects, similar to what you can get through Nvidia Broadcast's digital green screen."
1892,"You are right, but so many ppl are reviewing 922hd as worst in the quality compare to 920 HD... Its weird in 2021 not able to find quality wrb cam review, YouTube and so many blogs where reviews are done with apparently dumb reviewers... All waste of time... To go thru.   Well I was assuming that in 2021 where ppl have 1gib internet connections it should be good to see relatives on Skype etc in the best quality as possible... We are not living in caves anymore..."
1893,"When I bought a webcam, I was initially going to go with the c922, but after watching reviews ended up buying the Razer Kiyo which sits in the same price bracket. That one might be worth looking into! :)     I have had no issues with the camera at all and am very happy with the quality. It has an inbuilt ring light which does a lot to improve the lighting on my face."
1894,"see this is the thing, i saw a youtube video razer kiyo vs c922hd pro ... basically 0 difference, c922hd pro quality etc was better... so just confusing ...  &#x200B;  what reviews? based on what parameter they claimed kiyo is better... i assume 0 facts, just someone said something. Yes it has a lightning but during the day its not needed that much and during the evening it wont help that much."
1895,thanks  &#x200B;  well maybe its worth to use DSLR or GoPro ... I have sony rx100 ii; it comes with hdmi port... so maybe using [https://www.amazon.com/DIGITNOW-Camcorder-Streaming-Conference-Broadcasting/dp/B08QNCWHHS/ref=psdc\_6795230011\_t2\_B08CH9FC22](https://www.amazon.com/DIGITNOW-Camcorder-Streaming-Conference-Broadcasting/dp/B08QNCWHHS/ref=psdc_6795230011_t2_B08CH9FC22) and some tooling it might work?   &#x200B;  Or to buy go pro ... which is better then stick 80 pounds to camera that has no other way to utilize...
1896,"The C920 is an amazing webcam so I’d be picking that up over the c922 never had any issues with it and it looks great, if the picture looks bad then you probably got poor lighting. Many others share the same opinion that the c920 is better then the 22"
1897,"Thanks for the answer man! I’ve got a Nikon D810, could I connect it to the cam link and stream for 3 hours? Thanks "
1898,"There is literally no reason to any other camera than the C920. The 922 is a pile of hot garbage. But if youre only streaming at 720p, the C920 has the capability of giving you the very best picture a 720p output can display. If you are having issues, I 100% promise you it is a lighting/settings issue. "
1899,"Im thinking of buying a webcam. Is these issues common for this webcam, would the c920 be better? "
1900,"I literally just got off tech support with Logitech about their garbage drivers that don’t save cam settings. I have a 20 and a 22. I definitely agree that the 22 has grainy video even with proper lighting. I’m currently experimenting with their other drivers, they recommended a separate one for each of my cams, instead of just using an aggregate driver.  I’ll let you know if it works, the not saving settings thing has been an absolute pain, but from what I can tell is not OBS’s fault, and rather is Logitech driver issues. "
1901,"If the budget isn’t an issue, I really like the c920 because it has a sort of paleness to it that I like, but the c930e is a noticeable difference when upgrading and it has a nice clear picture and is smooth"
1902,"Thanks a lot man, will check it out. Anything about the BRIO webcam? "
1903,"I’m not familiar with that, I’ve only had the c920 and c930e"
1904,Same issue with natural sunlight.  I find myself having to reset it a lot as the lighting changes in my streaming space (my bedroom which has 5 windows)
1905,"I went for a Razer Kiyo because anything worth it's salt from Logitech was sold out or +$50 compared to the Kiyo. I will say the Kiyo goes in and out of stock on the manufacturer's website often, but I have had no complaints. From what I read, it compares well to Logitech models and comes with a built-in ring light, which is a nice bonus. Just offering an alternative!"
1906,"Another big up for the kiyo. I have a larger ring light that I use now instead of the built in one, but the camera itself is great quality. I was hesitant at first but I'm glad I gave it a shot. (Plus, yeah the logi was out of stock when I first started steaming). Also, if you're into aesthetics, I personally thing it looks pretty rad."
1907,"I've been using an app called ivCam. It basically turns you cell phone into a Webcam and it's been great. If your cell has a good camera, I highly recommend it."
1908,C922 is good
1909,"The price of all web cams right now are inflated because so many people are using video conferencing due to COVID-19.  Many stores are out of stock, and amazon/online sellers are raising their prices.  It's a good question whether the C920 is still worth it, but keep in mind that any other suggestions will also be at inflated prices."
1910,Refurbished cannons are decent if you want to get into filming and pictures. Cannon often has sells and you can get a m50 for only 350$Which usually that stuff runs to about 600 :)
1911,"When looking for a mini tripod, what do I need it to have so it will work with my Logitech Streamcam? The camera from logitech DID NOT include a tripod with it. I was looking at one of the Joby ones. Thanks"
1912,Look for a Logitech C615 it's the same thing just not 60fps
1913,Check out alpha gaming video on the webcams. He compares a couple cheap ones with the BRIO and c920. I went with the Chinese $40 webcam that looks just as good as the c920
1914,"Exactly man, like, I have a Ryzen 3600 with 16gb of ram and I can stream any games nearly perfect. And some people WILL TELL YOU you need at least a Ryzen 7 3700x + 32gb of ram, or a RTX Video card, to use as a stream encoder."
1915,"Plus, r/buildapc would be happy to help after you get an idea of what you are thinking of building, they help make ""budget"" pc's all the time"
1916,If you’re gonna start looking for parts join r/buildapcsales it’s got soooo many deals posted every day. Especially with the holidays/sales this season
1917,I will get down voted for this but you can stream with a inexpensive PC.   Here is a link to a Alpha Gaming Channel video where they were able to stream for less than $150.    [Alpha Gaming Channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gjw5GgjzQs)
1918,"lower chance of frame drops due when streaming at a higher preset due to the extra cores and threads id assume, but the IPC improvement of zen 2 does give a good amount more FPS. 2700x still worth it if you arent picky about that, and if you maybe plan to render things too since the multi core is still faster"
1919,"I bought a Ryzen 7 2700x for a dedicated streaming computer and... well, long story short, it doesn't have integrated graphics. So be aware of that.  I also use this computer when rendering out video files (which I really need to do more often), and it is *substantially* faster at this task than the i7-7700k in my main/gaming rig. I did need to update the UEFI on my board, though. I was having a ton of performance and stability issues before."
1920,If you decide to go with a 2700x then get the 2700 and oc it yourself for additional savings. During the prime day sale I picked up my 2700 for ~150 bucks which was a 50 dollar savings over the 2700x at the time.
1921,32gb ram and ryx video cards arent super expensive. Nothing wrong with those recommendations. Of course 16->32gb is just quality of life though.
1922,"Exactly. I just started streaming a few days ago. Every video, recommendation, discord user has said you need a 3700x. I have a 2600x, and an RTX 2060 and once I figured out my OBS settings. I think it looks pretty good. Now if I could fix the audio......."
1923,So important. No camera even the c920s looks good in darkness
1924,I have an Ikea standing houselight I just drag nexto my PC but offscreen that does the job just fine for now 😂
1925,"I got the c270, I bought it because it was so cheap. It's a great webcam for starting out."
1926,I started with the Microsoft whatever 3000 and with good light it was acceptable.  One of the most important thing with a webcam is lighting.  You can make cheaper look better with good lighting
1927,You can get a c920 for 50 dollars multiple times a year when it's on sale.
1928,"While I agree with you. I would never spend $10k on a Downhill bike, as my first buy, because I don't know if I'm going to like the sport. So I'll get a cheaper $2k bike, if I like, I buy the 10k in the future.      I still will get a good $2k bike, not gonna be cheap and get a $800 bike. However I'll not get the high end.   Of course, it's different when the scale is in the thousands, but it can apply to low end stuff too. the c270 is a $20 cam with really good quality, it's not a $10 webcam, or just a bad cam. So, as you're entering the hobby, it's better not to spend much if you don't have the money."
1929,"That's not really apples to apples though. In the realm of cameras, the 922 isn't the 10k bike or even the 2k bike. It might not even be the $800 bike lol.  I think we can all agree that the bottom line for a twitch webcam is 720p like the c270 and the top of the line would be some pro-camera with an Elgato cam link running HDMI directly into your computer pushing close to $1000.  The 922 isn't even technically the middle ground when it comes to webcams when you look at it that way. Realistically it's one step up from the bottom. That doesn't mean it's not professional quality, but it's definitely not professional gear.  If we were to take the bike analogy the 2k bike would probably be a GoPro. Then you have the option for 1080p with an insane frame rate."
1930,Ive used the c270 for almost 3 years before upgrading to the c920. That little $20.00 is still a work horse. Used it as my secondary for a few moths after the upgrade before giving it to my brother to use... 730p30 is def plenty starting out on any platform but twitch especially.
1931,"I disagree. $70 is not much and you get *such a better* camera. The color *suuuuuuuucks* on the c270.  Lots of people are saying you never go fullscreen. That is wrong, uninteresting streamers never go full screen. Good streamers have tons of different scenes, including full screen for chatting with viewers.  Stream quality is a big part of what attracts follows, shoot high. You don't need a seperate PC with an El Gato and a mirrorless DSLR for a webcam, but seriously don't cheap out on stuff that costs less than a hundred bucks.  Streamers with bad cams and bad mics are a dime a dozen, be better and you'll get attention."
1932,"When it comes to webcams/cameras, people tend to forget that you'll more than likely NEVER fullscreen the camera. So yeah, once you've scaled down the camera in your stream, the total resolution it can output is not as important. Getting something that'll output like, 5XXp and maybe 60fps (like a PSEye camera) is pretty good for a stream. What IS super important is good, balanced, and intense lighting. If you give a camera enough lighting, the picture will be great. If you give one of those cheap logitech webcams very little light, it will look like shit.  However when it comes to stuff like audio and general PC build for single PC streaming setups, I do think a lot more consideration and investment planning should be done. If you go the USB mic route, you are really limiting yourself to that mic. Your only upgrade path is another USB mic. Where as if you took the time to save up a little more, you could get a really decent USB audio interface which would allow you to open up your horizon to hundreds of XLR mics.   Single PC streaming setups have become much better in potential output quality due to the better NVENC encoding options on the newer Nvidia cards. Dual PC setups will still net a better looking stream (and truthfully makes your stream less of a pain with everything stream related getting offloaded to another PC) but you can now achieve pretty great results with single PC setups."
1933,In the UK here but I got the C920 for around the $20 mark on a sale once before I even started streaming
1934,"As an avid c270 user, you really don't need anything else for 720p streaming and decent room lighting. We have those fancy 100€+ Logitech cams at work and they're certainly better, but not 80€+ better."
1935,"Hey man thanks for this, I already have a really insane pc but I just decided to get into streaming and I was about to drop a lot of money on a webcam cause I figured I needed a good one if I wanted to get any kind of viewers but I just ordered the c270 cause I realized that I’m just starting and I’m doing it for fun so I shouldn’t invest to much money!"
1936,"Disagree. If you’re just testing the waters, don’t bother with a camera. If you decide you like streaming, don’t waste money on a 270 and get a 920/922 later. Just get the 920/922 first and be done with it. It’s still a budget camera, it’s not expensive at all and it can be found on sale often. The quality is also a LOT better than the 270. Not talking about pixels, but colors and the way it handles light are all much better. Besides you can use a webcam for more than just streaming."
1937,"I'd argue that buying the *right* first camera is better to do before you spend $20 on a camera you'll end up replacing. It's not like the webcam will be useless if you find that streaming is not for you, plus reselling the *right* camera is easy, whereas nobody wants your secondhand $20 camera.  If I want to start playing the guitar, as an adult, I'm not going to go out and buy a $5000 guitar and amp and pedals, but I'm also not going to start off with the $50 walmart brand I KNOW I'll immediately want to replace.  It's about value. The Logitech C920/930 is *really* great bang for your buck."
1938,When I started out I had a C270 aswell. What disturbed me the most was the „Field of View“ because the camera had to be far away from you to get you on screen. I have a C920 since some months now and I‘m happy.   But for starting out its okay. :)
1939,I keep mine far away.. with the wide angle lense the c920 can make your face look wider than it is if it's too close . I just use the zoom feature to get closer in.
1940,"I agree with you about 90%. I started with a c270 myself and, yes it was ""good enough"", but now it's a year later and I have 2 c922's and a GoPro that gets used occasionally and the 270 is a $20 paperweight.   I had the money on the front end for the 922 and wish I had just gone with it from the start, but if you, or whoever, doesn't have the money then the 270 is a great little budget camera. That's assuming you spend the $30 you saved on lighting for it. You could buy a DSLR and it would look like garbage if your lighting isn't right."
1941,I mean you can always buy a used one as well for cheap. I got C920 for 20$ off Facebook and works perfect.
1942,Amazon just did a sale on the C920 for €25 so I bought it. I was using a DSLR + Capture card and flipped backwards for the convenience. Even using Magic Latern the DSLR still auto timed off the live video every 30 minutes. Webcam is plug and play and honestly once you tweak the settings it's not a whole lot different.
1943,"With DSLR you need a dummy battery(assuming your DSLR is common search for the model name of your battery with the words dummy battery and it will popup online)... to bypass the powered on limit.  The only reason to be using DSLR is if money is not an issue or you already owned one, if you want a way higher quality, depth of field and 60fps. If you do not really care about those obviously its way simpler and way cheaper to just be using a webcam - exactly like you said its just plug n play."
1944,But the c920 mic isnt half bad so if your needing a cheap start and are trying to pick between a mic and a webcam you get both...... Also it won't overheat or fall apart like many cheap knockoffs do.
1945,"As someone who has streamed for about 10 months with a c270, I would agree that it fits needs of a basic webcam. I did switch to a c920 though and will say it makes a HUGE difference. If you are just trying to figure out if you want to be a streamer, sure, the c270 is going to be fine. If you want to be on the same playing field as most other streamers though, you want a c920 or better. A good quality webcam, a good quality microphone, and a good overlay/alerts are all a standard of streaming these days and do not make you stand out. They are a minimum now unless you have something else that makes you really stand out."
1946,I have both the 270 and a 920 and for the most part they are both very nice cameras.  I noticed the 270 takes a more zoomed in picture than the 920 does when they are side by side on top of the same monitor  I think the 270 is a great starter cam
1947,I’m just starting and got a c920 used on OfferUp for $20...
1948,My camera is mid range decent at best but gets the job done. I do need more PC parts to stop my games from shitting themselves while I stream however. Can’t even stream R6S
1949,"My rig is so slapped together! I want bore you with the stats but it consists of old computer parts that I either saved from the landfill or someone gave me something when they upgraded their gaming computer. I have a tendency to hoard old tech. I found a Blue Spark Digital mic for half the normal price because it had been returned to Amazon. Only thing wrong is that they threw the wrong mic stand back in the box which I don't use anyway, and the USB port is a little hinky sometimes. I originally for the mic for singing. I just bought a desk mounted spring loaded mic stand for 13 bucks which they actually sent me 2 for the price by the way. I will also be buying some chroma key fabric for 10 bucks soon. Everything else I already had."
1950,"logitech c615 can be found much mroe readily used than the c270... and for like 5 bucks. I have 3. Get that.  edit: Facecam, roomcam, & VR LIV cam"
1951,"True, I started out with a very very cheap webcam from the 2000’s era, kinda just put together what I had. Over the years I upgraded to the C920, although, i’m not big on streaming, its actually a very professional option used by many studios for video work, including company I work for. If you’re into filmmaking, its the choice of professionals, i’ve used it for a few projects, great quality, but very expensive for a hobby. And a total waste if its going to collect dust"
1952,"I agree , I kind of pushed off streaming for a couple of years due to personal issues. And the last year and a half I was like okay I need to do this and kind of was in the impression that I needed everything top class and was a bit intimidated. But decided let's just roll the dice and got the logitech c920 when it went on sale over the summer for like $35, doing it on a decent laptop (not a gaming or top end) and was running my mic for stream off the webcam. It was pretty decent once you tweak it and set some filters on it. My biggest purchase was the el gato. And recently just saved up to get a hyperx quadcast mic to try it out since it was $40 off over the weekend."
1953,"I started in 2018 on an old refurb dell optiplex i5 from 2012, 3 c270’s (one for face, one for midi controller, one flex cam- guitar headstock mount/doggo cam/guest camera, and an elgato hd60 i found on fb marketplace for 25 bucks. Was fine, no complaints, running an ASUS GL703, Strix Hero Edition, 1 c920 and 2 c270’s now and for screen capture I’m running an ethernet hub and doing it via NDI now"
1954,"I bought a c920 not just for streaming, I also bought a Razer Seiren Microphone not just for streaming.  You can still purchase good gear if you want to, they have more uses than just for streaming, if you're looking to drop some dosh on high end gear but are worried that it'll go to waste on streaming, think about what else they can used for."
1955,"But I never said someone shouldn't buy the c920. I SPECIFICALLY SAID, ""There is no need in spending more than $20 on a webcam if you're starting."" on a TWITCH reddit. So I'm specifically saying that you don't need to buy a c920 if you're starting as a streamer. You could buy it, of course, but there are other options.     I created this post, because after asking people here, it seemed that the only webcam I could possibly buy for streaming was the c920, when in reallity, the $40 cheaper c270 is good enough."
1956,"The only reason I still recommend the c920 is because it regularly goes on sale for half off everywhere, and dollar for dollar, it will retain quality and give a huge bang for your buck.  Buying something cheap and then going to a 920 in a year isn't helpful cuz it's much more expensive to do so long run. Better to just not use a cam save another 20 or 30 bucks and buy the half price 40 or 50 dollar c920.  It's not like you need to save up an extra 100 bucks - it's 20 or 30. You can do that shovelling some driveways or mowing some lawns for a few extra bucks."
1957,"I picked up an ASUS TUF laptop from Best Buy, Ryzen 7 3750H for 650 bucks, they had an even better deal on Black Friday for 550. It runs every AAA title effortlessly. Never had any issues streaming. If you position the lid correctly...you could even us the built in webcam."
1958,"Some equipment I agree, but something as basic as a webcam that can be used just to chat with family or friends I wouldn't encourage going under the baseline C920. (which is like 50 or 60 bucks).  If it doesn't work out for streaming, at least you still have a great 1080p webcam."
1959,"I agree, I bought a $20 cam from Target when I first started. As long as your light source is fine (use a spare phone or your phones flashlight) then you’ll be Gucci"
1960,(Used) C920 or any 720p + some proper DIY lighting should do the job great.
1961,"I have the C270. If you override the exposure to -5 or -6 in OBS's camera settings and set your own brightness, whitdbalance, and other settings with good lighting, it actually looks like a really good webcam. You'll only really notice the quality reduction if you're streaming higher than 720p and you go for a full cam view scene."
1962,"Go to r/buildapcforme and ask there, they'll happily help you out. $1000 is definitely possible to build a full setup. $800 for the pc and $200 for monitor, keyboard and mouse"
1963,C920 is 40 bucks rn
1964,"This is entirely true. I also would like to claim that you don't need to throw hundreds on an expensive mic. Heck, the mod mics today are even good enough. And also there are more affordable options for mics on the desk/on a stand. Here in Europe, Superlux is a good brand for that stuff. They make copies of brand-name products that are still good quality, just at about half of the price."
1965,Superlux makes the drives that are on akg headphones. Correct me if im wrong
1966,Could very well be. I have some of their headphones and I'd say they're not at all far from the model (usually Sennheisers) they were going for.
1967,"I still have and use a C270- it's fine for a face cam and if you have(had) poorer internet like me it's likely you can only pump out good 720p.  I started streaming with a dual core laptop with AMD graphics just to see if I liked it  (Not games though... when I attempted that for a week or two the computer overheated) and upgraded PCs when things got really moving.  Some of the fastest growing game based content creators I've seen don't even have a webcam.  As long as your voice sounds decent, and your content has enough pixels, it's all about your personality really.   I would definitely say that you should start doing more than you should be theorising.  A lot of my initial thoughts about streaming changed (and continue to change) as I'm doing it longer and longer."
1968,Agree but also look for used c920s on fb marketplace or OfferUp before you buy a cheaper one. Got my second one for $25
1969,"I agree completely. Im actually using my old iPhone 7 with a webcam app, because I have no idea if my streams will be anything and I dont entirely feel like splurging on tech for it if I dont need to. Plus it outputs 1080p footage if I need it to, so it works for now."
1970,Most phones have cameras that easily perform as good as a 100 bucks webcam. I was astonished how good the quality of my huawei p20 lite was. A cheap webcam is probably worse than most phones.
1971,Now with corona you can add a 0 to the $20 lol
1972,"Also got a C270 to start and am still using it. Have you figured out how to set the exposure manually? I play at night and the light from my monitor over exposes my face, besides that it works fine"
1973,duke above columbia is bold
1974,Brown above Columbia too lmao I think Caltech and Columbia lead the 6-10 without a doubt
1975,I'd say Stanford should be at #2 or at least in Princeton's place.
1976,"US News and WSJ use ""faculty resources"" as a pretty big metric. This disadvantages places like UT Austin and UW Seattle, since they're public schools.  Georgia Tech is a STEM powerhouse, but I presume Case has a more broad focus.  at the end of the day, I think it's fair they're in the same bracket, and I think it's best to not really consider such tiny differences."
1977,"yup.   Each school has different strengths though, UIUC is T5 for CS/Engineering, GT is T10 for engineering/cs, UT is t10 for engineering CS, business, UW is at that level for cs and life sciences/pre med etc, UCSD incredibly well rounded.   To me, those are all STEM T25-30's easily, emphatically, beyond a shadow of a doubt.   And all of them shine in global ranks like AWRU, THE (globals) which measure STEM faculty research prowess. These schools are an incredible opportunity to learn from geniuses for a much lower price."
1978,"Penn should be above Brown, JHU should be a bit higher, Stanford should be higher than Princeton, Columbia should be #6 or 7  I think you really nailed 15-25 (which is the hardest part). GTech is probably too low"
1979,"Yeah. For Hopkins to move up, someone else needs to move down, and tbh, I don't see who would move down. Maybe NU, Brown or Dartmouth? But imo those are atleast as prestigious as JHU (outside of med/pre med), and I think it's up to the person at that point .  Penn is probably a bit more prestigious than Brown, but I also think Brown has it's own advantages. People picking between Penn and Brown don't need rankings lmao. And, Columbia could also probably be higher, but I think Caltech at 6 is pretty fair, so maybe 7.  If it was up to me, Stanford would be number 1 or 2 lol."
1980,You talk about HYPSM as the T5 but I don't see Stanford anywhere in the rankings?
1981,Caltech at 6 and brown at 7 make approximately zero sense
1982,Lol Brown at #6 is a bold choice
1983,"funny because I always remembered it at number 7...  ^(you saw NOTHING)  And, also to respond to your point, I don't actually think it's unfair. Brown is as or more selective than Penn and peers, offers a arguably better undergraduate experience, and I would say I always saw it as a T10. It's almost definitely a peer to Penn.   For example, Brown beats Chicago in cross admits by a bit, and loses to Penn and Duke by a bit (i.e. <10% margin) so it's fair to say Brown can compete with this set for undergraduate."
1984,"Building off of your point, I often see Penn being described as more prestigious than Brown (and Dartmouth, for that matter). That’s probably true in some circles, but I’ve always thought differently.   Brown and Dartmouth are more like liberal arts colleges than they are graduate-level research universities, given their relative sparseness of grad programs and avowed focus on undergrads. This sinks their rankings but shouldn’t diminish their institutional reputations. As an undergrad there, both in allocation of resources and position in the social/cultural fabric of the university, you’re the protagonist. That’s a pretty great position to be in at an Ivy League school.  Meanwhile, Penn is basically a tad-less-prestigious cast of the same mold as Harvard, Columbia, and Stanford (to some extent): undergrad is just one school among a sea of grad programs. Unless you’re at Wharton, there’s no caveat like for Dartmouth and Brown: it’s just not quite as prestigious as some of its peer research universities. Moreover, Penn’s overall reputation is inflated by Wharton (as others in this thread have suggested), and its acceptance rate is deflated by the same (though it’s still less selective in aggregate than Brown)."
1985,Wharton > Brown > UPenn - I say this as a Brown student
1986,The school I end up at > Wharton > Brown > UPenn   I say this as a high school senior.
1987,Huh. I've honestly never heard of anyone refer to or think of Brown as a top 10 school.
1988,"Hmm, I always thought of Brown as a T10, but I don't think it really matters. If someone picking between Columbia Penn and Brown wants to use rankings to pick, their loss lol"
1989,"Yes lol, I meant to say solely rankings.   I just don't think Brown, Columbia and Penn are different enough in prestige/ranking to use rankings. It's not like you're comparing Columbia and Chico State, where rankings would be helpful.   And, yea it is a ranking but it would be dumb to use this to pick between Brown, Penn and Columbia too."
1990,"Idk the way I see it in terms of preteige (with no experience whatsoever lmao) is Columbia, UPenn, brown but I think that’s also cause Columbia and UPenn are in bigger cities and because of that just have more opportunities in general"
1991,"yeah but so does every other school from number 1 to 13. You can make some legit arguments for Hopkins to be higher, but it shouldn't be a contest of endowments at that level."
1992,idk man UCLA is too low
1993,"I would put UT Austin and Georgia Tech higher but other than that I agree with this list more than any other ranking list. That being said, I don’t really know a ton about every school so I can’t really say this with certainty."
1994,"UT Austin, GA Tech, Purdue, UIUC, UW Seattle, and UCSD to me are easily T30 for STEM. Their outcomes reflect that too, though. They all place excellently into grad school, UW/UCSD more than the others place excellently into medical school.   All great, highly similar schools."
1995,"Yeah I agree. Obviously if this were deciding top school for their focal point, schools like UIUC would be close to the top. Which is why giving colleges an overall ranking is tough, as it depends what kind of school you’re looking for."
1996,"Here's the thing--all the rankings could be more accurately replaced with US News' academic reputation ranking. But you have to pay to unlock that/buy the magazine to see it, so instead everyone relies on a weird methodology that doesn't quite work to dream up the prestige of different colleges."
1997,Not me checking to make sure my dreamie isn't on this list because then I won't get in.
1998,"I always saw Brown as more prestigious than Northwestern.   It offers stronger undergrad education, and is harder to get into, and 65% of people who get into Brown and Northwestern pick Brown."
1999,"True with regard to the harder to get into part, though my comment was just intended to say that ""there's absolutely no way Brown should be in front of Northwestern"" is probably false.   Brown is famous for offering a objectively strong undergraduate education, especially when compared to other top schools."
2000,"dartmouth has always been number 1 undergrad for like the last 5 years, but slipped a bit a year ago, still is 4th best ivy"
2001,Emory is ranked 21. Everything above Emory is top 20. People don't see NYU as the same because it's ranked 30.  You cannot combine rankings as the methodologies for each one are vastly different. If you combine them you essentially aren't controlling for anything.  ( And how would this work if for instance GAtech is 35 on US news and 71 on WSJ...Why is it only 41 then?)
2002,"After scaling the rankings, I then resorted them. So, my theory of why GA Tech got to 41 is because when I re sorted, I didn't include LAC's.  Without LAC's on WSJ, GA Tech would be around 45-50. So, then this 41 average makes more sense."
2003,I am almost positive you did this incorrectly. If you took out LAC's then Emory would be 21 on both US news and WSJ and a few other irregularities like Columbia and such.
2004,"This one has Forbes, albeit weighted less which slides Emory down. I also did one without Forbes which I didn't post (although I can, I guess), since they don't have a ranking this year, and seem to be less reliable.   In the one without Forbes, Emory is 20, mainly because though UCLA is higher on US News and CMU is higher on WSJ, both are lower on average."
2005,Ya post that too to give a clearer picture. Forbes is really a messy ranking so a post without Forbes would give a solid picture. Post it if you can
2006,Emory is def T20 what are you on lmao
2007,"Georgetown >> USC/WashU/ND/UCLA though. Outcomes are not even close. Might as well be racing an f1 car @ k1 speeds lmao.  You may have an argument in the context of aggregate research output, but most ppl on r/a2c, if not all, are looking for an undergraduate experience.   Gtown is easily t15 for undergrad, and my mind is set on that."
2008,How is northeastern not even on that list rippp
2009,"Northeastern was the next one. It did see a pretty big split though. Forbes ranks them very low inexplicably, (well because they use 4 yr grad rate, so i didn't use NEU forbes)  Out of the other, more well known rankings, US News has them at 49, and WSJ/Times has them at 83 (including LAC's). So they miss out by a little."
2010,But I think they are better than Purdue though right? They have a much lower acceptance rate...
2011,"Purdue has an excellent engineering, CS, science, and math program. It's a world class STEM university.  Don't judge a school by it's acceptance rate. Then we'd consider SDSU better than UCSD which isn't true. Purdue has a small in state population, so a high acceptance rate. Purdue is a world class university.  I don't consider Northeastern as good of a school as Purdue since Purdue is a STEM powerhouse."
2012,"I think this is why rankings suck lmao. It’s so subjective, I think the fact that I’m from the northeast makes me see northeastern as much better than Purdue, because frankly I never heard of that school before this sub."
2013,"Purdue? I'm from Nevada, and I'd heard of Purdue a lot, never of Northeastern lol."
2014,Idk man lol my friend got into northwestern and everyone was like “have fun in Boston” “northeastern is such a good school” and he had to be like I’m going to Chicago and northwestern is better it was pretty entertaining ngl
2015,"Well it's sort of like saying ""people think that Lehigh is better than UChicago"" or ""people think that George Washington is better than Yale"" or ""people think that Villanova is better than Cornell"". You're gonna get pushback because it's an inaccurate statement based on most metrics people are looking at. It is just not an opinion held by the vast, vast majority of people."
2016,"For me the Forbes ranking was not really relevant. First it uses very suspect data, like Payscale and Rate my professors.com etc, which I don't have any faith in. It also favors particular majors, doesn't take into account the fact that the coasts are more expensive to live in etc. I feel that my outcome will be dependent on my major, where I choose to live, etc. Since I don't plan to major in Engineering which skews the salary data in a big way, I did not want to make my decision based on Forbes's output based ranking. I wanted to focus on input based measures for myself  I am sure for some the Forbes ranking makes more sense. For me it did not. I am focused on attending an academically good university. I don't want to judge that decision on ""what becomes of my peers, once they graduate"""
2017,"Yeah IMO Forbes, although not really considered by most people because of it's ""against the norm"" rankings, is actually one of the more accurate lists out there. Also, OP this ranking is seriously good, it seems to match the overall consensus here a lot more than most rankings. /u/acadranking   **Edit:** Also, a general question - why are LACs excluded in a lot of rankings like US News?  Ok what did I say something wrong... why is this downvoted lol."
2018,Pomona is for you 
2019,Thank you. I do plan to look seriously at LAC's as well!
2020,Where's UT?
2021,"Thank you for that suggestion. I have been thinking about the UK universities. I like the fact that it is easier to figure out if you will make it or not, because they are very clear on what they are seeking from an academic standpoint.   The thing as you suggested though is that they also force you to specialize very early and the system is very different from the US system in terms of a well rounded liberal arts curriculum.   Besides my Mom is kind of nervous to send me so far away :-) but they are also on the list for now!  "
2022,They messed up big-time by not including Grand Canyon University in the Top 10.
2023,"Maybe in the top-20, but as you go further up there are some schools that seem to be far out of place. BYU at 31? Carnegie Melon at 42 (behind UGA at 41?????) RPI at 95, yet WPI sits at 42 (similar schools, but RPI is no doubt more prestigious). UC Merced ahead of UC Riverside..."
2024,"It's a meta ranking. If several of the sources rank school A ahead of school B and students like going to school A more than school B, then A will be ahead of B.   I think CMU took a hit because it's student ratings are not stellar. "
2025,Why tf is BYU so high? It's an objectively terrible place to go to college if you aren't a devout Mormon
2026,Weather
2027,Hot weather = more outdoor activities and less clothes so people are incentivized to get in shape and look more attractive. I guess that’s why Southern Florida and California have some of the best looking people.
2028,bump ^
2029,"For researching colleges, I would recommend finding the differences within the ""basic differences"". like you said most schools can end up sounding really similar so here are some ways I guaged whether I would actually like it there (and depending on who you are, these might be differently prioritized for you):  1. Size: often low student-to-faculty ratio is paraded as this magic number, implying a high level of support but it just measures the number (not how it plays out). I would look into the average class sizes—do you want class sizes to be small and intimate, or do you not mind having large lectures?  2. Undergraduate Support: I think this would be less important for some, but how accessible are opportunities for undergrads? Would you be competing with graduate students? Do you mind mainly being taught by teacher assistants (usually graduates, more likely to occur in a bigger school), or would you prefer to be taught by professors (a staple of a smaller school)?  3. Campus setting!! A lot of people already mentioned weather, but I would also say considering the setting as in whether it's rural, suburban, or urban can play a big part in how much you would enjoy the school. It could also factor in the opportunities available e.g. if you're in a big city, you may have more opportunities BUT are you someone that doesn't really like the hustle and bustle of the city-scene? In more regards to unis, large urban areas can be more isolating OR have a more thriving social scene—in this case you'd have to research how current students would describe it.  4. Campus Culture!! (The vibes - I liked watching YouTube Day in the Life for this one too) This is a huge one in my opinion. This is solely based on your priorities and how you wanna spend the next ~4 years of your life. How many of the students are involved in greek life? Is there big party culture? How are sports prioritized? I think each of these have implications of their own. For instance, Dartmouth has an extremely high student participation rate in greek life compared to other Ivies and that has often been associated with increased rape culture, ""fratty"" culture, and negative implications of forming those social hierarchies. BUT   if you would like a party scene, then it's up to you!   5. Diversity: this may be just because I grew up abroad, but I prioritized more diverse schools. You can find the diversity statistics of each school if you're interested.   6. Clubs and strength of the programs you're interested in. Also, simply if they even have the program you want (you'd be surprised how many people apply to schools that don't even have their preferred major)  7. Price and how they expect you to pay or offer financial aid: is it loan-based, do they have merit-based scholarships, do they meet full demonstrated need etc.?  8. Do you want liberal arts education? What kind of curriculum do you like?   Also, of course you may not know what your exact preferences are yet, but this could be a good start to research universities! Like some others mentioned, Reddit and Quora threads were a nice way to find more genuine opinions!  If you want to find more universities you like, you can put in parameters you like and explore the results and also find out what the universities you like consider important/not important: https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-search  Hope this helps! ^^.^"
2030,maybe try to look into fly-in programs? ik most of them are closed rn but some are open! my mentor really stresses the importance of “fit” so yes check them out 🤪free vacation too. and there are programs like Reed Junior Scholars and Dartmouth Bound that give insights to their schools and the application process.
2031,The Reed one is open to everyone!
2032,"The best thing I did was get the Fiske Guide to Colleges. It gives an unbiased overview of a bunch of college, and helps you get a sense of what things you’d like in a school (ex: Greek life, campus housing, male to female ration, undergrad size, etc)."
2033,"The Hidden Ivies by Howard Greene has pretty good summaries of all the top schools, with info on school goals and advantages and standout majors/programs"
2034,"I used CollegeBoard's college search thing. While it didn't really help me choose where to apply, it did help me choose my final choice. Fiske's guide is also a good source "
2035,Buy a Fiske guide to colleges.  It's the best starting point.
2036,"cappex, collegeboard, ed navigator"
2037,"I use the [AAU (American Association of Universities) membership](http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476) as a better proxy of what R1 used to mean. It's basically a subset of the RU/VH classification, and exclude some less research-reputable school."
2038,You know R1's when you see 'em.
2039,"This may be completely wrong, since when I had this question last year I had significant trouble finding a definitive answer, but I think another thing that matters in distinguishing between R1/R2/SLAC is the amount of teaching that professors are expected to do. At an R1 school teaching is relatively low priority, while at SLAC (selective liberal arts consortium) teachers have a much larger course load. R2 falls somewhere in between; they are expected to keep an active lab but may also teach a few classes per semester. "
2040,"""slac"" is small liberal arts college I think."
2041,"I did my undergrad at the U of South Dakota. It's a good school with a PhD program in many subjects, but far from a D1 school."
2042,"Put away the rankings books. If you can afford it, invest in these books or look for them in a library. Or look for their websites.  The Fiske Guide.  Colleges that change lives.   Where you go is not who you are by frank Bruno.  The Insiders Guide  to Colleges by Yale daily news.  The College Finder by Steve Antonoff.  The Hidden Ivies by Howard Green.   These are my favorite books. I also like Princeton reviews top 371 book. "
2043,niche gives lots of student reviews and rankings by major that are somewhat valid
2044,"Good on you for being open to other majors and realizing that rankings aren't everything :)  Unigo and Niche have great sections that are ""student reviews"" of the college. I liked reading them to get a sense of what it was like to be on campus. **Definitely** check these out.  Similarly, admissions blogs are very helpful for this--MIT was the pioneer for these and IMO, have the best ones :P http://mitadmissions.org/blogs  College Scorecard is a great place to get baseline info about a college. Same with eh Common Data Sheets.  College Websites! Bruh, literally just going onto the college website and looking at their mission statement, the criteria that they like to apply when selecting students, what they look for, etc., really helped me understand what kind of students are going to be at that schools :P  USNWR, but SOLELY to help me find colleges to research. I basically just looked up top 100 schools at ____, read through the list, noted down the ones that I was remotely interested in, and then just kept narrowing it down by doing more and more research. I agree with you--these ranking basically mean jack shit for undergrad, especially if you want high teaching quality. But, they're a good place to *Start*, but not beyond that. If you're intersted in multiple majors and have any idea about which other ones you might be interested in, see if there's overlap between these rankings for those majors :P  And finally, weirdly, their meme pages. They give you a very interesting insight into the personality of the students."
2045,"I think its because of the density of the Universities. As far as i am aware most of the highly ranked Unis are in Paris, which this plot doesn't show too well"
2046,"Same might be true for Argentina that somebody mentioned in another comment. Most research comes from CONICET, a state entity."
2047,"Many universities are in Paris and hence are not very visible on this map. Also, many of the top French students don’t go to university but to highly selective and smaller schools (Grandes Écoles). Although I don’t know how much this latter point matters since I believe that most research in France is still conducted within universities."
2048,"France has a slightly different system in that the top schools are not actually universities, but *grandes écoles* eg. École Centrale, écoles des mines, supélec, école normale supérieure etc..  So the top schools may not actually be in this map.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandes_écoles"

2051,"There are many of these indexes. This one in particular seems to be sponsored by Elsevier and the map is based only on the 'Research' aspect. The website is not very clear, but the ranking criteria seems to be published papers per professor. This is not about teaching.  Anyway, I was really surprised to find UNC in that map. Some local newspaper will surely make a huge story about this."
2052,"Assuming you mean UNC chapel hill, why is that surprising? It’s a top 5 public school in the US"
2053,National University of Cordoba
2054,"Yeap. The data this map uses is kinda fishy if the UNC appears but the UBA doesn't. Furthermore, the Balseiro should be there. There's nothing like the Balseiro in LATAM. It's the mini MIT of Argentina."
2055,You mean nothing like ITA or IME in Brazil?
2056,The balseiro is in another completely different category
2057,"The thing is, should I choose staying in UBA or going to Balseiro if like more theoretical physics?"
2058,Balseiro hands down.  But you should have a solid foundation already. The entry exam is brutal.
2059,"Balseiro is the too notch university for highly speciañiced engineer, to enter you must have done at least 2 years of ingeneering education on another univercity, and then pass a hard af test, and then they interview you, the good thing is that if you are in they cover all your living expenses"
2060,Go UNC!
2061,More Argentina.
2062,"All 8 if you look closely, zoom in and Chch definitely has 2, think Auckland does also"
2063,"This is silly. For Europe, it mostly shows how centralized a country is. Take France, all of its top universities are in Paris (many of them), so only one dot is visible there. They're all small universities too (as compared to American ones), so you end up with several medium-sized dots on top of each other. Take Italy or Germany that have lots of medium-size cities of equal power with a a good/decent university in each, and you end up with tons of orange all across the place. Even though France's research output is between Italy's and Germany's.  You end up with a population map, with a very visible [blue banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Banana)."

2066,"Along with BU and several other universities within a 10-20 mile radius in the Boston area.  Edit: MIT is number 5, Harvard is 6, BU is 70, Tufts is 169, UMass is 191, Northeastern is 193, Brandeis is 201-250 (not sure why they give a range there), and BC is 301-350.  MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, UMass, BC, and BU are all within 5 miles of each other, Tufts is an extra 5 miles away, and Brandeis is another 5."
2067,Where do you see BC as being that low? I’ve always seen it as a bit better than BU

2072,"For France another important point was not mentioned earlier: A lot of universities, graduate school or research institues have multiples campus with one official administrative headquarter in Paris. Some institutes ares ""network"" of universities. The heading of a french research paper could be really misleading regarding where the research took place. The actual name and place of the lab could be in the third or fourth position.    For example, for my master thesis, the first name was Paristech, it is a network Parisian engineering school (Only one of them still have a campus inside Paris), the second name was the Paris head quarter of the school, third the name was the industrial partner, and fourth was the actual lab at a campus in the east of France.  The same happen in all field (CNRS, INRIA, EHESS).  This is done on propose. The small institutions could not get international visibility without regrouping. So now every institution in part of a network, federation, mother institution with a fancy Parisian adresse and all research seem to come from Paris."
2073,france has also a system of schools beside universities (napoleon legacy)
2074,"And Germany does a lot of research outside of universities (Fraunhofer, Planck, Helmholtz, Leibniz etc.), hence both countries don't perform good on those ""how British is your university""-rankings. "
2075,"Yeah of course I'm including grandes écoles when I say ""universities""."
2076,"The exact opposite is true here in Singapore. The government wanted to boost their ranking they essentially funding a lot of research, many pointless, through the universities. This boosted their rankings and got more foreigners to enrol.   I think our Mechnical Engineering is like 3rd best in the world. Did not feel that way when I was there. Place had a lot of professors who taught only because they had to, and exams were ripped off from previous years. "
2077,> but not for the humanities.  that depends. there are disciplines within the humanities that aren't even taught outside of applied sciences universities (like social work studies). The reality is a bit too complex to map it onto these simple ranking algorithms. 
2078,"Universities of Applied Sciences (= the former FHs in Germany) are a thing in Scandinavia and other countries, too. This is why indicators for learning experience and research output shouldn't be easily mixed as it is done in these rankings. "
2079,"This mostly applies to countries where higher education isn't state sponsored, so, mainly to the US, UK, and many Asian and commonwealth countries.  But the general gist of your criticism would be that quality of teaching and quantity/quality of published output have little to do with each other, a point I would very much agree with. There are a lot of Unis not on these lists that probably provide a better learning experience for students than those higher ranked."
2080,"I agree and I mentioned this in another comment: the lack of reward for verification, reproduction, cross-checking and so on is the other side of the same coin.   I guess it depends on the specific discipline, but I get the feeling that a lot of reviewers want something to be ""new"" only insofar as it stays well within the established paradigms. *really* new approaches often get buried pretty quickly.   And there are whole disciplines where the epistemological foundations are more than shaking. Heck, within economics, for instance, some rebels had to found the movement of ""pluralist economics"" whose core demand is that economics doesn't style itself as a natural science with monocultural methods as the past 150 years have shown time an again that this doesn't really to the everday reality of markets. The groupthink can get pretty bad."
2081,I was never able to trust the Guardian's ranking simply because it jumped so much from year to year. I always preferred the Times'. 
2082,"Dude, nice idea, but your data is kinda funny. Im latinamerican and I can tell you that at least Argentina, Chile and Peru look weird. If U Antofagasta (I guess) is there, at least UBA and Catholic University of Peru should also be there."
2083,"This index is based on reasearch scores. I suppose that the chilean universities focuse more on the reasearch work than in the education, that´s why they are so overrepresented. UBA it´s for sure a top 3 university in LATAM, but the research work over there isn´t the greatest, because most of the public reasearch in Argentina it´s carried out by the CONICET, and the pubic universities focus on the educational prospect.  I´m not informed about the peruvian sistem of universities, but if i had to guess, i suppose the same is happening over there.  In conclussion it´s a nice index to meassure reasearch works, but it´s not so good at the time of meassuring which are actually the best universities around the world (developing an index to measure a concept so abstract as what makes a University better than others it´s not a easy task)."
2084,[cough] china [cough]
2085,"Ok, anyone else having a problem with the Great Lakes of North America not being depicted on this map? Being from Ohio, this looks like the cartographer just said ""eff it, nobody cares about stupid lakes anyways, I've got rules to follow."""
2086,"Yep, as a GIS user I'm always sad when Michigan gets left off maps. Michigan Tech isn't on the list and neither are the other 2 universities I went to in Missouri or South Dakota."
2087,"Very questionable rankings based on the website you used.  Not sure about the fact that Arizona State is better than Tufts, Case Western, Univeristy of Rochester, AND Notre Dame. "
2088,"Norte Dame is a great undergraduate university, but their graduate programs are far from the best. ASU does Well with some science and Astro programs, but I’m surprised they’re so high too."
2089,I think I see the University of New Orleans and the University of Copenhagen on there. Undergrad and grad :)
2090,University of Missouri probably should not be on that list anymore. The school has gone to utter shit. It was mostly only a party school anyways besides nursing and journalism and their journalism department is getting shit because all the professors are leaving and going to Missouri state university. 
2091,Glad StonyBrook University is listed. They help run Brookhaven National Labs which has the rhic and is one of the partners for the LHC
2092,"Well, Iran does have good universities. I bet there would be more in the Middle East if the rankings weren't based only on English\-language publications. "
2093,"Good to see Bergen university does something right. Top 1000! As a student I wouldn't place Bergen university on my top 3 list of universities I've studied at, and I've only been to 2"
2094,"Wait, how the hell did GW manage to be so high? We’re like 60ish in USNews and WSJ, are we that much higher up in Forbes?"
2095,"Well WSJ, includes LAC's, so GWU's actual rank among nat unis is 48, Forbes has it around the same, and it beats out it's ""peers"" to overperform if that makes sense."
2096,Boilermakers lol
2097,Forbes is the clear outlier here.
2098,I was recently told that Arizona State University has a wonderful online program 
2099,"Make sure the school is regionally (not nationally) accredited. It should say on the website, but if you're not sure, call an admissions rep and just ask them outright. Usually there will be a community college in your area that offers most of its classes online - start there. It will be much cheaper than a for-profit like Devry and the like."
2100,A lot of regular colleges offer online programs. If you find the right school you might even be able to do the first year online and then change to on-campus without changing schools.
2101,Stay away from DeVry (unless someone else is paying the bill) and University of Phoenix.  Way over priced.  Look into Western Governers Univeristy (WGU) and SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University)-they have wonderful online degree options.  Ohio state and Temple University also have some great online degrees/classes.  Far more legit than DeVry.
2102,I am curious does OSU list on the degree if its online. Usually they do this by listing a campus or something that does not physically exist.
2103,"Also look into University Maryland University College (UMUC). While it may not have the best reputation, it is still better than a for profit. "
2104,Was wanting to go into business management or something stem related. 
2105,There are many more liberal arts and biz degrees online than stem. Only a hand full of universities offer stem online with the correct accreditation. For engineers the program needs I believe its called ABIET credited or maybe its ABET. Can't remember but without this its trash.
2106,"100% agree. There are many online business degrees offered by all sorts of schools. Donny is correct, it's hard to find online STEM programs ABET accredited. "
2107,"Depends on the institution. Have you taken the SAT or ACT? You may need to take these exams. However, these exams are given all over the country and you can just go to the testing location closest to you. Seriously, you shouldn’t consider a school that has no admissions requirements (and even DeVry requires SAT/ACT scores). "
2108,There are tons of State Universities that offer almost all online courses or 100% online to complete a degree. The one thing you need to be careful of is that although it will not say on your degree you were an online student it will sometimes list a campus or college that has no physical presence. That is how an employer will be able to tell you did online.  That being said there are colleges where they will simply list the college campus or college on the degree that has a physical presence. With those no one can tell you are online only. I just say this if this is something you care about because online does have a stigma about it.  Here are some colleges I can think off the top of my head that are legit state online colleges that have a physical location and are well known.  Colorado State University Missouri State Online Penn State Online  Arizona State  Thomas Edison University  Those are just off the top of my head. One thing to remember is that some universities do not advertise being online only but you can usually get 90% of your degree online. For example I know a university that requires you to take 12 credits in person and you can take the rest online. 
2109,UMUC is good and regionally accredited. Made for the military post ww2 and is the biggest online college today
2110,ASU
2111,"As someone who used to work for two For Profit online education companies, I would encourage you to go with the distance learning branch of a traditional Non-Profit university.  The For Profits are just out for a buck and often you leave ill-equipped for an actual career.  This is especially true in fields that require licensure, such as teaching or Psychology.  Also, if the hiring manager has had a bad experience with someone from that online school, exactly because they are ill-equipped, they're going to judge everyone else from that school with the same lens. This can be true of Brick and Mortar institutions as well, but usually then there are enough people from that particular school in an area to even out the reputation a bit.  But I'd definitely recommend staying away from For Profit education if at all possible."
2112,"I can second this.  I have a friend who is a chem major.  Completely slacks off.  She's shown up drunk to class before, gotten drunk DURING class, and refuses to study over extended periods of time.  Since we go to a co-op school, she was preparing to apply that upcoming semester.  She couldn't remember anything of basic gen chem, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry (she had just taken it that past semester!), and physical chemistry...the course she was halfway through THAT semester.  Needless to say, she didn't get a co-op.  She has a mediocre GPA and doesn't remember anything from her classes.  She'll graduate and be able to put down that she received a chemistry degree from a good university, but that doesn't mean she'll actually be of use to companies. "
2113,"Hey, that's how some of us get past Cal II."
2114,Majored in Minority Studies 
2115,"I don't have an online degree, but I did take 13 courses from a distance ed university (AthabascaU in Canada), mostly for medical school pre-requisites.   Pros: very flexible, if you are really motivated, you can get through the coursework much faster than at a brick-and-mortar school. I finished a German course in 10 days. It allowed me to work 20-30 hours a week with a lot less stress - not commuting and parking like 1.5 miles from the lecture hall several times a week saves you a lot of time and energy.   Cons: if you don't have your shit together, you will fail HARD because no one's holding your hand. At a lab session, I met someone who wanted to go to vet school and was taking a few courses to meet her pre-reqs. She was late with every single assignment for no reason - she told me she had done them all, but just didn't submit them. She then didn't submit the lab reports within the one-month deadline and failed the course. She tried to appeal, but the university basically told her she knew full well what the expectations were.  Edit: another big con is social isolation"
2116,"First off, there are 3 types of online degree programs:  1) For profit, DeVry, University of Phoenix, Art Institute of Yo Mamma, etc.  Not sure if your school falls into one?  See the words: ""For-Profit"" and ""Nationally Accredited"".  Nationally Accreditation is the same accreditation used for all schools that advertise on Judge Judy.   The only times these are useful is when you are in a dumb organization that needs a check mark in the degree column for you to move ahead.  Think government mainly.    2) Online, respectable universities.  These are universities that are solely online or distance, but are respected.  Western University's and University of Maryland University College (UMUC) are the only two that come to mind.   These are respected, but the rich alumni base and career centers are not available.  3) Online portions of brick and mortar universities.  Many schools are using this.  Colorado State, a bunch of Cal-States.  Most of them offer the same degree as on-site. These are respected as well, some as much as the real university, some not so much (think Harvard Extension School).  And there are a bunch of extension and certificate programs that are pure money-making schemes for real universities.  If your workplace will pay for it, consider it free training.  But the certificates, unless highly technical or geared towards a specific skillset, are laughable if you put them on a resume.    These programs are great for nontraditional students who may be mid-career or training for a specific job (e.g. teaching).  These are not good for students who have no skills and just want a degree and think jobs will flock towards them.  And, with the exception of the for profit scams like DeVry - what you put in correlates to what you get out.  You can enroll and put in no effort and pay someone from India to do all the coursework, and you will get a useless degree that furthers nothing.    "
2117,"Most universities are nationally accredited. Which doesn't really mean much. It's REGIONAL accreditation you want to look for. It means much more than national accreditation, and also means most (undergrad) credits will transfer. Credits from specialty schools - such as Full Sail - won't transfer into another school's bachelor degree programs. That means if you spend $80k+ on their recording or film program, you end up having to do all your general classes over if you want a career change later on. "
2118,"I agree with this as well. I'm currently a full-time student through Arizona State's online program. While I know it's not the most prestigious, it's definitely credible.   Online was the only format that would work out for me. The closest university to me doesn't offer night classes, plus I do so much better with an online format. "
2119,"Ned Flanders describes it best:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHtj_8ZcmGY  But seriously, ASU is a credible university."
2120,">But seriously, ASU is a credible university.  Not so fast my friend.  ^^^^Beardown"
2121,BEARDOWN
2122,This is good news to me. I just started ASU for a BAS & so far the workload for online classes has been somewhat heavy. I didn't want to invest so much and have it bite me in the ass later if the school wasn't credible. 
2123,"UCLA has their ""Empowered"" program where you can receive certificates and they are a credible university.   EDIT:Certificates, not Degrees"
2124,What's IU?  What are the three masters in?  I'm just curious.  I wish I had three masters
2125,"Indiana University, mentioned upthread."
2126,"Indiana University. Masters from them was in Public Affairs in the early 2000s, others were in engineering in the late 70s from, obviously, more traditional programs. I wish I had three Masters as well, or at least that mine was in something useful."
2127,"Hiring manager here. If I see U of Pheonix or any of that type, I treat it like no degree. Doesn't mean I think less of you, but I don't think much of your degree. "
2128,"And you are qualified to make that determination how?  No offense, but some folks have no other choice but to go online.  Dismissing their resume out of hand because of where they got their degree seems a bit uppity.   For instance, I worked two jobs supporting a family while going to school online.  What I learned there was as academically challenging as any B&M school would offer, if not more.  I got a degree in business, Project Management, and was able to pass the PMI CAPM and PMP tests on the first try within the following few months.  I also kick ass at my job.    Biggest difference between B&M and Online?  My son is going to school now.  He touts the ""Social experience"" and ""Collaborative environment"". What?  Binge Drinking at Frat Parties?  I'm 50 years old, own five houses and served 22 years in the Army.  Earned 5.2 Million dollars for my company as a contractor, and the fucking HR filters wouldn't get me to an interview until I had a BS degree.    Just about pisses me off when someone says that going to a Brick and Mortar school while being a twenty something single kid with parents and financial aid paying the bills is harder or somehow more  challenging than keeping a roof over a family, working 60 hours or more a week to replace the 100K job you lost, being a father and a husband, and having to properly research and cite every thing you write, meet weekly objectives, papers, projects, postings, all properly researched and cited.   "
2129,"Ok, but why didn't you go to an online program from a good school?  There are plenty of options.  "
2130,Exactly...U Phoenix is a bullshit school.... doing an online program and any reputable uni would be fine.. but Phoenix man.. come on 
2131,"Who says I didn't?  I never specified my School.  (Columbia Southern University, FWIW)   My point is, I'm good at what I do- but your company would never have the opportunity to know that because you'd have tossed my resume in the trash, because you ""Don't trust the degree"".    Like I pointed out to the smart ass HR kid that I had to interview with along the process of getting the job I have now- he graduated from UCLA.  Mom and Dad paid for it.  He didn't have a job through college except for internships.  He didn't have a mortgage, a kid going through school that HE had to pay for, two other kids in middle and high school, bills to pay, and two soul crushing jobs, a family to hold together, four rental houses to maintain, He didn't have to do anything but make it to class, turn in roughly the same amount of work I did, if not less.  And I am not complaining...I just had all the responsibilities that grown folks do, and people who counted on me.    Now who's better at managing time, allocating resources, prioritizing tasks, not to mention leading others?  At least, who's *demonstrated* that?   "
2132,"Actually that depends. Some colleges, such as embry riddle, offer degrees online but their diploma and transcripts say worldwide campus distance Ed "
2133,"I have a bachelor's from University of Phoenix.  I think it all depends on the field you are going in to.  For me, the degree made my resume look good enough to get an interview so I could prove that I was a good fit for the company.  I was hired as a systems administrator by a company I love.  The only problem with my education is that I am now under a mountain of debt.  "
2134,I got a BS in IT from U of P also. Currently working as a programmer. It helped me get my foot in the door for sure.
2135,"If you're going to an online school, shouldn't the expenses be less?"
2136,"I think, at UOP, the understanding is that you are essentially purchasing an easy degree.  It really was very little work, unfortunately.  You can learn more in two weeks on www.codeacademy.com then I learned in my classes."
2137,I took a course online through a local college while working full time. I didn't end up completing the course for other reasons but I had a great experience. I was able to contact instructors at any time and could study and complete my work when I saw fit. All of the course material was provided and we had regular chat room sessions with instructors and other students in the same program to make sure we were all on the same page. If you're someone who can keep yourself on task and get yourself to complete assignments on your own then an online course might work for you. However if you need a classroom environment and an instructor lecturing to you and keeping you on task then I don't recommend it. 
2138,Take online classes at an accredited college.  Don't do only online college.   
2139,catnip: not even once.
2140,"I took online classes from an online college- I went 3 years (work was reimbursing me at 100% for that college) and transferred so my degree was from an accredited university, of which I took the classes online. Loop hole!"
2141,"Yeah it is called Mickey mouse college and it's soley because you don't have to do any ""real"" research.  When I was working for my under grad I put in at least 300 hrs into research and the student's who didn't give a shit put in at least 100 hrs into research...  The whole idea of research is to train you how to think rather than to follow in the foot steps of others and hopefully that's what corporations want.  "
2142,Western Governors University 
2143,What in the fuck? An online law degree? Can you even take the bar with that? 
2144,I didn't even know online law schools existed. That's why I asked. 
2145,"I got my master's degree in Library and Information Science from the University of Illinois. I took mostly online courses because I registered for classes late and they were my only option.  This turned out to be advantageous because the classes were 2 hours instead of 3 like the on-campus classes. The online classes met on campus one day each semester to account for shorter class time.   A lot if schools are offering online classes that are just as valid as if you attended on-campus. Makes it easy when you have a job in addition to school.   In terms of finding a job with my degree: one month after I finished my degree, I found a high level job as Associate Director and Head of Reference at a library in the area I wanted to live.   I'm so glad I got my degrees, even if I don't use them directly in my current career. I gained a lot of skills that I wouldn't have had the opportunities or encountered the scenarios to learn otherwise.   Tldr: I got a masters and I'm quite glad that I did. "
2146,"I received a degree from The University of Maryland University College online a couple years back, I do not attribute my high pay to the degree, but it is a decent accomplishment. In the eyes of employers, it is that you finished what you started. The degree is in Cybersecurity, coupled with many industry certifications, I make close to 100k in the states, and over 200k overseas contracting. Mind you I am only 26. It is what you make of it. Depends on how far you want to go within your career, and why you are picking an online program. My advice, if you can, go traditional PT. If you are unable, kids, jobs, remote location, then online is a fine runner up.  With all that being said, most of the comments are correct about online for-profit vs. non-profit. Schools like UMUC, are part of the State of Maryland University system, most people won't bat an eye if you but University of Maryland-UC on your resume, there is also College Park, Baltimore and a couple other schools in that system. But places like Phoenix and Virginia College, which or private-for-profit institutions, I would stay away from."
2147,"UMUC is thankfully part of the UM system, so I've never heard any employer/person doubt its rigor. Many of its graduate programs seem to be tailor made for people connected to the DoD/IC community.  Still think UMUC is a hilarious name."
2148,"The Open University in the UK is known for long-distance/online learning. I know some nice people who teach there, and people with degrees from there can make it on to do good things. However, I don't think it's 'for profit' like some online courses. If anyone is interested in online learning you should check it out."
2149,I have an interview with Best Western as a desk guy
2150,"I have an online degree from a non-online school. No schools in my state offered a Masters in the program I wanted to attend, so I applied to a bunch of random schools. I was accepted into one of the big programs, basically if you have an interest in historic preservation, this is where you go. Unfortunately, tuition was way outside my grasp, but the online program was a lot more affordable.  I ended up finishing my program while working for a historic preservation group. When I started applying for jobs, I got a lot of wtf comments from employers because I had to explain that I worked full-time and finished my program at the same time. Hell, I took a full course load, worked 40 hours a week, and worked on my thesis all at the same time.  Did it work out for me? Not really. I ended up falling into freelance work. I write for some companies online, published a book completely unrelated to my field, and haven't worked in historic preservation in around four years or so. I still love the field, but I got screwed my a former ""supervisor"" who I tried and later threw me under the bus. The school itself talked up the program and kept mentioning how its grad professors were almost all former grads of the program. Turns out that they almost never have any open positions, so I couldn't apply for work there. Most grad schools have a small number of teachers and jobs as professors almost never turn up. I loved the program and still love historic preservation, but my life definitely didn't turn out the way I intended."
2151,"I got a degree in Film; against the advice of most friends and family. After a year and a half of food service jobs I've been working in the film/TV industry for over 2 years now. Both casting for several notable TV series and movies (Warner Bros, HBO, NBC, CW) and working hands on on-set for several feature films and TV shows (Dark Knight Rises, Walter Mitty, Law and Order SVU, Girls, Amazing Spider-Man 2, etc)   My only main issue is that I'm already jaded by the way the industry works as a whole. And it may be too late to find another industry to work in (would love to work in Video Games). "
2152,My wife is currently making $89k a year with her online degree.
2153,Kaplan University
2154,"I don't think they trash it if it's from a traditional, accredited university with an online program. The ones most people are talking about here are for-profit online schools, like the University of Phoenix."
2155,"Kaplan at least has regional accreditation, unlike U of Phoenix, which is nationally accredited. National accreditation is generally reserved for for-profit schools, and don't hold much weight. Regional accreditation holds significantly more value."
2156,"Capella is also a for-profit school but has regional accreditation (and many of their programs are accredited by the institutions that offer licensure like CACREP for counselors, etc.)."
2157,"Uhhh, not true at all. In banking, it's experience and proven track record in numbers that gets you a job.   I've been in banking for years."
2158,MBA is worthless unless it's from a brand name school and/or backed by years of experience.
2159,I got my law degree from some shady online college. I got fired and now I go to a community college with some loveable misfits.
2160,"Online certification (e.g. project management or SPSS) or online coursework from a reputable institution is much different from an online degree from a diploma mill. If I see Walden, Phoenix, Capella, or any of their ilk, the resume goes in the trash. In my field, the degrees from these places aren't even properly accredited, and I've witnessed coworkers who can't string together a paragraph getting master's degrees and PhDs."
2161,"I have to agree.  I'm in Capella's Mental Health Counseling program, which is CACREP accredited as well and it takes quite a bit more time and effort than most of my psychology classes did when I was an undergraduate at a reputable private school.  As an undergrad I probably ended up with good grades just because I showed up to class, was respectful, and at least tried to do my work.  And office hours.  As an online student I can't kiss ass quite like that.  So it's all hard work."
2162,"I stand corrected re: the accreditation. It's hard to get over multiple bad personal experiences with any institution, though, and the fact that folks like my coworker were able to graduate doesn't speak well for the program, I'm afraid. Some of the cover letters I've received from graduates of Capella and Walden have been riddled with typos, run-on sentences, and so on.   Sorry if I sound like an elitist asshole, but I'm just relaying my experience as a hiring manager. Clearly, there are some talented and intelligent folks attending these programs, so I'll do my best to be more open-minded next time there's an open position on my team."
2163,"I'm studying nursing via distance ed, and its really good. In all honesty I am really slack with the studying as I have a toddler and am two months pregnant, so seem to leave assignments to the last minute, but I have still been achieving high marks so apparently I am understanding the course work.   Because my university offers it both on campus and off campus I doubt it will affect my job prospects at all when I'm finished, as its exactly the same degree.   And for those wondering it is a Bachelor of nursing to become an RN, not an EN course "
2164,"My wife got both her BSN and MSN online.  She had no problems getting a job as a Nurse, or a Nurse educator.   Go get 'em.   "
2165,"My best friend has an online Bachelor's in Graphic Arts. He now works as a technical writer. He seems happy with his current gig, but I attribute it more to his strong work ethic and not necessarily his degree."
2166,"I started out at a brick and mortar university but was unable to afford it. Tried going to a community college and they screwed up my financial aid three times in a row. The next thing on the list was online school; I'm working on an Associates in Counter-Terrorism Studies with American Public University. So far so good; I like my classes, professors, etc.  To note other for-profit schools, my dad has a degree from University of Phoenix and (I think) Kaplan University. He's an HR ""professional"" as he likes to say, and he's done just fine."
2167,"I see no mention of Western Governors University here. Has anyone gone that route? I've had several friends go into programs (all IT) and have great success with it, but I haven't heard reddit's experiences with it. "
2168,"Phoenix. I work in software, there are plenty of self-educated people in software who point to cool things they have built when someone doubts their education. I would say 80% of what I know I learned independently. The school work was very easy - if you ever got tutored in a subject to get ahead (as opposed to catch up) you know what I mean - when you're far enough ahead every thing you write/type is as easy and natural as name and date.  I really enjoyed this arrangement, I read a lot of great books on the topics of my classes and played around with every language and tool we were using, and more. I also worked, a lot, to support myself and to pay for school. I didn't end up building anything cool enough to be proud of on my resume while in school, but my internship (not school-related) turned into my first real job at a very cool company after I finished school. In effect all I got from school was a shove into some aspects of my field that I thought were lame and boring (some things take a few years to grow on you, like your parents and writing documentation) and a piece of paper that doubled my hours, my pay, and gave me benefits.  I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANY FIELD BESIDES SOFTWARE  I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANYONE BESIDES THE SELF-MOTIVATED  If you're not all of the above, forget my happy outcome and read some other responses.  *EDIT:* I really have to re-state, in CompSci you can learn and practice everything with a computer and an internet connection. I can't think of another field where this applies. I wanted to finish college because:  1. Sitting down and learning a subject without a guide is hard.  2. I didn't really believe I could get hired as a self-taught person.  If you are in the same situation as me, I would advise:  1. Take free CS courses from MIT, Harvard, and all the other amazing universities that offer them. One of them actually offers a degree (with lots of asterisks) now.  2. Find people who want to collaborate on cool things. Small cool things. Things you think you could finish in a 20-hour day. (You will learn a hard truth that you've always thought didn't apply to you.)"

2171,"Like others have said, go with a brick and mortar institution that offers online degrees.  So many schools do this now.  I'm enrolled at Champlain College for MS in Infosec.     I originally started at Capella and switched after the first class to the traditional school.  I literally Google'd something like  ""top online masters programs"" and weeded out any school that wasn't brick and mortar, then researched the pros and cons from there.    "
2172,"WGU.   Western Governor's University.  About 5000 a year - you can take as many classes as you want, just have to complete 12 units each 6 month. AWESOME one on one support by a dedicated mentor. All the materials are provided, including things like CBTnuggets, Boson test preps, lab simulators, etc. The books are electronic so I did buy a handful of books - especially for the Cisco.  I have gotten two promotions and tripled my salary since I started. Best thing I ever did.  I have a B.S. in IT with security emphasis. The finals for ALL of the IT classes are passing the certifications which are including in the tuition. I got credit for my existing A+, Security + and my AA in Networking from the local Tech College, so started as a Junior. (at age 52) Walked away with a CCNA, CCNA Security, CompTIA Project +  and LPIC-1 / Linux + 2015   NSA CNSS 4011  The CIW certs aren't worth a lot but I learned a lot with them:   CIW Web Design Specialist CIW Javascript Specialist CIW Database Specialist "
2173,"+1 for WGU.. got my BS in IT from them few years back. Good mix of traditional education and industry certs. I've been mulling over going back for masters, but kids are in college or starting soon. Good alumni connections too!"

2175,I simply googled online bs management information systems
2176,"Here's what I did. I've had a pretty successful career but not having a degree really bugged me. After a lot of trial and error. I went back to school at 26 (now 31 and finally close to graduation) and I highly recommend the following path:  - Enroll at you local Community College first. Most community colleges offer almost completely online programs today. The advantage of a community college is that you have an actual brick and mortar school to drive to to meet with tutors and professors, while still doing almost all your classes online. This also give you the option of taking more difficult/interesting classes in person. If you worried about your age you'll learn CC varies from 18-65. Also this will save you a ton of money. Not to mention in some cases an AA degree from a CC might be worth more than a for profit online degree.   - After enrolling at the local community college look at your states online college program. For instance in my area we have UMUC (University of Maryland) and Penn State Online. Most state college systems offer an online program linked to your actual school system. This makes transferring credits seamless. I would dual enroll in CC and your states online almost right away. Most will have a transition program so not a single credit is wasted and you'll earn a AA after your second year. Even though UMUC for example blitzs our market with ads at least I know its not for profit like UoP.  - It sounds like your career is setup well, but most IT programs have classes based on certifications. I would recommend taking the cert after the class. For example a typical ""network security"" class will link directly to Security+ cert.  - Suck it up and realize it will take 4-6 years even online, but we live in a golden age online education and you'll find a vast amount offered from free sources to help out.   Good Luck!"
2177,I'm an instructor at a CC and I agree with this. CC's now have many online programs and its an accredited degree that will allow you to enroll in a state university.  You really do have to watch out for the ITT tech's Phoenix and other non-accredited diploma mills. 
2178,"There may be cheaper options (if you're not a PA resident).  Western Governor's is an accredited online-only college, so the pacing, flexibility, and tuition can all be better for someone with a job and a family.  http://www.wgu.edu/online_it_degrees/programs  I haven't enrolled at WGU (I applied and got auto-rejected for not having a HS diploma even though I have a Master's), but I studied out various options fairly thoroughly a few years ago, and it is definitely worth looking at.  I did my Master's online through GATech, which was fine but really nothing more than video-taped classroom lectures, so I couldn't fully recommend it.  Programs that focus on online education are going to have better resources and support for you."
2179,"WGU is amazing if you're looking at IT, you get a ton of certifications as you go through the program- I admit I am biased because I work there, but OP's situation sounds exactly like most of the students I get- if you want more information you can PM me. "
2180,"Consider Excelsior College, regionally accredited and nonprofit: http://www.excelsior.edu/programs/technology"
2181,"I went to a community college then a university to end up getting a bachelors and masters in Spanish, which you pretty much can't do online.  I had two friends do online college.  1 went to some unknown online university, spent $$$$$ and graduated and its not taken seriously because nobody recognizes it and its only online so I think some people don't trust them or something.  She has had a terrible time and she's in debt-a lot.   My other friend went to an actual college that has a good online program.  She takes one in person class and the rest she does online.  It's called the PACE program for working adults but its an actual, accredited university here (she could in any semester actually take in person classes if she wants to or if something isn't offered online) and she is almost done and already has a job lined up.   I think the difference is just respect for their effort (because who knows who did the work in the completely online classes) and recognition of the school.  Also, my friend at the actual university ended up spending less!   Good for you for going back-just be smart about it! And definitely look into pell grants! And don't go to any school that isn't accredited.    My ex boyfriends mother went to one of those 12 month nursing school things and it wasn't accredited so the only places that will hire her are the companies that work with that school...and she can't use the year if she decided to actually become a nurse, which she won't but it wouldn't even be an option to transfer.    Good luck!!"
2182,"I did Designlab’s UX design course, with an art history BA under my belt, and went from making 40k in a career with a low ceiling to 70k with a high ceiling for salary. Took me 1 year from beginning to getting hired. "
2183,Did you do the UX academy? The USD 5999 one? Can you please share your experience doing the course? I am really interested!Thanks :)))
2184,"Yes that’s the one!  I had a very positive experience, and I absolutely recommend the course. I was skeptical because it’s less recognized than General Assembly or some of the others. Also, there seems to be mixed perspectives as far as how valuable and worthwhile these courses are. You’ll see plenty of UX professionals on Reddit saying how they never hire people from these courses, etc. So naturally I was concerned, but took those statements with a grain of salt and pursued it anyways.  I think my experience was so positive because of my mentor. He was super communicative, encouraging, and empathetic, not to mention incredibly intelligent and successful.   At the end of the course, I had completed an online portfolio and had gained the language to speak confidently about user experience design. Took me a couple months to land a job, but immediately landed a job after going through a staffing agency.   Overall, completing the course through designlab truly set my life on the path I had wanted for so long. I’m now in an industry that challenges me, and every day I feel so fortunate to have had the fortitude to pursue what I wanted and to have actually landed a job. That being said, I am super passionate about understanding people on a very human level, problem solving, and working with others. I love giving people positive experiences, so the industry very much matches my personality. Definitely do your research before committing to one of these programs because once you commit, you really have to be prepared to work your ass off, even after the course ends. Interviews for these jobs are no joke.   Can I ask, why do you wish to pursue one of these programs? What is driving you to want to enter this field? "
2185,"Thank you so much for your detailed reply. For me the reason I have been looking into UX courses (I actually considered GA but it’s outrageous how much that costs) is because since a very young age (I am 30 now) I am always looking at websites or even just everyday products and think how to improve them and make them more user friendly. I do that even with the documents I draft (I am now a paralegal). So when I came to know about UX I was like ohhhh sweet that sounds like something I would like. I do calligraphy and so I also pay a lot of attention to type face, color combinations and illustration on app interfaces, website or even just greeting cards haha. So yeah... haha I am so encouraged reading about your experience!! Very happy for you too!!"
2186,"Second this, I'm considering doing Springboards UX course for ~the same cost. I'm just leery about this paid online courses that *seem like schools* but are really just businesses offering an online product.  ^ the key difference for me would be the applicable workforce skills and one-on-one mentorship support/structure other online courses don't offer.    **Whats your experience been?"
2187,"I will say that with Designlab, the workforce skills you’re talking about were highly stressed. No lesson was presented without considering the functionality within an actual workplace. My mentor was constantly training me on how to answer stakeholder questions, etc.   See my reply to the above comment for more details about my experience. Or feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions! "
2188,"No problem. It's delivery, not Digiorno."
2189,"I'm sooo going to use that. Thanks for the laugh.   A while back I read someone calling weed, the devils lettuce. I started to use that phrase irl and now people are picking it up. lmao"
2190,Haha no problem. Glad my humor is appreciated. I used to sarcastically refer to it as the devils lettuce when I was in highschool :)

2196,There’s a Shopify sponsored degree program -Devs Degree. You learn on the job for 4 years and get a degree from a Canadian university. This is an all expenses paid program where you learn from mentors at Shopify. 
2197,"Western Governors University is about $3500 per 6 month term, completely online, non-profit, and competency based. If you have previous education your credits may transfer, and if you’re already competent in a subject you can pass a class in a day. They have both business and tech degrees."
2198,"That is correct. Check out the WGU sub if you haven’t already. I’m doing my MBA through them, and highly recommend it. "
2199,"I think it is worth it. I did my undergrad at a standard university that cost a ton of money. Even there I didn’t have really any networking opportunity, because I was locked out of those career growth things because of a low GPA. I’ve been in the work force for over 15 years, and wanted to get a grad degree in a better paying field, but I just wasn’t willing to pay the insane tuition costs, work on anyone else’s schedule, and sit through traditional classes. I work full time, commute 10 hours a week, and have a disability. Traditional education was not an option. A close friend recommended WGU, and I chose it as best for my needs. It isn’t easy, you have to be self-motivated, manage your time well, test well, write well to pass the classes. At the same time, they tell you exactly what they are looking for to prove competency on essays. They take out the bullshit of course work. I don’t think much about the networking stuff. I know there are groups that meet online within degree programs and within classes, you’re assigned a mentor, and there are course instructors. I believe they can help you network around. That said there are many ways to network, friends, family, colleagues, former employers, volunteer supervisors, meet up groups, church functions, LinkedIn, etc. My friend who recommended WGU to me never had a problem getting interviews or jobs with her degree, and I don’t expect to have an issue either. WGU now has several satellite affiliates and they are growing, companies offer tuition reimbursement for their programs, and they take industry standards seriously when determining competency. I understand your nervousness, I was also, and then I decided I just needed to do it so I could get a better paying job. It was the only real option for me. I can’t say that all is well yet because I haven’t graduated, but I fully expect to double my income once I graduate. "
2200,"All schools have some really bad reviews, but even on niche.com it has 4.5 out of 5 stars with over 2,700 reviews. I’m a year in and have no problems with any of it, and prefer the method of education that WGU offers. But I’m also in my 30s, have significant work experience, and don’t need hand holding. My undergrad big 10 public ivy university actually has a lower average score according to that website. For whatever it’s worth Harvard, Stanford, and Yale also have lower star ratings than WGU."
2201,"I'm going through UC Denver's online MPA program. it'll be around 26k for the whole program.  whatever you do, look for national accreditation of whatever you're looking for, then compare that to program rankings, and most importantly job projections via the bls "
2202,Harvard extension school Masters of Liberal Arts in Finance  extension.harvard.edu  You can complete the degree with their financial aid package for about 12k which isn’t bad for an Ivy League masters. Take a look on the website and see if any of their programs match what your needs are!  Edit: they also do undergrad degrees. I think the cost of the ALB is about 25-30k.
2203,"I’m doing the ALM in management and completed an internship at a fortune 50 pharma company and interviewing for another position today.  Like anything else don’t expect the program itself to allow you to waltz into a role, but in my experience people respect the name, find it interesting and are open to networking.  Also career services has been a good tool for me! Linda is amazing and helped me navigate my experience effectively and make friends! I highly recommend it :)"
2204,You can also take a look in Europe or Poland in particular. It has interesting and not so expensive Master Programs in english. Plus living there is very comfortable and cheap :)  Good luck!

2207,"I got a marketing degree from Grand Canyon University and I have a great job. I might be one of the lucky ones though, I'm unsure.  Wouldn't say its inexpensive, but it wasn't terrible since I got my Associatea degree from a community college first."
2208,"Georgia Tech's Online Masters of CS or Analytics are both great. About 10k in total, which is a really cheap investment considering what you get out of it. No GRE required."
2209,"I was going to say the [BS in software engineering](https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/penn-state-online-software-engineering-bachelors-degree/overview) from Penn State World Campus, but that's expensive. And there's an online master's in computer science from Georgia that's a good deal, but that's a masters... Maybe the computer science bachelor's from [UMUC](https://www.umuc.edu/academic-programs/bachelors-degrees/computer-science-major.cfm).  Have you considered the Lambda School? It sounds interesting but I don't know a whole lot about it. In general I recommend online programs from major universities, but there are a lot of intriguing offerings out there especially at the certificate level."
2210,Do you consider UMUC a good school?
2211,Georgia Tech has an online MS in Computer Science for about $7k. https://www.omscs.gatech.edu

2213,"A community college will almost certainly be cheaper. To defer your federal loans you typically need to maintain full-time student status, so generally 12+ credits each semester. It looks to me like Kansas in-state tuition for CC students is about $75/credit...which is really very low compared to many other states. I don't think you'll find an online ""college"" that is any cheaper than that."
2214,[University of the People](http://www.uopeople.org/) if you're looking for a Comp Sci or Business Admin degree. All online and pretty much free.
2215,"Great question. As University of the People is pretty much free, I have no idea how that works. You shouldn't need to take any loans to get a degree there. But no idea if it would work to defer any existing loans."
2216,"My advice-look into Penn Foster and Ashworth college.  Both are accreted, real, legit online schools.  Note-they DO NOT accept federal aid, student loans or FASFA.  Why?  Because they are pay as you go.  They are the only schools that offer low monthly payments (or you can pay all at once per semester) and they do accept nearly all transfer credits. They are 100% online distance learning.  In fact they won't release your grades/allow you to enroll in the next semester until the current one is paid off.  Both colleges run about $1200-1300 for 5 courses/15 credits (3 credits each) and offer AA, BA and a couple masters degree options.  Both offer tutoring, online assistance and availability to instructors and fellow students to ask any/all questions you need to complete the lessons.  Cost is the same per student, regardless of where the live in the states  http://www.ashworthcollege.edu/  http://www.pennfoster.edu/"

2218,Undergrad like from Phoenix? Prob same level as an associates degree. 
2219,"As an employer and someone who is working on an online masters degree, I have a new appreciation of online degrees. I don't know about comparing it to a standard degree, but if I were to interview a candidate with an online degree I would at least ask them about the experience and not discount them for receiving an online degree."
2220,"Not a hiring person, but generally if it's from an accredited program, it's the same as any other degree. You don't have to explain where you got it unless it's from a very recognizable ""diploma mill"" institution like University of Phoenix.   I'm completing my bachelor's online through a local college. I chose it specifically because it's an actual brick-and-mortar institution that I can physically go to if I have an issue, which means a flesh-and-blood teacher and staff that I can talk to. Granted, I haven't been there physically in over two years -I'm what you'd call a turtle-paced undergrad, only taking 6 credits at a time. It's all I can afford, and all I can take mentally with working a full-time job. But hey, end result is going to be the same either way.   I'm looking at doing my master's degree through John Hopkins University, and their program is online as well. When I get my M.A. it won't read ""JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY - FAKE-ASS PUSSY DIVISION"", it'll just say the name of the school. I'll still be doing real-life internships as well as a two-week onsite seminar to get hands-on experience, and I'll be volunteering a lot as well. "
2221,"most community colleges and pretty much all the major universities ranging from AU, UNLV, UCLA, SD State, SRJC, etc etc etc have great online programs and you can visit the teachers who run the online classes.   I know a lot of business owners and dine with them and attend their conferences and what not. Also knowing a handful of proffsionals a lot of them expressed how they absolutely loath for profit schools like ITT tech, Devry (lol), Lincoln College, University of Pheonix, Kaplen college and how they'd never ever hire anybody who attended these schools.   You have to be one dumb mother fucker to attend these schools.   For me, personally when I call in a tech for issues with my computers I make sure it isn't someone with ITT Tech on their resume.   Somebody on reddit went so far as to leak manuals and books and stuff from the school and my head fucking exploded twice."
2222,"If it's a degree from a normal, accredited university that offers online courses, then it's the same as any other degree. If it's from a for-profit diploma mill like DeVry or ITT Tech or University of Phoenix, then it's worse than nothing."
2223,Southern New Hampshire University is a not for profit school that offers quite a few undergrad and masters programs completely online.
2224,"I've supervised uniformed personnel for a long time and seen the rise of online programs. Be really careful about online degrees and degree programs. Your best bet is to find a real school, with real grass, and a college football program (bear with me), and then check out their online programs.   About the college football program: a school that has one has an established grass-brick physical presence. And that's worth $ compared to one run out of a strip mall in Miami. Imagine if you're competing with someone and you have exactly the same skills, but your degree comes from a physically-established program as compared to a pure online school. You'll win the interview. Look at Park U if you need to go online (I'm not affiliated with them in any way) as an example."
2225,"Grand Canyon University is a for-profit school in the same vein as DeVry, Ashford, AMU, or University of Phoenix.  As others here pointed out, they just aren’t held to the same esteem as most regionally accredited schools. ~~In fact, I think the DoD even banned AMU from being eligible for TA for a while, because they were seen as predatory and offering an inferior education. (I think Betsy DeVos is trying to undo this, but I may be wrong.)~~ (proved wrong by /u/colabear19)  I was doing some research for military friendly schools myself a bit back - here’s a few I found to be reputable, most of which are tied to state brick-and-mortar universities.  ~~- University of Maryland University College (I know, stupid name)~~ I should do more research. University of Maryland College Park has a stellar reputation, not necessarily University College, apparently  - Arizona State University (great for technical degrees! I worked with a lot of engineers in Silicon Valley who got their Computer Science undergraduate and master degrees from here) - Colorado State University (ty, /u/russki !) - Penn State University - Ohio State University - Oregon State University - Utah State University - Excelsior College (I believe they’re a private school, but they’re very accommodating to military folks. I believe a lot of Master Chiefs of the Navy graduated from here.)  Military friendliness is one important aspect, for sure. But a school's reputation is another important aspect. You can try looking through US News' online programs rankings to scrutinize for yourself. (Of course, they're just one of many resources). https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education"
2226,Currently using TA for AMU here.
2227,"If you want your degree to be taken seriously, stay away from online for-profit colleges and even some non-profit.  I’m talking about: UMUC, AMU, SNHU, Grand Canyon University, Trident U, University of Phoenix, and others. "
2228,"Post University is a good one to look into,as well as Southern New Hampshire university. They both have good programs for service members"

2231,University of Louisville online will do Degrees for $250/credit hour as an active duty discounted rate.  That is whether or not you use tuition assistance.  You won't find a better deal.    http://louisville.edu/online/tuition
2232,University of Wisconsin is highly regarded
2233,Both my husband and I are at Southern New Hampshire University. They have quite a few degree programs and a very flexible schedule. They've got many start dates in the year. I do the 4 semesters a year. Classes are 8 weeks long. but they also have standard class times. They've got discounts for military and I believe all of the military academic advisors have served. It is an awesome school. I am using FAFSA and my husband is using TA. They were very accommodating for the TA! Only took my husband about 3 weeks to get everything set up from company to school. 
2234,"Degree plan?  Got to rep my school WGU though. 3k for 6 months, flat rate. Minimum of 12 credits in those six months, but you can bang out more if you want."
2235,"I finished up my degree at WGU this last week. Bachelors of Science, IT-Security. I have degrees from WGU AND a brick and mortar school. I can tell you several things, I learned more at WGU and felt significantly more accomplished at WGU because I didn't have my hand held. I have 10 different IT certifications and now work as a Security Officer. Not only has my degree never been questioned in interviews, it has actually been praised. Many of the smartest IT folks that I've worked with have WGU degrees. In fact that is where I got the idea to even look at WGU originally.      Brick and mortar schools serve a purpose but they simply cannot stack up to the flexibility of WGU (did I mention I've been military for the lat 15 years as well?). You will pay more at a brick and mortar school, the certifications will not be part of your curriculum, and you will have less flexibility. WGU has the same accreditation as the University of Oregon and tons of others. I see users in here mentioning competition between you and another person, but you have a degree from an online school and they have one from a brick and mortar school, then say it is favorable for the non-online school. This is a made up scenario that doesn't happen, which is laughable. Why? Because WGU you do not get your hand held at all, you do all the work yourself. If any interviewer is worth their salt, they will know what goes into the more well-known school programs.       TLDR: There isn't a wrong answer, just that the answer is going to different depending on what is right for you! Many people in here spewing what-if scenarios that don't happen in reality. "
2236,"Attending AMU personally.  They have helped me do things such as work on a resume, got me into an apprenticeship program relating to my degree and took a bunch of elective credits based on being a submariner E5.  If you do any research, then yes some places do not personally like for-profit colleges while others do.  Difference in for-profit is the lack of focus on general education and more on specialized.  I do agree that a non-profit, state college-type-thing that also has an online program generally looks better.  However, AMU and Excelsior are both regionally accredited schools and are further accredited in specific programs by boards that mean something.  The most important part is to do research on that school prior to committing.  For instance, AMU got sued by the state of either Massachusetts or Pennsylvania (I cannot find it currently) for their failure to disclose post-completion employment data.  They did not lose their certification.  While I also agree that  for-profit colleges are a business, either way you are paying for a product.  WGU is another example.  They are regionally accredited  and their online teaching program is also one of the only online accredited ones.  I also know people at the company that I am apprenticing with that got their degrees through AMU as well as connections through sites like LinkedIn.  Online for-profits are generally more flexible with schedules as well.  TL:DR   Do research and haters gonna hate on online college because they paid more or took on loans for their brick-and-mortar degree. A degree is mostly a check in the box and you need networking and experience.  Edit: There are pros and cons to for-profit and non-profit.  Research.  Edit 2: Graduation rates seem to be lower for online for-profit schools as there is less interaction.  If you are good at teaching yourself it may be for you. Results may vary."

I started with notepad++ on WinXP and when sublime text came out in 2008 I've used that every day.  My favorites are:  1. Sublime text 1. Vim 1. VS Code 1. Jetbrains IDE  I use them all equally as they're tools to get a task done.  Sublime for scratch.txt, a fast launch and browsing tons of files.  Vim for editing text and running macros or opening 1 GB text files quickly. Vim > sublime for performance.  I'm writing this in VS Code w/ markdown preview. And for a live preview of LaTeX.  Regular expressions are 100% the same in sublime and VS code (and I think Jetbrains too).  I've made all my 4 editors follow hotkeys from Jetbrains (Intellij, GoLand).   | key      | action           | | -------- | ---------------- | | ctrl + y | delete line      | | ctrl + d | duplicate line   | | ctrl + w | expand selection | | ctrl + 4 | close tab        | | alt + 1  | toggle side bar  |"
2239,"I suggest CLion.  It's commercial software, but I think you can get it for free if you're a student.  It's cross-platform, flexible, has a growing plugin ecosystem, and its code analysis and refactoring features are second-to-none. Using it as an IDE will require some familiarity with the CMake build system, since its project awareness is built on top of it, but that's good to know anyway, and for simple projects it's trivial to set up.   My only real knock on it is that the built-in debugging is just adequate.  IMHO coding in ""dumb"" text editors is for preening hipsters and old dudes whose preferences calcified decades ago, not programmers looking for the best ways to get work done quickly and well in 2019.   Powerful tools make coding much more pleasant."
2240,"I use emacs for everything. I assume there are probably code completion plugins available, but I hate the idea so I've never looked into it.  But after 20 years of using it and trying the hot new editor of the day on a regular basis... Nothing comes close to feeling as right as emacs does out of the box or working as well as it does"
2241,"Ditto.  Emacs is potentially infinitely powerful, running its own domain specific extension language.  Not for the faint hearted, but the nuclear option for those who care to wield such a thing."
2242,"If you want a debugger, use eclipse. If not then I just use sublime or atom"
2243,I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) it should have everything you want.
2244,Sublime text is a text editor not an IDE therefore it does not have a debugger.
2245,I use gedit
2246,"I don't like IDE's because of the bloat that comes with them, but I can see the allure.  The built in debug suite that comes with Visual Studio (last used it like 3 years ago I think) is really really nice.  I work in vim combined with ctags, and I normally mix this with tmux. You can compile and do all that fun stuff in vim on it's own, but I like having tmux at the aid.  I started tmux a while back so that I wouldn't lose ongoing work on machines I had to ssh into, but I've got used to building using in with multipane set ups."
2247,I use visual studio at work and vim at home. I don't think there's a reason to use an IDE for C if you don't work on a bigger project with more than one developer.
2248,ViM
2249,"Notepad++ is perfectly fine.  If you want the features of an IDE, perhaps try Visual Studio."
2250,"For C programming there are two options: 1) Vim: editor not an IDE. It's my choice. Vim has a lot of plugin for autocomplete and for customization. 2) CLion: one of the best IDE that I ever used. It's very easy to use, it is configurated perfectly since the first start. Seeking information about Vim you could discover Emacs, my advice is to avoid emacs because it's very complicated as editor."
2251,>For C programming there are two options  ROFLMAO
2252,"JetBrains IDEs are just so wonderfully good at what they do.  They index the world, are generally context aware and just generally speed up coding."
2253,Doesn't really inspire me enough to switch from VSCommunity to it.
2254,"Have you tried Visual Studio Community? Sure, C support goes as far as the C++ demands, but within that set, IntelliSense works, and it's wonderful."
2255,"Intellisense is pretty good. I find that JetBrains stuff just flows more nicely as I type than visual studio does though.  Command line editor completions used to all be laughable and more often than not just got in your way. I haven’t done much evaluation of them since language server picked up steam, I admit."
2256,"I've used both quite a bit.  MSVC is very good... if you're developing on/for Windows.  This is inherently very subjective, but I think CLion has an edge in user experience and useful code awareness, and it's more broadly useful for more kinds of work.  On the other hand, MSVC's built-in debugging suite is more powerful."
2257,>nothing does for free what JetBrains IDEs do.  emacs will run around JetBrains and spit in its face for free.
2258,"Visual Studio Code (*not* Visual Studio, which is a full IDE) works quite well, with C/C++ plugins. Try it out: https://code.visualstudio.com/  If you don't like telemetry, you can disable it by editing configuration file or just try VSCodium (https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), which is Visual Studio Code without Microsoft branding and with disabled all kinds of telemetry.  Both are free to use."
2259,"Atom is a pretty good editor. I use it a lot and it has some predictive capabilities. Limited, but still there"
2260,"IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. This means it comes with a Editor, usually with code completion, syntax highlighting, formatting, syntax error checking etc... A compiler, usually with tools like Make etc.. And a debugger. All built into the tool."
2261,"Atom? Free, easy to get, less branding then vs code, and pretty bare bones but you can build it up however you need it."
2262,"you should try out the IDE clion. It is free for students. I love it for C++, have little experience with it for C.  [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)"
2263,"you should try out the IDE clion. It is free for students. I love it for C++, have little experience with it for C.  [https://www.jetbrains.com/student/](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)"
2264,"you should try out the IDE clion. It is free for students. I love it for C++, have little experience with it for C."
2265,Visual Studio Code. 
2266,Yeah it's a bit slower than other options like sublime or np++ but its still way faster than a full IDE. It also scales nicely and the text font looks the best to my eyes.   If you're doing a lot of text file based changes then I would just keep it running. 
2267,Electron...
2268,"VSC is *way* faster than Atom and I have no idea how. The only thing I've (personally) seen conclusively beat at loading it is N++, honestly."
2269,"Yep, it is, but not as faster as Sublime yet :("
2270,"This answer also applies to OSX fwiw (haven't tried it on Linux, but maybe there too)"
2271,It is available for Linux too but I also haven't tried it on that platform.
2272,"I use it on Linux, works the exact same as windows/OSX"
2273,"Well...VS Code isn't bad at all, but I still think it has some catching up to Atom.  VS Code's startup time is very slow and comparable to Atom's due to both being a Electron Hybrid Desktop app. However, in my experience at least, Atom has much more powerful extensions that Code ATM thanks to it's bigger community support.  Again, don't get me wrong, VS Code isn't bad, I just feel like it's a more limited atom without the pro of it being more lightweight.  Also, am I the only one that loves having 2 editors at once? Sublime for quick opening files, and Atom for actual projects."
2274,VS COde it is more lightweight. 
2275,"I'd say my top 5 go something like so...  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) * [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) * [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) * [Atom](https://atom.io/) * [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit)  Honourable mentions go to:  * [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) * [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) * [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)  This wasn't always the order (SciTE, Notepad++, Atom, Vim have all been at the top of my list), but for the most part the key benefits are:  * feature-rich * cross-platform (except for Notepad++) * syntax highlighting * autocomplete * ongoing support via developers and communities * Unicode * free (except for Sublime Text, which has never been compelling enough to warrant the cost, though it has also never really been a primary editor for me... despite influencing others in the list)  Fair enough, large files, obscure language support, bloated installs and some slowness on startup, and (in the case of modern command palette editors or Vim) changes in mental model when processing code can change individuals responses to different editors.  So, why is VS Code at the top of my list?  Over the last few years, I went from Vim to Atom to VS Code...  Vim is cool, productive, but large source trees just got irritating (even with NERDTree) and search tools...  Atom (after it got a bit of a speed injection) was pretty great (despite the occasional issues with the Squirrel updater eating CPU), but a language plugin I use for work went downhill, I seemed to encounter more problems with git integration at the filesystem level (than with VS Code), and VS Code just got faster/smoother (and I got used to it, as it improved).  For those wondering what cool things are on my VS Code list, here's a short list:  * theme support is good (and affects the sidebar) - CTRL+K, CTRL+T to switch themes when my eyes start to bug me is nice too * CTRL+ENTER and SHIFT+CTRL+ENTER for opening new lines above/below your current line * CTRL+D (and CTRL+K, CTRL+D) to do multi-selection/multi-cursors (and skip occurrences) is nice - SHIFT+CTRL+L to select all occurrences is pretty groovy too * CTRL+I to select the current line (without a lot of cursor movement) * CTRL+ALT+ARROW for block selection mulit-cursors * CTRL+B to hide/show the sidebar (and SHIFT+CTRL+E to access the file list, then CTRL+1 (or 2, etc.) to move back to your editing window) is nice * CTRL+\ for a split of the current file (and the standard CTRL+F4 to close a split) * bracket matching, with SHIFT+CTRL+\ to jump to the matching bracket saves some time/confusion * CTRL+K, M to change the source mode/syntax highlighting (NOT CTRL+K, CTRL+M which allows keybinding selection) * ALT+Z to toggle word wrap * CTRL+/ for quick commenting * SHIFT+CTRL+F for folder level search with a number of bells and whistles (did I mention folder level editing... also supported easily by Sublime and Atom, and in a similar, but different way, in Komodo Edit) * paste in some JSON, hit SHIFT+ALT+F to format (make sure you've switched your source mode to JSON)  That doesn't even include the Git integration, terminal/shell integration, debugging (which I've never used), numerous plugins (which I go light on anyway), state memory through editing sessions (even on unsaved files)... which I never used to like... Markdown preview, monthly updates, and more I'm sure I'm forgetting.  The good news, is that many of those features (and even keybindings) are the same/similar in Atom or Sublime.  Syntax highlighting can lag a little in VS Code (usually on switching tabs), and startup time could be a bit laggy (though I never really notice, and pretty much always have my instance open), but other than that... It's my editor to beat.  I'd also recommend looking at the editors supported by [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/#integrations), if you're looking for preferred Windows editors. They should support the ones with the most demand (or that made the most sense).  EDIT: personalize my reasons for not paying up on Sublime... It's never been a primary editor *for me*... though it isn't on the outskirts of the industry..."
2276,Second for NotePad++ but also Textpad. I prefer Textpad myself but depends on what you're using it for.
2277,Sublime is the best overall. It's basically anti-fuck up.  Notepad++ is free and you can set it up to work better than sublime. You may also find yourself needing to add some other things (non-official plugins) to make it do stuff it can't do.  Visual Studio is also aaaight.
2278,"Man, this is a loaded question, I personally love VS Code,   but like you I use notepad++ for really quick fixes. But there is also:  [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)  - requires a bit of work to get to near full IDE status. Tell people you code in this and you will get some ""uh-huhs"" and eye brow raises.   [Atom](https://atom.io/)   [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)"
2279,"Props for mentioning Brackets. Still the best ""so you want to throw together a web page(s)"" app I've used"
2280,There are some site generator frameworks that ship with filesystem watch/livereload; I use Middleman and VSCode for my work and it's pretty solid.
2281,"Since I mainly work in PowerShell, I've become a big fan of Visual Studio Code. The extension support in VSCode means you get a lightweight editor while still getting Intellisense; the [PowerShell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) even just hit 1.0.  That being said, VSCode is noticeably slower to open than Notepad++. I generally keep Notepad++ installed for opening things like quick text files, config files, etc. and only use VSCode for scripting."
2282,Vscode sublime or atom
2283,I use Ultraedit because I got used to it before there were many alternatives around. It's similar to Notepad++. Ultraedit uses Javascript as its scripting language. Very customizable. Not free.
2284,wordpad
2285,Sublime Text. Easy customisation and extensibility.  For PowerShell scripts I also recommend the ISE that ships with Windows.
2286,"Just wanted to point out that while sublime is really nice, it costs quite a bit.   Notepad++ has a really old school interface. Not good or bad, really just a matter of preference. Also they recently had an issue with a vulnerable library, but that​ is probably fixed.  My personal favorite is vs code because of its clean interface and extendability."
2287,I like atom.io
2288,"Notepad++ is definitely a good one. Geddit is another good one that's free and open source that works on multiple platforms.  [EDIT]: Geddit, stupid autocorrect. "
2289,Visual Studio Code
2290,"I love Notepad++, but I've had it play funny games with tabs and spaces in python scripts.    Pretty much got to go with Visual Studio Code for the lighter side of things. I've always got it open for something or other.  And that's coming from someone who pretty much uses emacs as his OS."
2291,"By far Sublime. It's quick, simple and elegant. The other Electron based text editors (VS Code, atom.io, etc.) may be flashy and feature packed but the start time for them is horrible if you just want to quickly edit a simple text file. Not to mention the monstrous amount of RAM that they have to use."
2292,All alternate to Sublime is HippoEDIT.
2293,"Jedit is good, there are lots of plugins for it. Also Notepad++."
2294,"The only ones I recommend are sublime, atom, and visual studio code. I personally use VSCode myself, and atom at work. Notepad++ is good for quick fixes."
2295,Brackets isn't terrible
2296,"I recommend Atom, Notepad++ for quick edits."
2297,"I would really like to find an editor which I find as comfortable as TeXshop for Mac OS X. Things which I miss:   - find/replace as a single unified dialog, with multiple line fields for both find and replace text, and good support for Regular Expressions  - support for emacs keyboard shortcuts (TeXshop gets this for free)  - support for native text objects so that it works well on systems w/o powerful CPUs (writing this out on an Atom tablet) and interactions such as handwriting recognition  - some sort of plug-in system for things such as sorting the current selection (in lieu of Mac OS X's Services)"
2298,Vim is best because it has more than 2 and less than 4 letters. It's nice compromise between ed and nano :) 
2299,Yes but if you alias vi as vim is vim as good as ed? Does that mean nvim is as  good as nano :^)?
2300,"> Honestly, I would like some honest answers as to where is Vim lacks or situations I'm better off using a different text editor/IDE  Vim sucks at understanding your project structure and code. IDEs are typically much, much better at this. Efforts to close that gap are generally complicated, hackish, and subsequently fragile.  Vim's great strength is raw text manipulation, emphasis on ""raw"" because its understanding of that text, semantically, is generally poor.  > Every time I start a new job or my smug colleagues are like: ""huehue, this guy still vims, I havent used vim since college, its 2018 bro"". Just grinds my gears.  Get better at Vim. My colleagues very quickly realize that my Vim usage is a super power, not a throwback or liability. I've *routinely* had people looking over my shoulder say ""WTF?"", because my editor is doing crazy shit to text seemingly on its own. Any time I do co-development, or screenshare my development work, people are blown away at what's happening in my editor compared to what they're using to seeing in theirs. Just get good at Vim and you'll have no need to justify it. It will speak for itself.   Note, that people with strong mastery of good IDE tools, like Visual Studio + Resharper, can do similarly mind-blowing shit at a higher semantic level via templates and refactoring tools.  The most powerful position is to be master of both (via tools like ViEmu), where low level text manipulation is done via Vim's editing model, and semantic manipulation is done via IDE tools. "
2301,"Unlike many other old (Emacs) or young (Atom, VSCode, etc.) editors, and unlike every IDE ever, Vim's architecture has never really been designed with extensibility in mind. It just doesn't have what it takes to be a *platform* so you get hack-ish plugins that compete with each others for mappings and CPU cycles.  Things are starting to look better for the IDE-envy crowd thanks to LSP, though."
2302,"> LSP?  https://langserver.org/  > What precisely do you mean by not having what it takes to be a platform?  * It doesn't expose an ""extension"" API that would help developers build a coherent UX across plugins without overlapping mappings and autocommands and stuff. * It's still single threaded and the current implementation of ""async"" only allows to use external programs asynchronously, which is nearly useless.  > Most plugins work great and can be customized for your own benefit, however you want to map them.  No. Most plugins are poorly written and have overlapping features, thanks to the lack of API I mentioned above.  > CPU cycles - I'm not sure this is a problem since vim is so lightweight, I've never had a problem even with large projects.  Vim is single threaded so whatever you or your plugins do must wait for whatever else you or your plugins did and will block whatever you or your plugins will try to do in the near future. The recent ""async"" feature only allows running *external* commands asynchronously so vimscript, Ex commands and macros are still synchronous.  > I feel that most IDE's are bloated, with too many features you don't need.  IDEs are built to support specific needs and workflows. I'm lucky enough to not have such needs and workflows right now but I did, before, and may do one day, and you can bet your ass I will just use the right tool for the job.  > You can basically create an IDE from vim just by extending it's functionality via plugins.  No. You can create something that looks like an IDE if you squint hard enough."
2303,Well said. I personally enjoy the mixed environments the most. I use VS Code with their (excellent) Vim plugin. 
2304,"vim isn't the best editor:  >Of course, on the system I administrate, vi is symlinked to ed. Emacs has been replaced by a shell script which 1) Generates a syslog message at level LOG_EMERG; 2) reduces the user's disk quota by 100K; and 3) RUNS ED!!!!!!"
2305,"C is still widely used. Sure, web folks don't use it, but it's the defacto microcontroller language, and we're surrounded by them. Plus, there's tons of ECUs in cars running C code. As an embedded engineer I had to reply :)"
2306,Vim is the best editor because it can be spelled in so many incorrect ways that it's like a cornucopia for pedant grammar nazis.
2307,I don't give a crap about any text editor wars. I try out many as well. I still don't have a favorite one. Currently using micro as my text editor. The only one I'm really fawn of is ne. I vim and even emacs. I guess I just like them all. I just switch to another one. When I feel like it. Currently my main text editor is micro for now.
2308,Micro is great out of the box! I recommend it for first time programming students who need to edit over SSH. Of course if they are keen for more I'll point them in the direction of vimtutor 
2309,Honestly I've been really content with VSCode + Vim Mode plugin. It gives me the raw text manipulation power of  Vim with the high level semantic understanding of VSCode. 
2310,Similar here. My favorite is Pycharm / IntelliJ with Vim Plugin.
2311,"When designing hardware with vhdl or verilog, there are very few existing vim plug-ins that really help your work and you need to do a lot on your own. Especially vhdl's redundancy can be coded very efficiently in others editors, where I lack configurations for vim. "
2312,vim is the best one with my config:  https://github.com/tracyone/vinux
2313,"If you're asking this in the context of ""I need an editor that I can quickly download/use in various places"", Notepad++ is very good.  Otherwise, it's still good but you'll be noticing some of the annoyances in it (like hanging on big files)."
2314,"Another vote for notepad++ from me.  I love how far this application has come.  I do some list management for email campaigns and routinely work with csv/delimited files that are anywhere from 200KB to 35MB in size (over 1.4 million email addresses, in the file I'm looking at now).  Doing a find/replace on this 35MB file does cause it to lock up--never really had to try that before--but otherwise most things are pretty fast as long as the file size isn't redonkulous.  If I'm doing something like crunching data that intensive, I'll generally bring it into Access anyway and run a query."
2315,"yea notepad++ is good and has a lot of features, but its also a little 2 loaded. and big. i like textpad instead."
2316,"I use npp for general lightweight text editing, vim for heavy duty editing and Komodo for coding, so take your pick. They are all excellent at what they do."
2317,"I use Notepad++ but I don't like how the menus are insanely bloated.  It's not so bad that I'm actively searching for something else, but I'll certainly look through this Ask Reddit hoping to read about something better."
2318,I use Notepad++[Free] and Editplus 2
2319,EditPlus is great :)
2320,Touche pussy cat it is fantastic - I use it to code in Python in win32.  I also use GVim when I feel the need to rip my own nipples off.
2321,I prefer gvim on Windows -- and on the Vista machines I'm forced to use a lot of the time where gvim seems to get angry? Then I use some pretty awesome Notepad++.
2322,"What's wrong with gvim on Vista? I use it every day just fine. It seems to slow down a bit on really large log files, but probably not moreso than any other editor."
2323,"I remember that TextEdit (I think that's what it's called, shareware editor with a large blue T for a logo) could handle huge files (GB-sized) with surprising ease, it would just open up like the file was a few KB long. I was impressed by that, and couldn't find another program that does that. Otherwise, it was not that special, so I don't use it any more."
2324,"I've ditched UltraEdit completely since getting acquainted with gvim. I've always been proficient at using vi when doing *nix administration, but watching Bram Molenaar's [7 habits of effective text editing 2.0](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2538831956647446078) got me curios about it - and I haven't looked back since.  Btw. I use gvim on Vista every day and have yet to encounter any problems."
2325,"Oh, I love me some vim action too. I actually SSH into another machine so I can work in the command line (or just do it locally if I'm on my Gentoo installs) and it's pretty wicked awesome. <3 vim!  The issue I have with gvim/Vista isn't, I don't think, Vista itself -- it's the particular install on which I don't have admin access or persistent changes (literally I have to install some things every. time. I use them. It's fun!)"
2326,">By far the most powerful programmers editor is Slickedit. It also happens to be the most expensive at ~US$300 per seat.  Emacs is turing-complete, how much more powerful can it get? Oh, and it's free, too."
2327,"Emacs, although the question is sort of like asking ""what is the best hammer to put a nail through my palm?"" "
2328,Because he's asking for a Windows text editor and we all know Windows is the OS Hitler would build if he was in CS?
2329,Emacs is perfectly happy on Windows.
2330,I mean developing on Windows is a huge hassle.
2331,"I'm torn between downmodding you for Emacs (I use the editor of the beast -- vi vi vi!) and upmodding you solely for the fast that I read it as ""what is the best hammer to put a nail through my -penis-?"""
2332,"I use viper-mode in emacs.  Vi is a great text editor, it just lacks a good text editor operating system."
2333,I'm a big fan of TextPad: http://textpad.com/
2334,FTW.
2335,Notepad 2 for simple stuff. http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html  EditPlus for more complex stuff. http://www.editplus.com/
2336,"Download cygwin, and use bash & vim."
2337,"You can just use gvim for windows, unless there is a pressing need for bash."
2338,"For programming, it's not just about an editor. Bash and Linux tools can be extremely useful in conjunction with your editor: grep, awk, sed, find, ls, ctags, etc.  What I often discover with Windows text editors is there is a specific feature I wish it had so that I could do some laborious, repetitive process very quickly. Using a shell with an editor in Linux, it's not a matter of wishing a feature exists - because **there is always a way to do it.** It's just a matter of finding out how."
2339,"gvim... it's vim, what else could you ask for?"
2340,any TextMate ripoff? :)
2341,Haven't seen anyone mention [e-TextEdtor](http://www.e-texteditor.com/).  I got hooked on TextMate at work and now use E on windows -- love it.
2342,I've been using [Crimson Editor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com) for as long as I can remember. And it's open source.
2343,notepad++  the best hands down
2344,"...of the free ones.  But since I haven't actually tried a non-free one, I'll say Notepad++ as well.  It's not without its annoyances, but it's good."
2345,putty + vi
2346,vim
2347,"PSPad is very good (and free). Ultraedit is good as a paid solution, though the only reason I like it beter than PSPad is because it supports SFTP transfer to remote hosts."
2348,PSPad is what I install on all my Windows boxes.
2349,"pspad++ - mostly when i need a windows editor it's to do some quick work on my website from a borrowed computer, and its built in ftp mode is very nice"
2350,"I use it for coding in PHP (built-in ftp uploader, html preview, color translator, md5 checksums) and coding for A7 GameStudio (compile by linking to the exe ""acknex.exe %File%"")  Bracket locating, multi-highlighter, lots of cool stuff in it. In fact, I've never had an idea for PSPad *that wasn't already implemented*."
2351,"ultraedit, but notepad++ is free"
2352,"Another vote for UltraEdit here. It's tremendously powerful and always gets the job done for me, though I don't use many of its more advanced features. I also don't think it has been maintained particularly well; it's a little rough around the edges, with more modern features like text antialiasing feeling poorly bolted-on. And it has suffered tremendously from feature creep (but I suppose the marketing department has to get their due).  Ultra-Edit really has two killer features for me:  1. Perl regular expression support! I could not use an editor without this. Though Ultra-Edit's implementation seems to choke on a few of the edge cases and more obscure Perl-introduced features (even though they've been standardized for years now...)  2. Shell extension: I can right-click any file and open it in Ultra-Edit with just one more click. This is absolutely awesome once you have it, and something I always miss on my Linux desktop."
2353,"Notepad++ also has shell extension (which, agreed, is an amazing addition!)  It also supports regular expressions in its find/replace function.  I'm not too well-versed in regular expressions so I don't really know if Perl regular expressions differ from what is offered in Notepad++."
2354,"Good point.  I almost never use Windows, so it never really came up for me."
2355,"It's really a whole-package deal; Ultra-Edit is a text and hex editor that just works pretty smoothly, and can deal with anything I throw at it, from 1 kB text files to 100MB of binary garbage I have to sift through for some stupid reason. The feature creep is more an argument against wasting money on unneeded upgrades; usually, I 'upgrade' the editor whenever it gets installed on a new system, and leave it at that. Version 14 looks pretty useless (much like the Vista it seems to have been designed for); Version 13, what's installed on this machine, is snappy enough; Version 10 or 11 is also just fine.  As to regular expressions, they're very common in the Unix world (though Perl-compatible ones are not nearly as common as I would like), and *standardized*. For some bloody reason, every Windows developer likes to re-implement his own fucked-up piece of shit regular expression engine. Ultra-Edit has its own retarded syntax, but it is easily configured to use Perl-compatible REs, unlike another editor I use for writing LaTeX, WinEdt, which is stuck on its own brain-damaged REs with no option to change.  Shell extensions are one area of the Windows world that I am happily mostly ignorant of, but Ultra-Edit integrates using a custom DLL. The integration Just Works, and that's good enough for me."
2356,"I haven't used it, but so far I haven't heard anything that makes me want to try the payware UltraEdit over Notepad++. What does the former do that the latter doesn't, or more importantly what does the former do *better* than the latter? I ask because I'm curious, not because I have some unhealthy devotion to a random software option.  > As to regular expressions...  In my experience regular expressions are always implemented slightly differently from program to program. I've never gotten used to ""one"" version, but AFAIK Notepad++ uses the basic, near-universal Perl syntax. At least, if it doesn't I've a) never noticed and b) never done something that made it obvious.  > Shell extensions are one area of the Windows world that I am happily mostly ignorant of, but Ultra-Edit integrates using a custom DLL. The integration Just Works, and that's good enough for me.  Notepad++, since it is the main alternative/competitor, does this as well. For future reference:  * In XP: Control Panel, Folder Options. Choose a file type and click Advanced. You can edit more entries to the list or change the default (usually Open or Edit if it is a text file).  * In Vista: Control Panel, Default Programs. I don't use it much so I can't give much more advice, but look in there and you'll probably find it."
2357,"Notepad++ looks like a very nice editor for the (lack of any) price. I have to say, I probably wouldn't use Ultra-Edit if I had to pay full price for it, but there are plenty of discounts if you know where to look. I've also been using Ultra-Edit for years and years, since long before Notepad++ came out (late 2003, if Wikipedia hasn't lied to me again), so some of my recommendation is probably just inertia.  Ultra-Edit is a full hex editor, not just text editor. For me, this is an extremely important feature; for you, perhaps not. This is probably the most significant difference between the two.  Notepad++ appears to support only standard Unix/POSIX regular expressions, a subset of the more powerful and more recent Perl regular expression standard. I use a few Perl/PCRE features fairly often, so this is something I notice when I'm stuck with a Unix RE engine.  Notepad++'s shell extension is probably just as capable as Ultra-Edit's, since I don't imagine it's that hard to write a shell extension. Both are certainly preferable to your file type trick; that only works for certain file types, while a shell extension makes right-click editing of *any* file possible. Not so useful for a text editor, I agree, but very nice for a *hex* editor, since it can chew on binary files as well as text.  So my conclusion is that Notepad++ is probably a fine editor, but Ultra-Edit has a few features that Notepad++ lacks, features which I would miss. You may not, in which case the free alternative is clearly superior."
2358,"there is a hex-editor for notepad++ available as a plugin: [link](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189927&package_id=222593)  it's not difficult to install, just copy the dll to notepad++'s plugin directory and it will be available under the plugins menu"
2359,UltraEdit
2360,"Just to be different than all the Notepad++ people: [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html). I like my text editors to edit text, not code, by default, so I like them to be as unobtrusively Notepad-like as possible.  Basically, take Notepad and drop in more menu entries/keyboard shortcuts for common text manipulation tasks, simple line numbering and code highlighting. That's it.  I actually like it just because it's the only text editor (besides Notepad itself) *without* tabs--I don't live in my text editor, so I don't want it to think it should own every text file I open. It should be small enough that there can be one instance of it open for every file open."
2361,"I have to say Notepad++ too, although I typically use Notepad, since the lack of a need for a Windows text editor has prevented me from downloading Notepad++."
2362,ConTEXT is worth a look: http://www.contexteditor.org
2363,Komodo Edit and Notepad++ are both fantastic.

2367,I like Ultraedit.
2368,Windows Notepad
2369,Notepad++
2370,Textpad is pure awesome.
2371,"""Best"" is rather utterly subjective, but the ones I've used/liked are..  - Programmers Notepad: Very simple, fairly customizable. Doesn't have much in the way of scriptability. Is free. - e Text Editor: Paid. Basically a TextMate clone on Windows (supports textmate bundles, and is programmable in shell-script/python/ruby/etc). - Sublime Text: I really like this editor, it does things very sensible - although it's still quite early in development. Supports TextMate .tmBundles too now. First text editor I've seen to put emphasis on a tiling UI."
2372,"Agreed, Sublime Text seems quite promising to me with a solid foundation, but it seems development has kind of stalled since the guy behind it [got married](http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/just-married). ;) (yes, seriously... even the betas are quite few and far between with no big steps forward now with three minor betas since june)"
2373,"I like JEdit on Windows. On Linux, where do I even begin? Bluefish for HTML, GEdit for notes and such, Vim for anything from the terminal..."
2374,visual studio 2008
2375,While VS 2008 is great it's a bit heavy for text editing.
2376,"I often have problems getting distracted by email, reddit, etc. while working, so for me, I use DarkRoom. It's just a full-screen, simple text editor. Not good for writing research papers, though, but excellent for creative writing."
2377,"First, thanks for the thread. I spent a lot of time trying to find a good one and finally started working with the free (time limited) version of UltraEdit. The thing I most wanted it to do though was highlight the differences in a couple of files opened side by side, and could sometimes get that to work for a large part of the files, but sometimes (if I remember right) not at all. Finally did it manually.  And thanks for all the comments and suggestions. I now have at least one more to check out next time I need one."
2378,[Win32Pad](http://www.gena01.com/win32pad/) is a cool alternative to Notepad for simple editing.   32k file size and is only limited by the amount of memory you have when opening large files.
2379,EmEditor. It can open big files and do all of the things that a text editor should be able to do.
2380,ultraedit
2381,Linux.
2382,That's because you only like FLCL.
2383,"On Windows, did you aptitude install decent-operating-system?"
2384,VS code 
2385,This. JetBrains products are very good and reasonably priced but VS Code is 98+% as good and it's hard to be more reasonably priced than free.
2386,"How?  Edit: Figured it out, if you run two seperate VS Code processes you can drag a tab from one to another. Still not quite as nice as Visual Studio for example but useful!"
2387,"I got a U3818DW, its a great panel for software development, I also do some photo/video editing and crypto/stock trading on it. All of the screen real estate combined with the Dell Display manager makes it really easy to arrange all of my windows in specific configurations depending on what I'm doing.  Also, even though its not billed as a gaming panel, I can't really see any issues playing fast paced shooters like Hunt: Showdown or RTS games like Company of Heroes 2."
2388,"Yeah, I've been down this road too. Jetbrains feels very, I dunno, managed? Like it feels like someone thought of it before I got there and had a solution ready every time. Very little cobbling together."
2389,I haven't done that specifically with PHP (only used it for that a little bit) but you can do basically that with JavaScript so it's probably worth checking out. 
2390,I also agree. If you care about extra tooling then jetbrains products are worth it. Webstorm only cost me 40 bucks for the year. Seems like a lot since vs code is free but I get my money's worth. It's definitely saved me more than an hour over the course of a year and that's basically my hour freelancing rate. 
2391,"I've never used vscode, but my jetbrains subscription is completely worth it compared to say atom or sublime.   But if vscode is quite close to phpstorm in quality and functionality, then maybe it's worth thinking about."
2392,"That's really interesting, I used to subscribe to Her brains WebStorm but found that VSCode had all the features that I actually wanted and was a lot more efficient on runtimes. It also startups a lot quicker and with extensions is customised to my exact needs.   Cancelled my subscription. "
2393,"It depends on the language and the quality of the addon. JS and TS for example are directly integrated and work perfectly with all the features that you describe, and I heard the C# one is also quite nice.  I remember that PHP and Ruby with Sublime and Atom were crap to use though, so I always went back to Jetbrains. Dunno about the VS Code equivalents"
2394,I use JetBrains for others language but not web development. I found JetBrains does not have as many extensions to integrate with compare to VS Code.
2395,If I was paid to use emacs I still wouldn't do it
2396,I never could get used to Emacs myself but the people I have seen who know it well have godlike editing efficiency with it.
2397,I stayed on atom way too long.. VS code is rad
2398,WebStorm. It's an IDE. 
2399,"Most shit works ""out of the box"" and there is generally no need to install any extensions. Compare that to VSCode: you have to install a shitload of extensions for you to get to work the way you want. "
2400,"Have you used Angular with VSCode? Because I just couldn't without searching for this and that. Meanwhile, with WebStorm, right off the bat, it's compatible with Angular syntax and Typescript. "
2401,I use vim but I know that’s unusual. I’ve heard really good things about VS Code though. 
2402,"I keep considering switching from vim to VSCode, but I always end up wasting time removing "":w"" from all my files."
2403,"Have you tried the vim mode plugin for VSCode, it would solve that problem... I had it too "
2404,Unusual? I don't know anyone who doesn't use vim in my company and the companies we did work for.
2405,"I don't know that many people that use vim as their day to day editor. I decided to check the [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#development-environments-and-tools) and sure enough, vim usage is fairly high — higher than I expected — but amongst web devs, it's 6th on the list."
2406,"All of my dev machines are remote so I use vim if I want to make quick fixes from the shell, say for fixing up a small merge conflict or something. Otherwise, I use an IDE."
2407,"If you use plugins you can use most features of an IDE. The only things that i know vscode has and vim doesnt is vscode live share and a good debugger. find all references, autocomplete, async linting, auto importing etc all are in vim with some configuration"
2408,Ill definitely check that out. The reason why I use vscode for debugging is its ability to debug typescript. I use typescript in all my projects and it doesn't look like there is a debugger for typescript in vim. I could debug the javascript generated but that would be annoying
2409,"Well, ts might be an issue. It claims to work with any debugger that uses the DBGP protocol and has been tested with PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, Tcl and NodeJS. So I guess it'd depend on the existence of a ts debugger using DBGP. I've only actually used it with PHP, which is all I need at the moment. "
2410,"I switched from vscode back to vim. Somehow the performance of the vscode has gotten a bit worse than it was before. It gets laggy and sometimes even freezes when opening very large workspaces, or when you accidentally open very large file. I was using the vim extension with vscode, but i think it made the performance worse.  You get pretty much same vscode functions and tools out of the vim if you install right plugins and configs."
2411,I was in your shoes then I decided to give intellij a shot for a couple weeks just to try something new.  Never even thought about switching back. Even a year later I'm still discovering awesome new things it can do for me.   Also I feel bad saying this but now I kind of judge my coworkers who use atom and sublime. Like *you have no idea what you're missing.*
2412,"Doesn't matter how many packages you've installed, Sublime will always be a text editor, not an IDE. "
2413,"it's definitely true, but I just have a very comfortable workflow and muscle memory with sublime.  with how I work I think sublime is probably what ill stick with for a while."
2414,"I was where you were a few months ago, then a collegue showed me VS Codes Live Share. That's when I decided it was time to switch. :)"
2415,Phpstorm
2416,"Spacemacs. IMO a better implementation of Vim, and I can no longer live without org-mode. "
2417,"There is `org-mode` for Vim, although it was primarily developed for GNU Emacs."
2418,"If you're already using an electron-based IDE you should really try out VS Code.  It's insane the uptake rate that MS has gotten on it, and the plugin architecture is really great.  They also have really fast file level searching with ripgrep, and it has a ton of optimizations.  I too stuck with Atom + Notepad++ for a long time, but I have switched to VS Code and it's really all that and a bag of potato chips just like everyone says."
2419,I'm with you. I like VS code but was already more familiar with atom and didn't feel like switching.
2420,Atom by GitHub.
2421,"Vim and only vim. I debug with it, I write and run my db queries in it, and I've written dozens of mappings and scripts to simplify working on the projects I work on and to completely customize my dev environment."
2422,Google docs
2423,"NotePad++, and VS Code."
2424,"Me too, quick stuff with notepad++ and the the dev stuff with VSc "
2425,"Acme, sam (only for taking notes), and GNU Emacs. [Here's](https://bitbucket.org/tux_/dotfiles/src/bbdfd82c6bd4f9205625c952eec4f7e5434cf581/emacs/?at=default) my `.emacs` file, the other two are left default.  VS Code is ""fine"", but it is too slow on all of my computers. If you like its look and feel, Sublime Text would be a good fourth option."
2426,"Vim (used to use Sublime), IntelliJ for Java and obviously Xcode for Apple stuff."
2427,pychram
2428,"VS code ,it is fast (enough),easy to use and easily customizable with extensions. "
2429,"Vs is everything but not fast. Electron is not fast, nor is atom or vs. "
2430,I love VS code but I have had issues with using it for large files. If I open certain files in VS code it will freeze. I have to switch to atom and open the file there which is pretty frustrating
2431,"Strange since atom is also electron based... mmm Try using any native editor, maybe vim, sublime or notepad++"
2432,"Not sure why you are getting downvoted. This is 100% true. Sublime feels WAY faster, but in the end, I still end up using VSCode because of its features."
2433,"I also use vscode, but it's not fast. You got tons of stuff that just mitigate that effect overall. The issue however relies on electron, not VScode itself."
2434,"Well, there are a few keys to consider here:  \- The fact that we have faster computers doesn't mean that new software like electron isn't slow. It is slow compared to many alternatives  \- When I use VScode in a 3 screen setup and the other 2 screens have videos / anything GPU demanding, you can start seeing lag on the VScode, even when scrolling.  \- I use VScode as well, not ditching it, It's great, but the tech behind it it's not, however without that tech we would not have the number of plugins and customization that we do.     "
2435,Notepad++ all the way.
2436,IntelliJ. 
2437,"Used to be a Sublime Text 3 nut, just because I like something simple.   And then I discovered VS Code. Does the same thing, its light weight, but lets me jump around when I look at a function/class definition or whatever. Has extensions to let me do my job faster, and looks cool."
2438,And it's much slower than Sublime Text according to my own perception.
2439,N++
2440,Neovim or Vim on the server Atom or Brackets on the desktop
2441,Atom 
2442,"Do you do Java development?  If not, WebStorm is like intelliJ but focused more for javascript and general front-end web development.   I've been using it for years and love it.  Tried other lighter editors but ended up installing so many plugins that Webstorm just comes with already."
2443,VS Code + Live Server extension
2444,Text editor - Neovim  IDE - VS Code (with IDE extensions)
2445,Seems like I might be the only one who uses Atom.  Tried VS Code and it's just not the same. 
2446,Atom just feels so freaking sluggish.
2447,Sublime for quick stuff and VS Code for everything else. I used to love PHPStorm but it got so slow and awful. 
2448,"I'm including what you'd call IDEs in this list: PhpStorm, VS Code, Npp, Brackets.  Which depends on the specific activity.  Npp is what I use if what I really want is a text editor.  The others are for more involved development processes:  * PhpStorm for development/debugging in PHP * VS Code for development/debugging of Node.js applications * Brackets for quick local deployment of frontend projects and sometimes debugging of frontend code"
2449,"I use both VSCode and Intellej. VSCode for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. IntelliJ for Java AND no it is not slow like what other people said it actually helps me code Java faster."
2450,VSCode + Vim Mode through the extension.   
2451,"Sublime Text 3, but for bigger projects VS Code. "
2452,"I use TextMate on my Mac, and Coda2 on iPad Pro. "
2453,"I switched to VS code about a month ago from Sublime, was reluctant to switch but am glad I did. "
2454,"Another one VS Code here.  Besides Microsoft office, VS Code is the only other ""best in class"" product to come out of Microsoft, in my opinion."
2455,"Visual Studio (proper) is one hell of an IDE. It's definitely not the most elegant, but it's just a powerhouse of capability. "
2456,Another person using vs code. I did use eclipse back when I was coding in Java. I used notepad+ as well back when I was on Windows for some really light stuff.
2457,VS Code
2458,I like using Brackets. It’s just so comfortable for me to use. 
2459,Sublime Text 3 is honestly the best. Beautiful syntax and customizability
2460,Right now Atom but usee Brackets before which was bomb af
2461,Atom.io 
2462,Atom with a ton of packages and a nice theme
2463,Vscode ftw
2464,"Vscode for python, php. Vs for dotnet development. I've found vscode to be an amazing IDE when used with the right addons."
2465,"I finally gave in and tried VS Code, and it lived up to the hype in my opinion. So I stuck with it."
2466,"I'm using **VS Code** and I prefer **Text Editor** rather than an **IDE**.  &#x200B;  I chose VS Code over Atom cause it's more lightweight than atom, loads faster and looks better.  it's also supports extensions and have an active community.  (being lightweight, fast and being an Editor nor an IDE were my factors)"
2467,Neovim. 
2468,"I was a Sublime fanboy until I tried VSCode with it's extensions. Holy fuck that thing is great (Specially the react extensions, they save a lot of time)."
2469,"VS Code is the best. IntelliJ runs very poorly on my system (people say Java is fast, but it really isn't)."
2470,I’m still in high school and just starting out. I use Brackets.
2471,I used to use Brackets at the beginning for college work but then I moved over to IntelliJ as I find it better and I could use one IDE for full stack development 
2472,VS17 Enterprise and PHPStorm
2473,"For single text documents, Notepad++. Anything more complex I switch to an IDE."
2474,Sublime Text. That is all.
2475,"[Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are both pretty and quite functional. I personally give a slight edge to Atom because I like its package diversity and it's open source, but both are really great"
2476,Atom won't be free when version 1 comes out but it will be worth the price IMO.
2477,Vim isnt Ugly o.O?
2478,I've come to love using Notepad++ for editing code/text + built in spell check works well.  http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ 
2479,"I agree with you, but just to point out what OP said:   >I don't like to use VIM or Notepad++ because they're ugly  He/she is looking for alternates to it"
2480,"TextPad is pretty nice. It's macros are a bit more straightforward than Notepad++ I've found. It seems to be stuck in time, but I think that's a good thin :)"
2481,"I like ActiveState's KomodoEdit. The main reason is it has similar or identical features and behavior and look and feel on Linux and Windows and Mac. I can switch OS's and have at least a text editor with the same look and feel, function keys, macros, ... Yes, people will say the same about emacs or vim or similar, but if you're looking for alternatives... "
2482,"Emacs can be rather beautiful.  Seriously, as this is about **free** software: Have you tried the ST clone [Lime Text](http://www.limetext.org) or - if you like ribbons - [BowPad](http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/BowPad.html)?"
2483,I've never heard of Lime Text but it looks almost exactly like what i'm looking for. I'm being told to use Sublime Text but technically it's not a free product. Sure evaluation is indefinite but that's not free. Thanks a ton!
2484,Adobe's free and open source [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) looks pretty neat.
2485,"Brackets is what I use on a daily, and I quite like it. Works for any language really."
2486,I always use Notepad++ and Sublime Text but Sublime Text is best off al editors.
2487,"Various things. My whiskey, preferably. I don't need to adore the window decorations all the time."
2488,"I'm a coder, not a designer. Emacs on full-screen (with no visible GUI elements) is *quite* pleasing with a decent theme."
2489,If you want a good slim editor with good package control try [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). If you want an IDE with really good Java and C++ support try [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/) out.
2490,"Vim personally. Simple, but has everything I need. I've looked into other options, but personally none provide anything that would make me want to stay. Emacs seemed promising, but I quickly learned that it would be a challenge because I was born deformed (I only have 10 fingers)."
2491,"Vim (more precisely neovim) and Emacs are my weapon of choice.  Basically, I'm using neovim for coding and Emacs for administrative tasks. It's a weird mix that I organically grew into."
2492,"id pick vim as an editor on emacs as well, it doesn’t have a very good one"
2493,VSCodium takes Microsoft telemetry out of VSCode so the app doesn’t phone home — if you care about privacy.  Otherwise it tries to be the same as VSCode.
2494,Wonder if VSCodium has arm64 builds.  I have official VSCode on my PC Ubuntu install (which is on an external SSD so I can swap it between my machines) but I wanted a good code editor for my Nintendo Switch (running L4T Ubuntu 18.04) and VSCode wasn't distributed for arm64.
2495,According to the release notes for VSCodium 1.32.0 ([https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases)) they did some work with arm64 - you might be in luck :)
2496,Microsoft's binary still has other tricks up its sleeve
2497,But VS Code is also open source. What's the point of this?
2498,"VSCode is not open source. It's based on an open source project, but builds from Microsoft have telemetry and other non-open components."
2499,In terminal: Vi/Vim  GUI: Sublime Text
2500,I personally use vs code with vs-vim (I think it's called). It's surprisingly good!  However I recall the available vim packages for sublime were mediocre or way too much of a hassle to install
2501,Try atom I find it most reliable and it has amazing plugins to help you with anything.
2502,"My most used editors:  nano - Simple command line editor, preinstalled on most distros, non-standard key bindings but they're listed on screen.  Good for basic editing, but it is limited in what all it can do.  micro - A command line editor that tries to be an improvement of nano.  Uses familiar Windows style keybindings for the most part.  On screen prompt for accessing keybindings and help.  Good mouse support for a text-mode program.  Good balance of features and ease of use.  vim - I've never wanted to sit down and relearn everything I know about editors to be able to operate vim effectively.  It is powerful, but it has its own keybindings and command conventions and I'd say it's not easy to use for that reason.  I know enough to do basic edits when a system only has vim (or vi) but that's about it.  gedit - I haven't really liked gedit since the transition from GNOME 2 to 3.  Old gedit (forked as pluma in mate) is pretty good but the new gedit UI is weird and unnecessarily dumbed down.  The search function using the up and down keys breaks convention shared by a lot of other editors, where enter keeps searching.  VSCode - I've been using this a lot at work and it is available on Linux as well.  Seems to do a great job at finding symbols in files even across a large project.  I mainly do C and C++ though.  Git integration, built in file compare mode, good search features, and familiar keybinds (for the most part, but you can rebind easily as well).  Fluid UI with nice themes.  Downside - it's based on Electron and eats resources.  Notepad++ (Windows only) - Another good editor, familiar keybindings, good multiline editing, good search features.  I use this one at work a lot too.  It works in Wine on Linux too."
2503,">Good for basic editing, but it is limited in what all it can do.  Nano should not be underestimated. The editor offers much more than just the functions displayed in the lower bar.  https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html  https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html"
2504,"To be honest, I also assumed for a while that nano only has the functions mentioned in the bar. Only after reading the documentation ( originally because of the .nanorc file ) I realized that the editor is more powerful."
2505,"Nano never gets the love. I'm always using nano, or VSCode for anything more."
2506,"> Notepad++ (Windows only) - Another good editor, familiar keybindings, good multiline editing, good search features. I use this one at work a lot too. It works in Wine on Linux too.  There's also [NotepadQQ](https://notepadqq.com/s/), which is enough like Notepad++ that it's almost a direct port."
2507,"Fwiw, Kate also seems to have a similar layout and function set to notepad++. I haven't exactly a/b compared them, but they're both very rich in features and fairly easy to figure out"
2508,"> Notepad++ (Windows only)  Fun fact, Notepad++ embeds the FOSS Scintilla editing component. In other words, SCiTE on Linux is basically the same thing. There are some UI differences but the editing, folding, coloring, etc. are all the same."
2509,"Emacs via Spacemacs. It's not a small thing, but I use it for several things, so that's fine."
2510,"I chose vi to learn as an editor because of it's pervasive default availability in the \*NIX world, so I use it as my primary editor on everything, even Window$."

2512,I love VIM. I use it for coding web applications front and back.
2513,Emacs.
2514,I use vim since most of the time I am in terminal. I wanna try emacs soon tho
2515,"Kate, because it works well for simple text editing (which is what I do)."
2516,"Emacs, I've used emacsen since 1982, since around 1987 mostly GNU Emacs.  Compared to e.g. vi/vim it's ""mode free"" regarding input versus control. That is, you are all the time in ""insert mode"" and perform the commands with Ctrl-keys. The basic Ctrl-keys are the same as the default editing keys in bash. It is easily programmed using emacs lisp, where the original Multics emacs I used was programmed in MacLisp (has nothing with Mac to do), and it has several types of macros, that is recording your key strikes to repeat the same thing over and over, and a macro can be compiled to a lisp function.  It can be used in ""server mode"" which implies that you only need to have one instance of the editor running despite you open it from the command line in different terminal windows.  Regarding python, I consider it not ideal, as by default a program line, due to python's white space syntax is not unambiguous, will be reindented when it's ambiguous when pressing TAB. Therefore I've hacked both the python mode somewhat as well as my style of python programming, by introducing a [""safe"" block structure, like this](https://imgur.com/Xv2UyvJ). Regarding the other editor Geany, you mentioned, I don't know it at all, and regarding vim, I only know that I don't like it, I basically know only one command, how to exit the editor."
2517,">The basic Ctrl-keys are the same as the default editing keys in bash.   Actually, it's the other way round - bash uses emacs keys by default."
2518,Vim or if you want gui I personally recommend KATE.
2519,* Pluma * Nano
2520,"Vim or Geany. Both can be installed on Linux at home and at work behind our corporate firewall, which causes problems getting plugins for nearly everything else."
2521,I use Nano and Geany.
2522,Spacemacs. Basically emacs with vim flavor. It still blows me with minimal configuration yet seamless experience
2523,"I go for VS Code now because it is free and can be used across, Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.  Normally for Windows only, notepad++ is the best, but VSCode wins due to it's ubiquity"
2524,"It seems that I might be among the  last of the joe users, but it is the only editor I use in shell.  For the actual development I use jetbrains IDE.  I am used to phpstorm, so pycharm might not be the best IDE for python (or it may be), but the UI is the same as phpstorm so switching between is really easy (it is a bit of memory hog (java), but these days that is not even close to being an issue."
2525,"vi, or vscode... Yeah, I know, but vscode is pretty nice if your going to bother with a gui."
2526,I use nano a lot. Also vim.
2527,"It may not be in the ballpark you are looking for, but I purchased a lifetime license for Ultraedit maybe 15 years ago. Back then it was Windows only, but that is where I wrote most of my scripts from. These days, the license is cross platform.   I know there are many tools listed here that are more in line with the linux way, but the feature set, and ease of use is pretty outstanding and I still use it to this day. The key features that I really like are:  1. Code folding 2. Bookmarking 3. Column mode (including sum columns) 4. Easily recordable macros"
2528,"Lots of qtcreator these days, even for non-qt projects.  geany for most problems.  busybox vi for everything else."
2529,"Vim when I'm mostly in the terminal, gedit elsewhere."
2530,I use [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2531,Emacs.
2532,I use neovim for everything. It's basically vim but with better default settings and it feels faster (could be placebo though).
2533,Mostly Vim. Started out due to availability and working a lot through SSH on servers but eventually I got faster with it than with regular editors.
2534,Notepadqq and Qownnotes  &#x200B;  Notepadqq for anything complicated with markup.  &#x200B;  Qownnotes for general notes that syncs to my nextcloud and to my phone
2535,You seem to have an affinity for editors with the letter 'q' in their name XD  Notepadqq is the cross-platform version of Notepad++ isn't it? I loved N++ but switched to Geany for a more consistent experience between Windows and Linux. I hear good things about Nqq though :)
2536,"yeh, its pretty much notepad++ very little to differentiate it"
2537,Gui: leafpad Cli: nano
2538,"Kakoune.  Vim-like, just with a more usable design philosophy, better discoverability and interactivity."
2539,"If you know vim, just stick with it.  It's about as difficult to learn as emacs and it's just not worth it to duplicate the effort.  And, it's installed everywhere."
2540,Vim and gedit for me.
2541,"`emacs` usually. I don't spend enough time in a Linux editor to keep `vi` paged in. While `emacs` is not exactly intuitive, it's a lot easier to find out things like the right `M-x command`. Also a few of the keystrokes are implemented by default in MacOS, which I use quite a bit (although I think there is a way to switch to `vi` keystrokes)."
2542,"Vim ,and if yoimu fancy new shiny  tools, atom"
2543,microsoft powerpoint
2544,"I recently started using Atom and I'm really liking it so far. Project tree structure, multiple panes, git interface. Its also cross platform so I can use it in linux and windows. I mostly used Kate and Gedit in the past."
2545,"I don't use what you use, but here goes for my experience.  I love Vim's modal and verb-object way better than anything else. I want that everywhere I can. That said…  * For big projects and frameworks a good IDE that supports vim plugins would feel a mistake to ignore. With a lot of work, snippets and macros one could sort of replicate the workflow, but that would be a whole part of your life dedicated to it for a long time. I use PHPStorm for Symfony, so where you have jinja2 I have twig and where you have Python I have PHP, and trust me it's bloody awesome when I create a controller, a template and whatnot and the right use statements are included on the go. Hard to beat really. * When project-awareness is not warranted. Vim. But Spacemacs has qualities and defects of Vim with the best Vim emulation possible. Plus discoverability. Plus excellent defaults. Plus more or less standardized plugins ([layers](http://spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html)), sometimes making it WAY easier to get stuff up and running than spending the right amount of time and testing to find the right Vim plugin for you and the right way to install + configure it. With Spacemacs you put the name of the layer (eg ""yaml"") in the right place in the main dotfile (easy peasy), you reload and bam you're good to go with the community's preferred solution. I find that building an emacs config from the ground up is a tedious whole enterprise in and of itself, while building your favourite things on top of Spacemacs is fun.  If you feel like giving Spacemacs a go,  as a Vim fan with a terminal-multiplexer addiction (I love byobu to death), I'll suggest configuring your setup to use it as a daemon early on, so that once the daemon is started (ie at the init of the OS) you can start new instances way faster, and all communicating with one another. In terminal mode if you like ( ""-nw"").  &#x200B;  All that said, whenever I can I still use Vim (Neovim actually), because the more lightweight the better, always."
2546,"Personally I prefer Atom. I like the fact that you can transform it from a simple text editor to an IDE. Also I am not a big fan of command line apps in general, like vim. I find them a bit complicated to use."
2547,"I personally use vim for text editing, Atom sometimes, and Leafpad for an equivalent of notepad.exe"
2548,I've been using neovim lately and it's pretty great
2549,"If it's something small (one file, configuration files, etc), then vim or Sublime Text. If it's a larger project, I'll use VSCode. It has pretty good features out of the box (autocomplete, finding function definitions/usages), and as someone who generally uses git from the command line, I actually find myself using the git integration. It's also not too much of a memory hog and is generally pretty responsive. I used Sublime Text for a while, but it's kind of annoying because any kind of useful features you'd like from an IDE require 3rd party plugins, which can often break or slow down the editor."
2550,"9 times out of 10, it's either in Eclipse or IntelliJ."
2551,Either Vim or Emacs. There's no in between.
2552,"I’m all about VIM now I used to use nano because it was very simple but since VIM has syntax highlighting and other more advanced features, I made the switch."
2553,"I like both that your using.  &#x200B;  My webpages that I edit, I do use Geany.  &#x200B;  My main go to text editor right now is micro. [https://micro-editor.github.io/](https://micro-editor.github.io/)  &#x200B;  I like all text editors. My favorite GUI text editor is Pluma with all the plugins. My dearest CLI text editor has always been ne(nice editor). [http://ne.di.unimi.it/](http://ne.di.unimi.it/)  &#x200B;  To me there is no text editor war. What every works for you, that's the one you should be using."
2554,"Vim  Nano  VS Codium (not ""code"" !!!)  Atom  Gedit  Notepadqq   I use all of them depending on the task"
2555,"I'm using Atom for GUI, Nano for the console work."
2556,Was using atom. Transitioned to vim recently as I needed a command line only editor for something anyway and ended up liking it. Oh and nano I guess for like config files and simple stuff.
2557,"If I'm SSH'ing into a box and just editing config files or the like, then I use nano.  If I'm in a GUI doing development work, then I like Scite."
2558,vim + vim plugins
2559,Nano is flawless and efficient. Vim is powerful but has a learning curve. Sublime is user-friendly and colorful.
2560,"Cli: nano, vim  Gui: sublime, geany"
2561,+1 for Vim And tmux
2562,"I really like atom for GUI work... depends where you're doing your development though I suppose. I usually set up some sort of sftp and use the ftp built into atom and work directly off the server from my computer.   &#x200B;  As far as CLI, I'm a nano fan."
2563,* IDE: Eclipse * GUI text editor: Featherpad * CLI: nano
2564,VSCodium (VS Code without telemetry garbage) and micro for quick edits.
2565,Vim for the win xD
2566,Visual Studio Code is nice 
2567,i use vim. but i also  **enjoy sublimetext 3** (i can actually recommend it really strongly: https://www.sublimetext.com/ go check it out if you haven't heard of it. It's free for evaluation but support the devs if you enjoy it as much as i do)
2568,"I really enjoy atom because it looks pretty fancy, has some nice features and basically plugins for everything you could ever imagine \^\^.  If you are only coding on windows i heard visual studio code is pretty nice if you want some more ide like features.  Or if you want to be the most 1337 haxxor in existence you could go gui-less with something like emacs or vim. From my experience it takes sum time to learn all the shortcuts and stuff but if you mastered it you are probably faster and more efficient.  Happy coding \^\^  Edit: no one told me you had to escape those: ""\^""   xD"
2569,Visual Studio Code is cross platform and open source. You are probably mixing it up with Visual Studio. Vs Code is basically just a faster Atom
2570,Huh that's nice i didn't know that and no I'm not mixing them up ^^. I just took a look at vs Code and it seems pretty cool but atom just looks better (visually) in my opinion. What makes it so much better than atom tho? 
2571,"On Windows I use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). This works for day-to-day text editing and automatically has syntax highlighting for Python (which is mostly what I program in).  On Linux, I just use gedit, which seems to come standard with just about every distro, even the light ones.  On a Macbook I use [Atom](https://atom.io/). Atom supports all platforms so I might even give a try on my windows and linux boxes. "
2572,gedit because what more could you need other than a notepad with syntax highlighting and tabs?
2573,"MS Paint IDE is a little bit of both, satire and serious"
2574,"VSCode is more than a simple text editor, it's an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  I personally use VSCodium which is a fully open source fork of VSCode minus Microsoft telemetry and tracking   There's text editor like Notepad++ which can do the job, depending on your feature requirements.  You should specify which operating system you are using and which features you need so we can suggest some that fits your needs :)"
2575,"My os is linux and by features I mean extensions, code completion, intelli sense, etc. Classical IDE stuff"
2576,"Maybe a full IDE like NetBeans, Eclipse, Code:Blocks, KDevelop, or others? I like NetBeans. Then there are the classic Emacs and Vim (it important to understand that Emacs is clearly superior to Vim while Vim is clearly superior to Emacs). Both are ridiculously awesome but have a steep learning curve. Then there is Sublime Edit, but its not open.  As a side note, IntelliSense is very specific Microsoft as far as i know.  Atom and similar essentially browser based editors may be an alternative (i just read that Atom is now owner by Microsoft). VS Code actually is just one of these. There is a opensource fork of it."
2577,"Atom has been aquired by Microsoft, so it's out.   The two options I see that may fit are Geany (really lightweight in comparaison to vscode), or VSCodium"
2578,"Vim and Neovim are the best long-term, especially with advanced plugins such as coc.nvim that replicate the VSCode features."
2579,Atom is another choice.
2580,"Vim, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text can pretty much all do what VS Code can do if you want them to. Atom and Sublime are pretty close ootb?"
2581,Honestly it will be region and sometimes store specific.   When I was in NC Lowes had better lumber but here in NoVA HD has better lumber.   I buy a lot of other items at lowes due to pricematch/10% off but HD has better thinset (glue for tiles) in their Flexbond.   So for me I shop at both depending on what I need and price point. I would say Lowes wins out more than HD. But HD has some items better. 
2582,"This is exactly right--the stores of both chains are incredibly inconsistent in customer service.  Go to which ever has better service.     I prefer the paint and tile at Lowes, and the lighting and plants at HD.     Also a shout out for local supply stores.  Some are very expensive, but if you hunt around you can usually find a couple that will beat anything at the big box or online.  Especially for plumbing, tile, etc. It's definitely worth making a few calls just to check prices."
2583,Home depot is more of a contractors store and Lowe's is more for your average home owner. They have more stylish options where home depot typically carries more construction grade items. When it comes to appliances I can't say much. I havent ever bought either from one of those two stores.   This may be just in my area. 
2584,It's like this here in Cleveland. Lowe's feels more like the yuppie store. Better prices available at Home Depot if you aren't as picky about style.
2585,Lowes market pitch when they entered was to be family/women friendly so makes sense.
2586,"I do a lot of work for a large vendor that sells to both Home Depot and Lowes. They tell me that Home Depot is specifically designed for contractors while Lowes is more designed for DIYers. The layout of the store is indicative of that, usually."
2587,"I've been saying this exact statement for years whenever this conversation comes up. Lowes seems more homeowner friendly, more stylish options. HD seems more contractor friendly. "
2588,"I've bought multiple appliances from lowes, because they have a price match plus 10 percent off deal.   Each time, I've found the appliance priced lower somewhere else and done the price match.   Then, when I go to the front to pay, I usually have a HD 10% coupon that they will match as well. (you can get these from setting up your move with the post office).   I end up with my appliance for price match plus 20% off."
2589,"Just for reference, Home Depot offers the same ""meet-and-beat"" price matching."
2590,And honors Lowes 20% off coupons. 
2591,How do you get Lowe's 20% off coupons?
2592,"Gotta love deals.  I got a brand new fridge from Lowes, regular $2600 for $1350 during the president's day sale.  You can buy a 10% off coupon on eBay for a couple bucks - that saved me $150 right there."
2593,"Lowes still had it originally listed 20% higher than the next most expensive place you found. So again, great deal you got but for anyone reading don't assume 40% off is really 40% off. "
2594,I need to buy a large appliance (range) from Lowe's. Can you PM the spreadsheet please?
2595,"Looks for a place called Appliance Smart.  Same part numbers as everyone else at MUCH lower prices.  We got our new set of kitchen appliances for 40% less than everyone else's sale prices.  No need to wait for holiday sales either.  Oh and free shipping and removal of the old appliances.  BTW: replacing the 20 year old electric appliances cut our electric bill in HALF!  Yes, over the same months..."
2596,"Now that Sears is basically out of business, where do you recommend?"
2597,"When Home Depot delivered my dishwasher, they didn't even want to take it out of the box for me.  When Lowes delivered my refrigerator, they unboxed it, peeled off all the protective plastic, and hooked up the water supply line."
2598,"Yup, Lowes delivery guys rock. They moved my old stove out to the garage and were extremely thankful I offered them a cold bottle of water."
2599,"I had the opposite experience. Lowe's delivered a gas grill, barely wanted to take it off the truck. Home Depot delivered a full set of new kitchen appliances and were willing to not only take them out, but also do the full water/drain/gas hookups even though I hadn't paid for them. One difference may be that Lowe's delivered in a Lowe's truck, but HD subcontracted out the delivery."
2600,"To be fair, basic hookup like water and electrical are usually included with the delivery. More complicated appliances like dishwashers or appliances with gas hookups are usually charged extra.  For Lowes, you need to contact the specific store and make an appointment for a subcontractor for another ~$70 or whatever they charge.   Whereas with Home Depot, you can checkout online and tack on installation with a $20 checkbox.  When I bought my Bosch dishwasher from Lowes, they gave me a generic power cord instead of the proper one I paid for & I had to run around to get an electrical fitting on top of that. "
2601,"I didn't pay the extra $30 for a water line, was just going to ""install"" the fridge myself after they delivered.  Lowes' delivery guys said they had an extra, and insisted on installing it for me.  They did an awesome job and were very careful and clean in my new house!"
2602,We were told Lowes no longer does this. We tried when we bought some power tools this weekend.
2603,I been using lowes 10% off but never heard of HD 10% off.  I prefer HD because it's near me and they always have plent of staffs and busier for a reason. While all lowes around here always dead on any given day. I do purchased few big buck stuff whenever there's 10-20 from lowes. And sometimes it's not really off since it's same price eles where after coupon
2604,So are you saying that lowes does a match and then beats it by 10%...? I just talked with them on the phone a few hours ago and got them to match a HD price and they didn't do the additional 10% drop. Will need to call them back if that's the case!
2605,"Lowes and Home Depot are literally across the street from each other where we live.  I usually opt for HD simply because I like orange more than blue, but I've been going to lowes more often lately for no apparent reason.  I now realize that I might be a little odd."
2606,I think prices at HD are a bit cheaper.
2607,"Home depot for rough materials, Lowes for finish work."
2608,"My HD has 2 guys I avoid like the plague, because they are so good. For more complicated projects these two usually have better ideas and when I need something they walk me right to it. I avoid them at first so I can wander around the store without feeling like I'm insulting them after I get everything I need. I want to wander without carrying everything"
2609,"The Lowes' in my area have absolutely awful customer service. I've had to make so many complaints. To me it seems like they don't pay shit, due to how much the employees don't give a crap."
2610,"Home Depot near me is typically cheaper than Lowe's on like products.  I used to go to Lowe's all the time but they got rid of their rental truck and they have no tool rentals in case I need something specific.  Home Depot has tool rental and truck rental.  I called the Lowe's GM about the truck.  He stated it wasn't profitable and I explained to him that it was a value added service.  They shouldn't be looking to profit on it, but at most break even.  The idea that they have the truck would encourage me to purchase from them.  I then said to him that if I wanted to get a large order I would have to pay their exorbitant $80 delivery fee.  He responded snarky and said ""It's $79"".  Definitely no reason to shop at Lowe's now."
2611,Their fee is out of control. HD charges 75 bucks but my local lumber yard only charges 40 bucks.
2612,"I know HD is a flat fee, so if you buy 10 pallets of pavers it will be the same fee as if it were 2. It's a good deal for bulk product but not so much otherwise."
2613,"This. I use Lowe's, Home Depot, & Menard's all regularly for different things and different sales. Lowe's site to store really sucks in my area, but you can buy those coupons on Ebay & get some major savings on big purchases."
2614,"Generally I prefer Home Depot. The one near me is better organized than it's corresponding Lowe's, plus they carry Makita and Milwaukee. Lowe's carries Bosch though so I go there sometimes for tools. I like Kobalt as a store brand better than Husky, so that's a point for Lowe's."
2615,"If you're looking for appliances, don't write off Best Buy, HH Gregg (a lot of stores went out of business and had crazy like 90% off discounts, not sure if those are still going), Sears (as long as you don't care about service since they're going out).  I would do research on what I want and who does it best to get the best product and then shop around to see where I can get the best deal. Leverage coupons, sales, memberships, all of it. We got a Lowe's credit card for the 5% off always thing (pay it off always) and sometimes they do bigger things too!"
2616,"HH Gregg still has the sales, but unless you're lucky and have one that they keep restocking, they're pretty bare."
2617,Home Depot.  It is 5 minutes away vs 25.
2618,Pretty much this (though more like 10 and 20).  Also HD is MUCH easier to get in and out of.  The area where the Lowes is ALWAYS has shitty traffic so it ends up taking even longer than that.
2619,"HD nearly all day long. I only have HD and Menards near me. HD is closer drive. There used to be a Lowe's but they closed down (and it was a 20 minute drive, now the closest is nearly 45 minutes)  HD seems to have more knowledgable people near me that actually go out of their way to ask if you need help, but aren't annoying about it. The Menards near me it's difficult to find even one associate without walking halfway across the store.  I bought studs from Menards one time and nearly every one was warped in the store. I sorted through at least 30 before setting on just 10. The 10 I got home had warped just laying flat on the floor after a few days.  I still have studs from HD from months ago that are just fine that have been through the late winter and humidity of the spring, A/C, etc. Sad part is there's a Menards Distro center on the other side of town, so shouldn't have any excuses for poor products or out of stock stuff (which is rampant at this Menards)  The screws from Menards suck, HD has those ""SPAX"" self pilot screws (WITH the bit!), those things I can buzz into the wood all day without drilling pilots. Very nice. "
2620,"The president of Menards is also a real piece of shit, so I avoid shopping there. Luckily, there's **always** a Home Depot or Lowe's directly across the street."
2621,"Menards does profit sharing with their employees, so I've always liked them a little more for that. "
2622,"HD does profit sharing as well, albeit not fantastic unless you're a department head or higher."
2623,"i usually just go to Lowes because it is closer to me and easier to get to.   I don't really have a particular favorite. They are both very close in prices and both offer similar products. I will usually price match if it's something I can't get online and/or is a high ticket item.   We bought our stove and microwave through Lowes and the process was fine, except they gave us the wrong model when they brought it up. Simple return process but we found out before we left the store.  Lowes does have more of a selection on the floor than Home Depot does, at least the stores I go to.   Home Depot has a great online order and pick up in store system. It's a lot easier than doing it at Lowes. But this is just my experience at the ones near me.   Personally, I wouldn't just pick one and stick with that store. Both may excel in certain areas and you can benefit from going to both. Also, for smaller things, check out Amazon. I was able to get a lot of stuff for our renovation through Amazon at a much cheaper price than the big box stores.   "
2624,"If I'm just going to grab some supplies, I almost always go to HD.  I just know the store setup better and feel like i can get in and out faster.  This is store specific, but I also think my local HD's ""pros"" are better than the Lowes across the street.  If I'm making a major purchase, like an appliance, I'll take time and shop both."
2625,I go to both.  Lowes has some things that I prefer while Home Depot has some other things I prefer.
2626,"I prefer HD because I know the store layout well and the checkout line moves fast.  My local Lowes is tricky to find stuff, and often related items won't be where you expect to find them. For example, a garbage disposal was in one aisle and the power cord was in a separate section of ""accessories.""   I'm sure if I spent more time at Lowes that would change, but I know the brands HD carries (like Cree LED bulbs, which I like) and HD is easier to get to, despite them being near each other."
2627,"Menards. 3 words, 11% rebate. "
2628,"(*)Rebate in the form of a Menard's ""gift card"".    Since you mentioned them, I'll pass this 4th-hand info along: My wife worked at one of the others and pretty much to a man the electrical contractors who came to her store told her (and anybody who asked) to NEVER EVER buy electrical equipment from Menards. Something about being cheaply made and shoddy and failing way too soon and in some cases being outright dangerous."
2629,"Hmm, good to know. Yeah the catch is its a gift card for Menards but they have so many other home items is not just lumber and kitchen sinks. If they had a real grocery section, we'd shop there exclusively, probably. Thanks for the heads up though. "
2630,"Don't forget Menards. There has been times I was needing something that I could not find at Lowes or Home Depot, but Menards carried it."
2631,Menards!
2632,Lowe's. Home Depot always restocks items onto the shelves that have previously been sold and are missing parts.
2633,"Last time I bought a washer I looked at reviews for a top rated one then price shopped. At the time Lowe's was the best price, but I felt no loyalty to them."
2634,"I was a manager for Home Depot some time ago. I still go to the one I worked the longest at. Not many employees left from when I worked there but it's nice to connect.  It depends on what I need and what the current policies are. For locks my local HD is charging to rekey while Lowes is not, so I buy locks at Lowes. Lowes decided they won't cut PT plywood so I buy that at Home Depot. I went to buy a washing machine on short notice, HD went to order only so I couldn't lock one up same day. I drove down the street and bought one at lowes.  In general Lowes is cleaner and more organized. They carry less sku's and have lower staffing to customer ratio. If you know what you want and they have it you'll get in and out Lowes faster than HD. Every once in a while I walk out of Lowes because they don't carry basic things you'd expect them to. For example they don't have Uni-strut,   HD carries more stuff and has more staff so tend to be better for specialty items."
2635,"Both. Lowe's has more interior trim, and typically better plumbing accessories. HD has better tools (Milwaukee, their house brand husky, etc ) and better rough carpentry materials. They're both about the same distance from my house, so I go to both depending on my needs.   Local farm store for fasteners. They put the big box bins to shame. "
2636,"I like the Depot better as an in-person store but god save you if you have to order something from them. They fucked pretty hard with me when I tried to get molding delivered. Couldn't order a certain molding from any other Depot or get it shipped in from a national Depot warehouse. And I had to call *them* to find out when they were going to deliver. I was bouncing around their phones like a pinball trying to get to the delivery department. Finally got 'em 3 calls later. Called again 4 PM day of, and only THEN did they tell me 6-8 PM. So I said fuck it, drove there and killed the order in person. My name was first on their delivery whiteboard, so presumably I'd be the day's first delivery. Between 6 and 8 PM. And I was the closest to the store.  Lowe's out-and-out told me the day and time of my delivery at order. And they came right on time.  Uncle is a vet and he gets a discount through Lowe's, but not the Depot. So if you're a military supporter you know where to go.  Also, Lowe's has a 10% mover's coupon if you change your address thru usps.com."
2637,"In my case, there is a lowes and HD a block away from each other.  I have been shopping at the 2 for over 10 years and I do quite a bit of home improvement projects.  I have primarily gone to HD because their customer service is hands down way way better than the lowes.  This could simply be a management issue at this particular lowes but over the years I have pretty much done all my shopping at home depot.  Every now and then I don't find exactly what I am looking for and head over to lowes to check and its a ghost town both in customers and customer service.  It is a nightmare trying to get any help there.  so every year home depot gets a couple thousand from me on average and lowes gets my bad reviews. "
2638,"Contractor suppliers. Both home despot and lows sells cheap knock off everything. I buy a plastic electrical box and my nice professional greenlee knockout took makes the box explode. Drill bits are 1/10th the quality and the same price as my professional supplier. Stainless hardware at my supplier is 1/5 (!) the cost of home despot.   The only exception is 2x4's. Locally anyways the contractors suppliers won't let you cherry pick the best wood, they just bring you the load."
2639,"In Canada, we have Rona, HD, and Lowes. Lowes just bought out Rona not too long ago and has been making Rona blow HD out of the water. Their customer service and products are amazing now. The lumber selection is Grade 2 or better at the same price as HD Grade 3. And Lowes and Rona have more than 2 carts with steering wheels. HD, Get you shit together. "
2640,"Home Depot.   Each time that I find myself in a Lowe's, I feel that my questions are either not answered correctly, or it requires the person that I asked to ask someone else.   At HD, the employees consistently know where everything I need is and how to help."
2641,"Home depot allows dogs so I usually went there, although for really quick trips Lowes was a little closer so I'd go there sometimes. I sold my house and moved now I only go to HD since there isn't a Lowes nearby. "
2642,"Home depot, it's closer and the employees are nicer. "
2643,"Depends on the store. Of the three nearby hd's, one is incredible for staff knowledge and availability, the other two are a complete disaster. Lowes has some nicer finish options, but their store network isn't laid out as conveniently for me. I also find their staff sort of suck in the nearby locations.  Hd seems to hire retired tradesmen and lowes seems to hire high school students."
2644,Yeah so explore the various stores!  We have 2 HD nearby and I love the staff in one and in the other all I get is crap. I got an employee giving me shit for asking him to move out of my way so I can get to the register. 
2645,"Lowe's for the 5% discount if you use their credit card.   I do think HD has a much superior tooling selection, as well as flooring."
2646,"For more builder materials, usually HD.  For more appliances, usually Lowes.  But depends on day and sale and I still check out Sears or other stores as well."
2647,"Where I live we have the 3rd option of Menards. It was around for decades before the other 2 and is still a great big box store. It's main difference is all bulk/large items are kept in the yard. So you pay for it and drive your vehicle back to load it up. This has 2 benefits. 1) you handle your items only once (not including unloading at your destination of course) 2) you can actually pay for items and pick them up when ever. I bought 70 bundles of shingles, 4 rolls of felt and some nails last weekend and l haven't picked them up yet and won't until it's time to do my roof.   Plus where I live they are all within 3 blocks of each other. Kind of cool to have so many choices."
2648,"Guys, don't forget about your local Ace Hardware for smaller stuff. "
2649,"Costco for appliances. They automatically add years to manufacturers warranty and their return policy generally is fantastic. Plus they carry models the manufacturer designates for Costco that usually have the higher end feature set for lower prices.  As far as hardware store, outside of choosing one over another because they carry different items, I choose on a store by store basis. Im three years deep into home ownership and I found that I the HD or Lowe's stores take on the personality of the GM. One Home Depot might have their shit together and hire employees that care and are helpful, might have great clearances prices and good stock while simultaneously another HD down the road is a compete shitshow. Same applies to Lowes.  Good luck. Oh and avoid their Credit Cards or at least avoid their inflated APR on their cards.   "
2650,"I always go with lowes. HQ is in my home state, and lowes fired my mother-in-law. I also only shop at Harris teeter, academy, harbor freight, staples because they fired her as well"
2651,"I have thought this for a while and actually just verbalized it for the first time to a friend last night; Lowes is to The Home Depot what Target is to Walmart. I shop at both of them regularly and even though Lowes is slightly more expensive, I would much rather shop there than The Home Depot. The only thing I do not like about Lowes is how they setup their hand tools in the front of the store but you have to walk through a maze to get in and out of that section. I'm sure they are doing this to prevent theft but it's a little overkill for me. "
2652,Lowes. For some reason Home Depot layouts just don't make any sense to me and it takes twice as long to find anything.
2653,"I use the Home Depot app, it tells you exactly in the store (aisle and shelf location) where each item is, and makes my trips there very efficient (read ""I don't buy extra stuff).  I do like Lowes also too "
2654,"If you can't tell your wife exactly which bay the fitting you forgot to pick up/broke during your repairs, then you have not done enough Home Improvement projects yet."
2655,"I can't find *anything* in HD's electrical department without staring for 20 minutes, and I *used to work* there.  But I sent someone who knows absolutely nothing about anything and who can barely use a computer an email with a link to a shallow-work electrical box on HD's website and they were able to find it immediately.  The system works."
2656,Mobile site also shows bay as well.  
2657,At our HD there's absolutely no cell signal whatsoever. I end up looking up everything on the app and texting it to myself or my wife before heading in. Otherwise it's a clown fiesta.  The app is seriously great.
2658,"They like to have 5 different areas for the same category.  Need a washer for your hose and sink, that's in two separate places..... Absurd.   Lowe's has it all in one spot. Lowe's price matches, Home Depot says they don't, not worth the fight to call corporate or show the manager their own site, which they don't want to look at cause it proves them wrong  "
2659,Menards
2660,"Lowes.  Because I know where everything is. It never fails, when I go to Home Depot, I leave pissed off because I couldn't find what i was looking for.   "
2661,"Lowe's is almost always cheaper for the same or equivalent,  so I go there"
2662,"Lowes.  Because it's closer to my house, which makes it nice when I need to make like 4 trips in one day.  I've also had really good experiences with customer service at my local Lowe's."
2663,Menards.
2664,"As others have mentioned, it varies from place to place... but I prefer HD for my raw materials (lumber, adhesives, fasteners, electrical supplies, etc.) and Lowes for my ""finishing touches"" (lighting, fixtures, appliances, etc.)."
2665,"We have both, one across from the other. The Lowe's is smaller then a typical one and not arranged like most Lowe's.    Every time I have walked in there (over a dozen times) they don't have what I need. Infuriating. I went in there in the dead of winter to buy a zone control. I needed three zones but I could get by with one. They literally do not carry any in the store. Single zone included. You've got to be kidding me. Depot had singles in stock. Talked to a employee, called around and found me a store which had them in stock. Verified and had them hold it for me.   I won't go into that Lowe's anymore. As others said thought - depends greatly upon the store."
2666,It depends 100% on the physical location.  Some are great some are terrible.  Where I live now it's Lowes.  When I lived 20 miles South it was the local Home Depot.
2667,"I prefer Lowes on tools and outdoor material, Home Depot on paint and lumber. "
2668,"In my town I have a Lowes directly across the street from a Home Depot.  I usually go to one, until for what ever reason, it pisses me off and then I go to the other, and I continue this cycle.  If both have ticked me off at the same time, I'll then go to Menards.  I don't really care for Menards, they seem overpriced..."
2669,"I bought a fixer-upper 18 months ago and we've done a ton of remodeling, so I feel like I'm required to answer this question. As stated, each individual store can vary considerably. The lowers closest to my house sucks for customer service, but the one 10 miles away is stellar. Lowe's tends to be cleaner and better laid out. However, Home Depot has a lot more options, especially online. I was very particular about the finishes I put in my house and was searching for a very specific ""look"" for each item. I was pretty disappointed with the selection at Lowe's in general. Home Depot fit the bill and had way more options for almost everything we needed (vanity, ceiling fans, etc).    Home Depot is farthest from me, so if I need a generic bolt, doorknob, etc and I need it quick I go to Lowes. If it's anything else I tend to go to Home Depot or order from Home Depot online."
2670,One thing to consider is checking out Best Buy as well.  I got a nice kitchen aide dishwarsher there on a Black Friday.  They matched HD's Black Friday price AND had a free delivery and installation deal of their own going on.  It ended up being nearly half regular price of everything.
2671,"They are a venn diagram with about 98% overlap. The non-overlapping stuff is pretty random and arbitrary as far as I can tell. So, personally, I check Lowe's first because they're a bit closer. Occasionally I need to go to HD to get something only they have."
2672,"a general rule of thumb for me (and there will always be exceptions) is that I use HD for materials, and Lowe's for more finished products.  "
2673,"I usually go to Home Depot, because it is much, much, much more conveniently located for me.  But if it is for something small or something that I need advice or have questions regarding, I go to our local Ace Hardware. It's just a couple blocks away so I can walk our dog there and she can visit with the dogs that ""live"" in the store.  The staff, even the young highschool kids, are all 10X more knowledgeable than anyone I have encountered at home depot or Lowes, and as such have helped me work through some issues, mostly plumbing problems related to our old house.   It is really beneficial being a local neighborhood shop, as they see customers who mostly have the same era and style of homes, so their knowledge is quite applicable usually.  I say go to whichever is more convenient for you or has a better deal, and then start going to your local hardware store for as much as you can. Big orange and big blue don't really appreciate your dollars like an Ace Hardware or other franchise/local operation will."
2674,Home Depot is 1.5 miles from my house.  Lowe's has to have something really special to get me to drive across town.
2675,I've found that Lowes staff know a lot less than Home Depot. When I say know less I mean something as general as knowing where something in the store is. Pricing there the same. Products Like Home Depot better. I used to prefer Lowes simple because it's closer to my house. Now I drive a bit further because I'd rather buy from Home Depot. 
2676,"Home Depot is from Mars, Lowe's is from Venus. "
2677,"I hate them both and prefer McLendons (nw chain), but I think Lowe's has disappointed me more than HD. I have left there empty handed so many times and felt deceived other times.   HD also sucks because (at least where I'm at) the stores are poorly managed and they change their suppliers too often.   Both places have great deals sometimes, especially on clearance appliances. "
2678,"My experience with Lowes last year upon closing was a nightmare. Same as you OP we needed a washer dryer and fridge on day one.   Ordered online and didn't receive word on anything for weeks until I called the local store myself. Took several different managers just to find the order and at that time I was informed that I wasn't contacted because they were still ""waiting on the washer.""  Anyways, it was the wrong unit and long story and several deliveries later and I got sense of it all.   In the end there was absolutely *zero* benefit to opening up a Lowe's line of credit as the 0% APR in house financing is no better than what you could get opening up a line with your current bank. At the end of the Lowes term it goes up to 24%!   That said I ended up transferring the balance to a Bank Of America card anyways so I'm just trying to save you the trouble.   Open a credit card and shop at whichever store you want."
2679,Home depot. 1.5 miles from my home. I can go there and back super fast. 
2680,Here is a helpful site for Washer/Dryers http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-washer-and-dryer/  HD for building materials and Lowes for gardening stuff. Also look for sales on stuff like Duraflame logs and Bounty Towels. These two products will be on sale between the two stores multiple times a year.  Finally good luck on the new home and all Chimney Repairmen are crooks.
2681,"Lowes for plumbing as its far superior,  HD for everything else.  Really though unless I am doing some big plumbing jobs I got to whoever is closer. "
2682,"The people at my local HD are generally more knowledgeable and friendly. The product quality and selection at Lowes is better than HD.  Solution? Go talk to the folks at HD with questions, have them tell me what I need, then go buy it at Lowes."
2683,"Definitely get all your appliances from Sears and Sears Outlet stores. You can save a ton of money buying scratch and dent stuff, plus a lot of the stuff will come with factory warranties.  As far as Home Depot vs. Lowe's I go to Lowe's because the CEO of Home Depot is a huge douchebag. The CEO of Lowe's might also be a douchebag, I don't know, but I know for a fact the Home Depot guy is a sexist, bigot, etc. "
2684,"Depends on what I'm buying. My Lowe's usually has better dimensional lumber like 2x4s... I don't have to search to find one. And I like kobalt over husky. But I like Ridgid power tools and that's a home Depot thing. My home Depot also has better stocked and organized electrical and plumbing departments. Home Depot has a hobby lumber department with oak boards and such, but my Lowe's doesn't. The paint is comparable at both. So it's a toss up and depends on what I'm buying.   But I use true value for nuts and bolts... So much better than either"
2685,">  The paint is comparable at both.  I have found Lowes/Sherwin-Williams partnership brand FAR superior to the reformulated HD Behr Paint.  Behr used to be terrific paint, but HD ruined it."
2686,"I just did the whole house in Behr Premium Plus Paint+Primer. Coverage was great, real pleasure to work with. I'm talking valspar vs. behr. The Sherwin-Williams is a whole other price point. "
2687,"Home Depot, for 2 reasons:  1. Employees are way nicer, happier, and more knowledgeable  2. My car was keyed at Lowe's "
2688,"Home Depot usually gets the first nod from me because they're less than a mile away. Their garden section is pretty nice and their tool section is much more organized.   Lowe's, on the other hand, is my go to place for price matching appliances, seasonal items and LED bulbs. I know they're not the best quality, but they have two-packs of 60w equivalent for $1.50."
2689,"I mostly use Lowes, if you have their credit card you get 5% off at the register and they are closer to my house, although I drive by both on my way home from work.  If I'm working on a bigger project I'll compare both based on price and what fixtures/finishes I like more.  Most projects end up being a combination of both as well as a few other sources.    I used to use Menards mostly but prices got higher, and service got terrible. "
2690,"I mostly stopped shopping at HD about 20 years ago.  Wife and I needed an over-the-range microwave. Went into HD, looked at all the displays, and found one we liked for like $225. Told the clerk we would take that one and he says it has to be ordered. I said fine, we weren't in a hurry. That is when he tells us there is a $75 delivery charge. I said that shipping to the store was fine, but he said the charge would be the same either way.  So, frustrated and not willing to pay an extra 33%... we ask which ones don't have to be shipped. He walks off to his terminal and looks around for 20 minutes only to come back and tell us that all of them do.   So despite having an entire bank of displays, they don't have a single one they can sell without a $75 extra charge. We complained to the mgr to no avail and ended by telling them to fuck off.  We drove across the street to Lowes, picked one out. Clerk pulled it for us and loaded it right into our car.  I know it won't break them, but I would guess that $75 has cost them about $60k in the years since then (we do a lot of house work)."
2691,"Lowe's for me. Girlfriend works at Lowe's corporate, so any mention of the orange store is heresy. And I'm a veteran, and they give 10% off up to $500 per day for all active or prior military.   I used to be a home depot guy, but the home depots here in Charlotte, especially up in concord where I live, are pretty shit since we're like 20 minutes away from Lowe's corporate. "
2692,Lowe's has fucked me over on a few occasions with very simple customer service scenarios. Home Depot always treats me well. I avoid Lowe's at all costs
2693,Lowes only because of the $15 off $50 promo codes. PM me if you need some. 
2694,"It depends on what Im getting. We bought our appliances at lowes but buy lumber at HD due to proximity and a lack of local yards. I shop the sales, though, and see no sense in megastore loyalty. "
2695,i'm more of a craft person but my SO has construction experience. lowes seems to be more homeowner friendly where as HD tends to be more contractor friendly. both are good but we usually end up at lowes. some brands are better at HD depending on what you need 
2696,"Lowes.  Home Depot always has shit in the aisles.  Ladders, buckets of bullshit, gadgets I dont need, metal carts that should be in aisle 34, and that old guy that doesn't want to spring for the LED bulb."
2697,Lowes. Every HD near me restocks returned items without verifying all the parts are in the box. I've been screwed on everything from locks to ceiling fans to a god damn toilet.
2698,"In Alberta, Canada, my experience has been in favour of Home Depot. The staff is better trained/more experienced, and more attentive. Although Lowes has the price match +10%, they are very picky about giving it out, and it takes them half an hour to decide each time if they'll honour it. Although, one thing I want has been out of stock for months, and I see it's at Lowes in spades though."
2699,Home Depot for their customer service. I have had some really bad experiences with Lowes folks. 
2700,"It's going to be a mix of both.  Overall, I find lighting to be better at Lowes than at HD.  Lumber is hit and miss depending upon the location"
2701,"Home depot has much better service and a superior website but lowes is closer so I buy there more often. Lowes staff is consistently shitty so in a way, they always live up to my expectations."
2702,"I have a Lowes and a Home Depot within a mile of each other, so I tend to go to both...but to be honest, I always to go HD first.  I couldn't say why, I just do.  My dog seems to like HD more."
2703,Lowes. You can buy coupons on ebay. Home depot not so much.  
2704,"Don't get me wrong, I like Lowe's, they have certain advantages over Home Depot. Their staff is around to help more than HD, and they have a lot more stylish fans and lamps than HD (in my own opinion)  Where I lean towards Home Depot is 2 things - credit and contractors.  Home Depot credit card (Citibank) seems to understand that if you're looking for a home improvement card you need a large credit limit. I've done some larger jobs with Home Depot that we're 15k+ and HD Citibank had no issue extending my credit line to 30k so my credit line doesn't look like I maxed the card out (and hoping I spend 30k ;))   Also, 24 months interest free is a good deal for large projects since I always pay it off before interest gets accrued.  Lowe's credit (Synchrony bank) maxed me out at 8k credit limit, and refused to extend even though my income and credit scores allowed for 30+k credit limits elsewhere. They do no interest or 5% off the order, but that means nothing if you can't do a large project on it.  Finally, there is contractors. I've only had flooring installed from both companies. HD assigned it to a specific contractor, which were amazing. Showed up on time every day, got the job done right, same crew every day. No bullshit.  Lowe's had 3 contractors show up at my house in the 3 days the job was going on, each not sharing what they did the previous day so I had to re-explain certain things about the job multiple times. Was not pleased with that at all.  "
2705,"I like Lowes more, but I live equidistant between the two. Home projects usually take a few trips to the hardware store, so I alternate. "
2706,Home Depot. It's closer to my house by 2 miles. And I'm just so familiar with the layout I can navigate that place really quick.  Their prices are so similar it's almost like Coke and Pepsi. Pick one and stick with it.       Worth mentioning: most of the stuff they sell at either place is pretty crappy quality. If you want nice stuff go to places that specialize in it. Lumber / trim / doors: go to a lumberyard. Plumbing fixtures: plumbing supplier. Lighting: chandelier store. Etc. you get the idea. These options cost more but you get what you pay for.      If you have to build something that you want nice and square for gods sake don't by 2x4s at HD or Lowes. 
2707,"As an IT contractor I can tell you that Lowes is in a constant struggle to match what HD is doing. As such I tend to only shop at HD. Much like I prefer Mac over HP PC's.  HD seems to have the better leadership and I tend to trust their quality of products. That said HD sells Ryobi products which are complete crap.  I go to Harbor Freight for 1 off tools. I apply the same philosophy to HD vs. Lowes. If I need good product; HD, if I need weather stripping or some stone, Lowes; something they can't mess up. "
2708,"it's kind of like target vs. walmart (I defer to target a lot but I visit *both*.. I like walmart's saving catcher)  walmart/home depot is always the cheapest.. (sort of) but regardless of higher prices.. lowes there's some hidden values to lowes that I Don't care to elaborate on.. (I'd love to tell you about all the free/hidden value I got from lowes but I can't.. ""information is power"" n' all that that and also because of this.. I've gotten some bad customer service on a few occasions.. but you take the good with the bad..cause it's **90%** *good*) it'd be nice if any store would have these ""new app"" controlled motorized blinds that are supposed to be available but there not yet.  menards is pretty neat.. they just opened 3-4 stores here..but they're all still too far away...  Also when it comes to nearest home depot or lowes.. basically lowes is closer and faster to me to get too.. they are on the highway.. and HD is farther or in the middle of the inner city meaning ""no highway"" access.."
2709,"I can't speak for all Lowe's locations, but the one local to me in Pittsburgh is my go to if I'm doing a project that I've never tackled before. The folks they have there walk me through without having me spend a ton of extra money.   If it's a project I've done before and know what I need, I hit my local Home Depot. I'm a huge DIY-er, so I know my way around both stores. "
2710,Lowes because there are few employees to bother me and I know what I want and where it is. 
2711,"In Colorado, there seems to be a big difference in the number of employees on the floor helping customers. In Home Depot, I get people asking me if they can help me find something, which is awesome. At Lowes, I literally (yes, literally) have to sometimes walk through the entire store to find the one damn person that I can ask a question of, but of course there's already 4 other people there waiting to ask them a question."
2712,For appliances Lowes or Sears For everything else Menards
2713,"I usually shop at Home Depot as it's closer to my house, doesn't require me to travel on a highway to get there, and has probably 90% of what I need.  I shop at Lowe's when Home Depot doesn't have what I need. Most recently this meant baseboard heater covers, but it also usually means decorative stuff; Lowe's typically has a more upscale selection of ceiling fans, lights, cabinet hardware, etc.  IMO, Lowe's is better, or at least more logically, organized. More than once have I gone to Home Depot to look for something which *obviously* should be in (for example) the hardware aisle, only to discover that, no, it's actually in the aisle with the mailboxes, or with the doors, or whatever. I almost never get that when I go to Lowe's; more often than not when I expect to find something in a certain aisle at Lowe's, it's right where I expect it to be."
2714,"My list of preference for stores.    1.  Harbor Freight for disposables, one-off items, most hand tools unless I'm going HIGH end.  (Their stuff is about Stanley grade, sometimes better.  But it's substantially below pro level).   2. Menards except for plumbing.    3. Ace for Hardware (and strangely they have the best Christmas lights, even better than Target).  4. An actual lumber yard for any furniture grade lumber.  5. An actual plumber's supply store for plumbing.  6. Amazon.com (nice tools, some hard to find items)  7. Home Depot or Lowes, whichever actually has the items I need. Like, strangely, Home Depot HQ refuses to stock rounded baseboard molding caps, even though every house in the region is made with rounded corners (adobe looking style southwestern houses).  Even the Home Depot staff are upset about that...  For appliances, you should try and wait until September when they're 40-50% off.  Appliances have an insane markup (about 70%) and are built like garbage these days (last about 7 years).  "
2715,"I second this. If you actually need to talk to someone who has at least the slightest knowledge about hardware store stuff, Ace is 100x better than big box. At mine they actively greet everyone who enters and ask what they can help with. I’m usually in and out of there in a fraction of the time vs. HD wandering all over the place either trying to find stuff or trying to find someone who is willing to help me with a question."
2716,The HD or Lowe’s app is great for reducing the wandering around time.
2717,Yeah I thought this was supposed to be how you shop at Home Depot?
2718,"Yeah, this is what my plumber said too.  If you can fix it, home depot.  If you need help, ACE is better."
2719,"Ok I thought it was just me, but it's almost impossible to get an employees help at HD or Lowes, and even when you do, you get the feeling that they are just waiting for the convo to end because they are so busy!  Local shops may be the best option"
2720,I love my ACE!
2721,"I always check Ace Hardware first, I have been an Ace fan for many years and always go there, they always treat me right and have time to answer my questions."
2722,"I agree with this so much. my local ace is great.   Also on another topic with my local ace, they stock a specific local lawn care product line. A few times a year they have a rep from the company come and  answer questions. It's awesome."
2723,Ace also fixes screen windows on the cheaper side. That and key cutting are their best services.
2724,"Home Depot. I'm in between a Lowe's and a home Depot but I find home Depot has a better selection. Not sure if you're near an Ace Hardware, but we have them where I live. The people there are nice but the prices can be significantly more than home Depot for the same thing."
2725,I never find what I’m looking for in HD. They always have the more expensive version of what I’m looking for.   It pisses me off. For this reason alone I stopped going to HD.
2726,Lowes and for tools Harbor Freight (except battery tools)
2727,"As a homeowner, and also a contractor, Home Depot. I find myself constantly frustrated at Lowes because they always seem to be out of stock on very basic, very common items (mostly electrical and plumbing fittings), and their online inventory is hit or miss.  Ace/True Value can be good for oddball fasteners and hardware, but their prices are usually significantly higher on most items.  A supply house or lumber yard can be the best bet depending on what you're doing. Higher quality materials and generally knowledgeable employees at a slightly higher cost."
2728,"Home Depot, I've always liked their selection. Lumber sucks but I do like their other stuff."
2729,Near me it’s the opposite. Home Depot has far better plywood sheet options than Lowe’s for cheaper.  2x wood is about the same quality and price at both.
2730,"Ace for little things, Lowe’s for big things. Sometimes Menards. Home Depot only as a last resort because 1) it is hardest to get to despite being closer than Menards and 2) getting anyone to help requires an act of God."
2731,"Binford.  but in all seriousness, I try to follow pricing and focus on brand of what I'm getting > brand of store."
2732,"I live very close to an ACE hardware. I LOVE my local ACE, and they’re very helpful, knowledgeable, and have great customer service.  I wish I could get everything I need at Ace, but their stock is limited and sometimes too specific for what I am looking for.   My local Lowe’s is great for the gardening section. My local Home Depot is great for anything else that Ace doesn’t have."
2733,"Home Depot for replacements (Appliances, lighting, faucets, carpeting, etc).  Ace for repairs, service (screens) and paint (Clark-Kensington)."
2734,"We go to Lowe's, probably only because they are closest to our house. And also they have a military/ veteran's discount everyday."
2735,"Got it, yes Lowe’s had some nice flooring when I visited the other week. Still think I will go with an online retailer since I loved the samples they sent me, but Lowe’s had a really good selection."
2736,I use Lowe’s over Home Depot because of the app for the military discount. HD offers it revert day here too but you have to prove it every time. Lowe’s just scans my phone and boom!  Discount.
2737,Lowes also sells open box or discounted items. HD doesn't do that unless they've changed the policy recently.
2738,"Grainger, hands down.  Since they’ve stopped only selling wholesale, I’ve gotten so much stuff there.  Their catalogue is huge and turnaround on orders is quick."
2739,"If you're going to Grainger, check out McMaster Carr. Get your costs back down and their delivery time is incredible."
2740,Lowe's for plumbing parts and lights.  Home depot for pretty much everything else. I prefer hd paint by a large margin as well as their electrical. I also like ace hardware a lot. If it matters I've been shopping in one of those stores a minimum of once a week for the last 20 years.
2741,"I go to the nearby Ace for most things. There is a Sutherlands around he corner from that if they don’t have what I need.  For carpentry/building/ larger projects, we have a Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menards all within a mile of each other. So whichever one’s website says they have what I need for the price.   Harbor Freight for many tools and odd hardware.   Oh and the local farm supply for some things.  Wow, I go to a lot of different places. Mostly Ace."
2742,Home depot. My wonderful girlfriend prefers Lowe's. One day it will end our relationship.
2743,"Are you serious? I mean I was kidding but, are you serious?!? Are you team home depot because that's the solution right there. Dump him for being Lowe's."
2744,"Sorry I'm on your girl's team, man. LOWE'S FOREVER!"
2745,I mean I'm willing to listen to your position. Bu you should be prepared to not win this one. I'm quite loyal to Lowe's.
2746,"Lowe's, I worked for Home Depot for a summer before quitting and taking a better job elsewhere and it was probably one of my top 3 worst places to have ever been employed, literally was written up for failing to have a positive enough attitude because and I'm quoting verbatim here "" I didn't smile enough "" I started job hunting immediately after that first one and it was such a pleasure to give them one shifts notice ( that's their own policy you only have to give a minimum of one shifts notice) that I was quitting."
2747,"I work for a Home Depot DC,  and it's one of the best jobs I've had. You probably had a shitty GM."
2748,"None of that has anything to do with the products they offer.  I'm sorry you had a bad employment experience there, but that doesn't answer the question asked in any way.  To OP: I find that Home Depot has a better selection.  In my experience, prices between the two are basically equal, so you're going going to save much by choosing one over the other.  I would just go with the one that carries more of what I'm looking for."
2749,"Dunn Lumber for quality wood. Ace for small items I need right away since it's closest to me and locally owned-ish. HD for whenever I want more options, plus it's generally cheaper the the two mentioned before. Lowe's if they have a specific on sale or the HD is too busy. Harbor Freight for super simple tools for the lowest price available."
2750,"Lowe’s, Ace, and local lumber mill."
2751,"Lowe's. I live in a smallish town outside of a larger city. Lowe's is the only home improvement store in town. There's a Menards about 15 minutes down the road on the outskirts of the larger city but it's a fucking hassle to find anything there. Even using their app to find a single specific item and clicking on the maps the thing is like ""well that item could be in one of these eight places around the store."" Really? I just redid my master bathroom and got maybe 3 small things there I couldn't find at Lowe's. Their vanity selection was actually pretty poor (everything was super expensive and I couldn't find any major quality differences from the ones at Lowe's). Home depot is a half hour away in the middle of the city and I'm not dealing with traffic and an hour commute unless I need something today that Lowe's and menards both don't have. I don't even try going to Ace. It's in the middle of the city right near a massive Bass Pro and I'm down to deal with that shit less than Home Depot."
2752,"Home Depot for most general things like bolts, screws, cheap tile, etc. I go to True Value or the lumber yard near my house for wood & tools because of the quality & knowledge of the staff and the fact that both are locally owned is awesome too"
2753,I go to Lowe’s but only because they are the closest to me and they give a military discount.
2754,Ace Hardware. I don't know anything and find the huge stores overwhelming. A smaller store with more personalized service and knowledgeable associates is exactly what I need when buying stuff for a project. Everything I've done in our house is the first time I've ever done it.
2755,Lowes. They have a wider variety of bath fixtures and most other upgrades. YMMV. Home depot has way better plants and outdoor improvements.
2756,"In the past, I used Amazon.  I would just plug in what I needed, and go for their top-seller.  This is good for new cash-strapped homeowners, but it’s usually a cheaper-quality item.  Now, I use consumer reports to find the item I want, and then I use price comparison sites to search for the best price."
2757,"Lowe's, our local store allows animals on leashes. My well behaved German Shepherd and I have spent some quality bonding time there"
2758,"Lowes, always"
2759,Menards
2760,I loved menards. Until I found out how terrible their owner was and I won’t return
2761,Ames got a Menards last year and I haven’t been in Lowe’s since.
2762,Tbf that Lowe's has always sorta sucked. It's small and always seemed to be out of stock of the one thing you went there for in the first place
2763,"I prefer my local shop, Harville Hardware, if I'm looking to buy a quality piece of equipment. If I need something for a quick repair, ACE Hardware. If I need general construction stuff that ACE doesn't carry, Home Depot. If I'm looking for finish grade stuff, Lowes."
2764,I'm partial to home depot for most things.  Lowes seemed to have a better selection of lighting.  Flooring came from a flooring liquidation store.
2765,I like McLendon's hardware rather than Home Depot because the staff in each area actually know their stuff and are very helpful even with my terrible descriptions and photos of things. They are also kind and patient. It's like an old school hardware store.
2766,"I'm not a fan of Lowe's, but it's less than a mile from home. 2 traffic lights and I have what I need.  The lumber is almost always warped and knotty (I think it sits outside, I've got wood off the shelf and it's been wet or frozen depending on time if year). If I need something nice or quality, I'll make the half hour drive to home Depot. It's one of the big ones, everything is always in stock and the lumber is decent, I think they store theirs indoors before it hits the shelves."
2767,"I don't have just one.  Walmart, Amazon, and Home Depot are where I end up getting most things.  I like to shop around and get the best deal between them.  Sometime I'll even do a mix of them for a project. Home Depots curbside pickup and Walmart's similar program are just so efficient lately as I don't want to be wandering around a store where over 50% of people aren't using masks.  I used to use Ace Hardware, but their pricing, selection, and staff just aren't what they used to be 10+ years ago.  I'm sure this varies from area to area though.  Ace also has a really poor online site that's totally unreliable and they've set me back a few times not having things a week after they were supposed to have them.    I have an aunt who loves Wayfair and boasts about how she gets lots of free items (they send a replacement and she gets to keep the defective version), but she also spends large amounts of time arguing with customer service.  My takeaway is that Wayfair can be great if you are willing to deal with customer service, but if you dread it like me might be a site to avoid."
2768,"I once heard on reddit “Home Depot to build a home, Lowe’s to finish a home”. I find this to be very true. Home Depot has all the functional bits all the time. Lowe’s however has much better choices when it comes to the aesthetics, their lighting aisle for example blows HD out of the water."
2769,"Wow I’m going to remember this, thanks! Makes sense as to why Lowe’s had superior flooring options imo"
2770,Menards
2771,"Ace. They are 5 minutes fromMy house vs 15 for the big box stores.  Plus there's always someone to ask and the store is small, I don't spend a long time wandering. Selection isn't as great as the big box but I'll support them to keep em open and close by"
2772,"Lowes for slightly lower prices when quality doesn't matter, Ace when I want the good stuff and advice from people who know what they're talking about. I'll avaid Home Depot as much as I can."
2773,"Menards requires masks. Until COVID has a vaccine, it's the place for me."
2774,"Well in the south there’s only two places to go, Lowe’s and Home Depot and both kinda suck. Once I went to a place called Menards up north and that’s how I found out you can actually buy wood that’s not pine. Didn’t even know you could do that. All this time I thought you had to mill your own hardwood. But then again the south sucks for everything so not surprised"
2775,"I used Home Depot, Lowes, HD Supply, Build.com, Ashley furniture, Costco, Ace Hardware, Walmart, Target, and Macy's.   Build.com has excellent phone support. I got my two chandeliers, and all my cabinets handles and pulls there with free shipping.  Macy's has a wonderful furniture sale annually.   Good luck."
2776,"Luckily I have Menards and Lowes 15 minutes away.  BTW Lowes will honor Menards 11% off sales, so will Home Depot.  For little stuff, I go to a Farm and Fleet, 3 minutes away.   Other times I will order off of Amazon if the pricing is better."
2777,"Im surprised menards is not a preferred store for everyone. Menards has better pricing than Home Depot and Lowe’s and better selections. I go to HD because i have one really close but if i need a better selection, always menards.   I have to start experiencing ace hardware more but don’t have one too close. And Lowe’s is overpriced and far!"
2778,"[Knowing that Home Depot supports the reelection of Donald Trump, I don't spend a dime there.](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740173176/home-depot-responds-to-calls-for-boycott-over-co-founders-support-for-trump)"
2779,We always go with Lowe’s. Husband gets a military discount there.
2780,"I'm currently boycotting my local Lowe's since they mismanaged the installation of a replacement front door and garage door and delayed it by several months. It was about 2 years ago and I'm still salty.  Going to Home Depot instead is easy since they're typically across the street from Lowe's anyway, at least around here."
2781,"Hd, never like Lowe’s or ace"
2782,Menards is my number one for most things. Ace is a second since they are usually closer.
2783,"Much of the time I go to my Lowe’s they are out of stock of the same items they have been out of stock for the last 8 months. (Like, do they ever take inventory?) Also the lumber is crap there, it’s like they never cull any of the picked through crappy lumber and just hope some unexpecting person will eventually buy it. At Home Depot I find what I need generally and the lumber is much better."
2784,Victoria’s Secret
2785,"Exactly. My Lowe’s by me has terrible customer service, which stinks because they are so much closer than Home Depot"
2786,"I used to work for Lowe’s for 10 years till this past January as a millwork specialist. Lowe’s does not care who they hire. I can swear to you the only hire people to fill in for coverage. You might have a few good full timers but half the departments will be empty staffed or being covered by a kid who’s in lumber and also covering millwork and hardware at the same time, who’s being payed probably 12-13$ a hour."
2787,"I normally go to Lowes, but I might start going to Home Depot, even though I realize this may have happened at both. Lowes shows that they have fireplace screens available in store and the number and items increased in a few days. I ordered one because  the second we're not looking, my puppy is running and jumping into the fireplace and trying to eat the fire stones and fake gas wood. The outside of the fireplace has granite on the bottom, so if I use a baby gate and he knocks it over, it might damage the granite. If I use cardboard, he'll destroy it or just move it.   So I ordered one online and selected pickup order. I get there, and ask who can help me, and they literally tell me they can't because it's a seasonal item. They also want $20 to ship it.   I normally prefer to go to that Lowes, because if I go to the slightly farther away Home Depot, there's usually people out there begging for money."
2788,"This is my exact situation. I literally drive past Lowe’s on my way to Home Depot. Every now and again I just stop at Lowe’s for convenience, but I almost always regret the decision, and half the time wind up at Home Depot eventually anyways."
2789,"Huh, that's the opposite for me. It's like pulling teeth trying to speak to the right department employee at home depot but everytime we go to Lowe's, employees are always asking if you need help and have never had issues. Definitely location dependent."
2790,Ditto. Lowe's is more convenient and there's always employees around. In fact I was looking for the right lightbulb for a low key photo project and started talking to an employee about it after he asked. I then had to figure out how to end our 20min discussion of color temperature and Kelvin ratings cuz I had to pee. He was very enthusiastic. 9/10 customer service only because at a certain point he should have cared less.
2791,"I don't doubt that.   The manager of the Home Depot store near me does a great job running his store, while Lowes seems like they just hired kids away from McDonald's, who have never held a hammer in their life. It's usually a waste of time for me to ask for help at my Lowe's store."
2792,"Same! We have several home improvement projects going on and go to Lowe's right up the street often, but with more time on hand we've been making the 20 min. trip to HD because it's so much better. At Lowe's last week I heard a customer ask an employee, ""Excuse me, do you know where the [insert items] are?"" The guy just said, ""No, I don't"" without slowing down or offering to look it up. Surprised there was even an employee to be seen other than the check-out folks...anyway."
2793,I must be lucky. Where i live lowes and home depot are 30 minutes from my house and they are literally right across the street from each other. Ive gotten good and bad service from both though so now I go to the one thats gonna have the brand im looking for.
2794,"Wait, there's a Lowe's in existence that doesn't have a Home Depot across the street?"
2795,Mine doesn't. No Home Depot in my city.
2796,You would think. But how come Trader Joe’s and chick fil a consistently have great people across all the locations nationwide? Seriously I don’t know how but there has to be some aspect of Managment that influences this more than the other company
2797,"Those two companies seem to treat their employees really well and pay better than most.  Trader Joe's has minuscule turnover rates....to work in a grocery store.  I know someone that left a decent career to go work for one with eyes on management in the future.  I don't know about CFA, but a local chain, In&Out  Burger has a similar thing with employees.  Pay them above normal, good/great benefits, and they can pick and choose who they hire."
2798,"I think lowes is getting closer to that then depot. The 4 lowes in my county are consistent, while the depots are falling off. I used to see them equal but lowes is pulling ahead."
2799,"I had to get a new sliding screen door yesterday. I went to HD first because it's closer. The screen doors they had in stock were all broken and out of the packaging. I went to lowes and they were all new and unbroken. I couldn't find anyone at HD to help me but I found someone in Lowes in the door section. I normally like HD better for the types of things I buy but you're right HD is starting to fall off at least in my area. I have 2 HD's close to me. One of them I won't go to after a bad experience and the ""good"" one is starting to get bad.   The one I won't go to I bought a water heater from and when I got home and opened the box it was a used hot water heater all rusted and falling apart. Someone had returned it and they never checked the box. So I had to lug it all the way back and get another brand I didn't really want but it was all they had."
2800,"I go to Home Depot for building materials and Lowe’s for fixtures. HD has typically better selection of building materials, but Lowe’s has more on trend decorative items like light fixtures, planters, etc."
2801,My exact feelings. Lowes went hard on their HGTV partnership.
2802,How is the Lowe's Sherwin Williams hgtv paint?
2803,"Agreed. My dad is a builder and only goes to Home Depot, because they always have exact kind of materials he wants. I am *not* a builder, and I usually like Lowe’s because the things they sell are closer to finished products than materials."
2804,This was going to be my comment. HD for building and Lowe's or specialty for finishes.
2805,"I agree. Lowe’s is great for faucets, lighting, doorknobs, etc. More displays, broader products, and the like.   HD is better for when I’m actually building stuff, framing, roofing, etc.  In the pandemic world, however, I feel safer at Lowe’s, given their cleaning protocols, although their huge in-store only sale a week or so into this seemed a little ignorant of the moment’s severity."
2806,"If anything with the pandemic I prefer Home Depot. They actually limit how many people are in the stores and the last couple times I’ve ran to Lowe’s I couldn’t even find a parking spot. I prefer Lowe’s for almost everything, lumber I’ll get at an actual lumber yard tho because both stores tend to have crap lumber"
2807,"Man, we've been going to Lowe's because even without occupant limiting it's empty.  Oddly for us, the Depot has a better selection of everything, but if I can't find something there there's a good chance Lowe's has it. It's like Lowe's looked at Home Depot's inventory and said ""stock all the normal stuff, and then stock all the slightly-off sizes of everything that Home Depot doesn't have."""
2808,"Fair enough. I do appreciate that HD throttles traffic into stores, which Lowe’s doesn’t.  Debating ‘Top Places to Shop During a Global Pandemic’ isn’t what I expected for the year.   But, local everything, lumber yards (you’re right they’re better), and anything that helps people around me stay employed. I’m lucky to be, still."
2809,">Lowe’s has more on trend decorative items like light fixtures  Hey, you can't beat Menards large selection of what can only be described as mobile home lightning from the 1980s."
2810,Can add to this...all base materials bought at HD or Menard's...finishing fixtures at Lowes. But generally the Lowes by me is a wasteland.
2811,"Agree. I prefer my Lowe’s to Hd because it’s less crowded and cleaner with a better staff, but that’s just the case for my neighborhood."
2812,"Also, Home Depot > Lowe's for tools. With a few rare exceptions. But Lowe's > Home Depot for outdoor furniture."
2813,"Same here.  HD carries maple lumber and generally better kiln dried dimensional lumber.  I found that they have a better selection of tools.  Lowes carries a lot of designer lightning fixtures, ceiling fans, and faucets.  Also found that they carry better paint supplies and accessories."
2814,"HD loaned me $1k in materials for my eagle scout project after Lowe's laughed at me. 10 years later, I enjoy spending my shittons of money at HD now.  Edit: gifted $1k in materials."
2815,"Thank you! I couldn't have done it without a lot of help and direction from wiser adults who helped guide me through the process.   I do think the coolest thing here is that home Depot invested in a project that would help their community, and also gain a loyal customer for life. Interestingly enough, I just bought my first home last year and it happened to be right next to the very same home Depot that helped me. It's equidistant to the nearest Lowe's, but I still to this day feel almost obligated, in a good way, to support HD. It feels good to do all my diy shopping there during social distancing."
2816,"Our local HD gave my son a discount for his Eagle scout project as well, and IIRC, Lowe's would not, so that may be a corporate thing."
2817,"Mine gave me something like 15% off ten years ago. They also allowed me buy a whole pallet of quikrete (56 bags at 80lbs per bag!) at the contractor rate, and then let me return the unused bags."
2818,"Our Lowe’s just donated a ton of gardening tools, irrigation supplies, and other stuff to the local police department for them to build a community garden. This is possibly more about the individual stores than corporate level policies."
2819,I always find myself leaving Lowe’s and going to HD because they have more
2820,"Also, this is a nitpick, but when using the app in-store in Lowes, where the app tells you an item is located, like aisle and bay, it's usually totally inaccurate and I spend an extra 5 minutes looking or flagging an employee.  Home Depot app is always spot on when using it in-store."
2821,100% HD got it down. Also prefer their in house brands vs lowes. I love all the Husky stuff in general.
2822,"If you're buying things like actual hardware, HD has a much better selection, particularly metric. It's nowhere near as good as Ace/True Value type hardware stores of course, but it's certainly better stocked than Lowe's is in that regard."
2823,"That too is the complete opposite in my area, Lowes is the only place with a decent metric selection and the only ones with automotive grade shear resistant bolts"
2824,My lowes is better for appliances and lighting but nothing else. HD got them beat for general hardware and anything else.
2825,"I always find myself leaving Lowe's and going to HD because our Lowe's is run and operated by idiots, who don't know how to do their work,  constantly screw up, and also don't care about a customer a single bit."
2826,This. Lowes has the worst customer service ever
2827,Yep. I had a couple of guys in the lumber department talk down to me (female building stuff) so I left my lumber at Lowes and went to Home Depot. Never been back and I’ve never regretted it.
2828,">I always find myself leaving Lowe's and going to HD because our Lowe's is run and operated by idiots, who don't know how to do their work,  constantly screw up, and also don't care about a customer a single bit.  I used to frequent Lowe's after one bad experience at HD with an asshole employee. Just at a bad time I guess. I've since experienced their employees are more knowledgeable in my area - or at least try to help in some way.  Over time I got sick of the know nothing and holier than thou attitudes at Lowe's. Every one of the Lowe's in my area are seemingly full of the type of employees that post in r/lowes."
2829,"I agree. I have become much more familiar with the layout of the store and where to find certain things than their staff. The breaking point for me at Lowe's was when I was looking for a threaded insert for something I was building. I showed the guy in the hardware dept a picture and explained what I was looking for. He told me ""I don't think anyone makes anything like that. I'm pretty sure you'll have to find a way to machine it"". I ended up just finding it myself and never went back."
2830,"I live in Atlanta—the Home Depot Mecca— and I still find that the few Lowes around generally have a better selection. I *want* to use HD exclusively because theyre so convenient for me, but they just dont have the selection."
2831,Lowes seems to have more of a focus selling you on contactors.   Home Depot is more focused on selling to contractors.
2832,Exactly. Case in point this morning. Needed a 1/2 inch toilet supply line. Lowes only had 3/8.  HD down the street had an entire selection of them...
2833,"Bingo, there are basically no Lowe's in Chicago"
2834,"I think its regional, Home Depot here has really good customer service, Lowe's just seems confused. Also Lowes is full of gimmicky garbage tools."
2835,"I've had a different experience. At Home Depot the staff is chipper and *seemingly* helpful, but I haver never gotten an answer. What does happen over and over with them is that they'll say they need to go ask someone who knows and then never come back.       At Lowe's, they aren't fake friendly, don't leave to flag down another sucker, and actually know some things about the section.      It just feels like Home Depot spends all their training effort on the assumption that their people won't be there long enough to be useful, so may as well train them to be nice."
2836,"Lowe’s employees receive little training, usually the people that work there have been there for way too long and hate life and a couple years ago corporate got rid of dept managers and left area managers, fired a bunch of people and... yeah... fuck Lowe’s"
2837,"Home Depot > Lowe's  HD is usually a little cheaper, has awesome cheap 5 gal buckets, and has 4 self checkouts + one register. Lowe's takes forever to get through checkout, usually only 1 or 2 registers open, rarely 3. Forget going to Lowe's on the weekend, it's a complete shit show. HD gets worse on weekends as well, but not Lowe's bad. This is of course my local stores, probably not a nation wide thing.   Lowe's feels more like Sears + Hardware store   HD feels more like a dedicated hardware store."
2838,"In my area HD has a much more modern self check out system. You just grab the gun and scan away, without even removing stuff from your cart.  Lowes on the other hand still has the self checkout system that makes you put everything on their scale/bagging area after you scan it. Try buying a few loose nuts and bolts that practically weigh nothing and dont register anything on their scale, you will be there forever. Item is in the bagging area it just doesnt fuckin weigh anything. Then the cashier comes over hits a few buttons to make the system ignore the scale and it works for the 1 item and then they walk away... but, but I still have 30 more nuts to scan and I have to wait for her to come back 30 more times. This was right after I watched a guy going around their flooring section for 15 minutes shouting ""hello, does anyone work here?""   Fuck Lowe's. HD all the way.  Either way whenever I'm doing the self checkout my mind always goes back to Bill Burr's rant about the self checkout at grocery stores."
2839,My Lowe's doesn't have self-checkout and there's usually only one register open.  I go to Home Depot.
2840,"Yes! I liked hd as they seem to have better tools but the biggest win is the checkout. I walk up, scan my stuff, pay and leave. At Lowe's they have the slowest lines. The old ladies working the register are nice but soooo slow"
2841,I forgot that Lowe’s takes forever to check out
2842,"When I worked at Home Depot I used to be jealous that the guys at Lowes across the street got to wear the blue vest and we had to wear some bullshit apron.  So there's that.  edit: Looking at some of these answers, just want to point a few things out. HD and Lowes both have a military/veteran discount. Both allow dogs on leashes inside. Also, any HD cashier has the authority to give you 10% or $50 off, up to $50. You just have to ask for it basically."
2843,"I didn’t realize Home Depot had a policy allowing dogs in stores. Wife and I were in Home Depot a few months ago purchasing window treatments. As we were sitting with the associate, guy walked past with his daughter and off-leash dog. Dog proceeded to take massive dump on the floor and scooted around, smearing it all over the place. Guy either didn’t notice or didn’t care and started to walk away, but my wife noticed and called him out. He came up to the associate who gave him paper towels and spray to clean it up."
2844,Oh my god this happened at my Home Depot too except the giant dog peed a 1 gal puddle in the middle of an aisle.
2845,Our HD wanted to call and verify veterans. They would only give discounts to retired and 100 disabled veterans. That’s none of their business. Our HD is crappy.
2846,"At Lowe's I had to register at customer service and provide my dd214.  I guess they must have had an issue with fakers or something.   However,  now I just give them my phone # and show my retiree ID and it applies my discount and emails my receipt to me, which is convenient."
2847,HD got rid of their veterans discount a few years ago. Did they bring it back recently?
2848,If I ask and show VA id Depot still gives discount to me.  Granted they do exclude a lot of items
2849,Hmmm. I dont think that true. I've been using HD veteran discount at checkout and I have always gotten it. The only times I've had issues have been on online orders.
2850,Home depot has changed their dog policy. The one in my area said we couldn't bring him in there.
2851,"> Home depot has changed their dog policy. The one in my area said we couldn't bring him in there.  It has always been a per-store policy. Most stores allow them, but I have been to both HD and Lowes stores that didn't."
2852,"I don't have an HD near me, so it's Lowe's or Menards. Every time I go to Lowe's I always swear I'm going to boycott it. Definitely Menards."
2853,I can't find a damn thing at Lowe's.  Menards.
2854,Menards beats the pants off both in terms of selection.
2855,"I'm a contractor.  Home depot is more seeded within my working radius however I use both.  I am more familiar with Home Depot, their store layouts and their products.  On the occasion I go into Lowes, I find their layout seems to be more standardized.  I have a $12,500 credit limit with Home Depot and only $2,500 with Lowes, however as a Platinum PRO I get a 2.5% discount with Home Depot but I get 5% with Lowes.  I spend roughly $60,000 a year.  The return policies at both stores are about the same, but I can just use my card at Home Depot whereas I have to save my receipt to do returns at Lowes.    Assistance (or lack thereof) isn't really an issue with me (lol I know more than you... aka Ron Swanson).  The HD app on my phone is useful but I've never checked to see if Lowes has one.  A decade ago, I had a conversation with my friend who convinced me to go independent and our conclusion was that Home Depot was best suited for the contractor however Lowes had better Designer options.  All stores have theft protocols.  I'm well accustomed to the automatic checkout with Home Depot however I do like the probability of having a human available at Lowes.    End of the day, I use Home Depot more, but that's because there's one less than a mile away from my house on my path to most of my jobs.  I've got a lot of familiar strangers that I can say hi to when I start my day."
2856,"I like HD better in general, they have a deeper selection of products, tools, lumber and trim.  I like Behr paint a lot more than Valspar, and I like Ridgid tools a lot more than kobalt.  I go to Lowe's 95% of the time though, because I can take my dog on a leash and get her some exercise and social time, so unless I need paint or tools, Lowe's it is.  I've been trying to go to Ace/local lumber yard lately, but the lumber yard people are so rude, it feels like they do not want you there.  I love Ace stores, except they're so small I always have to go somewhere else to get everything I need."
2857,The HDs by me all allow pets on leash.
2858,"I've seen pets at HD, but when I checked their website about a year ago, the official policy was only service animals.  The sign at the front door of my local HD says the same thing.  I probably could take the dog, but when someone's kid runs up and pokes her in the butthole, and she turns around and barks and scares them, I don't want to have to deal with the drama of her technically not supposed to have been there."
2859,"Yes. All the Home Depot’s here about a year ago changed it to no dogs allowed. Besides service, obviously. Lowe’s you can still bring them."
2860,HD for contacting Lowe's for homeowners
2861,"Yup, this is exactly how I word it. HD for materials, Lowe's for products works too"
2862,"This.  Also for more advanced homeowners the HD near me is better, especially with wood selection.  The customer service is horrible, unfortunately.  Edit: Lowe's won't do home delivery for me where HD will. Sorry, I don't own a pickup for deck lumber..."
2863,"Honestly, HD lost my appliance business when they wouldn't let me pick up a microwave, because its an appliance, so it must be delivered.  I might have let that one go, but the $399 microwave was on sale for 10% off, which put the price below $396, which is their cutoff for free delivery, so they were going to chance a $59 delivery fee.  So they wanted me to pay $455, plus tax, for a $399 microwave, that was on sale.  I went to Best Buy and picked up the exact same model microwave two days later, for $369 + tax."
2864,"Home Depot is the epitome of ""not my department, go see that guy"".  It once took me 2.5 hours for them to find my a tools chest that they said they had 5 in stock of. I eventually left and ordered it online to pick up in store. I got an email the next day saying it was ready for pick up. I arrive and nobody has a clue what's going on. Repeat day 1. I cancelled order, called customer service to get original order refunded and then requested that it be shipped to my house free of charge. The product came in two boxes. Only one box was shipped. They didn't believe me that only one box shipped and ask that I take a picture to verify only one box showed up. I was just like ""how can I take a picture of a box that doesn't exist?"". They told me they would send the second box. Guess what showed up 3 days later? Two boxes or the original product. I called and they wanted me to pay for shipping to send the item back, not a chance, get me a return label. They did, I send it back and then get a phone call that I only returned part of an item and that my credit card will be charged if the entire item isn't recieved.  I now shop at Rona."
2865,"I have a friend who was trying to get a dishwasher installed.  He bought it and picked it up, Home Depot set up the installation for the next weekend.  Two days later the Home Depot delivery truck stopped by and left another dishwasher on his patio while he was out.  The weekend came, the installer showed up....with another dishwasher in his truck.  He ended up taking two back, got so tired of waiting for someone to understand what was going on that he just left them and went home."
2866,I agree with this gentleman although the Lowe’s by me does a better job of making sure hardware is in the right place/bins. Checkout times are all over the place right now at both ime.
2867,"I was in the process of replacing a toilet and needed my husband's help holding it while I got it lined up but his grip was slipping so the toilet dropped by about an inch.  It was just far enough that the edge of it tapped the basement floor and shattered the front of the brand new toilet.  This had already been a hell of a project as I had to replace the flange and re-cement the floor (why the fuck would someone embed a donut-shaped piece of plywood into cement to screw the flange into).  I headed back to Home Depot to purchase a replacement and took my daughter along for the ride.  While at the store a staff member helped me load a toilet onto a cart while I told her the tale of the smashed toilet.  My daughter needed to pee so I left the cart and rushed my daughter halfway across the giant store with the urgency required of a 4 year-old's emergency.  When I got back to my cart there was an invoice sitting on it for $0 stating ""customer satisfaction"" and a hand-written note wishing me a wonderful evening.    They didn't have to do that. I didn't ask for anything because I was totally at fault.  They definitely won my business that day."
2868,Lowe’s when ordering online (and not needing it immediately because their online pick up orders take forever compared to HD) because I can log in and verify my veteran status and get the discount...  HD if I’m going to the local store
2869,"I use lowes for the discount also, but sometime I think their prices are 9% higher than hd."
2870,Oh I got back and forth on the app to see if it’s cheaper to just go into HD or easier and cheaper to go through Lowes
2871,Been waiting 2 days for Lowe’s to fill my order
2872,"Lowes doesn't carry Milwaukee tools soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  &#x200B;  But for real, I go to both for different things, or when there's no preference. Usually HD for tools and construction lumber, Lowes for select lumber and electrical, HD for gardening, and other than that I shop at both for whatever I need. Lowes has a horrible online store and inventory system, so I typically only do online orders through HD.  The milwork person at my local Lowes is MUCH better than Home Depot's. She also gave me contractor pricing on our order which was very nice. Home Depot was a pain in the ass to work with getting our patios doors ordered and successfully delivered."
2873,"Ah yes, one of the other reasons I don’t go to Lowe’s.  Lowe’s craftsman always confuses me. I see red and I’m like “woohoo milwaukee!”  Then I get closer and am disappointed"
2874,Love my new Milwaukee tools
2875,"I try to avoid both honestly.  My local electrical supply house has a way better selection and usually better prices on anything electrical related.  HD and Lowes are both INSANELY HIGH on their price per ft for wire, probably because most people just don't know better.  There's a large local lumberyard about the same distance away as HD, their prices are comparable, sometimes cheaper.  Nicest part is, I can call them up and rattle off a list of materials I need, show up a half hour later and they have it all stacked and wrapped on a pallet ready to load into my truck.  They also have a great project desk that is more than willing to help design & spec out things like decks, fences, awnings or lean-tos, etc. for no extra fee."
2876,Comparing HD and Lowe's to a dedicated supply house isn't fair. Of course the electrical supply place will be better for electrical stuff. But it's not a one stop shop.
2877,"Home Depot seems to be marginally cheaper than Lowe’s, at least when I’ve compared prices online before going to the store. Lowes employees tend to be more helpful."
2878,"I used to favor Home Depot because I drove past it every day, then moved and switched to Lowes because it's closer now. Of the two, my Home Depot no longer has knowledgeable people to ask questions (they all seem to be minimum-wage clerks who don't even pretend to know anything) while Lowe's still does.  If I need a lot of lumber, I avoid the big box stores and go to an actual lumber yard because of the huge quality difference."
2879,"Lowe's bought OSH, a local hardware store that was really nice, and pretty much immediately closed them all down.  Because of that I only shop at Home Depot now."
