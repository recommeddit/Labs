111,Source Code is very similar\n\nBit of a stretch but Solaris (1972) is way different in tone but deals with a person's mind effecting the world around them, 8,/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/n5w7p3/movies_similar_to_inception/gx4e6d7/

119,"If you haven't seen *Memento,* which was what put Nolan in the view of mainstream filmgoers, it's definitely worth a watch.\n\nCan you say more about what you liked about *Inception* that you're looking for in other movies? Was it the style itself, the team-pulls-off-a-heist story, the high concept of going into someone else's mind, the ambiguity factor, the grand landscapes/set-pieces? Knowing more about what you're looking for might help folks give better recommendations.\n\nFor a completely off-the-wall recommendation, but one which may be a kind of spiritual sibling to *Inception,* check out *Dave Made A Maze* if you want to have some fun. \n\nBest of luck!", 17,/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/n5w7p3/movies_similar_to_inception/gx3nzc3/

261,"Not to rain on your parade but 33 has always had an occult meaning. Especially in Christianity - Jesus died at 33 for example. Many things appear in triplets as well - heaven, earth, hell. Past, present, future. And I guess in a Dan Brown novel 33 somehow leads to the meaning of life for what that's worth. \n\n<spoilers ahead>\n\nThat's not to say they weren't inspired by this song's lyrics somehow, even if it is about Dan Deacon tripping really hard. Writers can take influences from weird shit. Overall the show is heavily influenced by stuff like Twin Peaks and David Fincher but who knows how they thought up little details like missing ears. The whole dead birds thing for example reminded me of the game *Life is Strange* which is also heavily about time travel - going back in time causes much of the local wildlife to randomly drop dead just like in Dark. Whether they actually played the game or the dead animals thing is a reference to something else entirely I'm not sure though.
