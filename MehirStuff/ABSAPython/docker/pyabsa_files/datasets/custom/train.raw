$T$ is definitely not the best . we are number one in military budget and that ' s essentially it . As I live here and have only visited two other countries ( Canada and Mexico ) I don ' t think I have the authority to say which is the best to live in , as I have not lived anywhere else , but ...

band 5 is what $T$ uses for low band 5G also known as Nationwide 5G  in most of the US . Verion doesn ' t have any band 5 in most of Texas so they have to use bands 2 or 66 . Both bands are higher frequency which mean they don ' t travel as far or penetrate buildings as well . So at least inside one can expect worse 5G performance in these are vs areas that use band 5

My mother ’ s boyfriend died 10 years ago . She recently mentioned he loved wearing    $T$ and that she got him a bottle of it every Christmas . I bought it for her . She sprayed it on her arm and started to cry , tears of loss and memories and joy of experiencing it all again . I think it ’ s the best present I gave her , and that present made her cry . Life is complicated

Any $T$ degree + computer science  opens you up for bioinformatics as well , which is a lesser known but super interesting field . There is so much data being generated by research now that it ' s difficult for humans to analyze it all , so computers are being used more and more to parse and analyze all this data . There still aren ' t a ton of people that know enough about both biology and CS to do bioinformatics , though ,

Shin $T$  is basically Persona without the Highschool theme ( if I remember correctly , Persona is technically a spinoff of SMT but overshadows the mainline games by now ). SMT3 ( Nocturne ) is getting a HD remaster and SMT5 is supposed to be released sometime in 2021 .

I live in Frisco and found the same thing . We had been on $T$ a few years ago and it was fine . Then we switched to TMo a couple years ago when I started with a new company and got a good deal on TMo service and they basically paid off our two iPhone X to switch . Service was okay but for me more inconsistent than Verizon . We just switched back to Verizon in October when they were giving $ 550

As a proud raimimemer , $T$ all the way . Why ? Cheesy , Superhero nostalgia . Superhero movies are mostly way too serious now than the Raimi Spider - Man trilogy ever was . And that ' s fine when the story requires it , but a superhero movie is basically us suspending disbelief in order to enjoy this two hour feature , so no one would really mind if some things were over the top . It ' s why Shazam is good

Good point , I think I compared the two because they ’ re both often behind . $T$ took a long time to release a mech keyboards that matched the features of their high end plastic frame and rubber dome keyboards ; a lot of recent bose stuff doesn ’ t even natively support Bluetooth and their current lineup has incredibly minimal homekit features only recently got airplay and that ’ s probably only because their Bluetooth was so bad

It ’ s $ 400 on Amazon and Best Buy but Amazon day is on the 13th and the price may go down and you can have Best Buy price match it so it ’ s easier returns / warranty and no shipping time . https :// www . bestbuy . com / site / dell - s2719dgf - 27 - led - qhd - freesync - monitor - black

$T$ is a great country to live in - but the consistency may end up boring you . No - one talks about the weather - because it is the same every day . Tomorrow will be 31 or 32C and you will probably get a thunderstorm late afternoon . The difference between the longest day ( mid - Summer ) and the shortest day ( mid - Winter ) is only 8 minutes - so the sun always comes up about 7am and

My wife picked up three pair of sunglasses from “ $T$ ” last summer , and she loves them . About a third of the price of the Luxotica stuff and seem excellent so far . I ’ m still sporting a pair of Spy Optic  glasses I picked up on a whim a few years ago . Best aviators I ’ ve ever owned , at half the price of my other pairs .

Hahaha I ' m guessing you meant salon but a $T$ is my idea of me - time :) In all seriousness though at that age , for me , being away from the Baby was more stressful than not getting a break . Depends on the mom . I would say a massage and a sleep in is a delightful idea though .

$T$ is less gender equal when it comes to things like choice of profession compared to other similar countries . This is usually referred to as the Nordic equality paradox . Turns out that when you make it easier for both genders to choose whatever career path they like , the difference in the actual choices increase , not decrease . Policies that increase oppurtunity tends to make outcomes less equal .

Wonder Woman has no comparison , but both parks have a Freespin , a Discovery , a Batman Clone , a Pandemonium , a Hybrid ( I rank them pretty evenly , Rattler

I had the opportunity to volunteer ballboy for $T$  when I was 15 . After the match we were all lined up in the tunnel and the players walked past . Rafa took the time to introduce himself and thank us for volunteering . I was 2nd in line so I had the privilege of actually shaking his hand !

Turns out the Ambassador was the hotel where Jeffrey Dahmer ' s first murder took place . Legend has it , he cut up a

According to my experience , $T$  don ' t do much for your water quality ( they remove roughly 10 % of the contaminants ). If you really want to improve your water quality , I suggest looking for an RO system . I personally have very good experiences with the AquaTru waterfilter , which are available in the US and EU . This filter has been thoroughly tested by the NSF , removing up to 99 % of all the contaminants in

Don ' t forget $T$   by Philip Pullman . None of the traditional fantasy tropes ( the first one is a twelve year old girl riding an armored polar bear to the Arctic in a steampunk universe with her shape - shifting animal familiar ) and it ' s aimed at teens and tweens so its a simple read , but it deals with some pretty heavy issues .

I disagree . $ 70 is not much and you get * such a better * camera . The color * suuuuuuuucks * on the $T$ . Lots of people are saying you never go fullscreen . That is wrong , uninteresting streamers never go full screen . Good streamers have tons of different scenes , including full screen for chatting with viewers .

$T$ will do more to prevent colds than any damn thing you can do . That said I take some zinc + vitamin c  tablets at the first sign of a cold and the cold disappears in about 24 hours 80 % of the time . Seriously . Prevention is better than cure .

Stetson , Thanks for your work . I think you should add $T$  plans . They really change the game for low data users .  $ 9 for unlimited talk and text + $ 2 / GB data . The fact that one can add data as needed in the middle of month is wonderful . For us retirees two lines with 1 GB pooled data per month costs only $ 10 . 49 per month . How can that be beat on

Aye ! Though what bugs me about the $T$ is that they are closer to a portable headphone design in size than a full - size headphone design . They have quite heavy cables though , suggesting they really are intended as desktop headphones ostensibly for audio monitoring . I haven ' t worn them for any long period of time though - are they comfortable for long periods compared to other full sized closed backs ? ( DT770 , 1540 , Z7 , etc

Probably a once and a lifetime opportunity , I was invited on a trip by a female friend to the Caribbean and this little resort called $T$  , you can only get to it via helicopter or sea plane as the roads are awful . I ' m used to hotels like best western which are normal , but this place was super posh . I think the best part was how peaceful it was , it was so removed from busy society ,

It ' s such a weird complaint for people to make about $T$  . Like , * oh , they won ' t protect your eyes from UV and you will go blind * but fancy sunglasses aren ' t $ 200 because the lenses are expensive -- it ' s the frames . Cheap polycarbonate plastic lenses block it all just fine , which is why safety glasses are like $ 3 -$ 5 . It happens a lot with sport sunglasses too

I saw the most of the major ones coming but I think that ' s because it was so intricately plotted . Movies sometimes just focus on one gotcha without laying any groundwork for it to make it more unpredictable . $T$ , on the other hand , was brimming with subtlety and gave the viewers a much fairer chance at the guessing game .

Our new  $T$ doesn ' t sound nearly as good and I think cost $ 400 , but it is super good at blocking off background noise . That ' s the only thing it is good at .

Sorry for the huge post , but pencils are one of my favourite things ! Get a few hardnesses of pencil , HB is middle ; B is soft & H is hard . I usually have an HB , a $T$ and a 4B .

Can guarantee you that if you drop your $T$ on any type of surface , they will pretty much only get scratched . I don ' t know if you are slam dunking your glasses onto the sidewalk , but i ' ve dropped mine plenty of times and they are fine . Even had a few close calls where i stepped or slightly sat on them and they were fine . I also think the losing your glasses argument is pretty bad . I

I ' m of the opinion that *   $T$   * is the greatest work of science fiction ever written . I ' m also of the opinion that it is not for everyone . The enjoyment comes only when you ' re a fan of long , staring - out - the - window - on - a - rainy - day reflection between chapters ( sometimes even between paragraphs ). You have to enjoy exegesis to truly find joy

$T$ is not written in Haskell , it ' s written in C . And yes , it might be a bit weird , because it is unique in this respect , but that ' s the price for keeping the shell always in sight . As everything nonetheless , there are pros and cons .

i may get hate for this but i really dont like $T$ , i think she lacks empathy and just doesnt care about anything or anyone . she gaslights everybody but will never look at herself and admit that she is ever wrong . i also think she is a hypocrite with this whole “ i care so much about the world ” act when we all know how she and her family live . thats my opinion 🤔

I guess $T$ could have been respected by many people due to the fact that he was in the position to make a mess out of Europe alone , not that he was ' respected by the people ' in that sense . So it opens the argument into a huge can of worms destroyed by semantics . Which probably means I need to revise the question . I would really like to have a Vietnamese person answer due to Ho Chi Minh   ... I

$T$ quality has gone to shit . I returned 3 backpacks that all broke within a few years of use . Of the three new bags they sent as replacement , 2 of them are already broken again , the third is on its way .

First , thanks for the thread . I spent a lot of time trying to find a good one and finally started working with the free ( time limited ) version of $T$ . The thing I most wanted it to do though was highlight the differences in a couple of files opened side by side , and could sometimes get that to work for a large part of the files , but sometimes ( if I remember right ) not at all . Finally

It ' s really not that hard to learn how to find all of the ' Cs ' on a $T$ . The shapes were more intuitive to me than keys . Once I learned the major and minor barre chords as well as some open chords I felt like I could play along to anything ... Then again , I am drummer that plays some bass , guitar and keys so what do I know ? lol . Let the drummer bashing begin !

I love the absolutely minimal cases like $T$ .

Yes , the $T$  is stronger than most of the HP Envy devices out there . The Legion 5 15 "    is a bit more powerful but has a shorter battery life . It could always go on sale later on , but I don ' t know for certain .

The only reason I still recommend the $T$ is because it regularly goes on sale for half off everywhere , and dollar for dollar , it will retain quality and give a huge bang for your buck . Buying something cheap and then going to a 920 in a year isn ' t helpful cuz it ' s much more expensive to do so long run . Better to just not use a cam save another 20 or 30 bucks and buy the half price

Replacement . I usually just have one running shoe for cardio and replace them every couple of years . $T$ were suggested in the past and they felt good so I ended up just using them . Generally I don ' t need an up tempo shoe since I ' m not really racing / running for best times , but I don ' t want something super bulky either . Feel like Adrenaline was a pretty good compromise that offered good stability and decent

I ' ve also got a few chargers and cables made by $T$ that have never been a problem in the 3 - 4 years I ' ve had them , besides one cable that doesn ' t work 100 %, but that ' s due to how it was treated by others in the house . Pulling and stretching any cable so it ' s at a 90 degree angle coming out of the connector is always going to shorten its life .

We played vanilla pandemic using the Legacy game ( just ignoring the extra components ) until we won a game , then we moved onto the Legacy stuff . I think that ’ s the best way to do it , because you do want to understand the game well before starting your Legacy journey since mistakes in early games can

$T$  has every single physical you would want in a WR : he ' s tall , he ' s fast , he can jump , and he has amazing hands .

1 . $T$ - on Netflix . Great mystery / thriller show . Requires 110 % of your attention . There is a lot going on and it ' s key that you follow who each character is . One of the best shows I ' ve seen in the last few years 2 . Assassination of Gianni Versace : America Crime Story        - the main character / villian is acted so well and has such a creepy vibe to him that ' s hard

I have often had to defend my love of $T$  and his music to friends and co - workers who ' s best argument is " he just looks so nasty and sleazy ". I often point to things he has done and said that seem to suggest that he is a down to earth , " good " person . I am glad a few people can share the sentiment and at least one redditor can attest to the fact .

Cos Marvel is hindered by having the overarching story to deal with . You can ' t have a clear or well developed trilogy of films that tells a consistent story cos you gotta keep enough the same for when Infinity War comes round . It ' s why  $T$ and  Nolan Batman are gonna be best superhero films for awhile cos they insular ( yeah Spiderman 3  and TDKR aren ' t great but still ).

In a similar vein , try $T$ if you can afford it .

For my money , $T$    are the last truly great racing games with a sense of progression . The newer shit is really just " here ' s a bunch of cars and some generic upgrades you can buy immediately and tweak from day one ." I want that RPG feeling of starting off broke with junker stock cars then move up to higher and higher tiers of upgrades and cash , and even higher end base models .

I have both a $T$ and a regular electric toothbrush , and can ' t make up my mind which is better . Why do people swear on the Sonicare ? Is it just because its the " Trendiest " toothbrush now , or because it ' s people ' s first electric toothbrush . My theory is that any electric toothbrush is 100x better than the manual kind , so sonicare or the standard kind are both fine .

Meh . " Treason " is overselling it . He did something unsightly that wouldn ' t play well with the electorate , but the Logan Act is unenforceable and unconstitutional and there ' s no way he would have gone down for merely talking to a foreign leader . By that logic $T$  would be in jail for his letter to Iran . He definitely could have lost the election .

It ' s not on the US one so you would have to change your region to Canada but $T$  matches your description . Firefly is smartly written and has great dialogue ( when it comes to that any Joss Whedon show tbh ) and Gilmore girls  also has really clever and witty dialogue

$T$ is FIRE friendly . Your biggest issue is going to be the immigration / VISA issue . Find a list of countries where you can be an expat and then ask your question about those countries . For example , New Zealand  is great , but you either need to be a citizen , have a specific skill and want to work , or have many millions to buy your way in .

Used both the $T$ ($ 33 USD for two ), and the supershieldz ($ 7 for three ). I didn ' t personally install the paperlike , as the ipad I used already had it on . While I put the supershieldz on my own 11 ". Even if the paperlike was cheaper , I still preferred the shieldz . Felt better , looked better . I can ' t go back to glass , just like writing and drawing

The average wireless gaming headset battery life is like 10 - 20 . The only thing that comes close to Bluetooth battery life is the $T$ . Which is closer to 100hours Wireless gaming headsets are Rf not Bluetooth . Wireless headphones are Bluetooth . Often called headsets but that ' s just because they have a built in call grade mic . Not good for gaming . Bad mic quality and too high of latency .

From what we ' ve seen so far , it will be an incremental upgrade over the $T$ . But I will say this , they ' ve been dropping the price of their base model iphone from XR to 11 for example . So , if you can get by on your current phone , wait till the 12 launches . If you want , you can buy the 12 at that time , but the 11 will be even cheaper by then .

I have to vouch for $T$  . I met him at a Wal - Mart when I was 11 . I saw him in the home and garden section , I said something dumb like " Whoa The Rock !" he was dressed in one of those $ 500 dollar shirts with fancy glasses and turned , took the glasses off raised his eyebrow and said " What are you looking at jabroni ?" then started laughing and shook my hand .

Best was $T$  . it really was an amazing Generation . BW1 had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   Let ‘ s Go  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks

I ' d agree with that . $T$     fits in the same place Dresden Files  does personally . There are some neat ideas , the world is cool , and the writing gets the point across and is occasionally witty / funny . They ' re the " summer action movie " in book form . And they ' re fun for that .

Quick sanity check - I switched to $T$  ( AT & T ) from my Verizon plan . I bought the sim card and the monthly plan from the Red Pocket  site . I now want to buy the annual plan from eBay . Will I have issues adding the 12 month plan to my existing account at Red Pocket  ? Please and thank you .

$T$   if you like marvel games . I know its pay to win or collect , but if you are happy with not getting all the new characters in the first month , you should enjoy it .

$T$ is always spoken about highly , everybody that ’ s met her always say that she ’ s very sweet . I ’ m not sure about the rest . They probably avoid talking to people at all costs .

Please dont hurt me , but wouldnt the consoles be capable enough to do even the largest maps of $T$ acceptably ( heck my HD4000 doesnt fare terribly on them )?, that on the technical side so i wondered what ( apart from the 100 players cap ) was dumbed down , dummied out or cut .

$T$ . I ' m not trying to be all " Murica !!!", but it really is . It ' s literally the center of modern civilization . Other countries have better human rights , better laws , but when it comes down to it , everything gets compared to American standards , that ' s not without a reason .

$T$   is about $ 3500 per 6 month term , completely online , non - profit , and competency based . If you have previous education your credits may transfer , and if you ’ re already competent in a subject you can pass a class in a day . They have both business and tech degrees .

Depends on what genres of music you like best . $T$ and pianos are out of the question if you ' re into rock , for the most part . Bass is easier to learn than guitar due to the lack of chords you ' ll be playing , but guitars are smaller and might feel more comfortable . I started with a keyboard , graduated to the guitar and then drums . Bass came naturally after I learned guitar . Learn by ear .

I ' m a huge fan of them - I bought my $T$  because I test drove one and fell in love . Having lived with it for 7 months now , I don ' t really see the point of buying a new gas car and dealing with the inconveniences of gas , assuming you have a reasonable commute and a dedicated parking spot at home to charge . If you ' re generic suburban homeowner , they ' re perfect right now

$T$  actually does seem like a genuinely intelligent and nice guy . I don ' t care what anybody thinks , [ The Rundown / Welcome to The Jungle ]( http :// www . imdb . com / title / tt0327850 /) is one of my favourite movies of all time . Perfect mix of action and comedy , in my opinion . And his performance in it was fantastic . Shit , now I feel like re - watching that

Top 5 just got shook up by a seasonal so let ' s go ! 1 $T$  ' s theme is really complexly built as it organically makes it ms characters wonder what they will leave behind when they ' re gone .

The key to restoring a bag after compromising the zipper is the ability to freely pass the zipper back over the opened area .

Another method I use with a lock is a low strength brightly colored $T$  through

Verizon is good for the most part but there are a bunch of weird dead zones , including anywhere on the beach . 4G availability is decent but not great .   AT & T has by far the best coverage , both phone and internet , in my experience . If you ' re scared

My dad tells us the story of a coffee date he went on in college , and the girl he was with noticed $T$  was there ordering a coffee . She keeps trying to make eye contact but eventually realised that Tim was checking out my dad ! I ' ll be honest my dad ' s not a very serious man , but he swears this one is true . Either way take it with a grain of salt

To be honest , I think that the way it sounds is the least important criteria when it comes to writing . I initially wanted to record how they all sound , but I realised that all three that I ’ ve tried produce the same scratchy sound . The major difference is in the feedback that you get as you write on it . The $T$ has a very subtle grip that you won ’ t notice if you scribbled over it , but

I like to look at hotels $T$ sites as they usually have user photos . Not the elaborately staged bedroom photos . It ' s a good way to get your mind around the location from the every day eye . Also talk to a rep with a holiday firm . Most have travelled more than the average Joe . And will have good recommendations . Local word of mouth is my favourite . Best food and nights out I have had is following a

$T$ are very good for technical sketching . I still have a 0 . 5mm one I got from my grandfather . On the same vein , cross pencils are quite good , and can be cheaper if you ' re in the US .

$T$  stopped by the comic / game store where a friend of mine used to work . Dude bought about $ 300 worth of Warhammer 40K models ( he was trying to build out his Eldar army , he said ), and stayed around to chat with the staff before he left for a show he was headlining in town . Took pictures with all the staff before he left . Sounds like a real decent dude .

Aqualina Pink Sugar   is good for the price , however , worth noting that for a few dollars more you can easily get Reb ' l Fleur    , Fantasy or $T$ , which are somewhat in similar ballpark but all smell of higher quality .

$T$   . I bought it because someone at a resturant was wearing it and I had to ask what it was . It ' s amazing , but not too " sexy ". Like a mix of sexy , fresh and floral .

I never get people who don ' t watch dark movies multiple times . If a movie is really good , I ' m watching it again eventually . $T$    and Oldoy get better every time I rewatch them . I ' m planning on rewatching Grave of the Fireflies    soon too .

I stayed at a $T$ one night and it was the best sleep I ever had . The mattress was fantastic . Went home and called Marriott to ask what kind of mattress it was and got “ one moment let me transfer you to our mattress sales department .” One surprised frankentriple , 1300 dollars and two weeks later Marriott delivered a king size to my door . I ’ m sure my ex is still sleeping in complete comfort 15 years later

I can recommend some games , but it ' ll help if you answer a few questions first . What games have you played before , and which ones did you like ? Who would you realistically play the most with ? Would you mostly be playing 2 player , 3 player , 4 player , etc ? What kind of complexity are you looking for ( more than $T$ , less , about the same )?

A used $T$  can take you a long way as you can find some for around 100 $, but that ' s about cheap GPU , not really in your budget in a way . A 5600XT or 1080TI would be your best bet , at around 300 $ used . Don ' t forget to get some thermal paste and thermal pads in case you want to buy used , so you don ' t run in any overheating issue . Or

I ' m happy with $T$  ( 1440p curved VA ). The blacks are really deep . Since I had never used a VA panel monitor before I was impressed with the deep blacks . It feels more responsive than my old IPS Asus VP249QGR   and at least to me it doesn ' t feel like the colors are any worse . I don ' t get what black smearing is all about , I hope I never learn it \^\^

Yup subscription - based . Using it correctly though , I dropped off 10K + CC debt in a year and am very aware of my expenses and I HATE $T$ under normal circumstances . Mainly because it is for apps I use maybe once a year . I log into YNAB daily and considering how much it has helped me it ' s been worth the money .

Yes $T$  is the best RPG right now ( for me ), i got stuck at my first playtrough at 30 % too . But you have to continue the game , unfortunately its a bit boring at some parts around 30 % but it will get better

As it stand right now I wouldn ' t want an EV . Range can still be an issue , as is charging the cars . I live in the countryside , my town has a grand total of three chargers . None of these are of the high speed kind so getting a full charge will take some patience . Even with superchargers like $T$ you still have to be willing to wait some time , at the risk of your batterylife . There

There is really no difference in 99 % of places . $T$ is not really that much better than T - mobile   in a lot of places but they go by the Apple philosophy of charge more and people assume that means higher quality .

Yeah I used to love $T$     , fucking loved that shit . They are stuck because it ' s a console game sold to kids . It ' s just going to continue to shit out the same iterations because it ' s what the people want . It ' s been too long for them to change . It ' s like giving Madden a complete overhaul , not gonna happen as long as it keeps selling .

Sadly , yup . I kept telling people on this sub and on r / movies that they do not understand just how much the general audience loved $T$  . My wife has no love for comic stuff like me and she went to see that movie 3 times . My mom , who probably never saw a superhero movie in her life , went to go see it twice . It ’ s a flawed movie , maybe not the best MCU flick

I ' d vote more for $T$ . Always have a great day there . Last couple visits I ' ve had at Hershey went bad . Ranging from having sunglasses and almost my wallet stolen at Skyrush , another visit being unbearable in the heat and half the food stands I wanted were either beyond busy or just for some reason not open that day .

Might be on the linked lists ... but I love $T$  . Some of his books are on the longer side , but worth the payoff . I ’ ve read anathem and snowcrash so far .

It ' s the same as elementary statistics except with calculus ; you need to apply the right concepts at the right time . Also , be open to do programming as that will give you even more job / internships opportunities . $T$ and Python are probably the top two . You can look up " probability theory " to see what calculus plays a role in statistics , that course is the toughest one for most Stats programs .

I ' m betting that the $T$  is for the vitamin C . Just take it in tablet form , I find the orange flavoured chewy   ones to be quite pleasant . This is a well known remedy but do not use it for sick kids , raising their body temperature that much can be really dangerous .

The $T$ has impeccable image quality for the price ( it ' d be hard not to with a glossy IPS display ) and reasonable color calibration , but it ' s not great for fast gaming . Due to high pixel response times , pixel overshoot and PWM backlighting , it exhibits wicked amounts of motion blur in fast - paced FPS like TF2 . It ' s also an Acer product , so the QC is sub - par . Mine already has

Does the brown color of the $T$ stick out like a sore thumb ? I ' m a little worried that it wouldn ' t look good with the rest of my setup , which is mostly black / white . I had the shidenkai for about a year and removed it ' s top glass layer after it burned out . Ive been thinking about getting the raiden .

So , depending on the maker , I wear a double or triple E in dress shoes . I really like the feel of $T$  and the Saucony equivalent when I first put them on , but my feet start to hurt after a while . Any suggestions on a shoe ? Mostly running for fitness . Don ' t see myself going for longer than 45 minutes anytime in the next six months or so .

When I bought a webcam , I was initially going to go with the c922 , but after watching reviews ended up buying the $T$  which sits in the same price bracket . That one might be worth looking into ! :) I have had no issues with the camera at all and am very happy with the quality . It has an inbuilt ring light which does a lot to improve the lighting on my face .

$T$   RULES !!! Undoubtedly the best food , second to none - in price , taste , choice , and quality . However its restaurant " environment " is nothing to speak of , - it is what it is . No servers , you place your food order and pay for it standing at a window , you pickup the food at a second window , and you eat it on a picnic table under their roofing , or you
