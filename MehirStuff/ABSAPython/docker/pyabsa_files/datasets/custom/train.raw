Quick sanity check - I switched to Red Pocket  ( AT & T ) from my Verizon plan . I bought the sim card and the monthly plan from the Red Pocket  site . I now want to buy the annual plan from eBay . Will I have issues adding the 12 month plan to my existing account at $T$  ? Please and thank you .

For me personally , I would definitely have to recommend $T$   for anyone who hasn ’ t watched it . Hands down one of the craziest things I ’ ve ever seen , and I ’ m still shocked all of this actually happened and I had no clue about it lol . It ’ s a limited series documentary on Netflix based on a controversial cult leader ( Rajneesh ‘ Osho ’ Bagwan ) who builds a utopian city in the Oregon desert , and shortly after conflict ensues with the locals and his followers which escalated into a national scandal . Found it to be extremely compelling , don ’ t want to say to much and ruin the gist of it but I highly recommend giving it a go if you haven ’ t already !

For sure . IMO $T$  has a more well rounded lineup than Fiesta Texas  , but Fiesta Texas is a better looking park . Too bad FT forgot the shade . I ' d rather have Shock Wave than Superman , Mr . Freeze than Poltergeist , Superman than Scream ... Wonder Woman has no comparison , but both parks have a Freespin , a Discovery , a Batman Clone , a Pandemonium , a Hybrid ( I rank them pretty evenly , Rattler is too short to be better than NTG ). Also despite Road Runner Express being a better coaster , Runaway Mine Train is well themed and has massive historical value . La Vibora , Titan , and Judge , also have no comparison to any rides at Fiesta Texas .

There is really no difference in 99 % of places . Verizon is not really that much better than T - mobile   in a lot of places but they go by the Apple philosophy of charge more and people assume that means higher quality . The caveat to that is more rural areas or off the beaten path in places like that you will likely find some better than others . I work on a concrete building that gives a lot of people issues and my work is not far from a concert venue and my  T - mobile  has SO many less issues with the building than people paying more for $T$   or Verizon and when a concert is going on people I work with that have those tend to see their service more bogged down from the crowds than mine ever has . A lot of money is spent making people think one is going to be better than the other in a big metro area or along a massive interstate , but rarely have I actually seen that be the case .

You could try Black or White . An issue that a group of people have with the games is that it doesn ' t have Pokemon from older games present through the main story but since you ' re new to the franchise , that ' s not really a big deal . After that , assuming you enjoyed either game , you could move on to Black 2  or $T$  ( sticking with the same color for story reasons ) which * do * feature older Pokemon throughout the main story .

Sprint not only has significantly less coverage , but their coverage also only goes up to 3G . Sprint doesn ' t have 4G or LTE coverage in Hawaii yet .

Best was Gen 5  . it really was an amazing Generation . $T$ had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   Let ‘ s Go  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks . Though , from the live - streams I watched , SwSh are just embarrassing and low effort products .

An      $T$  from a community college before transferring to a university is not a bad way to go , especially if you use a lot of AP and early enrollment credits from high school . It can save one a lot of money . They transfer really well to the state universities , actually having the associates degree ( as opposed to just a bunch of credits ) helps with making sure that all the credits are accepted as transfer . But doing it because of indecisiveness or to anything beyond an associate ' s degree is never a good move .

The XR I have now I guess . I was late to the party . I have used Apple computers since the Apple IIe I had as 7 year old , but when the iPhone came out , I was still into my Blackberry . I experimented with Android breifly ( ugh ) and then  Windows Phone , which I loved for 3 - 4 years . I would have honestly stayed with  $T$ and I wish Apple would copy some of it ' s UI ideas tbh , but it tanked . I finally jumped ship and got a 5S . After that a 6S plus , 8 plus and now the XR . It wasn ' t until the 8 plus that I had a camera that I felt was as good as the Nokia Windows Phones . It took me some time to warm up to iOS , but I have and Apple continues to make great improvements to it . My XR is my favorite so far , but it has a few limitations . Main reason I went with it is the XS Max was as big as my 8 plus , which was too big for me and the XS didn ' t have the battery life I wanted . The XR ' s cheap price made it an easy decision and it ' s been great . I think I ' ll probably get a 12 Pro next provided the battery life is up to par .

I ' m curious about this " party " thing with $T$ . There are subreddits set up for joining Visible parties . Some of them have more than a 1 , 000 people in them . Is there any downside to being in such a party ? Can the other people in the party bug you or bother you somehow ? If there ' s no real downside to being in a party of 1 , 000 random people , it seems the $ 25 / month price should be reflected prominently in the spreadsheet somehow . This price makes the service *** very *** attractive .

I know acetaminophen / paracetamol does and $T$ doesn ' t , but I can never remember with naproxen and ibuprofen . Aspirin is the only one that seems to work for me anyway , so I suppose it doesn ' t matter , but I like to know .

It ' s the same as elementary statistics except with calculus ; you need to apply the right concepts at the right time . Also , be open to do programming as that will give you even more job / internships opportunities . $T$ and Python are probably the top two . You can look up " probability theory " to see what calculus plays a role in statistics , that course is the toughest one for most Stats programs .

Meal prep . I suggest a breakfast burrito  . I do a tortilla , egg whites , low fat cheese , salsa , and spinach one . Sometimes you can add a meat like sausage or something . Cook and prepare , put them in the freezer and take one out the night before and pop it on the microwave for 60 seconds before you leave . I also suggest oatmeal . Portion it out in a to go container or do the instant if you need to . Pour hot water in it , go brush your teeth or hair or whatever and it ' s done . Sometimes I add a little peanut butter . If you have more time than that on your hands you can ' t go wrong with eggs . $T$  , add some cheese or something and add hot sauce for more flavor . 5 minutes .

Best was Gen 5  . it really was an amazing Generation . BW1 had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   $T$  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks . Though , from the live - streams I watched , SwSh are just embarrassing and low effort products .

I ' d say my best hotel experience was at $T$        . My friends and I decided to go all out and go 5 star for a holiday the year out of school . Our amazing stay started off rocky though and what really made it great was their problem solving . We booked our holiday the week after schoolies and when we got there the schoolies had damaged the room and stretched a used condom over the smoke detector . We called the reception and let them know . Asking if they can give us a different room . The manager himself came to our rescue and was very apologetic . We got VIP treatment and a room upgrade . From a normal room straight up to the top floor penthouse at no extra charge . We got all the extras you get when you actually pay for that room . Essentially got 6 days free since we didn ' t get charged for the difference so that was the best hotel experience ever for a bunch of 18yr old .

I ' m curious about this " party " thing with Visible . There are subreddits set up for joining $T$ parties . Some of them have more than a 1 , 000 people in them . Is there any downside to being in such a party ? Can the other people in the party bug you or bother you somehow ? If there ' s no real downside to being in a party of 1 , 000 random people , it seems the $ 25 / month price should be reflected prominently in the spreadsheet somehow . This price makes the service *** very *** attractive .

The XR I have now I guess . I was late to the party . I have used Apple computers since the Apple IIe I had as 7 year old , but when the iPhone came out , I was still into my Blackberry . I experimented with Android breifly ( ugh ) and then  Windows Phone , which I loved for 3 - 4 years . I would have honestly stayed with  Windows Phone and I wish Apple would copy some of it ' s UI ideas tbh , but it tanked . I finally jumped ship and got a 5S . After that a 6S plus , 8 plus and now the XR . It wasn ' t until the 8 plus that I had a camera that I felt was as good as the Nokia Windows Phones . It took me some time to warm up to iOS , but I have and Apple continues to make great improvements to it . My $T$ is my favorite so far , but it has a few limitations . Main reason I went with it is the XS Max was as big as my 8 plus , which was too big for me and the XS didn ' t have the battery life I wanted . The XR ' s cheap price made it an easy decision and it ' s been great . I think I ' ll probably get a 12 Pro next provided the battery life is up to par .

Meal prep . I suggest a $T$  . I do a tortilla , egg whites , low fat cheese , salsa , and spinach one . Sometimes you can add a meat like sausage or something . Cook and prepare , put them in the freezer and take one out the night before and pop it on the microwave for 60 seconds before you leave . I also suggest oatmeal . Portion it out in a to go container or do the instant if you need to . Pour hot water in it , go brush your teeth or hair or whatever and it ' s done . Sometimes I add a little peanut butter . If you have more time than that on your hands you can ' t go wrong with eggs . Scrambled eggs  , add some cheese or something and add hot sauce for more flavor . 5 minutes .

The XR I have now I guess . I was late to the party . I have used Apple computers since the Apple IIe I had as 7 year old , but when the iPhone came out , I was still into my Blackberry . I experimented with $T$ breifly ( ugh ) and then  Windows Phone , which I loved for 3 - 4 years . I would have honestly stayed with  Windows Phone and I wish Apple would copy some of it ' s UI ideas tbh , but it tanked . I finally jumped ship and got a 5S . After that a 6S plus , 8 plus and now the XR . It wasn ' t until the 8 plus that I had a camera that I felt was as good as the Nokia Windows Phones . It took me some time to warm up to iOS , but I have and Apple continues to make great improvements to it . My XR is my favorite so far , but it has a few limitations . Main reason I went with it is the XS Max was as big as my 8 plus , which was too big for me and the XS didn ' t have the battery life I wanted . The XR ' s cheap price made it an easy decision and it ' s been great . I think I ' ll probably get a 12 Pro next provided the battery life is up to par .

Best was Gen 5  . it really was an amazing Generation . BW1 had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   Let ‘ s Go  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks . Though , from the live - streams I watched , $T$ are just embarrassing and low effort products .

I wouldn ' t exactly say " significantly " with T - Mobile   . I ' d say their coverage spread is about 70 - 75 % of AT & T   ' s and Verizon ' s . T - Mobile   ' s network is excellent when you have access to it . Sprint not only has significantly less coverage , but their coverage also only goes up to 3G . $T$ doesn ' t have 4G or LTE coverage in Hawaii yet .

You could try Black or White . An issue that a group of people have with the games is that it doesn ' t have Pokemon from older games present through the main story but since you ' re new to the franchise , that ' s not really a big deal . After that , assuming you enjoyed either game , you could move on to $T$  or White 2  ( sticking with the same color for story reasons ) which * do * feature older Pokemon throughout the main story .

And ibuprofen is not one of the NSAIDs that will fuck up your liver if taken with alcohol ? I know acetaminophen / $T$ does and aspirin doesn ' t , but I can never remember with naproxen and ibuprofen .

Quick sanity check - I switched to $T$  ( AT & T ) from my Verizon plan . I bought the sim card and the monthly plan from the Red Pocket  site . I now want to buy the annual plan from eBay . Will I have issues adding the 12 month plan to my existing account at Red Pocket  ? Please and thank you .

Best was Gen 5  . it really was an amazing Generation . BW1 had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And $T$ had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   Let ‘ s Go  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks . Though , from the live - streams I watched , SwSh are just embarrassing and low effort products .

There is really no difference in 99 % of places . Verizon is not really that much better than $T$   in a lot of places but they go by the Apple philosophy of charge more and people assume that means higher quality . The caveat to that is more rural areas or off the beaten path in places like that you will likely find some better than others . I work on a concrete building that gives a lot of people issues and my work is not far from a concert venue and my  T - mobile  has SO many less issues with the building than people paying more for AT & T   or Verizon and when a concert is going on people I work with that have those tend to see their service more bogged down from the crowds than mine ever has . A lot of money is spent making people think one is going to be better than the other in a big metro area or along a massive interstate , but rarely have I actually seen that be the case .

The XR I have now I guess . I was late to the party . I have used Apple computers since the Apple IIe I had as 7 year old , but when the iPhone came out , I was still into my Blackberry . I experimented with Android breifly ( ugh ) and then  $T$ , which I loved for 3 - 4 years . I would have honestly stayed with  Windows Phone and I wish Apple would copy some of it ' s UI ideas tbh , but it tanked . I finally jumped ship and got a 5S . After that a 6S plus , 8 plus and now the XR . It wasn ' t until the 8 plus that I had a camera that I felt was as good as the Nokia Windows Phones . It took me some time to warm up to iOS , but I have and Apple continues to make great improvements to it . My XR is my favorite so far , but it has a few limitations . Main reason I went with it is the XS Max was as big as my 8 plus , which was too big for me and the XS didn ' t have the battery life I wanted . The XR ' s cheap price made it an easy decision and it ' s been great . I think I ' ll probably get a 12 Pro next provided the battery life is up to par .

Yeah hard agree on that ... my takeaway is that SFA is decent for what it is and doesnt deserve all the ire it gets , but I ' d go to KD for Dominator and TT anyday . $T$ has much nicer landscaping and scenery too .

when you feel it coming on , get a minimum of 1000 mg of vitamin C  , 64 oz of $T$ , and 8 hours of sleep a day . within 2 days the early symptoms subside and you will have fought off the cold .
