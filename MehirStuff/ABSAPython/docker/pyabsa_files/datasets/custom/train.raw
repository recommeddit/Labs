Best was Gen 5  . it really was an amazing Generation . $T$ had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   Let ‘ s Go  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks

I use $T$ . Automatic categorisation would be nice , but since I import every two weeks , it ' s not too much of a hassle to manually go through them since there aren ' t that many .

You could try Black or White . An issue that a group of people have with the games is that it doesn ' t have Pokemon from older games present through the main story but since you ' re new to the franchise , that ' s not really a big deal .

An      $T$  from a community college before transferring to a university is not a bad way to go , especially if you use a lot of AP and early enrollment credits from high school . It can save one a lot of money . They transfer really well to the state universities , actually having the associates degree ( as opposed to just a bunch of credits ) helps with making sure that all the credits are accepted as

When I bought a webcam , I was initially going to go with the c922 , but after watching reviews ended up buying the $T$  which sits in the same price bracket . That one might be worth looking into ! :) I have had no issues with the camera at all and am very happy with the quality . It has an inbuilt ring light which does a lot to improve the lighting on my face .

Cook and prepare , put them in the freezer and take one out the night before and pop it on the microwave for 60 seconds before you leave . I also suggest oatmeal .

Best was $T$  . it really was an amazing Generation . BW1 had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   Let ‘ s Go  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks

Admob is certainly the easiest to integrate . Mopub is a decent alternative . Amazon ads  are okay , with the plus side that you do not have to rely on Google Play Services as you do with $T$ . I would probably just go with Admob due to its ease of integration .

You could try $T$ or White . An issue that a group of people have with the games is that it doesn ' t have Pokemon from older games present through the main story but since you ' re new to the franchise , that ' s not really a big deal . After that , assuming you enjoyed either game , you could move on to Black 2  or White 2  ( sticking with the same color for story reasons ) which * do

I wouldn ' t exactly say " significantly " with T - Mobile   . I ' d say their coverage spread is about 70 - 75 % of AT & T   ' s and Verizon ' s .

Sprint doesn ' t have 4G or LTE coverage in Hawaii yet

For me personally , I would definitely have to recommend $T$   for anyone who hasn ’ t watched it .

There is really no difference in 99 % of places . Verizon is not really that much better than $T$   in a lot of places but they go by the Apple philosophy of charge more and people assume that means higher quality . The caveat to that is more rural areas or off the beaten path in places like that you will likely find some better than others . I work on a concrete building that gives a lot of people issues and

Admob is certainly the easiest to integrate . $T$ is a decent alternative . Amazon ads  are okay , with the plus side that you do not have to rely on Google Play Services as you do with Admob . I would probably just go with Admob due to its ease of integration .

You could try Black or $T$ . An issue that a group of people have with the games is that it doesn ' t have Pokemon from older games present through the main story but since you ' re new to the franchise , that ' s not really a big deal . After that , assuming you enjoyed either game , you could move on to Black 2  or White 2  ( sticking with the same color for story reasons ) which * do

I wouldn ' t exactly say " significantly " with T - Mobile   . I ' d say their coverage spread is about 70 - 75 % of $T$   ' s and Verizon ' s . T - Mobile   ' s network is excellent when you have access to it . Sprint not only has significantly less coverage , but their coverage also only goes up to 3G . Sprint doesn ' t have 4G or LTE coverage in Hawaii yet

Yes , the $T$  is stronger than most of the HP Envy devices out there . The Legion 5 15 "    is a bit more powerful but has a shorter battery life . It could always go on sale later on , but I don ' t know for certain .

I have often had to defend my love of $T$  and his music to friends and co - workers who ' s best argument is " he just looks so nasty and sleazy ". I often point to things he has done and said that seem to suggest that he is a down to earth , " good " person . I am glad a few people can share the sentiment and at least one redditor can attest to the fact .

It ' s the same as elementary statistics except with calculus ; you need to apply the right concepts at the right time .

Best was Gen 5  . it really was an amazing Generation . BW1 had the biggest roster , forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story . And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion . Worst . From the games I played , definitely the   $T$  games . They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on . Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks

There is really no difference in 99 % of places . $T$ is not really that much better than T - mobile   in a lot of places but they go by the Apple philosophy of charge more and people assume that means higher quality . The caveat to that is more rural areas or off the beaten path in places like that you will likely find some better than others . I work on a concrete building that gives a lot of people issues and
