I recently bought $T$       for € 4 . 99 . The bottle is very similar to Dior Sauvage  and I read on some forums that the perfume is infact a cheap dupe of Dior Sauvage . I have only smelled Dior Sauvage once when I gifted a bottle to my brother but I really like the smell and performance of the Lidl fragrance . I ' ve been meaning to ask this in the Newbie tread but has anyone

I ' ve honestly had more problem on two phones in the last two years ( flagship phones from $T$ , too ) with USBC than I ' ve ever had with microusb . I have a suspicion that the female port needs to be made of harder material now than previously , since a bit of stress will expand it and make it harder for the plug to stay in , which the asymmetric old cables don ' t suffer from .

An      $T$  from a community college before transferring to a university is not a bad way to go , especially if you use a lot of AP and early enrollment credits from high school . It can save one a lot of money . They transfer really well to the state universities , actually having the associates degree ( as opposed to just a bunch of credits ) helps with making sure that all the credits are accepted as

We went to the $T$   ( Cancun ) a couple years ago and it was truly all inclusive . We arrived late , around midnight , so all the regular restaurants were closed . We ordered room service , which was no cost . They have 11 restaurants , and indeed they aren ' t always open all at once , but at least 6 - 8 are open at any time of day . Alcohol available all the time , minibar included

Are you sure that $T$  doesn ' t have level scaling ? Because Underground 1  does . I used to have trouble beating the later races . One advice on the internet that worked was to remove every upgrade you can , and the other cars will also be slower , making the game easier . Also , I bought the Corolla GTS as my starter car in Underground 2 . It ' s the worst car in the game , and the first

Haha , I was an EE major but in my first $T$ lab I drew a picture of knuckles from Sonic using javaFX . The prof gushed how he used to play sonic with his son and showed me a bunch of emulators . Ever since then he would make an effort to show me interesting stuff that was out of the curriculum . He gave me no choice but to switch to CS . Also , does your dean serve as an advisor ?

$T$ is a solid wood coaster and probably the only thing you ' re missing out on .  Green Lantern sucks and there is a much better 4D coaster that is open and Viper is your typical Arrow looper . It ' s fun but a bit rough . It ' s also supposed to be open again soon so maybe you ' ll get it .

How is that a bad thing if the patriots get players for cheap and still win ? And quit acting like the 80s NFC was miles ahead of the 2000s AFC . The 2000s AFC had $T$ , the great Ravens defense , the great steelers team , and along with the Pats dynasty there was the Chargers who have 2 potentially 3 Hall of Famers all on the same offense . It is indisputable that the salary cap makes it easier to win ...

$T$ albums are better than gold , they ' re magic . The fact that he doesn ' t get more exposure really makes me question people ' s judgement . Seriously . The production , the lyricism , the fact that he ' s deep without going pretentious .. He was a genius .
