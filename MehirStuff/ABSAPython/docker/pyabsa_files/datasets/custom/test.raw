And ibuprofen is not one of the NSAIDs that will fuck up your liver if taken with alcohol ? I know acetaminophen / paracetamol does and aspirin doesn ' t , but I can never remember with naproxen and $T$ . Aspirin is the only one that seems to work for me anyway , so I suppose it doesn ' t matter , but I like to know .

Yes , the $T$  is stronger than most of the HP Envy devices out there . The Legion 5 15 "    is a bit more powerful but has a shorter battery life . It could always go on sale later on , but I don ' t know for certain .

Meal prep . I suggest a breakfast burrito  . I do a tortilla , egg whites , low fat cheese , salsa , and spinach one . Sometimes you can add a meat like sausage or something . Cook and prepare , put them in the freezer and take one out the night before and pop it on the microwave for 60 seconds before you leave . I also suggest $T$ . Portion it out in a to go container or do the instant if you need to . Pour hot water in it , go brush your teeth or hair or whatever and it ' s done . Sometimes I add a little peanut butter . If you have more time than that on your hands you can ' t go wrong with eggs . Scrambled eggs  , add some cheese or something and add hot sauce for more flavor . 5 minutes .

I have often had to defend my love of $T$  and his music to friends and co - workers who ' s best argument is " he just looks so nasty and sleazy ". I often point to things he has done and said that seem to suggest that he is a down to earth , " good " person .

in my opinion odyssey isn ' t worth the money , I would recommend witcher 3  , $T$   , Spider - Man   , Batman games  , AC origins  .

( Southern ) United States - $T$ , eggs , hash browns  , sausage , toast , pancakes , and fully loaded grits   . Yes , some people eat all of this . What I have listed is not a menu , but the contents of one meal . And let me tell you , if you eat all of this for breakfast , you won ' t need any other food for the day .

When I bought a webcam , I was initially going to go with the c922 , but after watching reviews ended up buying the $T$  which sits in the same price bracket . That one might be worth looking into ! :) I have had no issues with the camera at all and am very happy with the quality . It has an inbuilt ring light which does a lot to improve the lighting on my face .

Fwiw , Kate also seems to have a similar layout and function set to $T$  I haven ' t exactly a / b compared them , but they ' re both very rich in features and fairly easy to figure out

Matthew Hayden  , Bill Lawry  , Don Bradman  , Ricky Ponting  , Steve Smith  , Keith Miller  , Adam Gilchrist  , Ray Lindwall  , Shane Warne  , Dennis Lillee  , Glen McGrath  . Gonna be tough to beat , though if someone were to cook up a Windies all time XI itd probably come bloody close . EDIT : Gordon Greenidge  , Desmond Haynes  , George Headley  , Vivian Richards  , Brian Lara  , Garfield Sobers  , Jeff Dujon  , Malcolm Marshall  , Michael Holding  ,  Joel Garner , $T$  . Annnnndd now I ' m dying to see these two teams face off in a series .

It ' d probably be $T$  from HBO ' s series [ The Neistat Brothers ]( http :// www . hbo . com /#/ the - neistat - brothers ) Well ... I ' m biased because he ' s actually a friend of mine . Here he is [ icing me ]( http :// i . imgur . com / ZEQJK . jpg ) after I had gotten him with a good set up earlier . All around nice guy , great stories , full of great advice / wisdom . A good guy . I forgot to mention how nice of a guy Van is too . He stays in NYC for the most part , though ... I don ' t get to see him much . Genuine , nice fellow .

Meal prep . I suggest a breakfast burrito  . I do a tortilla , egg whites , low fat cheese , salsa , and spinach one . Sometimes you can add a meat like sausage or something . Cook and prepare , put them in the freezer and take one out the night before and pop it on the microwave for 60 seconds before you leave . I also suggest oatmeal . Portion it out in a to go container or do the instant if you need to . Pour hot water in it , go brush your teeth or hair or whatever and it ' s done . Sometimes I add a little peanut butter . If you have more time than that on your hands you can ' t go wrong with $T$ . Scrambled eggs  , add some cheese or something and add hot sauce for more flavor . 5 minutes .

It ' s the same as elementary statistics except with calculus ; you need to apply the right concepts at the right time . Also , be open to do programming as that will give you even more job / internships opportunities . R and $T$ are probably the top two . You can look up " probability theory " to see what calculus plays a role in statistics , that course is the toughest one for most Stats programs .

Yeah hard agree on that ... my takeaway is that $T$ is decent for what it is and doesnt deserve all the ire it gets , but I ' d go to KD for Dominator and TT anyday . KD has much nicer landscaping and scenery too .

How many missions is $T$    and how representative is it of the full versions of the game ? I ' m interested in buying it to play with my girlfriend to test the waters for frosthaven but wondering if you could give some insight

I use $T$ . Automatic categorisation would be nice , but since I import every two weeks , it ' s not too much of a hassle to manually go through them since there aren ' t that many .

Beats solo 3   and studio sound very good for the price . And $T$   sounds good full stop . " beats = bad " has become a meme in itself

Thanks ! Made it easy to narrow down my options by requirements like international calling and unlimited data . Ended up going with $T$  despite it not being on the recommended list - any reason , in particular , it isn ' t recommended ?

I would put UT Austin  and $T$  higher but other than that I agree with this list more than any other ranking list . That being said , I don â€™ t really know a ton about every school so I can â€™ t really say this with certainty .

For sure . IMO Over Texas  has a more well rounded lineup than $T$  , but Fiesta Texas is a better looking park . Too bad FT forgot the shade . I ' d rather have Shock Wave than Superman , Mr . Freeze than Poltergeist , Superman than Scream ... Wonder Woman has no comparison , but both parks have a Freespin , a Discovery , a Batman Clone , a Pandemonium , a Hybrid ( I rank them pretty evenly , Rattler is too short to be better than NTG ). Also despite Road Runner Express being a better coaster , Runaway Mine Train is well themed and has massive historical value . La Vibora , Titan , and Judge , also have no comparison to any rides at Fiesta Texas .

Yes , the Swift X  is stronger than most of the HP Envy devices out there . The $T$    is a bit more powerful but has a shorter battery life . It could always go on sale later on , but I don ' t know for certain .
