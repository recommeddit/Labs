"Yeah, it really is telling. No MCU movie gets criticised this much to the point that if you praise it, you get downvoted. But oh well, hopefully one day they'll get over it..... Maybe not. It's actually funny to see people get all upset about this. I love it."
"You can definitely find companies in the US that have a great work/life balance and offer plenty of vacation. Especially in the tech field. I work for a software company (as a techie) and have 6 weeks of vacation (30 days) and work 40 hours a week other than rare occasions. Seattle meets most of your requirements except for healthcare (though again, the right company will have good benefits there too)."
"The trick is to undercook the egg. It's going to continue cooking in the bowl while you assemble and cook a little more when you reheat it. 

I really need to make a big batch myself soon."
Kourtney is my fav because I appreciate her authenticity. Khloe has unfortunately become my least fav because of her bullying / negative attitude.
Did you remove the clear plastic sheets on both sides of the back? That's most likely your problem.
Have you tried Waiakea?
"Its articles like this that can really screw vulnerable high school kids up.  Lets say little Timmy is a flamboyant theater junkie, and has big dreams of being a Broadway star.  Little Timmy is going to read articles like these and decide to become a chemical engineer, even though he really dislikes science.  Fast forward 15 years, and Little Timmy is standing over the dead bodies of his wife and 2 children while turning the gun over on himself.  Kids, let this be a lesson to you.  
**Do not be like little Timmy.**"
"I wish zebra had a setting to show all updates in the changes tab. Thereâ€™s a tweak for Cydia and thatâ€™s the only feature I miss. 

That and a dark zebra icon, I love the little animal one but itâ€™s bright ðŸ¦“"
"I work for a company that builds and installs industrial equipment all over the U.S.  They send me out for all kinds of reasons (watch something get installed, diagnose a problem, talk to a client, run equipment and take data) you name it.  I'm have a unique position at the company in that I'm versatile in my knowledge and willing to go anywhere, so there's always something they want me to look at."
"Mostly because that's all late composers, and community orchestras - or at least the ones I've seen/played in - only very rarely do they play anything later than Dvorak. Generally you're stuck playing the contrabass part at best if you're in an orchestra. 

The one and only thing our orchestra has played out of that entire list is Mussorgsky, night on bald mountain. And I wasn't there for it - it was ten years ago. Though we did play Jupiter a couple of years ago. Yay, orchestra tubas? We just got our director to green light sorcerers apprentice... which has bass clarinet and contrabassoon awesomeness. 

Trombones don't get the best treatment in orchestras either. 

Cello parts are great from Baroque to modern, meanwhile. You're never going to have a bad part."
"I read it for a paper my junior year and I also thought it was a great leg up when I took quantum afterwards, because it explained entanglement very nicely."
"Take sensible precautions just like any city, and you will be fine. The drug cartels stay out of tourist areas because its where they make their biggest business. As for ethical questions having to do with resorts--yeah they probably aren't the best option for the local economy. In these massively scaled up tourist areas (of which Cancun might be the largest I've seen at least), there are plenty of barriers to entry into the market to keep competitors out that might pay better wages.  If you want to be safer and remain in a tourist area but get out of Cancun, Tulum is a nice alternative."
"Well yes, but swap Rice for most Super Bowl winners' starting QB and they're probably in trouble, so I'd argue that's a bad criterion, unless you think the top 30ish players all time are Super Bowl winning QBs"
"My mother and wife got the 11 and love it. It really is the best phone for most people. Unless size, screen, or an extra camera is something you need, the 11 is an amazing phone.

And for reference, my mother had an iPhone 6, my wife an iPhone 6s Plus."
"In simulation/building games, Apple Arcade Outlanders had me hooked from the first to the last level."

Incredibly original movie"
"Most Unix systems have perl.  The `perl` package has prename (which at least Debian symlinks `rename` to).  That gives you a vastly-more-powerful-than-wildcards feature where you can apply Perl expressions to each filename that you want (and use whatever crazy features your shell has to select the files to operate on).

Eg.

    $ rename s/foo/bar/ *.jpg

will change ""foo"" to ""bar"" in all your .jpg filenames in the current directory.  You could ROT-13 encode, change the case of, modify file extensions, etc on your files.

Also, if you use emacs, and you use emacs's file browser, `dired`, you can use `M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode`, which makes your dired buffer editable as a text file.  When you're done, you just hit `C-c C-c`, and the changes to filenames are applied.  Gives you all the functionality of emacs to do renames."
Where did you get it for under $100?
I've been using [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) for a while now and enjoy it a lot!
"Iâ€™m not sure how poor is extremely poor, but they do sell generic toothpaste at most dollar stores which for the volume is about as cheap as baking soda."
"I'd say LinkedIn is a minimum requirement but even then not necessary. 

I like Twitter for networking with developers of projects I'm interested in. Any way you can get your name out there, the better."
"Thanks! I thought Iâ€™d combine my love for Stravinsky with Twoset ðŸ˜‚

Sorry, I saw someone else say it and I thought it was a good way of describing the instrumentâ€™s popularity/necessity. I just meant there was more competition basically."
