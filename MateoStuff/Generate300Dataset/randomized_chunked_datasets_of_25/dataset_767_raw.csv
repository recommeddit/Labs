I’m very happy with the PITAKA MagEZ Case 2 on my 13 Pro Max.
"Someone with exquisite taste, that isn't afraid to stand out. Someone that like to challenge themselves and others. An individual that from a fragrance perspective like to sink themselves into the notes and dissect them. It would be easy to guess female, but could just as well be male, based solely on the fragrances. I am guessing an educated individual, maybe even an academic. I am guessing there is a playful aspect to their personality that is allowed to roam free from time to time, but overall, my guts tells me this is a person that likes control over themselves and their environment."
"Some countries still have water towers made of asbestos.

Does asbestos from water towers contaminate the water? Is there a suitable filter to remove it?"
"I would have said Linux Mint until recently, but they dropped their KDE version, so I'd be just as inclined to try Kubuntu as I am Mint.

If you're coming from windows, KDE will have essentially zero learning curve(You might want to disable the silly single click to activate instead of double click thing though.)

Don't let anyone tell you that you need to use Arch or some other ""Do it yourself"" distro to ""learn"".  If you want to take a deep dive into how Linux fits together, then absolutely go for it, but if you just want a usable platform for daily use, there's no shame in staying with Ubuntu derivatives.

There's a lot of things to learn, and obviously someone's gotta learn all the greybeard Linux wizardry, or we might not have Linux at all.  But at the same time, there's other stuff to do.

Especially as a programmer, who might just want the OS to work so they can focus on application software."

"DO YOU READ SUTTER CANE?! So beautifully done. I love the Lovecraft vibe and references. Fuck it, everything John Carpenter should be on this list."
"Hey kids, today we're going to talk about..."
Yeah but I am a badger fan and he was incredible in all the games he played. Almost defensive rookie maybe?
"I'm not unsure though.  All of my sales reps (GE, Frigidaire/Electrolux, Bosch/Thermador, Whirlpool/Amana/Maytag) stated that their lifecycle is ~7-10 years.  This is largely due to using lower quality parts, and more electronics which add to points of failure, lowering their life expectancy.

This doesn't mean that you're losing money by buying newer appliances that won't last as long.

For example, say you get an old fridge for $500 that lasts 20 years but costs $80/yr to run.  Over that period, you'll spend $1600 just on operating the unit, so $2100 over the life cycle of the unit.  If you get a newer fridge for $500 and it costs $45/yr to run, but it will only last you 10 years, you're spending $950 over the life of that unit.  To match the lifespan of the older fridge, you'll have to buy another one at $500, and spend an additional $450 over the next 10 years, giving you a total cost on the newer unit of $1900, saving you $200 over the 20 years.

As you said, you're talking about experiences you've had personally with units that are 20 years old.  I'm talking about hundreds of appliances I've sold, as well as the life cycle projections from the manufacturers, on units that are new.

Just because the statement isn't as clear as you'd like doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about."
I’m from Ohio too!
"CS major about to graduate here. Math and science needed in the major are the basics (up to calc 3 and electricty/magnetism/1 chem class). Any other math you do is specifically tailored for the major (numerical methods, algorithms, lambda calculus) and that's the extent of those subjects I've had to deal with. Each university is different but I feel it shouldn't stray too far from this."
"I like the cello, violin, and piano but I also enjoy the harmonica and bagpipes, not together of course."
[Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X6VoFBCE9k)
"Tom Holland is undoubtedly the best. Give that a watch and post back here with your opinion. I'm pretty sure you'll feel the same way. All the adjectives you used to describe Maguire, Holland pulls it off better imo."
"Everytime I restore rootfs I add back all my repos, about 60 of them, to Sileo all at once.  Not sure why you don't have that feature."
"The only celebrity I've ever met is Bill Murray

He made a joke I didn't get at the time and gave me wrong directions to the Asia exhibit inside the Dallas Museum of Art

10/10 would ask Bill Murray for directions again"
"This poll definitely has the right direction given it reflects the Mitch poll's system. It also seems to do a good job of getting a mix of the US and worldwide coasters. However, I can tell that at least so far, it's suffering from a big lack of support for the smaller parks. 

I've seen several examples of high tier rides that have ranked severely below the supporting lineup coasters from the high visited parks. While I'm sure more ballots and support over time will correct this, there should be some weighting to ensure that Cedar Point and Kings Island's coasters don't dominate over everything. I've read a little into Coaster Bot's methodology and he clearly lies out the challenges faced with this. It's been a while, but IIRC, the Mitch Poll did compensate in some way for lower ridden rides.

I don't want to seem to critical, since Coaster Bot works hard at what he does, and is one of the better coaster content creators around. While the statistics are always interesting, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on this year's results until we see if next year's seem to be more accurately reflected."
Not be sure if someone mentioned it but “the blacklist “ is an awesome show
"I never owned the old one, but apparently durability is the biggest change."
"> tried to get that video removed from the internet

Now, that's just not a good idea."
"It’s only a good gift if the person receiving it is the type of person who gets massages. If she’s never gotten a massage, she won’t start because you got her a gift certificate. Same thing with manicures and other stuff. Some women are into it, others are not."
A lot of people think California is just LA and the bay area. Neglecting the ridiculous amount of other interesting places this state has.
"I had a friend in a college class who told me a story that he was vacationing with rich friends, who were renting a house, and the Kardashians were renting the adjacent house. He could have been making it up, I guess. He said Kourtney and Kim were super sweet, super tiny and I think he said Kim was prettier in person, all things I’ve heard said before."
Small market teams don't get the credit.
"YES ! When I say I have a $1k budget, I want to spend $800 not $1200 lmao."
