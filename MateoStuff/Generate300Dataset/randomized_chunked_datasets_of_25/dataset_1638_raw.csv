"Thanks, I'll consider them for next time. I don't recommend the second one though, since it only has a 768p display."
Any mice in particular to look out for?
I can't wait to hear what the 10th dentist of reddit uses.

"I totally agree. Who we need are people who live & love what they do!   


A doctor isn't just an 8-5 job, it's a way of life. People must remember that Doctors are part of the front lines who are willing to make the right call in the given situation. It's more than a grade, but a person who is willing to put others first and I am determined to.  


 I will remember why, because I want to help others and that's my reason I will persevere. I will give this all onto God and Christ and they will bear my strength into super human energy!"
Why is Compton the odd one out? Nearly 6000 runs at above 50 puts him right among the very best batsmen to have played for England.
"And PLEASE don't give bath items if you don't know whether they can actually use them. There are exactly two brands of body wash I can use without feeling like my skin is on fire, and lotion is hit or miss. If they have sensitive skin or they're allergy-prone, go for something else."

"My favorite is Opera, but use Firefox at work. I like Opera due to the built in dark mode, vpn, and ad-block and the fact that is relatively lightweight (compared to Chrome). Use Firefox due to being easier to run than Chrome and it is pretty much our standard. Used to use Chrome but it got quite heavy and once I switched, I realized how little I liked the design and feel of the interface. I still have it installed, but don’t really ever use it anymore. Tried Edge but just felt a bit incomplete. That being said, I have not tried the new Chromium version yet. For old stuff (Windows 98SE) I have been using Seamonkey, albeit an older version, because it works. I avoid Internet Explorer and Safari at all costs."
"Yelling ""Leerooooy Jeeeenkins"" is kind of a cliche, especially with it's notoriety outside the game. I find myself quoting this video *far* more often, it just has better snappy quotes that fit more situations.

"Illmatic is known for being simply a tight, well-rounded hip hop album rather than an influential one."
"If I’m feeling sweet - Dolce & Gabbana Pour Femme. Powdery raspberry marshmallow but it’s very soft and airy.

If I’m feeling floral fresh - Roses de Chloe. Smells like dewy pink roses.

Floral fresh but with a sweetness - Gucci Bloom, the original one. Such a pretty, pretty fragrance. Definitely my favorite out of all these three."
Interesting. And you didn’t love the GPW?
[How about this military surplus Swiss Engineer Rucksack for $20?](http://www.keepshooting.com/swiss-engineer-rucksack.html) I ordered one earlier today actually.
My problem is that Smith chromapop plastic lenses scratch so so easily. Haven’t tried glass chromapop. Though these are the best lenses I’ve ever looked through and I own three pairs.
