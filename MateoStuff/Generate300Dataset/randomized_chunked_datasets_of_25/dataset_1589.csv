52882,best hiphop album,Yeah no doubt. I love what he did with modern production sensibilities on KOD and kind of made them his own in a lot of ways. It's a big departure from his more typical sound and the flows show cased he has way more range than hes shown. Really well executed concept album. I'm just a sucker for  those strings and horns and all the singing/harmonies. Beautiful
20358,best workout music,"Hahaha yeah I get that. The only person I can play nightcore around is my sister and that’s only because we like to have crazy car dance parties. Personally, I love blasting it in the car, especially on long car trips!"

16761,best pet for toddlers,"IMHO it depends on the kids.  I've known families with breeds not normally recommended for families (Afghans, Irish Terriers, Malinois) and it worked out great because the parents were smart and dog savvy and raised nice, dog savvy kids.

And even the nicest dog can bite if the kids are allowed to run roughshod over the dog and he finally hits his limit.  I think many dogs should be put up for sainthood but it should never be allowed to get to that point."
