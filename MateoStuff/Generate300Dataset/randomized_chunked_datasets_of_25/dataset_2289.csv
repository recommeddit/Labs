17489,"1. Pascal s' Wager - I really like this game. Originally developed for the mobile platforms, but the game feels like a console game. It's a souls like, but much much easier (except the final boss). The world is dark enough, lot of upgrades for characters, and more cool things. This game has 2 main DLCs, the first not too fun, but the Tides of Oblivion adds a new chapter to the game. I hope in the near future we got new chapters, finally the multiplayer mode, a resolution boost (for the A14 and M1 devices), and an announcement for the sequel/ a new cool game from the developers. /
2. Grimvalor - This game is from the developers of Swordigo. Can i say more? Really fun platformer hack&slash, i buy'd 3 times (Android, Switch, Ios).",best iOS game

36221,"I work in a nightclub in the UK, not really a ""Bartender"" how you have one in mind, but I pull pints, make the very odd easy cocktail, but mainly its spirit and mixers or bottles. 

Me and a couple of guys had the night off, and got some drinks vouchers. We got a bit drunk and them and decided to start buying random drink, we ended up mixing spiced rum and amaretto. Honestly, it tasted like Christmas, normally I HATE amaretto, but it tasted so nice in the mix.

We worked out (like it took much working) that it was best in 2:1 of rum:amaretto, with coke on top. Its simple to make, but just give it a go. We all thought it tasted like Christmas, but we were all also rather drunk. 

Next one, Turbo Shandy, if you want to get drunk, quick, and on something that tastes alright, grab one of these. Get a bottle of beer, a bottle of smirnoff ice/wkd ice/vk ice etc mix them together and shove a shot of vodka in them. Works errryyyy time",best alcoholic drink
