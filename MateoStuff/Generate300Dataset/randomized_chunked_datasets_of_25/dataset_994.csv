23032,"I used to work for a company that had celebs, most musicians, come through our office on a regular basis. Most were just regular people, but a couple stick out.

George Clinton (yes my name is pfunk so this one was special to me) was amazing. He was playing at our yearly company conference and if you volunteered to set up you got to meet him. I volunteered every year and out of everyone he was the best. Most did the regular meet and greet thing, smiles, pictures, autograph, not GC. He showed up early and spend almost 4 hours with the 20 or so of us. Just awesome.

Garth Brooks - came into the office for a meeting with our CEO one morning, then spent the rest of the day shooting the shit in the breakroom. His manager asked him a few times to get going but he wasn't leaving till he had answered every question and signed every autograph. I wasn't a big fan, but he was a legit great guy.

Will.I.Am - dude was really nice and crazy smart.

Fergie - told me I was cute in front of my then girlfriend, now wife. She hates when I make her confirm that to people.",best celebrity

67022,"> Have you ever been to a Boogie? 

I was an organizer for the WFFC in 1996 and 1997. I lived on the DZ in ZHills for about 5-6 years and participated in every boogie, to include just being at the Turkey Meet last Nov. I have been an organizer at 6 different DZ's over the last 25 years. 

You ever been to the WFFC? You ever organized at a boogie? You have an AFFI rating?

>  What dz is dropping formation loads with jumpers who don't know they are on a formation load?   

Never said 'formation load'. I sad that at many boogies the pilots are talking and will start jump run and drop jumpers while the last load is landing. You never been to a boogie when a group is landing and another is on jump run? Maybe you have not been to a real boogie?",best places to skydive in california
