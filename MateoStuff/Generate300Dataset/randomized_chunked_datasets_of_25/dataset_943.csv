55567,best action and adventure novel series,"If you're reading it for the first time as an adult, I'd have to disagree. Most people read it as a kid, and as children's lit it's just fine, but I don't see how it has much appeal to adults aside from nostalgia. (I'm reading them for the first time as an adult, myself. Although I'm only in book 4, so that recommendation really only applies to the first three.)"

44836,best items under $100,"And replace them every few years 

You breathe, sweat, drool, spread skin dust and sebum on them. They actually weigh more after some use.

So yeah, buy good pillows, but realise they are consumable items, with a finite lifespan 

(Washing can help)"
21060,best workout music,"Well, I really like Eluveitie but that might not be to everyone's tastes. They have hurdy-gurdy solos. But Everything Remains As It Never Was is worth checking out if you've never heard them before.

I've really only been rekindling my love of metal recently due to Spotify, so I am not very up to date, and I like loads of stuff that is probably not well respected :)

From  folk-metal perspective, as I say check out:

* Korpiklaani - Manala is a great album to start with
* Ensiferum - Unsung Heroes and From Afar would be worth trying
* Eluveitie - Everything Remains As It Never Was, Slania, Helvetios
* Finntroll
* Skalmold - saw them support Finntroll, were very good
* Tyr - didn't flick my switches but a lot of people like them
* Turisas - ditto
* Dimmu Borgir - ditto


For general metal I really got into Trivium, who I gather a lot of people dislike, but I genuinely think Shogun is a fucking brilliant album, and In Waves is great too.

Mastodon obviously, Crack the Skye in particular.

Septicflesh - The Great Mass was very good.

I really like Skindred, have done for years, one of the best live bands ever. You will either love them or hate them though.

Machine Head - I had Burn Your Eyes on cassette back in the mid 90s, was very happy to rediscover them! The Blackening and Unto the Locust I really enjoyed.

Killswitch Engage is always good really good gym music obviously.

Any suggestions for me? Especially on the folky/vikingy side?"
46116,best trick or treating candy,"I dunno, we got one house on our street who leaves their lights on intentionally to get kids to come to their door so they can tell them that Halloween is evil.

11640,best gifts for dad,"I made him a list of his most common phrases in Spanish so he can communicate the way in his own idiosyncratic way with the maid.  For example, as a former infantryman he would always say ""The world is my latrine"" (Todo el mundo es mi baÃ±o.)"
5904,best programming language for web development,"Every computer language have some importance in some form or another form, it depends upon you which computer languages you want to learn, for example I belong to a non programming background so I am more comfortable in learning languages which are more theory oriented like Python and MySQL, mainly I learned about the computer languages like MySQL and JavaScript. 
So you can choose whichever language you want to learn but I want you to go for MySQL because it is used by over all 5181 companies like Uber,  Airbnb, Netflix, Pinterest, Shopify, Amazon, Twitter, Udemy and many other companies. So you can go for MySQL. 
There are various platforms which provides you the outline for learning, I would highly recommend you to use Edu4Sure, because there are many less online platform which includes practical learning, and Edu4Sure is one of them. I have also learned MySQL from there only. It was really a helpful online certification course provided with updated content and an experience of learning from the experts. So if you want you can learn from there. 
I wish you All the best for your future."

I did enjoy Antartica though."
