"I do agree that weekly downloads don‚Äôt really tell the whole story just like open issues, number of commits, etc. don‚Äôt either. However, despite criticisms of the management of `axios`, I think it is safe to say that it is still widely used and alive as ever."

HA.
"Ooh thanks for the heads up, I have chronic hives and since spring my sinuses swell overnight (causing post nasal drip). I've been taking an awful lot of antihistamines lately and recently my skin, hair and eyes are so dry and tight, i wonder if not drinking enough water is the reason."
Only El Toro?
"Screen protector wise I always go for the Spigen EZ ones now with full coverage and the fancy installation tray.

Case I love the Apple leather but no bottom protection turns me off, I was looking at the Nomad leather"
"I seemed to hit a ceiling where I couldn't progress fast at all. I don't remember the trophy count, somewhere between 8k-10k trophies I think. I had 4-5 or more brawlers over 500 trophies etc.

I kept getting stupid team mates that would stand around or leave etc. It was a frustrating time. I could do solo brawls and get trophies but I had to play meta champs if I wanted to play to win."

Same. Usually lime flavored sparkling water is over powering with lime flavor

"I mean, Khloe has gone through shit yet she seems somewhat empathetic. 

People don‚Äôt see Kylie as traumatised. They see her as someone who is very out of touch (e.g mink slippers) and never seems happy and extremely co-dependent. If she hates the fame she could easily move away and stay low-key (see: Blake Lively, Eva Mendez for example), but she likes the $$$ and she‚Äôs never had a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life so it‚Äôs not that simple for her."
Ann Leckie is awesome.
"Persol is a decent middle ground between the two (I find most Ray Bans to be quite bland), and can be had for ~120-150 on Amazon. Of course, they're all the same company..."
"Asics have really wide toe boxes and come in EE widths. New Balance also has shoes that come in widths but they feel just a touch narrower than Asics.

I currently alternate between NB Minimus and NB 1080v2; both in EE width."
Churchill overall. In the United States I'd go with James Madison or Abraham Lincoln
I was fortunate to work on a film with Danny Trejo. At lunch he told us stories about growing up in East LA and his time in prison. Really really cool down-to-Earth dude.
"Hi,

What would be the best monitor to purchase that meet all the requirements : 

* G-sync
* 240HZ 
* IPS Panel
* RBG 
* 1440P
* 0.1-1MS response time

I've been having issues finding one. I was checking out the [Predator XB3](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/predator-model/UM.HX3AA.X05) but found out it's only ""G-SYNC Compatible"" which ended up making me cancel the order after finding out the difference in an actual G-sync module chip compared to g-sync compatible. 

Thanks!"

"I have a 10 year old small chest freezer. I also have a meter that measures how much juice any appliance uses. I threw it on the chest freezer for 30 days. It used up 20 KWH. Since my cost around here is about .10 per KWH, that comes out to about $2.00 a month. I lose more than that in change out of my pocket every month. Have fun."
