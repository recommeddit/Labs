The Grand Canyon. You could a whole Vegas/West Coast thing at the same time.
"Archer, for sure. One of my all time favorites"
The newer defender feels more like a commuter with port covers.  Doesn't have the integrated screen protector anymore and edges are shorter.
"To be fair, we wouldn't have to act superior if everyone would just realize that we are better than them /s

Actually a CompSci major though, I haven't noticed this. Maybe I just dont get to know enough people."
Just finished this and the first and second season were spectacular
"If you are content by yourself and are very independent.  I think it is great for saving money fast.  After all, freedom is bought."
"Trying to decide between the iPhone 11 and Pro right now. Not sure how I feel about OLED I wouldn't say I need it, but the extra battery life from it would be nice and my main reason for upgrading. Don't really need the extra camera, and the smaller size would be nice since i'm upgrading to get rid of the 6s+ size I have right now, but i've also heard it's ""too small"" as well. Seems to be bigger than my relatives iPhone 6 tho and that's what i'd consider too small these days."
"or still supporting IE11.

**Edit:** come to think of it, that does count as doing something weird."
One of the best.
"Grew up in Missouri and Silver Dollar City was the summer amusement park for me. Sure, Disney and Universal can be fun, but if I’m choosing, I’m going to SDC. And maybe catch a show at the Stampede."
I’m still in high school and just starting out. I use Brackets.
That's literally the best one I ever had but the price kills me
"Wild Things and Crying Game

Just so many in those movies"
"Brother in law is a pilot who gets occasional celebs on charter flights. His go to answer is Henry Cavill's dog. (Henry Cavill ranks close second, due to his willingness to let flight crew pet said dog)"
"To be honest: Hotel Victoria in Paris. It was a 2 star place with tiny rooms, but it was central, reasonably affordable, quiet and had a great bed."
"I know what you mean when you say it's 100% preference. I had used regular dome keyboards for probably 15 years so when I researched the different mechanical keys by reading about it, I thought for sure I'd like red or browns the best. That being said, once I actually felt the red and brown key switches, I hated it. They were far too soft with no tactile response which I didn't like at all. After much more research I settled on clear keys and am more than happy about it. So to OP, all you can really do is try some out at your nearest pc place and find what you like best for your needs."
I had a kayak but if not I would use a solar panel.
"Ahh I should have worked that out haha sorry, thank you friend I will see if I can pick one or two of them up!"
"Nah, as a student and as a researcher, it's impossible to ask every author whose work you cite or reference in your stuff. I'd spend all of my time contacting people instead of actually doing real work. Everybody I've talked to [in academia] is fine with sci-hub and uses it themselves. In the end, the authors of this stuff don't care where you get their paper from, as long as it's cited formally and appropriately. It does far more for the author than wasting their time contacting them personally or getting it from the publisher - imagine if everybody across the globe asked individual authors for a copy of their paper, who has the time for that?"
Well I am a nothing gets done kind of guy.
"God Emperor of Dune (but really the whole series)

The Hyperion Cantos

The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"
"Mont Blanc - One Legend. 
Almost always get compliments on this one when going out."
Try edge or opera
1 Pint of Caffreys Irish Ale
Dan Carlin is the Man!
