"IA is about on-par with MN for charging at least for Teslas. And worrying about fast charging availability is a gas engine habit/worry. You'll no longer be 100% dependent on someone else for range. 95% of the time I rely on my garage. That's no small benefit. Over time the whole ""I can fill a tank in minutes"" feels to me like a cheap part trick or consolation prize for all the things my old ICE vehicles couldn't do that my Tesla can."
You take your suit as carry-on. I've never been question when I bring a suit-bag in addition to my carry-on
"I prefer SiteGround. Good packages, fast support, nice and efficient."
"My 4 inch memory foam mattress topper. 

Being I can’t work due to health issues (28 years old) and we live paycheck to paycheck. So getting a new mattress wasn’t gonna happen. 

Around that time was my birthday and an Amazon gift card $100.  

I found one that had good reviews. It was about $75 I think. 

Before this I got one of those cheap thin ones that lasted a few weeks tops.  

But this one.  It’s so good. I HIGHLY recommend getting one that’s at least 2 inches thick.  

We spend so much time sleeping.  And how we sleep Will always affect our lives.  Our general mood. Health.  Work.  Interacting with people. Everything. 

I’ve had it about 4 years now and it’s basically the same as the day I got.  And that carries a lot of weight because I’m in bed like 90-95% of the time because of all my heart/lung issues."
Watch it buddy! I'm very happy with my orange living room!
"With parental supervision I agree. A betta fish is as good as you're going to get for a beginner pet. They're still a lot more work than most people think, as well as more delicate , so I'm always hesitant to recommend them."
Did I stutter? ;)
Not one of the ingredients you listed is actually in a Milk Dud.

Yes!   I just installed these in my place a few weeks ago.  Everyone’s sleeping better.  Best money ever spent!

Have you played Soda Dungeon 2? I got kinda burnt out on 1 and haven't bothered with 2. I'm wondering if there' enough new stuff to make it worthwhile
"Look up the Congo Crisis, one of the most messed up series of events in recent history. On June 30th 1960, Patrice Lamumba and the Congo get independence from Belgium. Within a matter of days, his army mutinies, the country is reinvaded by Belgium, and three of his most important regions secede. Being that the Congo has tons of uranium, the US, CIA Russians, Cubans and the UN send their troops and resources. See if you can guess how things end up for Lamumba..."
Tom Ford Black Orchid and (surprisingly) Noir Tease from Victoria's Secret!
"Out of the resort hotels I've only stayed at Cabana Bay, but I absolutely loved it! The 50s/60s theming is amazing, it has a lazy river, two big pools, bowling, an arcade, fitness center, etc. It's definitely not a fancy hotel, more casual, but a really great value for your money. The best part is the proximity to Volcano Bay, you can just walk over there."
"Official Apple Leather Case (in black) on my graphite iPhone 12 Pro Max.

I used to use the black one for the iPhone 11 Pro Max and decided it was worth a shot again since the thing never shows signs of aging (in my use case). Most colored leather ends up fading to a much darker color anyways and ends up looking bad (except for the saddle brown, that thing ages like fine wine as it darkens), but the fading doesn’t even show up on the black, so it always looks pretty new. Plus it feels super soft yet somehow grippy.

It’s great."

Thanks for your hard work. But the repo (antique repo) for [[Crash]] doesn’t work since many times. If you can add a link for direct access.
Well *I've* just added it to my watch list!
Ahhh...thanks for the condensed version...great tip--I have a lot of painting projects around the corner!
