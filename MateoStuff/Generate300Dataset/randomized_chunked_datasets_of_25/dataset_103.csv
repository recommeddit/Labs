22823,"Met Johnny Depp and didn't realize it until the next day, and he was awesome and shook my hand and everything.

I was at Comic Con and saw an amazing Captain Jack Sparrow. I complimented him because his costume looked exactly like the one from the movie. He replied by shaking my hand and then asking me, in the perfect voice ""What costume?"" and then swaggering off with the same sort of walk he used in the movie. I thought I had just met the best cosplayer ever, then I saw on the news the next morning that Johnny Depp had been at the convention walking the floor in the original movie costume.

If somebody offered me a beer I didn't like, I'd just say no thanks, but I guess he felt like he was owed the particular beer he liked. I asked what beers he'd prefer, and why, and he couldn't even articulate what he liked about other beers, he just felt insulted at the free beer being, in his mind, cheap.

Edit- Now that I think of it, I'd met him once before that, and got into an argument with him over what ethnicity I am. Guy's weird.",best trick or treating candy
