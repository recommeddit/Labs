69640,"It really depends on your school and how much work you're willing to put it. If you get research positions, that can easily translate into research jobs after graduation, without a master's degree. That's what my friend did. I also have my psych degree, and I work for a non-profit in my area of interest while preparing to go back for my masters. Many of my classmates went into marketing and consulting (we went to a very business-minded school). So it really depends. I'm honestly so sick of this stereotype. My psych classmates have all been very successful so far, some advancing their degrees, some not.

Edit: Psych is also a huge field. Figuring out what area you want to work/specialize in will help you be successful.",best major to study in college

41461,"Well, for starters we prefer to be a little more professional than playing some casio that fits in a backpack at real gigs, and furthermore I imagine that's only 2-3 octaves which severely limits your playing ability compared to an 88 key. I also assume your keys aren't weighted.

Also, it still doesn't matter if we don't have power, which is roughly 50% of our gigs. Your backpack keyboard speakers aren't keeping up with several guitars and voices. 

Edit -- woops, didn't realize which comment you replied to. If you've ever backpacked before you realize how much space *any* keyboard takes up. It would be horribly inconvenient to backpack with a casio keyboard.  

Plus then you have to worry about batteries and keeping the thing from getting wet or too dirty. Plus I just dislike playing non-weighted keys.",best instrument to play
