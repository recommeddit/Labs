58232,best cologne,"Speaking of Tom Ford, Black Orchid is the absolute best night cologne I've ever smelled."
69640,best major to study in college,"It really depends on your school and how much work you're willing to put it. If you get research positions, that can easily translate into research jobs after graduation, without a master's degree. That's what my friend did. I also have my psych degree, and I work for a non-profit in my area of interest while preparing to go back for my masters. Many of my classmates went into marketing and consulting (we went to a very business-minded school). So it really depends. I'm honestly so sick of this stereotype. My psych classmates have all been very successful so far, some advancing their degrees, some not.

Edit: Psych is also a huge field. Figuring out what area you want to work/specialize in will help you be successful."

5943,best programming language for web development,"That's more than just syntax, it's inefficiencies which over enough repetitions or in the wrong place can lead to extremely slow code."
41461,best instrument to play,"Well, for starters we prefer to be a little more professional than playing some casio that fits in a backpack at real gigs, and furthermore I imagine that's only 2-3 octaves which severely limits your playing ability compared to an 88 key. I also assume your keys aren't weighted.

Also, it still doesn't matter if we don't have power, which is roughly 50% of our gigs. Your backpack keyboard speakers aren't keeping up with several guitars and voices. 

Edit -- woops, didn't realize which comment you replied to. If you've ever backpacked before you realize how much space *any* keyboard takes up. It would be horribly inconvenient to backpack with a casio keyboard.  

Plus then you have to worry about batteries and keeping the thing from getting wet or too dirty. Plus I just dislike playing non-weighted keys."

38697,best newspapers to read,"Murdoch likes his political influence more than the tits he prints in the Sun, so much so he [operates the Times at a loss](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/jan/15/newsinternational-rupert-murdoch) and I haven't heard that this has changed since 2010. Though I think it's rather unfair to dismiss a paper because of its owner, I've always found the times coverage reasonably sane (at least compared to other newspapers)."
