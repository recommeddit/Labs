Thanks for checking out my post. I'll try your quiz now.
"Nike Pegasus are also 20% off at Nike, they last long and have great comfort and protection."
"I tend to agree with SU&SD more on this one. Terraforming Mars is, to me, a pretty mediocre engine builder, with a good bit of luck determining who does well. Shut Up and Sit Down has a razor-sharp focus on finding the ""hook"" or the really unique game concept that makes the game a keeper. Terraforming Mars' ""hook"" isn't a mechanic or game element, it is the science-oriented fantasy of slowly carving an entire planet to your will. I think that appeals to a lot of people, including many reviewers, but I think SU&SD would say that the emperor has no clothes."

"If you don't even bump your dependency library versions (i.e. `node-fetch`), it's going to get stuck behind in major versions.

e.g. `node-fetch` is on v2.6, but in `isomorphic-fetch`, the version specified by `""node-fetch"": ""^1.0.1""` EXCLUDES any 2.0 version of `node-fetch`. Now *that's* horribly outdated.

Yes, it's essentially a single line package, but if you wanna use and/or write a package, doing it this way is just begging for security holes."
">You should 100% watch Unicorn (the 7 OVAs, not the 22 episodes) after Char's Counterattack then, but other than that solid plan!


Oh yeah i definitely won't be done with Gundam after UC lol, ty for recommendation. 

>Commie's subs for it are solid if you can find them, although their typesetting for the second movie wasn't as fancy as what they'd done for the first one

I'll try and find them. Once again, thanks!"

"I believe Peter F. Hamilton's [The Reality Dysfunction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45245.The_Reality_Dysfunction) is, for all its faults, a prime example of the kind of thing you're looking for. Lots of crazy set-pieces involving space battles, chases, asteroid attacks, onslaughts by legions of the -- ah, you get the idea."
"We bought a whetstone what feels like years ago and it went unused until last week. Everyone in the household is constantly complaining about dull knives and I always tell them, ""well, we do have a whetstone,"" to which they respond ""i DoN't KnOw HoW tO uSe ThAt!!1""

Eventually the dullness started to actually bother me so I spent 30 seconds watching a Youtube video and gave it a crack. Then I learned it had been bothering me my whole life and I just didn't know it. Knives are supposed to cut THAT easily?! Holy crap!"

"> why SU&SD was off the mark?  

I think the key ""tilt"" that SUSD have relative to many other reviewers is the centrality for them of the question, ""is this game a fun way to interact with my friends?"" ie, not, ""is this game a fantastic puzzle to work out (with my friends nearby also working on a similar puzzle)?"" but, is the game good for *enhancing* the interaction between the people at the table?  

You can see this in how strongly they advocate for **Blood on the Clocktower** or **The King's Dilemma** or **Wavelength** or even **Kakerlaken Poker**. Lightweight or heavyweight, all these games are very interactive.  

Terraforming Mars is kinda multiplayer-solitaire-esque. Lots of people really really like games that fit this description, and there's nothing wrong with this type of design. But these games are never going to get a strong response from the SUSD people because that's not where their focus is."

That's mind-blowing to me. Do you work in some archaic industry? I can't imagine developing without basic IDE features.
I have this case currently on my Xr. It’s a great case.
