29994,best money managing app,I use Fudget and Moneylover. Both have a 1 time purchase to remove ads if you wish.
43261,best detective show,"I’m a big fan of Rectify. It’s a nice slow burn - emphasis on the slow but worth it. It’s been a year and I still drift back to it. 

A few long shot suggestions: 

Justified based on the writing of Elmore Leonard on Amazon. Great snappy dialogue about  Kentucky sheriffs. Great villains. There’s an ongoing arch between the lead hero and villain throughout the entire series and they quit before it went bad. 
 
Longmire - modern day cowboy sheriff. There’s Indian mysticism (mysticism not supernatural), political intrigue, and some very interesting characters. If you do get into this, the lead actor was one of the agents in The Matrix - he had a big part and I doubt you’ll recognize him. 

Banshee - this was a cable series. If you get past the premise you might get into it. It’s a tad over the top with out being cartoonish. Guy gets out of jail. Heads to a small town in Philly. Witnesses the new sheriff being killed and assumes his identity. Tried to play on both sides of the law. Lots of intriguing characters. 

And you said you hate fantasy but the setup of the show and the real life making of is too intriguing. Sense 8. 8 people all over the globe are connected mentally that can draw on each other’s abilities in time of need. Not just action hero stuff but medical knowledge and acting. The show is global in scale. Presents 8 completely different characters and storylines. Beautifully filmed and shot. Multiple scenes are filmed 2-3 times as the characters start merging into each other’s lives. All the characters and storylines are gripping. 
Emphasis on the well written stories and characters. If you start this, try to get to the 3 or 4 episode where the gimmick starts happening. If you hate it by that point feel free to bail knowing you have it a fair shot."

8239,best toothpaste,"Not sure about dentists, but I switched to Pepsodent awhile back because it's cheap as hell (89 cents) and I figured ""it can't be THAT bad"".

Holy shit, though, it's the best toothpaste ever.

It tastes like minty Root Beer and (surprisingly) whitens my teeth better than the fucking Crest toothpaste I paid $4 more for."
7811,best laptop for general use,"It is important to keep in mind that not everyone has enough money to afford a decent, new laptop. If you're fine with a used device, used ThinkPads are almost always the way to go. Although they aren't very powerful, they have great build quality. People who are doing general tasks don't typically need much power so an older 4th gen i5 can suffice.

As for my point on SSDs, this is recommended for anyone who buys a laptop with a hard drive. Most people will store the OS on the SSD, then put all other files onto the hard drive, which is why a large SSD isn't typically necessary. 

Almost all laptops these days come with SSDs, so that that point is becoming less applicable over time, but regardless, the point still stands that everyone should have SSDs in their laptop."
