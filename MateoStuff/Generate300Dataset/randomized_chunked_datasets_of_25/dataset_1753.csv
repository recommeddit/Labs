50855,best rap album,1999 is dank
45990,best trick or treating candy,"Pennies, fuck, i used to get pennies, and i hated it... now?  Shit, I'll take  them cents."
51104,best rap album,"Their affinity for British rock acts seems not to stem that far past the Gallaghers and Pete Doherty. If you asked me to guess what the NME top ten would look like, it would look not dissimilar to that.

The real strange thing about NME is their seeming wilful blindness of the UK dance scene, which is really what has been the most exciting pop music movement to come from here since the 90s. Music for the Jilted Generation is somewhere in the 100s but Oasis is in the top 10. No Goldie to be seen."

1611,best ice cream flavor,How much do you put?
17165,best iOS game,"I keep changing. I had a bunch but none of them lasted this long. Always had a few that I went back to like pokemon go, cod mobile and deadcells. I guess you could those 3 are."
11884,best gifts for dad,"Well, that's some pretty expensive beer then!"
30733,best country to live in,Lol the title of the post is asking what the best country in the world is.
24246,best anime,"You may have seen this already, since you have The Cart Driver at the top of your sources, but that blog did something similar to your project back in 2013.

58350,best cologne,*negates rules 1 and 2.
8862,best toothpaste,"huh maybe that's because your toothpaste is prescription. I pulled my tube out and it says

**Directions**
Supervise children as necessary until capable of using without supervision
 Adults and children 6 years of age and older: brush teeth thoroughly, preferably after each meal or at least twice a day, or as directed by a dentist or a physician
Children under 12 years: instruct in good brushing and rinsing habits (to minimize swallowing)
Children under 6 years: Do not use unless directed by a dentist or a physician. Antiplaque and antiginigvitis use not proven in children"
33407,best electric car,"Between the Amazon deal and don’t they have a tech deal with Ford or GM? 

Plus the fact of having the DSM/MMC factory with most of its equipment as a starting point for production. Mitsubishi pretty much just locked the door and left. It only closed in 2015 and Caterpillar has plants in nearby Peoria, so finding experienced workers shouldn’t be hard - especially if it’s a UAW shop.

Tesla had the NUMMI facility but I doubt Toyota and GM left as much in place.

I do think they’ll have distribution problems and they should consider an initial focus on fleet sales. Electric is ideal for last mile puttering around town deliveries. A few contracts with delivery companies could do a lot of good."
55953,best action and adventure movie,Best Marvel movie is The Winter Soldier. Hands down.
15576,best tree for the garden,"If climate doesn't matter, maybe [Copaifera langsdorffii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copaifera_langsdorffii), aka the diesel tree?"
41838,movies like Inception,Dark was really excellent. One of my favourite series of last year for sure.
14577,best romantic novel,"{On The Island by Tracey Garvis Graves} is definitely my go-to for recommendations. I do hesitate sometimes because I’ve seen quite a few posts / comments where people have said they don’t like dual POV books, but I just love that book so much.

Also, I LOVED {One Day In December by Josie Silver} but it’s also dual POV. But I still love it and want to recommend it all the time."
58968,best perfume,"More artisans and small makers in my list than mainstream fragrances, but I hope that's okay, since maybe some could find a new perfumer whose work they enjoy.

* **Barrister and Mann Fougère Gothique** A dirty opening, and then the most lovely dark floral/forest/gravesite drydown ever.

* **Chatillon Lux Weinstrasse** A sun-suffused lazy autumn afternoon sitting in a vineyard, with a field of freshly mown hay across the way. Simultaneously sweet and dry.

* **Hermes Terre d'Hermes** Bright yet earthy; oranges, vetiver, and slate.

* **Southern Witchcrafts Samhain** Boozy pumpkin and tobacco. The aftershave actually smells better to me than the EdT, but whaddya gonna do?

* **Stirling Soaps Port au Prince** Vetiver and lemongrass. Can brighten up Encre Noir or add some depth to Terre d'Hermes, whether in aftershave or EdT formulation. Speaking of which:

* **Lalique Encre Noir** An abandoned church in an old forest. Dark inky vetiver.

* **St. Charles Shave Sandalwood From Wood** A defunct company, so no way to buy more, but damn if this isn't just straight wonderful *santalum album*. Distilled in-house and impossible to replicate 100%, but just lovely. You didn't ask ""what fragrances that I can buy,"" but what my favorite fragrances are. This is one.

* **Hexennacht Ceci N’est Pas Une Pipe** Tobacco leaf with honey and a bit of spiced vanilla.

* **Apothecary's Garden Babylonian Beard Wax** Not an EdP or Edt, but this post asked for favorite fragrances, and this is one. Frankincense and labdanum, with a tiny hint of tonka and the beeswax used in the mixture. Smells like a world-traveling trader may have smelled 2000 years ago, and that's a beautiful thing.

* **Barrister and Mann Hallows** Not-sweet-at-all raw cocoa with dank vetiver and oakmoss. Smelling a cocoa bean whilst walking through a swamp.

Edit: I totally forgot **MPeG Santal Noble**, which I really loved, but haven't smelled the reformulation."
69841,best major to study in college,"Just a word of warning coming from a recently graduated geologist (graduated 2013), if you have the misfortune of graduating during a market downturn things will be really difficult.  My graduating class has about a 25-30% employment rate in our chosen field.  I was lucky enough to know someone in the industry to get my foot in the door, but if I was you I would be networking as best I could during your university years and leave grad school open as an option just in case!

Otherwise, everything here checks out.  Your classmates will probably be a bunch of loveable wierdos who like to drink too much. Your profs will be awesome and field schools are tough work, but a lot of fun.  

Good luck!"
