33577,best electric car,"ahahah, he has no shame."
3875,best online college,"I agree with this as well. I'm currently a full-time student through Arizona State's online program. While I know it's not the most prestigious, it's definitely credible. 

Online was the only format that would work out for me. The closest university to me doesn't offer night classes, plus I do so much better with an online format."
23843,best car racing video game,"I use the right stick for analog acceleration in handheld, and while it's sort of weird it's not too hard to get used to. But I have used a gamecube controller playing docked and the analog triggers work really well. It's definitely the best way to play IMO"

68626,best science fiction novel,"Oh heck. I dunno man lol I hate to tell you to keep going and you don’t dig it. Of course I wanna tell you to keep going but if you’re not interested by now I don’t if it’ll jump
Out and pinch you. I got hooked when they had the mars landing at the beginning. I’m scared to say much more cause I don’t wanna give anything away. Good luck lol. I understand though, if I story doesn’t grab me before I get too deep I’ll drop it."
36335,best alcoholic drink,Yes! I found one that used real orange juice and was under 10$  Weekend made. Have you ever tried mulled wine? Sometimes it reminds me of a warm sangrea with cinnamon.

62024,Best RPG game on PS4,"Here is the problem with Witcher. You must understand the books. Even the first game
carries on after 7th book. To a person who did not read books or not play previous games 3rd title's story might be confusing"

64093,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,MAM doesnt even have much stuff imo libgen and b-ok are better. Private trackers are terrible especially since Bib has stopped taking invites
9731,best dorm hall at UCSB,The only perk of the bathrooms is hot boxing.
31344,best country to live in,"I try to focus on cities rather than countries because some of those factors differ so much from city to city. For example, compare Seattle to where you live now. Same federal government, but completely different story."
63135,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Here found another one samgisaninja.github.io
32750,best vacation resort,"Lots of threads about this on the Trip Advisor forums, so you may want to check there as well. You already have found Secrets the Vine. Also consider LeBlanc, Live Aqua, Sun Palace and Hyatt Zilara. Outside of the hotel zone, look at Excellence Playa Mujeres and Beloved Playa Mujeres.

It really depends on what is best for you. Secrets the Vine doesn't have a swim up bar. LeBlanc probably has the best food, but they don't have full balconies in most rooms and the resort is quiet. Sun Palace has a small pool, and the rooms are not that lux. For me, if I had to be in the hotel zone, I'd pick a suite at Live Aqua. Outside of the hotel zone, I'd pick Excellence if I wanted to party or Beloved if I wanted to chill.

If you really like the Secrets brand, Secrets Maroma is the one you want, but it is a bit farther south. For something less expensive with a fun pool, Valentin Imperial Maya is a great property, but it is a slight step down for food."
34857,best NFL player,"I’ve been very, very happy with the Fitzpatrick acquisition but would not have been sad at all if we drafted Bates. Dude is incredible."
46126,best trick or treating candy,"I think the problem is when they are loose with no packaging, plopped by some guys dickbeaters directly into your bag."
