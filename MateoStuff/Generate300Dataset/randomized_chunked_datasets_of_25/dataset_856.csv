43053,best detective show,"Yes, good for syndication.

Also, they probably have no big bads or anything like that because they have to spend half the time trying to explain the mystery."
25990,best politician,"Towns all over the world are afflicted with piles of excruciating minutia that combine to hinder the overall well-being of the place and its inhabitants, whether it's the condition of the roads, the pH levels of the local reservoirs, excessive light pollution from the factory down the road at times when it isn't even operational, etc.  These are (generally) small things that one person or a small committee can actually change for the better.

Spearhead a campaign for a new park, or a preservation drive for a local nature site.  Ask people in your town or city what bothers them the most, and try to figure out novel ways which require *the least amount of effort from other people in the government as possible* to alleviate or eliminate those issues.

Also keep in mind that you don't need to become a politician to become involved in politics.  If you're truly intelligent, and you have great ideas for how to better a society but don't want to surrender entirely to its political systems, get a degree related to your interests and join a think-tank or NGO that generally appears to follow your own line of morality.

I'm curious, though, as to why exactly you think you'd make a good politician."

47438,best state to visit in the United States,"Yeah, we flew into Denver and it seemed like any other city.

Boulder was cool, but there were still plenty of dicks.

Once we got out of the populated areas it was a whole different story."
26,best terminal file manager reddit,"I don't have a file manager installed. I tried to use `fff`,  `nnn` and `ranger` but I kept always using the basic commands.

When bulk renaming just ls | grep ""something"" | vim and create a bash script which I run to do the work for me. I think ranger does that similar or the same way (?)

Nevertheless. I don't need a file manager, except the one in the browser when uploading files."

68250,best science fiction novel,"* Various - **The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume I** - This book did more to open my young mind to the possibilities of science fiction than any other ten books. A masterful collection of 26 short stories from 1934-1963, by some authors I knew (and some I didn't). I can't recommend this one enough.
* Douglas Adams - **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy** - One of the best comedic novels I've ever read, alongside...
* Connie Willis - **To Say Nothing of the Dog** - Not sure whether I actually laughed out loud more while reading this one or *Hitchhiker's*. I may have to re-read both to put it to the test.
* Walter M. Miller, Jr. - **A Canticle for Leibowitz** - Others have covered this one pretty well.
* David R. Palmer - **Emergence** - The diary of an eleven-year-old genius who lives through a plague, this one has action and characters and problem-solving that just *work* so well for me.

That's five, and I didn't even get to Iain Banks, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Walter Jon Williams, Greg Bear, David Drake...."

50518,best rap album,Fuck i was just about to post this. One of the greatest Hip Hop albums of all time if you ask me.
19894,best workout music,"first off, I recommend everyone to get a premium streaming service, got one a couple of days ago and the way I work out changed completely, it's so incredibly fun! Also, it works perfectly if what you are looking for is new songs in the same style you like to work out or whatever.

In any case I knew a few rap and trap songs that got me pumped but it was through browsing other people's playlists on the app that I got to know random songs that I find awesome to work out.

Some artists like A$ap Ferg, Desiigner or 2pac have a lot of songs that will make you feel great. Try also stuff like ""bitch better have my money"" by Rihanna, or songs by hardwell or kshmr if you're into EDM and it gets you pumped. Also, in rock, I find slipknot, mudvayne and rammstein extremely effective"
