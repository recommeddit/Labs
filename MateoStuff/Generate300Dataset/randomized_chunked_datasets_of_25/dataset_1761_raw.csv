"I’ve grown kind of tired of their style over their releases, I feel like they built a really unique sound on the first record but haven’t really changed much since. They aren't bad by any means, just not top 10 for me."
"I price matched my 32"" G7 to $599 on black friday at micro center.  Definitely the best gaming monitor on the market.   Enjoy.  All the issues you listed with jitter/flickering were fixed in firmware updates.  Definitely just make sure your firmware is updated.

After using this G7, you couldn't pay me to go back to an IPS panel.  The excellent contrast of the VA and glow problems of IPS are a dealmaker/dealbreaker respectively.  I'll keep my G7 until OLED or miniLED become mainstream for monitors.

Both Hardware Unboxed and Rtings.com have the G7 as their #1 overall Gaming monitor and it has been for over 6 months now."
"Lol, yeah, that’s what I just said."
"Hello fellow honeymooner. My fiancé and I are honeymooning in Belize this August. I am in your same shoes and I'll share with you some key tips I picked up from trip advisor and misc. forums. 

I tend to stay away from 'all inclusive' hotels because ""sometimes"" it's a way of getting visitors to stay in an area that's not too popular or is lacking some other thing. Ex. Some resorts offer drinks and all day buffets, but are miles away from any authentic food. Basically eating at any other place is a mission. Eating out is part of the experience and I personally get tired of the same thing everyday. If you're on a budget though, take an all inclusive deal. 

Look at hotel pics on expedia. Stay away from hotels with floral linens, they're washed less because they can conceal stains. If you're looking for good rooms and great service, I must recommend any Hyatt. My fiancé and I stayed at the Hyatt in Aruba, Cancun, San Diego, NYC... the service is consistent and phenomenal. The staff will bend over backwards for you, and the concierge will find you the best possible deal to any 'touristy' thing you want to do, without the fear of getting ripped off by locals.

If you're traveling in October, keep in mind it's hurricane season in the gulf/carribean. Aruba, curaçao, and Trinidad/Tobago are not in the hurricane belt, and have consistent weather year round."
"In my experience, Home Depot has better selection and better prices, Lowes has better customer service.

Sort like the difference in Walmart and Target.

I prefer Lowes, but there is not a HUGE difference between the two."
huh. im surprised he said that. Were you able to screw the hinge screw back in? not saying it's your responsibility to do that but some eye places will do it for a couple bucks
If I ask and show VA id Depot still gives discount to me.  Granted they do exclude a lot of items

"Same here. Love my Nikes (just picked up the Flex 2016 RN), but can't rely on them for actual running. New Balance has always just agreed with me better."
"You can just use gvim for windows, unless there is a pressing need for bash."
Yep! Loving it! I also love that the Wayans Jr is now on New Girl. He's awesome.
This album mad.... But Graduation is my favorite ... Kanye arguably dropped what like 5 classics in a row
100% agreed.
"I'm not sure what would cause a leak, other than someone assembling it improperly. It's a stainless steel bucket, basically, with a filter inside and a spigot for dispensing the filtered water. There are seals on each of the openings with thumb screws to tighten things up. I check mine any time I notice that something is moving that shouldn't be. Just a quick turn of the screw every now and again and I've never had a leak.

TL;DR - I've never had a leak. Basic maintenance is foolproof because there aren't very many parts to begin with."
Yup. I try to be as positively cheerful as possible. “Good morning sunshine!”
Why did this get so many downvotes lol
Time to retroactively cut off your friends and family then /s
"Maybe TI has changed their manufacturing process, but the last time I checked it's the same chip in the CE as the 84 plus, so as a result the CE experiences performance issues.

That said, I havent done any serious research into graphing calculators in about 4 years."
"You also mixed up response times and input lag.

Input lag is the time it takes for the monitor to react to the command and start changing.

Response time is the time it takes for a pixel to change from one shade of a colour to another."
"I prefer warm tones. Right now I use Givenchy Play Intense, Armani Aqua Di Gio Profumo, Ysl La Nuit De L'Homme in edp. Looking for something new, preferably similar to play intense."
"If you are hands-on and prefer a more manual process for setting and tracking your spend then I recommend EveryDollar.  You can even set up sinking funds to manage different cash goals.  I only have 1 savings account, but I have 3 different savings buckets tracked in the app.  I can't use the others like Mint and YNAB because I spend just as much time untracking its automation.  Withdrawing cash from a checking account is not a transaction!"

Mint allows you to create a budget where Clarity Money does not.
Have you tried the Talenti version? It's amazing
