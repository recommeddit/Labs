38047,"He wants to use Wakanda tech to reverse centuries of oppression that's still in many ways happening--he sees race as determinative (as many supremacists do) and insists on his group being the winner.

I mean, it's clearly a comic book take on race relations, but there are parallels between the MLK-style approach to race and the more militant, Black Panther-style approach. It's hard to look at pictures of slaves or Emmitt Till or hundreds of others without at least feeling some empathy for that mindset, even if it's ultimately destructive.",best Marvel movie

That said, as a slightly insane music enthusiast, everyone's getting mix tapes for Christmas. Mom (a country person) is getting four discs worth of music that she's either asked for or that I know she'll like. I'm doing the same thing for my Dad, brother and a handful of my friends. It's something they'll love and get a lot of enjoyment out of, and it's personalized enough to say that I care. Best of all, it means I don't have to spend money that I don't have.",best gifts for mom

My mom said it would be ok to go say hi while all the other kids were getting autographs but I was too scared and thought the other kids were being rude. Finally after he was finished with dinner my mom went over and asked if it would be okay for me to come say hello. Then I saw him smile and wave me over. He was so incredibly nice. He thanked me for being polite and waiting until he finished his dinner to say hi, asked me my name, and then I started crying because I was so nervous and overwhelmed (he was my hero at the time) He just gave me a bunch of hugs and talked to me for a little bit. I didn't have anything for him to sign so he autographed his table cloth(it was paper) ripped it off and gave it to me. I know I met him when I was a little kid but he seemed absolutely huge!",best celebrity

67965,"Another gem from the Warhammer 40,000 library would be the ""Ciaphas Cain"" series by Sandy Mitchell. 

Most stories and games set in the grim darkness of the 41st millennium are about impossibly stoic heroes pitting their impossible stoicism against overwhelming odds to win the day. Ciaphas Cain, on the other hand, is a cowardly, egotistical, largely unskilled Commissar who's chiefly concerned with saving his own skin. Unfortunately, his bumbling obliviousness somehow keeps him coming out on top of increasingly perilous situations, to the point where he's lauded as an invincible hero of the Imperium (and thus, continuously deployed into even greater danger).

A lot of the intrinsic humor in 40K lies in the sheer absurdity of the universe when played straight, but the ""Ciaphas Cain"" novels are the first attempt to do deliberate humor in the setting. Anyone who's seen ""Blackadder"" will recognize parallels straight away, especially in Cain's malodorous sidekick. They're a hilarious take on what would otherwise be the bleak drudgery of the Imperial Guard's lot of being tragically ordinary humans fighting with disappointing technology to survive in a universe of bowel-clenching horror.

Highly recommended for all readers, even those not already familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 setting and lore.",best science fiction novel

I also have Spigen Ultra Hybrid Anti-crack clear case. While the case is great and offer a good protection, the fit is very tight and I’m afraid to scratch the side of my glossy iPhone 12 Pro whenever I put/remove the case. Also the back case is glossy and leaves a lot of smudges and fingerprints. Not recommended.",best iphone case
