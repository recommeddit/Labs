45414,best gaming system,"I went from owning all systems last gen to only PC and Switch this gen

There's nothing non-exclusive that's worth playing on console anymore, there used to be broken PC ports, or fighting games that were DOA on PC, but that's just not the case anymore. The Switch's portability doesn't justify the higher prices and worse visuals and performance, especially since modern phones can run things like Minecraft or Stardew Valley.

Xbox has everything ported over to PC and PS looks like it's going that way too, so there's no reason to buy them at all, hopefully Nintendo follows eventually."

1001,best ice cream flavor,"I ended up getting my wisdom teeth taken out this year and ate a ton of ice cream. I've always preferred vanilla but was convinced I wouldn't be eating mostly soft-solids and liquids for long so I just bought small containers of vanilla. I ended up going through a bunch of brands, most of whom had several types of vanilla each and I found my favorite one of all time. It's Your Churn - Vanilla Bean. If I ever get to choose my last meal for whatever reason, it will consist solely of that fucking ice cream."
