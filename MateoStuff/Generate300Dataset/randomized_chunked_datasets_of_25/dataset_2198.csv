70675,"It's a bit of a stretch and I haven't recently re-watched but basically:

>!You never actually see the cloning machine work. The argument is that he killed off his look alike for real the time he noticed the other guy in the crowd, and everything else is misdirection. You see the multiple hats (something not hard to get a lot of) but never the machine actually working in the same shot. Basically the cloning machine is an extension of the 'light show' of the machine from earlier in the film (lots of fancy effects and then have someone walk out of a different room having been ""teleported""). Plus the flashback shown in the last confrontation isn't set up as a regular flashback, but rather a retelling from an unreliable narrator. And in that hallway you only ever see the one dead man in the tank, when it would have been trivial to show the 'others' to remove doubt.!<

>!In a movie that's explicitly telling you to not fall for the trick and be critical of what's presented to you, it all feels a little suspicious; especially with how they're deliberately not showing you things that would make it absolutely clear. Do you believe the final trick is a literal 1:1 with the birds shown earlier, or that the final trick is being pulled on the audience? (I don't remember exact scenes, but at the time these both made about equal thematic sense)!<

>!And while in the book cloning is actually 100% shown to work, the movie never takes it that far while having a much more grounded story for the first 99% of the run time.!<

>!Basically the whole thing is just that a Nolan movie has an arguably open ended conclusion (\*shocker\*)!<",best movies with a cool twist

As far as longevity goes, getting one of the newer models with the latest hardware should allow your phone to function as long as possible before any issues. I would also suggest that after about 2 1/2 years maybe 3 that you no longer update your iPhone. After a few years those updates can really slow down your phone and make it nearly unusable",best iPhone
