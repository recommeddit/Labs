18499,best YouTube video,"FUN FACT: If you got to the old dead r/reddit.com, I have the 4th highest post and it's a link regarding that video. It's stuck there a part of Reddit history."
6504,best Netflix documentary,That last scene of dont f with cats tho
25391,best cricket teams of all time,"I'm not sure that Australian batting line up can play well in India! Barring Hayden, others sound struggle I think. Even Hayden also had only that one dream tour in 2001 while he didn't perform extraordinarily on other tours to India.
And yeah, Smith to some extent."
68599,best science fiction novel,"Years ago I stumbled upon a pack of ""100 greatest sci-fi novels"" audiobooks. While I don't think the ranking itself means much, nevertheless they are some fantastic books that have profoundly changed my worldview. One of the best decisions I've ever made. Here are some of my favorites in no particular order:

1. Hyperion - Dan Simmons 
This book is way underrated. Told in frame structure about a group of pilgrims travelling to a mysterious planet called Hyperion to meet a creature called the Shrike, the story of each pilgrim is unique and beautiful and impacts me to this day. Cannot recommend enough.
2. I, robot - Isaac Asimov
A history of robotics told through charming short stories. Many really challenge your morals and values as it asks very critical questions - for instance, should a robot hold political power, if they are programmed to do the best for humanity? Amazing, thought provoking book. Nothing like the movie.
3. The Martian Chronicles-Ray Bradbury
This one I also don't see talked about too much, but it's one of my favorites. Again, a series of short stories detailing humanity's discovery of mars and martians. Very unique thoughts behind this one - for instance, what if we finally meet martians, but they don't believe we are aliens? Fascinating read.
4. Rendezvous with Rama - Arthur C Clarke
Classic Clarke hard fiction, a crew investigates a mysterious object flying towards earth. Good old adventure, unraveling the world bit by bit. Definitely takes you to another world and is hard to put down.
5. Enders Game
This was the first book in the pack and started me off on this whole sci fi adventure. This is fairly well known so I won't talk about it too much, but God its an amazing story with amazing characters. The sequal, Speaker for the dead, is very different but amazing as well. Both would recommend."
15074,best romantic novel,Have you read anything else by her? I've been looking at An Unseen Attraction but I'm unsure and audible credits cost £8.

12995,best gifts for mom,"I am knitting her a pair of slippers, and making her a bunch of my homemade bath products. 

I like to make things."
4577,best text editor,"> Actually, it's the other way round - bash uses emacs keys by default.

Yes, of course I understand this, but i was communicating with someone (the OP) likely more used to bash than emacs, as emacs wasn't even on the list of editors."

42203,movies like Inception,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


No for real, spoilers below.


I loved that scene because around that point in the movie, I began to think ""oh great, that's the big twist, we'll find out he's a robot, too.""  I thought I had figured it out and was gonna be bored with the rest of the movie with that cliche ending.  Then the dude slices his fucking arm open to prove me wrong.  It was awesome as fuck and I was hooked.  Fantastic movie."
