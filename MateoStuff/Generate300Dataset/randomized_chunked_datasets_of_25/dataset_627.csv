57072,"It's neat because you probably won't find a human-metabolism-satisfying volume of water that is entirely H2O.

Before you 'Duh' on me, it is usual for H3O+ and OH- to also be present in the solution. Soooo... I don't know if I've ever drank a portion of water that was entirely H2O.

[""In pure water, there is an equal number of hydroxide and hydronium ions, so it has a neutral pH of 7 \(at 25 Â°C\). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value more than 7 indicates a basic solution.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium)

Neat!",best water brand

6644,"See, I switched from Androids to Apple a few years ago, and my iPhone has held up far better than the Androids Iâ€™ve used. 

Iâ€™ve been using the same iPhone since late 2018 with no noticeable decline (slight decrease in battery life, but nothing major.) My Androids of a comprable level (so not the bare bones cheapest ones, but not the most expensive either) struggled to function well once I hit about 1.5 years with them. I treat my phones the same (which is to say, not very well ðŸ˜…) with the same level of daily use, of tossing them around, updating them the same, etc. And so far Iâ€™m incredibly happy with my iPhone, and probably going to get at least another two years out of it before it starts to struggle. The only reason Iâ€™m considering upgrading it at all is for 5G.",best iPhone
