30368,best Mexican war to study,[Heinrich Severloh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Severloh).
37309,best amusement park,"I used them as search topics. For example, if someone searched ""closest amusement park,"" the theme park that pops up on Google results would be considered a search topic.

That being said, I did forget to include Santa's Village in Vermont, and it is the most frequently occuring theme park search topic in that state, so you are correct. I actually have no idea how I got Great Escape, as even SFNE is slightly more popular in VT too."

15836,best sunglasses for fashion,If y'all have Asian face (ie small/non existent nose bridge) I would recommend Covry. They actually fit on my face and the glasses don't hit my chubby cheeks. Arm length could be a bit longer but is a non-issue for the most part. I used to wear Ray Ban New Wayfarers (for Asian people) and the Covry were a nice improvement in fit.
42569,best detective show,You might like Southland. Great but forgotten cop show with the guy from the OC and Gotham.
