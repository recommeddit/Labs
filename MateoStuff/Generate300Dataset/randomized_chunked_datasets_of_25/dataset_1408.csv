55040,I am more hooked to AT and smoky mountain as it looks more feasible economically. I am planning for that. Could you please sent me any other suggestion about the trails and hikes nearby? I tried to search for the spreadsheet you mentioned above but I couldn't find. It would be really helpful if you could direct me towards it. Thank you! :),best places to hike in the east coast

9686,"Aka Santa Catalina, it’s more like living in a hotel versus a “normal dorm”. U get ur own personal bathroom (shared with 3-4 ppl vs the whole floor normally) and live in either a double or triple. Downsides are a 10ish min bike to campus but for me I like that because it’s extra cardio. Portola is the dining common next to it and this year I think it’s easily the best one after eating at it for most of the year. Also look up “dorms” or something along the lines of that in this subreddit and you’ll get lots of threads on this typa thing",best dorm hall at UCSB

18144,"She did deny it on Twitter. I personally think it was half true. Kendall did admit she left and forgot to pay, but said she was apologetic and paid £33 and £7 tip. I personally doubt she apologetic too. She probably frustrated and embarrassed to be called out so publicly (as it was probably a accident) and rushed the interaction. I bet the waitress found her quite rude and hostile, and exaggerated a little in her tweets.",best Kardashian

I was way in the back, and right in front of me was a father and son who I think had lost their own wife/mother, because during the second half of the set the boy started crying and the father was rubbing his back. By the end they were laughing their asses off and gave a standing ovation. Felt very lucky to be privy to that moment.",Best comedy show on Netflix

30384,"I find the topic in general pretty fascinating, and I know a lot of people are going to talk about modern wars, so I'm gonna throw out a few that people might not have thought about.

Alexander's conquests are *amazing* to read about. My favorite example is when Alexander [built a causeway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre) out to the city of Tyre, which was built on an island with walls up to the water. His army hauled stones from the old city of Tyre, threw in the water, and then *walked across to the city,* conquering it. Alexander built an empire to rival *Persia* in 13 years, starting at age 20. That's insane.

Another war (or rather, conquest and the results thereof) that I find endlessly fascinating is the Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan. Everyone is familiar with the Mongol horde sweeping across Asia, etc., etc., but a lot of people aren't familiar with what happened next. On one hand, Genghis Khan was responsible for genocide in the Mongolian conquests. No one debates that. On the other hand, under Genghis, the Mongolian empire promoted religious freedom, positions of importance were determined by merit rather than race or religion, and he essentially formed the nation of Mongolia. Kind of a cool contrast.",best Mexican war to study
37070,"Hersheypark, Knoebels, and Kings Dominion are all great. I still think Busch Gardens is the best choice though. There isn’t a bad ride, the park is clean, it’s completely beautiful, and it’s one of the best park experiences around. It’s honestly my third favorite park, only behind Cedar Point and Dollywood. There literally isn’t a bad thing about the park I can think of. Plus the food is amazing and not TOO expensive. Great Adventure is honestly probably the worst option.",best amusement park

43298,"I think i understand what you mean. Given that most used in-app adservers are Mopub/Admob and they do not offer servicing, i thing you might need a specialized agency that performs both technical integration(of any of the adserver) as well as any kind of servicing you'd need (e.g. campaigns/inventory management). Honestly i dont know any specialized for in-app inventory, but if they sell you anything else then Mopub/Admob (and maybe a few exceptions for some formats, e.g. Fyber or Aerserv) - it would not be nice of them. 

Ah, somewhere in the middle between the 2 (adserver/servicing) might be Pubmatic (which also is a good name, more known in standard display).",best ad service for mobile applications
