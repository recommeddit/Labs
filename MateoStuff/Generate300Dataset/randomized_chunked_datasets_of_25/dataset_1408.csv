66889,best soccer team in the world,Wish it was all time national teams compared would love to see that 2002 Brazil team vs 2010 Spain.
55040,best places to hike in the east coast,I am more hooked to AT and smoky mountain as it looks more feasible economically. I am planning for that. Could you please sent me any other suggestion about the trails and hikes nearby? I tried to search for the spreadsheet you mentioned above but I couldn't find. It would be really helpful if you could direct me towards it. Thank you! :)

9686,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Aka Santa Catalina, it’s more like living in a hotel versus a “normal dorm”. U get ur own personal bathroom (shared with 3-4 ppl vs the whole floor normally) and live in either a double or triple. Downsides are a 10ish min bike to campus but for me I like that because it’s extra cardio. Portola is the dining common next to it and this year I think it’s easily the best one after eating at it for most of the year. Also look up “dorms” or something along the lines of that in this subreddit and you’ll get lots of threads on this typa thing"

But realistically Replica Jazz Club by Maison Margiela"
66574,best soccer team in the world,"The ""new"" galacticos or the ""old"" galacticos?"

18144,best Kardashian,"She did deny it on Twitter. I personally think it was half true. Kendall did admit she left and forgot to pay, but said she was apologetic and paid £33 and £7 tip. I personally doubt she apologetic too. She probably frustrated and embarrassed to be called out so publicly (as it was probably a accident) and rushed the interaction. I bet the waitress found her quite rude and hostile, and exaggerated a little in her tweets."
64085,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,I mean The Eye is somewhat well know and they caused some drama when they mirrored/archived all the content from Bibliotik (private tracker).
64484,Best Nike running shoes,"Yes, I'm excited for NB too! :D"
60731,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I saw Patton Oswalt’s Latest special live, during the taping. I was way in the back, and right in front of me was a father and son who I think had lost their own wife/mother, because during the second half of the set the boy started crying and the father was rubbing his back. By the end they were laughing their asses off and gave a standing ovation. Felt very lucky to be privy to that moment."
72260,best adblocker extension,how hard is it to understand I don't want firefox
72738,best wireless lightweight mouse,"It's quite a different shape, so it's hard to say exactly.
The OOX feels more curved and smaller at the grip, but the hump is a bit bigger and more towards the back."
60023,best perfume,Nemat Vanilla Musk! It's my go-to over most everything else I own which is more expensive
30384,best Mexican war to study,"I find the topic in general pretty fascinating, and I know a lot of people are going to talk about modern wars, so I'm gonna throw out a few that people might not have thought about.

Alexander's conquests are *amazing* to read about. My favorite example is when Alexander [built a causeway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre) out to the city of Tyre, which was built on an island with walls up to the water. His army hauled stones from the old city of Tyre, threw in the water, and then *walked across to the city,* conquering it. Alexander built an empire to rival *Persia* in 13 years, starting at age 20. That's insane.

Another war (or rather, conquest and the results thereof) that I find endlessly fascinating is the Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan. Everyone is familiar with the Mongol horde sweeping across Asia, etc., etc., but a lot of people aren't familiar with what happened next. On one hand, Genghis Khan was responsible for genocide in the Mongolian conquests. No one debates that. On the other hand, under Genghis, the Mongolian empire promoted religious freedom, positions of importance were determined by merit rather than race or religion, and he essentially formed the nation of Mongolia. Kind of a cool contrast."
37070,best amusement park,"Hersheypark, Knoebels, and Kings Dominion are all great. I still think Busch Gardens is the best choice though. There isn’t a bad ride, the park is clean, it’s completely beautiful, and it’s one of the best park experiences around. It’s honestly my third favorite park, only behind Cedar Point and Dollywood. There literally isn’t a bad thing about the park I can think of. Plus the food is amazing and not TOO expensive. Great Adventure is honestly probably the worst option."
62054,Best RPG game on PS4,"Seriously tales of berseria should be pretty cheap these days, and I think its got the best combat in the series."
13051,best gifts for mom,"I bought her tickets to see Cat Stevens/Yusuf Islam in concert. I love buying presents that are an experience rather than something physical, and especially an experience we can share together."
50793,best rap album,Duke Duece wins in all categories.
43298,best ad service for mobile applications,"I think i understand what you mean. Given that most used in-app adservers are Mopub/Admob and they do not offer servicing, i thing you might need a specialized agency that performs both technical integration(of any of the adserver) as well as any kind of servicing you'd need (e.g. campaigns/inventory management). Honestly i dont know any specialized for in-app inventory, but if they sell you anything else then Mopub/Admob (and maybe a few exceptions for some formats, e.g. Fyber or Aerserv) - it would not be nice of them. 

Ah, somewhere in the middle between the 2 (adserver/servicing) might be Pubmatic (which also is a good name, more known in standard display)."
