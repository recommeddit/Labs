10436,best suitcase lock,"> they have in your room still have the default master password/number.

32661,best vacation resort,"Fiji is dirt cheap.

You can get some very very good all inclusive packages at some top notch resorts, but departing from the US could bump the total up somewhat."
46703,best hand santizer brand,"No worries, thanks!!"
38380,best newspapers to read,"In print, I subscribe to the NYT Sunday edition, Wired, Mother Jones, Nat Geo and a local city magazine. All my other subs are online only. I wanna subscribe to The Atlantic, but it’s ridiculously expensive for print imo (and before you ask, the NYT sub was a gift lol). Used to subscribe to the NYer but all the writing started to sound the same after a while and I couldn’t keep up w reading an entire magazine every week. The stuff I read in print is more long form writing; online is more quick-hitter local and natl news."
47045,best hand santizer brand,"This is really cool, they're breeding bugs capable of surviving high temperature, low nutrient, high UV environments.  So basically bugs perfect for space travel."

61814,Best RPG game on PS4,You haven't really beaten the game until you've played through 3 times.  You basically just beat act 1.

19066,best YouTube video,Also Birgirpall  I think Soviet has mentioned them as an inspiration of his. Shame they don't upload anymore though.
32208,best hotel to live in,"Omg another internship story. Different company would send us groups of students and trainees a few times a year. If their founder was in town too he would always try to get keys to one of the girl's rooms. Because ""they're really my rooms"". No, sir. Absolutely not. He tried every time. We would have to staff additional night audit to be stationed on the group floor all night because the GM was afraid somebody would eventually be worn down or scared into complying. Or worse, totally okay with it and not seeing the problem at all.

Don't go on trips for your internships my guys."
7454,best laptop for general use,"Thanks! I actually noticed you had a gaming list right after I posted this & that’s the laptop that caught my eye! I was thinking about getting the 17” version with 1gb sad and 32 go of ram. Is that a good one to look for or is there better options at that price point? Also, is there a big difference between the 3060 and the 3070 to justify the price jump?"
69951,best major to study in college,">I'm fully aware a shit ton of film majors are about to pop up now and shit all over this opinion 

I won't fully disagree with you because in many cases film school is a huge waste. I'm currently a film major so I'm a bit biased but I **will** say that what film school does is give you the opportunity to hone your skills in a competitive but somewhat risk free environment. Basically it allows you some time to really fuck up and make your mistakes before entering the much more competitive real world. It costs a shit-ton of money and the jury's out on whether the investment is worth it but that's a debate that will pop up with many majors in jobs where degrees aren't necessary to succeed. 

What also matters is *which* film school it is. If you're applying to the North Dakota Film Academy in bumblefuck, I would say that it's not worth it. But a well-connected school in or near a major city has a huge upside in that you have so many networking opportunities and a chance to get your foot in the door that you may not have gotten so easily otherwise.

Film school is **not** for everybody and most schools don't have the sort of program that will actually be beneficial. but I think it comes down to financial status, location of the school and what the type of program the school offers."
32229,best hotel to live in,And I've never seen one. How do they deal with them so quickly and effectively?
14598,best romantic novel,"I just finished it yesterday because it's been recommended on this sub so much, and it was the best slow burn. So good."
37423,best amusement park,"Animal Kingdom at Disney World in Florida. People talk about the other Disney parks but sleep on AK, which is easily my favorite"
17894,best Kardashian,"For real...never understood people taking drugs or drinking alcohol being competitive against each other. Kendall is cringe for promoting smoking drugs like it's cool and this person is cringe for gatekeeping weed like it's some sort of cool shit that only real ones does.

I have no problem with people smoking but shut the fuck up about it, don't make this ""a thing""."
64082,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,Completly understandable. I think its a screen lottery. I've heard of people returning 3 or 4 till getting a good one. I was lucky first time. (or my eyes don't detect the lighting shade difference)
51836,best iphone case,"[$12 bumper cases on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Aluminum-Frame-Metal-Bumper-Slim-Hard-Case-Cover-For-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-12-mini-/402570370741?_trksid=p2349624.m46890.l49292) I use that, a skin, and a screen protector. There are a few cheap but good bumper cases on eBay and I’m guessing you’ll find the same ones on Ali Express."
53743,best medicine for a cold,I enjoy a drink when I'm sick but it's not really good for you. It's a little bad for your immune system.
45555,best gaming system,"Wow, that is so cool of you man. I love seeing how the community is rallying to help out a guy who needs it."
36256,best alcoholic drink,I've never seen anyone drink this anywhere but Okinawa but they are delicious.
23395,best car racing video game,I'd say Assetto Corsa Competizione if you want the full sim experience.
1196,best ice cream flavor,"I can't eat real ice cream, but I can eat the coconut milk kind. My favorite is ""Turtle Trails"" by So Delicious. Has balls of dark chocolate covered toffee in it and caramel swirls and it's really, really good. I used to love ice cream but avoided it for years because of allergy, and finding this type was a wonderful thing for a sweet treat now and then."
