Used to subscribe to the NYer but all the writing started to sound the same after a while and I couldn’t keep up w reading an entire magazine every week. The stuff I read in print is more long form writing; online is more quick-hitter local and natl news.",best newspapers to read

32208,"Omg another internship story. Different company would send us groups of students and trainees a few times a year. If their founder was in town too he would always try to get keys to one of the girl's rooms. Because ""they're really my rooms"". No, sir. Absolutely not. He tried every time. We would have to staff additional night audit to be stationed on the group floor all night because the GM was afraid somebody would eventually be worn down or scared into complying. Or worse, totally okay with it and not seeing the problem at all.

Don't go on trips for your internships my guys.",best hotel to live in

69951,">I'm fully aware a shit ton of film majors are about to pop up now and shit all over this opinion 

I won't fully disagree with you because in many cases film school is a huge waste. I'm currently a film major so I'm a bit biased but I **will** say that what film school does is give you the opportunity to hone your skills in a competitive but somewhat risk free environment. Basically it allows you some time to really fuck up and make your mistakes before entering the much more competitive real world. It costs a shit-ton of money and the jury's out on whether the investment is worth it but that's a debate that will pop up with many majors in jobs where degrees aren't necessary to succeed. 

What also matters is *which* film school it is. If you're applying to the North Dakota Film Academy in bumblefuck, I would say that it's not worth it. But a well-connected school in or near a major city has a huge upside in that you have so many networking opportunities and a chance to get your foot in the door that you may not have gotten so easily otherwise.

Film school is **not** for everybody and most schools don't have the sort of program that will actually be beneficial. but I think it comes down to financial status, location of the school and what the type of program the school offers.",best major to study in college
