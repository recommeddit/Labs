26893,"Thanks, I think that's the main reason bgg top looks like it does. People are excited about games and they don't play them enough to see throught their ""cracks"". I think a lot of us has been excited about first games of Catan, Carcassone, TtR etc. But we've played it so much that the ratings dropped. This is not the case with games like Twillight Imperium or Legacy games (because they are designed to be played once throught campaign).",best board games

So I asked her if she wanted me to get her a phone and put her on my Verizon plan and call that her Christmas present. She said yes and is now the happy owner of an iPhone 6+. It ramped up my Verizon bill a good bit, but she's happy.",best gifts for mom
