71356,best movies with a cool twist,But this ignores so much else. He makes eye contact with people constantly throughout the movie.
35919,best alcoholic drink,"Gotta be careful with some of the flavored vodkas as they will have added sugar, Pinnacle, Van Gogh, and Deep Eddy come to mind. 

I'm a big fan of any Stoli or Absolut, mixed with either club soda or water. The new Svedka flavors, pineapple mango and strawberry lemonade mixed with water are delicious."
63649,best books for time management reddit,"I enjoyed ""18 Minutes: Find Your Focus, Master Distraction, and Get the Right Things Done"" by Peter Bregman. It's not just about planning your day rationally, it's more about setting the priorities right. For the day, and for the whole life."
15548,best tree for the garden,Pecan trees produce a huge crop in S Louisiana. People collect and sell them to processing plants in the fall for supplemental income.
12706,best gifts for mom,"A slightly nicer version of something I already own. Like slightly more cushy slippers than the ones I wear every morning. Or simply a new set of the identical ones. The drugstore glasses on a chain, if they're dull and scratched you could buy the same ones new. If I like cats you can donate in my name to the local shelter. 

I'm a human being. I'm alive on the planet. I may be self sufficient but I'm not an inscrutable Other. Chocolates will do if I'm not bummed about weight gain. Movie tickets that I can use when I feel like it. A gift card for a store I already enjoy shopping at. Like Target or Nordstrom Rack. An experience I'd never buy for myself because it's extravagant but would enjoy, like a helicopter tour of San Francisco. 

You could smash the patriarchy. I'd love that. You don't even need to wrap it. Just bring it up casually at the breakfast table. ""Hey Mom, I talked my company into providing parental leave for either parent. Are there any more English Muffins?"" I'd bust out the Marmalade and the Kerry Gold just for that. 

Happy Holidays, remember to love yourselves as I've loved you. And if your actual Mom was crappy, remember to love yourself as your favorite TV Mom would have."
38236,best newspapers to read,"Well, I agree with the previous commenter in that it's well worth reading even if you have a problem with its political bias.  It's just a quality newspaper -- there is a ton of great content that isn't subject to their bias."
46437,best trick or treating candy,"you know what is fucked up? I dont think I ever got an amazing treat. Not even a full sized candy bar. No mythical cans of soda. Back in my day... anything chocolate was the best candy to get. Like those small fun-size candy bars. The worst was those damned mary janes candy and hard candy (cheap assholes who bought hard candy to give out).

But I DID get raisins (fuck you people who give out god damned raisins on candy night!... FUCK YOU TO HELL!)"

62992,Best online React course,"Courses look great, just one thing, why no option for a one time purchase? I’d gladly pay much more for a one time purchase since I only require one course right now. 

But I totally get the reasoning behind a subscription model, it’s just usually they still offer the ability to purchase courses “a la carte”."
44920,best items under $100,"Hey, I was having that thing with my arms and it turned out to be a nerve bulging out from a disc in my neck. I went to PT, learned some posture and stretching/strengthening stuff and I’m well on the road to recovery. 

Not saying that’s what you have, but if it is then leaving it will cause permanent damage."
19145,best YouTube video,"I swear that's the same guy from a ""Try not to laugh"" chain video from ages ago. Gonna try to find it.

Well that was easy. It was the first result (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p32OC97aNqc). Apparently it was an ad for Skype? Dunno. Still pretty funny!"

55375,best action and adventure novel series,"I thought of another rec

Fortunes Pawn by Rachel Bach, it’s a pen name
for Rachel Aaron for her science fiction books. It’s about a mercenary who joins up with a ship crew. Found family and lots of adventures and some romance."

35015,best NFL player,"One thing I hate is when people kind of shoehorn in older players simply for the sake of offering the appearance that they are including all eras but they don't actually do analysis into it.

Like, Lance Alworth is not the 4th best WR of all time. Don't get me wrong he had a great career and is absolutely a hall of famer. But he is not the 4th best WR of all time.

I also think don Hutson gets overrated because of this. Don Hutson is not the 25th best player of all time. Half of his competition was in Germany for his biggest seasons. Like the league was consolidating teams and cutting teams due to a talent deficiency at the time. He was still great and sure you could say he's a top 100 player of all time, but not 25.

My last complaint is that ironically, they underrate Jim Thorpe. Honestly just switch Hutson and Thorpe straight up and it's a much more reasonable list.

Early era players are hard to rate, but I think sometimes they get overrated just so author's can kind of pretend to have this historic enlightenment of the game. The beauty of it is they get to hide behind the ""played in different eras"" argument to avoid actually providing substance to their argument."
