12706,"A slightly nicer version of something I already own. Like slightly more cushy slippers than the ones I wear every morning. Or simply a new set of the identical ones. The drugstore glasses on a chain, if they're dull and scratched you could buy the same ones new. If I like cats you can donate in my name to the local shelter. 

I'm a human being. I'm alive on the planet. I may be self sufficient but I'm not an inscrutable Other. Chocolates will do if I'm not bummed about weight gain. Movie tickets that I can use when I feel like it. A gift card for a store I already enjoy shopping at. Like Target or Nordstrom Rack. An experience I'd never buy for myself because it's extravagant but would enjoy, like a helicopter tour of San Francisco. 

You could smash the patriarchy. I'd love that. You don't even need to wrap it. Just bring it up casually at the breakfast table. ""Hey Mom, I talked my company into providing parental leave for either parent. Are there any more English Muffins?"" I'd bust out the Marmalade and the Kerry Gold just for that.

35015,"One thing I hate is when people kind of shoehorn in older players simply for the sake of offering the appearance that they are including all eras but they don't actually do analysis into it.

Like, Lance Alworth is not the 4th best WR of all time. Don't get me wrong he had a great career and is absolutely a hall of famer. But he is not the 4th best WR of all time.

I also think don Hutson gets overrated because of this. Don Hutson is not the 25th best player of all time. Half of his competition was in Germany for his biggest seasons. Like the league was consolidating teams and cutting teams due to a talent deficiency at the time. He was still great and sure you could say he's a top 100 player of all time, but not 25.

My last complaint is that ironically, they underrate Jim Thorpe. Honestly just switch Hutson and Thorpe straight up and it's a much more reasonable list.

Early era players are hard to rate, but I think sometimes they get overrated just so author's can kind of pretend to have this historic enlightenment of the game. The beauty of it is they get to hide behind the ""played in different eras"" argument to avoid actually providing substance to their argument.",best NFL player
