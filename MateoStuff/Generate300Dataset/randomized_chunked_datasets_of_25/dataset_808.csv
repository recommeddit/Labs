If you think she'd prefer a fine line mechanical pencil that is not necessarily a technical/drafting tool, I recommend looking at a pentel orenz in 0.5. They come in a variety of nice colors she might like too.",best pencil for drawing

I beat the hell out of it and it's still in excellent shape minus a cloth attachment to a zipper pull coming off or something. I actually bought it on the recommendation of my cousin, who is a geologist/paleontologist and had one go through the conditions at multiple dig sites over a period of years.

And they're not at all as expensive as you'll find many others are.",best backpack for college

70397,"Probably some sort of media/journalism or film degree, or at least a more writing-intensive degree like history or english. It was my dream for a while to do writing/directing for magazines, newspapers, television or film or be a communications director for a company. I also liked the idea of production for any news shows. Obviously directing my own film or writing for a national paper like NYT, WashPo would be ideal, but I‚Äôd be happy doing corporate comms, PR or working more on the production/business side if it paid well enough. I took a lot of video editing, journalism, etc type classes in high school and also interned at a paper. I just really found the work fulfilling, especially when I didn‚Äôt necessarily need to worry about opportunities available. 

I‚Äôm still a freshman so I haven‚Äôt declared yet but I‚Äôm now probably going for stats/business analytics or finance. Not what I wanted to do but I can stomach it, and money :( Unfortunate because between the studying for the more math-y degrees and trying to secure work in that field, I don‚Äôt have the time to pursue any of what I liked before. I know they say ‚Äúpursue something safe, do your creative stuff on the side‚Äù but it‚Äôs sort of a scam considering these days, you have to go full send on the backup career to make even that work.",best major to study in college

You could get an Xbox one and go for backwards compatibility and then you could play both red deads on one console. 

I know that EA is a swear around here, but they have several need for speed games in their subscription, this is available on Xbox and PC, and it would give you a bunch of gems to try out like Mass effect, Titanfall 2. Dragon age. Etc. Xbox game pass  had a bunch of games too and sometimes has a sale for a month for a dollar. I think ps has a subscription too but I've never used it.
