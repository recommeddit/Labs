57190,"pH is a scale that(typically) ranges from 1-14, from 1 to 6.99999... it is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions(H^(+)) (how acidic it is), from 7.000...01 to 14 it measures concentration of hydroxide ions(HO^(-))(how basic it is), and 7 is neutral(neither acidic nor basic, roughly where tap water is).  The scale itself is logarithmic (each increment of 1 is an increase of 10 times, i.e. a 6 is ten times more concentrated than 7, 5 is one hundred times more concentrated than 7, etc), and changes from measuring acidity to basity because when you mix an aqueous acidic solution with an aqueous basic solution the hydrogen ions bond with the hydroxide ions, forming H2O.  However, drinking water that is more than one step away from 7 can be dangerous, both because of how reactive acids and bases are, as well as toxicity from whatever substance is dissolved in it.

TL;DR: Yeah, pH does relate to waters purity.

Whether water is hard or soft refers to concentration of dissolved minerals, like limestone or calcium carbonate.  Water extracted from rivers or lakes *tends* to be softer than water extracted from aquifers, however local conditions can cause significant variation.  Hard water is more of an issue for maintenance of infrastructure and plumbing than a health issue, worst it will realistically do is dry out your hair or skin.

Aquifers are large underground volumes of water, typically found in formations of porous rock that are between layers of impermeable rock, as opposed to being underground lakes (though water can dissolve away enough rock to form them).  Springs are fed by aquifers, as they are often under pressure.  They are replenished chiefly by rainfall and snowmelt that percolates through the ground.  However, due to the fact that they're underground it can be difficult to protect them from pollution, and very difficult to clean up should they become polluted.  Additionally, many aquifers are being drawn at a rate that exceeds their rate of replenishment, meaning that unless aquifer water usage is decreased they'll run dry, which is bad for a multitude of reasons.",best water brand

6158,Apparently the doc makes are huge dicks. They interviewed and videotaped a  wrestler or two who have huge collections of wrestling toys and the wrestlers opted not to let them use the footage. The guy is far to nice to directly call them out but definitely talked about parts during his and  others podcasts. Stuff like being disrespectful/damaging the toys and then asking to cut them out of the movie all together but use footage of their collection with out credit too...,best Netflix documentary
