25011,"The main reason people have a problem with it is it changes the dynamic of Peter Parker in a negative way. In the comics and the newest movies he has his powers, but is also a genuinely brilliant person who is able to develop and formulate the compounds for his webbing on his own. It shows that the powers aren’t the only thing he has going for him, and really hammers home the genius nerd aspect of his regular life. With organic web-shooters you lose that, instead it’s just the spider bite that gives him everything he needs to be Spider-Man and that’s all there is to it. I don’t get bothered by it as much as some, but I do prefer the mechanical web shooters for this reason. This is all also part of why I think Tom Holland’s introduction as Spider-Man was so damn good in Civil War, since over the span of a relatively short conversation with Iron Man they’re able to cover his interest in tech, demonstrate his physical strength, the ingenuity of his webbing, and his motivations for being Spider-Man, all without ever having to actually retread his origin story we’ve seen so many times already or even say the words “with great power comes great responsibility.” It was really well done and sold me on the character.",best spiderman actor

12869,"Hi! Since my husband is a redditor and hasn't actually asked what I want...here's my list. I do a list so whatever actually happens is a bit of a surprise; I'm not the type to actually ask and expect to get all of it...hat seems greedy. Anyway. 

A day (weekend would be even better) without having to change diapers.

Not having to do any of my daily chores (although cooking is one of my favorite hobbies so I still want to do that) BUT still have a clean house None of this ""dont worry about the housework today dear, it'll be there for you tomorrow"" garbage. Lol

Help my daughter make me a card or a homemade present. She's not old enough to do anything herself (19 months) but helpin her make a macaroni necklace and crayon-decorated card for me would absolutely make my year. 

As for purchaseable gifts:

Scrapbooking supplies (specifically stamps and ink pads). Get your woman something that is related to her hobby outside of parenting! (And maybe provide her with some alone time to use it)

Also, a case of my favorite ale or a bottle of my favorite wine is always a good idea. 

Flowers and chocolate are generally acceptable, but I personally prefer gifts that are reusable or contain alcohol. 

Oh, and lots of hugs and kisses.",best gifts for mom
