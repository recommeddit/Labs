Binary search trees because they have a pretty decent runtime and are fun to draw
If it's not on the list I don't recommend it.
"My 6s plus was the one I held onto for the longest, and that phone served me very very well for a long time! The 4s was another phone that I fondly remember."
this link doesn't go anywhere for me. But I would say Iron Man 1.
"Golden Globe (John Varley): [Abbreviated Spoiler](/s ""Hell bent mafia hitmen, a race throughout the solar system, child abuse, megalomania, boardroom power plays, pocket chainsaws, attempted  genocide and the Rude Theatre's take on King Lear..."")."
"How has no one said Gucci bloom! My favorite perfume ever, I highly recommend. Has hints of jasmine and gardenia, very fresh and light."
When?
It also specializes in portamento
"I spent a day with **Adam Sandler** on the set of Mr. Deeds back in 2001 as part of my brother's make a wish. Guy was really down to earth and his entire crew were all very accommodating and sensible. As I get older, I continue to read good things about him from other fans."
Bless your heart.
"I think TPAB is better than any pac album, but ready to die definitely could be better"
Most Wanted holds up pretty damn well too

I would just do San Diego and skip Los Angeles

I’d rearrange the order but the top 10 movies listed are spot on!
"> I have a pair of Wayfarers from the 60s when they were made by Bausch and Lomb, and those things are tanks. The pair I lost weren't even comparable.

You have no idea how bad it's gotten. I broke a pair of 2013 WFs at a party in 2017, bought another pair, and had the screws fall out within weeks due to no mistreatment. They replaced those, then those got stolen. Insurance covered that, tried a Clubmaster series. Liked how they looked but felt cheap. Broke in two weeks. Asked for a refund and was told no. Would've gone elsewhere but couldn't *see*, so I asked the clerk for a recommendation and he gave me some POLOS that have held up nicely (despite also being Luxottica).

Moral of the story, do not buy Luxottica brands anymore, ever. They're basically roadside vendor quality now at high-fashion markups. I have more faith in quality control from *drug dealers*, FFS."
The OneNote Clipping one.
"Yooo, studying linguistics here. I kinda just accepted the offer because it was a safety choice. I didn’t get into business program but ya I fucking miss my finance lessons especially since I took some finance electives last semester. I feel like I’m not benefiting from linguistics at all"
"I’ve had fish, turtles, frogs, geckos, ducks, rabbits, hamsters. Pretty much every category. I’d say a cat is the least work of any of them — but if allergies is a problem that’s obviously not an option. Of any of the pets I’ve ever had cats are the least maintenance. 

Basically, don’t get a pet."
Perfect! Thanks for the tip!
