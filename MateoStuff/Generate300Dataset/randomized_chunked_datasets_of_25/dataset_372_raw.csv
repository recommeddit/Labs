"Oh, right. I knew Stankonia was their highest rated on metacritic, that's why I said it (I just checked it out and their earlier albums aren't even there)."
"Yes but I think the skypad 2.0 is better on every aspect literally lasting a lifetime . I guess you are playing slow paced games like cs and val so the skypad might not be for you and yeah artisan mousepads are gonna last for a few years and the quality is top notch, it’s really worth buying over all the  standard mousepads."
"I don't know how well it works if you don't speak french, but [Médine - Victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyCRCUFECrA) is miles ahead of any other motivation song.

Other than that : [Kenny loggins - Danger Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E)."
"I don't know too much, other than that it is uninvadable."
"Your immune system weakened to get infected, so you have to strengthen it back up. There's not really a 'fast as possible' way to do this especially if you are already down. Common sense like sleeping well, eating well, drinking a lot of fluids, frequent showers,and staying away from tobacco/alcohol/recreational drugs are the best ways I found for myself but it is only a marginal improvement, maybe 6-8hr faster recovery.

There are *really* good OTC drugs however which will stop runny noses, suppress coughs and negate sore throats. Generally when I use these I neglect the sleeping/showering/eating/drinking phases and a cold I would get over in 3-5 days now last 2-3 weeks with milder symptoms as well as a good hit to the chequebook."
Might take 3-4 weeks till I do that but I will keep you on my bookmarks to ask you.
"I don't have any experience with reptiles, but any interest in rodents? I wouldn't recommend hamsters (I had a couple when I was a kid and I remember them biting and not being receptive to pets), but guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats may be worth considering. I had friends with these types of pets when I was a kid and they all seemed pretty happy with them. Guinea pigs and rabbits are also featured in my local SPCA's animal education classroom and are handled by kids frequently, so they could be good options for a gentle toddler's first pet. 

Also, I wouldn't completely rule out a dog if that's your preferred pet. Some dogs are perfectly happy to be apartment couch potatoes with little space. A dog rescue organization with a foster program or one that is able to thoroughly evaluate a dog's history and behavior (e.g., my local SPCA evaluates the dogs at the facility and handpicks a few to interact with the kids during animal education) should be able to help match you with a dog that fits your needs."
"YNAB is great if you need to change the way you think about budgeting and tracking expenses, but I find it too involved/handholding. I prefer Mint because I don’t care as much about the allocation of funds to specific budget categories and stuff like that. I just want more of an overall picture of my accounts and spending"
"I worked the VIP security for Super Bowl 49 doing the male pat downs. Pretty much saw/touched everyone for pregame, halftime, or had any special roles. Almost everybody was pretty cool, the only person that was a clear asshole was Kevin Hart. He had the second biggest group of people with him behind Katty Perry (who was performing halftime) and they were all at least 6 foot, while he was down at 5 foot 4. His whole group was weirded out by the pat down, and Kevin just ran straight past me before I could do anything. He got stopped by the rest of our crew, yelled at them and just kept going. Pretty sad stuff."
"Holy shit my childhood turned into a nightmare...

I love it."

Any idea when this will be updated. I just found out about this and am really trying to get a book I'm looking for
"For me, the best resource for fragrance info and recomendations have been Jeremy Fragrance https://www.youtube.com/user/Jeremyfragrance His top 10 lists are very good."
I really enjoy The Expanse series by James SA Corey. I find it difficult to mention any one of the books in the same breath as Dune but the series as a whole is large in scope and is defintely in my top 5 Sci fi sagas
Get a good 2060S then if you won't be gaming on it much since those would run quieter I'm sure. EVGA is imo the best Nvidia card partner so I would suggest their 2060S offerings.
Because he is a rabi.
"My favorite currently is any time the dog does her ""someone is at the door bark"" the cat growls in response. She HATES visitors and will growl from wherever she is, even if she is in another room.

Its very weird because she is VERY affectionate to me and my dad (who lives with) and my brother (who comes about once a mont) and my exboyfriend (who used to spend a lot of time over). Anyone else and she is out of there so fast. If it is a kid you won't see her for an hour until after they leave. If it is an adult she might make some appearances."
"Instant oatmeal, cinnamon, raisins or apple chunks...just add water.


Plain yogurt with fresh or frozen fruit.
