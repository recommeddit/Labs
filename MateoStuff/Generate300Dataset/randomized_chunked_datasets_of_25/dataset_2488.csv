67894,best science fiction novel,"The actual book by Hadelman comes in many different flavors too. His editor originally made him cut some of the Earth based stuff, so the original novel is shorter and more focused on the space combat scenes than the soldier attempting to reintegrate into society scenes.

> Editions published prior to 1991 were abridged for space by the original editor (omitting the middle section, a novella titled You Can Never Go Back). 

>The 1991 edition restored many expurgated sections, primarily dealing with the changes that befall human civilization over the course of William Mandella's life. 

>[In 1997, Avon published the version that Haldeman called ""definitive"", with ""everything restored"" and ""a less funny cover illustration.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forever_War#Editions)"
73731,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Well that was the point of this post that I made anyway. I think itâ€™s not really fair to generalise the experience of all matte screen protectors having tried only one, but I definitely agree that itâ€™s a very personal thing. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people saying that they love writing on glass because it feels like writing with a fountain pen."
13165,best gifts for mom,"My SO gifted a deep clean by maid service for our home when our daughter was about 6-7 months.  He ((and I!)) liked how much happier and less stressed about my mountain of housework I was, and continued once a month cleanings for almost two years.  When the ladies came,  we had a family date.  

The most appreciated gift he could've ever given me."
45020,best items under $100,a knitted cardigan.
1387,best ice cream flavor,"Pistachio slaps, banana does too

Blue moon is quite lovely.  What flavor is blue?

For topping with fruit I'd say vanilla bean.

Mint chocolate's delicious but only when green

&#x200B;

Chocolate explosion is great in small servings

Though three scoops of that can be rather unnerving

But flavor's not all, for the butterfat mix

Makes creamy consistency licks upon licks"
37943,best Marvel movie,End game has more character development and a defined ending. Infinity war really is part 1 of 2. I think if they said it was part 1 of 2 it would've been better received critically. I think all things considered infinity war is the far better film but if you watch both out of context standalone  then I could see why endgame is more pleasing
62802,Best Data Science textbook,"Thanks! I went with the Oreilly book as it's geared more towards data science. Im not going to be 100&#37; reliant on the book, and know I'll be consulting other resources to help myself along as well."
1229,best ice cream flavor,"Either the classic Cookies'n'Cream, or there's an Ice Cream place that I know is in Florida and Georgia (maybe elsewhere) that makes a Cinnamon flavor that is just amazing."
73144,best Linux distro,Pop OS
13233,best gifts for mom,"I love my kindle. I also love being able to take a bathroom break alone. Maybe you could get her a kindle, and a night of her own. I enjoy a long hot bath with candles and reading to unwind. 

Also, body massages are good. Body massages and chocolate are better. Body massages, chocolate, and booze is even better."
28082,best breakfast foods,"corrib oil breakfast roll, cant bate it"
71696,best movies with a cool twist,IMO The Village has one of the BEST mind blowing moments at the end of the film. Tho it had several mini moments when you just sit their thinking whaaaattt? the ending is genius how it all unfolds and all the little pieces connect in your mind !!
66665,best soccer team in the world,I know I'm french. They were not that bad.
15422,best tree for the garden,"Personally I like the Mexican Sycamore with the silver leaves. The Burr oak is a close second but the sheer size of the Mexican sycamore really pulls me in. The Mexican oak, live oak and red oak are all very nice trees as well."
32205,best hotel to live in,"I'm convinced most people don't know the difference between good and shitty liquor. I did wine sampling at stores and people would enjoy a wine until you told them it was $6. Or the opposite, it was gross until they found out it was $30"
43964,best items under $100,"Generic, but good. And does its job."
13096,best gifts for mom,"My genius girlfriend noticed that my mum has some Wade figurines. She has part of two different sets.  We managed to find the missing two from one set and got another two that puts her other set to 5/8.

She is gonna be pissed at how much we spent so I'm also bringing the gift of lying about how much they cost too."

24221,best anime,How in the world is Clannad: After Story below Clannad?
5938,best programming language for web development,"This is really kind of the right answer. 

I find that with each new language I know, what I'm really learning is just a new syntax.. and it is really the new concepts that are valuable. Those new concepts are often ported over, mentally, into the other languages that I know."
69026,best science fiction novel,I'm glad you mentioned Jack McDevitt because I have really enjoyed his books and they don't seem to get much notice.
57544,best cologne,"Around 4 sprays, each side of the neck, my chest and my wrist and I just dab the other one. This fragrance is actually very loud. It projects and lasts minimum 8 hours on my skin."
