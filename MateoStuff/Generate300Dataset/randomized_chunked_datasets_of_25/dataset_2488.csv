67894,"The actual book by Hadelman comes in many different flavors too. His editor originally made him cut some of the Earth based stuff, so the original novel is shorter and more focused on the space combat scenes than the soldier attempting to reintegrate into society scenes.

> Editions published prior to 1991 were abridged for space by the original editor (omitting the middle section, a novella titled You Can Never Go Back). 

>The 1991 edition restored many expurgated sections, primarily dealing with the changes that befall human civilization over the course of William Mandella's life. 

>[In 1997, Avon published the version that Haldeman called ""definitive"", with ""everything restored"" and ""a less funny cover illustration.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forever_War#Editions)",best science fiction novel

Blue moon is quite lovely.  What flavor is blue?

For topping with fruit I'd say vanilla bean.

Mint chocolate's delicious but only when green

Chocolate explosion is great in small servings

Though three scoops of that can be rather unnerving

But flavor's not all, for the butterfat mix

37943,End game has more character development and a defined ending. Infinity war really is part 1 of 2. I think if they said it was part 1 of 2 it would've been better received critically. I think all things considered infinity war is the far better film but if you watch both out of context standalone  then I could see why endgame is more pleasing,best Marvel movie
