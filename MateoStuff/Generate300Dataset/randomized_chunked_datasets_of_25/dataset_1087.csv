32766,"It’s not far from Puerto Morelos. There is GREAT snorkeling there when the seas are calm. The resort can arrange a half day trip for you. Other than that, we simply enjoyed the resort. And don’t hesitate to order multiple lobster tails. If you like Mezcal, the guys behind the bar can do some sampling for you. And ask for a Sangrita in between. Plus, try Agavero. It’s a tequila. For us, there is literally nothing we would change about that resort.",best vacation resort
