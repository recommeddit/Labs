32766,best vacation resort,"It’s not far from Puerto Morelos. There is GREAT snorkeling there when the seas are calm. The resort can arrange a half day trip for you. Other than that, we simply enjoyed the resort. And don’t hesitate to order multiple lobster tails. If you like Mezcal, the guys behind the bar can do some sampling for you. And ask for a Sangrita in between. Plus, try Agavero. It’s a tequila. For us, there is literally nothing we would change about that resort."
8868,best toothpaste,"Whitening toothpastes do work somewhat, but all they are is an abrasive. So, they take off part of your enamel (very slowly, but it can happen especially after drinking an acid like soda).

There is a difference between high end toothpastes. Some will have Stannous Flouride, which is much more superior to normal flouride and it is more expensive: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin%28II%29_fluoride"

4732,best home improvement store,"The president of Menards is also a real piece of shit, so I avoid shopping there. Luckily, there's **always** a Home Depot or Lowe's directly across the street."
38341,best newspapers to read,"I pay for NYT and WaPo. I'd pay for my local paper, but I work for it. I find myself wanting to access WSJ pretty often but have not yet started paying. I stopped paying for the New Yorker in college."

It's based on Ubuntu so whatever works with Ubuntu and it's parent Debian, it will work on Kubuntu.

33841,best Pokemon game,"Many people consider different games as the best Pokemon game, which usually include HGSS, BW + their sequels, Emerald, Platinum, and others. You could probably pick one that sounds the most interesting, though older games tend to lack quality of life changes that the newer games have introduced (such as not having unlimited use TMs before BW)"

8777,best toothpaste,"Hygienist—water piks are gaining in popularity again and the newer ones are very effective ion removing food around braces, implants, bridges and larger gaps. I generally don’t recommend Listerine as a rinse unless it’s the Zero, meaning it’s alcohol free.  Listerine has the most alcohol of any of the rinses and tt not only kills the bad bacteria, but it also kills the good bacteria that helps neutralize acids and bad breath."

22067,best celebrity,"DeForest Kelly.  We had a twentieth anniversary Star Trek convention in town.  A friend called me and told me to go to the liquor store and buy a bottle of (forgotten brand) bourbon, and take it to room XXX at the hotel.  I thought it was weird, but it was a good friend, so I did it.  

When I went to the room, DeForest Kelly opened the door.  I am a huge trekkist, so I was over the moon.  He handed me a fifty , would not accept the cahnge I owed him, then growled ""You're not going to make a man drink alone, are you?""

That's how I got to spend about a half hour shooting the breeze with Dr. McCoy."

70279,best major to study in college,"Does this include Master's programs, as well?

I've taken two stats courses and one research methods course so far and I've done well in all of them, but I struggled quite hard to get an A in the Stats courses. As of now I'm pretty sure I wanna be a master's-level clinician, which I don't think is as research-heavy as a PhD, but correct me if I'm wrong?"
