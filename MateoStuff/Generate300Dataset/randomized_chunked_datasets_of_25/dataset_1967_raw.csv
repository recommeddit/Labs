"My ferret used to things like that too. She would bring her babies to me, dump them all in my lap and go and hide somewhere and sleep for an hour, which I totally understand now that I'm a mum!  
Or she would take a couple to wherever she wanted them but then get tired so she would bring the next one to me and make me follow her and take her babies wherever she wanted them so she didn't have to keep going back and forth carrying all the babies. She was so loving and trusting, I miss her so much"
"Absolutely they will.  I was put into a practice harness where I was able to see how hard I could pull the control cords and how to untangle possible chute line crosses.  

They would drill me on how to do certain things and I'd have to respond as quickly as I could.

They taught me a bunch of hand signals where they could easily communicate with me if I needed to extend my legs more or less, alter any part of my body during descent.

Also, I had a radio in my ear where they could tell me what to do should I start doing something dumb.  lol"
"Acer XB271HU. 2560x1440 144 Hz IPS panel, OC to 165, comes with G-Sync."
"good point. just this week you'll have sucic and stanisic making their u21s debuts, kids born and developed in Austria and Germany."
Dior Sausage is one of my absolute favorites. There's another one I got in Colombia years ago that I haven't been able to find -- Dendur Zero
"Childhood's End should have made the list, I think."
"First paper that came to mind for me as well.  Not only is the paper critically important, but it can be understood by anyone at all by just following the simple logic.  It restructured the world of physics with what amounts essentially to a thought experiment and clear, elegant method."
"I started with minimal JavaScript experience, and followed this course: https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

By the end of the course I was able to make a react front end application fairly easily.

"I‚Äôve been wanting to try that, especially for those annoyingly painful finger and thumb tip ‚Äòsplits‚Äô I get in the wintertime. Any tips for prep/application? How about toxicity, is it considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù?"
"I'm changing my opinion every couple of years about that question.

I was using FF until end of last year, but it was sucking up so much memory that I stopped.

I'm now using Brave (Chrome based), which also uses quite a bit of memory, but not as much as FF."
"The best ones in the series imo is HeartGold/SoulSilver, OmegaRuby/AlphaSapphire, FireRed/LeafGreen, and Black2/White2.

Which version you play of each gen doesn't matter, the only thing thats different is that some Pokemon can be exclusively caught in a certain version, which is only a problem if you plan to 100% the game."
"Check out Gone Girl, Fractured and Knives Out. All great films with twists and turns in them similar to the ones you‚Äôve mentioned"
"Best post in this thread.  Granted, dentists are probably the WORST people to ask for oral care.  That would be like asking a mechanic to recommend an oil for long engine life.  They're technicians, not researchers.  The fact that everyone here says ""toothpaste doesn't matter"" confirms this in my eyes.  

Xylitol kills bacteria that cause cavities (caries).  There are so many studies that have shown significant decreases in cavities after xylitol administration (gummy bears, gum, etc):

I remember reading one study showing it worked better than fluoride at cavity prevention.  I can't seem to find it right now, but if I do I will post it."
$530 seems like a lot compared to a lot of the other monitors around that level
This was super good! I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at the ridiculousness of some of the perspectives throughout the documentary but all in all it really was amazing
"Love for Philly from a New Yorker, nice!"
"Best?: all kinds...
Worst?: Good n' Plenty.... Because it masquerades like it's real candy, but it's really just poison."
I use node-fetch and I don't have experience with Axios. What is the advantage?
"its up there, certainly wasnt his worst though smh"
These are all great docs! Searching for Sugar Man was amazing just wish it was longer than it was haha. Definitely the shortest documentary I‚Äôve watched.
"I love my iPhone XR but nope. Buy a IPhone 11 for almost the same price. Ultra wide camera is really nice to have, I miss it (had a LG before). But you don‚Äôt get nightshots on XR. The camera is just ok really."
"Guitar is easier than piano in that transposition doesn‚Äôt require you to memorize entirely new fingering patterns. The downside is that finger go ouchie sometimes. 

I think uke is harder than guitar even though finger no go ouchie because the tuning goes down a fifth, up a third, then up a fourth, which makes it waaaay more confusing to learn scales and intervals, whereas guitar is up fourths, up a third, then up another fourth."
"Kim is SO kind. Ran into her a couple times at a restaurant and have family friends that know her and always defend her. She truly is a great person. She is also TINY IRL. Like 5 feet tall and her body doesn‚Äôt look nearly as disproportionate as it does in photos. She was insanely tan as well! Lol  but yeah, Genuinely a great woman with a huge heart. Loves her fans and understands her life is public and has no problem with that. She knows it took fans to get where she is. Kourt on the other hand... lol 

Kourtney has kids that go to my cousin‚Äôs school. As we saw in this last season, she hates the fame and can get really upset about all the attention. She yelled at one of the parents at a bday party at a pumpkin patch because she thought they were taking pics of her. Maybe they were, maybe they weren‚Äôt... point is she‚Äôs super bothered by the attention she gets and can be quite hostile about it. 

Idk if she understands that Poosh wouldnt exists without KUWTK. She needs to humble herself. There is no such thing as privacy anymore. You capitalized on being ‚Äúyourself‚Äù and your lifestyle. If you want to keep that lifestyle, you have to continue to share ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThat just is what it is"
"I have both the 270 and a 920 and for the most part they are both very nice cameras.

I noticed the 270 takes a more zoomed in picture than the 920 does when they are side by side on top of the same monitor

I think the 270 is a great starter cam"
Up vote for Moon. Highly underrated.
