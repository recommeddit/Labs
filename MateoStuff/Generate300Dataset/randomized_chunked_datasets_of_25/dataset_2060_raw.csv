I would definitely replace **Forbidden Island** with**Forbidden Dessert** of you are also planning on getting **Pandemic** as Dessert differentiates itself while Island feels too much like pandemic light. I would also put **Sushi Go Party** as the main recommendation with **7 Wonders** as the alternate. Last I would replace **Splendor** with **Dominion** as I feel it had more staying power and scratched a similar itch for me.

"Oh man, Poland spring is the shit. Used to be skeptical when I first moved to New England. Now I am a believer."
"That's a lovely Christmas surprise. But, holy shit. $70? An hour flight where I live is over $300.00. Booking it months in advance might get you mid $200s."
I don't have that issue. You might need to check your internet connection.
"I've found mint more maintenance and cumbersome myself in the past. That of course may have changed. 

The new ynab android app really makes life easy with all the auto-imports, especially since we have multiple people using the app. All I do is monthly set my budget, then enter my expenses as they occur, and rest happens automatically. Now that I have monthly funding goals for most of my expense categories, budgeting takes 10 minutes tops a month after those were set up.

I still adjust on overspent categories as needed."

">  homeless+no phone= public libraries are now your hangout spot

My local library was literally the #1 thing that helped me stop being homeless years ago."
"Unfortunately no, I moved from Java to C# pretty quickly. I've had some basic HTML earlier but I don't remember anything anymore.."
"Tried this a few weeks ago, was told ""Sorry, don't have an electronic copy"" ... was a bit disappointed :/"
"While I agree with you. I would never spend $10k on a Downhill bike, as my first buy, because I don't know if I'm going to like the sport. So I'll get a cheaper $2k bike, if I like, I buy the 10k in the future.   


I still will get a good $2k bike, not gonna be cheap and get a $800 bike. However I'll not get the high end. 

Of course, it's different when the scale is in the thousands, but it can apply to low end stuff too. the c270 is a $20 cam with really good quality, it's not a $10 webcam, or just a bad cam. So, as you're entering the hobby, it's better not to spend much if you don't have the money."

"I meant dissociate (the difference is largely grammatical) For me as someone with ADHD that percentage of time in the shower is the only time I don't have to herd my thoughts like cats. I have a hard time turning off my brain unless I am in the shower. I let my brain run rampant to process all my anxiety and then I sort of ""wake up"" and am better at being a person after that."
"That is a direct quote from Gilmore Girls. I am also a fan and thought you would get it.

"United haven't exactly dominated the league either, they're only 2(?) ahead of us in terms of league titles. Its nip and tuck between the two teams in every metric, its just that United have seen more recent success that many people view them as the far more successful team, the reality is its neck and neck. We've done more in Europe, United have done more domestically, and of course they have the proper treble on their side."
How is that possible? Scholarship Grants?
Thanks for the catch!
"I have an eighteen month old. I'd like my husband take me to breakfast and then both of them leave the house for many hours. It's been so long since I've been in the house alone. I want to clean it really well, and then nap in my bed ALONE."
That's why I have a lock on my bag when I travel.
