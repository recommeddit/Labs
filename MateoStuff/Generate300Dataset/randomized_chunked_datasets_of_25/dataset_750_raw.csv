"It’s weird to say but I wanted so bad to get hooked, tried really hard multiple times and never could get into it. Awesome music tho!"
Agreed. They have an amazing return policy. I've returned several books and gotten prompt refunds with no questions asked.

"Unfortunately not, would have been great to get rid of more highlights."
"PROTIP: Buy the plastic, bubble wrap thingy and wrap all your bags, it's safer (the time that takes to open them it's simply too long) and your goods will be more protected also ONLY CARRY VALUABLES IN CARRY-ON BAG.

"Thought that was a little weird.  It's Eminem, not MM."
"Yeah sorry when I typed it out it was spaced correctly then when I sent it, it unspaced and got reformatted"

Meant to say Dreamscape (1984) damn autocorrect.
In which universe is a motorcycle license under 100 dollars?
"I remember the house that gave these out when I was trick-or-treating as a kid, and that was a good 15 years ago. If I had the funds, I'd do this myself. But since we get too many kids for that to work, I will give out the Reese's instead. I figure that's still a good haul for the kiddies."
I feel they approach the sci-fi genre in anime better than most. I find the best sci-fi the ones that don't focus on the the action. I find they cover some really interesting topics in the show and movie. Inspired the matrix so that's saying something :P

"If you can't spend a couple of hours to learn about or talk to a counselor about financial aid.. maybe ...  just maybe... the UC system isn't for you. The schools are beholden to different interests that give money to students for different reasons... don't blame the UC system, or the CSU system for that matter, blame the lack of interest most voters have in adequately funding higher education. Voters said no to the last ballot item about increasing funding for the three California systems of higher education."
"Constructive Living by David K. Reynolds. Also, if you want a great jumpstart on getting your ass in gear, I recently discovered Philosopher's Notes website and their video class Optimal Living. Huge, huge fan. For the price of a book, you can watch all 10 episodes."

"I really enjoyed this and you definitely saved tons of time and money for anyone reading your post!

Thanks to you, I'm going Rinke Fusion and splurging on an Apple Leather. I would've spent more than those two combined anyway over the life of my phone but now I have the clear option for stickers and the classy leather (which I would've pined over but dismissed as apple premium charge for mediocre quality)

Thanks again - you seem like a great techy and good human!"
SSLP over MMLP?
"Ft is so far. Far from school, far from the beach. Don't under any circumstances apply for the scholar's floor. I got placed there randomly...boring. But other floors were really fun. I'm pretty sure Manzanita is the best though. That's where I hung out most besides ft, and it was so nice and had the best view. Plus it was right next to the beach, and I know a lot of people who liked Carillo Dining Commons best out of all the places to eat. Make that your first choice I think."
"They hate you for your confidence in saying it because secretly they like it too. REAL vanilla ice cream, as in you can see the specks of ground vanilla bean in it, tastes amazing. The cheap shit they can't legally call ice cream and is the color of glue, not so much."
Yes! I was checking to see if anyone else had mentioned this one. It's soooo good!!
