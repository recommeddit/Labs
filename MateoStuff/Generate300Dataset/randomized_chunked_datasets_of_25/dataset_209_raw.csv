"I payed 3 times to visit one, just because I saw a few bikes in there without any rear wheels. 2, 3, 1 days respectively."
"Debian.

"I've had my Patagonia Paxat for almost a year now and it's still going strong after biking to work everyday over the summer and 2 weeks in Israel carrying my shit while we hiked countless mountains and went to numerous beaches. 

I'm a student in college so I also use it for school and it's awesome! This is also one of the bigger backpacks you can buy so there's room for all your shit. It's also water resistant which is an incredibly nice feature. I had a jansport and whenever it poured some of my notebooks would get wet."
