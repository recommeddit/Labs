24580,"These 10 come to my mind, but honestly, my preferences change depending on the mood I’m on at a given moment. 

1- Neon Genesis Evangelion. What can I say? I love how the “chosen Hero” trope arc gets in the way of Shinji’s development, and how the anime challenges us to go through his process of self-discovery and acceptance. 

2- Princess Mononoke. I actually like this one more than Spirited Away, the impact it’s dark imagery an beautiful designs left on my child memories is still very present, and on re-watch I apperciate how it cared about creating complex characters with particular needs instead of using the lazy “hoomans bad, animals gud” routine.

3- Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu/Legend of the Galactic Heroes. After an eternity in my PTW list, I picked up this and damn, I was not prepared. This show is massive, and not only because of it’s lenght: it has a plethora of well-written characters with their own story arcs and interactions, great battles with war tactics, political intrigues, and far more fun I expected.

4- Ghost in the Shell. I really specially liked the quiet moments where the story came to us visually, instead of by dialogue.

5- Monster. Many say that the story could have been told in less episodes, but for me every single second of this show adds up, it was never about chasing Johan but about wandering the environment that created him and knowing the people that populates it.

6- Paprika. It manages to deliver the feel of belivable craziness only found in dreams.

7- Madoka Magica. I have my masochist side, I guess. I’m not very familiar with the magical girl genre so I struggled to identify some elements at first, but realizing how the tropes about power of firendship and such were affected by Urobuchi’s filter was a hell of a ride. 

8- Jin-Roh. Watched this movie with zero prior knowledge aside from the cover, I actually came expecting ultra-violent schlock. Well, I stand corrected.

9- Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan. This show feels like a constant climax, only it just keeps getting even more intense every second. Form the writing, to the animation, to the score and acting, every little element overflows energy at every moment.

10- JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. On a critic mindset I probably would not give this spot to JoJo’s, specially given how many phenomenal animes I have not mentioned, but honestly this show resonates with me personally more than any other does. It’s the perfect balance between over the top insanity and legitimally compelling characters and stories, the constant changes and unrestrained creativity keeps it fresh and full of possibilities, and I just love combat based on mind battles and tricks.",best anime
45253,"I have a nice PC for gaming, I have an XB1 as my main console, and I have a PS4 that I got on sale for a few exclusives.

I completely agree with your thought of wanting to use a console because you're on a PC all day. I rarely play games on my PC. There's something nice about sitting down at a console and just having it ""feel different"".",best gaming system
22646,"Also, not on thread, but the writer of the Redwall series, Brian Jacques, was in Atlanta doing a promo on his book one day, so some friends and I skipped school and drove there to meet him. One of my friends, Chuck, had introduced us to the books and we had read them all. Chuck had all of his books, even the non-redwall book, and was the reason we were going.

When we got there, the bookstore had a policy that Mr. Jacques would only sign his name on books, no personalized messages, and would only sign books that had been bought there. My friend Chuck was devastated.

I bought my books and waited in line to get them signed, and when I got there I told Mr. Jacques about Chuck and he signed a leaflet to him with a personalized address.

After the event was over, Mr. Jacques walked right by us and saw me, and asked me which friend was Chuck. I pointed and he stopped, got out his pen, personally addressed every book to Chuck that he had brought with him, (This was about 9 books or so) even writing ""Brian Jacques"" in the ""This book comes from the library of"" sticker in the non-RedWall book he had brought.

Totally awesome guy and the world is worse off without him. He was the Steve Irwin of teen-fiction until he passed. God be with you, sir.",best celebrity

I would’ve been maybe 15 or 16, and my brother was dating this girl who was somewhat of a celebrity in Australia, so naturally everything she had and wore was expensive. Anyway, the first time I met her she was wearing it but I was far too embarrassed and dorky to ask her. So when they went out, I snuck into my brothers room and found it. That Christmas my family bought it for me as a gift and now it becomes a repeat when I start to run out, it’s my number one staple!!",best perfume
