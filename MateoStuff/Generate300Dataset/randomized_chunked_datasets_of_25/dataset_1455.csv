17498,best iOS game,"I seemed to hit a ceiling where I couldn't progress fast at all. I don't remember the trophy count, somewhere between 8k-10k trophies I think. I had 4-5 or more brawlers over 500 trophies etc.

I kept getting stupid team mates that would stand around or leave etc. It was a frustrating time. I could do solo brawls and get trophies but I had to play meta champs if I wanted to play to win."

17802,best Kardashian,"I mean, Khloe has gone through shit yet she seems somewhat empathetic. 

People don‚Äôt see Kylie as traumatised. They see her as someone who is very out of touch (e.g mink slippers) and never seems happy and extremely co-dependent. If she hates the fame she could easily move away and stay low-key (see: Blake Lively, Eva Mendez for example), but she likes the $$$ and she‚Äôs never had a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life so it‚Äôs not that simple for her."

56830,best desktop monitor,"Hi,

What would be the best monitor to purchase that meet all the requirements : 

* G-sync
* 240HZ 
* IPS Panel
* RBG 
* 1440P
* 0.1-1MS response time

I've been having issues finding one. I was checking out the [Predator XB3](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/predator-model/UM.HX3AA.X05) but found out it's only ""G-SYNC Compatible"" which ended up making me cancel the order after finding out the difference in an actual G-sync module chip compared to g-sync compatible. 

Thanks!"
