14519,"I love Ilona Andrews' books and have re-read all their series multiple times. I read almost all romance sub-genres and non-romantic fiction/sci-fi/fantasy too but I especially love world-building storytelling and the way Ilona Andrews has done that in each of their series (and also included romantic relationships) is \*chef's kiss\* good. I would recommend their books to any reader but I think those who read mostly contemporary or historical romances aren't interested in a urban fantasy series. They are missing out!

I have been going through a book slump for the last few weeks and with their newest release in their Hidden Legacy series, ""Emerald Blaze"", I started re-reading the 1st in that series to catch myself up. Book slump officially gone.",best romantic novel
