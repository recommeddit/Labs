"I work for an environmental laboratory and test drinking water in particular.

Brita takes out the chlorine (which they use to sanitize the water) and lead (which shouldnt be there in the first place).  It might also remove some organic compounds that influence taste.  But if you got say 1000mg/L solids in your water and run it through a brita, you are gonna get back water with like 998mg/L solids.  ""Solids"" being whatever dissolved material whether it be salt or cyanide is in the water."
"Actually so far it works OK with Zoom -- it seems like they have put special effort into making that work fairly well. My general worry with Airplay stems from it not working with anything that doesn't specifically support it, like Google meets."

Firefox is laggy. I don’t find the same speed that I have on both Safari and Chrome.
I’m so disappointed because I would love to make the switch to Firefox :(

PS: currently on MacOS, waiting for Ryzen price drop to build my PC :)"
"That makes sense.  And I agree for the most part except that I think it was the manga that changed. 

Also, you could say the same thing (albeit to a lesser extent)  about Harry Potter"
I stopped a year ago and was playing daily since launch. They changed a lot to get more money
Yep :). Could have even been that a team that had beaten SA before started losing a lot of games. That would mean that a bad team has beaten SA. It looks at everything together.
I traveled to California earlier this year and explicitly chose Knott's over Magic Mountain.
