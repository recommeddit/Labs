I meant the 3 Seaworld parks not other Seaworld owned parks like BGW and BGT.
I think I see the University of New Orleans and the University of Copenhagen on there. Undergrad and grad :)
"Let me add... I miss adventure movies with more practical effects than CGI. I don't mind good CGI, but I prefer they shoot on location, build more sets, and do more stunts. Especially for the adventure genre."
The Final Fantasy House is a wild ride for sure.
My favourite.
James Acaster. His four specials are incredible. Outstanding eye for humour and entertainment.
Chunky Monkey!

"The Dara Dhevi in Chiang Mai, Thailand. You can stay in a stand-alone two story villa set amidst 60 acres of rice patties with a private plunge pool. The property is so big they pick you up in a golf cart when you want to go to the main resort."

I doubt the people involved would share your adjectives. I'd say it was highly interesting and probably the most extreme example of total war in world history with the highest degree of human suffering ever.

"That is the cutest story ever. I am laughing in embarrassment for you but I also think it’s the raddest thing you could have said to him. Well done, for real."

"If you're in USA just go to Macy's or Dillard's during a sale and open a credit card for additional savings. I went to Dillard's New year's day and got a nice pair of raybans and Oakley's for 50$ each, and a whole bed set for 30. New year's day next year see you at any  Dillard's next year."
That's how I feel about rails.
