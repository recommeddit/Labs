I have one with blue mx switches. The clicks are like music to my ears. Not so much to people around me though.
"I agree with you on the quality of the product. I just don't like the product in the first place. I vastly prefer the articles that highlight a player's place in history for what he brought to the table and how that affected his team and, in the case of the top ranked players, the sport as a whole.

And you're right about the historical aspect of this type of content. As a fan of NFL history, I'm glad that fans are getting this opportunity to read about people like Jim Brown, Walter Payton, Johnny Unitas, etc. I just hope that readers, especially younger ones, keep their focus on learning about the players instead of caring who they rank ahead of or behind."
"Avril Lavigne. Gave me a hug, because I told her it was my birthday."
Completely agree. I've had this since highschool and this thing can solve systems of equations and even double/triple integrals. It's a fucking godsend.
"Over the years I’ve always made a huge deal about the perfect case for me and eventually came to the conclusion that the speck presidio was the ticket. Bought more than I care to count. FYI for any fellow lovers of this series the new version for 13 is not what it once was. They have essentially removed the best part of the case GRIP. The rubber lines across the back have been replaced with empty channels. They seem to have compensated for this with the whole case being in a semi rubberized finish which is an absolute fingerprint magnet and not even very grippy. Quite disappointed to be honest. I went with applecare and an oem apple leather case this time around. If I’m going to drop my phone at least it will look good as it falls and breaks. It’s a real shame, hopefully speck release’s a traditional candy shell or presidio at some point."

"Anytime I see one of these celebrity being a dick threads I have to come in and say that Mike Rowe is the coolest dude on the planet.

I hung out with him and his cameraman and drank beer with him for like an hour with my buddy while traveling for work."
agreed
"For me. Energy drinks are more disposable ashtrays in my car than anything else. So I don't mind getting the cheapo $1.99 Ed hardy ones or whatever is there. 

For actual flavor. I like the blue full throttle, sugar free rock star, sugar free redbull, and all of the amp ones (green, blue, purple, red, yellow)

I guess the answer to your question is Amp. 


**EDIT:** actually. Now that I think about it, whenever I can find the vitamin water energy drinks, I'll get those. Red and yellow are my favorite


I really need to stop drinking these things now that I think about it. When I have work early in the morning, my breakfast is usually an energy drink and a bunch of ciggarettes."
"Haha nice catch.
it is clean now, that's grime from when I cleaned and sanded the top molding of the cabinets, that's part of what had fell down. Its all clean now."
