34225,best NFL player,"This list also have the reigning MVP listed as the 3rd QB and 10th overall, so I wouldn't put too much stock into it lol."
15178,best tree for the garden,"I've got some landscaping software with 3D models of trees.  

I imported your picture here and I tried a few and thought [this one might look the best](https://imgur.com/a/AxgIUIC)."
66226,best soccer team in the world,They should be third behind AC Milan in all honesty. Recency bias is very flattering.
31324,best country to live in,"There are other factors that are important like: climate, cost of living, ease of integrating into the culture, shopping/conveniences"
11225,best backpack for college,"Yeah, women love adolescents wearing backpacks."
71584,best movies with a cool twist,"I have to say Unbreakable, an underrated M. Night Shyamalan movie. What makes the plot twist so great is that once you see it, you realize that the entire movie was just hinting at it all along. It was already a good movie to begin with, but suddenly everything seems so obvious and just makes sense."

51075,best rap album,"Wait, Metallica's Black Album is at #309, and Master of Puppets is at #462?

I know everybody is saying it, but this list is pretty bad.  NME has lowered itself in my opinion, especially after their review of Arctic Monkeys' ""AM.""  There is just so much they are missing even in the top 100 for anyone to take this seriously."
66223,best soccer team in the world,Think about the primary demographic of this sub (the voting base). Barca has had their best years during this wave of football fans' lifetimes. It makes a lot of sense when you think about who was voting on this.
33826,best Pokemon game,"Mmh there is a new chapter after the league. The sky tower is no more a challenge, and there is no Battle Frontier. But is not a bad game, still a remake and if you want to try something new..."
68890,best science fiction novel,"Where did the Puppies actually say they nominated those authors?

I'm looking at the Hugo nomination stats for that period (2013-2016, http://www.thehugoawards.org/content/pdf/20$NUMHugoStatistics.pdf) and I'm seeing very little evidence that those authors were the ones the Sad/Rabid types were spamming the nominations process with."

62927,Best Data Science textbook,"Good to hear that as I've written Data Science Job myself, basically because of the same reasons you mention: I haven't seen anything on trends or more abstract level than the code. I'm planning to write another book just about those things which are not discussed at all."

41031,best instrument to play,"My first instrument was the ukulele. I’ve been playing it for over 2 years now and I find it really easy. Beginning is the hardest part but hearing of your experience with cello, I think you could pick it up quickly.

After you get the finger positions down for chords and learn how to strum properly you’ll start learning real quick. It’s a really underrated instrument in my opinion. 

The only concern I would bring up about it is the size. Watch some reviews and see what would best fit your hands. I personally like the tenor better than the soprano because it’s easier to hold and the size allows the sound to resonate more. The soprano can congest your fingers on the fretboard.

I also think guitar is easy but I have limited experience with it. (My family owns one but I’m a bass player.) I know some chords and can improvise decently enough but that’s due to my experience with uke. They’re very similar instruments. 

You can even go in between and get a baritone ukulele which has the same tuning as the highest 4 strings of the guitar (D G B E lowest to highest) and is larger than the tenor. 

And finally, about the ukulele tuning. It’s standard tuning is G C E A with the C as the lowest note. If you don’t like the limited range these notes provide or the high to low to high tuning it offers, then you can easily find a set of strings with a low G so the notes rise lowest to highest consistently, like other instruments. I personally like the low G tuning best as it adds more options for finger picking and provides some bass and fullness in the chords. It’s also fun to see people’s reaction when showing them something non traditional."
