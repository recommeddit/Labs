41031,"My first instrument was the ukulele. I’ve been playing it for over 2 years now and I find it really easy. Beginning is the hardest part but hearing of your experience with cello, I think you could pick it up quickly.

After you get the finger positions down for chords and learn how to strum properly you’ll start learning real quick. It’s a really underrated instrument in my opinion. 

The only concern I would bring up about it is the size. Watch some reviews and see what would best fit your hands. I personally like the tenor better than the soprano because it’s easier to hold and the size allows the sound to resonate more. The soprano can congest your fingers on the fretboard.

I also think guitar is easy but I have limited experience with it. (My family owns one but I’m a bass player.) I know some chords and can improvise decently enough but that’s due to my experience with uke. They’re very similar instruments. 

You can even go in between and get a baritone ukulele which has the same tuning as the highest 4 strings of the guitar (D G B E lowest to highest) and is larger than the tenor. 

And finally, about the ukulele tuning. It’s standard tuning is G C E A with the C as the lowest note. If you don’t like the limited range these notes provide or the high to low to high tuning it offers, then you can easily find a set of strings with a low G so the notes rise lowest to highest consistently, like other instruments. I personally like the low G tuning best as it adds more options for finger picking and provides some bass and fullness in the chords. It’s also fun to see people’s reaction when showing them something non traditional.",best instrument to play
