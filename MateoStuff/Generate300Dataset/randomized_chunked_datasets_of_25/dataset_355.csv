22991,best celebrity,Unfortunately they couldn't. But he's still a good guy.
29559,best game console,Fuck yeah. Anyone that doesn't think Red Dead Redemption is worth buying or borrowing a console for is a goddamn commie.
63498,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Can anyone tell me how to use the repo listed for Relocate Reborn? I'm trying to get it to work but I'm not sure what to do with the link provided
71074,best movies with a cool twist,It was too erotic for that level of marketing push. I would say it is one of the best films of the decade and i would be happy if more people watched it.
67361,axios alternatives reddit,">Why all the fuss?

If people here push beginner devs into using Axios all the time and nobody is here to tell me why that isn't a great idea then instead of improving I'll develop bad habits and the echo chamber won't correct that.

Most of us are here to become better developers and, imo, using Axios is not generally setting yourself up for long-term sustainable success."
72946,best Linux distro,"They'll really hate the official documentation then:

> Kali is a Linux distribution specifically geared towards professional penetration testers and security specialists, and given its unique nature, it is NOT a recommended distribution if youâ€™re unfamiliar with Linux or are looking for a general-purpose Linux desktop

212,best terminal file manager reddit,"nnn hands down. It's minimal but I really wouldn't call it basic, it's actually quite advanced, especially with its plugins."
71310,best movies with a cool twist,Surprised no one said Angel Heart.  The last couple minutes bounces the movie into a different genre.
30873,best country to live in,"> Money talks, and Singapore is a good listener.

I feel like this would make an excellent slogan for a Singaporean tourist agency"
60287,best freezer brand,"I've been calling around and got lucky enough to find some local stores that can order me a freezer, I'll just have to wait a few weeks to a month for it to arrive, but that's fine. The stores said they were only doing in store pickup, but when I explained my situation they were very willing to help me and arrange for it to be purchased through them, delivered, and set up for me once it's available. So I'll be able to get it, which is great. I'll just have to wait a bit, but I'm okay with that. 

As for manual defrost VS automatic defrost, do you know of any upright manual defrost ones that are very reliable? My Frigidaire chest freezer that suddenly stopped working was a manual defrost. But apparently that model has caused the same issues for other people so maybe it's just a problem in that one model. I'm not picky about manual VS automatic defrost, as long as whatever upright freezer I get keeps working properly for a long time. But I have noticed that it seems like most of the uprights sold near me are automatic defrost, so my options on defrost method may be limited due to availability. But if I can find a manual defrost one that is very good, I'd definitely consider it. Do you know which brands or models for upright freezers are the best in terms of reliability?"
62066,Best RPG game on PS4,"Cowboy Simulator 2. No, wait. Red Dead Redemption 2. Sorry"
9865,best portable charger,"This product has done me justice more times then I can count, also, built in charging cables for the forgetful(me): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A6L85CC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_jn7XCb3T71K3H"
6364,best Netflix documentary,"Depends on what you think is ""powerful""."
4936,best home improvement store,I'm partial to home depot for most things.  Lowes seemed to have a better selection of lighting.  Flooring came from a flooring liquidation store.
32202,best hotel to live in,I want more stories of the ultra rich
55076,best places to hike in the east coast,"We don't ignore it, it's called The U.P. It's also up north, but it's not Up North. It's The U.P."
64302,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"When I hear of an audiobook I'm interested in, first I:

1. check my library to see if they have it, both physical and in their OverDrive digital catalog
2. if they don't, I (generally with futility) ask that they order it
3. failing that, request a review copy from the publisher
4. failing that, depending on the publisher they may sell the download directly (Tantor, Iambik, Crossroad Press, some others do)
5. failing that, check Downpour
6. failing that, check Audible
7. failing that, check used CD set listings and indeed do the ship, rip, load dance"
21639,best winnie the pooh comic,Pooh just looks so delighted in throwing piglet.
55736,best action and adventure novel series,"The Green Rider series by Kristen Britain.

69479,best major to study in college,"I doubt there will be an upward trend- applicants have gone down, but graduates haven't really decreased, plus there was already a huge glut of unemployed/undermployed lawyers. At best it'll stabilize."
12336,best gifts for mom,Bullets and a new purse holster
56488,best desktop monitor,"I'd say there is no holy grail of monitors because a lot of monitors will check all the boxes, but then there is something that is missing.

I found the msi optix mag274qrf to be quite good, but it's a bit oversaturated and doesn't have srgb. Srgb isn't needed for me, but some want it.

Probably the lg 83 and 850 are the best of the best, but also don't have the best response times /input lag and only go to 144hz. Some may want 165hz or 240hz.

Monitors are all preference and you need to decide what you want in a monitor."
65213,best phone service company,Yes they run it at least 6-8 times per year...usually for a week but sometimes it runs a couple weeks.  It was just ran like 3 weeks ago so it'll likely be a month or so.
70495,best major to study in college,This is what my internship is in right now! (English major) It's a huge learning curve but it's so cool to see how campaigns are developed at every stage.
