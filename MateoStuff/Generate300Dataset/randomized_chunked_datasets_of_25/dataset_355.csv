If people here push beginner devs into using Axios all the time and nobody is here to tell me why that isn't a great idea then instead of improving I'll develop bad habits and the echo chamber won't correct that.

Most of us are here to become better developers and, imo, using Axios is not generally setting yourself up for long-term sustainable success.",axios alternatives reddit

60287,"I've been calling around and got lucky enough to find some local stores that can order me a freezer, I'll just have to wait a few weeks to a month for it to arrive, but that's fine. The stores said they were only doing in store pickup, but when I explained my situation they were very willing to help me and arrange for it to be purchased through them, delivered, and set up for me once it's available. So I'll be able to get it, which is great. I'll just have to wait a bit, but I'm okay with that. 

As for manual defrost VS automatic defrost, do you know of any upright manual defrost ones that are very reliable? My Frigidaire chest freezer that suddenly stopped working was a manual defrost. But apparently that model has caused the same issues for other people so maybe it's just a problem in that one model. I'm not picky about manual VS automatic defrost, as long as whatever upright freezer I get keeps working properly for a long time. But I have noticed that it seems like most of the uprights sold near me are automatic defrost, so my options on defrost method may be limited due to availability. But if I can find a manual defrost one that is very good, I'd definitely consider it. Do you know which brands or models for upright freezers are the best in terms of reliability?",best freezer brand

1. check my library to see if they have it, both physical and in their OverDrive digital catalog
2. if they don't, I (generally with futility) ask that they order it
3. failing that, request a review copy from the publisher
4. failing that, depending on the publisher they may sell the download directly (Tantor, Iambik, Crossroad Press, some others do)
5. failing that, check Downpour

I found the msi optix mag274qrf to be quite good, but it's a bit oversaturated and doesn't have srgb. Srgb isn't needed for me, but some want it.

Probably the lg 83 and 850 are the best of the best, but also don't have the best response times /input lag and only go to 144hz. Some may want 165hz or 240hz.
