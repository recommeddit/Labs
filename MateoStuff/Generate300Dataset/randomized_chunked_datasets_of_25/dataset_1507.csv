62746,Best Data Science textbook,"Of course I'm not counting those cases; I wouldn't expect Jane Street Capital to publish its methods open-source. What I'm saying is that Nate Silver has no training in that sort of rigor expected of graduate students and active researchers in statistics the types of which compose many financial trading firms or other. I've read that page before and that's not really what I'm talking about in terms of publishing methods. I'm speaking more like a white paper or a journal article: I want to see cross-validation, at least bootstrapping to estimate standard error, I want p-values and such. I want something verifiable because his qualitative descriptions are not that. I see you have an MS so I mean you've probably had to dig through a journal article or followed someone else's methods to reproduce results.

Sure what he has is better than nothing but according to my definition of a statistician, he doesn't fulfill that. If he had previously published peer-reviewed work and was active in the stats community then I would be more inclined. I'll call him a ""data pundit"" sure and I mean he himself also refuses to be called a ""statistician""."
30124,best Mexican war to study,"We did a big unit on the Mexican American war, and the Texas revolution. Other major units were the American revolution, the civil war, and the two world wars. We however never learned about the French Indian war. I know it happened and that it was called the 7 years war even tho it wasn’t seven years long, that’s about it."
7292,best iPhone,"I've had my XR for just over a year now after getting it back in May of last year, and I see no reason to upgrade to an 11 (because it's only adding on the 2nd camera and especially not now with the the 12 coming soon)."
61295,Best RPG game on PS4,"Depends on what falls under your understanding of an RPG. Some consider Monster Hunter an RPG, Nier: Automata is a jrpg. Those are two fantastic gamds. If that's not what you meant then I'd say Bloodborne."

2990,best webcamera,"There hasn't been a good new RTS release since StarCraft 2 in 2010. And even that wasn't as good as the original as some of the Korean pros have gone back to StarCraft, the original."
26379,best politician,"Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power. In this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the Mc-mansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years. Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference.

30876,best country to live in,"As an Englishman, I'd say that rain isn't the issue. 

It's the amount of days spent in complete grey skies with a pseudo-cold temperature. It's not a rainstorm. It's soul-suckingly dreary. Rain would at least make it ""weather"" of some kind"

So grateful for this guide"

52016,best iphone case,I’ve gone back and forth between leather and silicone. I prefer the silicone because it seems to work better with the magnets. And I just like the feel more.
66831,best soccer team in the world,"Transfermarkt's valuations are a assessment of market value, not intrinsic value or whatever."
43139,best detective show,"How far did you get? I really struggled to get through the first season. I gave up a couple times. Finally I powered through, and it sunk its teeth in. It’s just about the opposite of a “moments” show. It’s all in the subtle things that you just start to notice after a while. By the end it all ties together. It’s really beautiful...and infuriating realizing that apparently it’s still the same shit over a decade later."
