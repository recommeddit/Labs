"Another vote for The Thin Blue Line, or any Errol Morris, really. I really enjoyed Wormwood, his Netflix series on MKUktra. 

And Minding the Gap is one of my favorite movies of the past couple of years."
I love the bizarre borders videos.
... please feel free to do some research and get back to us. <3
"It honestly kind of is. It really does force you to face your spending head-on, and by the end your whole attitude towards money will change."
Good Eggs Benedict is hard to find... and so worth it. God I love that stuff.

"Once met Colin Hanks at SXSW! My wife noticed him first, but didnâ€™t think it was actually him. We were arguing about it and he came over.  He was super nice, even suggested a band that we should go see. Saw him at said show and he waved at us."
"This conversation is never gonna end, but for what it's worth, Andrew is the best actor here."
Hey I'm a little late to the party but I recommend checking out the ones from [Nimble](https://www.gonimble.com/collections/portable-battery-chargers). It's more expensive than Anker but they use recycled or organic products like corn for their casing !
"I've never used Fantastical, I wasn't a fan of its design. $12 for an app I use all the time I think it's worth it. I subscribe to stuff I like. Like Bear, 1Password, and Timepage. Key features? Nothing insanely notable. I really like the design. I do really like the weather notifications. Honestly. Nothing special now that I think about it. I decided to try it a few months back and I've enjoyed it so far."
"Can't blame them if course materials and institutes suggest to install (offensive security's) Kali Linux .

There less knowledge about getting basics of linux first, but it's all marketing here. People/friends I know who work at SOC positions can't even trouble shoot basics ( I mean really basic stuff) when it comes to linux."
"Someone who goes into the technical details of policy. So not ""we're going to bring jobs back"", but ""we're going to strategically invest in X while funding retraining program Y, which our best analysis says should increase employment among the chronically unemployed by Z%"""
Playing drums (with a full kit) *well* is way harder than playing bass competently (enough for a rock band) IMO.
"I'm guessing it wasn't included originally (looks like it's there) since it's the yearly plan that's promotionally priced (it's really just an ""on sale"" version of the $50/$40 autopay 8GB plan).  The ""25GB"" (8GB+17GB bonus) Walmart plan isn't listed either, but is also the 8GB plan with some modifications.

The $25 one listed without data is a separate plan."

On a more serious note, I have stopped reading papers and get my news from reddit instead. One gets the article as well as the polemics and fact-checking in one place."

"I'll add that telestrations is very enjoyable, but especially if you have a little kid or two in the mix. Somewhere around 4-6 years old. Where they kind of understand what they're looking at or reading, but can't really write or draw. You know, a young drunk person."
Bucuti is awesome.  Eagle Beach is so much better than the high rise area.
Yeah you totally suck!
Ha! That's pretty funny
What graphics card do you have?
