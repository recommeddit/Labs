"I have my doubts about silicone in the sense that it clings in the pockets, and it catches all the fluff, right? I don't know if you know what I mean. It's the material that's like that from memory, I don't know if it does it for the Apple one."
Me too. That seems more like a hardware issue than a browser issue.
Yeah I originally was going to stick to the Udemy prompt but then I saw a bunch of other outside suggestions
"* Sock Em' Boppers.

* Hungry Hungry Hippos.

* A Slip And Slide."

"Film. Worst: almost everything you do is a group project atmosphere. Best: learning about filmmakers, the filmmaking process, and the theory behind why each aspect of a film is important and its effects on the audience and the final product."
That shit tastes oily somehow. To me anyway.
plus one for ali bomaye. any other recommendations for that epic-sounding vocal samples? the only other example i can think of is palmolive by freddie gibbs
"I agree. Maybe I’m just not seeing the hassles others are but I avoided going to chimera and sileo as long as I could thinking it would be crap. I was mistaken. So far I have nothing but positives to say except for the fact that I can’t get credit for my Cydia purchases. I’ve no crashes or stability issues. Then again I do have a lot of supposedly functional tweaks that give me the preference loader error (zeppelin,alkaline, most status bar tweaks, etc) but other than that I’m golden."
"YSL - La Nuit de L'homme. Honestly, you really won't regret buying this. I've never had so many compliments on a cologne before."

"I didn’t know they discontinued it! Bummer, it’s my go to fresh smell"
"I like the crusades because there was so much culture exchange. This was more notable in that it brought a lot of Islamic art and culture to england, also knowledge and goods, etc etc"
"**Spoilers ahead**

""The Visit"" by M. Night Shyamalan looked like your typical ""grandma is possessed by a demon."" But at the end it's revealed that the grandparents aren't possessed, they're just insane asylum escapees, that killed the actual grandparents."
"I'm absolutely enjoying it. My first broadcast class I went into I knew I picked the right major. It's just the amount of work outside of home and at school after classes that I find annoying, but for the most part I don't mind at all. It's just one big grind."
What kind of colognes go well with oily skin?
"Garfield could have been the perfect one. He is the definitive casting for Peter Parker, he got the looks, the attitude, everything right. But he was stuck in a bad movie.

Tom is great, and he has the advantage over Andrew of actually having a good script to work with.

Loved Toby as a child, i think he was good for the time, but the lack of quips and his overall dummy attitude (which is not supposed to last 3 movies after he gains the powers, he should be confident by Spider-Man 2), makes me think he is the worst Peter Parker ever put in screen. Not that he was bad, he was great for the movie he was in, but as a adaptation of the Spidey i know from the comics? Didn't came close. (Even though his stories were pretty much comic accurate.)"

"reverse osmosis is a close second to distillation, and potentially a lot cheaper."
I have been happy with AT&T but recently we have been getting close to the data cap. I think my wife has been using her phone off wifi more or something.
This explains a lot

"Black panther isn't bad or anything, it's just not as great as people say it is...
People only think so highly of it because it made a political statement."
"Cedar Point. The haunted houses are decent, but the haunted walk through areas are where it’s at. Lots of actors interacting with park goers and the atmosphere is interesting."
"Stunning scenery, very nice people, and outstanding food."
