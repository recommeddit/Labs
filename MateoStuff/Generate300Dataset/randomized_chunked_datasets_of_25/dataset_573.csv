53593,best medicine for a cold,"Soooo important. Acetaminophen for those of us in the states (Tylenol) is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. 

A lot of ""combo"" cold drugs have acetaminophen in them, including basically anything that NyQuil makes. I think it's a good idea to stay away from the combo drugs. If you need a decongestant and a expectorant, take one decongestant and one expectorant, not a combo that has a decongestant, an expectorant, an antihistamine, and acetaminophen."

39700,best podcast for biologists,"Just started watching this. It's amazing, thank you."
17823,best Kardashian,"Buce ranked above Scott? I am SHOCKED.

Bruce/Caitlyn is just the biggest piece of shit in my opinion, and really threw his family under the bus. Out of all the shit Kardashians have been through, they have never really gone against somebody in the family, they always had each others backs at the end of the day, Caitlyn literally tried to make money off of any drama and any potentially bad press for them that she could. If I was Kendall or Kylie idk how I could actually trust her.

I for sure think that Rob was dealing with substance abuse when he lived in Khloe and Lamar's house and that didn't help him at all with his mental health. at least now out of the spot light he seems to be doing ok. The lsat few snippets of him we've seen in snapchats he looks to have lost some weight.

Scott, I love him. He really has substance abuse issues, and also is using that to deal with his grief over the loss of his parents, but he seems to be on the up and up now. I really want him and Kourt back together, he seems to be a great dad and when things were good between him and Kourtney, they were really good. Kourtney just always keeps a guard up which leads to her having a stick up her ass 99% of the time unlike when they first got together.

And Kanye, well I am a Kanye Stan till I die, so he gets a spot too. I feel like even when people lash out at him fro saying something, it is truly just because he doesn't know how to properly articulate what is going on in his mind. As somebody who deals with ADHD and a swell of other mental health issues, I sometimes have the same problem, I can't fully articulate it to somebody the way it is making sense in my head...probably also why I leaned towards a creative career myself. I communicate better through my designs than anything else. Kanye will probably always be my number one right up there with Kris lol."
26351,best politician,Old Lyndon 'Big Guy' Johnson.
65207,best phone service company,Nice job Stetson as usual.  But you left out the best plan as far as I can see...the $300 yearly 8GB prioritized AT&T Prepaid plan.  Maybe I just missed it or maybe you only included monthly plans?
16967,best iOS game,"Shout outs to everything by Michael Brough: Imbroglio, Cinco Paus (tho you need a guide if you don’t know Portuguese), P1 Select. Imbroglio is my favorite."
14428,best romantic novel,Enjoyed Transcendence.  It has been the most unusual romance novel I have read this last summer.

66435,best soccer team in the world,It is in the history of the norway
52730,best hiphop album,"There’s a ton of hip-hop albums I’d say are as (or more) artistically ambitious as TPAB and MBDTF. Aquemini, Deltron 3030, Blowout Comb, Undun, Black Up, So It Goes, Veteran, most Flying Lotus albums, most Death Grips albums, most El-P albums, most MF DOOM albums, etc."
33924,best Pokemon game,"Wel for starters if your opponent has a psychic type in gen 1 how do you counter it? It's supposed to be weak to ghost types but due to a bug ghost types are ineffective against it. And anyway every ghost type in gen 1 has poision as a secondary and is thus vulnerable, similarly for bug, (with the exception of caterpie and metapod...) not that there are any strong bug moves.

Further making psychic overpowered is that there is only one special stat making psychic strong at attacking with and resisting such attacks.

Away from the op psychic type critical hits were based off of the speed stat meaning that any high crit chance moves on any moderately fast pokemon crit 99.6% of the time. It would be 100% but for another bug in the game, this same bug causes guranteed hit moves to miss on rare occasions.

That's what i can remember off the top of my head, but the op psychic type along with combined special were the main problems."
39775,best Chrome extensions,"[PanicButton](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panicbutton/faminaibgiklngmfpfbhmokfmnglamcm?hl=en)

makes it easier for you to hide all of your tabs at once just by clicking on a button. They are then saved as bookmarks in a separate folder. Afterwards, the PanicButton turns green and shows you how many tabs are currently hidden.

I use it for.. Reasons.."
41463,best instrument to play,"Well that's closer but still not true. I play in an acoustic folk band and we play in coffeehouses, bars, and outdoor events all the time. It would be an enormous headache to try and bring a keyboard with us everywhere and often just impossible because power sometimes isn't available. And a real piano is straight up out of the question for 9 out of 10 gigs we play.

Piano is absolutely the most versatile, theoretically important instrument I can think of, but it's also among the most impractical to travel with or expect to be able to play at any gig unless you're a big time performer."
69008,best science fiction novel,"A Fire Upon the Deep, Dune, Footfall"
