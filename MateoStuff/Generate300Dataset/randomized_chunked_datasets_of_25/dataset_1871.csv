40415,"Hello, fellow Canadian. I've been doing a similar build for a new system (my motherboard recently died and it's time for some upgrades). 

Also from Canada. I bought this: https://www.amazon.ca/MSI-Radeon-RX-5600-XT/dp/B08CKDLN91/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=ox_sc_act_image_2&smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB

5600xt with the 14gbs memory. I understand that there could be some driver issues but for the price it seems like a deal. For context, the 1660 super is going for $300 to $350 and the 2060 seems to start at $400. $350 for the 5600xt which is supposed to have 2060 like performance, seems like a deal to me.",best midrange GPU

It's like a Stoli soda but adds a little more flavor without a ton of sugar and extra cals.  If you're heavily drinking (as I am wont to do), drink tons and tons of water.  I feel fine in the morning for my workout.",best alcoholic drink

Unlike gas powered motors, electric motors have their torque peak at 0 RPM.  Versus an embarrassingly long lost of vehicles for least for immediately off the line the Spark EV is king.  It quickly falls off to more normal acceleration past that so while it's no Model 3 Performance it also completely destroys a gas Spark for damn sure.",best electric car
