40415,best midrange GPU,"Hello, fellow Canadian. I've been doing a similar build for a new system (my motherboard recently died and it's time for some upgrades). 

Also from Canada. I bought this: https://www.amazon.ca/MSI-Radeon-RX-5600-XT/dp/B08CKDLN91/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&psc=1&ref_=ox_sc_act_image_2&smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB

5600xt with the 14gbs memory. I understand that there could be some driver issues but for the price it seems like a deal. For context, the 1660 super is going for $300 to $350 and the 2060 seems to start at $400. $350 for the 5600xt which is supposed to have 2060 like performance, seems like a deal to me."
10989,best backpack for college,"Nice, I think you made a good choice. I got Flat Dark Earth or whatever it's called. I sort of regret not getting black, it's kind of hard to pull off this color with more muted outfits haha"
28297,best breakfast foods,We just discovered eggs and guacamole with hot tomato sauce on toast. That's my new quick breakfast winner.
29163,best web hosting service,Just seen this thread. Gave siteground a look....but they seem to be down just now.
69506,best major to study in college,"I was thinking it was some commentary on eventually being able to afford the best toilet paper.

I was wrong."
31960,best hotel to live in,"Good point... I haven't had status with Marriott but I used to deliver training at a Marriott conference center. Marriott handled the catering, a/v, and on-site student housing.  Employees were nearly always on the ball, and of the Marriott properties I have stayed at, none of them have been dirty or have had poor service."

28856,best breakfast foods,"Oatmeal is great! So are smoothies. 

Hot oatmeal tip: add a spoonful of peanut butter to your oatmeal. It adds extra protein and elevates the taste and texture ðŸ¤—"

57492,best water brand,"Well, TDS is total disolved solids ... like the mineral-ieness of your mineral water, for a while there I was into the differences in that. Like Fiji, for example, happens to be higher in silica so it has a real smooth feeling. But i did a quick Google search since it's been a while, and Evian actually has a higher TDS level than Fiji, though bot sure of the mineral breakdown"
34384,best NFL player,I actually think it was called the Stickum Coast Offense.
36053,best alcoholic drink,"I do Stoli soda with a splash (just a splash!) of cranberry.  A shot of stoli is only 96 cals, soda is 0, and a tiny splash is probably 10 cals or less.  It's like a Stoli soda but adds a little more flavor without a ton of sugar and extra cals.  If you're heavily drinking (as I am wont to do), drink tons and tons of water.  I feel fine in the morning for my workout."
33312,best electric car,"They're fairly rare, but there aren't fire reports on them or the Volts like there are with the Bolts.  The Spark EV is famous for having an absurd amount of torque right off the line.

https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/a25632693/chevy-spark-ev-used-car-deal/

Unlike gas powered motors, electric motors have their torque peak at 0 RPM.  Versus an embarrassingly long lost of vehicles for least for immediately off the line the Spark EV is king.  It quickly falls off to more normal acceleration past that so while it's no Model 3 Performance it also completely destroys a gas Spark for damn sure."
31177,best country to live in,"Yes, we have a big need for that here in Hawaii."

61961,Best RPG game on PS4,I would argue that AC Odyssey is a pure (and very decent) rpg in the vein of Witcher 3.
6433,best Netflix documentary,"The Keepers on Netflix is really good. I'm currently watching the Vow on HBO, it's about a recent cult. The Bundy Tapes is awesome as well"
4181,best text editor,"Maybe, but Iâ€™ll be done a years projects before you get emacs configured to do anything."
