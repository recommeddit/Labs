If you're looking for more of a hardcore RPG, Divinity: Original I and II are fantastic games with great stories, just do some research and make sure it's the kind of game you'd enjoy. Dragon Age: Inquisition is pretty good and seems up your alley.",Best RPG game on PS4

A product suggestion though, I purchased a belkin 10,000 mah charger that is about the same size as my phone. It seems well built, and reviews for it were all very good, and it is a trusted brand. It was definitely significantly less than $50 CAD (on sale, near 50 full price), but I do not remember the exact price. 

They might also have a bank that charges using a lightning cord, or type C,  instead of standard microUSB.
