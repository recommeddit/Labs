22465,best celebrity,"My manager at gamestop back in 2005 told me about the time he was a kid and ran into Jake the Snake Roberts at some diner or something while on a family trip.

Jake was sitting at a booth eating by himself. My boss was a big fan of wrestling and wanted to go over and say hello. My boss asked Jake ""where's Damien?"" and the wrestler responded, ""Right here, kid."" as he adjusted his junk. 

Seemed pretty on-brand."

52997,best hiphop album,"Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy

I was a fan of Ye since College Dripout but interest in him waned when 808 came out because I was in my ""real hip-hop"" phase. This album along with the the G.O.O.D Fridays tracks turned me into a stan. It's a masterpiece. The beats were epic and this was Kanye lyrically at his best. Easily my favorite album of all time.

Common - BE

Common's poetic lyricism, Kanye's soul sampling, John Legend lending his talents and a live performance on the Chappelle's show. What's not to love.

Ludacris - Chicken & Beer

Luda is an underrated lyricist and ""Hip Hop Quotables"" is a good example of that. Also , it's just a hood ass album. I know my mom got tired of me blasting Blow It Out. 

Danny Brown - XXX

I like it because we get the glorification of drug culture from someone who's also a victim of it and Pac Blood gives me chills whenever I hear that chorus. I love it because it gave us a pussy eating anthem and I never looked at Cool Ranch doritoes the same way ever again.

Jay Z - 444

This is a more mature Sean exercising his lyrical muscles while spitting out nuggets of wisdom. My favorite song off this changes every time I listen to it. We can talk about the social commentary and his personal life, but really, it's just great raps over dope beats."

33020,best energy drink,"Unless there is something you specifically object to, all you really need are drinks with 0g of sugar, which is most of what's on the market. Every brand I can think of has at least some 0g flavors, and many of the best tasting lines are exclusively sugar-free. Generally I'd recommend giving the following lines a chance: 3D, Adrenaline Shoc, Alani Nu, Beyond Raw, C4, and Xyience. If you need something value-oriented, the sugar free releases from Summit (an Aldi brand) are $1 each and surprisingly good. If you want maximum energy sans sugar, you want Total War RTD, which you can generally find at the Vitamin Shoppe, but it is pricey and targeted towards gym bros."

36802,best alcoholic drink,"My favorite drink is a Bronx Cocktail, (gin, equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, and a splash of orange juice) but that's really only good for old people who want to drink something that tastes vaguely like cough syrup so you don't drink too fast.

My favorite thing to make when I was 21 is this beverage I invented called the Mango Berry Shit Spritzer.  That's where you take whatever random fruit-punch/crystal light/whatever mix you can find, combine it in a punch bowl with 7-up, a carton of rainbow sorbet, and the cheapest vodka you can find, and serve it to your friends so they don't make their way into your closet where you keep the good booze."

That being said I'm going to switch back to Apple in september. But that's for personal reasons as I came to more and more dislike Google so closely attached to a device I carry with me 24/7. So I'm willing to pay more for the device and less with my data later on..."
