51082,best rap album,NME has been pretty bad for the past couple of years. They used to be the magazine I disagreed the least with.
62214,Best RPG game on PS4,"they may have RPG elements but they are not RPGs. the definition has not broadened. we could call ANYTHING an RPG becausr you always play a character, but that's not the definition for these games"
17719,best iOS game,"Risk: global domination

It’s risk, but way better than the physical board game because you don’t spend all that time rolling dice"
60253,best freezer brand,"I use an upright that I keep in the garage.  A chest freezer can be pretty hard on your back if you're dealing with several pounds of frozen goods at shin level.

I suggest looking for a ""scratch and dent"" model.  You can normally get a new freezer with a little bit of shipping damage and save 10-20%."

56563,best desktop monitor,"It's a cinema term for any resolution that's about 2000 pixels wide. In practice that almost always means 1080p.

edit: 2k textures would probably mean 2048x2048 resolution (of the texture, not the monitor)."
62232,Best RPG game on PS4,"Horizon Zero Dawn is an amazing game! Just the graphics made people really excited when it came out! Also the story gets you caught  up in a lot of things and buying and selling can be hard at first also inventory management is not that bad (at least for me)

Minecraft is one no not one the BEST game of all time it brings creative mode where you can fly and build whatever you want! And then theres survival mode (the best one) it begins with you punching a tree to going to another dimension and then fighting the final boss The Ender Dragon (easier than you expect) so get this if you want a fun and creative experience! 

Bot are great games both are open world and both are AMAZING! :)"

27096,best board games,"Yup. A lot of weight in their favor by their close circle. 

Yet Elaine and Efka, two separate people (likely that would have their own unique top 10) has a weight equal to just ONE of them, because that's the video(s) they put out.

Definitely an imperfect system, but you can only do what you can with the data you're given. Sure, you could homogenize the list that come from the same outlet/channel, but Ambie has dramatically different tastes than Roy Cannaday or Tom Vasal, so you'd end up homogenizing too far with that method too. /shrug"

63652,best books for time management reddit,"Take ""Essentialism by Greg McKeown"" off the list, and put ""Less by Leo Babuta"" in its place.

&#x200B;

Essentialism is an ad for McKeown's Consulting business, and publishing the implementation details of his formula was not going to increase his client base. So he filled the book with with vague and confusing advice, padding each chapter with pointless sentences to lend the impression of substance through chapter size.

&#x200B;

Here is some of his bullshit:

&#x200B;

Simplify your life. Only read these essential books: the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, and the Book of Mormon. Totally great advice there. ::eyeroll::

&#x200B;

What is the definition of simplicity? Three chapters  and [this diagram](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/245446248426113695/?nic_v2=1a6eiZy7a). Well. That is IT. That diagram was the key that unlocked my KUNDALINI (Bhagavad Gita), procured my ticket to THE CELESTIAL KINGDOM (Book of Mormon), reserved MY SEAT AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER (Bible), and made me FOREMOST AMONGST ALLAH'S CHOSEN (Koran). 

&#x200B;

Yep, all in all, a most pretentious and useless book."

15060,best romantic novel,"My favorite romances: Julia Quinn's Bridgerton and Smythe Smith books

Lynn Kurland's De Piaget time travel romance series

I'm also enjoying North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell which isn't a romance per se but its like a refined version of Pride and Prejudice."
