All your silly straws or an awesome watermelon???? You drive a hard bargain sir.

To me there is no text editor war. What every works for you, that's the one you should be using."
"Home Depot near me is typically cheaper than Lowe's on like products.  I used to go to Lowe's all the time but they got rid of their rental truck and they have no tool rentals in case I need something specific.  Home Depot has tool rental and truck rental.

I called the Lowe's GM about the truck.  He stated it wasn't profitable and I explained to him that it was a value added service.  They shouldn't be looking to profit on it, but at most break even.  The idea that they have the truck would encourage me to purchase from them.  I then said to him that if I wanted to get a large order I would have to pay their exorbitant $80 delivery fee.  He responded snarky and said ""It's $79"".  Definitely no reason to shop at Lowe's now."
y would u put kim and kris on the same poll lol?? couldve left out rob
I had an awesome doc who would write me prescriptions for the good stuff after it was pulled off the shelves in Oregon.

"I really appreciate stories like this, as the issues with cheap USB-C cables and wall-warts should be the prime example as to why Apple not providing cables/wallwarts is a bad idea. The most common response to people making the point that ""if apple doesn't include the charger people will by cheapo ones"" is just ""lol no they won't. who'd buy a cheap charger for their 1000 dollar device""

Stories like this prove that, not only would people cheap out, smart people will cheap out, even the ones whom should really know better. People like saving money, even if they already spent a grand on something as it is."

"ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET: Drink hot water or tea every hour, on the hour, until your pee is clear. Repeat until sickness disappears. Seriously. 

And yes, I'm Chinese.

EDIT: I'm not sure exactly why this works, but I'm sure it has something to do with flushing your system of the virus, and also water thins mucus so it's easier to clear."

I've heard that rumor! What a spectacle.
I have never in my life once thought that a padlocked zipper was to prevent theft - I always assumed it was to prevent the zipper from being accidentally pulled open during the transit process. What kind of fucking idiot thinks that that little lock would prevent a determined thief from getting into your luggage?
808 is best doee
"When looking at reviews, check recent ones. A 3 year old review is almost useless. Some of these places have an incredibly high turnover in staff. You lose a good head chef, your food turns to shit.  And vice-versa, if they fire the head of housekeeping and hire a hard nosed clean freak, you'll suddenly see the cleanliness jump.  

I've seen this a lot in Mexico. Places that I would swear by up and down 1 year, take a sudden dive 2 years later, and no one wants to go there anymore."
"I'm looking for a calendar app that I can share with my wife.

I travel a lot for work, so i'd like to be able to update a shared calendar with my away days.

Any ideas?"
"I streamed for over a year doing arts & crafts and gaming exclusively from the native app on my PS4 and using the Streamlabs app on my phone. A YEAR. Now thanks to my hard work and the generosity of my viewers I have a great mid-range PC and I can do way more. But I'm glad I worked my way up to it rather than shelling out up front. If you are considering streaming, do what you can with what you've got. If it's the right path for you, you'll find the motivation and resources  to get better equipment, etc. Besides, it excites your long-time followers to help you achieve those goals! Streaming is pretty much all about those goals... :)"

"There's a lot of open space to this room, I honestly think white would make it look that much larger.  Are you wanting something different in color? How would you like to style this room I guess would be the first question."
Yeah they are but it's a hell of a lot less plastic than an entire regular toothbrush or the disposable heads on an electric one
