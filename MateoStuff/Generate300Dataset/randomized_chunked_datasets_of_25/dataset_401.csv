30809,best country to live in,"Ah, yes... Life on easy mode. Denmark is a nice play to live but pretty dull. We are not all racists but there is no doubt that people from the Middle East will have a harder time than others. 

Also, drink a beer to meet new people - we are not that out going if not going out, know what I mean ? ;)"

28854,best breakfast foods,"Do you work in an office, school, or somewhere with a microwave? *Make breakfast at work.* My very first job was in the office of a hunger relief organization and everyone there had a desk drawer that was a mini-pantry, complete with spoons, cups, bowls, etc. They taught me the magic of making breakfast at work to avoid getting up early or having to eat in the car. I’ve had two other jobs since then and my coworkers definitely thought it was weird at first but they all came around to building their own mini pantries. My current obsession is oatmeal (which many others have mentioned), so my pantry is full of nut butters, nuts (hazelnuts and pecans are my fave), apples, bananas, honey, dried fruits, maple syrup, cinnamon, chocolate chips (it only takes a few!), bacon bits, dried herbs, and SALT. ALWAYS ADD SALT TO YOUR OATMEAL NO MATTER WHAT THIS IS RULE #1. The oatmeal is super cheap and customizable so you’ll have something different every day. It takes exactly 3 minutes to cook in the microwave with water (or milk if you’re fancy like that). And if some of your ingredients are about to go bad before you can use them just share with your coworkers and hope they’ll eventually return the favor. Dang now I kinda wish I was at work so I could have some oatmeal....."

16831,best pet for toddlers,"I’m going to be real. No matter how much a child swears up and down the pet will be 100% their responsibility it never ends up being that way. The responsibility always ends up being unloaded on the rest of the family once the novelty wears off. 

So, unless YOU want a pet, do not buy one. It’s okay to say no. She will live. 

If you eventually decide to just not get a pet, though, please just tell her that. Just a hard no. It’s kind of sad that she’s selling baked good to the neighbors over something that won’t ever happen."

63087,Best online React course,"Maximilian's course is great but for a complete beginner, I would still recommend Stephen's course for a complete beginner because the file system he organized made me leave the course although I know that it is the right way but that's not beginner-friendly. I decided to do it again after Stephen's"

47501,best state to visit in the United States,Couple of days with a friend on Nantucket. His family was from there so they had an old falling down beach house. Would have been horribly expensive if not for that
5829,best programming language for web development,"The reason for not noting HTML or CSS is because they said they have basic-intermediate knowledge of it. Of course they could improve on that but I'd do so by using something else and improve on it while learning something new. Create some simple page and eventually add some data from a database through PHP. That way by creating webpages and going more complex you'll eventually also learn more on HTML and CSS. 

&nbsp;

I do however disagree on not encouraging anyone to learn JavaScript. It enables the developer to make the front end more interesting. It's a really powerful language. Though as they ask for back end languages I can understand you may not recommend it but there are even back end uses for JavaScript, see Node.js for example. I haven't used it myself but it seems really good for web apps at least. It all depends on what they want to make."
