56367,"I’m currently having the Aw2721D, and it’s fucking amazing. Absolutely brilliant color and very minimal, if not not at all IPS glow, plus high refresh rate and low pixel response time. It’s not better than the G7, per se, but I find that the alienware got better quality control. I used 3 G7 before moving on to the alienware. My first G7 got this weird pink tint on the monitor when turning on HDR, so got an exchange for that. The next one had a really weird flickering black bar on the left side of the monitor, so that got returned as well. The next one got busted monitor stand, as I cannot adjust its height, it’s always at the lowest position and cannot raise it. I returned that and got the alienware. It was amazing from the start no problem whatsoever. Also, the AW2721D’s contrast ratio is very desirable, especially for IPS panels, imo",best desktop monitor
