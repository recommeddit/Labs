Firefly. A board game with multiple story options to play including Solo play. One game takes an hour or so. People who don't know the TV show (if those people exist) can still enjoy this game even if they don't understand how cool it is to acquire Jane and Janes hat.

Twilight Imperium. A game of intergalactic diplomacy and war. You'll be reading the rules for a while. If you want others to play with you allow them time to read the rules or send them a link to the rules online so they can read at their leisure before coming.  One game takes one day. Start by 10am latest.

Super Dungeon Explorer. You need bare minimum 3 people playing; 2 people to be the hero adventurers and one person to be the bad guy dungeon master handling all the monsters. A great game to start people on before introducing them to Dungeons and Dragons.  

There are card games such as Dragonwood, Splendor, Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens, Kittens in a blender, Gloom and Fluxx. I also recommend keeping Uno around, it has lasted the ages.",best board games
