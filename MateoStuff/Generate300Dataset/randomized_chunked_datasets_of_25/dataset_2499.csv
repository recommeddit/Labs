3987,best online college,"Have you tried taking a course at one of these institutions? I would suggest you do so before casting its students aside-- you could be passing up the opportunity to hire some very innovative and well-put-together people.  It takes a tremendous amount of self-discipline to go through a 2 or 3 year program online with little to no social support, work a full-time job on top of that, and for a lot of students they are also parenting at the same time.

Don't knock it til you've tried it."

3772,best college for research,"Aussie here. I work with lots of Indians and get along with them a lot, they often joke and say I'm a white-born Indian and various other things, all in fun.

Anyway, I was talking with one about university degrees and he was going on about how he went to one of the best universities in the world and India has the best universities in the world.

I've found some Indians (not all) even though they have moved to a foreign country with a foreign language because **they know** they're far better off here than back home will still talk about their homeland like it's the best place in the universe.

Anyway, I challenged him on it and said the university I went to is definitely in the top 1000 in the world, and I asked if his was and he said ""Yes it will be top 10!""

In 2018 mine is at #80 and his is still not mentioned."

61687,Best RPG game on PS4,"Final Fantasy X/X-2 remaster.  It is originally a PS2 game so idk if you have played previous Playstation consoles but it is one of the best in the series and is very traditional compared to RPGs today. FFX is traditional turn based. X-2 tried to evolve the series with an evolution of turn based with a time gauge and faster inputs. It also introduced the job system so your character can change classes during battle which change their attack set.

Final Fantasy XII remaster is also good. It expanded on the job system.

FFXV is the evolution of the mechanics introduced in FFX-2 except you mainly control the protagonist and you can input side character commands as battles happen in real time. There is sort of a pause feature when accessing item menu so you can take time to figure some tactics if you need to pause.


There also is a pretty interesting F2P game that just released last month called Genshin Impact. This isn't a game that you can always play in long sessions however as there is energy like a mobile game and later in the game it takes time to complete things. That being said you can still easily put in 50 hours before you start feeling the effects of the time gate.

Edit: also forgot World of Final Fantasy. It's like Pokemon with final fantasy characters. You can get the vase game + maxima dlc for around $20."
