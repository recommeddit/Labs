65870,best college in california,"What schools are even in the University of Virginia system? 

edit: I found a list. http://www.schev.edu/students/publications/public4year.pdf

It seems like Virginia has a different organization of tertiary education than California. California has the UC system for research universities, state universities for the education of the bulk of the workforce, and community colleges. Virginia's system might be more accessible solely because it is set up to be. The UC system isn't, and is made for the top 12.5% of CA graduates."

66119,best college in california,"If you do create a reddit for your college, please let me know."
57993,best cologne,Try it first.  Some smells just don’t work on some people inexplicably
21552,best winnie the pooh comic,Feces.
10428,best suitcase lock,"As a frequently traveler all over the world:

A) Don't check anything you don't want to be stolen.  They'll just take the whole fucking bag.  Just assume your shit will be stolen if you check it in a third world country.  

B) Try to pack a maximum sized carry on and have a backpack or shoulder bag.  You can easily pack for a week (5-7 days) in a carry on. Just roll your clothes.  Hell, I can pack 3 suits, 1 pair of shoes, and enough shirts, underwear, socks, etc for a week long trip.

C) Baggage handlers give less than two shits about your bag, so expect your bag to be damaged and or broken if you check it.

D) Pack as light as possible and buy shit at your destination if needed.  Sure, bring basic toiletries, but fuck it if it is more than 3oz and doesn't fit in your sandwich bag.  In your sandwich bag have toothpaste, shaving cream, hair gel or spray, and a small bottle of cologne if you'd like.  Just pack your SOLID deodorant, shavers, and toothbrush in your carry on.

E) Don't fuck with the TSA people.  They don't make the rules and make minimum wage...just do your shit and get through.  If it is so much of a fucking issue, pay your $80 and get Global Access and TSA Precheck.

F)  Don't bring shit you don't want to lose.  Unless you are sure your hotel has a safe, it could be stolen.  I've had shit stolen in 5 star hotels, so just assume it's going to grow legs, unless it is in a safe or on your body.

G) ALWAYS CARRY YOUR PASSPORT OR PUT IT IN A SAFE."
59568,best perfume,"So far I've tested Room Service, Morning Chess, and Poets of Berlin and loved all of them. Still have Smoke Show, Dear Polly, and Mango Skin left to try with what I've got."

32142,best hotel to live in,How did you like China? Did you visit any other part of it?
20620,best workout music,I came to say The Prodigy as well.  Invaders Must Die and Omen are my favorites.
61233,Best RPG game on PS4,"More variety to weapons? Where do I sign?!

I'm definitely going to give it a try :)"
3839,best online college,"As someone who used to work for two For Profit online education companies, I would encourage you to go with the distance learning branch of a traditional Non-Profit university.  The For Profits are just out for a buck and often you leave ill-equipped for an actual career.  This is especially true in fields that require licensure, such as teaching or Psychology.  Also, if the hiring manager has had a bad experience with someone from that online school, exactly because they are ill-equipped, they're going to judge everyone else from that school with the same lens. This can be true of Brick and Mortar institutions as well, but usually then there are enough people from that particular school in an area to even out the reputation a bit.  But I'd definitely recommend staying away from For Profit education if at all possible."
52798,best hiphop album,"I see what you mean. I guess it's just labels at the end of the day. I've heard Post Malone be called rap, but he clearly isn't. I mean it's not like there weren't plenty of rappers glorifying all the same shit. There's still concious rap and contentless rap just like there always was.

If I were to choose one of the newer kids and say ok I can kinda see what's going on here and kinda like some of it is Ski Mask the Slump God. At first I was like what the fuck is this trash and eventually I was repping him to people. Creative, fun loving, and really wacky off the wall.

The new movement is more akin to the mentality of party punk rock I find rather than political or social statements. But there's also still plenty of great stuff happening in between. JID is the example that really jumps to mind. I also really like some of cupcaKke's stuff."

53672,best medicine for a cold,"I almost always make it with just loratadine and ambroxol (don't know if that's the correct English name), if I'm not coughing not even ambroxol. Paracetamol for fever and I call it a day. Unless I see yellowish mucus, then I go to the doctor."
70801,best movies with a cool twist,The Salton Sea has a pretty good twist.  Plus Vincent Dinofrio putting people’s dongs in a badger cage
62009,Best RPG game on PS4,I was the same. I think it took me something like 4 attempts to actually stick to it. The first three tries I made it to the end of white orchard but just wasn't interested. The 4th though was incredibly boring during white orchard but I pushed through it and once I got to the barons quest line I was hooked and couldn't put it down. I've completed the game 3 times now and two of those with all the dlc content. The blood and wine dlc is a must and is simply amazing.
