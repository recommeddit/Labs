25652,">Adam Gilchrist at number 6, Warne at 7 and Lee at 8 must have been the most disheartening tail any ever bowled to. Once you'd finally seen off Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Waugh and Martyn you had those three to deal with. One their day they were worth 300. How can it not be the best side of all time with that going for it?

You underestimate them. Gilchrist, Warne and Lee usually came in at 7, 8 and 9. The top six was Hayden, Langer, Ponting, M Waugh, S Waugh and Martyn for the early part, then Martyn moved to number four and guys like Love, Lehmann, Symonds, Katich, Clarke, and Hussey juggled the number 5 and 6 spots. The batting strength was insane. Australia essentially had seven batsmen in their Test team at the time, while every other team had five or six.",best cricket teams of all time

9299,"pretty surprised a lot of comments are mentioning that whitening toothpaste or those with stannous fluoride are bad. from what I’ve read stannous fluoride targets gingivitis and other fluorides don’t. whitening ingredients are at low concentrations and shouldn’t negatively affect your dental health, if used as stated by mfg. many toothpastes that aren’t advertised as whitening may also contain the same abrasives in whitening toothpaste that could potentially harm enamel as well. this is just what I’ve gathered but it’s still a real concern- just wanted to put my opinion out there!

imo best habit is to floss regularly, brush (with a fluoride toothpaste) after you floss, don’t rinse away the toothpaste, and don’t use mouthwash after you brush your teeth. floss regularly after meals. don’t forget to scrape your tongue. 

speaking on vanity’s sake since this is /r/beauty I do think whitening toothpaste and whitening strips make the biggest difference if you cannot afford a whitening session with dentist. Colgate has a 3% peroxide toothpaste that has made an extreme difference in my teeth appearance, my gum health is fine. perhaps use in moderation/reduce use once your teeth are at the desired color if there’s concerns 

there is also another toothpaste i looked into, haven’t bought yet because I have a lot. it’s called sensodyne with novamin, it’s only available in Canada iirc but you can order on Amazon. novamin is an ingredient that can repair enamel and reduce teeth sensitivity.",best toothpaste

28795,"This is how I cook my eggs if I need some on a day I'm not already using my Instantpot. If I've already got the IP out to cook a meal in, I'll do 6 eggs in it while gathering and prepping my ingredients but I won't pull it out just for eggs. Rest of the time, I place 5 eggs in my electric kettle, cover with tap water and set to boil. It has an auto shut off once it hits boil so I can just walk away and come back sometime in the next hour and pour off the water before stashing eggs in the fridge. Easiest thing ever and I usually add a good splash of vinegar into the water at the same time to help descale the kettle since I have very hard water.  This method of cooking eggs is seriously underated. Most people don't even know about it and are amazed that eggs boil so perfectly using it without needing a timer or anything.",best breakfast foods
