7249,best iPhone,"Hey, even though I am not an iphone user, but trust me, never buy a mobile phone, which is older than 1 year.
The reason I am saying this is because mobile technology changes within 6 months and bi a to your mobile will surely affect in battery life since even though you are buying it today it might have been manufactured way before.
Now a days in advance of iPhone 12, iPhone 11 is a good choice to buy.
I recommend you my pal to pitch in some more money and buy the iPhone 11.
You will not regret, neither will your mind wander to another phone choice..."

I definitely didn’t want a big ugly case. I never even drop my phone. Just want to be safe if it ever happens. I’m a cautious person lol"

12328,best gifts for mom,Haha. I got that same sort of look. But then she noticed the insert in the box our jeweler added. It's a nice write up about what the birthstone means and something about becoming a mother.

I think that the Vapor/Alphafly, Pegasus, and Zoom Fly are all great shoes, I also run in Hokas, New Balance, and some Brooks(I have a running shoe problem) and the Pegasus is the best all arounder that I have worn. Not amazing in any on area, but not bad at any specific."
