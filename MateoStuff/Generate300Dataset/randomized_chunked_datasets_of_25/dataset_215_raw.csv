"Maybe unconventional, but I get a lot of utility from Easy Bills Reminder (Android) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aa3.easybillsreminder

It's 100% manually input based, but that's what I like about it. I just look a week ahead and pay the bills as they're due. 

No more emails alerts or trying to remember due dates. I also don't use auto pay for about half of my bills so this is incredibly useful to be reminded of the bills none the less.

It's pretty basic but it may meet your needs with manual input and keeping track of a balance and or individual transactions."

I have an aqua control+ and I’m looking to get a new pad here soon. I really enjoy the feel but would like a touch more speed. I like the stopping power of the ac+.
yup. i 100% agree with this. i traveled for work to many countries and all over the US. the worst thing that should happen is that you need to get new clothes. anything more valuable should be shipped and insured.
"In the morning the red curtains make it this deep red, in my mind just like and uterus must have been, and it's great for sleeping! Cozy and comfy"

"See FALD is the least important factor to me. Color depth and black levels, sure, but motion clarity/refresh rate is by far first. I think different people look at different things, like OLED is great to me for the above reasons, the brightness or even contrast ration itself, outside absolute blacks much less so. And the pixel response is far more impressive to me (I hate ghosting and crap) i think with the pixel response too the 120hz seems closer to 144hz on an IPS or VA. But to each their own.

And that's the clincher, other than something doing everything other than ultra-high refresh like the CX its probably just preferance + budget."

"On Spotify you can find a good amount of science-related podcasts. 

   I haven’t been listening to them as often but Skeptics Guide to the Universe (bunch of skeptics and a neurosurgeon discuss current events in science) and Bedside Rounds (physician talking about history of medicine in an easy to understand way) are  both pretty interesting. 

Also any of the Joe Rogan Experience podcasts with Dr. Rhonda Patrick are great, you get a TON of information."

**R for Data Science** by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund

[https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/)

First learn how to manipulate data. This  book will give you a thorough grinding in wrangling, manipulating, transforming and visualizing data. The entire book is based around code and expects you to work through the book with him. This book is the most practical book I've read on Data Science. 

**Introduction to Statistical Learning with R by** by Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani, Gareth James, and Daniela Witten

[https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/) 

also watch the videos!  [https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) 

This book is probably recommended more than any other book on /r/datascience, and for good reason. The material is accessible enough after a little bit of calculus, shows you some of the theoretical aspects and really gives you a good idea of what different algorithms do and when to apply them. It has a practical end of chapter section devoted to applying the principles used. 

**Applied Predictive Modeling** by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson 

[https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485/](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485/)

This is the pragmatic sister text to introduction to statistical learning. It is a lot less math driven, and provides many useful heuristics and tidbits of information directly applicable to your data science projects. 

**Deep Learning with R** by Francois Chollett and J.J. Allaire 

[https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X/](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X/) 

A great introduction to deep learning techniques. Included are chapters on the theory behind how these models work, and longer form, tutorial style chapters on applying deep learning techniques. This book covers Convolutional Neural Networks for computer vision, Recurrent and LSTM Neural Networks for natural language processing, transfer learning, and even generative models. 

If you read the 4 books above and combine them with some experience working on personal projects (ideally with messy data), then you will be in good shape. 

Other wonderful books: 

**Statistical Rethinking** by Richard McElreath 

[https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/1482253445/](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/1482253445/)

This book is a pragmatic introduction to Bayesian methods 

**Text Mining with R** by Julia Silge and David Robinson

[https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-R-Tidy-Approach/dp/1491981652/](https://www.amazon.com/Text-Mining-R-Tidy-Approach/dp/1491981652/) 

Super quick read. Covers text mining algorithms like sentiment analysis, tf-idf, latent dirichlet allocation, and more. Lots of examples, learn by doing style book. 

**Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python with Applications to Understanding Data** by John Guttag 

[https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python/dp/0262529629/](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python/dp/0262529629/r)

Fun read on the fundamentals of programming using python. This book follows MIT's 6.0001 and 6.0002 courses. The second half of the book covers a bunch of data science algorithms, and a lot of simulations. 

More to add another time!"

"A Turkish breakfast with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, cucumber, bread, white cheese, greek yoghurt and fried salami. My Turkish flatmates make this all the time, and now I'm obsessed. Very filling and you can prep the food the night before if needed."
