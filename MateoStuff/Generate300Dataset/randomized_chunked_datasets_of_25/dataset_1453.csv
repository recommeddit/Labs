64461,"I had a pair of Nike Zoomfly 2s that I absolutely loved, but I started training in them and they wore out incredibly quickly and caused some minor injuries because they were racing flats not proper training shoes (I was much newer to running/footwear at the time). Ultimately the people at my local running store and I reached the same conclusion you did. Nike makes some solid racing shoes, but in many instances they tend to lack when it comes to trainers. Now I just wear the Zoomflys because I like the way they look.",Best Nike running shoes

I'm currently looking for a laptop very similar to this [Zenbook 14""](https://www.amazon.com/Zenbook-NanoEdge-Ultra-Slim-Keyboard-NumberPad/dp/B08J7QBD7C/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-nc-drs1_0?cv_ct_cx=laptop&dchild=1&keywords=laptop&pd_rd_i=B08J7QBD7C&pd_rd_r=1a131a24-475f-4082-84f5-944ae6ad5686&pd_rd_w=gSJY1&pd_rd_wg=puWIi&pf_rd_p=a64002b9-9c26-4361-b8a1-b0f5a4835670&pf_rd_r=33Z5HDHCMJG8XGF3NB8T&psc=1&qid=1610057629&sr=1-1-38d0a374-3318-4625-ad92-b6761a63ecf6). I purchased this exact laptop; however, I've had to return it due to many technical issues with the laptop such as not waking up from sleep mode and bluetooth headphone connectivity issues. I absolutely love everything about the laptop and I really love the 1TB of memory! My budget, though, lies somewhere within a maximum of $1000-1200. The Zenbook is perfect for this because it is small, light, has a fantastic keyboard, and offers perfect specs. I'm just too scared to buy from Asus again though. Does anyone have anything in mind? Thank you so much in advanced!",best laptop for general use

26046,"I think most of them have strong convictions, a strong point of view, and a strong belief in what needs to be done to set Washington D.C. right. After all, you do not give up your life to go to a remote city (and have to obtain a second home in one of the most expensive cities in the country), leaving your family at home for weeks at a time, if you don't have a strong conviction and a strong civic desire to help the country.

(Most stories about how congress critters get wealthy off the public largess of their office simply don't happen; the ones we hear of are probably the exception than the rule.)

That said, I believe they all are lying like cheap rugs, only because some of their heartfelt convictions do not align with either the voters who voted for them, or the party under whose banner they ran.",best politician
