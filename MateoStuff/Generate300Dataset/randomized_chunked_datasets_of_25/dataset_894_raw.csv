"Polycarbonate is already highly UV resistant. Glass is a different story. If you are worried about a pair, have them tested at your optometrist. They have a machine that will tell you if they are safe to wear or not."
"Fedora would need to take getfedora.org into account, so it is likely much higher.."
What do you suggest after Applied Predictive Modeling? I've read that and intro to statistical modeling
"There are section that may be closed.

You may be able to hike in some areas.

North Carolina state parks have held New Years hikes the past few years. Not sure if they will do them this year."
"I currently use a [RAVPower USB C Battery Pack 20100](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019IFIJW8/ref=psdc_7073960011_t1_B01LRQDAEI) since it's USB-C and can power my MacBook (bought in 2017). If I were to buy a new one today though, I'd probably look at this [ZMI](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072BD98CM/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_3?smid=A30HYGGCHVCFDA&psc=1) since it's a bit thinner/lighter and the power output is higher."
"Yeah like why couldn't the friend buy the waffle maker for his own mom 

Was the op some kind of waffle maker dealer"
"Hello fellow non-morning person. I have one of these, it doesn't help me that much. It might work for you though!"
"I agree with you about whether the journalist actually read any of these books. Iâ€™ve read Neon Gods and found is largely underwhelming with multiple plot holes. It had a promising premise but didnâ€™t meet the expectations of it. 

I would have loved to see books like One Last Stop and Just Last Night on the list because theyâ€™re couple of the best books Iâ€™ve read this year."
"Witcher 3, ni no kuni , persona 5 and final fantasy 15."

The light bleed is pretty noticeable on dark scenes in games or movies but other than that no issues at all
Congratulations on your magnificent achievement. In this day and age of increasingly short attention spans what you have done is an example to us all. To take such a journey into the imagination of so many books must have been rewarding. It is certainly inspirational.  In the words of Ali G big yourself up.
"Save up for a C920, then you wonâ€™t have to get a new webcam for a long time. Also, invest in a cheap ring light. Lighting is often just as important as the camera itself, even a 1080p camera looks pixelated in poor lighting."
"Don't forget the copper mug, muhfucka!"
Why is m bytes better than the other free ones? I've tried a few like Avast avg they all seem the same
When you put it like that then being comfortable isn't a big factor in normal use.
"I skip the whitening toothpaste and use peroxide itself after brushing.  I let my teeth go for a long time because I'm a retard.  While they're still not movie-star white, they are back to the point of not being an embarrassment."
"If possible, cancel everything I'm going to do for the day.

Take vitamins.

Eat well and eat plenty.

Plenty of fluids. 

Rest. 

And Parks and Rec or The Office's earlier seasons."
"In my opinion, I think ......
1) IEM's that are around $100-$200 range have excellent value ie. VSonic GR07, Klipsch Image S4ii/X10
2) Portable headphones around the $200-$350 range ie. NAD Viso HP50, Sennheiser Momentum Over-Ear, Philips Fidelio line
3) Headphones for home-use in the $300-$400 range ie. Sennheiser HD600/650, Philips Fidelio X2"
"They know thereâ€™s a firearm in the bag since it was checked by TSA on the departure side. So the authorities know itâ€™s your bag and once you claim it on the arrival side you get arrested. Basically their argument is that you should know the rules of the state you are flying into. 

Happens with people driving through New Jersey as well. They donâ€™t recognize other states permits so if you are pulled over and caught with your handgun, youâ€™ll be arrested and charged with a felony. Itâ€™s actually a huge problem."
Right on.  But fetch does NOT do everything...it doesnâ€™t do upload progress.  That was my point.

This question should be asked more often
"Personally Iâ€™m using Zebra with Checkra1n. iOS 13.3.
Iâ€™d like to switch to Installer 5 because it have more options (like backing up sources etc), but I did not had time yet."
"> If you live in a 1st world country your tap water is very very safe 

Safe, maybe.  Drinkable, not necessarily.  I live in a town with pretty icky-tasting hard water.  Brita-type filters at least make the stuff more drinkable."
