"I also love Asics but they discontinued the Gel-1160 I was using for flat feet. I bought them 3 times in a row, and ran the last pair until the toes split open :("
Kurtis Conner as well is great! Him and those four are the ones I watch pretty often
"Jedit is good, there are lots of plugins for it. Also Notepad++."
"Saved your post in case i need it later, thanks for sharing

Imagine playing BioShock with enhance graphics and controller support...."
"Jamie Lee Curtis...she can turn the charm off and on like a light switch to the point that it's scary. If you are part of the ""peasantry"" be prepared to be completely ignored. I was in a 10' by 10' room with only her and I and I smiled and wished her good morning. I got no response, it was as if wasn't even there. Enter in someone of importance and suddenly she was all sweetness and light, but then this was back pre-Activia days so maybe she was constipated.

In a similar situation Tom Hanks, NICEST GUY EVER. Offered to get him some water or coffee and he'd have none of it. He said it wasn't my job to wait on him if I would just be nice enough to point him in the direction he'd help himself. And it wasn't like ""famous actor being nice to fan"", he just seemed like a genuinely nice, polite man."
Shout out to Charlie Garner who almost put up 1000/1000 that year.
"same. Finally got a 165hz monitor after years of using 60hz, difference is night and day"
"My professor has stated that I'm exceptionally promising. I think for me, it required really putting your code out there. You gotta fight a bit harder to make sure people really take you seriously. But I've been fortunate in working with an astounding CS professor who really treats women and men fairly."
"You drill holes in the bottom of one pot for the filters to screw into, and then set it on top of another pot the same size. Then drill a hole on the bottom pot for the spigot and that's it! There are tons of YouTube videos for diy Berkeys, we watched a lot of those before deciding what to get. We used two large stock pots but you can use 5 gallon food grade buckets too, even cheaper! We have had it about 3 or 4 years now and have barely cleaned the filters and still works like a champ. We use the fluoride and heavy metal filter attachments too. So I think altogether it was around $200 but we haven't spent a penny since! Totally worth it for the quality, nothing touches it"
"I didn't really like trick or treating so i would always give away candy while in costume, and like any good person would, i gave away all the shit candy and kept the good stuff for myself"

Where's the game benchmarks? They just named every CPU and their price.

The water at my house. I live in Alaska so I literally have pure glacial spring water running from my tap. Pretty great filtration system too.
"I agree so much with the romance book comment. I think people who don’t particularly like it assume it’s all just cheesy teenage garbage. And I respectfully disagree with your comment on CMBYN. I personally don’t view it as pedophilia because he was the age of consent, about to be done school, and Oliver was technically a second year college student. But to each their own. The movie definitely did not help this case by casting Armie Hammer though, it made it look way worse. I think the writing in the book itself is much better than the movie however, and is truly a work of art. I totally understand the power dynamics bit, it’s disappointing that we don’t have that much good healthy LGBT content to consume."
Kittle didn't play enough games to be considered for the top 10
Whatever happened to Quincy Promes? I do think Bergwijn could become a pretty good winger but he struggled for spurs last year
"Also, I doubt he is actually laughing his ass off.  Just a big fat phony, that guy!"
"You need an education, you need to put in some time working on political campaigns, and you need to start establishing contacts within the party of your choice.  It does not hurt if you have some military or business experience, and lots of money."
"That depends what you're playing, it's supposed to be at least 2,5 hours and up to 6"
"Eros, personally. I love the smell all around. With Dylan Blue, I do really like it, but...just like Sauvage, the top of the fragrance is really nice, but then there's just this weird undertone smell that turns me off. Id say Eros would be an every day, every situation fragrance. Dylan Blue can do the same thing, but I'd rather use it for more formal occasions."
