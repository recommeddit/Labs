37486,"I disagree. I think Disney is in trouble in Orlando. They are the obvious draw for international visitors, but Universal Orlando is catching up quickly here in the states. They have expanded wildly this decade and look to do even more in the next. Disney is now finding themselves playing catch up in trying to out-theme Potter, as it's become THE thing to see in Orlando for teens and millennials. I was driving to see Galaxies Edge this year and i drove past SeaWorld and saw Mako and wondered why the hell i'm not spending my day there. Plus Universal is about to open another park? Disney better look out.",best amusement park

30140,"I don’t know if calling this Imperialism makes sense in this context. All of the occupied territories were fringe territories of Mexico, with *extremely* few Mexicans actually living there.

I think it’s fair to call this imperialism with respect to the natives living there, but I don’t really see how Mexico would have the moral high ground since they (really Spain) basically did the same thing: just decided that this territory all belonged to them—not because their people lived there—but because they wanted the land. The effect of the war on most of the people living in those areas was to swap out one imperial overlord with another.",best Mexican war to study

No, you misunderstand.  Here's some reading material.

Logical positivism is dead:

> [Interviewed in the late 1970s, A J Ayer \[a major proponent of positivism\] supposed that ""the most important"" defect ""was that nearly all of it was false"".  ... John Passmore found logical positivism to be ""dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism)

**[Postpositivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositivism)** is the currently accepted approach.  It doesn't reject positivism, but rather amends it to include the soft sciences / social sciences.",best newspapers to read
