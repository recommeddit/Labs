8917,best toothpaste,"This might be partially because there is no such chemical as 'Fluoride' on its own, it refers to the F^- ion in chemicals such as Sodium Fluoride, which is often found in toothpaste and mouthwash."
36879,best roller coaster at six flags,I would assume so. I've done everything when there were no closures before.
30007,best money managing app,Zenmoney
5451,best home improvement store,"Other than issues with individual stores, not much different. Lowe's gives 10% discount to all vets, HD only retired military."
33765,best electric car,It seems odd to get a mustang whilst not liking noise and vibration. EVs definitely seem right up your alley. But silence and just power is too boring for me. Speed just isn't enough to make a ride interesting for me.
50691,best rap album,"Didn’t put a lotta thought into this tbh just looked through my most played songs so far this year. 

1. Best Album - None so far, hopefully TLOP5 after this Friday. 

2. Best beats - miss the rage, tell em by Cochise & snot, Pressure+Layers by bigbabygucci, nun 2 me by Kankan

3. Best features - Roddy Ricch on 4 da gang, EST GEE on real as it gets.

4. Best verses - I’m not the type to listen to hip hop for bars so idek.

5. Best hook - high as shit by ken car$on, never left by lil Tecca, ice water by lil skies 

1. Best album cover - 1 night i took acid by bigbabygucci

2. Worst album cover - not an album but miss the rage especially when compared to the og cover.

3. Favorite artist I’ve discovered - Definitely Ken Car$on, also didn’t discover them this year but I’ve gotten really into EST GEE and Kankan too. 

4. Album that ppl didn’t like but I did - Michigan Boat Boy, not that I loved it but I just think I appreciated what Yachty did a lot more than most people did. 

5. Most slept on album - definitely One night I took acid by bigbabygucci, fire album by a super underrated artist that unfortunately dropped the same day that J Cole did"
53660,best medicine for a cold,"Are you talking about meds in the same category, or different categories?  
In the same category, that's a no-no. Most of the adverse effects that would come with taking too much medication in too short of a period are generalizable to the mechanism of action of that entire class.  
In different categories, sure, but since it'd be targeting different symptoms, I'm not sure how much continued relief it would give you."

51182,best rap album,Pablo is better than Cruel Summer and Yeezus in my book.
19004,best YouTube video,"Yep, he changed it because he’s not doing Top 10’s anymore."
33872,best Pokemon game,"Hard to say which is best but I’d probably say platinum due to its challenge, pacing, and story being some of the best it’s been in the whole series. HG/SS, BW2, and Emerald are also great as well"
51258,best iphone case,Used multiple Spigen (mostly for different colors.)for my 11 Pro throughout. Well made case.
16941,best iOS game,"Opinions of forager...
I’m on the fence"
3282,best webcamera,"If you use slobs you can use their app to turn your phone in a stream deck. It's cute, but nothing more than a gimmick"
64875,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Derfs is my spot. Don’t hate.
62137,Best RPG game on PS4,"Star wars jedi fallen order, or FF15"
23808,best car racing video game,"For sim racing on PC:

**Assetto Corsa** is the best hotlapping simulation out there and with really good, true-to-life graphics, however it isn't a finished product and if you want to play online lots, you'll most likely need the Dreampack DLCs. Since most the active servers require them, bumping up the total price to around $35-$50 which is still solid value, considering you get around 10 fictional tracks and 5-7 laser scanned tracks, plus around 50 well detailed cars to choose from(mostly european). It's also a highly moddable sim, from tracks to cars to in-game apps, expect this game to blow up even more with time. There is a career mode but it's nothing amazing yet.

**Rfactor 2** is also another alternative with good graphics, said to have physics on par with AC, but more features to the sim itself. I have not played it yet, did play Rf1 with mods, which was a blast actually, though graphics are bit dated now.

**iRacing** is widely accepted as the best, most realistic online racing sim. Though it's really quite expensive, with monthly and content subscriptions. Expect to pay upwards of $200 a year. There are also a few weird, minor kinks in the physics engine, and graphics aren't exactly new but it shouldn't be a problem for majority of racers. It more than makes up for it with it's robust online network & its various parameters that separate good drivers from the bad nicely. Not to mention every single track you pay for, is laser scanned to what can only be described as perfection. There is also quite a gigantic userbase here, so you shouldn't ever have problems with inactivity online.

**Project cars** sets you back $60, full-retail price. Haven't played this too much. Racing is good fun, lots of options to tweak & and full-day/night cycle with dramatic weather changes. Some tracks are laser scanned, some aren't, but there are 30 tracks total. Graphics are great and there's a good dose of racecars, but modding is not supported and the game still has some physics bugs from Shift 2 present.

**Richard Burns Rally** If you're a die-hard rally fanatic. Simulation is top-notch, even for a 10 year old game, naturally graphics are dated. There are around 10 cars to choose from, but the real draw is the tracks. They are real, long and very challenging with the game's difficulty level quite steep and such a realistic physics engine. There are also several mods for this game.

And check out the new **Forza Apex** if you don't want to spend a dime on PC sim racing, though it is yet to receive wheel support and requires windows 10. We also don't know much about it as it's a fairly new game.

For more info on sims and comparisons, I recommend you check out Sim-oriented sites like [Racedepartment] (http://www.racedepartment.com/threads/driving-realism-of-ac-vs-iracing.97542/)

Other titles that I've heard good things about, but yet to delve into:

Game Stock Car Extreme

Dirt Rally

GTR2

Grid Autosport

---Honorable mentions:---

BeamNG Drive: While it's not a Sim racer, it certainly is a car Simulation, and a very realistic one at that. The best crash physics on the market. No doubt. This game, isn't a game, it's an on-going development of a physics engine and continues right off it's first game, Rigs of Rods, only with almost complete re-write of the physics engine. So this ""game"" you could say has been in development for 11 years. Since 2005. Modding community is also very creative and the game comes with a built-in map editor for making scenarios(missions) and maps. Very cool game if you have a top-notch PC and just like crashing cars, planes, helicopters and anything else that is churned out by the modding community. It's only $20-$30.

64577,Best Nike running shoes,"They're all great from my experience, but you should test them out and see which works best for you.

The LunarEpic 2, though, having been replaced by that Epic React, is normally pretty cheap these days. You could probably buy two or three pairs from the Nike Factory store (or elsewhere) for the price of either of the other two, so if you like that more, that's what I would do."
54539,best artisan mousepad alternatives,How much faster is a shidenkai over a raiden? Any hard pads to compare to?
37273,best amusement park,"Probably due to the residents there wanting to go to SoCal on vacation, and then they consider Knott's Berry Farm as a stop. Knott's does pop up on a lot of SoCal itineraries."
2780,best headphones,A bad idea. It's not good which is why it's not on the list.
4107,best online college,"I was going to say the [BS in software engineering](https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/penn-state-online-software-engineering-bachelors-degree/overview) from Penn State World Campus, but that's expensive. And there's an online master's in computer science from Georgia that's a good deal, but that's a masters... Maybe the computer science bachelor's from [UMUC](https://www.umuc.edu/academic-programs/bachelors-degrees/computer-science-major.cfm).

Have you considered the Lambda School? It sounds interesting but I don't know a whole lot about it. In general I recommend online programs from major universities, but there are a lot of intriguing offerings out there especially at the certificate level."
73470,best battery bank,"Not sure what devices you have, but if you have an iPhone, Belkin makes power banks that charge with a lightning port instead of micro USB, which could mean one other cable to carry."
