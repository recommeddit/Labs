"What would you say are the biggest differences between the two?  I've seen a fair amount more about the zero, almost nothing about the otsu."
If you do go the aquatic route make sure you learn about tank cycling and proper tank size. It would have saved me a lot of tears and dead fish if my parents had done any sort of research and cycled the tank before plopping a betta or guppies in there. :)
Itâ€™s not. At least not in the North where I grew up.

Hi! [I'd look at my gaming laptop list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/hjaude/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_july_2020/) The Acer Nitro 5 with an RTX 2060 is the best value in this price range.
"Mid-20s, likely a woman, early on in your career path and you like going out (not a party monster but a good time out is necessary). Smelling cozy and warm is a must with a hint of edge and sophistication when going out."

I just bought the 34 ultrawide version of your monitor. It's my first gaming monitor too (I've been gaming since 1984) and I couldn't be more excited.
"I've played maybe 10 hrs. It's a lot of fun, but I can't give the best review. Graphics can throw you off a bit but easy to get use to.  The characters are enjoyable and remind me of dragon quest games. Tons o' fun though. Lots of side activities to do like raising little spirit creatures and squad-based war tactics."
"If you're into comic books I have a book full of action that's  on Kickstarter right now -

"Sausage links, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  Always get that when I go to a diner for breakfast."
"Great list!!! Arso??! ðŸ˜³ well, I think I must try to wear it in my city... Maybe there is a chance at least one human will like it without questionable thoughts."
"I really wanted to be THE epic adventure movie I wished but they took another route to set the ""monsterverse"" with Godzilla. If they rather went with the same uncharted, monster-filled skull island that appeared in King kong, the story could be a franchise on it's own. 

The giant insects pit -of doom- is still my favorite scene. Btw, the extended version of King Kong show several extra minutes of Skull island's wildlife."
I canâ€™t even tell the difference. I guess my eyes are getting blurry.
"Blindsgalore.com also has really good deals, especially during the holidays. This site is my favorite because they have custom sizing, where a lot of sites like Lowe's or others often only have select sizes. Although I've never tried Select Blinds, so maybe it's worth looking into!"
"Its a very undersold drink, I agree. I have a different recipe from my bartending days though.

1oz Malibu
1oz Midori
.5oz Banana Liquor
Splash on Bacardi 151
Top with even portions of heavy cream and pineapple juice 

and Viola! Lets drink!"

"I have a couple i choose from depending in the trip:
-	Anker PowerCore Fusion 5000 is a combo plug/battery
-	Anker Power Lite 10000 for times when thereâ€™s a good chance Iâ€™ll be away from a socket all day"
"Even middle class bags have the lock attached to the bag these days, so you couldn't close it without actually opening the lock. While totally possible, it's a lot more time consuming."
