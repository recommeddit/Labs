28923,best breakfast foods,"My bf has been making amazing bacon-wrapped egg muffins for breakfast each week. Set oven to 375 degrees. Wrap bacon around the edge of each muffin cup. Crack an egg in the middle and whisk. Top it off with cheddar, chives and/or bacon bits if you wish. Then pop in the oven for 25 minutes. If you make them on Sunday, it's enough for the rest of the work week. Easy, delicious and healthy!"

4495,best text editor,"VS Code is the best. IntelliJ runs very poorly on my system (people say Java is fast, but it really isn't)."
39381,best web browser,Currently using stock EDGE Faster and Lighter. Was using chrome for years
23575,best car racing video game,"I was never really a fan of Porsche as a brand, but I LOVED this game and it really gave me an appreciation for them. 

This was my immediate thought reading this post. The hard, long progression really made you appreciate minor differences between seemingly very similar cars and I formed real bonds with the cars I had, valuing each of them. A world away from the Forza experience described here."
63813,best books for building better habits reddit,"Thanks for the advice!  I will try adding the walk to the tea routine in the morning for sure.  The ""only using the bed for sleep"" suggestion will be more of a challenge.  

As for blue screen light, I use the Twilight app, and it's amazing.  I don't get eyestrain anymore.  I love it."
10070,best pencil for drawing,"Mitsubishi makes the best pencils I've ever used, the Hi-Uni. They're also extremely expensive; however, the Uni 2mm leadholder refills are very affordable and extremely good quality.

For softer, sketching pencils, I like General's Layout pencils (very black). Any of the common brands like Staedtler, Faber-Castell, Derwent, General's, etc. are good quality drawing pencils overall. I like Staedtler and Tombow the best for detailed drawing, they seem extremely consistent."

66011,best college in california,"Great to see as a UCLA alum.  I got into Berkeley also but I didn't like the vibe as much. Also their admissions rep really put me off by answering most of the questions by saying ""a degree from Berkeley is worth its weight in gold."" 

Ok

And good job with UCI for climbing up and consistently showing itself to be the other dominant university in the LA/OC area."

51863,best iphone case,"I can vouch for Otterbox, their cases are incredible. I’ve recommended Otterbox to countless people.  I dropped my phone down the stairs once, it fell down one flight, bounced off the wall then around a corner and down another, phone was as good as new!"
67917,best science fiction novel,Make sure you read the Endymion books too :) they're sooo good

61680,Best RPG game on PS4,Most underrated game of all time ( it's very hard tho... I've warned you)
37713,best Marvel movie,"Best (tie): 

Winter Soldier

Infinity War

Endgame

GOTG 1

So many good movies to choose from. It was hard not to put more solo films at the top but these are the ones I consider top teir. 


Worst:

Iron Man 3 

This movie could not exist and the MCU would essentially be unchanged. Contradicts a lot previous and subsequent character arc with Tony. Shits all over Mandarin character. This movie is a slap in the face to Iron Man fans. 

Worst Runnerup: 

Thor Dark World"
33319,best electric car,"The Nissan Leaf's recent price cuts combined with its continued eligibility for the federal tax credit make it an incredible value in the US*.

*assuming you're fine with chademo, live in a temperate climate, and have another car for road trips or rent a car for trips."
13740,best research paper archive,"While it's labeled under the ""duh, of course that's important"" category by most people, it really is a well written document that explains a good idea quite painlessly.

Here is another gem, where Einstein derives E=mc^2, ""[Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy-content?](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/e_mc2.pdf)""

It's extremely short too."
55714,best action and adventure novel series,"Came here to recommend this, whole-heartedly agree."
47304,best state to visit in the United States,"Nah, though I wouldn't encourage it if OP wants to see something different."
33225,best electric car,"Definitely aware of Tesla's QC problems and they definitely concern me. I'm hoping they get better with time. But QC is also one of the reasons I am more interested in the Model 3 than the Y. It seems they have more time to improve their processes and issues the longer the car is on the market. Granted, a lot of these issues would probably be avoidable with better QC in the first place..."
5174,best home improvement store,"I sent Lowe's an email a couple years back showing how their search feature is inferior and how HD (at the time, not now) showed aisle locations and they did not.  They replied telling me that their market research showed that people tended to be happier when they wandered around and browsed.  I don't know if it's true or not, but it went 100% contrary to what I wanted so I stopped going to Lowe's (and for a few other reasons)."
