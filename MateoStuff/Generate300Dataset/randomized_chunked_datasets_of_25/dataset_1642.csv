Top it off with cheddar, chives and/or bacon bits if you wish. Then pop in the oven for 25 minutes. If you make them on Sunday, it's enough for the rest of the work week. Easy, delicious and healthy!",best breakfast foods

10070,"Mitsubishi makes the best pencils I've ever used, the Hi-Uni. They're also extremely expensive; however, the Uni 2mm leadholder refills are very affordable and extremely good quality.

For softer, sketching pencils, I like General's Layout pencils (very black). Any of the common brands like Staedtler, Faber-Castell, Derwent, General's, etc. are good quality drawing pencils overall. I like Staedtler and Tombow the best for detailed drawing, they seem extremely consistent.",best pencil for drawing

So many good movies to choose from. It was hard not to put more solo films at the top but these are the ones I consider top teir. 


Worst:

Iron Man 3 

This movie could not exist and the MCU would essentially be unchanged. Contradicts a lot previous and subsequent character arc with Tony. Shits all over Mandarin character. This movie is a slap in the face to Iron Man fans. 

Worst Runnerup: 

Thor Dark World",best Marvel movie

It seems they have more time to improve their processes and issues the longer the car is on the market. Granted, a lot of these issues would probably be avoidable with better QC in the first place...",best electric car
5174,"I sent Lowe's an email a couple years back showing how their search feature is inferior and how HD (at the time, not now) showed aisle locations and they did not.  They replied telling me that their market research showed that people tended to be happier when they wandered around and browsed.  I don't know if it's true or not, but it went 100% contrary to what I wanted so I stopped going to Lowe's (and for a few other reasons).",best home improvement store
