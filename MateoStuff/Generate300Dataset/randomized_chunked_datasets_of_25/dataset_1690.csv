12588,best gifts for mom,"I'm pretty sure ""You're no child of mine"" is quite clear."
28348,best breakfast foods,"Weekdays if I get out of bed right when I wake up and don't sit there having some water thinking about how the hell 5:15 is an actual time that exists, I grab a bowl of cereal with a splash of milk and half a banana. If not I grab a piece of fruit on the way out and eat it at 7:30 when we have a bit of a lull. 

Weekends are for bagels with either some cream cheese or with traditional breakfast sandwich toppings because I live somewhere that has good bagels."
53619,best medicine for a cold,"Yes. Cetirizine makes about 10-15% of the population drowsy still. Loratadine less so, and Fexofenadine even less."
56910,best water brand,Essentia is the shit.
33431,best electric car,"Disagree. A drivable concept car is a big step towards production over a CGI demo.

GM doesn't have better capacity to deliver on battery production, electric drive train, or an effective charging network, which Tesla already has in place."
12031,best gifts for dad,"Why? He already got the bike.

Time to move on to the girl with the dad that collects classic cars."
20106,best workout music,"fuck waiting for you to get it on your own

60833,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Kathleen Madigan (Again) 
 
That's the name of the special. 
 
You will not regret it. Most of this special is about her journey (along with Lewis Black) to entertain at the USO in in 2008 and it's *fucking hilarious*. If she doesn't make you laugh, you might want to go get checked out."
64048,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"you have to get a download plugin or you have to do this.

On your browser you hit the right mouse button and click inspect element.  Then you'll see stuff at the bottom of the page.

I use firefox, so when I do this I see ""Network"" at the bottom of the page.  Click on that and then click on Media and Other.

Now what you do is you open a new page with the audiobookx site.  You find whatever book you want, then you copy the link and then paste it to the inspect element page.

When doing this you then will see 1 link pop up at the bottom of the page with GET next to it.  Right click on that or double click it to open it or right click it and click OPEN IN ANOTHER TAB.

Then your book will start playing...then just right click on that page where the audiobook is playing and click download."
60085,best perfume,I've  been to a lot of perfume shops and I've  never seen them. He used to be one of my favorite artists until I  read Black Dahlia Avenger.
16126,best sunglasses for fashion,https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/710qq7/aooko_rundown_ultimate_guide/
16556,best pet for toddlers,My male cat used to do this when he was younger and lived mainly outside. The older he's gotten the less interest he's seemed to having in catching things. My female is scared of her own shadow and wont even kill bugs.
4402,best text editor,"Have you tried the vim mode plugin for VSCode, it would solve that problem... I had it too"
15881,best sunglasses for fashion,RayBan New Wayfarers and Persol aviators have been in my rotation as of late. Always in tortoiseshell.
61708,Best RPG game on PS4,"With Persona 5, it might be good for you to know it is *very* cut-scene heavy. That may be fine with you, but I didn't know that when I bought it and after a half-hour of cut-scenes at the very beginning of the game I became frustrated because I really wanted to just *play the game*. I ended up trading it in and when I asked about this online people said ""oh yeah, it has *a ton* of cut scenes"". Something I wish I had known before I bought it."
58299,best cologne,"Anyone a fan of fahrenheit?

I like the scent when it's diffused but when it's starting out it reeks of gasoline."
57243,best water brand,Spring

8389,best toothpaste,"Also, not a dentist, but I wouldnâ€™t recommend putting cavity prevention toothpaste in your eyes"
68546,best science fiction novel,there is a ton of fantastic sci fi coming out. Really great stuff.
4549,best text editor,"Seems Microsoft's entry into the open-source world is a bit misguided, and not really true to the most basic open-source principles of who they are trying to target. I have seen many similar exchanges on GitHub with the dotnet project, and apparently it is not isolated to that team.

Willful ignorance is really the only explanation, as surely they are able to understand that people might think many of their practices are a bit shady.  They are undoubtedly intelligent and talented devs, just don't care about their customers privacy rights apparently. 

Hmm, making me do some reconsidering as far as simply disabling telemetry now. Will probably be using the VSCodium build scripts to do myself, if nothing else, just out of principle."
42866,best detective show,"Netflix:
The pharmacist
The sinner
Mind hunter
The killing

Showtime:
Outcry

HBO:
True detective"
35920,best alcoholic drink,I tried bloody Mary's once I used pretty horrible vodka though. Popov I figured all the good things would make the shit vodka taste good.... It didn't and killed my work out the next day. But a better brand of vodka and club soda does sound like a good idea.
901,best desk lamp,"Z-Bar. It built with LEDs, will actually last for L in BIFL.
