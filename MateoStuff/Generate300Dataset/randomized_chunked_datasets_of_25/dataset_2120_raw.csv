Season 3 was great too
It’s fine to exclude him. He posted revenge porn to Twitter of the mother of his child. He’s trash.
I loved that series as a teen! Dmitri and Rose were just perfect!

"To mention a few artists I haven't seen listed yet:

30 or Monopoly or Dance in the Water - Danny Brown

Big Beast - Killer Mike

Get Back - Luda

Also for the record Work Bitch by Britney Spears is the ultimate workout song"
The most real thing I've heard was when a Swiss rep of a university came to visit my highschool a few years ago was that he was shocked by how expensive Evian was here when in Switzerland the price is the same as the local water here.
"No, obviously if I have visible dirt hand sanitizer won't work well. I was referring to particles and residue you don't see that is still on your hand when you use hand sanitizer. 

I thought it was worth posting because I see too many people using hand sanitizer instead of washing their hands with soap and water."
"I tutor math and can go through pencils. I've found these to be the most reliable, and they last for years. I tend to lose them before ever wearing them out. I love the .9mm because it never breaks under pressure like the .7mm can.

"1) My soda stream.

I like carbonated water - it’s about all I drink. High end soda stream from value village was $15, bottles and canisters have paid for themselves a dozen times over.

2) cloth diapers for my 2 month old son. Turns out he hates being wet, and we can easily go through 20 diapers a day. I’m sure we saved hundreds on disposables already. (Got my cloth diapers 2nd hand. Net cost is $0 because they can be re-sold after for the same as what I paid so long as I look after them)."
Comment removed per rules #9 and #1.
"It's a legitimate answer.  Many consider him the GOAT defensive player or GOAT pass rusher.  If you value that highly, it could affect your decision on who is the greatest player.

Also, there is his influence as a player even outside of what he did on the field.  He revolutionized free agency."
"Kill Bill 2 when she finds Bill

Nothing even comes close"
"If you find yourself ever carrying say a 20k instead of a 10k or something that needs a 30 watt charger instead of the 18 watt. 

  The [Rav power GaN](https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-pc120-gan-tech-type-c-charger?variant=30213707235403) charger comes in at 59 grams on my scale and has folding plugs. It is a 5 gram weight penalty over the [Anker Power Port Atom PD1](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powerport-atom-pd-1/A2017121) which comes in at 54 grams on my scale but no folding plugs."

Hey! Deadpool was fairly fun.
Create an algorithm and then state that it must run on a non-deterministic turing machine.
"Penicillin and the ones closest to it cause me to have anaphylaxis, which we learned when they gave it to me as an newborn and I stopped breathing. During my toddler years, they tried a few more on me and I kept getting hives or rashes and sometimes had difficulty breathing. When I was young, they did an allergy test with my blood and determined that I was allergic to all the ones they tested for, in varying degrees. There are some I can take for a little while, but I can’t finish a full course. All this information came second hand from my mother, as I was too young to hear it from the doctor. 

I should probably go and get another blood test done to see if that’s still an accurate assessment, but my family doctor, who worked very closely with the pediatrician responsible for these tests, still has only very reluctantly prescribed one type, and has insisted that I take two Benadryl with each dose, and I’m inclined to follow her lead as far as what I shouldn’t have."
"Thank you so much for compiling this! My wishlist will never get cleared now lol. Also, I'm surprised Nalini Signh didn't make the cut!"
"Well for one it's not entirely supported across all browsers as it's a relatively new browser API. If you are strictly working in chrome it's not a big deal. Once you move into ie or safari then you need polyfills and such.

You have to keep in mind that not every app can just be like, hey go download chrome 75 and use that only heh the fact of the matter is that people don't update their browsers or OS when they are not devs or more advanced tech users for example."
I’ve been wanting to see this comic develop since I first saw it
Y'all got problems man
"There a lot of players, and a few RBs, who should be ahead of Brown"
"I understand that but if my listening were to be of a similar volume I don’t think I’d absorb enough of each project to talk about ranking. This is all out of curiosity, clearly there is very different types of music consumption out there."
