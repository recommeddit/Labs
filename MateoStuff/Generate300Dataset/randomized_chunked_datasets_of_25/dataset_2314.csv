57747,"I think there's a lot of truth to what you're saying, although I still believe people when they say they're getting unsolicited compliments. 

I haven't received too many compliments from people that I wasn't close to, like you're suggesting, but I have noticed that women are often a lot friendlier to me when I'm wearing a fragrance.
