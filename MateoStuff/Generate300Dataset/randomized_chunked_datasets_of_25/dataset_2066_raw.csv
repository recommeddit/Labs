"Why is this and why does it matter?

I hear CO people are generally nice?"
I saw someone recommend this website - [https://www.theearthawaits.com/](https://www.theearthawaits.com/)  I think it will help you out.
"I’ve only ever had terrible experiences with Bradford pear trees—had them in FL and TX and they’ve only ever grown in weird shapes, get diseases, and seem to die quickly and easily with fragile branches and brittle bark. Just had one cut down, it was dropping branches on our car and was diseased and damaged from winter storms. They’re overly popular ornamentals IMHO.

I’d go with Northern Acclaim® thornless honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos var. inermis ‘Harve’), a seedless and quick growing legume with dappled shade, so it’s great for being in the middle of lawns (adds nitrogen and lets in sunlight), good for OP’s climate. Tuns a pretty yellow. Otherwise, a native like hackberry or service berry which looks pretty and works well there too and is great for birds."
+1 on BM Regal/Aura. I use Sherwin Williams Emerald but only because there's an SW store in town and the nearest BM is 40 miles away.
"There's also Brave, another privacy focused Chromium skin."

"Most do it to save money. I know many people who’s only electronic device is their phone, they use it for everything including tv. They save a lot of money by minimizing tech."
"I've seen a lot of threads about the best text editor, but not about the best Windows text editor. Just curious as to what you all use when you use Windows."
"Read the WSJ, and NYT both have insanely good reporters and editorial staff, the ""truth"" is somewhere in the middle. 

What a lot of people miss is that the real bias exists in what stories you choose to cover, not how you cover them. WSJ tends to cover stories that push a more conservative view point, while the NYT does the same with a more liberal view point. The stories they choose to cover they cover well, but the bias exists in which stories they devote resources to. 

If you read both of those papers every day, you'll be about as close to having a balanced outlook as you can get. 

If you want to go to ""pro - level"" throw in the National Review, Economist, Forgien Policy, The Hill, and The Diplomat. They'll go more in depth with really good analysis."
"+1 for you. I was going to recommend these, but I couldn't remember the name. I love these so much. Classic wayfarer shape without looking like you're trying too hard to be hip."

There's an Expert mode?!"
What are your thoughts on the one person architecture firm?  Obviously you'd be restricted to small projects.  I've seen some of the contracts for houses and small restaurants and if one or two people could do one or two projects a year it seems like that could be viable.
Why do you keep wearing it

"She likes when I make homemade stuff.  I've made pajamas, robes, pillowcases, duvet covers, etc.  Presents for her cats are always a bit hit, too.  I got her a cats a big carpeted tower a few years ago."
"In fact it works quite well on Cygwin, Linux subsystem for Windows 10, Raspberry Pi and Termux."
UCSC is getting up there. It climbs every year but it's not quite elite tier yet.
"i found cap TFA a bit boring honestly, hated the character of cap until the russos upgraded him in winter soldier. i also cant believe homecoming is so low on here, its better than guardians 2 for sure."
I'm curious about how you accent a warm color with other warm accents and it doesn't look like some awful clash (red/orange or yellow/orange are all I can think of)
Swedish Fish? Nobody's going to ask about Swedish Fish? WTF is that ?
"There are tons, but some of the one's I have now are English Laundry Oxford Bleu( it is like a toned down Eros with the slightest touch of BDC), Clinique Happy(One of my all-time fav summer scents), Ferragamo Black, English Laundry Arrogant(it smells like a cross between Le Male and something else familiar. Can't quite put my finger on it), John Varvatos(all except one or two are great), Grey Flannel, and last but not least JPG Le Male( I got my 3.4 bottle for something like 25. I got two seperate English Laundry sets, both with 4 bottles 1 oz each. Most of them are great for just a quick grab for something different. There was only one or two I didn't care for. Tahitian Waters my daughter loved. I HATED it. Smelled like chemical and feet with some other nasty smell mixed in. The two listed above were pretty great. The other's were take or leave, but were overall pretty well made, just not really my cup o' tea."
