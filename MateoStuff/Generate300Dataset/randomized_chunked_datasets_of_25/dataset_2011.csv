I know NFS has always been the arcade-y racing series but Heat took it to a whole other level with the ""release the gas and press it again to enter drift mode"" thing. It felt *awful* to drive like that, and I couldn't find anyway to disable it so I had to just uninstall.

Edit: Seems there is an option to toggle it off now? Definitely wasn't a thing when it first came out 'cause I even searched online for an answer to this. Perhaps I'll give it another go now.",best car racing video game

55570,"> I don't personally understand how HP has adult appeal.

“Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.” - C.S. Lewis

(Harry Potter is read by far too many adults for someone to validly suggest it doesn't have adult appeal, whatever that is. ""Having spent eighteen years upwards alive"" as a trait is too broadly distributed to be useful as a distinguishing factor.)

Your argument is resistant to outside interference for the most part - HP cannot be good because you do not think it's good - though the bit where HP got popular *because* it was popular is pretty ludicrous circular logic. Harry Potter was Rowling's debut work; she was a single mother living on state welfare while she wrote it, and it was rejected by several publishers before someone took a chance on it. It started out *not* popular, but became so on its own merits.

Popularity is not a yardstick to measure quality by, but there are certain qualities a work must possess to become wildly popular in the first place. If one could easily replicate those qualities, tons of talented authors, I'm sure, would write at least one wildly popular book to become financially set for life and then move on to writing ""good"" books.",best action and adventure novel series
