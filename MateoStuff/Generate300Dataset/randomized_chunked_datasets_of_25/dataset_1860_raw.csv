"I'm actually a dentist.  My personal recommendation as well as what I always use at home is Colgate Total.  Behoove was correct in that it contains Triclosan, which is an antibacterial agent. Colgate currently has a patent on it in toothpaste form.

There was a time when Colgate Total's FDA approval was still pending in the US, and dentists would drive across the border to Canada to bring back this toothpaste. Really.

I get inundated with samples of Crest Pro-Health.  I'll buy the Colgate instead.

On the other hand, the best toothpaste is the one you'll use most!  If its disgusting, or makes you feel like the first layer of skin cells on your cheeks  are sloughing off, you won't use it, therefore it won't work as well.

Hope that helps...."

Kourtney 
Kendall 
Kylie 
Kris"
Stories please
"As someone who is allergic to ALL antibiotics (seriously, I have a reaction to ALL of them), getting ill can sometimes be really serious for me, and it forces my family doctor to be really clever sometimes. The amount of times an unfamiliar nurse or pharm tech has been confused that I’m not just taking an antibiotic for something is astounding, and it honestly makes me wonder at our dependency as a society on antibiotics."
"Well usually I play more with local meetups and local conventions. Faiyum definitely doesn’t replace Concordia in any way, the only similarity is playing one card a turn and taking a turn to gain your cards back. It’s definitely more interactive than the race elements in Concordia."
Room temperature Tap if you can get it.
"I read it a while ago and I thought it was on the list, but I had gotten it from another one. I thought it was an interesting work of art and I never want to force myself through a book like that again."
"Fish are work. A lot of work. All of them need a cycled tank. None are suitable for bowls. Goldfish need a friend and at least 40 gallons of water. Bettas need at least 2.5 gallons of water and a heater. Fish aren't easy and it's so tempting for little ones to put their hand in the tank. If they leave the lid off, the fish can jump out and kill themselves.

10/10 do not recommend fish.

Source: own 5+ tanks of varying sizes"
"I just get Apple care. I am way more concerned with how thin and easy it is to bend. If anything,a case for back to keep that from ever happening. Mine definitely has bend at this point. Not enough to matter,but it’s bent a little. I usually have nothing on it,because keyboard folio is annoying if your not using it"
Put the ondoh on three-hundoh
Utterly heartwrenching.

Its the only candy with the cookie crunch!
Yes! My husband and I argued about the sequencing the entire time. I was going crazy and he liked it. It was so interesting but infuriating to follow. I came away feeling like I knew less about basketball because it confused the timeline so much!
Right? That comment confused the fuck out of me since the *cheap* cookware sets i find are easily 60-100. I'd be expecting 200 probably
Yes!! How can they make water taste chalky?! So gross!
What's the main use case for it?
"Sweet potato hash! Fry up a sweet potato along with a handful of any veggies you've got - I usually like mushrooms, peppers, a bit of onion, but anything works. Scramble an egg and throw it in, maybe some crumbled bacon, and always minced garlic. Usually season with cumin, a little cayenne pepper."
"""Boom full size Snickers! Who does that?! Tell all your friends where you saw that shit. I'll break your fuckin' bag with my candy!"""
Wish they had a transparent version
"Nice thanks for the link, my moms dream is to go here with me and maybe my sister and she grew up dirt poor in a 3rd world country so she deserves something nice but I had no money and time cause of work. By next year should have more time especially once things reopen..."
Yes sir. I think the reason they do it is so that potential new members see the gym as  being a high energy / fun place. But I agree. I've had to double my volume on my device when I'm at the gym to block out their music.
Yes I do
Lowe’s is my preference because I find the customer service better opposed to Home Depot not sure if that’s consistent because I really only go to the one nearest my house.  Prices are pretty similar but each run decent deals throughout the year.  I did my carpet upstairs through Home Depot because of the free install.
