8804,"If you're doing that, it just means you're brushing ***far*** too hard. You're almost certainly scarring your gums and wearing micro-fissures into your enamel. You need to just focus your mind on being more gentle when you brush. A typical ***Soft-bristled*** brush head should last you 3-4 months. You should not use anything more stiff than soft bristles. 

An electric toothbrush will probably help you, though, simply because you don't need to do any brushing motion at all when using one. You just hold it against your teeth and let its movement do the cleaning for you, taking care to reach all the different parts and sides of your mouth and teeth.

I would personally recommend that, when you buy an electric toothbrush, you bring it with you to your dentist and ask them to show you how to use it properly. If you're still holding it too forcefully against your teeth, it will do damage.",best toothpaste

Normally I focus on the broadsheets - The Times, the Telegraph, the Guardian and the FT from time to time, but more and more the Independent.

8125,"I got mine years ago at a Kroger in a small town.. so probably yes.

It has totally changed my dental cleanings... before the Sonicare I was usually scheduled for 30-45 minutes because I just wasn't that good at brushing and can't get it together to floss (partly because my teeth are close together). Now it always takes 15 minutes.. they still admonish me about flossing but I'm always amazed when we're done.",best toothpaste
15448,"Chionanthus retusis! PLEASE! 

Very underutilized tree; great orange fall color, beautiful bark and nice branch architecture, and great white spring flower. 

Very very drought tolerant. 

If you want the native, Chionanthus virginicus, it needs clay acidic soil; I think you’d be better off with the Chinese one, but even the Chinese one isn’t aggressive and won’t become invasive. 

Great great tree. Highly recommend.",best tree for the garden

4155,"Here's a nice text editor benchmark on [github](https://github.com/jhallen/joes-sandbox/tree/master/editor-perf).

I started with notepad++ on WinXP and when sublime text came out in 2008 I've used that every day.

My favorites are:

1. Sublime text
1. Vim
1. VS Code
1. Jetbrains IDE

I use them all equally as they're tools to get a task done.

Sublime for scratch.txt, a fast launch and browsing tons of files.

Vim for editing text and running macros or opening 1 GB text files quickly. Vim > sublime for performance.

I'm writing this in VS Code w/ markdown preview. And for a live preview of LaTeX.

Regular expressions are 100% the same in sublime and VS code (and I think Jetbrains too).

I've made all my 4 editors follow hotkeys from Jetbrains (Intellij, GoLand). 

| key      | action           |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| ctrl + y | delete line      |
| ctrl + d | duplicate line   |
| ctrl + w | expand selection |
| ctrl + 4 | close tab        |
| alt + 1  | toggle side bar  |",best text editor
