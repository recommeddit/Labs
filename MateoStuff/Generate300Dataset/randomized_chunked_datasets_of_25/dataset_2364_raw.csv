"You can use Parallels or Fusion to load up windows from your Boot Camp partition. The best of both worlds!

There's even a mode where windows don't have to be encapsulated by the Windows desktop, so it looks like it's just running in the OS X environment."

"Brawl Stars is super fun and super polished and avoids the trappings of F2P games- with this game you are looking forward to the gameplay rather than dailies / premium currency / etc. There really aren't those cheap flashy visuals and pop-ups to create a dopamine rush, just very well done modeling and comic book style artwork. You can easily get a character up to 500 trophies, which is considered the beginning of the meta for them, at their base power (you can increase their power over time through loot boxes.) It's surprisingly f2p friendly, you can easily rank high without spending anything. This comes from a 2 year + player."
Honestly I’m not sure what there is to do in ones spare time in a state like WV. I also imagine it’s the least contributive of the non-Ohio Kings Island base. It’s relatively pretty when driving through though on the way to Ohio. Guess I’ll have to check out Camden Park one day. It’s just hard to veer off the major interstates when traveling through these random states.

Thanks for the response. Considering buying one in about a month and that was really my only concern.

"So, these rankings aren't purely done on park quality, but also on distance. I would read each description thoroughly. 

1) Busch Gardens Williamsburg: Fantastic coaster collection, great food/drinks, catchy music, great entertainment, and looks beautiful. You are transported into a new European country with each section. Overall an amazing atmosphere and one of the top parks in America. Plus, there's a lot to do in Williamsburg.

2) Hersheypark: Is it a bit further but is a really charming park with a top notch collection of 13 coasters, including some world class ones like Skyrush and Storm Runner. It's also pretty in most areas too, and you have a zoo and Hershey's Chocolate World right on site. You're getting the full package with it.

3) Kings Dominion: Has about as good of a coaster lineup as Hershey. I305 and Twisted Timbers are two of the most insane coaster experiences you're going to get. Besides the coasters, it has a really good flat ride collection and is shaded in most areas, but doesn't have much for non-thrill seekers. Still, it's a great place to spend a day and is right off of I-95.

4) Cedar Point: This park is only this low if driving six hours from DC is a hassle. Otherwise, Cedar Point is the best amusement park in the country (emphasis on ""amusement"" and not ""theme"": it's an extremely thrill-oriented park). It has the best coaster lineup in my opinion, with 17 roller coasters. The best and most insane ones are Maverick, Top Thrill Dragster, Millennium Force, and the recently-opened Steel Vengeance. You still have many more that would make most parks' top 5s. Besides the coasters, there is a plethora of thrilling flat rides, and other activities in area such as the nearby beach. You will also get great views on some of the rides. 

5) Knoebels: This is a more laid back, family-style park, but it's still fantastic. There are only a handful of good roller coasters but this park is incredibly quirky, shaded, and there are a LOT of activities to do there outside of them. Food is some of the best at any park, too. Something to note- admission is free, but you pay per-ride. Is slightly farther than Hershey.

6) Dollywood: Think of it as Busch Gardens quality but themed to the south. It's ranked this low because it's also several hours away, but it is a must visit. Fantastic theming, food, coasters (Lightning Rod holy shit) and music are rolled into one.

7) Six Flags Great Adventure: This park has El Toro, one of the greatest coasters ever built. It is a must ride for any coaster fan. It also has the tallest and second fastest roller coaster in the world, Kingda Ka. It also has Nitro, a very fun B&M hyper. Besides that? This park isn't that good. The rest of the coasters range from alright to pretty bad (and are mostly clones), but the big turnoff is how unimpressive it is to be in. It's dirty, not well shaded, is plastered in advertisements, and has mediocre food. If you want to do El Toro and Kingda Ka that badly it's worth it to visit once, but if you want a full park experience, you won't find it here.

8) Other PA parks: These include Kennywood, Dorney Park, and Waldameer. They have one standout roller coaster each (although Phantom's Revenge is considered to be amazing) but none are on El Toro's level and none of the three offer anything special either to travel a few hours to.

9) Six Flags America: Bad park overall. Sort of unpleasant to be in and has a mediocre coaster lineup. It is however the closest to you, but it's much more worth it to drive more to a better park."
