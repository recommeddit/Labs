A few points: 

BSN RNs want to largely exclusively work in hospitals.  This is because the pay is better and clinical experience is more rigorous then Long Term Care/Skilled Nursing Facilities.  There are however a limited amount of jobs in hospitals and those are ones that people tend to stay with.

BSN RNs tend to more frequently to want to jump into competitive units (Peds, ED, ICU, NICU, LDRP).

Nursing schools exist often in places where nurses are needed *the least*.  It may be a ""chicken or the egg"" problem here.  The southwest, south and midwest are in significant need for RNs.

Finally, regardless of your view on PPACA it certainly has made hospitals have to reorganize themselves and their care, which explains current hiring lulls.  Additionally in the grand scheme of PPACA it provides  incentives for people spending *less* time in hospitals, moving RNs roles more outside the hospital.

tl;dr - jobs exist in surplus outside of hospitals and in geographic regions not served by nursing schools.",best major to study in college

Most card-based engine builders have a problem where it's hard to see what your opponents are doing. But in TfM, you can see most of what a player is doing by looking at the central board or their production boards. Sometimes you need to look at their tags and their blue cards, but even that is relatively easy to see based on the iconography.",best board games

When you can't do that, try to use a new can of paint at a corner. When you get to a corner, and you know the can won't last for the next whole wall, open a new can. At some point, pour all the partial cans of paint together and start at the next corner.

Save the paint chip, or make a new one on flat cardstock. Tape it to the can lid so it can be matched years from now.
