"There's still a large portion of the world that's illiterate. Here's the part where I politely asked:

>No one’s perfect, so if you found any errors or would like to add enhancements, feel free to shoot me a message. I will be sure to include any enhancements and/or correct any issues.

Also, GraphQL and RESTful applications require HTTP requests.

Here's the link if anyone wants to donate to end illiteracy: [Project Literacy](https://www.projectliteracy.com/get-involved/give-to-literacy-new)"

I love chalkies...
were you able to palm claw the xm1? i currently own the model o and it feels way too narrow and flat for me. i get cramps on my pinky and ring finger if i game for really long. cant seem to palm the mouse as well. i have similar hand sizes 20x10. i am currently considering the model d and roccat kain 120. but your review has got me reconsidering the endgame xm1 even though ive been told that it would be too small for my grip style. i used to forcefully palm a kana which was like a fk2 clone so idk. fingertip clawed an office mouse in my early gaming days as well.

"Hi, I recommend that you take a look at my [gaming laptop recommendation list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/). Given what you're looking for, I'd go with the Eluktronics Mech-15 G3 on that list. It offers excellent battery life + performance."

"Yep, use the `node-fetch` package - it's mentioned in the compatibility section at the end: https://danlevy.net/you-may-not-need-axios/#compatibility

It's no 'worse' than having to install any other 3rd party lib, the bonus, however, is you get symmetry between front-end and back-end code."

"This is a treasure trove, thank you! Saving the post so I can properly trawl through and look things up this weekend."
"Suzanne Robinson. She was my favorite author for a long time. I recommend  [Lady Gallant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/646199.Lady_Gallant?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=1) nearly every time there is a grovel thread, and [Lady Dangerous](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1332493.Lady_Dangerous_The_English_Gunslingers_Duet_1_?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=3) when people are looking for an independent, level-headed heroine. I hesitate to actually recommend my third favorite, [Lady Hellfire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2851469-lady-hellfire?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=5), because although I love it, it has what I consider to be a serious flaw in the story (the Hero has *way* too many kinds of trauma going on)."
