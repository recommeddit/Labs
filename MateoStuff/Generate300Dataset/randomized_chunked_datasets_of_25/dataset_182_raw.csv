Whelp... several of these ideas will be filling out my wife's Christmas this year... the others will do for next year.  You sir...  you... just.... you... *wipes away tear*
Is this like a lint remover? I swear the ones I've had have been super crappy and all my jumpers end up with those little balls of fabric. Any recommendations for a good one?
"Agreed. If you look at the breakdown, it didn‚Äôt make it on many list and the ones it did, it didn‚Äôt rank as highly as I would have expected:

Sam Healey (The Dice Tower) #57

Luke Hector (The Broken Meeple) #47

Josef Sannholm (Boardgames with Niramas) #46

Neilan Naicker (Board Game Barrage) #13

Kellen Allen Laker (Board Game Barrage) #9"
I See You. Great movie on Amazon Prime!
Can you tell me which one?
They sold it not too long ago (summer I believe) and it‚Äôs marked down significantly from retail.
"I don‚Äôt have the student deal, but 3 friends and I pitched in on the family subscription for $15/month. We each pay $3.75/month. Still room left on the plan for 1 more too! 

Edit: guess there‚Äôs room for 2 more!"

"that's why. a 290 is not a strong enough GPU for 1440p without lowering presets to low. My 980Ti cant even run this game at 1080p with all settings maxed. 

Guess its a GPU heavy game. I may try 1440p and turn down AA and such and see what happens"

Ask me tomorrow and the order and list will likely change. I would also add, I refrained from putting books that are parts of an ordered series on the list. The entire Culture series by Ian M. Bank is phenomenal. Each book in the series can be read separately in any order. There are several series that when taken on whole, including the novels, novellas, and compilations are excellent:

* The Revelation Space series by Alastair Reynolds
* The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey
* The Xeelee sequence by Stephen Baxter
* The Nexus trilogy by Ramez Naam"
"> HTTP response that has been parsed to a friendly JS object from the JSON string. 

I don't understand this, and it's tripped me up with axios, and also on a PHP library that does web requests too.

Generally speaking, it's horrible to use the same variable for two different things, and especially for two different types (string vs object).  

> This reduces the number of repetitive tasks that you have to do (manually parse JSON like in Fetch)

But it doesn't... it actually creates a bunch more work.  Now I need to write conditional code for every web request to determine whether `response.data` is a string or an object, and then write even more code to account for dealing with both data types.  You can't rely on an external server always succeeding and returning exactly what you were expecting.

The developer is expecting to either operate on string or an object, so why wouldn't `response.data` just stay consistently as a string, and have a method like `response.dataAsObject()` to return it as an object?  It's not more work for the developer, and it means the library behaves in a consistent way.

Please let me know if I misunderstood something, but this ""it saves work"" point just seems completely the opposite to me.  And it's caused multiple problems for me, and many many others from everything I see online about it."

"Arepas made on the griddle + breakfast sausage & eggs (cooked together; sausage first) served with a side of a homemade 'Caribbean' sauce (tartar sauce & cilantro, blended together until fully green).

That, or a bowl of pho tai chin (Vietnamese beef noodle soup w/ thinly sliced beef eye round steak [raw], and thinly sliced beef brisket [cooked]), tai on-the-side (so it doesn't become overlooked by the broth), with all the fixins (loads of hand-torn basil, a small dollop of chili-garlic sauce, a squeeze of lime, a few squirts of fish sauce, a splash of soy sauce, some sliced jalape√±o, and a drizzle of sesame seed oil).
