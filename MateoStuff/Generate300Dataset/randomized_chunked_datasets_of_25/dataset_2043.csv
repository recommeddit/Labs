My eyes have seen incoherent posts, statistical deception, non-popperian arguments, ungrammatical posts, insane conspiracy theories and logical fallacies. OP's post is coherent and grammatical, yet is orders of magnitude more silly than anything else I have ever read.

47415,"The Grand Canyon is a particularly awesome spot if you do it right. Personally, I think just going there to see it and doing nothing more would be a bit of a waste and there just isn't that much to do in Flagstaff. Honestly, not even great for a day trip if you can do it. 

However, there are TONS of multi-day excursions and camping opportunities that can take you through the Canyon. You really get lost in the incredibly beauty and vastness of the Canyon, great hikes, climbs, waterfalls & streams feeding into the Colorado, the wildlife, stars, its beautiful. I've been several times for short to quite long camping trips. Every time has been just as good as the last and the Canyon is so large that I feel as if I've never had the same experience. Just know your limits, its hot as hell and you have to climb up to get out - so don't get too tired from your journey and get stuck down there from fatigue.",best state to visit in the United States
