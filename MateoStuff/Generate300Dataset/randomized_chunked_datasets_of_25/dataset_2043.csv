32933,best energy drink,Yeah was going to say the same one. Love that it's not carbonated and has a lovely taste. Gutted that it's pretty impossible to get in the uk now.
69861,best major to study in college,What job opportunities are there?
58515,best cologne,"I like Whitechapel on my husband.  It might strike you as unfortunately named, but that's sort of the Black Phoenix thing.

http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wanderlust.html Near the bottom.  It's a musky smell with a bit of citrus."
70884,best movies with a cool twist,"Yes. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream...

And what's the twist?"

A luigi board"
43977,best items under $100,"Every month I spend $100 on myself. Tervis tumblers, Yeti Ramblers and a GSHOCK GD350 With the negative display have been my last 3 purchases."
27192,best board games,Sounds like it's probably a pretty good list then.
58351,best cologne,"Sorry, just cologne isn't gonna cut it, contrary to what the ad tried to sell you."
69856,best major to study in college,"A few of the perks, according to my astrophysics prof:

1. When astronomers get together, they drink.

2. The higher altitude of most observatories means getting drunk is cheaper.

3. The drink helps you forget how little you're getting paid for this."
58094,best cologne,I like Hawthorne wipes too!
37258,best amusement park,"I mean, that's like half of BGW. That's why I think it's weird."
54893,best water filter,Cloudy water is often just the result of trapped air bubbles.
71191,best movies with a cool twist,"Here are two not yet mentioned, both very well written and directed films about con-men:

Ridley Scott's **Matchstick Men**.

And Tony ""Michael Clayton"" Gilroy's **Duplicity**."
45383,best gaming system,"It's the same for me and I'll get the PC version of timed exclusive console games, if the game really interested me to play more (MHW, RDR2, ...) and the port isn't a total disaster (unlike launch Horizon Zero Dawn)."
71856,best movies with a cool twist,"They might've guessed it completely coincidentally but no, Vader wasn't originally going to be Lukes father, it's just a neat coincidence"
13377,best spreadsheet editor,"This is one of the most commercially unaware, common-sense lacking, devoid of perspective opinions I have ever read online, in 20 years of using the internet. My eyes have seen incoherent posts, statistical deception, non-popperian arguments, ungrammatical posts, insane conspiracy theories and logical fallacies. OP's post is coherent and grammatical, yet is orders of magnitude more silly than anything else I have ever read. Perhaps it is BECAUSE he is an above average IQ individual that unironically believes the words he just typed out."
33940,best Pokemon game,Any of the remakes. Go with something modern.
45942,best trick or treating candy,"Perhaps, but isn't it good until you get sick of it?"

29772,best money managing app,"> > Try YNAB free for 34 days

> That's an odd number (actually it's even but you know what I mean)

The internet trains us into such bad habits.  I actually stopped reading your post at ""That's an odd number"" and started typing a joke reply before even reading the next word.  >.<"
65380,best phone service company,I switched to Verizon postpaid from AT&T Prepaid. Deprioritization was pretty severe (sometimes couldn't even send an iMessage) but customer service was quite good. Ended up switching to AT&T postpaid (Unlimited Elite) and it's been very solid.
47415,best state to visit in the United States,"The Grand Canyon is a particularly awesome spot if you do it right. Personally, I think just going there to see it and doing nothing more would be a bit of a waste and there just isn't that much to do in Flagstaff. Honestly, not even great for a day trip if you can do it. 

However, there are TONS of multi-day excursions and camping opportunities that can take you through the Canyon. You really get lost in the incredibly beauty and vastness of the Canyon, great hikes, climbs, waterfalls & streams feeding into the Colorado, the wildlife, stars, its beautiful. I've been several times for short to quite long camping trips. Every time has been just as good as the last and the Canyon is so large that I feel as if I've never had the same experience. Just know your limits, its hot as hell and you have to climb up to get out - so don't get too tired from your journey and get stuck down there from fatigue."
67394,axios alternatives reddit,"I know, but IMO I shouldn’t need to do that. The argument made by developers for why fetch shouldn’t reject on 400+ makes no sense at all to me and because of that annoyance I’m faithful to axios."
58103,best cologne,Third for Armani Code in the brown bottle.
