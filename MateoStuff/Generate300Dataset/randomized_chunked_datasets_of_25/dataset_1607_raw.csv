"Second Pacifica. One of my favorites has been Sugared Amber, I also like Tahitian Gardenia by them. Silver Moon is a hypnotic poison dupe. Kindred Spirits is a really interesting rose + palo santo scent, it reminds me of incense.

I also like Jessica Simpson Vintage Bloom, it's like a delicate lemon cake. Rihanna Reb'l Fleur is a cozy pineapple scent. Adam Levine for her is quite unisex, it's a spicy sandalwood. Britney Spears Private Show is a dulche de leche latte scent.

As far as body mists, I LOVE the ones by Sol De Janeiro. Cheirosa 71 is the best, it's like a warm cookie out of the oven.

Tea Rose is another great cheapie. It's a very strong and realistic rose.

I have a rollerball of Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely You and it's a super nice musky scent. I think you can get it at Kohl's for around $20."
Definitely. Gavaskar over Smith and Dravid over Amla
"Having the spoiler warning before the name of the character in question is what I was thinking, since just knowing that there's something to be spoiled around a specific character will cause most viewers to pay special attention to that character."
"If you have children you will find that both of you just want time to be yourself.  My wife has an active social life and a number of hobbies/interests.  I would much rather relax by myself and work on my car or play some video games.  Once we had the little guy, everything requires careful scheduling and planning.  The little man is awesome and I wouldn't trade him for anything but the spontaneity of life is definitely diminished."
"I literally can eat it every morning. Sometime with salsa. or with pico de gallo, sometimes both. 

Sometimes, just salt and pepper, other times with maple syrup. They're just delicious in so many ways."

"u/LifelongCaboose would you pin this to the main thread as there's a lot of console wireless questions. I realize you're not a fan of these products, but your work in looking at this and educating people is worth pinning to main page."
ah ok thanks! do you by chance have any good guides youve read on this just so I can expand my understanding

I went to Running Room and got a great pair of Saucony for around $125 I think (they were on sale)
"I'm not sure what I expected, but it wasn't that."
"I use hardened Firefox and Tor on the PC, Bromite on my Android. Never saw what people like about Brave and the fact the developer, Brandan Eich  is a homophobic twat. Tried Vivaldi, but I run multiple PC's, laptops etc and want some continuity. But it runs like crap on low end hardware, like one laptop I have. And it can be buggy. 

As for a search engine, I jump around between DDG and Startpage, but mainly DDG."
I’ll pass. And then he waddled away.
"My experience is the exact opposite from yours. I live in EU and logitech support here is dog shit. They make you jump through hoops to RMA a defective unit while Razer simply asks you for the serial number of the product. A lot of people here also complain about GPW scroll wheel and the switches which obviously have a problem. That being said i might have been lucky with my VPU but all my friends also got lucky with their? And all of us got unlucky at least 2 times each with the GPW? 
It's a bit weird if you ask me. To each their own i guess, but imo the VPU is much better than GPW."
I agree with your lineup but I'd shift Kris a little further up
"Saline nasal mist, lots of tea and soup. Cause those drugs cover up the problem and you end up feeling worse when the effects wear off."
I'll Be Gone In The Dark   --    is a recent miniseries on the Golden State Killer.  It's on HBO and it's scary as fuck.
"This is how I feel about Milk of Magnesia.

For those who don't know, Milk of Magnesia is a white, chalky liquid that comes in a blue bottle that you're supposed to drink as a laxative. But if you rub it on your face, it gets rid of your acne. When NOTHING ELSE WILL.

When I was in high school, I had terrible, stubborn acne, and no amount of prescription drugs or proactiv worked. I tried everything and it was so frustrating. Then my mom saw somewhere on line that Milk of Magnesia helps if you rub it on your face.

It worked like a dream. In like two weeks my acne was gone. I would suggest acne-ridden Redditors to try it out.

Sidenote: DO NOT rub the cherry-flavored MOM on your face. The sugar will just make you break out more. PLAIN ONLY."

"To be completely honest, if a country music magazine made a list called ""The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" and included nothing but country I would not care a single bit. They're a country music magazine, of course they're going to think the 500 greatest albums of all time are country."
