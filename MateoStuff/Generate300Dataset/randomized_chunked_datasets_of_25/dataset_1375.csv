47029,best hand santizer brand,"If you actually drank enough Everclear to reach bactericidal concentrations throughout your entire GI tract top to bottom, you’d be dead hours ago.  But then again, you’re Gary Busey."
61301,Best RPG game on PS4,"I know what u mean about the souls borne games and I'd agree to some extent but the only reason I had multiple playthroughs on them were the rpg elements, cosplaying as one of the bosses was very fun for me. Bloodborne being called fashionborn shows a lot too."
71937,best movies with a cool twist,"Expected nothing from the movie and came out of the theatre amazed. 

Doesnt have as much rewatch potential compared to predestination, primer or prestige, but it's still an amazing film."

48368,best color to paint with,White Dove by Benjamin Moore is a very clean and versatile classic.
52143,best iphone case,"I personally use lifeproof frē and love it. It gives me a better grip on the phone since it's flat on the sides and protects the phone from drops, water and snow. It's a bit pricey but better than buying a new phone if you drop it"

30849,best country to live in,"Why is it boring? I spent 3 weeks there. Only went to Amsterdam for an afternoon to visit the Rijksmuseum, but absolutely loved the country. I'm starting the immigration process at the end of the summer and couldn't be more excited. I'm not one for nightlife, partying, that sort of thing. I have a degree in history. And everywhere I went I was absolutely fascinated. I loved just walking through the streets of Utrecht."

3092,best webcamera,"Nah, this ain't the answer, *at all.*

Even in high bandwidth areas people stream from noisy, small sensor shitty laptop webcams that could be from the late 90s, quality wise, with grease on the lens and bad lighting. Higher bandwidth couldn't polish those turds if it tried to.

And you don't even need that much bandwidth for streaming a quality 720p@25fps webcam anyway, it's all h264 compressed at least, it basically takes next to no bandwidth. You can easily fit that into an Mbps or two.

And if you're really starved for bandwidth, a proper high quality 640x360 capture from a quality sensor would still easily beat the shitty noisy, compressed crap most 1080p webcams churn out with its hands tied behind its back.

So no, bandwidth is no excuse for manufacturers still producing GameBoy Camera level webcams in 2021."
