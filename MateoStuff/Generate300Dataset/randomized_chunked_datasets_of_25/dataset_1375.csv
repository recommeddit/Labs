3092,"Nah, this ain't the answer, *at all.*

Even in high bandwidth areas people stream from noisy, small sensor shitty laptop webcams that could be from the late 90s, quality wise, with grease on the lens and bad lighting. Higher bandwidth couldn't polish those turds if it tried to.

And you don't even need that much bandwidth for streaming a quality 720p@25fps webcam anyway, it's all h264 compressed at least, it basically takes next to no bandwidth. You can easily fit that into an Mbps or two.

And if you're really starved for bandwidth, a proper high quality 640x360 capture from a quality sensor would still easily beat the shitty noisy, compressed crap most 1080p webcams churn out with its hands tied behind its back.

So no, bandwidth is no excuse for manufacturers still producing GameBoy Camera level webcams in 2021.",best webcamera
