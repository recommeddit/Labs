I was amazed to see an apparently serious article referring to Nike shoes as running shoes. Nike is style. That's it.

Damn man that blows. I live in Maryland just shy of the Pennsylvania border so I don't think there is a single place that sells alcohol that doesn't stock Yuengling.

"Use Amazon wardrobe or in person at a ray ban dealer (most eyeglass places, Sunglasses hit, etc)."
I'd rather that than it being unbelievably humid all the time.

">Ultron is one of the best villains Marvel has but yet and still in this movie they have turn him into a fucking comedian and not a funny one

Not even true. He quips like, what, 5 times in the movie? Y’all exaggerate how “funny” they made him to an ironically hilarious degree


>Also the pacing in this film is fucking horrible there's is too many sections in this film where the movie just stops in his tracks. Age of Ultron never flows fluently is it jumps around

Super general and non specific so all I can say is I disagree


>Quicksilver one of the first  Avengers in the comics gets killed off before they even get a chance to flesh out his character so there is no meaning to his death because we the audience don't even get to understand the character.

The MCU is not the comics. Quicksilver as a character is owed nothing. He played his role in the story. His death had meaning in that he played a hand in Ultron’s plan so per Hawkeye’s speech to Wanda, instead of holding his grudges or blaming himself he takes a stand and gives his life for something greater


 
>And last but not least Black Widow and the Hulk possibly the worst romance in the MCU. Who would ever thought Black Widow would want to fuck the Hulk

Lmfao of course “Black Widow wouldn’t fuck the Hulk!” is the most thinking you could do on the matter. Their relationship is firmly rooted in the film’s main theme and their characters. You know, the thing that makes stories good? They both come from pasts where their agencies were completely removed resulting in them becoming “monsters”. Their respective ways of coping with that attract them to one another. But knowing that would require engaging with the movie on a meaningful level lol"
"Hard to complain about Lewy when your striker options are Kane, Benzema, and Immobile.  But if we want to be strict about place of birth, we lose Ronaldo too.  The Romans were certainly aware of Madeira but don't seem to have ever established a presence on it.

We can have a front three of Salah-Kane-Mbappe, as well as a midfield with Kante, De Bruyne, Verratti, and basically whoever we want from France/Italy/Spain.  It's definitely far and away the best national team that would ever exist."
