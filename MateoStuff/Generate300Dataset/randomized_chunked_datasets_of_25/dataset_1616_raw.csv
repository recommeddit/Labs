"Lol I mean really though, if you can effectively use XHR I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't.  If it ain't broken don't fix it right?  But then again I only know the basics of XHR requests and I'm not sure if there are any reasons why you would want to not use it.  But then again I'm pretty sure XHR is old enough to drink now."

"That’s kinda why I’m optimistic for WoF’s future. Regional park owned by CF, in a fairly isolated area but in a big city. I think it should be moving in a good direction soon."

"Forza Horizon 3 - More arcadey, fun for collecting and customising tons of cars and doing crazy builds.

Assetto Corsa - Pretty realistic sim but not too full on - Tones of easy to install mods for more cars and tracks which i recommend checking out

rfactor 2 - If you want a really realistic sim to test your driving skills

Project Cars - Not as realistic as Assetto corsa and rfactor but more of a sim racer with more polish and better graphics and a good career more

Dirt Rally - Only realistic Rally game worth owning IMO"
