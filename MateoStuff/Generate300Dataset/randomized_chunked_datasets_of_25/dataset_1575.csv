Drop Sort is an algorithm that will *always* return a sorted list in O(n). 

Drop sort is just start on the second element of the list. If the element is smaller than the previous element, drop it from the list, else move to the next element. Repeat for the entire list. You will always take n-1 operations worst case, the list will always be sorted. It is a lossy algorithm, just like Jpeg.",best major to study in college

While no cats are truly hypoallergenic, Siberians carry far less of the protein in their saliva that you are allergic to.

I also use this computer when rendering out video files (which I really need to do more often), and it is *substantially* faster at this task than the i7-7700k in my main/gaming rig.
