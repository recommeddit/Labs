15822,best sunglasses for fashion,"If you want to go classic aviator style, try the American Optical/Randolph Engineering aviator. They’re the same sunglasses issued to military pilots and astronauts back in the day [as seen here](https://m.imgur.com/UfBc7U1). The only downside (or plus, however you look at it) is that the lenses are made from glass, so they can shatter.

Aside from those, Ray-Ban makes a non-polarized version of nearly all their sunglasses, and plenty of other manufacturers."

63022,Best online React course,"I was searching for good React courses and here are the best courses i found:

1. [https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Maximillian. Currently very cheap.
2. [https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react](https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react) by Mosh. It is 150$ or 15$/m sub (You will also have access to his other [courses](https://programmingwithmosh.com/courses/) for a month if you sub).
3. [https://advancedreact.com/](https://advancedreact.com/) by Wes Bos. It is currently 30$ for me with extra discounts.
4. [https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/) by Tyler Mcginnis. It is 20$/m sub (You will also have access to his other [courses](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/) for a month).

I just bought Maximillian's course because it is like 4$ for me right now. But i am also thinking about subbing to Mosh because of his Javascript/React courses.

Also you can check their youtube videos/free courses to see how they are teaching. I really liked Mosh's teaching style."
3027,best webcamera,I understand people tend to do that but I rather use actual specific terms for hardware that is vastly different between the two. Prevents a lot of confusion especially when the names contradict the actual hardware being described.
12584,best gifts for mom,">  I would call you, but I can't figure out this phone - where's the call button?

This triggers me.  My mother absolutely refuses to learn how to text, says it's too complicated.  I know for a fact she can read and spell, and those are the two primary skills required.  I took a look at her phone when I was visiting for Thanksgiving, and it had 300+ unread texts.  Infuriating."

37375,best amusement park,"I’m personally not into the IP stuff Universal has but I wasn’t impressed when I went 2019.  Yeah the sets are fantastic but it’s a total mobscene even on a Thursday in September and it’s a constant conga line through the houses and the scare actors are just eh for the most part, they were pretty limited to basic jumpscares.  Howl o Scream in Tampa was a lot less crowded and the actors had a lot more freedom to have fun interactions and it was far more enjoyable overall."

41488,best instrument to play,"And the tuba is rarely used as such outside of bad band music. Composition had generally moved past that kind of harmonic simplicity before the tuba was even invented! The tuba holds down the bass on so many incredible brass moments in late Romantic music--Mahler, Strauss, BRUCKNER! You already mentioned Wagner and Stravinsky... The tuba was also treated quite favorably in Russia, just check out the music of Mussorgsky (leaping to France, look at the tuba part to the Ravel's orchestration of Pictures), or of course Shostakovich and Prokofiev in the next century, which I could go on about.

It just makes absolutely no sense to say ""bass lines in classical are awesome,"" and then assume otherwise about an instrument you clearly aren't very familiar with. Why would composers think, ""wow, all these root position tonic-dominant alternations are getting boring, why don't we write interesting and highly chromatic bass lines?"" and then not do the same for the tuba???

Tubas also get great parts in brass quintets. One of the most played brass quintets around starts with a damn [tuba solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XXyrcmOKps)! 

I'll leave you with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-NkYMRUQvs)"
475,best terminal file manager reddit,"I tried it a few bit. Look nice but, we dont have multi tab/pane? I mean I love to navigate a bit from here and there from multi folder, and keep that tab to comeback later. ~~I'm now using tmux to maintain 2 pane for 2 nnn~~ (read README). Is nnn intended to do that way?

Or my workflow is not sufficient? 

copy, move, delete files is took much time compare to finder, but why would we have to do that instead just have a binding to remove the files, like cd xx && rm file?

Sorry if I complain too much, I want to try something different than current finder (Mac). Moving from graphic to cli is touch, just curious why those simple task is not being in consideration.

Edit: I want config NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER for Osx, what should I fill in

Thanks"

22563,best celebrity,"A friend of mine worked Selena Gomez's tour as a sound engineer and also reported she was a sweetheart. When the tour wrapped, she threw the whole staff a party and gave everyone fully loaded ipads (this was maybe 1-2 months after the release of the first ipad mind you), a 100 dollar itunes gift card, and spend the time to talk to everybody 1-on-1 and thank them for their work.

He also worked for Justin Bieber's tour, and JB didn't do anything."
