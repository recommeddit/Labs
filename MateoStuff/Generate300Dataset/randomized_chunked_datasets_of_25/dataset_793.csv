10972,best backpack for college,"Big fan of the Booq Boa Squeeze that was gifted to me. You may enjoy it too if you're looking for something a little off from the traditional backpack shape. Very comfy straps too that have held up beyond my graduation 4 years ago. They have bigger and/or cheaper models as well.

29204,best web hosting service,">what you recommend as top hosting for wordpress web ?

What I love is how you asked this question two times and both people didn't reply to even offer anything else - just blurted out negativity... very telling.  


I used them for 3 years, never had an issue, but my site is small potatoes... so I think this industry is super greasy."
51739,best iphone case,No battery case No upgrade!
6653,best iPhone,"all the iPhones are 6-7, and the highest repair ability ones I did not recognize the brand at all (other than Google, which I know they update their phones for a while iirc).

Not recognizing the brand likely means that they won’t be getting security updates a few years down the line.

iPhones, although slightly less repairable, are the best option software side of things in terms of longevity."
56205,best action and adventure movie,"I couldn't tell you what the ""best"" action movies of all time are, but I can tell you my favorites. Here's my top 15 favorite action flicks at the moment (using a loose definition of ""action flick""):

1. the original Indiana Jones trilogy (1981, 1984, and 1989) - In the 1930s, archaeologist Indiana Jones battles to prevent religious artifacts from falling into evil hands.
2. the original Star Wars trilogy (1977, 1983, and 1980) - Moisture farmer Luke Skywalker gets caught up in the Galactic Civil War after being recruited by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to help him aid Princess Leia, a key leader in the Rebel Alliance battling against the evil Galactic Empire.
3. *Rough Riders* (1997) - Theodore Roosevelt resigns from his government post to become the leader of a group of volunteer American dismounted cavalry fighting in the Cuban campaign of the Spanish-American War.
4. *Commando* (1985) - A former special forces operative comes out of retirement after his daughter is kidnapped by a group of mercenaries.
5. *Metropolis* (1927) - It doesn't really become an action-adventure movie until its last third, but this silent sci-fi epic about tensions between the upper and working classes reaching their breaking point in the city of the future is ace.
6. *The Wind and the Lion* (1975) - Very, very, very, very, very loosely based on a real event, a hostage crisis in 1904 Morocco brings the United States to the brink of war with desert rebels
7. *Dillinger* (1973) - Bank robber John Dillinger and his supergang tear through the American Midwest on a crime spree in the 1930s.
8. *The Magnificent Seven* (1960) - A team of seven gunslingers travel to Mexico to protect a defenseless village there from a gang of bandits.
9. *The Guns of Navarone* (1961) - During World War II, a team of Allied commandos is dispatched to the Greek island of Navarone to sabotage two massive Nazi cannons there.
10. *Death Wish 3* (1985) - Architect-turned-vigilante Paul Kersey wages war on the street gangs of New York City (so-bad-it's-good, obviously).
11. some of the other Star Wars films (2016, 2005, 2018, and 2015) - I don't consider them canon in my ""headcanon,"" but these action-adventures set everybody's favorite far, far away galaxy are still highly, highly entertaining.
12. *Khartoum* (1966) - This one may not count as an action movie, but it's still riveting and has top-drawer action scenes. During the Mahdist War, a British officer is dispatched to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum to evacuate it in the face of a jihadist insurrection. Will he follow orders or dig in?
13. *The Great Escape* (1963) - Like the above film, it may not count as a true action movie, but it still demands a spot on the list. During World War II, Allied prisoners-of-war plot their breakout from the Nazi prison-camp they're being held in.
14. *The Killer* (1989) - A virtuous Hong Kong hitman goes on one last mission to pay for eye surgery for a woman he accidentally blinded.
15. *Duck, You Sucker* (1971) - A Mexican bandit and an Irish revolutionary team up to rob the Mesa Verde bank, but find themselves involved neck-deep in the Mexican Revolution.

Of course, there are other action masterpieces, but these are just personal favorites."
59139,best perfume,"Burberry Brit. 

Everyone loves it. It came out in 2003 so it's not super expensive anymore. 

My best friend sprayed some of mine on before we went out, and her boyfriend liked it so much he bought it for her for Christmas."

56343,best desktop monitor,I think Gigabyte recently announced an oled panel that will be in the 30s inches
56338,best desktop monitor,"When I look at all the monitors I've owned and used when I look back at a damn good monitor I think of the LG 32GK850G. It gad Gsync, good contrast, no overblown colours and solid sRGB out of the box. I really had everything except the PPI at 1440p 32"" felt wrong to me, just lacked the sharpness I'd expect and feel 27"" is really the max, obviously a matter of opinion. I feel myself sitting further back than I used to and if one shows up on eBay, I wouldn't hesitate to grab myself one because it's just a fantastic display.

Most high refresh rate, good performing gaming monitors are IPS apart from the 32"" LG and G7. IPS monitors for the most part have the spec I look for in a monitor but I see IPS displays as lacking basic picture quality fundamentals, don't get me wrong no LCD is perfect but VA monitors are able to produce the deep black and solid overall picture that IPS can't touch.

 I currently own the AW2721D and it has good out of the box gamma curves, some of the best I've seen, and while the red point is toned down and it's tastefully tuned, it's still inaccurate for the most part and offers very little dynamic range and colour depth in SDR. When I think about it, it's pretty much half a monitor to me because it just cannot produce SDR content as intended because it's lacking in dark range. I'm torn because it also has great gradient handling, colour blend is essentially perfect leading to excellent colour distinction, the light antiglare coating also ideal.

Some great elements to this display but it's still not a great display overall. IPS panels will always have these limitations for SDR content and it's starting to mirror how their TV's are. IPS TV's are failing and have been for years. It took year for companies to start using good VA panels and now that they've come to monitors it's starting to make IPS seem like a bad choice for anyone who wants great picture quality. The G7 and G9 and the evolution of those displays will make it difficult for IPS overall especially when wide viewing film comes to monitors which is really IPS only strength over VA. 

I can see the flat G7's being pretty much the go to monitor assuming QC is tight."
