55571,"I think you're reading too much into what I wrote. First of all, lets clear one thing up right off the bat. I'm not making an argument. I'm sharing my opinion.

Second, I'm NOT suggesting that HP isn't good because it's children's lit. There is plenty of really great children's lit out there, which I readily acknowledge. 

>  though the bit where HP got popular because it was popular is pretty ludicrous circular logic.

It isn't logic, it's an observation. As far as I can tell, the Kardashian's got their popularity in the same way. ""Famous for being famous"" is an expression you must be familiar with, no? IMO, the phrase describes HP as well.

And look - I never even said it was bad. I found them to be entertaining at times - but *personally* there are too many flaws (what I consider to be flaws) with the writing to consider them really good. 

You want specifics? Here's three of the top of my head:
1) Extremely flat characters. Characters are either good or evil. The bad characters are cartoonishly evil.  
2) Very poor character development in most cases. Example - Who are Malfoy's henchmen? Crabbe and who? How do you tell them apart? They're just names. There's no character there at all.  
3) Deus ex machina everywhere. This is the worst aspect of the books to me.   

Final word: it seems like you're trying very hard to defend HP from attacks I haven't even made. I never said it was terrible. I never said you shouldn't read it. I DID say (I'm paraphrasing myself here) ""It's fairly mediocre, I'm not sure why it's so popular.""  That's not an argument. It's just my opinion.

And lastly - just a reminder that I'm only in the 4th book. I've told they get better towards the end, and I'm plugging away hoping that's true. I may revise my opinions once I finish the series. We'll see. My opinions therefore should only be considered to apply to the first three books.",best action and adventure novel series

41563,"Not just that but someone else also mentioned the skill ceiling. The expectations for what is “good” also keeps rising. If you look at competition winners and pros from the 70s and 80s vs now there’s a huge leap in expectations and skill level. It can be said for almost any instrument but because of the high competition/over saturation of the field it pushes the envelope of expectations of what is “good” at an extremely fast rate. They are expected to practice longer than some other instruments because the physical aspect of playing piano allows them to play their instruments for longer than brass, woodwinds, and stringed instruments. On top of that, because many people are able to start piano when they are younger there are higher expectations about what they should be able to do at a younger age. So not really an employment difficulty, because of the over saturation but a change of perception of what is considered “good” in the field because of the high competition.",best instrument to play

23101,"I used to work at Disney World and encountered many celebrities. I won't bore you with the whole list, but the notable ones:

Snoop Dogg: Really nice to the guys, completely ignored the women. We were all gathered at the exit of the ride in between seating new people, and he went down the line and shook hands with/chatted to all of my male coworkers and didn't even spare any of us girls as a glance.

Mariah Carey: Total divamonster. Firstly, she demanded that we not just hold the line out of sight while she and her party had a private go on the ride, she demanded that we completely cycle out both ride machines and the line, which took over an hour since I worked at a very busy attraction. Then when the kids in the party couldn't ride because they were too short, she threw a tantrum (""Do you know who I am??!!"") as if it was a judgement call we were making, not literally a safety standard set by OSHA.

Justin Bieber: Surprisingly not that bad, given that he was at the height of his public assholery. He was with a group of like 20 people around his age, and they were no worse than the usual frat groups/bachelor parties we handled.

Paul McCartney: Super low-key guy. He didn't even ask to go on the ride privately, just asked to be brought on the ride after the other passengers were already in their seats and had a row just for his group.

Steven Tyler: By far my favorite celebrity encounter. I happened to be in the break room and he came in to use our bathroom- there was an audible gasp from all of us on break and we just openly gawked at him, and he just smiled and said ""what's up"". Like ten seconds later, one of my coworkers came out of the bathroom looking totally shellshocked and said ""um... I just peed next to Steven Tyler.""

And then I was off break when Steven Tyler actually went on the ride, so I got to assist with that. His party was really friendly and jokey, and they were good-naturedly teasing us for getting starstruck. One of my coworkers was nervously starting every sentence to anyone in his earshot with ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"", and Steven Tyler started yelling over at her ""Hey, Sorry! Hey, have you ever played the board game SORRY? I think you'd really like it!""",best celebrity
