55015,"New Hampshire mountains are one of the snowiest, windiest, and coldest mountain ranges in Northern America where various jet winds meet in winter and dump ton of snow. They are deadly. Pretty much from northern New York to Maine, it is really cold in winter. Pennsylvania mountains and ridges are not that high, so really the next interesting mountains are stretching from WV down to Smokies. Since the tallest mountains east of Mississippi are out there, it is cold and not that hikeable   due snow. I was from western NC to SW VA to WV in winters and it always snowed or had flurries. Some areas do not get enough snow to ski, but sleet is very common in that region. We usually go ski up north to Poconos or Adirondacks due a better snow pack.",best places to hike in the east coast

38449,"I always read a physical paper when I ride the bus or sit around in a coffee shop or waiting in a doctor's office or whatever. At home or work I always read the Internets.

Here in Vancouver there are a lot of free papers that you can get on the bus or in coffee shops. I think it's a shame because in these rare moments where people are receptive to reading something outside of their normal sphere it is wasted on reading low quality free papers littered with ads.

A while ago I thought it would be cool if you could easily take good blog content from the Internet, turn it into a paper and then distribute these papers around your neighbourhood or school. It would be a great way to spread alternative media and messages to people when they are receptive to reading them.
