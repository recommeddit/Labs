55015,best places to hike in the east coast,"New Hampshire mountains are one of the snowiest, windiest, and coldest mountain ranges in Northern America where various jet winds meet in winter and dump ton of snow. They are deadly. Pretty much from northern New York to Maine, it is really cold in winter. Pennsylvania mountains and ridges are not that high, so really the next interesting mountains are stretching from WV down to Smokies. Since the tallest mountains east of Mississippi are out there, it is cold and not that hikeable   due snow. I was from western NC to SW VA to WV in winters and it always snowed or had flurries. Some areas do not get enough snow to ski, but sleet is very common in that region. We usually go ski up north to Poconos or Adirondacks due a better snow pack."

64528,Best Nike running shoes,">Once that is clear, there will be shoes able to accommodate all kind of over-pronation issues in each of the categories.

So you didn't really talk about which specific shoe does what within each category. How do you figure out that part of it?"
60640,Best comedy show on Netflix,"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It's a netflix original, and in my opinion the wacky humor is perfect and never fails to crack me up."
51437,best iphone case,You may want to get a better quality clear case. iPhone 12 clear case quality was abysmal
20115,best workout music,What?!
49116,best gaming monitor,I have the Dell 2716 and love it
55650,best action and adventure novel series,"Heinlein's *The Puppet Masters* is possibly the fastest paces sf book I have read, it's very much underrated among his books I think.    
 (Also ripped off by the *Falling Skies* tv show)"
38449,best newspapers to read,"I always read a physical paper when I ride the bus or sit around in a coffee shop or waiting in a doctor's office or whatever. At home or work I always read the Internets.

Here in Vancouver there are a lot of free papers that you can get on the bus or in coffee shops. I think it's a shame because in these rare moments where people are receptive to reading something outside of their normal sphere it is wasted on reading low quality free papers littered with ads.

A while ago I thought it would be cool if you could easily take good blog content from the Internet, turn it into a paper and then distribute these papers around your neighbourhood or school. It would be a great way to spread alternative media and messages to people when they are receptive to reading them.

21581,best winnie the pooh comic,"I read it as two friends, one giving the other one shit."
69250,best major to study in college,Interesting.  That's about what I thought.  I'm a subcontractor in fire protection and can attest to the bullshit and change orders that happen down the line because of an incomplete design.  I swear dealing with that and arguing about it is half my job.  I also happen to be friends with several architects that want to break out of corporate to do it on their own.

2970,best webcamera,The issue is likely how they're recording the call. If they've still got analog lines or recorders it had a limited range of sound. Can compress it to hell too.
