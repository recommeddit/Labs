30473,best Mexican war to study,"Polish – Soviet War 

I think Reddit will like this one too. I took place right after the WW I. It has been only one year since Poland regained it's independence and it had to defend against newly formed and bloodthirsty Red Army. Polish army was poorly equipped in compression to it's opponent. So we used our brains! A team of brilliant mathematicians managed to intercept and decrypt Soviet transmissions even faster then Soviets themselves. So we knew their every move and we won. 

Some historians say that if it weren't for us the Red Army would stop somewhere around France. Here are some links

64149,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"I've had similar problems finding Romanian ebooks - you might have some luck by searching for common book names and file extensions (in Dutch), and finding a website that happens to have loads.

17606,best iOS game,"Here’s the ones that have stayed and gotten played regularly on my phone:

- Mafia Mystery: text based multiplayer game like Town of Salem or Werewolves
- Alchemia Story: MMO JRPG with awesome customization and enough grind to keep you satisfied + multi class on one character 
- Golf Blitz: Multiplayer golf where you can hit other players balls outta the way, some fun avatars and maps all free
- Call of Duty Mobile: Just IMO the most polished shooter so far. PUBG works too if you prefer battle royale 
- Draw Classic: I play back and forth with my fiancé and it’s just cute to send drawings over

I hear Polytopia is good, but it also requires you to buy something in order to unlock multiplayer. SuperFowlst 2 is downloaded and nice if you like arcade type games."

24954,best spiderman actor,"Andrew gave a good performace, he was just in bad movies. He was a good Spider-Man in bad Spider-Man films. I think people fail to understand that."
49040,best gaming monitor,"I just picked up this monitor and it is by far the best monitor I have ever used. Excellent colors, decent brightness, quality IPS panel. HDR is alright, but makes things look really yellow and lacks the ability to locally dim the panel; on the HDR videos I watched on YouTube using the HDR setting the brights were way oversaturated.

I do like HDRi, which emulated HDR for regular content. I tend to play single player games, and the visual pop the setting gives most games is great."
