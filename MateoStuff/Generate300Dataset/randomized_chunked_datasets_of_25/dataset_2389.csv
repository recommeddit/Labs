51098,"the people bitching at this list have to realize that this is mostly compiled of NME's taste and not very much general consensus is relied upon here. a more acceptable list to criticize would be rolling stone's best of's, as they assemble a huge panel of different judges and still manage to have the most generic taste in a list possible. personally, i think pitchfork's best of lists are probably the least egregious, as it's very easy to see their list as their own and not just a stale, played out top 50 or 100 with the same five beatles or zeppelin albums.

24578,"1) Higurashi - My favorite anime psychological thriller. I loved the unique take on story telling. 

2)Death Note (till episode 26 I think)- L 

3) Mirai Niki - another really nice psychological thriller with some great wtf mind blown moments . 

4) Steins Gate - really nice narrative, a bit slow at first but it helps develop the characters which comes in handy when everything goes to shit.

5) Madoka Magika  - The series was really good but what really got me to love the series is the ever so controversial movie . 

6) Shinsekai Yori - Another unique psychological thriller set in a dystopic future . Loved the portrayal of the world and how society had evolved.

7) Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso - made me cry for the only other time besides when I watched violet evergarden episode 10. 

8) If I was to include a manga which will eventually be adapted into the 3rd and 4th season of it's anime then Nanatsu No Taizai - Escanor is my favorite anime/manga character of all time so there is no way I would miss out on mentioning him.",best anime

Chilewich - for placemats but also for custom-sized flooring that works great in an office (your chair wheels roll right over the flooring). 

Brooklinen and Snowe for bedding/towels. Can vouch for Snowe: very nice bedding for what you pay for. The Company Store is good as well. Snowe also has starter kits for dishes and glassware but haven't tried them out. They look nice though.

Casper and similar for mattresses. 

Online design services like Havenly (there's others, can't remember their names; have had good experience with Havenly). 

JC Penny for window treatments -- they will help you select, measure, install and all of that. (But Home Depot is best for cellular shades, though I know you said you aren't including them). 

AJ Madison for appliance reviews, specs, pricing. We ended up purchasing local for the service agreements, but this was a great resource for research.

I have a love-hate relationship with West Elm. If you like MCM and are looking for apartment-sized furniture, they can be a pretty good choice, but I'd want to test the furniture out in person.
