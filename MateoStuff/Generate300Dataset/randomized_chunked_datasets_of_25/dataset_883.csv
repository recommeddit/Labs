65659,best phone service company,So ATT and Teltik both have truly unlimited data? But Teltik is $5 cheaper. Now I am not sure how easy to would be to fool Teltik as it Att on the hotspot side of things. I know a jailbreak would work
70092,best major to study in college,"Not to take anything away from you for choosing that path, but I know a few people who said the same thing, and are regretting it now. Try to find a balance between doing what you enjoy and being at least a little bit hireable, and future-you will be thankful."

I have 6 chargers, only one is the USB-C that came with my phone."
26109,best politician,"Also a shrewd Commander in Chief--making the decision to drop the bomb on Japan but ignoring pressure from his top generals to drop the bomb on China.

Furthermore, he stood up for what he believed in the face of overwhelming opposition. He vetoed Taft-Hartley which was so popular among Congress that they overrode his veto. He also desegregated the armed forces way before the height of the civil rights movement. Truly an underappreciated leader."

42609,best detective show,Wind River!? Was Sofa King good.
57657,best cologne,"I will add a +1 for YSL La Nuit De L'homme which I wear for dates or more serious events in colder temperatures. 

I personally prefer a lighter and a more fruity scent for warmer temperatures and my go to is Bvlgari Pour L'homme and Voyage by Nautica

Other more options I've tried and liked (and gotten compliments for) include: Dior Homme Intense, A&F Fierce, Jo Malone London Wood Sage and Sea Salt (this is very strong stuff but great for the cooler temps), Versace Eros (probably too citrus-y for your taste)

But ultimately trying samples at a sephora or department store is a great way to try out different smells. But be careful! Trying too many at once will convolute the scent!"
67115,best places to skydive in california,"Elsinore 100%. People love Perris because it's a huge drop zone, but that doesn't mean that as a student youll be accepted by other jumpers. Bottom line, from what I've heard there are alot of dicks who only care about jump numbers. Elsinore has a super open family vibe, and not to mention the incredible instructors, coaches, and administration"

48989,best gaming monitor,"> VG27AQ

How much did you get it for? Thanks!"
40803,best instrument to play,"For a beginner, I always suggest either a piano or an acoustic guitar. Both instruments are fairly easy to learn the basics and can play multiple octaves and chords. Not all instruments can do this so learning music is limited. 
An acoustic guitar or a cheap keyboard can both be inexpensive too. Guitar is probably slightly more portable but piano, in my opinion, is easier to begin."
