Funny that we think of a bronze medal as being pretty good in Olympic events, but somehow you are shit if you don't win the World Cup.

I think Belgium did about as well as they could've. I suppose on paper they had the weapons to win a big one with KdB, Lukaku, Hazard, etc, but on the international scene you are just going to run into those huge nations like Spain, Brazil, Germany, and France who have the same infrastructure for development and a much bigger population. It's not impossible (see: Greece, Portugal), but the margin for error is razor thin.

I think Belgium can be proud of what they achieved."
