22458,"Tom Hanks, absolutely nice. I met him when I worked at in n out burger a few years back. I took an order to his table & was startled when I saw him & I asked “Are you Tom Hanks.” & he looks up from his meal, gives the biggest friendliest smile & says “you betcha.”

When I’m clocking out & leaving he’s heading out exactly as I am so I hold the door open for him, & he greets me with a Thank you. & as he & his son are walking away I say “Mr. Hanks if it’s not any trouble could I possibly take a picture with you?” He turns around with another big grin & says “walk with me kid.” So we talked for about 10 minutes, he asked me about my life, told him all of my favorite movies he is in. He gave me some life advice & his son (very nice but just quiet) took some pictures of us. He gave me a handshake followed by a hug saying it was nice to meet me. I said “I’m glad the most famous person I got to meet was you.” Then they left.

Needless to say my co-workers stared through the windows the entire time & then hounded me for a week about it.",best celebrity

12437,"I think it was 2009 build a bear came out with a moose. My mother likes mooses for some reason.  I unfortunately can't remember why that Christmas my brother and I called our mother Margaret. She couldn't stop laughing at that for some reason. So I have enough money I go to build a bear. Get her the moose, you know I dress the thing in a miss Santa's dress. Now up comes the heart noise button thing. I like humor in my gifts, I'm not going for merry Christmas, no I'm going straight to the dinosaur roar. Yes the store employee asked if I wanted to do the whole give the bear a heart gift,  I fucking did it.  Now comes the name the damn thing, as the post said my mom laughed at my brother and I calling her Margaret I felt that would be the most suitable name. Thus born Roaring Margaret the Moose a Christmas gift.  My mom still has it out and ready to push to make the damn thing roar, and also has put it out as a decoration. I'm 34 now I gave that to her around the time I was 26-27 if I remember right I can't top that gift.
