65647,"I recently changed and looked at Comcast.  From my understanding, you can only use an iphone if you want to BYOD.  It looks like you can still activate on a Samsung device, but only if you buy it from them.  Did I understand that right?

I probably would have given their service a shot, but I've got a Pixel 3 and didn't think they'd let me activate new service with only that device.",best phone service company

He's a regular guy with a profound success story.  He cares more about his family than the artistry of cinema, thus the cheesy Disney movies.  I think we can all relate.",best celebrity

4847,"it's kind of like target vs. walmart (I defer to target a lot but I visit *both*.. I like walmart's saving catcher)

walmart/home depot is always the cheapest.. (sort of) but regardless of higher prices.. lowes there's some hidden values to lowes that I Don't care to elaborate on.. (I'd love to tell you about all the free/hidden value I got from lowes but I can't.. ""information is power"" n' all that that and also because of this.. I've gotten some bad customer service on a few occasions.. but you take the good with the bad..cause it's **90%** *good*) it'd be nice if any store would have these ""new app"" controlled motorized blinds that are supposed to be available but there not yet.

menards is pretty neat.. they just opened 3-4 stores here..but they're all still too far away...

Also when it comes to nearest home depot or lowes.. basically lowes is closer and faster to me to get too.. they are on the highway.. and HD is farther or in the middle of the inner city meaning ""no highway"" access..",best home improvement store

34553,"I'm not saying he's the GOAT, but he's undeniably one of the greatest American athletes of all time. He was in the very first class of pro football Hall of Famers. 

There's a good reason he was ranked 37th on the first list. 

Yes, he played at a time when football was very different. So did Jim Brown, so did Red Grange, so did Otto Graham. 

In a list of all-time greats, you need to compare players to their contemporaries, otherwise you just end up with the top 100 players from the last 20 years. The game is constantly evolving, so the only metric we have to compare is how they compared to their peers, and Jim Thorpe was arguably the sport's most important player when the sport was in its infancy.",best NFL player
