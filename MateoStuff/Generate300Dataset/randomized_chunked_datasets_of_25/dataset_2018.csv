70241,best major to study in college,"Pursue your dream. But look up interviews on the writing process, most importantly how people get published"
65647,best phone service company,"I recently changed and looked at Comcast.  From my understanding, you can only use an iphone if you want to BYOD.  It looks like you can still activate on a Samsung device, but only if you buy it from them.  Did I understand that right?

I probably would have given their service a shot, but I've got a Pixel 3 and didn't think they'd let me activate new service with only that device."
22136,best celebrity,"He was interviewed by Men's Journal a few years back ([best link I could find](http://saguzfantasy.blogspot.com/2008/05/dwayne-johnson-in-mens-journal-june.html)) and it completely changed my [unfounded] negative perception of him.  He's a regular guy with a profound success story.  He cares more about his family than the artistry of cinema, thus the cheesy Disney movies.  I think we can all relate."
59026,best perfume,"Pretty new to the fragrance game, but here it goes (in no particular order):

Replica Jazz Club

Le Male

Dior Homme Cologne

La Nuit de L'homme

D&G the one EDP

Spicebomb Extreme

PDM Layton

MontBlanc Explorer

Well I guess I only have 8 that I consider ""top""."
56255,best action and adventure movie,"Curse of the Black Pearl is really well done, very fun, and hugely entertaining, but on its own I think it's an above average to great movie; it's the sequels that I think skew fondness for it in hindsight, which isn't to say I agree as I think Dead Man's Chest is the best of that franchise."
10778,best suitcase lock,"For work I use zip ties to seal Pelican cases of electronics.  I include extra zip ties in the case so TSA can possibly replace them after they cut them to search the case.  Believe it or not, TSA seems to replace them about half the time."
3041,best webcamera,"I wish there was a mount that had telescopic arm for y axis and rotate, tilt, with the base going to a plate with vesa holes so it could be screwed into your monitor's vesa holes seemlessly"
35649,best alcoholic drink,Pickle Backs! SO GOOD.
32599,best vacation resort,"I also vote St. Lucia. A friend of mine just got back from Jade Mountain- an INCREDIBLE place but pretty damn expensive. If you have the money though, totally worth it, just look at it, it is insane. http://www.oyster.com/st-lucia/hotels/jade-mountain-resort/"

29936,best money managing app,"You can pay by the year, but it's the same price. Also if you're a student or know a student that would be willing to let you use their name/email to signup you can get a free year."
73850,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I’m going with tempered glass, but I’m a dropper so I value protection over writing comfort."
36674,best alcoholic drink,Long Island Ice Teas are good when they aren't from a mix. Japanese beers and whiskeys are good because they are often pretty sweet and don't have as much of that bitter alcohol taste.
14966,best romantic novel,"Anything by Jennifer Crusie if you like contemporary romances. They're funny and sweet, and the heroines are amazing!"
21148,best workout music,That's a great idea.
49083,best gaming monitor,"If you want to play fps / competitive games and you have a pretty powerful gpu then i would recommend the Hp omen x 27 (1440p, 240hz, 1ms, 27"", TN) or there is the eve spectrums. They aren't out yet but planned for 2020 Q4 release. They have a 1440p 144hz IPS 27"" 1ms for $400 or a version with 240hz for $550."
59113,best perfume,"Indigo from Nest has gotten me tons of compliments! It's such a complex and intoxicating scent. Fuck it, I'd recommend anything by Nest."
4847,best home improvement store,"it's kind of like target vs. walmart (I defer to target a lot but I visit *both*.. I like walmart's saving catcher)

walmart/home depot is always the cheapest.. (sort of) but regardless of higher prices.. lowes there's some hidden values to lowes that I Don't care to elaborate on.. (I'd love to tell you about all the free/hidden value I got from lowes but I can't.. ""information is power"" n' all that that and also because of this.. I've gotten some bad customer service on a few occasions.. but you take the good with the bad..cause it's **90%** *good*) it'd be nice if any store would have these ""new app"" controlled motorized blinds that are supposed to be available but there not yet.

menards is pretty neat.. they just opened 3-4 stores here..but they're all still too far away...

Also when it comes to nearest home depot or lowes.. basically lowes is closer and faster to me to get too.. they are on the highway.. and HD is farther or in the middle of the inner city meaning ""no highway"" access.."

Wu-Tang Clan - Wu Tang Forever

4048,best online college,"I did Designlab’s UX design course, with an art history BA under my belt, and went from making 40k in a career with a low ceiling to 70k with a high ceiling for salary. Took me 1 year from beginning to getting hired."
36206,best alcoholic drink,"My wife's favorite joke: A grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says, ""Hey! We have a drink named after you!"" And the grasshopper says, ""You have a drink named Stan?"""
34553,best NFL player,"I'm not saying he's the GOAT, but he's undeniably one of the greatest American athletes of all time. He was in the very first class of pro football Hall of Famers. 

There's a good reason he was ranked 37th on the first list. 

Yes, he played at a time when football was very different. So did Jim Brown, so did Red Grange, so did Otto Graham. 

In a list of all-time greats, you need to compare players to their contemporaries, otherwise you just end up with the top 100 players from the last 20 years. The game is constantly evolving, so the only metric we have to compare is how they compared to their peers, and Jim Thorpe was arguably the sport's most important player when the sport was in its infancy."
60461,Best comedy show on Netflix,"This one was weird for me. I liked in the beginning but lost interest after the plot change, so stopped watching. Does it get better later on?"
