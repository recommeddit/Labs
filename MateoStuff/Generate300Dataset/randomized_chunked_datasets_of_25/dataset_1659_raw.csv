I think I can easily keep the phone for 2-3 more years."

Sounds like we may have different interests... also I am biased because I have been raised in Northern California. But I cannot recommend Yosemite National Park highly enough. I also love the greater Lake Tahoe area. Everyone always thinks of palm trees and white sand beaches when they talk about California- but it is so much more than that.
