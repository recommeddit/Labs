32879,best free online grammar checker,"As Obi Wan once said to Luke Skywalker: ""Just rawdog it bro"". If it feels right then I'm going to assume that it's either grammatically correct, so close to right that nobody except a 19th century schoolmaster is going to notice, or an acceptable stylistic departure."
8622,best toothpaste,I personally think this was the best answer on this entire thread.
47964,best color to paint with,"I like cabernet red matte paint. 

I redid my living room with this & love it for low light areas.

I offset the rest with a matte warm beige paint. 

It's really about what colors speaks to you IMO. I repainted my house 4 times until I found the right pallet that suited my moods."
15065,best romantic novel,"Well if you want to combine literature with romance, Pride and Prejudice is one of the earliest romance novels, and it's considered great literature.  It's got all the classic tropes...the high spirited female heroine with a bit of a temper, the initially stand-offish hero who can't help falling for her, lots of misunderstandings and interfering outsiders, etc.   You've probably already read it, but if not, it's a very enjoyable book!"

15000,best romantic novel,"Laurel K. Hamilton's books about Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter.  If you like vampires and werewolves, or you're not against them but you like murder mysteries, and you like a bit of smut...  you will enjoy these.

Yes, it can get a bit formulaic eventually.  But overall, these books are a fun, sexy read with really interesting plot lines and a strong female lead.  There's a whole ton of them, too.  Enjoy!"
62507,Best RPG game on PS4,For the King is a fun little (co-op) RPG that is suprisingly deep.

53652,best medicine for a cold,"DM is not more effective than placebo for cough suppression (it was approved before testing against placebo was required). 

Expectorants might be giving you false relief. Recent studies seem to indicate that they just make you produce more mucous. You feel like you're getting rid of the stuff but you're producing that much more so you don't actually have any less."
73729,best matte screen protector for ipad,Weird. Do you not draw on paper much?
32700,best vacation resort,"I'm looking for ""vacation""."
6963,best iPhone,"The whole battery thing on the older devices, if I’m correct they crippled the iPhone 7 too and only offered cheap replacements when they were caught. I’m not buying the official statement on that.

I’m talking about the 7, not 7 Plus. It basically only had a new Taptic Engine. Everything else was just same old (and of course a new A-chip but that happens yearly)."
64381,best place to pirate mac apps reddit,"Yes, they are good to go."
73368,best battery bank,"Yeah I get all that, it’s especially useful on a 26 hour flight with no outlets but the weight becomes a bother. It’s just big and heavy enough to cause discomfort in my sling bag. I think a 10k is a good median. Also if you upgrade I recommend staying with USB C"

491,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"Hi, I saw this post while googling for annotating pdfs with a Wacom Intuos S. My aim is the same as yours, making notes while reading papers and some scribbling with formulas/ideas. Did you eventually manage to make it work with a pdf viewer?"
43743,best items under $100,Aw that's so sweet
62456,Best RPG game on PS4,"Diablo 3 is shit. It's not an rpg, it's a hack and slash. If you want character, story, immersion then Witcher, Skyrim, fallout etc do a great job. D3 is just wave after wave of bad guys with weak plot points to send you somewhere else. 

The first Diablo was great, it's been downhill since for the franchise."
