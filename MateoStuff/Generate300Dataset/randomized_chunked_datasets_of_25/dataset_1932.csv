63210,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Package managers are just a graphical front end to APT, which is used to install packages to your device.

There is nothing wrong with having more than one on your device, they all do basically the same thing just with some being more or less buggy and having some other features. 

I personally use cydia, just because what i've had for years and don't have any reason to change it. I have zebra installed and use it occasionally though. It's all personal preference."
25774,best cricket teams of all time,"I believe herschelle is still wanted in India to go on trial. Hansie stated that he was approached and agreed to do it but did not follow through in the end. In my mind that means he did not fix anything but maybe the court would have disagreed.

60286,best freezer brand,"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but two things:

1. Pretty much all chest freezers are made in the same factory in china by another company for each manufacture to brand. So blaming Frigidaire might not be valid, except for the way they handled it under warranty. 

2. All freezers are backordered - big time. There was a massive run on them a few weeks back and the inventory has gone to zero. Best place to find one is Facebook marketplace or craigslist as used. 

The best one to buy in upright is going to be a manual defrost one because there is less to fail. Requires maintenance defrosting but a frost free freezer has a whole defrost system that can fail and ruin your food."

63990,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,i guess direct download is not free while the torrent is
13641,best research paper archive,"More that the authors give away the rights for free ;)

In part, this is because the publisher handles the actual publishing (printing, mostly).

In part, this is because to have a succesful career as a scientist, you need to publish in prestigeous journals. But these journals only publish you if you sign away your rights."
