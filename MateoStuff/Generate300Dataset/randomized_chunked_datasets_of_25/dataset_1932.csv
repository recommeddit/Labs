2. All freezers are backordered - big time. There was a massive run on them a few weeks back and the inventory has gone to zero. Best place to find one is Facebook marketplace or craigslist as used. 

The best one to buy in upright is going to be a manual defrost one because there is less to fail. Requires maintenance defrosting but a frost free freezer has a whole defrost system that can fail and ruin your food.",best freezer brand
