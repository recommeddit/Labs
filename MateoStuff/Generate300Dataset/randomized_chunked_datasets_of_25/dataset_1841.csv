62916,Best Data Science textbook,"I second the recommendation of ""R for Data Science"". You'll be making beautiful visualizations in no time. It's also great in that it doesn't pretend everything is peaches n' cream when it comes to data. You'll learn how to effectively clean and transform your data for analysis.  Really, really great book."

52368,best hiphop album,"You can't just give more props to a group because they've been around longer. Also, even if you disagree that TPAB and GKMC are top 10 rap albums oat, kendrick will still have a legacy left behind because TPAB and GKMC are two of the most critically acclaimed rap albums of the 2010s"
42503,best detective show,"Definitely would have been a different energy but Gandolfini would have made it his own. If you haven't seen it, watch Enough Said with Gandolfini and Julia Louis Dreyfus. It's a romantic dramedy about middle-aged divorcees and shows that Gandolfini is more than Tony Soprano and it's a nice movie."
38503,best newspapers to read,"I think it's better if everybody switches to e-papers. We save paper/trees, information is a click away, it's easier to read, and we have access to the LATEST updates. As much as I love newspapers(they were a big part of my early years), I must accept that electronic mediums are more feasible. Nothing like reading the news off my PDA on the way to work."

22630,best celebrity,"I knew that Cruise was a good guy when some spectator threw water at him at a red carpet event a few years ago. Cruise turned around and said something along the lines of ""Why did you throw water on me?! What did I do to you?! You're a jerk! Do you get that?! How would you feel if someone just threw water on you?! You, sir, are a jerk!""

Something about the way he was calling out an actual jerk made me realize that he was not part of that group."

69885,best major to study in college,"software dev here. When people say they want to become a game developer, what they really mean is they want to become a hobby game developer - have the means to make your ideas reality without any of the crunch times, deadlines, mountain of bugs, etc... as long as you don't care about making a single cent off your game."

26131,best politician,"This is my choice too which is an odd one considering that most of us can't name anything noteworthy he did and he was really soft-spoken, not a fiery orator. He just radiated a trustworthiness that's rare in politicians. A sort of Pope Francis aura. Of course there was the sympathy over his brother's assassination and he captured the ""hope and change"" sentiment of the times without any of the disappointment that could have followed."

10189,best pencil for drawing,"A few things I would recommend is a trusty pencil, a pen, and eraser and marker combination.  You obviously don't need all of these things, but it is a good basic set that will allow you a relatively wide range of choices.  

If your mechanical pencil works well for you, add that to your bag.  For a good drawing pencil set, I recommend something like a Staedtler pencil set. I personally use this [12 pencil tin](http://www.staedtler.ca/Mars_Lumograph_na.Staedtler#ctl08_Tab-product-tab-2) - but because I favour ink over pencil, I don't use it very often.  However, when I am working specifically with graphite or some project, I will default to that set.  

For me, a Pentel mechanical pencil with .5 mm leads, .5 mm Pilot Precise pens, some Sharpies and a Staedtler Mars plastic eraser are my basics.  I stick with these brands because I grew up using them, so I am very familiar with them and thus how to work them to my advantage.  In addition, I would recommend them because the product quality has been consistent and good over the years.  The pencil I use, in fact, was discontinued nearly a decade ago.  However, these pens and pencils happen to fit with my drawing /writing style, so obviously you might want to try different things, but these have all worked very well for me in a variety of situations.

I have a plethora of sketchbooks and notebooks, because I tend to compulsively draw or sketch.  I mostly use pen and ink, drawing not only in the sketchbooks but also napkins, stray bits of paper, coffee cups, and whatever is around me.  That's where the Sharpies come in handy - an ultra-fine black sharpie is what I often use.  I always carry a small sketchpad with me just so I can jot down ideas that I think I might want to elaborate upon later or want consistent /better paper quality.

My absolute basics would be some sort of notepad or sketchpad (anything with binding that night be able to protect the paper edges),  black .5 mm [Pilot Precise pen](http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/185-Precise-V5-V7.aspx) and my mechanical pencil.  I highly recommend Staedtler's [Mars plastic eraser](http://www.staedtler.ca/Mars_plastic_na) - it erases very cleanly and doesn't stain paper or rip it up.

As for the list you provided, these are the products I would recommend based on use /experience:

**An easy to erase, (non-photo) blue or red pencil for initial sketches** I personally would stick to your default pencil unless you plan on doing a lot of scanning and your sketching is a bit wild.  I really try to keep things simple / use objects that are flexible or can be multi-purpose.

**A set of traditional pencils (2H, HB and 2B maybe) and a pencil sharpener or knife** The Staedtler pencil sets have the combination you mentioned and are very good quality pencils.  I also carry an X-acto handle with a box of #11 blades.

**A mechanical pencil (0.5/0.7/0.9 with HB leads) for details** I use a Pentel mechanical pencil, but it's no longer being made.  I am not sure I could recommend one other than that, but I have had very good experience with Pentel and their mechanical pencils.  I recommend a slim pencil that is easy to modify your grip upon - one without a thickened handle or strange form.  


**Eraser(s)** A Staedtler Mars plastic eraser.  I have tried a few other plastic erasers (and of course other erasers), but for the reasons mentioned above, I very much prefer this eraser.

**Some black (or gray?) pens** Pilot Precise v5/v7 pens - I use the .5 mm pens.  

**Set of maybe 15 grey scale and/or brown markers** Prismacolor makes a few really great sets of [warm, cool and neutral gray, dual-tipped markers](http://www.prismacolor.com/products/art-markers/double-ended) that are really great.  To be honest, I had a kind of low expectation from them, but the markers really are quite good.  I've only used the grey sets and one of the color sets in terms or their markers, though.  I believe there were 12 to a set.  This link will probably give you [a better idea of the format](http://www.dickblick.com/products/prismacolor-premier-double-ended-art-markers/) - Prismacolor's site was messy and not fun to navigate."

I'm not a hardcore gamer, I just want a solid laptop that is better than the 6 year old Lenovo I am using (I often get 15fps with lowest setting playing something as bland as Divinity II), so I assume any one of these computers will suit my need, is there any reason I would choose one over another at this point?"
