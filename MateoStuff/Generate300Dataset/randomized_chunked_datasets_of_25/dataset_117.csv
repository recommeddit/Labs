72008,"First off, Michael Caine never goes into the dream world. If he's in a scene, it's reality.

The idea of inception is to implant an idea so deep in someone's subconscious that they think it's their own idea.

Each ""level"" is a kind of metaphor to go deeper into the subconscious. Like, they need the intial mark to dissolve his dad's company or something (I can't really remember what the original goal was exactly), and to do that they ultimately convince his subconscious (him, deeper in the dream) that he has a secret locked away in his mind. That's what leads to that snow level being basically a vault in a fortress. They have to convince him that he's breaking into his own mind to reveal a secret, when in actuality, what's in the vault is what he deeply desires to be true. That ""memory"" is what his subconscious wanted to be locked away. In truth, there was no ""hidden secret"" but they were so deep, and he was so yearning for his father's approval, that they were able to trick his mind at that deep of a level.",best movies with a cool twist
