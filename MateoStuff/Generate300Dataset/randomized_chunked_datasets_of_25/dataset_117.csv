After an explosion/disaster, Lister is the only (living) human. Rimmer (now deceased) is a hologram, proving that death is no longer a career impediment. The ships cat mutated to human form but still thinks like a cat mostly. The AI computer is very sarcastic."

53855,best medicine for a cold,"For strep throat (I got this from my fencing club president, surprisingly works) the first day, when it's just a tickle and you know where it's going, gargle 5 1/2 shots of rum (has to be a half shot at a time, not all at once, any strong alcohol can suffice) twice a day, every day until well, or going to class drunk isn't fun anymore."

A couple years ago I hijacked her desktop and laptop and made backgrounds from MS Paint that said ""My mommy is the smartest lady"" and ""My mommy is the best!"" She hasn't changed them.
Mom's are great once we kids stop being shits all the time."
72008,best movies with a cool twist,"First off, Michael Caine never goes into the dream world. If he's in a scene, it's reality.

The idea of inception is to implant an idea so deep in someone's subconscious that they think it's their own idea.

Each ""level"" is a kind of metaphor to go deeper into the subconscious. Like, they need the intial mark to dissolve his dad's company or something (I can't really remember what the original goal was exactly), and to do that they ultimately convince his subconscious (him, deeper in the dream) that he has a secret locked away in his mind. That's what leads to that snow level being basically a vault in a fortress. They have to convince him that he's breaking into his own mind to reveal a secret, when in actuality, what's in the vault is what he deeply desires to be true. That ""memory"" is what his subconscious wanted to be locked away. In truth, there was no ""hidden secret"" but they were so deep, and he was so yearning for his father's approval, that they were able to trick his mind at that deep of a level."

55610,best action and adventure novel series,"If you can find it, *Stalking the Unicorn* is a pretty good read. Detective style book in an alternate New York with cat people, elves, ect.

And *The Homecoming Saga* is way better than the *Ender* series. It kept me entertained, but it might turn off a more attentive reader who notices (sooner than I did) that it's the Book of Mormon or something."

I like growth and dividends."
