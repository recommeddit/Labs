58829,best cologne,"Sort of in line with what has already been said... You need to go to a store that allows samples, put a bit of one on your right wrist and a bit of another on your left wrist. Smell them initially and then again in 6-hrs or so, the latter smell (called ""base notes"" in fragrance wanker terminology) should be what determines which you go for. Fragrances react differently with each person's skin and their natural skin oils, so something that smells good on you might not suit me. You can also match them to the season / your outfit.

That said, you're gonna see heaps of suggestions, and this thread comes up basically once a month in MFA. Some of the ones commonly and consistently suggested are:

Burberry Brit

Bleu de Chanel

La Nuit De L'homme by YSL

Creed Aventus

Creed Green Irish Tweed

Acqua di Gio

Tom Ford - Tobacco Vanille

Armani Code

Ralph Lauren Polo Black

My personal cheat list for everyday wear colognes (if you can't be bothered with trying them out for yourself):

Polo Black

Burberry Brit

Bleu de Chanel

My date night cologne is Tom Ford Noir EDP. But lets be honest, the cologne you're wearing doesn't really mean much."
