"You ain't never had a squeaky clean butthole til you've tried washing with a detachable shower head. Especially if you get one where you can switch to a stream instead of spray.

Overall eletric vehicles aren't at that point where I would be considering buying one.

EDIT:Not related to the subject at hand, but damn OP isn't really doing well in his life after i clicked on his profile and saw that post he made. I don't trully know what to say about that, but I hope life gets better for you."
"Elementary OS is quite nice. It has sane defaults and editing is quite pleasant. Granted, if you want to do any customizing, you'll need to get your hands dirty with the terminal, but it's good for staying out of your way."
"Play some The Cure and let it talk about its feelings. Once it hits 20 or so, it'll mature up"
"Doubt it. Were pretty poor in the qualifiers, lost a couple of nations league games and I doubt we picked up many points in the play offs."
I've got one of these on the way after my experience with the 4S Lifeproof case. I've heard that there is some muffling of the earpiece. Have you experienced that?
"The problem with Shawn is that he is exactly the opposite of what snowboarding is about. He goes for medals, tries to be the best ever, and only does pipe and spins. Considering this is such a small part of snowboarding and the culture, he's pretty much been ostracized from the community.

Honestly, I think the guy just needs a friend."
"One of my favorite things to do is to plop myself down at the counter at my favorite diner, order a cup of coffee, a bowl of fruit, and maybe an egg sandwich, and just nibble, sip from the constantly refilled cup of coffee, and read the local paper for 2-4 hours.  It costs about $10, including tip, fills me up with caffeine and good food, and is very informative and relaxing."
"GreyStillPlays has the same energy as both of them, if you don't watch his videos do it. He's great."

"If durability matters a lot, I'd say go for the Lenovo ThinkPad L14. The added benefits are that you get upgradable RAM and storage, and you get a more durable laptop. The Flex 5 is still a decent 2-in-1 option, though."

"I am not in bioinformatics currently, though I am a published author in bioinformatics (Scientific Reports; a novel algorithm and software system designed for use by CRISPR genetic editing researchers; happy to talk with you about it if you're interested.) I now work in higher education on a number of projects. Some of the details are a little hush-hush right now because I work with privacy-protected information, but a paper is forthcoming on my largest project: how I achieve pretty amazingly high accuracy predicting grades across the entire college for non-traditional adult students."

"I'm not a manager or hiring person. However, in the circumstance above where I googled an employee or looked them up on facebook and I couldn't find anything on them... I'd think they were either really good at keeping themselves personal... Or they were a shut in. It wouldn't effect whether or not I interviewed the person, but I'd keep an eye out for anti-social tendencies. Regardless of your position, you're most likely going to have to work with other people. And if you're a front-facing position you'll have to do it often and with people you won't like. Being social and friendly is always a positive to an employer."
