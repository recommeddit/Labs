18644,"Lindsay Ellis brought me to Contrapoints, who is just delightful. She's an ex-philosophy professor who makes really well-produced, hilarious, and intelligent video essays on current social issues.

Also

Jenny Nicholson for, as someone else put it, very dry humor nerd movie reviews, 

friendlyjordies for funny dress up and accents with funny commentary on mostly Australian politics, 

and Aunty Donna for fantastic absurdist skits.

And sips, a lovely Canadian man who plays PC games.",best YouTube video

23687,"Underground 1 is the better racing game. Really good sense of speed and I prefer the car handling. Tracks are more suited to racing. Great, motivating soundtrack.

Underground 2 is the better PimpMyRide game. Much bigger choice of parts, more indepth performance tuning, and cars are more visually detailed as a whole. And the best open world city in a racing game. Full stop.

I personally prefer Underground 1 but Underground 2 has its place as well. Both games are some of the best car games ever.",best car racing video game

40956,"In a way, yes. If your looking to become pro, then you need to learn a wide array of instruments. 

The question was just 1 instrument though, and learning a single percussion instrument is alot easier then most others. 

Other then a full drum kit (which is hard for sure), you dont have to over think most of the process, whereas while playing something like a piano, you have to be mindful of the note selection in both hands, syncopation, patterns, rhythm and the sight reading. 

It may be subjective but I know which one is more challenging for me haha",best instrument to play

Flavor I thought I wouldn't like: Pistachio. I'd never even eaten a pistachio and didn't know what to expect from it. I absolutely love it though.

Strangest flavor: Black sesame was a very new flavor to me, though I realize it's not unusual. So was lavender rose when I first made it.",best ice cream flavor

SDSU (my school) is the flagship CSU so they're always trying to be the top. Hirschman has shifted the culture here in the last decade to a more academically known school and is trying his best to shake off that party school vibe it's known for.
As for the other csus I would say Long Beach, Fullerton, and SFSU are the better ones alongside SDSU. If you got any questions feel free to pm me!",best college in california
63735,"7 Habits is awesome. It deals with the fundamental underpinnings of why you're having trouble. So many other books try to fix the problem way out on the far branches. Covey strikes the root.

Then read Getting Things Done. Its subtitle is ""The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"". That's exactly what it'll give you.

But read 7 Habits first. 

And right around the time you start reading 7 Habits, begin exercising. Seriously. It will make an enormous difference. Don't know what to do? Even a brisk 20 minute walk three times a week will do wonders. Push yourself, get a little winded, don't dog it, but don't kill yourself either. You'll be amazed how much it helps almost immediately. You'll feel like you found some new miracle drug that reduces anxiety while increasing energy, mental clarity, and confidence.",best books for time management reddit
