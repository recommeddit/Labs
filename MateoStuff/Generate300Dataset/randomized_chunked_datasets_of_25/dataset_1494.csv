49409,best gaming monitor,"Thinking about a 1440p as well, and after research I am torn between LG 27GL850 and Asus VG27AQ. Also I don't know if I should go for a high refresh rate with an rtx 2060."
64545,Best Nike running shoes,"Far be it from me to attempt to slow the relentless march of capitalism, but I hope y'all are aware that there is [no evidence whatsoever](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18424485) that these shoes benefit your running.

Happy retail therapy!"
7491,best laptop for general use,"If things don't go well, you can always return it and try another device."
18644,best YouTube video,"Lindsay Ellis brought me to Contrapoints, who is just delightful. She's an ex-philosophy professor who makes really well-produced, hilarious, and intelligent video essays on current social issues.

Also

Jenny Nicholson for, as someone else put it, very dry humor nerd movie reviews, 

friendlyjordies for funny dress up and accents with funny commentary on mostly Australian politics, 

and Aunty Donna for fantastic absurdist skits.

And sips, a lovely Canadian man who plays PC games."
15225,best tree for the garden,Bur oak! <3
3775,best college for research,"Some Indians just love to bitch about themselves, even when there is evidence to the contrary like in this case. No matter how much progress occurs, these people will keep talking trash to get approval. I'm pretty sure the university ranking groups have a much better way of recognizing whether a university's research is ""fake research"" or not than you do. Grow up."
50641,best rap album,"Beats, Rhymes, and life - A Tribe Called Quest"
23687,best car racing video game,"Underground 1 is the better racing game. Really good sense of speed and I prefer the car handling. Tracks are more suited to racing. Great, motivating soundtrack.

Underground 2 is the better PimpMyRide game. Much bigger choice of parts, more indepth performance tuning, and cars are more visually detailed as a whole. And the best open world city in a racing game. Full stop.

I personally prefer Underground 1 but Underground 2 has its place as well. Both games are some of the best car games ever."
20561,best workout music,Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes
61237,Best RPG game on PS4,"Awesome! I'm gonna try it, thank you so much :)"
27671,best bollywood actor,really? I find her very cringe. especially the dialogue delivery
18248,best YouTube video,Shia lebeouf...
54796,best water filter,"I use a ""Woder 10k"" Filter. I've never had the water tested but it tastes great. It removes all of the funky city water taste. It costs around $80 (on sale for $65 right noe on Amazon) to filter 10,000 gallons. For the money, you can't beat it."
40956,best instrument to play,"In a way, yes. If your looking to become pro, then you need to learn a wide array of instruments. 

The question was just 1 instrument though, and learning a single percussion instrument is alot easier then most others. 

Other then a full drum kit (which is hard for sure), you dont have to over think most of the process, whereas while playing something like a piano, you have to be mindful of the note selection in both hands, syncopation, patterns, rhythm and the sight reading. 

It may be subjective but I know which one is more challenging for me haha"
1458,best ice cream flavor,"Top 3: licorice, banana pudding, vanilla w/ maraschino cherries mixed in

Flavor I thought I wouldn't like: Pistachio. I'd never even eaten a pistachio and didn't know what to expect from it. I absolutely love it though.

Strangest flavor: Black sesame was a very new flavor to me, though I realize it's not unusual. So was lavender rose when I first made it."
45915,best trick or treating candy,"As a parent who shakes the kids down for their reese's when they walk in the door, I approve."
18214,best YouTube video,I absolutely love how he says that with a Spanish accent.
65708,best college in california,"So you got SLO which is a csu but uses a quarter system like the UCs. I would say that it ranks as a great csu and can compete with some UCs. 
SDSU (my school) is the flagship CSU so they're always trying to be the top. Hirschman has shifted the culture here in the last decade to a more academically known school and is trying his best to shake off that party school vibe it's known for.
As for the other csus I would say Long Beach, Fullerton, and SFSU are the better ones alongside SDSU. If you got any questions feel free to pm me!"
63735,best books for time management reddit,"7 Habits is awesome. It deals with the fundamental underpinnings of why you're having trouble. So many other books try to fix the problem way out on the far branches. Covey strikes the root.

Then read Getting Things Done. Its subtitle is ""The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"". That's exactly what it'll give you.

But read 7 Habits first. 

And right around the time you start reading 7 Habits, begin exercising. Seriously. It will make an enormous difference. Don't know what to do? Even a brisk 20 minute walk three times a week will do wonders. Push yourself, get a little winded, don't dog it, but don't kill yourself either. You'll be amazed how much it helps almost immediately. You'll feel like you found some new miracle drug that reduces anxiety while increasing energy, mental clarity, and confidence."
46765,best hand santizer brand,"So buy what is out of stock lol

Adam's polishes hand sanitizer. Buy that"
52128,best iphone case,I think spigen is an exceptional case manufacturer and it's built quality is top-notch! I use a neo metal hybrid for my daily case needs! I couldn't ask for more! Perfect balance between bulkyness and protection and it has aluminum too!
43243,best detective show,I'd recommend fargo. It's really good.
57404,best water brand,"Echoing the same as everyone else but yeah Dasani since it tastes like vaguely salty water that had a penny marinating in the bottom of the bottle, nestle tastes like you left it in the car for too long and the company is literally run by demons."
69054,best science fiction novel,"Ender's game, Calibans War (The expanse), The Curcuit."
39877,best Chrome extensions,"""The one, desire..."""
