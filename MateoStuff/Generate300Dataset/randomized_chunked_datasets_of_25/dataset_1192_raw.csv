"Trenchcoat, dark sunglasses, and a black, unmarked van in the driveway."
"OK, that makes more sense."
VW e-Golf. Very economical to keep and has nice quality feel.
"How about the Gulf Coast in Texas, or the Myrtle Beach area of SC?"
"I’ve had 3 pairs of these, they’re great quality especially for the price."
RIP Nardones...heard they closed yesterday. :(
I thought The Game Changers on Netflix was quite interesting. Definitely makes you think about veganism in a new light
"Book 3 is where the real change happens though. It's where his suffering and loss act as a crucible, where he loses his crutches, where he opens himself up to his potential. 

It's the hardest book of the 4 (or 5 depending on how you fit in the coda). But it's also the one is central to what went before and after for Severian.

My opinion of course. Just nice to discuss TBOTNS."
How did I just now realize that MM FOOD is an anagram of MF DOOM??

"Same hand size

Most comfy - g403 and intellimouse
Best lightweight - Skoll (i also hate the coating but grip stickers helps a bit).
Model O (glossy) - really good, needed some time to adjust to the shape.
MM710- had good resaults but my hand is too wide so hurts after a while."
Or maybe some sweet internet points down the road from catching some happenstance situation. Remember all them rad meteorite videos from Russia because everyone had a dashcam?
"It really depends. It depends on everything from the state, to the county, to the school, to the teacher. For us personally, we were taught pretty similarly and how a lot of people, including some Americans at the time, felt we were wrong and it was unnecessary"
"> When we do get sick, we kick it within a week, 2 max(

So you kick it within the standard timeframe for a cold."
I have two pairs of these sunglasses and they are awesome. I've bought them for people as well and universally they are loved. I can't speak to the lens hardness and clarity (other than I wear them and often forget to take them off). Take good care of them and they will last forever. Highly recommended
I love my wave riders!
"Hi, is a refurbished device is okay?"
I’m recommending this on everything because I watched it a day ago and I loved it so much that I literally can’t shut the fuck up about it. Check out Arlington Road
"I like playing on both idk. Computer for some games and Xbox for others

Also friends who only have one or the other"
"TSM, Tesla, Palantir, INTC, PayPal"
"The switch, mostly because it has a good number of games that I am interested in playing. So far the other 2 consoles haven't released games that I personally am intereseted in enough to warrent buying another console. PS4 got close with Monster Hunter World but that came out on PC aswell so I bought it for PC instead of buying a PS4."
Sadly also sold out atm ;(
"Where are you watching it? I've been dying to see it, but can't find it anywhere."
"If you're on a mac I highly recommend Koala. Its a much better GUI than Scout. Also besides setting up scout on your machine DON'T LISTEN TO THE GUY, he says about as many wrong things as right."
"I don't think you can produce a good sounding note on the recorder on the first day, though."
