68134,best science fiction novel,"Yes, it's a sequel to Grass, but barely - Raising the Stones could stand alone. Grass is good, too, but Raising the Stones is the one I like best."
16633,best pet for toddlers,"I don't think the solution is just more toys. The whole environment has to be good for her. She has to feel safe and have her needs fulfilled. The fact that she's running, means she feels trapped. No amount of toys is going to change that. Also, I'll bet she climbs on the tree when you're not home. Cats are like that. If you make a big deal about wanting them to do something, they will resist."
65000,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Tarascos in Goleta has the best Cubana Torta in town, IMO.  It's like molly for your mouth.  You just want to keep rolling... I have to get it to go because it's so good, as soon as I'm done I want to eat it again."
72066,best movies with a cool twist,I really enjoyed that movie but never hear too much about it. Very underrated in my opinion.

23358,best car racing video game,"This is my type of question! From someone with a modest racing wheel setup (Thrustmaster TX Pro, Pro Pedals, Shifter), as well as an Elite Controller, here's what I have played. 

Forza Horizon Series - all 4 titles are great open world racing. Definitely not simulation, but not full arcade either. All other titles I will compare to these, as handling and car control are very neutral. On GamePass. Wheel supported.

Forza Motorsport series - 6 and 7 are very deep, a bit more difficult to control than Horizon, but just as fun. Many real and fantasy tracks, lots of cars, and lots of career progression. Graphics are great too. Online is fun, but as it's on GamePass, lots of new people. On GamePass. Wheel supported.

Dirt 4 and 5 - rally inspired, same sort of feel as Horizon setup, but more casual. Cara are very floaty, a bit more arcade based. Cannot tune vehicles either. Tracks only, not open world. Car selection is lower, as is tracks. Fun game. Feels like they are trying harder to be ""young"", but to me feels a bit hollow. 4 is in GamePass. 5 is not. 4 is wheel supported, t is not yet. 

Dirt Rally / 2.0 - similar to Dirt series, but more sim. Cars handle more heavy, and are thus much harder to control. Most races are point to point as real rally is. Small car selection, but very entertaining. Worth it if you enjoy time trials, and rally racing. On GamePass. Wheel supported.

Project cars 1 and 2 - more sim based than Forza. 1 is decent, 2 is a serious upgrade. Less cars than Forza 7, but more real tracks. Lots of cool career progression. Racing series have warm ups, time trials, qualifying, races, pitting, race strategies, etc. AI is very good in this too. Control of cars with controller is not easy off the start, but there are HUGE customization choices, with lots of settings available online to make the cars feel heavier, and more like other, easier racing games. Online is good, wheels are heavily supported.

Project Cars 3 - newest PC game, feels like s step back from PC2, smaller game, less cars, worse graphics. Feels like as if Dirt series were on tracks. Structure feels very much like a mobile game. Weird progression. Wheel supported, though not very good. 

Grid (2019) and others - this is another arcadey type series, sort of a cross between Project Cars 2, Forza Motorsport 7, Dirt 4 and 5. Very cool career progression, good car selection, though not as large as PC2 or FM7. Cars feel light and quick, racing is very fast and very high energy. Tracks are real world and lots of Fantasy. Online isn't that great, but career mode in this is massively diverse, many types of cars. Wheels are supported well here as well. 

Assetto Corsa - more sim than most of the others. PC2 and Forza Similar, though car control is probably the most real, and most frustrating with a controller. Easy to change settings to find something that works, but controls must be very smooth. Lots of track selection, lots of cars. Lots of tuning. Online is good, though not massive population. This game on PC is one of the go tos with mods and add-ons, but on console leaves a bit to be desired. Very comparable to Gran Turismo series on PlayStation. Wheel supported very well.

Assetto Corsa Competizione - a GT based titled from AC. Small amount of cars. Good track selection. Controls like AC, very very very sim based. Hard to control with a controller unless you are very very experienced. Online is great, but very league based. Great wheel support. 

Need For Speed series - Heat is Newest. Similar feel to Horizon, open world. Lots to do, day and night racing. Lots of car customization. The most if visual mods are your thing. Car control is very arcade like. Very quick. But easy to tune, and definitely fun to play. Online is good. Wheel support isn't very strong. On GamePass

Need for speed Hot Pursuit Remastered - a 2010 game, redone. Very fun. Time leaderboards setup. Sense of speed is unreal. Lots of wrecks and crazy crashes. You play as street racers, as well as cops. Takedowns and crashes are lots of fun. Not a huge car selection, but online cops and robbers is solid cross play stuff. Pretty cheap title too. 

F1 Series - good F1 racing. Obviously f1 cars, and F1 event tracks. Sense of speed is good, if you love F1 racing you'll probably really love the game. Good career mode. Very much a simulation of the F1 series. Wheel supported. On game pass.  Very good online. 

Nascar series - same as F1 notes, only Nascar based. A bit more arcade feeling than F1, but everything else applies the same. Wheel supported. On GamePass I believe. Very good online.

Wreckfest - very arcade, very fun demolition derby type crashes and races. Very good physics. Online is tons of fun if you like crashing. Can be found at good prices too. 

Hotshot racing - 90s style 16/32 bit racing. Super fast super fun. On GamePass. You gotta give it a go. 

Burnout Paradise Remastered - same group of people that went on to do Hot Pursuit Remastered. This is ultimate arcade high speed, crashing fun. Open world. Very crash based. Extremely good sense of speed. Car selection is not great, all are made up cars, but based on real life ones. 

My most played titles with a controller are Forza Horizon, Forza Motorsport, Grid 2019, Need For Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered, Wreckfest, Burnout. 

My most played with a wheel are Project Cars 2, Assetto Corsa, Forza 7.

This is not all, but a good base of what available. Anything that might interest you, I would encourage you to hop on YouTube and do a bit of quick video watching to see if it floats your boat before you buy. If it's on GamePass, just download and give it a try. 

YouTube and channels that have good racing game content are FailRace, Jimmy Broadbent, Stevio 2175, Slap Train, Super GT, Yorkie065, Chris Davis, Don Joewon Song.

If you have any questions about something specific, ask away. In more than willing to give you deeper perspective! I hope this helps out more than just you!"

27049,best board games,"Saw this on the â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ tab and imagined families going straight from Monopoly to A Feast For Odin. Put them off board games for life.

I do really enjoy FfO, itâ€™s more of an experiment in mapping history to board game mechanics, if it werenâ€™t the dedication to the theme then, really, thereâ€™s no need for the game to have quite that much stuff. Iâ€™d be interested to see a FfO lite with a more focused board but retaining the Patchwork puzzle for each player."

30253,best Mexican war to study,The Mexican-American war is taught as a brief disagreement with Mexico that was mostly unremarkable and ended with the US getting a bunch of Indian Territory. Mostly. The character of the Mexicans or their government isn't really addressed and I learned it during the 6th or 7th grade as part of Texas history.
68747,best science fiction novel,"I definitely consider Frankenstein Science Fiction. Itâ€™s kind of a Gothic SF novel which is something you donâ€™t see very often. But I also agree about 20,000 Leagues. I love that book!"

16754,best pet for toddlers,"> An acquaintaince of mine who used to work in insurance told me most of the bite claims he saw were for Golden Retrievers.

One reason why I make sure my dogs are 100% kid broke is that I know that at some point in their lives, some stupid parents will allow their kids to run screaming into their faces. 

So no matter how much my younger dog may be a high flying tough guy, he knows, kid gets in my face, I wag wag wag and it will be ok. 

I have had parents allow their kids to mob my middle dog at the local farmer's market, and look at me like I'm a bug on their shoe, when I suggest that maybe, just maybe, they may want to be sure that the dog their kid is hugging is actually ok with kids. 

>The problem is likely that they have such a good reputation that people think they can let the kid just do whatever to the dog.

Yup. And I'm not going to change the world, so to protect my dogs, I make sure they can handle kids, even poorly raised ones."
