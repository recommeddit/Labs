Nice! I never knew that trail exist existed.
"I have no complaints about the execution of captured US-citizen San Patricios by the USA.

I’ve read that later Mexican general/warlord/revolutionary president Obregon was descended from an Irishman named O’Brian."
Trails of cold steel
"Fave - Kim. All day. Every day. Twice on a Sunday.

Least Fave - Kourt."
"I use it on Linux, works the exact same as windows/OSX"
"Definitely feel the same way as you in the first part of your comment. In a different mood it would prob be MotM, Blackstar, Piñata, etc"
"A nasal irrigation kit - either the electronic pump or simply the squeeze bottles. I started using them both leading up to surgery on my sinuses, and I haven't stopped using them since. It takes some getting used to, but the relief and clean feeling is amazing."
"Same here. I don't get why people use axios in the frontend. In node with no fetch, I MIIIGHT understand, but even then request/request-promise is perfectly enough."
Definitely either Kali or Arch.
thanks for this - more things to look at as time allows
"Happy for men


My first G/F ever gave me a bottle and I still use it"
"USB-C absolutely does use higher voltage than USB-A. USB-C charges at voltages of 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V, whereas USB-A was (with very few special exceptions) 5V only."
"Similarly, a fire extinguisher"
The smell of someone's sweat can apparently be attributed to how well someone looks after their nutrition intake and physical health.
"Seconding both of these recs. The Fall is so insanely beautiful with such a great story behind it, and ESoaSM is just... it draws you in with so much intensity and just forces you to feel all these different, crushing emotions. Also a beautiful film as well."
If you open them using the tsa key it changes color. If you shove two tools in there and twist it does not. So i guess i would say access but both really bc technically it is a tamper evident device.
">(to start a family, to build strong relationships, to own real estate)

Most likely the country you are from."
"Perhaps he suffers from the fact that no-one can agree on his best book. There isn't a standout single book that everyone recommends. I remember a ""Britains favourite books"" TV show from 10-25 years ago, Terry Pratchett didn't get near the top 10, but did have about a dozen books in the top 200."
I feel like I am the only person in the world who can’t get into the Outlander series.  What am I doing wrong??
"Draw Foxy's ass when you get those pencils, it's ingrained well into that brain of yours and I think you'd nail it"
"Leave the porch light on; that is the sign that you are handing out candy. Leave the door open if you don't want the bell ringing every thirty seconds. There is nothing wrong with handing out one or two pieces per kid, although if it is a really good kid or especially good costume, I will give a little extra. Don't leave the bowl outside, and don't offer them the bowl unless you are prepared to be a dick when they inevitably try to take advantage of you.

If/when you run out of candy, just turn off your porch light/unplug any Halloween lights, close your door, and leave a nice note saying something like ""Sorry, out of candy. See you next year!"" Most kids will just pass by when they see paper on the door. I live in a pretty nasty neighborhood, and I have never had problems with TPing or egging or anything, but keep any pets inside tomorrow and Monday. People can get nasty around Halloween.

Have fun!"
"Started watching him because he was the only guy I could find reviewing Sims DLCs, but I kept watching because his videos on old tech and games were just too fascinating to ignore."
That Bath and Body Works Sweet Pea never failed me in middle school.
"> Movies like Arrival

May I interest you in *Close Encounters with the Third Kind*?"
Just finished! Excellent ending. This book almost had me in tears at a couple places. Off to start the prequel series! Did I see somewhere that you are writing a series that takes place after revelations?
