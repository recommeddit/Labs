11045,best backpack for college,"Everlane or Jansport? I have a 2 year everlane and I think I'm going to replace it since it's showing so much signs of wear. However I think it's still going fine.

Do you have other suggestions?"
72114,best movies with a cool twist,"Cabin in the woods wasn't much of a twist ending though, they reveal it at the beginning."
40139,best Chrome extensions,"I only use uBlock Origin and Tampermonkey. I actually have a script that blocks all the things that uBlock Origin doesn't. I also have a bunch of other scripts, like one that always moves Continue Watching and My List to the top of Netflix. I used to make them ""sticky"" at the top of the screen, but that actually got annoying."

1971,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I agree with you, I’m not a deep dish fan but I’m keeping it out of the post. That being said, there are distinct indicators of quality.  It’s safe to say that a burrito that comes with a cold mission tortilla is a low-quality burrito, just like pizza made outside of a good pizza oven with cheap sponge crust is likely a low quality pizza."
38667,best newspapers to read,"I'd recommend the economist.  It gives a decent briefing on the week's news and then launches into a series of in depth articles, largely in a well-sourced editorial style where they argue for a particular point of view.  Well written and well worth your time."

39646,best podcast for biologists,If you're interested in exploring careers/lives of scientists that took 'the path less traveled' then the [Jobs In Science Podcast](www.JobsInScience.ca) is worth a listen. I'd start with Ep3.
52357,best hiphop album,"I don't think Kendrick, Danny Brown or shadow belong in the top 10. Those are all great albums but I'd sooner include - ready to die, ob4cl, blueprint, mmlp, paid in full, college dropout, black album, get rich or die trying, it's dark hell is hot, Wu Tang forever"
17598,best iOS game,Too bad the Devs gave up on it. I LOVE that game.

47459,best state to visit in the United States,Make it happen!

60130,best freezer brand,"<and they're a bit easier to come by

But arguably meaner."
