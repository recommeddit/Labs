"Converse actually *are* properly constructed for heavy weightlifting. They have a wide solid base with minimal interference between your feet and the floor - aside from sock feet, which many places don't allow, converse are often the next best option."

"Assetto Corsa  
It's currently the best driving sim for drifting with it's physics and good amount of mods available (tracks, cars, etc). Also it's run really well and works good with multiple monitors."

"Elgato just came out with a new camera. It's their first, and also the first that's actually pretty damn good! Give it a search!"
"NOTE:  
The Console and PC versions were made by two completely different dev teams.  

The console version offers an arcade-like and heavily watered down experience.   
The PC version was designed as a simulator where you progress through the era of Porsche automobiles, with real crash physics, a detailed progression system, money to earn and upgrade your cars, and it also contains a lot of historic information about each and every Porsche in the game in the form of videos.    

If you only ever played the console version or you were a fan of the ""simmy"" aspects from the very first Need for Speed(from Road&Track magazine), you owe it to yourself to find and play NFS: Porsche unleashed.  

It runs well on modern systems and can be modded to support 21:9 aspect ratios."
"yea ur only hope is the previous ultralights or the Model D which isnt released yet, and those arent guaranteed to fit either as the Skoll is pretty damn big. 

might as well just adjust ur grip to fit smaller mice if neither of those will work"

This would be the quintessential 'starter pack' of anime. If you're going to introduce anime to someone a lot those shows would be recommended for first time watchers.

"That's a fair point. I guess I was more referring to *thin* from the developer/consumer perspective in that the browser has become so ubiquitous you can essentially take it for granted and abstract away that complexity when you're developing web apps. That being said, you're absolutely right that the browser itself as a piece of software in itself is not simple or thin."

Ryzen chips are heavily reliant on ram isn't it ? I heard that lesser ram would get you lesser performance for the ryzen 2600 or 2600x
Keep this going as a tradition. It would be the coolest thing.
"If we only have one John Scalzi book, I would put Old Man's War on there ahead of Redshirts. Redshirts is definitely different, but Old Man's War in Scalzi's defining book thus far."
Why would that even be a thing? What the hell is a fridge for if you can't stick magnets to it? WHY WOULD SOMEONE CREATE THAT?
I had some friends whom were adamant about not seeing it so I never saw it in theaters. I saw it a few months ago finally and I freaking loved it. Everything from the videogamish setting to the characters interactions with each other was just enjoyable all around. I can't wait to see the sequel when that eventually come out.
"I'm gonna be honest, I live in a cold ass place and electric cars are proven not to last long here because the battery tech is not at its peak yet. I'm not a fan and I really perform gas cars still. However I really like the concept of hydrogen vehicles and I test drove a Toyota Mirai and I can honestly see myself owning one at some point once they're released up here. It didn't have the feel of an electric car it felt like an every day gas car and i was very impressed. I hope the technology takes off"

That you know of. With TSA's theft problem I could see this being useful.
"Yes, that's the feeling I get. Speaking of programming in Switzerland, considering it's one of the best economies in the world, how much do web developers make there? Are there a lot of positions available for qualified people? My friend had a Swiss girlfriend and said he sometimes had to pay $20+ for a hamburger there, so maybe a lot of USD wouldn't go a long way. :)"
