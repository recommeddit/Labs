Suppose I am dealing with *unsafe* water. I'm currently in a country where the tap water is not safe to drink (and not just for my yankee guts; everyone boils it before drinking it). What I'm doing is running the tap water through the Brita filter first and *then* boiling it; the idea being to have the Brita filter remove the heavy metals, and then the boiling to kill off the germs. Does that make a difference?"

40197,best midrange CPU,"> cOrReCt AnSwErs:

> 3700x and 10700k will age gracefully 

xD

If they are getting beaten atm by cheaper CPUs atm, they'd continue getting beaten by cheaper CPUs for at least a couple of years. 6c/12t wouldn't magically become outdated ""soon"" and it's not like 8c/16t would be protected or much better. But that isn't going to happen for at least 2-3 years so it's an entirely pointless point you are making. 

 And the money you are saving atm in buying a cheaper cpu and cheaper mobo can be used to buy better ones when you upgrade in a few years. It's not like 10900k would demolish the CPUs in 3 years time. Even the mid range alternatives would probably at worst be equal. Meanwhile you are telling people to spend more money NOW and get worse performance NOW, only to then once again have to upgrade at the exact same time.


At the moment 4c/4t are slowly becoming outdated though they still run most games over 100 fps, meanwhile you think that 6c/12t would magically become garbage in the 2-4 years before you upgrade? 2500k can still pump out 100+ fps in most games. A 10 year old processor... Even though 3700x would age a bit better, even if you keep your processor for 5 years it'd likely still be equal/worse than the 5600x in gaming. Devs can't just raise the requirements as high as humanly possible when 80% of the community is still rocking a 4c/4t and a 1060 3gb. These things are very slow and gradual. You should be extremely safe buying a 6c/12t as they'd likely become the new low standard that 4c/4t has been for many years now. 

Unless you need only the cores/productivity it makes 0 sense to buy these processors. 5600x is actually a bit cheaper in my country than 3700x and it's faster in gaming and only slightly slower in productivity. You can buy 5600x, enjoy a much better gaming experience and then upgrade in 2-3 years with the newest mid range component and it'd be way faster than your 3700x because not only would the 7000 CPU be much faster, you'd also be moving to ddr5.

11400f is quite easily one of the best processors you can buy atm because it's much cheaper than the processors it's rivaling and it doesn't make much sense to go all out and buy a 5900x when ddr5 and ryzen 7000 are on the way. Buying a 3700x over it is asinine unless you really need the extra bit of multi core performance and you need it right now. It's a pricier CPU that also performs worse and would most likely continue performing worse even at the time of your upgrade. It's much smarter to buy the faster and cheaper CPU and save the extra money to upgrade to ryzen 7000/8000/9000 and ddr5 in a few years.

P.S. Unless you have lots of money to spare and want the best of the best even if it's only 5% improvement for double the price, it makes no sense to buy the flagship or in this case even the one below the flag ship. 5800x vs 5600x is a no brainer if you are talking about gaming, which is exactly what you are promoting them as. ""Good enough for a few years. Best gaming CPUs"". There's absolutely no reason to buy a 5800x if your goal is gaming. None. You are spending 150 dollars more for an almost nonexistent gain(it's like 1% on average). I could sell my CPU, mobo and ram and use that extra 150 and upgrade in a year or two and it'd still be cheaper and that CPU would be faster than the 5800x in every single way."
