"The lightest budget (i.e. less than 30$) mouse I know is the Gigabyte Aorus M2 (76g), followed by the Nixeus Revel (82g). EVGA Torq X5 is pretty light too (83g)."
Yay!  We got another one!
"Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, one of my favorite books. Really explores Russian family life and relationships. 

If you want a fucked up, non traditional romance novel check out Lolita by Nabokov. Beautifully written. 

Then again, if you want a feel-good read maybe these are best avoided."
"I also love Benjamin moore paints, but can't figure out how to buy it in 5 gallon buckets."
I definitely agree. This thread is rampant with users just making up statistics.
"Ive had my northface recon backpack for almost 10 years now. Had it all through high school, college, and multiple hikes, its still in as good of shape as the day i bought it. The newer NF backpack designs dont look as cool in my opinion, but theyre built to amazing quality and durability. Couldnt recommend it enough."
Pun intended?
"I own one pair of sunglasses, I wear glass and so these are prescription sunglasses. I only have one pair because prescription glasses are expensive. [They are the ones on the left](http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1373605961/457/8912457_600x400.jpg)

Prescription glasses are interesting in that most people take their sunglasses off indoors because the shade makes it harder to see. I leave mine on because no matter how dark it is indoors, I can see a tonne better with them. Rude people have commented on it before and then I have to explain that I forgot my regular glasses and can't see if I take my sunnies off."
"This is cheating because I responded to the post yesterday with my pick, but I really don't miss an opportunity to recommend these books. Milla Vane's series A Gathering of Dragons fits every almost every request one could make. Do you like romances that feature a pet? We have a saber-tooth tiger, horses, and wolves. Do you like enemies to lovers? What about friends to lovers to enemies to lovers? Both are included! There is even a novella that features fated mates. If you like road trips, Vane has you covered.  If you want an LGBTQ friendly fantasy universe, people can marry whoever they want in this world. 

The only threads that I cannot recommend it to are those asking for children and people who like their romances smut free."

"Guardiola's Barca. I think that team played the most beautiful passing football, and just dominated every team in its path. They beat madrid 6-2, 5-0 and completely dominated man utd in ucl final."
"My dentist and ortho always recommend Act above all over mouthwashes, despite using Listerine in the office. Mostly to repair and prevent enamel damage, it seriously works."
"As someone that is about to start articling in one week I have a few things to say (keep in mind Canadian experience here). 

1. There is no such thing as pre-law. You are doing an undergrad, there are not specific classes needed to get into law. 

2. My first Torts class the Prof said this to the entire class. ""All of you think you are smart and you probably are smart, relative to the rest of the population, but here half of you are idiots. You are used to getting A's and A+'s, you will now get C's and C+'s. No longer are you the smartest person in a room, you are lucky if you are the 20th smartest person in this room, that's how smart everyone is around you and multiply that by 100 once you get into the actual legal field.""

3. Jobs are super hard to come by, they involve long hours and it's mostly bitch work that real lawyers don't want to do because it bores them."

"I bought an old fire boat from a scrapyard for $100 years ago, ended up trading it for an amazing jet boat with a 454. I was 16 and all these years later, my $100 jet boat still lives!!!"

"It's worthwhile to notice that while Engineering (or whatever) may be the most valuable degree in an objective sense, it's not necessarily what's going to make *you* the most money in the long term.

Best bet is to find something profitable that you can really devote yourself to. Motivation, dedication, and hard work pay off in the long run, and you're not going to devote yourself to something you hate."
I never was but had friends who did valet in college and this sounds very familiar.

"Yeah I think looking at the prices I'll get more value by saving $75 or so on a wired mouse. The viper wired is actually the same price as the model o in aus right now, is that a better deal?"
