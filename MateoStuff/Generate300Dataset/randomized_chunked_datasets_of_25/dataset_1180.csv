38279,"Your assumption seems to be that being ""in the center"" is somehow synonymous with ""balance"" or ""objectivity"". This is a doubtful proposition. The media in the US is comprised of major corporations, who sell audiences (readers, viewers) to other major corporations. This sort of arrangement pretty much guarantees that news stories and subsequent debate be limited to disagreements between corporate powers. What we see as ""Liberal"" and ""Conservative"", or ""Left-wing vs. Right-wing"" is really the spectrum of acceptable debate within that corporate media. Anything else is fringe or ""extremist"".",best newspapers to read

55458,"I wrote all six books of The Riyria Revelations before publishing the first. It was necessary because there was a long running arc that needed to be carefully plotted. The story starts out remarkably simply - but it grows in stakes and scope to become an epic fantasy.   Each book has it's own conflict and resolution, but there is an overarching plot (and several sub-plots) that span multiple books.

The Riyria Chronicles are done in a slightly different way. They are designed to be a series of standalone novels. For instance there are people who have read The Death of Dulgath (book #3) without #1 and #2 and it works just fine. The reason for that is I'm writing the prequels because people missed the pair after the end of Riyria Revelations. I don't want them to overstay their welcome so the plan is to release a book, take the pulse of the readers, and only release another one if it looks like people still want more. Presently there are three of these prequels and there will be a fourth...I'm just not sure when.  I'm currently doing edits on a new series of which the first book came out a few months ago.",best action and adventure novel series

33744,"The only real reason I don't care for them now is their limited range and power and the fact it takes a long time to charge them.  Plus I have this somewhat unfounded bias of battery powered devices not being consistent in power as the battery gets drained.  

With a gasoline car, power is ALWAYS there as long as you have the quantity of gas to power the engine in that moment and that aids in long range drving.  With batteries, it's more of a curve, technology depending, and performance constantly degrades ( most certainly at a rate faster than ICE).  That and in a gas car, the electricity usage doesn't as directly consume your fuel storage.  

Also they're currently expensive, have undetermined long term reliability, and currently, can't replace petrol for fun.  No exhaust note, no sound of combustion and ignition, etc.  

But there's no denying that in the long run they're probably 100% better for the environment.  I'd like one as a beater.  But not as my primary machine.",best electric car
