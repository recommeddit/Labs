49013,best gaming monitor,I got a broken S2417DG for $100 that I RMA’d and got a brand new one. Can’t say enough good things about it. The pixel density is awesome in a 24’ 1440p
71716,best movies with a cool twist,I loved Triangle. Good suggestion
70741,best movies with a cool twist,The third one was really clutch imo. Fourth onward definitely lost its jazz.
8461,best toothpaste,"Dentist from Ontario, Canada...here's my two cents on some questions below:

1. CDA Gold Seal of approval is only given to Colgate Total due to its antibacterial abilities from an agent called TRICLOSAN... essentially, it acts to kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.

2. In our dental school and the only other in our province we were all given free power toothbrushes (by Oral B, I think?).  There was one per student.  I still use mine.  Now when they poll any of us asking what toothbrush brand we use, what do you think we say?  9 out of 10 of us won't throw away free :)  They are all generally the same (hence why I can no longer remember the brand I'm using)

3.  Sensodyne and similar products contain POTASSIUM NITRATE that help reduce sensitivity - we recommend this for patients affected by sensitive teeth - but I personally believe any toothpaste with this agent is equally effective...I don't trust GlaxoSmithKline too much (nor many other big pharma)

4.  Listerine really only has effectiveness for 15 minutes for killing bacteria. After that, you are pretty much as susceptible as you were before the rinse.  Most mouthrinses contain alcohol actually dry the mouth and puts you at a greater risk for decay (less saliva = less protective effects of natural antibodies to kill bacteria and fewer minerals to reduce acid dissolving teeth)

5. Fluoride in toothpaste is always recommended as:

    - it functions to prevent the bacteria that cause decay from functioning properly (it basically screws with their metabolism so they have trouble living a normal 'bacterial life')

    - it decreases the dissolving effects of acid on teeth by increasing surface tension on the enamel (outside layer of tooth)

    - patients who are at increased risk of cavities are given prescription fluoride rinses to lower their susceptibility to tooth decay"

18360,best YouTube video,"I'm on mobile so linking is a pain from the android app, but searching for ""Fenton in Richmond Park"" has been  my go-to on several occasions

[Mobile like for those who want it](https://youtu.be/3GRSbr0EYYU)"
34941,best NFL player,"I think that's debatable. 7 more tds and 6 more ints for Wilson

I also know Watson had a much worse team around him but they only won 4 games"
55115,best places to hike in the east coast,"Love that shot in film. That grain is perfect.

I really like the XT1 for all photography. It's great to travel with (I've traveled quite a bit with it). XT2 is coming out in mid-Sept it seems, definitely recommend it if you're looking for an upgrade.

Sony a7r seems great too. A bit lighter and full frame, which is great. I do like the full metal body of the Fuji though."
59757,best perfume,I have libre and i just bought dior pure poison for a spring/summer scent and i so badly want to keep it but i feel like the dry down is almost exactly the same as libre. Only difference is libre is slightly more warm.
14459,best romantic novel,"GOSH. I'm a RWRB junkie, and I've evangelized it to all my friends. I'm also obsessed with Alyssa Cole's Reluctant Royals--those books are so funny and over the top, but the characters, sex scenes, and love stories are really good. I want everyone on this earth to read Beach Read, and I love love love Get a Life, Chloe Brown and Take a Hint, Dani Brown.  I don't think Sarah Maclean's Rules of Scoundrels series gets enough love and I shout that out on most threads, too."
60921,Best comedy show on Netflix,I don't know if I have ever watched a series quicker than the IT Crowd. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
2131,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Taffy crew checking in! I like the foghorn leg horn. Though I mostly bake it for an extra 5-10 minutes when I bring it home.


I used to love pizza guru but they finally closed. A calzone, nice salad and a drink lunch special was 10 bucks.


Also Valentinos take and bake is great."
27573,best bollywood actor,There was something about wanting to “frisk “a Hollywood actress back when he was stopped at the US airport ..I think during MNIK ... then sometime back he said I like my women to be lying down when I talk to them...don’t remember the exact quote..there have been a few more.. ofcourse they aren’t insensitive like some of the remarks made by ither superstars (if I had to compare) but they are usually passed off as witty by his fans... he’s had his fair share of WTF statements.
53584,best medicine for a cold,"They do!
Plus you can work from home an unlimited number of days."
66026,best college in california,"And this compared to our local schools which are supposed to be supplemented (before Prop 13 it was primarily funded) with local funding.

Too bad they have been severely hampered because their primary source of local funds, property taxes, do not even keep pace with inflation. Decades later local funding has shrunk so much all that's left now is state and federal life support.

Prop 13 is insidious."
32763,best vacation resort,"Currently at Le Blanc as I type this. Top notch service and food. Amazing place. Definitely a low key place, you dont come here to party. But the party zone is a 10min walk away. Definitely recommend it"
45327,best gaming system,"Ok, that is not too bad, and i gues it would have the option to charge in the car as well."
15741,best sunglasses for fashion,I'm always happy to change my opinion when proven wrong. What do you believe make the other brands mentioned here better quality as Ray Ban in this price range?
