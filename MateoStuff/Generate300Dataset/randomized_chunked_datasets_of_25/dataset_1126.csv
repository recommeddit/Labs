8461,"Dentist from Ontario, Canada...here's my two cents on some questions below:

1. CDA Gold Seal of approval is only given to Colgate Total due to its antibacterial abilities from an agent called TRICLOSAN... essentially, it acts to kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.

2. In our dental school and the only other in our province we were all given free power toothbrushes (by Oral B, I think?).  There was one per student.  I still use mine.  Now when they poll any of us asking what toothbrush brand we use, what do you think we say?  9 out of 10 of us won't throw away free :)  They are all generally the same (hence why I can no longer remember the brand I'm using)

3.  Sensodyne and similar products contain POTASSIUM NITRATE that help reduce sensitivity - we recommend this for patients affected by sensitive teeth - but I personally believe any toothpaste with this agent is equally effective...I don't trust GlaxoSmithKline too much (nor many other big pharma)

4.  Listerine really only has effectiveness for 15 minutes for killing bacteria. After that, you are pretty much as susceptible as you were before the rinse.  Most mouthrinses contain alcohol actually dry the mouth and puts you at a greater risk for decay (less saliva = less protective effects of natural antibodies to kill bacteria and fewer minerals to reduce acid dissolving teeth)

5. Fluoride in toothpaste is always recommended as:

    - it functions to prevent the bacteria that cause decay from functioning properly (it basically screws with their metabolism so they have trouble living a normal 'bacterial life')

    - it decreases the dissolving effects of acid on teeth by increasing surface tension on the enamel (outside layer of tooth)

    - patients who are at increased risk of cavities are given prescription fluoride rinses to lower their susceptibility to tooth decay",best toothpaste

I really like the XT1 for all photography. It's great to travel with (I've traveled quite a bit with it). XT2 is coming out in mid-Sept it seems, definitely recommend it if you're looking for an upgrade.

Sony a7r seems great too. A bit lighter and full frame, which is great. I do like the full metal body of the Fuji though.",best places to hike in the east coast

I'm also obsessed with Alyssa Cole's Reluctant Royals--those books are so funny and over the top, but the characters, sex scenes, and love stories are really good. I want everyone on this earth to read Beach Read, and I love love love Get a Life, Chloe Brown and Take a Hint, Dani Brown.  I don't think Sarah Maclean's Rules of Scoundrels series gets enough love and I shout that out on most threads, too.",best romantic novel

Too bad they have been severely hampered because their primary source of local funds, property taxes, do not even keep pace with inflation. Decades later local funding has shrunk so much all that's left now is state and federal life support.
