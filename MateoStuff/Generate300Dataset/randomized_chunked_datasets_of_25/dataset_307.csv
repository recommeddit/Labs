56150,best action and adventure movie,It certainly was tense but I’m more thinking of action movies with totally unrealistic set pieces where the main guy or girl just unlikely survives every blow and keeps on going.
58015,best cologne,Second that
45476,best gaming system,That’s interesting. Quite a good idea for sending things to randoms on the internet

68118,best science fiction novel,"Here's my go. No particular order:

* Anathem - Stephenson.
* Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card. 
* The Martian - Andy Weir.
* Revelation Space - Alastair Reynolds.
* The Quantum Thief - Hannu Rajaniemi."
28155,best breakfast foods,"Tasting? The breakfast burrito at Frosty's in Shady Cove, Oregon. It's on Highway 62 on the way to Crater Lake National Park. The best combo of fried spuds, grilled onions, scrambled eggs, chopped ham, chopped bacon and chopped tomatoes in a soft flour tortilla you could imagine. Served with sour cream. Delicious but not health food for sure. Other breakfast burritos just don't compare, in our opinion. The locals are going to be pissed I told Reddit about it. Try one and be smitten."

57695,best cologne,John Varvatos Classic. I'm surprise not that many people mention it.
52768,best hiphop album,And I just have to shout out Digable Planets. Only two albums and they are both the definition of timeless.
71114,best movies with a cool twist,"Planet of the apes 1968, but I guess nearly everyone would know the twist by now. If not, enjoy"
9040,best toothpaste,"I didn't floss, I paid the price.

Seriously folks, you think dentists are scary?  Try periodontal surgery.  [Have someone cut your gum away from the jawbone, peel it back, grind down the decayed and rotten *bone* then sew your gums back on again.(NSFL)](http://i.imgur.com/pdVy7.jpg)"
42779,best detective show,"Never heard of any of these, I will have to check them out thanks!"
25300,best spiderman actor,I'll start the Tobey Maguire fan lines. I prefer his first two movies.
3850,best online college,Yeah it's too bad you fell into that scam.  Best way to recover it is to find an entry lvl job and move your way up the experience pole.
42770,best detective show,I have a movie for you but you might've already seen it. Murder On The Orient Express. Sorry if you've seen it.
5128,best home improvement store,They both seem to source their lumber from the same twisted trees.  Finding a straight board in either seems damn near impossible.
71369,best movies with a cool twist,"Chinatown is my number 1.

Also though; Citizen Kane, Laura, The Third Man, Psycho, Empire Strikes Back, The Terminator, Seven, Oldboy, and The Matrix Reloaded (I know, I know)."
17808,best Kardashian,I agree with everything you said! Kylie is a mystery - she seems to be a good friend but in some instances she doesn’t lol.
42224,movies like Inception,Went into it thinking it was a run of the mill murder thriller. Was elated at what it turned out to be. Awesome movie.
14041,best place to get free books,"What issue are you facing? This is the signup page.

http://audiobookbay.nl/member/users/index?mode=register

You need to ensure you press the grey Torrent download button, the other two are just external sites.

Then once you've done that, it should ask for username & password details and email, and then voila account created. I just did it now so it is working.

Let me know if you still can't fix it and i'll create the account for you."
70442,best major to study in college,"We actually rarely use textbooks because professors     Usually come from the field with experience. Like one of my professors said, you don't need a generic textbook when I can tell you everything you need to know."
9581,best toothpaste,"Please, Mr. Jones is my father. My actual first name is Mister."
