"Hi everyone,

I've been looking into the samsung odyssey G7 series of monitors. However I have some questions regarding this monitor. Since this monitor is not cheap I want to be as thorough as possible. Anyway, far as I can see its has two models produced one being Samsung Odyssey G7 C32G75TQSUX and the other being Samsung Odyssey G7 LC32G75TQSUXEN now the question I have is whats the difference between the C32 model and the LC32 is one better than the other is the other one newer and so on, is there much of a difference between these two and should I pay attention to this. I can imagine the diffrence is that one model is a from a different factory production line however im not sure about this. So if anyone could clarify which these I should get or whats the difference I would apreciate it greatly.

And if anyone else already has this monitor I'd be happy to know whats your experience been with it :)

Thanks everyone"

Reality is often disappointing.
Is this faster than mapping caps lock to escape?
This is reddit. People downvote for the hell of it

Cautiously optimistic about the remake, too.  :)"
The Gargoyle by Andrew Davidson. Not your typical love story especially when you first start  reading it you will think wtf! But seriously worth a read!
My 500e had a broken j1772 connector. Replacement part is $200. Labor is $3000. Skip.
"First off, I am a 34 year old man. When I was in jr high school, I took both shop class, and home ec. For home ec one time, we sewed together sweatshirts with a design of our choosing, from whatever type of catalog we were using at the time. I picked out a pattern that had a design of a cheetah, hanging from a tree limb, and there's a quote that says ""just hangin' around"" on it. I gave it to my father for father's day like, 22 years ago, and I'll still go to his house and see him wearing this fucking old ass ""just hangin' around"" sweatshirt. Cracks me up inside every time I see it."
Lmao... 4min long video for 10 seconds of relevant content. Gotta love YouTube these days.
very good bot
All the best countries are cold.
"I personally don't recommend any. The best thing to use imo is just deodorant. You're fairly close to people and most fragrances can get too offensive and bothersome when you're working out. 

To give ideas of something gym appropriate though I'd say just anything clean, fresh, generic and weak performing. A few that come to mind are Cool Water, Diesel Only The Brave, K EDT or YSL Y EDT"
"If this list is a measure of how good a player has been and is projected to be over the past few Years, then Lamar should be in over Dak. If this list is solely for this year (or the pace they were on for this year since Dak got injured) then Aaron Rodgers shouldn't be the 3rd QB on the list. I know this is a clickbait meme list anyway but I'm still pissed at just how bad this list is."

Dont use metal! A long skinny non-insulator such as a spliced toothpick would be better
This. Not enough games to qualify
Highly recommended!   I'm only in the middle of the trilogy but already know that this is one of the better fantasy series I've come across. The darker the better in my opinion.
"Adam Savage from Mythbusters. I met him at a White House science fair a few years back and got to talk to him for a bit. He was really nice and easy to talk to (and does actually wear the hat out and about). I told him that watching his show with my dad as a kid was part of what made me want to be an engineer and he actually got really excited about that. Just a super cool guy overall. 

Obama and Bill Nye are also very nice"

"A pen/pencil holder I made in second grade. It was a frozen orange juice can with lots of tissue paper applied on it. Over the years, the colors all faded out, but he kept it on his dresser and used it. He died last May and it's still on his dresser."
"Twirl by Kate Spade, unfortunately, it's discontinued :("
"Should be cocoatop64, also why run altstore and reprovision?

Good list though, also milky way 3 is out."
"haha fair enough, legendaries are always great to catch! i think I'll go with Alpha Sapphire and Ultra Sun. thanks for your input!"
"Theres actually not that much choice. You can use a [monitor picker](https://www.productchart.com/monitors/) for that.  
It all  basically boils down to is what kind of panel you want - TN or IPS. You can google if you don't know - there are tons of information about this.  
With G-sync and those parameters that you want there is literally only 3 different TN monitors and 2 IPS (3 on the website but 2 of them are practically the same thing)."
