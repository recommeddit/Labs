54153,best medicine for a cold,Alka-seltzer cold and flu. That stuff is fucking magnificent. I have sinus problems all the time and alka-seltzer fixes them 100%.
33804,best Pokemon game,"Unovas the best because it has a variety of mons and alot of them have good designs and Kanto is the worst, most of the mons are just boring or terrible at battling. I know people's argument against that is it's the first game in the series but I still hate it"

Would almost throw Blue Chips and Blue Chips2 Just cuz I dig Bronson so much (and I know they are mixtapes not albums). Almost was gonna say Mr. Wonderful just for Easy Rider Alone lol.  B4 Da $$ was a solid album. This will def piss off some people, but I respect Kendrick's lyricism but can't get myself to like TPAB as much as everyone else does. I just don't feel the music. I listen to  Good Kid, MAAD City more. But I don't argue too much with new headz who put him up there because he is the man doin it now.  

When I listen to people who shit on Illmatic I just immediately think it's people who are trying too hard to pretend they have a new take on what's Hip Hop. It was a solid album. Not one weak song. Music really is subjective but there only may be a handful of albums that truly do not have a weak song. This one is one of them. Get over it. Or don't...whatever."
5775,best programming language for web development,Don't make it live further.

30130,best Mexican war to study,"This quote by him doesn't get enough circulation: 

""“With a soldier the flag is paramount . . . I know the struggle with my conscience during the Mexican War. I have never altogether forgiven myself for going into that. I had very strong opinions on the subject. I do not think there was ever a more wicked war than that waged by the United States on Mexico. I thought so at the time, when I was a youngster, only I had not moral courage enough to resign. I had taken an oath to serve eight years, unless sooner discharged, and I considered my supreme duty was to my flag. I had a horror of the Mexican War, and I have always believed that it was on our part most unjust. The wickedness was not in the way our soldiers conducted it, but in the conduct of our government in declaring war. The troops behaved well in Mexico, and the government acted handsomely about the peace. We had no claim on Mexico. Texas had no claim beyond the Nueces River, and yet we pushed on to the Rio Grande and crossed it. I am always ashamed of my country when I think of that invasion.”

~ Ulysses S. Grant to journalist John Russell Young (1879), quoted by Young in Around the World with General Grant (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 2002), 376-377"""
