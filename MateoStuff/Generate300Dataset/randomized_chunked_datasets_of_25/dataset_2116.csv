33585,best electric car,"I didn’t think the RAV4 was bad. It’s one of the best ICE crossovers in that price range. It just can’t compete with the ID.4 driving experience IMO which is smoother, quieter and quicker off the line. Plus, the ID.4 has a nicer interior."
4846,best home improvement store,"As an IT contractor I can tell you that Lowes is in a constant struggle to match what HD is doing. As such I tend to only shop at HD. Much like I prefer Mac over HP PC's.

HD seems to have the better leadership and I tend to trust their quality of products. That said HD sells Ryobi products which are complete crap.

I go to Harbor Freight for 1 off tools. I apply the same philosophy to HD vs. Lowes. If I need good product; HD, if I need weather stripping or some stone, Lowes; something they can't mess up."

54610,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hi,

I want to thank you for all the incredibly detailed help you've been providing others, as reading through your comments has been enlightening about Artisan pads I've yet to try. Having a bit of a dilemma in selecting a new one, myself. I currently own a Hien Soft XL. However, I've meandered between different types of pads over the years, and can never find what's ""right"" for me.

Certainly, I'm questioning whether the Hien is the ultimate solution, because it just doesn't click for me the way I wish it did. Had it a little over 3 months, and I'd say it's fairly broken in now, but perhaps I just need to give it more time? For a bit of background, my best flicking aim has been with the QCK Heavy, of which I've owned two. My best tracking has been on a Glorious Helios hard pad, of which I've also owned two. Obviously, these are VASTLY different surfaces, and it's hard to find a truly happy medium. I mostly play Overwatch and Valorant at 800 dpi, with 2.65 and 0.25 sens respectively. I'm generally more accurate in tracking aim training exercises than I am in flicking.

As for my question, which pad(s) do you think provide the best middle ground (if not the Hien Soft) between my favorites among previous pads, given that I lean more towards tracking but want to maintain at least some control for flicking? Should I simply keep trying to use the Hien? I'm definitely not against ordering new pads, and have considered the Raiden in XSoft, or the Otsu V2 in Soft or XSoft. Even pondered whether I should try the Hien in XSoft or Mid. In any case, I appreciate any help, and all the time you've put into assisting the community!"
