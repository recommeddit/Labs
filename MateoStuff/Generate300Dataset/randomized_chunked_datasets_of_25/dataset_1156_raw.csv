"Yeah man, all those 808s and high hats on TPAB  are going to age poorly then Iâ€™ll be eating my remark. Oh wait."
Baking soda is abrasive. Some people use it in the kitchen not just for baking but also as a scouring powder.

"GT sport has no weather, yet. They've been promising for ages. Customization is almost non existent in PC2, set livery selection for every car. GT Sport has fully customizable livery on almost every car. PC2 has a Collector's Edition that has all but one of the DLCs, the extra one is $5, and GT Sport is still popping out more cars almost monthly. PC2 you can do single player races with every car from the get go, no collecting and buying cars. GT Sport has the classic grind for money to buy cars thing from every GT game past"
That thumping sound you hear is the English team that had to play The Invincibles rolling over in their graves simultaneously.
"Yeah i love that guy. I have seen him on ""this is not happening"" cc."
He is trying to increase his commercial value. Loved him in ludo this year. Am excited about White Tiger.....
"Yes, I've heard of it as a Colorado Bulldog, but it takes the White Russian and makes it taste like a Coke Float.  VERY good stuff."
I use gedit

"I will usually find her a bottle of wine, a gift card, or give her a book that I loved. I have also crocheted her things like slippers and scarves."
"Firstly, it's ""too"".

Secondly, that's exactly what I'm talking about."
I think I stopped after the 10th book and I totally agree. I did love Zsadist's chapters though. Any suggestions based on him and Bella?

Happy gaming brother!
Thanks alot for your feedback! I will be sure to check out the links
"We try to make her an indoor cat but it's virtually impossible. We live in an apartment complex with 25 units. It's very small and it's gated, so my kids come and go as they please. My cat is very fast. She will go from one end of the living room to the other once she realizes either one of my kids is going to open the screen door. The fault isn't entirely on them though. Sometimes when I'm coming inside, she positions herself near the door hinge and gets out through a narrow opening. I stick my leg in like I'm gonna kick her (I would never actually kick or hurt my cat, I just kick my leg around to scare her away from the door) and I have thunder thighs, so I need a biggish opening to get my leg in. Sometimes my kids think the door is latched when it's not. 

A long time ago I Googled how to prevent cats from escaping and all the forums were understandably against negative reinforcement, so I would feel bad about squirting with water when she gets near the door. I also read a suggestion that was to greet them in a specific spot in the house when you get home so they would rather go to that spot for attention than leave, but my cat never greets us when we get home. Sometimes she hangs out in the bedroom or bathroom. I'm at a loss with how to make her want to stay inside. Forcing her to stay is seemingly impossible."

"I just wanted to add another thought (it's 1am, so brain is starting to shut down).

Another good reason to create a github account is to become familiar with version control software. A lot of, if not most, companies want you to be familiar with at least one VCS. Lately it's generally either git or TFS (though some places will ask for subversion experience. I've almost never seen anywhere asking for mercurial and CVS is, thankfully, rarely asked for as well)

TFS now has free cloud based accounts for up to 5 users and TFS2013 and cloud support git repositories in addition to the old style TFS repos. If you do dev in the Microsoft ecosystem, it's not a bad idea to get both, honestly.

Keep your public stuff on github and your private stuff in TFS. As an added bonus, TFS also has a lot of ALM stuff baked in. It's not exactly intuitive, but it's not that hard to learn the basics of either (and is another selling point for you since you'd be familiar with bug tracking and agile tools as well)"
So you end up writing a compiler then...
"Not much time . CopyLog and Copypasta did most of the work . What I did is copy description and source for multiple tweaks then add to my list and modify the description to make it look better.  
It all started with saving my tweaks and repos to do restore rootfs."
"Most shit works ""out of the box"" and there is generally no need to install any extensions. Compare that to VSCode: you have to install a shitload of extensions for you to get to work the way you want."
There's more variety here than in the BGG top 100 for what it's worth.

"Good healthcare? 40 hour workweeks? I got two words friend:
government 
job
Ideally a progressive urban municipality. 

I work for a municipality in Utah as such, here is where I stand:

Being close to beautiful nature for hiking, biking, etc.--hell yes. I can get to high alpine afterwork in the summer.

40 hour workweek or less--yes

Equality between genders, and progressive values in general--On a state level, no. county level, yes.

Guaranteed healthcare--Extremely Cheap

Clean cities and public spaces--Cities aren't generally clean but we're next to a lot of national parks

Mild weather, or at least warm Springs and Summers--Definitely warm springs and summers. Cold winters though.

A good economy for both tech fields (my partner's) and social science related things (my interest)--Social science, no. tech fields, yes. Generally though, our economy is great.

The US covers such a large geographic area and the broad political climate addresses each of your criterion by a wide variety in contrast to a small European country. You already speak the language and you're a citizen. It would be substantially easier to attain these goals here because of this. 

Chattanooga Tennessee would likely fulfill many of these as well."
