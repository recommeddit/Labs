"Thought I'd pitch in with my two cents since most people seem to be listing the the best players in each ""role"" in a cricket team, rather than the best test team.

Bear in mind that players before the 1985ish are slightly underrepresented in my team simply because I've never had the chance to appraise them, other than the ones who force their way in on the merit of having a truly freaky set of stats.


1. Sehwag 
2. Sobers
3. Bradman
4. Tendulkar
5. Ponting (Captain)
6. Kallis
7. Sangakkara (WK)
8. Warne
9. Courtney Walsh
10. Muralitharan
11. Shane Bond

Couple of odd selections, but based on what I saw of him Bond was out and out the most destructive bowler I've ever seen bowl, he was hurt by a lot of external stuff in his career IMO. In this team with many bowlers I think it'd be easier to rotate him and not stress his body too much, and just let him focus on bowling lethal bursts.

Sehwag is also not in the top two openers ever for sure, I think. But for the best XI ever, in such a stacked lineup where the top 7 always average over 400 (I'm assuming there are no crazies dropping Don) I'm happy to gamble the 10-20 or so runs on average that he'd fall behind the Greenidges or Wallys of the world for his run a ball smackfests on flat tracks. I've put Kallis and Sanga down the batting order because I want them to utilise both of them as 2 players each, both being comfortably world class at their worse discipline, so I'd rather they not have to bat too long.

I don't think it's worth it to find a better keeper than Sanga because there are so few, and they are likely to lose most of the runs they saved when comparing their batting skill vs sanga anyway, no point in them taking up a spot when Sanga can do two people's work.

I think I'm pretty close , any thoughts?"

"Before I get into it, let me state that I specialize in ion exchange not AC and I took this class several years ago.


A big factor is pore size distribution. A lot of what governs removal is transport within the carbon. If a molecule is too large, it isn't likely to be able to travel in the pores of the carbon, thus is unable to be removed. 

In addition to steric effects, structural properties of the molecules matter and so do the surface functional groups of the carbon.  I'm no  expert on AC, but I do know that carbon tends to make use of Van der Waal's forces and that alcohols tend to not be removed.  If you need/want more info I can look further into it."
That's a pretty broad umbrella. Not every single STEM degree is useful on its own. Biology comes to mind.
