Amelanchier canadensis - white flowers in early summer, edible berries mid-late summer (taste like blueberries, birds love them), excellent red/orange/yellow fall colour."
25042,best spiderman actor,"As someone will surely bring up: the black suit gave Peter a new sense of confidence that led to unwarranted self-importance. This self-importance manifested itself in his cringey, emo interactions in that scene. The movie intentionally made him look like an idiot because he was being one.

Whether or not that's good or not is debatable. But some people didn't think the directors knew how awkward that scene came across. Of course they did. That was the intention."
72127,best movies with a cool twist,"My mate watched it the night before and told me that the twist ending was amazing. Sat down and watched it with him and about 5 minuets before I clocked it, was sat there with my head in my hands just waiting, brilliant film."
51261,best iphone case,"I would say itâ€™s good! Iâ€™ve dropped it several times and havenâ€™t had any issues. Maybe just some scratches to the screen but my phone has so many now that it doesnâ€™t bother me. It also isnâ€™t super grippy, it easily slides out of my hand so that could be something to keep in mind if youâ€™re more clumsy. I would like to get it again but itâ€™s not available on Amazon for me so Iâ€™m thinking of going with the rugged armor for now.

Edit: mine is for the 7 plus, looking at the newer ones it looks like theyâ€™ve added grip to the sides which mine doesnâ€™t have so Iâ€™d imagine it would be a bit better than what I currently have."

15817,best sunglasses for fashion,"If you ever drive a car, get polarized lenses. They will make driving during the day significantly safer as they will greatly reduce glare from the sun and reflections, making it easier to see the road and focus.

Don't even consider non-polarized lenses. They're not worth even the $5."
