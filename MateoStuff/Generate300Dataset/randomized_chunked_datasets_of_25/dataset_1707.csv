1. Coherence.  A darling of the Reddit crowd, and it deserves the love.  A great and cheap little film.

25042,"As someone will surely bring up: the black suit gave Peter a new sense of confidence that led to unwarranted self-importance. This self-importance manifested itself in his cringey, emo interactions in that scene. The movie intentionally made him look like an idiot because he was being one.

Whether or not that's good or not is debatable. But some people didn't think the directors knew how awkward that scene came across. Of course they did. That was the intention.",best spiderman actor

51261,"I would say itâ€™s good! Iâ€™ve dropped it several times and havenâ€™t had any issues. Maybe just some scratches to the screen but my phone has so many now that it doesnâ€™t bother me. It also isnâ€™t super grippy, it easily slides out of my hand so that could be something to keep in mind if youâ€™re more clumsy. I would like to get it again but itâ€™s not available on Amazon for me so Iâ€™m thinking of going with the rugged armor for now.

Edit: mine is for the 7 plus, looking at the newer ones it looks like theyâ€™ve added grip to the sides which mine doesnâ€™t have so Iâ€™d imagine it would be a bit better than what I currently have.",best iphone case
