9608,best dorm hall at UCSB,FT is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. My floor became my family. We are all still incredibly close.
16403,best sunglasses for fashion,"They get way too much shit just because they're owned by Luxottica. At the end of the day all the og styles originated with them (Aviators, Wayfarers, and Clubmasters). That said I would never pay full retail price for them. The pairs I do own have all held up way better than the pairs of Randolphs I own despite their supposed better build quality."
66431,best soccer team in the world,"Could be done, but no reason to. Depay will 100% play as a striker when possible. had around 30 G+A in 30 games since Koeman started using him as a striker and he is crucial to our attacking flow with his movement.

Plus we have a number of young talented strikers behind him (Boadu, Malen, Bergwijn). Personally I also prefer Van de Beek as a midfielder with late rushes into the box, he was always most effective in that position. Which makes his transfer to United so baffling since they have both Pogba and Bruno. shame he barely gets to play, but I completely understand Ole for playing Bruno as often as he can lol"
27245,best stocks to buy,I wished I had put $10k in in 2011.  I'd be sittimg on $260k right now!  I had $10k in my bank in those days making .05% maybe :(
7953,best laptop for general use,AUD so about $1000-1200 USD if I wait til next payday.
29631,best game console,"Ya I actually stopped gaming for long time after my socom 1 and 2 addiction.  never played 3 or 4.

FYI there is a mod for cs:go that puts you in 3rd person view.  Someone remade frostfire, crossroads, and desert glory.  It's worth checking out.

unfinished maps are the ruins and the mixer.

He's releasing more too."
72622,best wireless lightweight mouse,"Lots of comparisons and practical stuff,  was a good read."
66985,best soccer team in the world,I don't think they're better than Pep's Barca.
37474,best amusement park,"But CF still spent most of the 2010s on top. For the most part, this was their decade, and the 2020s will belong to SWP&E."
44286,best items under $100,"I just put a fogless mirror in my shower and now always shave in the shower so I can enjoy the hot water longer. Very glad I started doing this. Bought it for $15 on Amazon.

Also, netflix like someone said.  I have my old laptop connected to my TV and an app on my android to control it remotely."
3632,best college for research,"Assuming you mean UNC chapel hill, why is that surprising? It’s a top 5 public school in the US"
23816,best car racing video game,"The only game I know of that would have it is some crappy Jeep racing game on the Wii that probably shouldn't have existed, and was basically just a terrible advertisement for Jeep. Even that didn't have mine in it though."
73522,best battery bank,"I personally have the [Anker Powecore III elite](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/anker-powercore-iii-elite-26000-mah-87w-usb-c-pd-portable-charger-black/6433261.p?skuId=6433261) as my high capacity battery. It outputs 87w but charges at 100w, allowing me to fully charge it in about an hour with the right charger."
42493,best detective show,"The Departed, one of the greatest movies of all time imo."
4158,best text editor,"I use emacs for everything. I assume there are probably code completion plugins available, but I hate the idea so I've never looked into it.

But after 20 years of using it and trying the hot new editor of the day on a regular basis... Nothing comes close to feeling as right as emacs does out of the box or working as well as it does"
37668,best Marvel movie,"Yeah, especially since Disney+ made me not even have to put a Blu-ray in.  I also watch Deadpool 1 & 2 A LOT.  Funny thing is, I've always been much more into DC comics, but while I enjoy some of the DC films, there's really no comparison."
68200,best science fiction novel,"Neuromancer is complex, but I read it after a friend so I had all these super long conversations where we unpacked it so that is part of the love for me. I found that the more I talked it out the more I loved and appreciated it. The two follow ups are great too, I think it is the second one that has a more straight foward and actiony approach which was great. Also, Molly is a fantastic character. 

The Bridge trilogy is excellent. With each of these three trilogies Gibson brought the time closer to the present and stepped down the technology advancements. The Blue Ant felt a little future focused, Bridge trilogy was like 20ish year projection from now with AI and digital printers, and the Sprawl trilogy was super cyber punk and heavy tech. 

Bridge has a nice balance, would recommend them, especially if you liked the Blue Ant set as they more like those than Neuromancer.

Didn’t know a new Gibson was coming out this year,  very exciting!"

5. Perfect Blue

6. Tatami Galaxy

7. Code Geass

8. FMA 2003

9. Made in abyss

10. GITS (SAC/2nd gig/movie)"
52451,best hiphop album,"Like I agree with people being sheeps that just mindlessly repeat popular opinions but I don't get how Nas a top tier lyricist is comparable to the Game or Lloyd Bank like no hate but not any project of them is remotely close to Illmatic....a young and hungry MC delievers a classic as his debut with 4 top tier producers (Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, Large Professors). That is an avengers endgame level production collab bro."
21099,best workout music,"I don't usually like Kanye, but this song is pretty good."
55596,best action and adventure novel series,"All this, yes. But also Richard, the protagonist, is one of the most infuriatingly uninteresting characters you'll find in any book in any genre. 

I liked Wizard's First Rule. That, I think, was a bit of honest storytelling from Goodkind. But it's all downhill from there, and the hill is slick with Goodkind's sanctimonious bullshit."
