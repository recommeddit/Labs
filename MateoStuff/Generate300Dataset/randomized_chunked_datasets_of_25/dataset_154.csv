16403,"They get way too much shit just because they're owned by Luxottica. At the end of the day all the og styles originated with them (Aviators, Wayfarers, and Clubmasters). That said I would never pay full retail price for them. The pairs I do own have all held up way better than the pairs of Randolphs I own despite their supposed better build quality.",best sunglasses for fashion
66431,"Could be done, but no reason to. Depay will 100% play as a striker when possible. had around 30 G+A in 30 games since Koeman started using him as a striker and he is crucial to our attacking flow with his movement.

Plus we have a number of young talented strikers behind him (Boadu, Malen, Bergwijn). Personally I also prefer Van de Beek as a midfielder with late rushes into the box, he was always most effective in that position. Which makes his transfer to United so baffling since they have both Pogba and Bruno. shame he barely gets to play, but I completely understand Ole for playing Bruno as often as he can lol",best soccer team in the world

68200,"Neuromancer is complex, but I read it after a friend so I had all these super long conversations where we unpacked it so that is part of the love for me. I found that the more I talked it out the more I loved and appreciated it. The two follow ups are great too, I think it is the second one that has a more straight foward and actiony approach which was great. Also, Molly is a fantastic character. 

The Bridge trilogy is excellent. With each of these three trilogies Gibson brought the time closer to the present and stepped down the technology advancements. The Blue Ant felt a little future focused, Bridge trilogy was like 20ish year projection from now with AI and digital printers, and the Sprawl trilogy was super cyber punk and heavy tech. 

Bridge has a nice balance, would recommend them, especially if you liked the Blue Ant set as they more like those than Neuromancer.

Didn’t know a new Gibson was coming out this year,  very exciting!",best science fiction novel
