The pile of shit that was Raise the Titanic(oh hell ya there was another Cussler movie)made Cussler swear he'd never do it again. He eventually let them do Sahara because of some script control and we all know how that turned out. It was a decent flick but it sure as hell wasn't a Dirk Pitt adventure. I believe it's safe to say no more Pitt until Cussler is dead and even then probably not.
Interesting my 11 silicon case wasn’t. Thanks!

"Holy shit man, you think scripts are required to install malware from a website? How did malware pass via websites before CSS?
Please stop talking to me about this. It's fucking insane to have to argue with people about whether or not HTML and CSS can vector malware."

"I didn't want to lose any desk space to the footprint of the lamp, but still wanted a high quality adjustable lamp.  This one is a bit expensive, but it's been fantastic.  LED, you can adjust the color temperature and brightness easily.

I know these are all subjective preferences, but I really couldn’t disagree more with this aggregation. I’m kind of baffled how terrible I think this list is."
That's certainly something.

"I would argue that AC Odyssey is more of an RPG than AC Origins though. Odyssey has different dialog options, lots of upgradable loot, skill trees, optional side quests and you can totally finish missions in different ways. I agree it's all very light, but in that way it's not that different from the Witcher which Ubisoft clearly tries to mimic with the new AC games."
"If it turns out that 2 10000 mah power banks (or multiples of lower mah) weigh less than 1 at 20000, it might be worth a shot to go this route."
Biggly second this.
"Kendrick Lamar has 2 albums on the list, DJ Shadow made it, fucking sloppy seconds Kanye is on there, yet there is not any Blueprint, any Me Against The World, any Ready To Die, any MM FOOD. Fuck this bullshit, and fuck the World for forgetting true Hip Hop and getting into the bullshit of those cunts who changed the culture into RAP."
