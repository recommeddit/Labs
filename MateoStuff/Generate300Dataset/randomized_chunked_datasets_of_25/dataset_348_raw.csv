"Thanks, do the games run well, i read that the PS4 just like i with the PS3 could experience some FPS drops here and there, how is this on the switch?"
"Home Depot 3 years ago, custom sized 2"" faux wood blinds that are cordless.  They were stupid cheap.  Like 10 windows were less than $500."
Money Heist (Ive only seen one or two episodes but all the reviews point to it warranting inclusion here)
"If you're going at the secondary level, don't major in education. Major in the subject matter you want to teach, and then apply to teaching school. Or better yet, apply to a school that combines these two. For example, my undergrad has a 5-year program where you get your bachelor's degree in your chosen subject area (such as English), as well as a teaching certificate, and spend a year student-teaching in an actual classroom. Also, I'd look to other subject areas - it will be very difficult to find a teaching job in those two subjects you mentioned, they are in very low demand."
Try checking groupon. We got an incredible all inclusive room in Cancun for $90 a night.
"You can also try to email the author. I have publications, if you email me I'd send you the paper."
"Tons of teachers in my district did something totally different and then switched to education for their masters, and I went to one of the best public school districts in the state. My chem teacher worked construction, my algebra teacher did business, and my father who works in the district as an elementary school teacher did accounting. I think they actually prefer teachers who did something different before, most students are not going to become teachers and having an adult that also went down that life path before switching is helpful."
"Depends on the generation. Within each generation, the versions ar epretty much the exact same game, but each version has its own Pokémon that can only be obtained in that game and not the others without resorting to trading with other people."
United 5th.  Why exactly r/soccer?
Honestly oatmeal. The big container can be had for $2-4 depending on brand and it will last a long time (a month?) even having it everyday.
It doesn't appear to be working anymore. Did they update their site?

Since when are Butterfingers good candy?
Thanks!  I didn't know these sites existed or how to link things. Appreciate the information!
How is your data speed? It doesnt explicitly state what its data speeds are.
">It can be a bit misleading to look simply at the population of the country to determine their potential pool of players, for that reason.

Croatian diaspora is 1 million at best. So instead of 4.5 million there's 5.5 million to look at. Still less than 10% of the populations of Germany, England or France. Hardly misleading."
Have you considered getting rid of all ads and monetize your audience differently?
"You convinced me. I was eying Mobile for the longest time, but just wasn’t turned on by the severe drop in features vs the PC version. I honestly had _no_ idea FM Touch was even on the iPad. I always thought Touch equaled Mobile. I just bought it. Thanks for the response! :)"

"Did you happen to pick up any XML while you were learning Java? If so, learning HTML should be a breeze. From there, CSS and JS are good to know regardless if you want to do front end or back end. If you want to focus on back end, play around with PHP and then maybe install a framework like Laravel, or Ruby and then RoR."
"Nothing is ‘wrong’ with continuing to use it currently. It’s now unmaintained though, so any changes to Node that break it, or any discovered vulnerabilities will never be fixed. Thinking about where to move is more of a long-term thought process - it’s not going to break overnight. 

There are also quite a lot of outstanding bugs with request that will now never get fixed. These may not impact your use-case, but they’re good to keep in mind."

Fitz maybe could've pulled it off with better QBs throughout his career. Rice had a massive 64% of his passes thrown from HoF QBs. Fitzgerald had less than 4% of his passes thrown from HoF QBs.
Works on android as well btw
