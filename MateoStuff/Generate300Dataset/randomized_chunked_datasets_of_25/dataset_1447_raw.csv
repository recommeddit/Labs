"Your point was very explicitly that I was probably trying to palm it like an idiot, and my point was that it's just too small for my hand."
"None of that has anything to do with the products they offer.  I'm sorry you had a bad employment experience there, but that doesn't answer the question asked in any way.

To OP: I find that Home Depot has a better selection.  In my experience, prices between the two are basically equal, so you're going going to save much by choosing one over the other.  I would just go with the one that carries more of what I'm looking for."
Lol I genuinely donâ€™t think she would even know how to have a engaging conversation with a fan even if she tried
So Top 10 *most overrated* hip-hop albums of all time
"Interesting that you mention Freddie Gibbs - Shadow of a Doubt.

Im a BIG Gibbs fan, but i still cant get completely into that album. I fuck more with ESGN and Pinata"
Or fucking pennies.
Rum works too.
"Azzaro Visit. I had previously mentioned in a few comments my love for Gucci Rush. After it was discontinued, this was the closest thing to it. I also recently picked picked up Eau de Rochas after researching good citrus frags. Apparently it was big in the early 90s. It's really solid and I'm digging it a lot right now"

I mean we know Tom hardy will be great in it. Because Tom Hardy is always great.

"I've seen this comment posted word for word repeatedly and I never understand it. I thought it was a great film and have watched it multiple times as I think the characters, cinematography and soundtrack were excellent"
"I think it's ridiculous that Peterson gets both AD and AP. He has an earlier claim but if he's going to go by a two letter moniker I think it has to be AP.

And while we're on the subject, I'd just like to say that I'm not okay with Jonathan Taylor being referred to as JT, when he's not even the most accomplished JT in the NFL. If anyone is going to steal JT away from Justin Timberlake, it's Justin Tucker."
"Mentadent.  

Sweet-ass dispenser."
"It's not always just about the major, but what else you do in school. I got my degree in anthropology, which as a bachelor's doesn't mean much in itself, but I managed to get into courses where I did actual research and got my name co-published in a couple professional journals. That was something I've been able to market to employers as much if not more than the degree.

Same goes for something often bad mouthed like women's studies. I have two close friends who went that route, and both are employed in careers. Women's studies, not STEM, prepared them to go on to get social work degrees, which is where they now make their living."
Thats how you know they're ripe!
I just got it. It's beautiful
"I've had a wonderful experience with Manjaro. I was a long time Linux Mint user and migrated over to Manjaro and honestly never looked back. Everything works perfectly, AUR has almost everything anyone would need.  I got steam, retroarch, lutris working perfectly. Only downside I found was the office apps. They are not the best but they get the job done."
I went on a trip to Akumal on the Yucatan peninsula a few years ago. There were quite a few of us but we rented a large house that came with it's own cleaning lady/cook who was absolutely fantastic. I don't remember how much it was but in that neighborhood there were various sized houses (mostly all privately owned and for rent as vacation spots). We were right on the ocean and could just walk out the back door and go snorkeling. It was great!
"Some of those songs I could agree with, but for a lot of them my workout would be in running away from the speakers until I couldn't hear them any more."
"Gently place a chicken on your shoulder. With this, yodle loudly for as long as your breath can last. Then skip in a circle. Make sure someone is watching. Rinse and repeat."

That's what I get for copy-pasting the comment
"I'm looking for a laptop with 10+ battery life. I am a college student and for once, I want a genuinely good laptop that is reliable, convenient, and solid for its price and ideally with an i7 core processor. The most important aspect aspect to me is the battery life with the 2nd being its longevity. I'm willing to spend 1,500. Please advise. Also, are macbooks worth all the hype? I was considering one but I'm not sure if I'd enjoy using it as much as Windows. I been told ease of use with Macbooks is difficult in comparison to that of Windows."
