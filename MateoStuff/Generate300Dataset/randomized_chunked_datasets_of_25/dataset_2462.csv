65064,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"I haven't been to FP in years, they are probably better now after the rebranding, used to get a lot of snarky boys who thought they had the best coffee ever.

I haven't been to the Caje on Hayley, I think that place was supposed to be the new place, he was saying they were going to do coffee in the day and cocktails at night, but those licenses are hard to get I know. Still a good idea!

I'm excited about Low Pigeon, an old acquaintance is roasting there so that gives me hope. SB needs more places like that, not pseudo fancy eateries everywhere. It's already hard enough to pay too much for rent, people have to have affordable and good places to go so they can enjoy the city too."
29606,best game console,Yeah. Though for it's a first round pick because I can't get that sort of experience at all on the PC. There are similar games to God of War on the PC. There are better FPS games. there are just as many platformers as there are on the consoles. WWE is the only game that doesn't have a real replacement on the PC.

25940,best cricket teams of all time,"Ah, I wasn't aware of that, sorry. I assumed it was generally the nickname of the Aussie team of the 40s."
16598,best pet for toddlers,We have corn snakes. They are pretty cool
19562,best YouTube video,"Fun story I love to tell about this one:

The first time I showed this to my dad (who LOVES HP), he was mildly amused. A few hours later, I heard him cleaning the kitchen and quietly singing ""Snape, Snape, Severus Snape..."" as he worked. Turned out it was catchier than he'd realized."
25519,best cricket teams of all time,I reckon you should drop a cousin or two for muriltharin and jayawardena
58755,best cologne,"You are 100% wrong. Virtually every fragrance community on reddit or otherwise involves owning multiple if not dozens of fragrances that you wear for different times. Limiting yourself to a signature scent is ignorant at best. 

There is literally no way a fragrance for a club is one that is ideal for eating dinner at a nice restaurant or going on a road trip.

HoM Blackbird is something that I wouldn't probably wear at a meeting, unless I wanted to offend people. TF Tuscan Leather is not particularly good for a nice day at a beach in the Galapagos. 


The idea of having one core fragrance is fine and is good, but saying ""it is looked down upon by enthusiasts"" to wear fragrance as an accessory demonstrates that you are about as far from an enthusiast as it gets.

So yea, have your signature sent, but not mixing it up is for people who can only afford a single bottle and want to get the most use out of it, not people that like fragrance."
29688,best game console,"The Yakuza games need to be on there, IMO.  I love that shit."
41551,best instrument to play,At the same time?
26891,best board games,"I don't know what your group finds exciting but I'm guessing they want player interaction?

Brass has tons of player interaction in that what you do on the board really affects other players.  The spaces are very limited and the rail/canal links and coal/iron/ports built by one player can be used by all, as well as all players affecting the demand tracks/distant market.  This is basically what makes the game so heavy and long since any action you take could easily be a better move for your opponent and the strategic landscape is likely to have changed by the time the turns get back to you.

There's no pew-pew take that, and the game itself moves slowly with all players likely lost in thought (we adopted a rule that you have to tap on the next player's shoulder when done since we were spending too much time with someone not knowing it's their turn lol).  If that sounds exciting to your group then you'll love it, if not then I can definitely understand because it's not for everyone."
19204,best YouTube video,I'm sure this will be mildly interesting to someone: the guy in the suit is the ex-boyfriend of a friend of a friend. Friend-of-a-friend's new boyfriend hates this video with a passion.
16465,best sunglasses for fashion,Which?
9649,best dorm hall at UCSB,Is it a bad idea to take a longboard instead of a bike? Especially if I wind up living in San Cat?
23347,best car racing video game,"BeamNG.drive is fun to mess around in. DiRT Rally and DiRT 4 (haven't played 4,but they're similar, apparently) are great fun for rallying fans. For general racing, Assetto Corsa and rFactor are my favourites. For something more simcade-ish, Grid Autosport was fun. The Crew is nice if you want to roadtrip with your friends, too. 

And if you're willing to mess with some (many) crashes and conflicting mods, Street Legal Racing Redline is awesome. Building your own car from individual parts is great. And it's got loads of mods. 
A less crash-prone alternative is My Summer Car, which is a rural Finland simulator."

60571,Best comedy show on Netflix,Iâ€™ve been watching Sister Sister on Netflix and itâ€™s sooo funny! Lisa Landry is hilarious ðŸ˜‚
61898,Best RPG game on PS4,"My top 5 tend to slant pretty heavily into the JRPG realm so they may not be for everyone. They are:

1. Tales of Berseria
2. Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth
3. Megadimension Neptunia V-II
4. Valkyria Chronicles
5. Disgaea 5

While I would consider Nier:A and H:ZD my two GOTY for 2017 I don't consider either of them to be RPGs in the traditional sense and see them more as action games with RPG elements like the older Zelda or Metroid games. 

I will also begrudgingly recommend Persona 5 or Witcher 3 as you may enjoy them since they are pretty popular games and well received by the community. I just could not get into the Witcher series but respect what CDP has accomplished. 

As for P5, since you're new to RPG's and have most likely never played anything from the SMT line you shoud love it. For me, I find the game to be  a stretched chore with some major pacing issues and shallow characters. Despite my complaints with P5 it is still a very stylized game with some solid music and fun elements that will leave you wanting more from the SMT family."
