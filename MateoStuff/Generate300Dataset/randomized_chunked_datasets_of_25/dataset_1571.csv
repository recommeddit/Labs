28871,"That makes sense for your lifestyle. I run tours by foot through the city I live in, if I don't eat at least something small every few hours it makes my job hard as I feel weak and can't focus on what I am saying, big problem when you have 30 strangers listening to you. If I'm at home a glass of milk can sometimes do the job between meals, but it's been annoying convincing people that I am not just greedy but it'll make me light-headed, shaky and grumpy (I'm not overweight, people still start by asking why I need to eat when we ate a few hours ago).",best breakfast foods

71473,"I was honestly laughing at the cheekiness of those last 10 minutes, and how much of a non-sequitur it felt like after an hour and a half of unbelievable slow burn.

Having seen Cloverfield, I figured they'd do something like that to tie this movie in a little bit, but I didn't expect that intensity.  It was an out-there choice and I don't fault anyone for not liking it because it doesn't mesh with the film as a whole at all, but I loved it.",best movies with a cool twist
45254,"You should try a Switch! They're a little cheaper than an Xbox or Playstation, have a good selection of games to get you started, are pretty intuitive, and with you being busy, you can take it with you when you're on the go. Stuck in line at the post office? Get your Switch out.

Seriously, though, Nintendo has a lot of integrity, which is hard to find these days. I've never bought a Nintendo game that was a disaster like Fallout 76, Battlefront 2, Anthem, etc. They try their best to make sure their games are as good as possible.",best gaming system
