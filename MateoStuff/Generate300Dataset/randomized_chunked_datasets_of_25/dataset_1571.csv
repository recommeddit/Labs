28871,best breakfast foods,"That makes sense for your lifestyle. I run tours by foot through the city I live in, if I don't eat at least something small every few hours it makes my job hard as I feel weak and can't focus on what I am saying, big problem when you have 30 strangers listening to you. If I'm at home a glass of milk can sometimes do the job between meals, but it's been annoying convincing people that I am not just greedy but it'll make me light-headed, shaky and grumpy (I'm not overweight, people still start by asking why I need to eat when we ate a few hours ago)."
27853,best breakfast foods,"Strawberry and Nutella crepe with hash browns and bacon on the side. My mom used to make this for me once a week when I was in high school.

Damn I miss home."
7833,best laptop for general use,What do you plan on using your laptop for?
28626,best breakfast foods,"Yea, but make sure you get a good brand.

I tried to make my own once and just ended up with yeasty discs of misery."
47837,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Another benefit of a TI89 is that you can find AAA batteries pretty easily if you ever need it for a test. My gf had an nspire and it was way too much work to do basic things and you had to remember to occasionally charge it. 

That said, the nspire is stupid fast compared to the Ti89 for more complex calc functions."
15653,best sunglasses for fashion,"While styles are limited, I have the smaller version of what you linked and LOVE THEM. The quality of these is as good if not better than my Ray\-Ban caravans that are almost twice the price without polarized lenses."
66822,best soccer team in the world,Pep Guardiola to England here we go confirmed
71035,best movies with a cool twist,The Sixth Sense and Shutter Island are great.  A lot of people have said Oldboy so that might have to be the next one I watch.
10545,best suitcase lock,A gun by the bed helps you feel safe when the dishes settle in the middle of the night.
58548,best cologne,I love Ultraviolet by Paco Rabanne on a guy.
71473,best movies with a cool twist,"I was honestly laughing at the cheekiness of those last 10 minutes, and how much of a non-sequitur it felt like after an hour and a half of unbelievable slow burn.

Having seen Cloverfield, I figured they'd do something like that to tie this movie in a little bit, but I didn't expect that intensity.  It was an out-there choice and I don't fault anyone for not liking it because it doesn't mesh with the film as a whole at all, but I loved it."
45254,best gaming system,"You should try a Switch! They're a little cheaper than an Xbox or Playstation, have a good selection of games to get you started, are pretty intuitive, and with you being busy, you can take it with you when you're on the go. Stuck in line at the post office? Get your Switch out.

Seriously, though, Nintendo has a lot of integrity, which is hard to find these days. I've never bought a Nintendo game that was a disaster like Fallout 76, Battlefront 2, Anthem, etc. They try their best to make sure their games are as good as possible."
39737,best Chrome extensions,My old boss would put trackers in his emails and then use that knowledge against you if you said you hadn't looked at it yet. He was a little micromanaging shitbag.
19143,best YouTube video,"Old man with the funniest laugh disrupts comedy show. This can cure anything.

71990,best movies with a cool twist,"Hot Fuzz. The amount of set up is astounding, and the more times I watch it the more I realize they blatantly throw clues in your face.

31648,best hotel to live in,Hilton expires after one year of no activity. Are you planning on trying to use them all after work is done? Are you keeping a residence somewhere? Are you saving tons of money doing this?
58848,best cologne,"I don't know why you're being downvoted. This cologne is killer.

Silly people..."
20462,best workout music,"I swap between Old School Hip Hop, Metal, throw in some Sabaton or Rammstein every now and again, some electric stuff but I'm not sure on the differences between house/club or whatever."
54005,best medicine for a cold,"That's confirmation bias. ""I feel a cold coming on"" = onset of cold. Vitamin C only works if you don't have the virus in your system yet."
32245,best hotel to live in,"Well, at least he died with the music off."
12007,best gifts for dad,"He's not a creep, only the oldest one."
