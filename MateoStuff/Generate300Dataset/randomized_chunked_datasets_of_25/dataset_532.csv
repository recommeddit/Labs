47140,best state to visit in the United States,That sounds great though! I would love to do all those things. How are you getting from New York to San Francisco? Alcatraz would be great to see. How much did this cost you if you don't mind me asking?

21543,best winnie the pooh comic,I literally didn't get invited to one of my birthday parties.  My friends made a cake and sang happy birthday and everything but neglected to invite me to the actual show.  It was a good year.
23157,best social networking site for CS,"K, well, then, it's gonna be a bit tricky to market yourself if you don't want to market anything about yourself."

FTFY"
69976,best major to study in college,"Finally my time to shine! I would say doing an undergrad in pure engineering, then master's in BME definitely benefited me since it is such a vast field and you certainly need the technical background as well as a solid specialization.

Pros:

* A fascinating time to be in this field if it's something you're interested in
* Fast growing industry, therefore many well paying job opportunities
* You get to have an education in engineering AND health sciences which is awesome
* Sometimes you get to wear a lab coat

Cons:

* You can't be squeamish since you'll be cutting up dead people alongside other med students
* You'd potentially need to study longer than other fields"
17920,best Kardashian,Really? Good to know
46230,best trick or treating candy,"It's not that people don't like lollipops, hell I love a good one now and then, it's just that dum dum pops are the lowest common denominator of lollipops.  They're small, and they're cheap, and they're just not very good either.

Ah!  Dum Dums are the McDonalds of candy.  There.  I think that works as an analogy."
40738,best instrument to play,Hahaha now this is even better!
48542,best color to paint with,"Honestly? White is good. If you add a good amount of black trim where the walls connect to the ceiling, cabinets above your stove, and a lot of lighting to light up your counters, I think you'd have a pretty great looking kitchen."
28857,best breakfast foods,"Smoothies are generally very high in sugar due to the fruit juice, fruit and added sugar in yogurt - I’d be wary of that."

7299,best iPhone,"Believe it or not, I’m using an iPhone 5s and waiting for my XR delivery. I’ve bot this one in 2016, and it still works really good (the problems are just update releases and the battery), but it works just fine. I believe the XR will perfectly last 4 or more years."
55758,best action and adventure novel series,"Are you willing to look at some light science fiction? There are some really fun planet-hopping adventures that would fit what you're looking for. I'm thinking Simon Green's Deathstalker Series and Karl Schroeder's Virga books.

Fantasy, Wheel of Time is the obvious recommendation. 

If you like enchanted objects, please check out Lawrence Watt-Evans Ethshar books."
