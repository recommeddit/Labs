69976,"Finally my time to shine! I would say doing an undergrad in pure engineering, then master's in BME definitely benefited me since it is such a vast field and you certainly need the technical background as well as a solid specialization.

Pros:

* A fascinating time to be in this field if it's something you're interested in
* Fast growing industry, therefore many well paying job opportunities
* You get to have an education in engineering AND health sciences which is awesome
* Sometimes you get to wear a lab coat

Cons:

* You can't be squeamish since you'll be cutting up dead people alongside other med students
* You'd potentially need to study longer than other fields",best major to study in college
