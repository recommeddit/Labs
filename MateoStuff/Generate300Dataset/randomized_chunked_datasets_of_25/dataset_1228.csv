68583,"Blindsight is amazing. My favorite sci-fi book, the one I think is better than any I've read, is Dark Intelligence. But there is no ""essential"" sci-fi. There's just books you like reading. 

Like, I think Dune is absolute garbage. I really do believe it's a poorly written book with a stupid story. But for some reason, by stating that, I have now pissed off a ridiculous number of sci-fi lovers who claim I must read and enjoy certain essentials or there is no point in reading sci-fi. 

There are no essential books to read. Shit, classics or so-called ""essentials"" are classics/essentials because of lack of competition at the time. Not because they have better stories or are better written than books published recently",best science fiction novel
6634,"I just bought a new to me iPhone X and am very happy with it! I was upgrading from a 6s. I find that iPhones are actually very robust and will last and last. I only replaced because the 6s was going to no longer be supported in this coming year. 
My husband has an SE and is wishing to get a similar small phone but is going to wait a year or so for them to be less new/desirable. There a lots of reputable resellers on eBay and I can send you the seller I like if you send me a DM. They have a great exchange policy and good reviews. I sent back one phone because the charging port seemed a little worn out and they replaced it right away.",best iPhone

I'm trying to get a laptop for my parents that will last. They only want to video call, watch videos and do emails. Is this laptop a good deal? I heard ASUS laptops will fall apart in a couple of years, but I can't find anything else at this price for these specs.

63812,"I'd offer this, Once you make your green tea, go on a walk while you drink your tea. This is the first thing you do in the day. 

The sleep thing can be a lot of things, but this is a good set of rules that will help. 

**Only be in your bed when you are ready to sleep.** (Don't lay in it during the day or while you watch shows.) When we do this, we are teaching the brain that our bed is not for sleeping in. If you only get in bed when you are ready to sleep, you teach your brain to start revving down when you get in bed. 

**Don't look at any screens the last hour of sleep.** The blue wavelength of our screens impairs your brains natural production of hormones that tell you its time to sleep. Brush your teeth, clean, prepare for the next day, whatever you do at night. No screens. 

**Try to sleep in complete darkness and have no sound other then white noise like a fan or humidifier.** Our brains stay aware while we sleep. Studies show that even a blinking red light from a device can affect REM sleep.
