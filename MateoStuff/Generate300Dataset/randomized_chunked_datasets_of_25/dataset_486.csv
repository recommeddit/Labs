49077,best gaming monitor,I have the asus tuf vg27aq. If the 165hz overclock and IPS is a big deal to you then I would opt in for this monitor. if you’re strictly looking for just a 144hz 1440p monitor then the dell s2719 is a great option.

Things you don't have an issue with in a phone who's databus is on board and local storage stream is faster."

26641,best board games,"So there are tons of great suggestions here, but I'm gana suggest something a bit different.

I'm gana suggest you pick up Tabletop Simulator. It's piece of software, runs on Windows or Mac, and has an MSRP of 20 bucks (but is currently 9 bucks over on humblebundle.com and is often on sale for roughly 50% off).

Basically, the software is just a good, well made physics simulator that allows you to import boards, cards, dice, pieces, etc. And a TON of retail games are available for 100% free on the Steam Workshop.

Basically, my recommendation is to pick it up and browse the Workshop for things that look interesting. Download them (the individual games are tiny downloads), load them up, maybe glance over a rulebook (which you MAY have to find a PDF online for), and find a couple that sound interesting. Then, hop into one of the various Tabletop Simulator Steam groups (you can just do a quick search and find tons), and grab some games.

It's a FANTASTIC way to ""try before you buy"" or to find things you'd otherwise never look twice at or even know exist. The software itself is REALLY easy to use (click and drag to move stuffa round, hotkeys for shuffle/cut/deal/roll/etc as well as a right click context menu for all that stuff too) and looks great. And it's cheap enough where if your real life friends want to grab a copy so you can all ""try before you buy"" together, you can easily do it without breaking the bank! The game is even often sold in a four pack.

So yeah, that's my recommendation. Hope you find some awesome games!"

20019,best workout music,"I've always looked at lists like this and I honestly don't think specific lists of songs can determine the best workout songs. 

Personally, I wouldn't listen to any of those songs for my workouts. It depends on my mood and mentality on the day. Sometimes I play metal from my favourite band, other times its dubstep and sometimes its rap.

Don't think Another One Bites The Dust or Smoke on the Water would really pump me up for a soccer game."
