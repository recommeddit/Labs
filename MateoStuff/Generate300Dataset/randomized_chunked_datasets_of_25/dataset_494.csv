5762,"Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS are all really good and useful to know for web dev. That's all I knew prior to being hired for a web developer just a week ago. Here are the few major things that I've been learning the past week (I don't think most people get as lucky as I did given that I knew so little about more back-end stuff):

Learn how to use some sort of database: I've been using MongoDB, but another popular one would be MySQL. If you already know python, it might be easiest to learn PyMongo, although there aren't a lot of good tutorials on that. Maybe just learn MySQL? The database is basically learning how to store, find, manipulate info that's stored server-side.

Learn how to use terminal/command-line: Just simple commands like change directory (cd), ls, grep, etc. This sort of stuff you can really learn by googling the instructions for when you need to run files/a database locally on your computer.

Make a github account: GitHub is used for tracking changes to files and sharing them with others. You don't really need to learn how to use the terminal with git although a lot of people do. The application that you download from github.com makes pushing/pulling really simple, and makes tracking changes easy.

You might also have to use other frameworks at your job, but so many get used by different places that I wouldn't suggest learning any in particular, although the more you learn the easier it will be to pick up new ones, and the better it looks to places hiring. For example, I had to learn Flask, which allows you to use python code in html, for easy transferring of data from a database to html. Although Flask also doesn't have a lot of online tutorials.

But most importantly being able to google things efficiently is the best tool. Knowing what questions to ask and being able to understand explanations is your best asset. I didn't know shit a week ago, but I've gotten better and better at reading and understanding questions people ask/answer on stack overflow and learning how to use that for my own work. If you have a question , most likely someone has asked that question before. Most of the answers are already on the internet (StackOverflow mostly). You just need to figure out how to find and interpret them. Good Luck!",best programming language for web development

For some soft easy reading, I pick up Debbie Macomber or anything really. Id choose her if you are modest, but still like a touch of pda. 

I read a ton of romance! It's my go to genre really.

16775,"I grew up with a Sheltie who was the perfect choice for our family. The dog had no prey drive. He hated strangers, but was bonded to our family and never showed the slightest aggression or irritation with any child. And my parents had five kids, so he was around babies and kids of all ages.

That being said, me and my siblings (probably due to our parents guidance) were calm and gentle with all animals of all species, and never interacted inappropriately with any of them.

67997,"> Seveneves is also a recent. I think Snow Crash or Cryptonomicon would be better representatives.

I think I'd lean more toward *Cryptonomicon* than *Snow Crash*, as I think one needs to be familiar with the cyberpunk tropes Stephenson is satirizing to fully enjoy it. Plus, it has the flaws that one would expect in an early novel by a now-established author, like the amateurish 50-page infodump on Sumeria that grinds everything to a halt in the middle of the book.

ETA: Also, I wish these lists would stop ignoring the New Wave almost completely. A lot of stuff from then might not have aged the best, but there are still a lot of gems and it was incredibly influential in SF overall; yet, for some reason, these lists tend to jump from pulp classics and ""proto"" SF (e.g., Verne and Wells) straight to modern stuff while ignoring epoch-defining works like *Dangerous Visions*.",best science fiction novel
