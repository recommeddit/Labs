Anker 10000 PD because I need power delivery to charge my camera. They make a 20000 version too but I think it's too big.
*ghey
is your girlfriend a guy?
"On mine it seems the light comes on very fast, but I usually just ignore it for a while. I probably replace the filter about as often as OP. Never had a problem, the water always tastes great and fresh even after the light has been red for a while."
I like 1 EPL goal this season
"probably a ti-84, I also took Calc AB and BC in high school and colleges are not gonna teach you how to use functions on your calculator, I used a ti-89 for those two years in high school so use the one you've been using forever and get the same exact model for the ti-84"
"I drink some orange juice and work out. I try to trick my body into feeling like everything is okay and I'm actually perfectly healthy. 

I realize that this mind-set is probably just a placebo, but I haven't had a cold past the point of early symptoms in years."
i use pcmanfm I like it alot.
"No it was just like one of those things that looked like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna hand you your phone peasant here‚Äù and dropped it, like half turning around. I can‚Äôt find the video and I‚Äôm mad bc I remember it so well lol"
"made in a bucket-sized batch just like grandma used to make. 

i miss that rowdy old broad. she knew how to fuckin' party."
One of the best drop zones with views of the pacific and mountains best is near Santa Barbara. Worth the drive.
I really hate how right you are about this...
"Vera Wang Princess.

I used to wear it all the time in high school. Took it out of retirement lately as I had a fresh bottle in my drawer and once again, lots of compliments.

Which makes me sad bc my expensive ones don‚Äôt get noticed often üòÇ"

"1000 universities is way too broad, should have been limited to 100, no more than 200. No way Rank #999 can compare in quality to the top 100 or 200"
"I think I might try Supershieldz. 

Have you used TechArmor‚Äôs before? If so, how does the grain compare?"
My opinion is it‚Äôs way better. We‚Äôve had one for about 3-4 months now and I love it.  Feels like it‚Äôs removing plaque as well.  You do get a shit ton of water all over till you get good at using it.  I usually put in warm water cause it feels better on my teeth
"Off threadish but w/e

My buddy's cousins live in Swan Valley, Idaho. They were at a little gas station, picking up some odds and ends, when somebody drives up on a motorbike, and walks into the store with his black helmet on and visor down. He grabs a candy bar, a few other little things, and goes to pay. The cashier starts ringing him up, and in an effort to make small talk, and figure out who the guy was, says in a cordial tone,
""Who are we today? Darth Vader?""

""Nope,"" the man said, flipping his visor up. ""Han Solo,"" said Harrison Ford."
"If you're a fan of fantasy, then the Kushiel series by Jacqueline Carey is hands down the best. Amazing world building and an epic romance. I give these a read every few years. First book is Kushiel's Dart."

"I have you tagged as ""Doesn't read usernames."""
"Memento - The Christopher Nolan movie that put him on the map.

The Prestige - Inception and The Dark Knight are probably better movies, but this is definitely Nolan‚Äôs most mind-bending film for me. Jackman and Bale kill it. Will reel you in from moment one.

Fight Club - My 2nd favorite movie of all time. Very weird and perplexing. Whatever people‚Äôs thoughts are on Tyler Durden‚Äôs philosophy, there‚Äôs no denying that it‚Äôs super interesting. It has one of the best last 20 minutes of all time.

The Sixth Sense - A great psychological thriller with a dash of horror, if you for some reason haven‚Äôt gotten this movie spoiled or don‚Äôt know anything about it, watch it ASAP."
