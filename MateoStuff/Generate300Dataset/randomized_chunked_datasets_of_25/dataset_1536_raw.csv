Don't for-profits usually cost a whole lot more though?
"People feel like it was overrated by the critics, which is fair, then the backlash was so strong that it became underrated by the fans.

The BP Paradox: If the popular opinion is that something is overrated, is it still overrated?"
"**Bridge of Birds** by Barry Hughart perhaps? It's pretty much an adventure story inspired by Chinese mythology, and a very light read."
"Down from the heavens, decended Chuck Norris"
"Met Alton Brown at a book signing, one of the cooler celebrities I've met."
Thank you so much I’m so excited I’ve been wanting to go for years! Unfortunately I only get one day in the park because I couldent find a sitter for my dog :(
Nothing is nowhere
My rightness is a course sometimes
So ummm I read this with their voices in my head and it makes it very light hearted imo believe it or not
Sounds like either a battery shorted or the lithium batteries had their wrap penetrated. Neither are necessarily the fault of anker
Aj brown is a better receiver than DK though
"Eyeballing and cutting vs. just lifting it out the pan. Also, if pies of any sort that have less than solid interiors easily fall apart. Also, nothing to do with counting calories."
I agree.  Great movie.
"LPT: Use cable ties to guarantee you know that the item stolen from your bag was, in fact, stolen from your bag, but you still have no idea by whom."
I like literally every candy on here except the Old Timer black and orange taffy.
"Def going to save this list. Thanks for the hard work. I only watch English dub, so I figure some of these might be taken off my personal list. Do you have any recommendations? I am about to finish the overly cautious hero"
I once saw William Gibson speak and he said the Stars My Destination was his favorite sci-fi novel. I'm inclined to agree or least have it in my personal top ten.

"I've made this mistake. Built my custom Desktop in Fall 2011, slapped a 60GB SSD as a last minute addition to the budget (~$1,000 originally) just to place the OS on. Everything was fine for awhile, but it just fits enough that each time I have an update that goes directly to [C:] with no way to specify my 2TB [E:] as the download location, I get all kinds of warnings about low disk space.

Little before Christmas I bought [PNY Optima SSD7SC240GOPT-RB 2.5"" 240GB SATA III Synchronous-Mode Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)] off Newegg and for Christmas received a second one. Now I just need some free time to learn how to clone my current drive and install the new SSD's (my buddy had free time one weekend and offered to put all the components together for me while I was out of town -- no idea how to hook this stuff up)."
