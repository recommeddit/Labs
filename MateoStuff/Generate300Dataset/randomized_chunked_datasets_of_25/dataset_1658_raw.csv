From the start of this year SQ went from $200 > $250 > $200 > $250 3 or 4 times so I thought I'm not going to let that fucker lose me 25% again when it hits ~$250 I'm selling. Bastard stopped following the pattern after I sold.
Thanks everyone! This was super helpful and led me to choose Elsinore. Level 2 in the books!...and I am in love.
There's no other way to do it.
"The Mexican-American War has somewhat of a mixed reputation. On the one hand it's a pretty patriotic war as you had the Alamo, manifest destiny, and such. On the other hand (as others have pointed out) that the issue of slavery was present during this war. You had some leader's of congress propose there be no expansion of slavery to the territories acquired through the war with Mexico (Wilmont Proviso). Others objected to this war on it being a war of imperial conquest and some like Henry David Thoreau practiced civil disobedience against the prosecution of the conflict. Also many consider the way that James K. Polk's efforts to deescalate the situation with Mexico as disingenuous as seen in the unreasonable demands carried by Slidell who was sent to negotiate on where the border with Mexico should be. This sort of expansionist attitude is seen to have continued under president Franklin Pierce when he tried to annex Cuba and other Carribran, central, and south american territories for the sake of creating more slave states.

In addition to this the Mexican-American War is seen as a training ground for future leader's of the American Civil War. Men such as Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and US Grant served in the conflict and had an impact on their role in the future war.

Basically this war has a pretty mixed reputation but tends to lean towards it being somewhat negative depending on who you ask. I will say that for the most part I personally do not think that we are sorry that we acquired the lands that we did though (Santa Anna was a chump, Mexico was a corrupt country run by Caudillos, etc.). Should we have fought this war-perhaps not. But I do not think that we feel sorry enough to give the land acquired back to Mexico."
"Has to be the Witcher 3, surely?!?! Combat isn’t the best compared to something like God of War, but alongside RDR2 the best story/voice acting of any game i’ve ever played.

Ghost of Tsushima also a fun one to play through."
"My dentist told me not to rinse out my toothpaste after brushing, just spit it out and that's it. That allows it to sit on the teeth longer"
"it is true. i don’t even know where my xbox 360 games are but i definitely have them and have no intention of playing them again, and there are many others like me. definitely accept their gifts, there are great people out there."

"No idea how the Swiss, the US and Austria are ahead of Ukraine. Ukraine won their group for Euro qualification and was in pot A for Europa League with a big win over Spain. Pretty sure they tied Germany as well. They should be where the Swiss are."
"It's really a guessing game of what is going to work well with your body chemistry. I am a perfume collector and have about 50 bottles ranging from $15 to $115. And you know what I get the most compliments over? The original Paris Hilton perfume. Not just occasionally. Every single time I wear it I get at least two compliments over how good I smell. My sister bought me a bottle like 10 years ago and I still buy it for that reason. One cool thing you can do is something like Scent Bird. It's like $15(?) a month and you get a decent size ""sampler"" every month. You can pick from 100s of perfumes and cologne. It's pretty convenient and let's you try a really wide range of stuff!"
Chocolate fudge brownies for me is the best
"Yea that's exactly what it is.

New Hampshire is pretty great for sure, but I think I prefer the Adirondacks, at least from what I've hiked."
"I did this when I used to travel a lot more.  I had some bright green zip ties that I would use.  (They also made my generic black luggage a bit easier to find on the carousel.)

I'd put spares, bright orange ones, on top of my stuff, in a baggie labeled ""TSA - Please use these to relock""

Just about every time, I'd get my bag back sealed with bright orange ones.

Never had anything disappear from my bags."

Shiroyama and Last Dying Breath are great to workout to as well.
This one does it for me. I really love AI causing accidental humor. Is there a subreddit for that?
i really like that we finally have a spider-man who looks like a high school child instead of being played by 30-somethings. when i first saw/heard him in the civil war trailer i thought “oh my god he’s a baby”. instead of like the scene in spider-man 2 when everyone sees him on the train and one guy is like “he’s a kid. he’s my son’s age” like yeah dude if you’re 55 and your son has a mortgage.
Can you guys help me finding resources on getting into a college/university in california from europe?
"Yeah after like 2 races it just didn't have enough fuel. Fast as balls though. I don't remember ever using the other one, was like a teal colour iirc."
"Ha!  I got to admit, that is value added.  I must have missed that series.  

:D"
I couldn't imagine being away from my 3 month-old for the night. Especially since I nurse.
"I love the bath and sleep ideas, but I just want to share with everybody else that there is [no link between vitamin c and a pre-established cold](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/06/050628064753.htm). However, there is probably a link between prevention, especially when exposed to extreme conditions."

"I would say that Siteground is a good web hosting choice, especially for beginners. 

Few things that stand out for me: 

Support is brilliant 

Tools are awesome 

Quick (weak point for Bluehost) 

Stupidly cheap 

I would also recommend Bluehost tbf but Siteground takes it for me. 

Also, does anyone know if Bluehost have discount codes btw?"
