14961,best romantic novel,I like to tell people Outlander is an adventure series with really great romance and sex scenes thrown in.
67566,axios alternatives reddit,"Success is generally regarded as `200 >= x < 400`, so that seems correct."
67575,axios alternatives reddit,"I posted about a week ago that in the light of request becoming deprecated I have started building my own http client that is almost a clone of request as far the API goes, except that it supports promises out of the box and doesn't comprise on stream support.   
It's still fairly new and I want to write a more comprehensive test suite before I mark it as v1.0.0 and I also would like community feedback but I think it is ready for people to try it out.  


I am seeing a lot of things in this thread that people value that I am thinking might be good to add. An option to throw errors 400 and above statusCodes, maybe response type auto-detection? Currently I leave the response body as a Buffer unless explicitly passed a JSON option.   


Anyways, for anybody who liked ""request"", I hope you check out my module, and give some feedback. Anyways here it is: [Beggar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beggar)"

73894,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Unfortunately I haven’t come across any non matte protector that still gives paper like feel. Maybe it’s not possible. Clear and glass protectors are none matte and don’t give paper feel, more like a glass feel as the standard iPad screen and because of this they don’t reduce the screen quality like matte does."
30128,best Mexican war to study,"It was quite controversial at the time. A lot of anti-Slavery Northerners thought that it was a phony, pretextual war that was based on a lie and perpetrated for the benefit of the slave states."

73106,best Linux distro,"Manjaro has been my linux distro for the past 2 years. Its stable, works out of the box and has an awesome community.

I had to use Windows 10 for the last 20 days due to some project work that had specific requirements, and here's what happened:

1. Sluggish OS, regularly needed ""cleaning"" software
2. Desktop would not load on initial login. Had to switch user and then login again.
3. Got random ads from Microsoft for ""Edge"", when I was using Edge.
4. Battery life was a bit better, but it would soft shutdown to preserve battery - not good when work is running in the background.
5. Received Updates that killed my system. Had to completely reset Windows 10, affecting time on work.

Manjaro? Works like a charm. I use xfce now, but in the past I used GNOME and KDE. I love GNOME more than KDE (just my view) because it was so simple and out of the way. Now Im using Xfce, and its so fast, and never does the crap that Windows did in 20 days. My only wish is that battery life would be better on linux.

Kudos to the Manjaro team for something so awesome!"

5222,best home improvement store,I find the exact opposite to be true with Lowes. I have had a lot of difficulty returning items there even with a receipt. HD on the other hand will often take returns or at least replace items with no receipt.

68608,best science fiction novel,I wish people would see that Scifi exist in other language too... As far as I can see there is no non english award there.

51601,best iphone case,They feel good. But they degrade like hell.
2586,best headphones,"Paid 99$ for my Q701 and 150 for my HE-300. I also nabbed that Pre-order from vsonic which includes an earphone with a gr07 driver for 40$. As a Canadian,  the sweet spot is in patience.  I also got those Shure 940s for 90$. And had a pair or Focal pro's and Focal Spirit ones,  both which I paid less than 200 for.  
If I had to name a price though I'd say the sweet spot is 200. You can get a Q701,  or AD900 for under 200 anywhere I the world if you buy used, sometimes it can be had new.  In terms of Iems you get can get some great stuff for under 150  including the GR07 and RE400."

35313,best alcoholic drink,"What it really depends on is if they use the full amount of liquor called for in a genuine Long Island, which I believe is at least 1 oz., possibly 1.5oz. of *four* different liquors. If they’re using that much, I don’t give a shit if it tastes like lemonade. Unfortunately, most places don’t put that much liquor at all. If you go to chain restaurants, you’re probably not getting more than 2oz. of liquor in a Long Island."
