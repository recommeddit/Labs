67575,"I posted about a week ago that in the light of request becoming deprecated I have started building my own http client that is almost a clone of request as far the API goes, except that it supports promises out of the box and doesn't comprise on stream support.   
It's still fairly new and I want to write a more comprehensive test suite before I mark it as v1.0.0 and I also would like community feedback but I think it is ready for people to try it out.  


I am seeing a lot of things in this thread that people value that I am thinking might be good to add. An option to throw errors 400 and above statusCodes, maybe response type auto-detection? Currently I leave the response body as a Buffer unless explicitly passed a JSON option.   


Anyways, for anybody who liked ""request"", I hope you check out my module, and give some feedback. Anyways here it is: [Beggar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beggar)",axios alternatives reddit

73106,"Manjaro has been my linux distro for the past 2 years. Its stable, works out of the box and has an awesome community.

I had to use Windows 10 for the last 20 days due to some project work that had specific requirements, and here's what happened:

1. Sluggish OS, regularly needed ""cleaning"" software
2. Desktop would not load on initial login. Had to switch user and then login again.
3. Got random ads from Microsoft for ""Edge"", when I was using Edge.
4. Battery life was a bit better, but it would soft shutdown to preserve battery - not good when work is running in the background.
5. Received Updates that killed my system. Had to completely reset Windows 10, affecting time on work.

Manjaro? Works like a charm. I use xfce now, but in the past I used GNOME and KDE. I love GNOME more than KDE (just my view) because it was so simple and out of the way. Now Im using Xfce, and its so fast, and never does the crap that Windows did in 20 days. My only wish is that battery life would be better on linux.

Kudos to the Manjaro team for something so awesome!",best Linux distro

2586,"Paid 99$ for my Q701 and 150 for my HE-300. I also nabbed that Pre-order from vsonic which includes an earphone with a gr07 driver for 40$. As a Canadian,  the sweet spot is in patience.  I also got those Shure 940s for 90$. And had a pair or Focal pro's and Focal Spirit ones,  both which I paid less than 200 for.  
If I had to name a price though I'd say the sweet spot is 200. You can get a Q701,  or AD900 for under 200 anywhere I the world if you buy used, sometimes it can be had new.  In terms of Iems you get can get some great stuff for under 150  including the GR07 and RE400.",best headphones

If they’re using that much, I don’t give a shit if it tastes like lemonade. Unfortunately, most places don’t put that much liquor at all. If you go to chain restaurants, you’re probably not getting more than 2oz. of liquor in a Long Island.",best alcoholic drink
