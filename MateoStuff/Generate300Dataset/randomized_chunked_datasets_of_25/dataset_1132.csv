23469,best car racing video game,"Underground 1 and 2 (and Fuel, but that's different story) were the only racing games I enjoyed and completed, as someone who generally never touches any sports/racing games."
59584,best perfume,"I can tell you’re an experienced connoisseur of fragrance by the fact that so many of your faves are modern takes on classic masculine compositions (fougères, orientals, leathers). You are a stylish, extroverted person (probably a guy) who holds themselves to high standards. You present a strong but not narcissistic image of yourself to others. I imagine you’re between 28 and 38 and very successful in your profession. The warm, sweet, and woody elements in many of these speak to a more reserved, sensual side that you like to hint at but not display openly all the time. You’re quite fashionable, but warm, and very open with those you know well."

57325,best water brand,"I forget the name of the documentary now, I saw it years ago, but it's about bottled water and Nestle. They just go to different cities/towns and bottle their water then leave."

11978,best gifts for dad,"You're welcome. And Happy Father's Day in advance! I love that video. I love how it embraces (and exaggerates) all of the quirks, but does it in a respectful manner instead of just an ""UGGGHHH DAD"" perspective."

38553,best newspapers to read,"Small-town Iowan here. While the internet is the main source for national and international news, I think it is important to keep up on local issues and narratives in the community. Without the local newspaper, that would be nigh impossible.

So yes."
59330,best perfume,"that's an incredibly generous offer, thank you! we're just walking in to IT2, so I'll dm you tomorrow! ta!"
14826,best romantic novel,"{Cherry beats by vicki james} or probably the only book I had read previously(and reread multiple times since) that would fit the title of well written. It's funny, it's heartfelt, the characters are human and make human mistake, they then grow from them into being better. Also Presley is Sooooo swoon worthy.


However I recently read {a bridge between us by k.k. Allen} , and i was completely invested in the story. A sweet, well written, slightly romeo and juliet'esque story.  So I definitely had to mention that one as well. Definitely going on my to buy list(I'm one of those weirdos who only buys a book after they've read it, so kindle unlimited is one of the best things ever for me. To be fair though I just hate spending money on a book that i could get halfway through and hate it. It's happened too many times)."
26667,best board games,"Be VERY careful with expansions/add-ins to zombicide. Some of the added heroes make the game too easy, and you'll curb-stomp everything. 

And I wouldn't add things in until you do start to get bored. Enjoy it bit by bit then add it in."
6699,best iPhone,"The 12 mini is minimalist in a sense. It’s super light and a bit smaller than the SE or 8, and with good battery life. 

As far as tech minimalism, have you researched the Light Phone II? It’s interesting. I’ve only read about it."
14179,best place to get free books,Don't forget /r/freeEBOOKS :)
8908,best toothpaste,"Outside of toothpaste uses, it's an abrasive. So why would this be different when combined with a toothpaste? I don't see how people claim it is not. Personally when i use baking soda toothpaste for a period of time my gums and mouth overall feel pretty scratched up and rough. This is enough evidence for me."
44680,best items under $100,Underrated: Metal tongue scraper.
70254,best major to study in college,"This is very true, English on it's own isn't a crazy strong major but I'm pairing mine with Professional Writing minor and Information Technology minor to hopefully become a technical writer but my current internship is in research and marketing so it's a very versatile major. The issue is if you go into English you really need to get ready to read/write a lot of stuff. It's an interesting major but it's not incredibly fun in my opinion."
56188,best action and adventure movie,"'How the fuck did they do THAT?.... oh they just... did it. Fair enough.'

Incredible movie and an astonishing creation considering its almost entirely quick cuts and moves at a dizzying pace yet remains completely coherent."
