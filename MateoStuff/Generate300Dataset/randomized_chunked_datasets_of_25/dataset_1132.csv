59584,"I can tell you’re an experienced connoisseur of fragrance by the fact that so many of your faves are modern takes on classic masculine compositions (fougères, orientals, leathers). You are a stylish, extroverted person (probably a guy) who holds themselves to high standards. You present a strong but not narcissistic image of yourself to others. I imagine you’re between 28 and 38 and very successful in your profession. The warm, sweet, and woody elements in many of these speak to a more reserved, sensual side that you like to hint at but not display openly all the time. You’re quite fashionable, but warm, and very open with those you know well.",best perfume

14826,"{Cherry beats by vicki james} or probably the only book I had read previously(and reread multiple times since) that would fit the title of well written. It's funny, it's heartfelt, the characters are human and make human mistake, they then grow from them into being better. Also Presley is Sooooo swoon worthy.


However I recently read {a bridge between us by k.k. Allen} , and i was completely invested in the story. A sweet, well written, slightly romeo and juliet'esque story.  So I definitely had to mention that one as well. Definitely going on my to buy list(I'm one of those weirdos who only buys a book after they've read it, so kindle unlimited is one of the best things ever for me. To be fair though I just hate spending money on a book that i could get halfway through and hate it. It's happened too many times).",best romantic novel
