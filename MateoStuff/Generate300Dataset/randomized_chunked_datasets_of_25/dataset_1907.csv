70125,"I'm not sure I'd read that the same way. As someone who has been in the labor market for a couple of decades, I'd agree that STEM graduates tend to have a higher starting salary and employment rate than ""soft skills"" graduates. However, it's also been my experience than ""soft skills"" graduates (albeit ones that have entered a professional career) have a better success rate than STEM graduates.

Honestly there isnt much difference between the tooth pastes as the big companies would like you to believe.  I do recommend one with flouride though (don't buy into the anti-flouride hype people, facebook science is not science).  What is most important is the mechanical action that your brushing is doing to break up the bio film created by the bacteria on your teeth.  Good oral hygiene is achieved by **mechanical methods** not chemical methods as much.  
Now this doesn't mean you need to brush hard, quite the opposite, get a soft bristle brush, brush in little circles with a 45 degree angle with the brush on your gums and tooth for best results. 

Brush 2 times per day.  Have a routine, don't just brush like a wild man, go from quadrant to quadrant.

Floss once a day.

*Pro tip*!:  Hate flossing?  Takes up too much of your time before bed?  Simple, floss while you watch TV or when you are relaxing at any other time in the day.  That way it won't feel like such a chore.",best toothpaste
