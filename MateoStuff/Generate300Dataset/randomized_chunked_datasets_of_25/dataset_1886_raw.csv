"I read a lot of blog posts, and books on the topic. Most book handle alternative ways of doing todo lists and working through them. That's personal and you need to find your balance.

I learnt a lot from reading ""what most successful people so before breakfast"". The author comes back on her book, ""168 hours"" where she proposes to plan on a weekly basis and to factor in unplanned events (no need to read that one). She talks about how people manage sport, food, career, kids, family. What do you delegate? What should you invest in? 
Also the audio version is very nice :)"
You said this as a joke but I swear to you my SO's grandmother tried to set her up on a date 10 years into our relationship.
Is she just rude? Do you have any story in particular?
"I was a touch puzzled. I didn't think I was completely out of touch with modern science fiction but I recognised very few names let alone books on that list.

I was more familiar with the runners up

There's definitely some  titles on that list to add to my reading schedule."
Occupy The Bookstore. When you go to buy your textbooks on your schools bookstore website it will automatically find them at different online stores for rent or purchase usually at a much cheaper price. I saved hundreds on textbooks my final year of school.
"I honestly don't know. It's possible that the kind of sales I would stock up on happen often enough that I wouldn't need to buy in huge quantities.  Then again, I wouldn't have to go to the store as often, or spend my time searching for coupons and sales every week."
"I'm a chemist. I hate my job. Probably just the company though. I love science, just not what I'm doing."
I can't stop laughing at panel 4
Health bars. Reese's. Lemon heads. Peel twizlers. Those purple and black wrapped peanut butter taffy things.
Not a chrome extension but a desktop app for Windows that does it called Ditto. The application runs in the system tray and  records your history across all apps and has a quick toggle that brings up your history anywhere. You can also sync history across multiple PC's. https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/index.php
I'm glad to see Root rise a little bit. It's a recent purchase of mine after I had fun with one game of it but one of the complaints I've heard about it is lack of replay-ability after playing all the factions. I'm hoping this is a sign that there is some longevity to the game.
I’m with whateva was the first time I realized “oh shit lil Wayne can really rap”
"Khloe’s flaw is that she ever trusted Tristan. I also personally think that the Jenner’s fall short when it comes to acknowledging their privilege. I think that rob sr. made sure that his kids understood how others lived and it’s helped the older sisters be a little more grounded. Of course, it may be an age thing"
Um Shane Dawson isn't a reliable source for nutrition information lol
"The 175-U is ~$300, does that count as budget still?

>but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.

Yeah I'm aware of that, but I'm just getting annoyed by cables lol. And since I switched to an HD 598 I don't really wanna go back to a general gaming headset quality, cause it's such a downgrade when listening to music

But either way, !thanks for the suggestions:D"
"Oh lol, I guess I’m a bit dumb"
Thanks for sharing. Never heard of Epic Browser.

"I was glad how well it did too. It made almost a billion dollars worldwide, so hopefully the industry takes that as a sign that there's a huge market for fun adventure movies."
Disco! Nothing quite like it!
Both ohms and sensitivity are dependent on your amplifier. This is incorrect and is most likely a troll post.
"It's not merely a White People list but a White Male list. The list is also saturated with British and American musicians. Musical styles or artists in just about any Asian, African, or South American country is completely disregarded. But who's surprised? It's exactly the same as NME's narrow-minded viewpoint on music."
