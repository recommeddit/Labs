I pretend the Nicolas Cage movie Knowing is somehow a National Treasure sequel
"Dude, Courtney Milan! Love her. I read all of the Brothers Sinister series in like a month because I was hooked. A little cliche, but the writing was very well done and her characters felt real, cliches and all. Definitely worth a read!"
"Disney California Adventure went from meh to really good.

Since 2010 they added Cars Land, World of colours, remake the entrance, Guardians of the Galaxy and Pixar Pier. And Avengers Campus is coming."
I never said Aamir said he was the best in an interview - I don't think even he would be silly enough to do that - it would be a PR disaster. You can easily google what people have thought of him especially during his Oscar campaign with Lagaan and his other movies as well. At the end of the day - these are just opinions of how we personally view stars.
iPhone X. Magical device from the start and still great after 2+ years of using it.
Well that got dark quick.
"From wikipedia:

>In a commentary track for the 20th Anniversary audiobook edition of the novel, as well as in the 1991 Author's Definitive Edition, Card stated that Ender's Game was written specifically to establish the character of Ender for his role of the Speaker in Speaker for the Dead, the outline for which he had written before novelizing Ender's Game."

They did a much better job this year.

"I had this several years ago-not a strong garlic taste, but it gave you breath that is toxic to small animals.
There are better ways to make ice cream."

How about the Rig 800LX?
"Upping your lighting game is way more important than a super fancy camera. If you can improve your lighting, your video quality will also improve. Pretty much all webcams look like crap in low light."
"I havent played the Disgaea series and to be frank in the past the word has put me off since I have no idea idea what the fuck thats supposed to mean.  But I will definitely look into it now and watch some gameplay vids and look at some reviews.

I really want to add banjo kazooie: nuts and bolts.  Problem is, most people hate that game for what it did to the franchise (myself included).
So while on its own its a decent game I just can't bring myself to put it on the list.  Poor Banjo :("
"Have an upvote for the website is down.  I laughed when I saw it years ago and it still makes me laugh.

Whisky sour on the rocks. Preferred whisky/bourbon + syrup + lemon juice + ice. Be careful when you stand up to use the bathroom!
Don't sleep on Vol 2 either! I would just put the tape on and go ham for a solid couple of months
I un-fitness you.
Does this work for iphone?
"This article is some combination of confused, wrong, and outdated, but it's hard to tell exactly which since it doesn't cite sources properly.

Here are some more definitive articles:

[Hand Sanitizer Gel Works](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050906072744.htm): ""Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel significantly reduces the spread of gastrointestinal infections in the home ... there is evidence that rotavirus, the most common GI infection in the child-care setting, is not removed effectively by soap and water but is reliably killed by alcohol [in hand sanitizers].""

[Hand Sanitizer Alert](http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-0955.htm): ""Hand sanitizers were effective in reducing gastrointestinal illnesses in households (1), in curbing absentee rates in elementary schools (2), and in reducing illnesses in university dormitories (3).""  

However, that article points out that you should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.  (The one I have in my office is 62%, a generic brand purchased at a pharmacy.) It seems that older, lower-alcohol or non-alcohol based sanitizer has contributed to an impression that sanitizers don't work well.  In particular, this article mentions that in a test of a 40% alcohol hand sanitizer ""purchased at a retail discount store ... observed an apparent increase in the concentration of bacteria in handprints impressed on agar plates after cleansing.""  

The important point, though, is that ""None of the other hand cleaners showed such an effect."""
