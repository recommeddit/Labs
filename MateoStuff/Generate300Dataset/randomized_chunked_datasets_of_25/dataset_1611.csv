65234,After reading your response I actually agree. While my experience on Ultra was good it is no longer the value that it was. Their promo rate for the 'unlimited' plan expired. I'm moving to US Mobile with 3 lines in 1-2 months for the Unlimited All (2 on Super LTE and 1 on GSM LTE). I found their customer support to be very good and responsive and with the new family plan rates it is really hard to beat those prices. The experience on Super LTE has been good. I haven't tested the GSM LTE network yet but I will soon.,best phone service company
11663,"For a second I thought you were going to say he passed away. I'm glad he's still kicking, and it sounds like you are very thoughtful! This is a really nice gift. 

My parents are nowhere near old enough to be planning for their ends, but I sometimes think about starting to anyway. I know it's morbid to think about it,  but my parents were high school sweethearts, got married at 18, waited 16 years to have kids, and have been married for over 35 years now. I can honestly say that I know they love each other because of the small things they still do for each other all the time. They still hold hands sometimes just walking around the grocery store for goodness sake. 

 I just know that when one of them passes, the remaining one will just be destroyed emotionally. I am so sad thinking about it, but planning their funerals would probably make it easier on all of us. 

How did you go about giving him a coffin? Like, how did you tell your dad you were doing that without him getting offended? Obviously the intentions are good, but I'm  worried he thinks I'll be calling him old or that I'm anticipating his death.",best gifts for dad

I like the guitar because you can learn shapes.  Like, if you look at a g major barre chord vs an a major barre chord (both rooted on the low 6th string), you'll notice the shape of your fingers is the exact same, you've just moved the ""major"" shape to a different fret.  Because of this, you can get pretty far on the guitar with minimal music theory knowledge. 

However, as others have said, it depends on your goal.  If the goal is to learn music theory, guitar is pretty rough until it clicks.  Learning the fretboard is a real bastard, fingering jazz chords and sweeping arpeggios gets really technical and challenging.  

But if you're just trying to learn a few songs and casually play here and there, its very approachable and there are so many resources online like tabs (which are a huge no no if theory is the focus) and YouTube tutorials.  Id say the availability of online resources is probably more prominent for the guitar than for any other instrument.",best instrument to play

53796,"It can be one of the following:  
**Easy Mode**  
Put a lot of chili into your food (preferably something like a taco or a sandwhich) and eat it. The spiciness will make your eyes cry and your nose runny. You'll also drink a lot of  water which helps you push away the cold faster. Repeat as necessary.  
  
**Hard Mode**  
Make a cup of chamomile tea and let it cool down. Don't add anything. Grab a small cotton ball, dunk it on the tea and carefully make drops of the liquid fall into your nostrils. Do not inhale but let it slide all the way down your throat. When I do (or was forced by my mom to do this) that, usually the cold is gone the next day guaranteed.
