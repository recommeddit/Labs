38111,best Marvel movie,Iâ€™m this got me thinking... what happens when the Sony deal is over? Does he leave the mcu like he never existed?
49518,best gaming monitor,"I know from experience the ips/pls will have better color compared to a tn.

Most gamers go for a tn because it has a faster refresh.

A lot of the ips/pls panels are overclockable with a proper cable type.

My qnix qx2710 is oc to 100hz with a dvi-d cable atm and looks great.

I watch a lot of movies and game a little, so I went the pls route.

You might be happier with a tn if you play FPS shooters a lot."
