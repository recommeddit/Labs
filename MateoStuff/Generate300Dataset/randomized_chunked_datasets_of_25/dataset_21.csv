46257,"> Do I let kids pick candy from a bowl or do I drop it in their bag?

I let the kids pick. It sucks when you're a kid and someone drops the **wrong one** into the loot sack. Also, this way I can tell the nice kids from the little shits, which might be useful information someday. Nice kids tentatively pick their one favorite, the little bastards grab a pudgy mittfull and run.

> What happens do I run out of candy?

People say that the other ""features"" the pastes advertise are more or less gimicks, and may or may not have any noticeable effects, but hey, if you find it works for you, then ride that placebo effect all day long.

This is going to get dark really quick.

I remind my wife that there are people who wish they could see their kids grow so fast, and be moving ahead. That them growing and changing means im doing my job, and that they are able to.

Our countries lockdown sucks, but my kids can go to school and learn now as we struggle to get ahead in our careers.

Im getting wrinkles, and waking up with new pains every day. But spending your life together means growing old together. Your kids growing up means things are right.",best gifts for dad

45133,"Most keyboards you use do not have actual, real switches inside each key but one large electrical pad that each key hits when pressed.

When every key has its own physical, real switch, it is much easier to feel what you are typing. This leads to less errors, less cramped hands, and overall just being more satisfying to type on if you type a lot.

You can also choose what switches you get -- clicky/non-clicky, tactile/non-tactile, more force/less force, etc.",best items under $100
