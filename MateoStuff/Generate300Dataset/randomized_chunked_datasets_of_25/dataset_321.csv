39442,"The dark web can't be accessed with any of these browsers; It needs Tor. Privacy is not just important for ""criminals"" and addicts and pedophiles buying and selling online. 

Saying you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide, is like saying that you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. - Edward Snowden 

Why give important information to huge corporations when you don't need to? So Google can show you ads for video games and dog products (example)? Why should they know what kind of porn you watch? Or what you discuss online with your friends, be it public posts or private messages?

In a not very distant future, these tech giants will be able to rule the world. Facebook is already minting currency (which they call cryptocurrency even if it's not true); Google is on the forefront of AI, Amazon already owns most of the servers from which the most prominent websites (Reddit is one of them) run, while dominating multiple other markets. When the day comes, they won't need to register us and give us ID cards, they will already have all the info. But we can avoid that by giving as little information and access as possible to them.

What I'll say is if you're willing to consider used:  
$300 or under go used and try to get a 1080 or Vega 56/64 because those will stomp the 1660 or 1660 Ti hands down and AMD RX 590 is laughably not worth $275.  
  
If you can squeeze another $30-$60 try to grab a 5700 or 2060 Super.  
I hate to say it but new GPU's under $300 just don't cut it right now. The 570 8GB if you can get it at $100 is the only good value under $300 IMO.",best midrange GPU
