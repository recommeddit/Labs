"For real, $440 will get you a 11400, a solid B560 board, and 16GB of 3600C16 memory, or even $410 if you live near a microcenter. 3-4 years down the line if (when) 6-core CPUs start showing their age, you can sell the combination for $250ish or pass it down to friends/family and get another midrange build on the newest platform that outperforms the current high-end chips. 

There's of course edge cases like 360 Hz esports players but for the vast majority of gamers with a 3070/6700XT-class GPU or worse the difference between a 11400 and 5800X/11700k/10900k in current titles is going to be pretty much nonexistent. The performance gap has narrowed massively between the low-end and higher-end parts recently. Not nearly as many caveats now as with previous budget heros like the 1600AF, i3-9100, etc."
"If you are out near lompoc check out Giant Manhattan pizza (Vandenberg village?), There is Ginos on Ave of the flags in buellton. And tower pizza is Solvang(reminds me of rustys)."

"Better than firefox, in terms of speed at least...

I could fall asleep sometimes until firefox opens even on a fast pc. Earlier (arround 2013 or even earlier) firefox was ok performance wise but now...

I dont like it personally...

But can you really be ""save"" on the internet? Not really I think"
There are actually a shit ton of streamers who still stream without webcam and still be successful. Idk if it’s a necessity but it’s definitely a plus if you have one I guess
"Agreed, everything else disintegrates in my mouth."

"This happened with Sileo to me as well. Now I just have all my repos in a note, and can import them all within a few seconds if needed."
"Wow. You know, if I was gonna go all kinetic on my back for more than a few paces? I think I'd be really glad to have this thing strapped to it."

Pure grace - philosophy. Soap and water clean scent. I constantly am getting compliments.
I don't think the 4 is that thick
"I’d agree with Zion! Grand Canyon is a few hours away, so is arches, and Las Vegas and flagstaff and salt lake aren’t crazy far either"
"...like Pumpernickel ice cream? I'd eat that. Might be nice with sweet, caramelized onions on top, too.  

Don't judge, you know I'm right. ;)"
"Same here. We are just getting new doors for our cabinets from them (probably ordering them next year) and I have yet to find a cheaper, better cabinet/cabinet door company to order from."
"Can highly recommend Shakewell, Pouya and Fat Nick (oh the irony)"
We read all about it in high school history back in the early 1990's. What's taught in US schools varies quite a lot depending on where the district is and how well it's funded.
What are both? Like what do they do?
"Wool: Omnibus, followed by Shift:Omnibus, by Hugh Howey.  It's more dystopian than fantasy, but wonderful all the same.  Unfortunately it is short.   

I'll second The Kingkiller Chronicles, by Rothfuss, Patrick.

The Lodestone Trilogy, by Whiteway, Mark.  It is long, detailed, and a satisfying read."
Nice. I don’t think I’ll buy one of that myself any time soon but the point of my post was to tell people that not all screen protectors are the same. I might consider it if I have more spare money.
