GT Sport has fully customizable livery on almost every car. PC2 has a Collector's Edition that has all but one of the DLCs, the extra one is $5, and GT Sport is still popping out more cars almost monthly. PC2 you can do single player races with every car from the get go, no collecting and buying cars.

16653,"We try to make her an indoor cat but it's virtually impossible. We live in an apartment complex with 25 units. It's very small and it's gated, so my kids come and go as they please. My cat is very fast. She will go from one end of the living room to the other once she realizes either one of my kids is going to open the screen door. The fault isn't entirely on them though. Sometimes when I'm coming inside, she positions herself near the door hinge and gets out through a narrow opening. I stick my leg in like I'm gonna kick her (I would never actually kick or hurt my cat, I just kick my leg around to scare her away from the door) and I have thunder thighs, so I need a biggish opening to get my leg in. Sometimes my kids think the door is latched when it's not. 

A long time ago I Googled how to prevent cats from escaping and all the forums were understandably against negative reinforcement, so I would feel bad about squirting with water when she gets near the door. I also read a suggestion that was to greet them in a specific spot in the house when you get home so they would rather go to that spot for attention than leave, but my cat never greets us when we get home. Sometimes she hangs out in the bedroom or bathroom. I'm at a loss with how to make her want to stay inside. Forcing her to stay is seemingly impossible.",best pet for toddlers

23130,"I just wanted to add another thought (it's 1am, so brain is starting to shut down).

Another good reason to create a github account is to become familiar with version control software. A lot of, if not most, companies want you to be familiar with at least one VCS. Lately it's generally either git or TFS (though some places will ask for subversion experience. I've almost never seen anywhere asking for mercurial and CVS is, thankfully, rarely asked for as well)

TFS now has free cloud based accounts for up to 5 users and TFS2013 and cloud support git repositories in addition to the old style TFS repos. If you do dev in the Microsoft ecosystem, it's not a bad idea to get both, honestly.

Keep your public stuff on github and your private stuff in TFS. As an added bonus, TFS also has a lot of ALM stuff baked in. It's not exactly intuitive, but it's not that hard to learn the basics of either (and is another selling point for you since you'd be familiar with bug tracking and agile tools as well)",best social networking site for CS

31193,"Good healthcare? 40 hour workweeks? I got two words friend:
government 
job
Ideally a progressive urban municipality. 

I work for a municipality in Utah as such, here is where I stand:

Being close to beautiful nature for hiking, biking, etc.--hell yes. I can get to high alpine afterwork in the summer.

40 hour workweek or less--yes

Equality between genders, and progressive values in general--On a state level, no. county level, yes.

Guaranteed healthcare--Extremely Cheap

Clean cities and public spaces--Cities aren't generally clean but we're next to a lot of national parks

Mild weather, or at least warm Springs and Summers--Definitely warm springs and summers. Cold winters though.

A good economy for both tech fields (my partner's) and social science related things (my interest)--Social science, no. tech fields, yes. Generally though, our economy is great.

The US covers such a large geographic area and the broad political climate addresses each of your criterion by a wide variety in contrast to a small European country. You already speak the language and you're a citizen. It would be substantially easier to attain these goals here because of this. 

Chattanooga Tennessee would likely fulfill many of these as well.",best country to live in
