2969,">Why does every single one of those sound like it was recorded off of a landline from 1960? Its always this horrific quality that you can barely understand. No phone sounds like that anymore

So that's the gotcha. Landlines are still using the legacy frequency ranges we have used for a century. Additional digital compression may be added by the phone company and phone system the radio station is using as well. They may also filter some frequncies as well if they can be problematic like hiss or background hum.

HD voice sounds great on modern phones. But if you are not calling an HD voice enabled line, which is pretty much every landline, you are falling back to older cellular voice codecs, which are far heavier compressed then landlines. This could be as new as ones introduced with 3G in the 2000s, but Verizon for example, still falls back to the CDMA codecs they used in the mid-90s and was designed for 2G, and as a result, sound absolutely horrid.

So you are hearing the result of legacy cell phone compression, on top of landline compression, on top of radio station phone system compression. That may be genuinely what the phone call sounds line once it reaches their equipment.",best webcamera
