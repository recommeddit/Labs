29838,best money managing app,"> TL:DR I want an app that can tell me: here's how much you have saved up, here's how much you can spend this week while still having enough for bills and saving a little money. Can also manually input cash transaction.

You're going to have to get into a monthly mindset.  All budgeting is based on monthly since the VAST majority of bills are all billed out monthly."
37057,best roller coaster at six flags,I understand where you're coming from. I'm from New York and I've been waiting to ride X since it first opened 11 years ago or whatever. We finally made it to six flags magic mountain and it was closed all day. Biggest disappointment of my life thus far.
5254,best home improvement store,This person did work.
50684,best rap album,"Best albums to me in no particular order are Mach Hommy, Slowthai and that killer project Flee Lord dropped with DJ Muggs. Alchemist This Thing of Ours is worth every minute too but it's too damn short"
5124,best home improvement store,"The Home Depot nearest to me is a complete cell phone dead zone the second you walk in the door and it probably sounds dumb, but if I'm making a major purchase in a store I like the option of being able to really quickly google something before I buy it."
1909,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Petrini’s definitely has a different crust.  I like it but I’m not sure it’s what you’re looking for.  They’re cheap though and worth a shot.

It kind of reminds me of saltines...not that it’s that crumbly/dry or even salty but it’s really more noticeable on day-old slices when you eat cold leftovers.  Not knocking it, just trying to describe it."
36484,best alcoholic drink,"Long Island Iced Tea (or any variation thereof). Might not always taste the best, but it sure gets the job done!"
56833,best desktop monitor,"I've been eyeing that monitor for a couple of days now.

27100,best board games,"There may be a lot of them, but I find their range is more diverse than ones like Brawling Brothers for example."
33751,best electric car,"I like them, I don't think theres any out now that I would buy personally, but I like them.  There's just a lot of new tech so you either get an affordable car with a fisher-price interior and muted driving experience or an expensive car with a fisher-price interior and fantastic driving experience or and even more expensive car with decent interior and fantastic driving experience."

47927,best color to paint with,"I actually love the Downing Straw color. I just wasn’t happy with the paint quality. I didn’t feel like it covered the way Behr does, and the sheen wasn’t to my liking. I like eggshell and this is closer to satin. It’s not horrible, but the whole experience was irritating."
