16773,"Cairn Terriers are great with kids. The Cairn Terrier Club of America states ""Cairns seem to have an inborn affinity for children. They are physically very tough, and forgive or overlook mishaps and stepped-on feet with characteristic generosity of spirit.""

They're very playful without being over the top and they're sensitive enough that they're careful not to take a child down. When the breeder of our last Cairn found out there were young children in the family (under 4 years old) she was ecstatic and told us the dog will love the children and that has been absolutely true.",best pet for toddlers

52442,I think it’s boring. There’s no objective way to view it champ. The beats get stale after 4-5 songs and I don’t enjoy listening to them. The fact that you’re this upset over someone on Reddit calling Illmatic a bit boring is honestly concerning lmao,best hiphop album
9691,"If you aren’t there for Summer Session, a lot of people have already made friends and aren’t as social as other dorms. It’s also the only freshman dorm on campus that hasn’t been renovated in a while so everything’s a little worse than the others. Rooms are also pretty small and mostly triples. About 1/8 of the building has a great ocean view though",best dorm hall at UCSB

66964,"Bayern Munich under Jupp Heynckes (which culminated with the treble in 12/13). Their way of playing football was a joy to watch: fast passing football with the fullbacks attacking non-stop.

I also believe the Milan team under Sacchi and Capello with the Dutch trio, Baresi, a young Maldini etc. deserves a mention. Five Champions League finals in seven years, which they won three of them speaks for itself.",best soccer team in the world
