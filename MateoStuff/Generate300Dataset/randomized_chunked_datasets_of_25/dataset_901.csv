16773,best pet for toddlers,"Cairn Terriers are great with kids. The Cairn Terrier Club of America states ""Cairns seem to have an inborn affinity for children. They are physically very tough, and forgive or overlook mishaps and stepped-on feet with characteristic generosity of spirit.""

They're very playful without being over the top and they're sensitive enough that they're careful not to take a child down. When the breeder of our last Cairn found out there were young children in the family (under 4 years old) she was ecstatic and told us the dog will love the children and that has been absolutely true."

29438,best game console,"1. Suikoden 2 (PS1)
2. Dark Souls (Xbox 360)
3. Legend of Zelda OoT (N64) [This decision was harder than you think.]
4. Rallisport Challenge 2 (Xbox)
5. Final Fantasy X (PS2)

Honorable Mention and the reason for my edit: 5+. Dark Cloud 2 (PS2). I put it down first and then realized I played about 10x as much FFX as I did Dark Cloud."
52442,best hiphop album,I think it’s boring. There’s no objective way to view it champ. The beats get stale after 4-5 songs and I don’t enjoy listening to them. The fact that you’re this upset over someone on Reddit calling Illmatic a bit boring is honestly concerning lmao
9691,best dorm hall at UCSB,"If you aren’t there for Summer Session, a lot of people have already made friends and aren’t as social as other dorms. It’s also the only freshman dorm on campus that hasn’t been renovated in a while so everything’s a little worse than the others. Rooms are also pretty small and mostly triples. About 1/8 of the building has a great ocean view though"

72481,best keyboard switches,Try MX Clears. It has a much more pronounced bump than the brown. IMO they feel a lot better.
64113,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"It doesn't hurt to message the OP and ask if they can reupload, I've had a few do this with no issue."
32125,best hotel to live in,"Nayara Spring in Costa Rica. Individual huts in the middle of the jungle with views of a volcano. And an outdoor shower. This changed my life
 No shower will ever compare."
34523,best NFL player,Ike Taylor
8426,best toothpaste,"Novamin is amazing.  Because one corporation controls it in America, you can't get it without a prescription.  (unless you buy overseas)"
16734,best pet for toddlers,That’s something we’ve talked about.  I’m reading up on aquariums and all of that.
66964,best soccer team in the world,"Bayern Munich under Jupp Heynckes (which culminated with the treble in 12/13). Their way of playing football was a joy to watch: fast passing football with the fullbacks attacking non-stop.

I also believe the Milan team under Sacchi and Capello with the Dutch trio, Baresi, a young Maldini etc. deserves a mention. Five Champions League finals in seven years, which they won three of them speaks for itself."
56950,best water brand,Poland Springs is the real answer.

11149,best backpack for college,"I have to recommend this backpack: http://www.wengerna.com/synergy-12338

I've had mine for four years, and its as good as the day I got it.  I wear it to work daily -- ten to twenty pounds of gear, five miles a day. And it's comfortable. 

Will it outlast you? No idea. Will it outlast you at least two laptops? Easy.  

Edit: maybe I've had it three years."
15409,best tree for the garden,Most Oaks are a pain. I don't understand why people like them. So many leaves in the fall. So many...

55417,best action and adventure novel series,Amen to that!
47627,best state to visit in the United States,Spent a lot of weekends over there this summer. It always amazes me that something so beautiful and majestic is just a few hours away.
