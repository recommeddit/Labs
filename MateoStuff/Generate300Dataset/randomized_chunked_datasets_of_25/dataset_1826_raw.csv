Is it a time management problem? Or is it a motivation/interest problem? 99 out of 100 times it is the later.  And you'll never solve that regardless of how many productivity systems you try to implore.
"F-zero GX if you just mean racing games, but with cars, I would say Motorstorm Pacific Rift or Grid 1 unless you mean realistic but I am torn between Assetto corsa, Dirt rally and F1 2016"
"I went to a training thing this summer and didn't realize the rooms they set us up in didn't have any linens, so I went to a local store and bought a generic fleece blanket for like $15.  Holy shit not only is it huge, but it is warm as fuck, and now I still use it back home as my main sleeping blanket."
"Get a ps2, super cheap these days and most games are also cheap."
You'd rather do it irresponsibly? Or not at all?
"God, I know - I've read Watson's autobiography."
"Scrambled eggs, turkey (or chicken) sausage, sautéed mushrooms/tomatoes.  Very healthy, high protein, low carb.  VERY quick to make!"
It's always on Sunday. Every year.
That Chapter. I back to back his videos. Soothing low Fi and smooth Irish voiced cute guy talking about gruesome murders
"Is therr any way to utilize that durability? Like, apply it to our own technologies?"
I use a dull disposable razor. It's what a fashion designer/seamstress taught me.
"I agree, its one of the few war games I can get into. Very interesting choices and decisions."
"close but no champagne, no syrup, no juice, no lemon"
Or better sign up to it for free in last promotion (last sept I guess?)
"Chocolate chocolate chip.  First, because it's x2 of a good thing, and also because I like the texture of biting down into chunks of chocolate in ice cream."
God this makes me feel old. I used to use Rock Your Phone way back when.
That weird neck spasm thing he does creeps me out.
"The Hyatt in Seoul, S. Korea next to the airport. I'd just spent a semester in a shitty part of China though, so to me it was the greatest place on earth at the time. Plus, it was free due to an unexpectedly long lay over, and came with meal vouchers."
I saw this video and decided to go for more generic one. I got my for 28 EUR and it seems decent. It's gonna be delivered tomorrow to me and I hope it will look at least somewhat what people wrote about it and posted videos for.

Whats funny to me is that that make 40k a year sound bad. I would love to make that much money.
"I know. I've fallen behind a great deal. 

In my defense, I started having sex more frequently and after 10 ejaculations, my dick shrivels up and cries. 

Poor bastard was whimpering last night about needing a vacation."
"I own Ray Bans and while nice, they are part of the Luxottica monopoly. What I really want are a pair of Randolph Engineering sunglasses. They are made for pilots and are, from what I've heard, really well made. Alas, I need prescription lenses, but you should definitely check them out! I like The Intruder the best."
Nah to me Tom is the perfect mix of Toby and Andrew (Toby’s Peter Parker was really good but his Spider-Man wasn’t and Andrew’s Peter Parker wasn’t really good but his Spider-Man was).
"I use the Chrome extension, it works better than directly from the site."
