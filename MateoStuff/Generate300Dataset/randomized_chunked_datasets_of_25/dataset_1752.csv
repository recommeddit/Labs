23416,best car racing video game,Daytona USA is a classic. Team Sonic Racing and Racing Transformed are both quality titles. I have been playing Dirt 5 which is a lot of fun. Horizon 4 has spoilt us though!
32730,best vacation resort,"How am I being condescending?

Dude can take whatever sort of trip he/she fancies but this doesn't change the fact that such a property provides a far from ""real"" travel experience.

52166,best hiphop album,"His music is rather personal at times. I get he is labeled a cornball online but some of his music hits the same way Mac's music does for me. But thats just me. Joe is also extremely talented with his pen, mans had beef with some of the greatest and went back and forth with them. Got included in the super group Slaughterhouse for a reason. Theres a millions reasons to like his music. His personality does his music no favors though lol"

16822,best pet for toddlers,"1 and 2:  are kind of incompatible, in my experience. The smaller the dog, the nippier it is, and they tend to be twitchy around kids. But then, I'm biased against small dogs.
