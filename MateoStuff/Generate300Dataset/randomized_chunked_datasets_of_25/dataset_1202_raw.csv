"Transaction services is a broad term for financial services where you receive money in exchange for performing a service. one example is due diligence on companies for M&A or underwriting offerings, in exchange for your service you'd receive a one time fee. This is what i'm referring to when I talk about the transaction services or the transaction side of finance"
My embarrassing one is With Love by Hilary Duff. I got so many compliments from strangers when wearing it!
"This is so me! I find myself browsing requests that fit my favorite books just for an excuse to shamelessly recommend them all the time!

My all time faves are [Sugar Daddy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/306364.Sugar_Daddy?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=otGXg5AD1h&rank=1) by Lisa Kleypas, most books by Sherry Thomas and Maggie Osborne. I recently picked up Beach Read and The Wall of Winnipeg and enjoyed both so I can see why they are so often recommended! I started going through Mariana Zapata's other books, and discovered I enjoyed [From Lukov with Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37683751-from-lukov-with-love) even more than I liked Winnipeg.

I'm a huge Sherry Thomas fan but her [Lady Sherlock](https://www.goodreads.com/series/176858-lady-sherlock) series was on my TBR shelf for the longest time, because I heard the romance aspect isn't the main focus. I finally decided to give them a try since they were included for free in Audible's new Plus catalog. I finished the first 2 books so fast and now I'm already on the 3rd one. It's true that they are more fade-to-black when it comes to sex scenes, but I feel the intimate character insight she follows up with makes up for it. Charlotte and Ash might be my new favorite couple of all time now. So much fun and so well written!"

"Even though I'm a Finn and biased, I'd have to agree with you on the Winter War. Finns fought well with sub par equipment.. But thanks to the victory belong very much to Soviet leadership too. No winter gear, unrealistic expectations, rookie troops and pitiful scouting and coordination of troops lead to the disaster on their side.

Stalin personally did us a huge favor by killing / sending most of the generals to Siberia in one of his paranoid streaks."
"Like I said, you're still close enough for it to be regional for you. You can drive there. Out west it's far less known. Within a few states it's definitely well known."
"Rats are really great pets.  They do better in same sex pairs than alone.  They are extremely social creatures and prone to depression and neuroticism when kept alone.  One of the best and worst things about them is their short life span.  They live for 2-5 years, and then they die, usually from tumors.  Great for an early lesson in life and death.  Sad for any child who has to lose their companion.  If you want to ensure your pet will live for more than two years, find a reputable breeder and don't just take the ones deemed too pretty to be snake food.  The feeders pretty reliably drop after two years.  Oh and another thing, they don't really have control over their bladders.  You can poop train them, but males especially leave a small (really tiny) trail of urine everywhere they go.  It's scent marking.  Make sure you're cool with that.


The females are smaller than males.  Girls are hyper, boys are mellow.  If you want playful rats that will learn tricks, go for girls.  If you want a rat that will sit still, go for a boy.  One thing to watch out for, sometimes boys produce a smelly oily substance that, from what I hear, reeks.  I've had rats and never run into a smelly boy, but it's worth mentioning.

Hairless and tailless rats are available.  Hairless require extra work, they don't do well on aspen bedding (pretty much requiring cloth bedding that is changed daily)  If urine builds up on their bedding they get horrible rashes.  They can't control their body temperature very well.  They have very thin, delicate skin that rips and tears easily.  Can be cool, but I think they're more work than they are worth.  Tailless is (in my opinion) cruel.  Rats need their tails, for balance and for self temperature regulation.

Leopard geckos are all the rage these days, geckos in general are pretty great (make sure you don't get geckos prone to parthenogenesis like mourning geckos.  You don't want them spitting out babies every few weeks) .  

Bearded dragons are fairly docile, but require some work with their food.  

Roaches are a much nicer food source to work with than crickets.  They don't smell bad, they don't make noise, they don't bite as much.  Some people don't like roaches though.  

I do not recommend iguanas, tegus, savannah monitors or any other very large lizards.  They are not really beginner reptiles.  Be aware that many reptiles have very long lifespans.  

Snake wise, Ball pythons and corn snakes are docile and readily available.  Incredible beginner snakes.  Corns live in the US so they don't need specialized humidity the way that ball pythons do.  Also, corn snakes are reliable eaters and don't go off feed for months at a time the way ball pythons do.  

Don't buy your ball pythons from petsmart or other major chains (I don't recommend their corns either, but especially stay away from the pythons).  If you look on craigslist you should be able to find a breeder selling normal males for 20-30 dollars.  Make sure they are eating frozen thawed rats (not mice and not live).  Corn snakes can often be found on craigslist for 10-20. 

Most people either underfeed or overfeed their snakes.  Ball python babies should be on rat pups.  Corn snakes should be on mouse pinkies.  Once they don't have a lump in their tummy after a feed, go up to the next size. Feed them in their enclosures.  Some people used to think that you had to feed them in a separate container, but these days, we know better.  It doesn't make them aggressive and is one of the many things that would make your ball python stop eating.    

I don't recommend large snakes like burmese python, reticulated python, boa constrictor, or carpet python.  I also don't recommend bull snake, pine snake, or king snake.  They just don't have that ultra mellow attitude that you find with balls and corns.

Other snakes I recommend: african house snake, kenyan sand boa, and western hognose snake.

Have you considered Tarantulas, giant cockroaches, or an ant farm.  If you're looking for something that lives in a tank and doesn't require much care, bugs are easy as it gets.  They aren't great for kids to hold, though.  and there's also the fact that they are bugs and some people don't like that.

Any animal you choose is going to be much easier to deal with if you get an adult.  With adults you can check for temperament and overall health.  You don't have to deal with them when they are their most delicate.  

Sorry for the wall."

"I dunno.   I burned through an Eastpak in two years of college.  That was 1987-1989, so it's possible they've gotten better :-)"
"You most likely want your highest refresh rate monitor to be the one you use for gaming. If you plan on upgrading your frequency, then you prob want to be looking for a new monitor to game on. The added refresh rate won't help for movies/videos.

Alternatively, a similarly sized 1440p ips monitor would look extra crispy. Or if you wanted more space, a 29"" widescreen is about the same height panel as a 23.6-24"" panel."
"It might be my favorite sci-fi book, now that I think of it."
Jesus I  have so much to learn.
"I'm only including the ones I've been to. I still need Discovery Kingdom, Mexico, and La Ronde. 

1. Magic Mountain: Obviously they have a ton of coasters but I also love that they have some great Arrows as well as a good balance in the line up between old and new. Outside of the coaster line up I thought this was one of the nicest SF parks in general. Clean, pretty, and overall a great experience.

2. Great America: This is one of the more personable SF parks. There isn't really one stand out coaster here for me (closest would be Viper) but the overall line up is incredibly well rounded and it's another park that I have a good time at every time I visit.

3. Over Georgia: Another SF park with a bit of charm and a solid lineup. I think I enjoy Great America's lineup slightly better but Mind Bender and Goliath are both stand outs to me. I also love Monster Mansion.

4. New England: There's definitely a little home park bias here. Superman and Wicked Cyclone are good enough to elevate the park for me but it really needs another stand out coaster, more flats, and just more to do overall. 

5. St Louis: I would consider this the ""hidden gem"" of SF parks. It has 3 awesome woodies, all of which deliver different experiences and are great in their own way, while on the steel side of things, Mr. Freeze is a lot of fun. However, the park definitely is in need of a stand out new addition.

6. Great Adventure: Obviously El Toro and Nitro are fantastic and the safari is an incredible perk but I just never feel like I'm having much fun when I visit here. Mandatory lockers and the way they're enforced are honestly day ruining for me, sorry, and for the most part the park is quite ugly and laid out poorly. I also don't think I've ever been when the park wasn't absolutely packed, and while that isn't their fault, it does make me like it a bit less. That being said I'm really looking forward to Jersey Devil.

7. Fiesta Texas: This is by far the prettiest SF Park. I haven't ridden Wonder Woman so I'm sure that addition helps, but I find the coaster line up here to be a little lacking. Not a big fan of Iron Rattler.

8. Over Texas: Like Great Adventure, I just wasn't impressed with the park overall. The classic sections towards the middle of the park are cool but it doesn't feel like SF is putting in any real effort to preserve and showcase them and the rest of the park looks pretty dingy. I've only been once and didn't have the best experience with staff and overall cleanliness so hopefully my next visit is better. Ranking it below some of the other parks with similar problems because I didn't love any one particular coaster quite as much as I enjoy, for example, El Toro, but New Texas Giant and Shock Wave certainly are fantastic. 

9. America: SFA honestly isn't a bad park. It's just that nothing there besides Wild One is particularly noteworthy. It's also very strange that the park goes from fairly pretty and well themed in the front to an empty field in the back. I've been a few times and never really had issues with operations or anything like that though, which I know is a common complaint.

10. Frontier City: Cute little park. I don't remember much about Wildcat but obviously it's a classic. I really liked Diamondback because I'm a sucker for Arrow shuttle loops. Unfairly taking away points because it was like 95 degrees and crowded when I went, and because they wouldn't let us ride the kiddie coaster (yes I'm petty). In all seriousness, I'd love to see this park get a new addition. 

11. Darien Lake: Darien Lake is just SFA with abysmal operations and even less charm, if that's possible. I'll admit this is a park I've only visited once and didn't have the best experience at, so your mileage may vary. I will say that my one ride on Predator (would be great if we ran more than one train on anything) was a lot of fun.

12. Great Escape: I wouldn't call Great Escape a bad park. It's in the same boat as SFA where the only noteworthy coaster is Comet, and as much as I enjoyed Comet, I like Wild One a bit more. However, the rest of the coaster line up is...not great, which gives America the edge. One positive of this park is that it really is quite pretty. There's some cool theming in the form of story book characters and walk throughs, and I really appreciate that it has that personality. I understand the return on investment likely isn't there, but a new addition could go a long way here."
Just built ryzen 5 3600 with radeon 5700 xt. No problems and running 140 fps at 1080. Its awesome.
"If you like The Princess Bride, watch Stardust. Its on Netflix at the moment."
3rd year dental student here. I recommend Crest Pro-Health to nearly all of my patients.  The only other toothpaste I recommend is Sensodyne for my patients with sensitivity.
"If you haven't, you need to listen to the podcast The Dollop's episode on Micheal Malloy. It covers the same stuff but in a longer format. Anyone who likes Sam should check out the podcast as it covers really wacky stuff that has happened in history in a similar vein to his videos."
Omurice. Fried rice with omelet and ketchup.
For 2 weeks if you are interested in only going to Universal I would recommend Hard Rock or Portofino Bay. If you are renting a car and looking to do a bunch of different things in Orlando like visit Disney etc. I would recommend either staying at Universal and the other location for the days you are visiting or going to a hotel off property like Drury Inn. If you are renting a car 2 weeks of parking at Universal will cost you around $22 per day. Drury has free parking. Drury offers a shuttle to Universal. If you rent a car and stay off property you will be paying for parking at the theme parks.

"I plan on pairing a RTX-2060 with an i5-8400 or 8500. Maybe even the 9400F (no internal GPU). 

I have seen a lot of people recommend both the i5-8400/8500 or the AMD 2600 or 2600x for gaming builds at 144hz 1080p. 

&#x200B;

I am interested to see what some other people say here."
