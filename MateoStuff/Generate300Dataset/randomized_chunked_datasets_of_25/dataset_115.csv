73481,best battery bank,"Ya know, I thought about 2 small banks vs one big one. Let's me spread out weight backpacking, and is more versatile - don't have to bring both if I know I wouldn't need it.

But then I guess the main downfall I can think of is just logistically managing them and eventually realizing you forgot to charge one. Maybe not a real issue..."
63800,best books for building better habits reddit,"I am not a psychologist but from personal experience and observation I feel like willpower is being simplified. I think what we perceive as willpower is influenced by many different factors. 

Personally I don't believe that it can be depleted. With a muscle you can reach physical exhaustion but I don't think that you can exhaust someone's willpower so much that he is unable to resist any temptation.

I don't believe that it's a muscle. I don't think that willpower in one are can be improved with willpower exercises in another area.

Also I think it's important to make a distinction between the will to act and the will to resist. The latter is much easier.

But yeah creating habits is the key."

25142,best spiderman actor,Tobey was the best. Garfield and Hollanr are good but they definitely don't look nerdy. They both look like they could win prom king and I never picture Peter Parker as looking good enough to have women fawn over him the way they do Garfield and Holland
10226,best pencil for drawing,"Start with an ebony pencil. Be careful not to drop them as they are particularly sensitive. 

The thing about art pencils is that you have to be able to achieve dark grades without embossing the paper from pressing down too hard.

You only need a few pencils, a 1-3 H, a 2B, and a 6-10B. The 6-10Bs can hold off until later.

Plus ebonys are cheap.

Eberhard Faber ebonys are really cheap on ebay and you can buy in bulk for dollars (plus I think they have a better composition than the prismacolors."

8171,best toothpaste,"I have both a sonicare and a regular electric toothbrush, and can't make up my mind which is better.  Why do people swear on the Sonicare?  Is it just because its the ""Trendiest"" toothbrush now, or because it's people's first electric toothbrush.  My theory is that any electric toothbrush is 100x better than the manual kind, so sonicare or the standard kind are both fine."
