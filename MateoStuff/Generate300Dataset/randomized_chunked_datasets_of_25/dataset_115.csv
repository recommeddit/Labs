63800,"I am not a psychologist but from personal experience and observation I feel like willpower is being simplified. I think what we perceive as willpower is influenced by many different factors. 

Personally I don't believe that it can be depleted. With a muscle you can reach physical exhaustion but I don't think that you can exhaust someone's willpower so much that he is unable to resist any temptation.

I don't believe that it's a muscle. I don't think that willpower in one are can be improved with willpower exercises in another area.

Also I think it's important to make a distinction between the will to act and the will to resist. The latter is much easier.

But yeah creating habits is the key.",best books for building better habits reddit

10226,"Start with an ebony pencil. Be careful not to drop them as they are particularly sensitive. 

The thing about art pencils is that you have to be able to achieve dark grades without embossing the paper from pressing down too hard.

You only need a few pencils, a 1-3 H, a 2B, and a 6-10B. The 6-10Bs can hold off until later.

My theory is that any electric toothbrush is 100x better than the manual kind, so sonicare or the standard kind are both fine.",best toothpaste
