"I've been a huge fan of the Armored Core series up to (before) Armored Core 4.  All of these games were on the PS2 except for the first 3 being on the PS1, one PSP exclusive, and two ports to PSP.

Armored Core 4 and above are on 360 and PS3 if I recall correctly."
"I had to scroll to far to find this.

Pros: Excellent job market, plenty of money in the field for research, internships, etc, and your profs will be enthusiastic.

Cons: Don't expect to be able to ""do"" a whole lot until later in your studies. Most programs cover the most basic possible concepts your first 2 years. You'll start with very simple circuit analysis, very little in design, and basic building blocks for larger circuits. It wasn't until about my junior year that I got to interesting circuits and applications of the digital logic courses I'd taken.

I can answer any specific questions you might have."
"Hey, you should make a Spotify playlist! That worked out so well for everyone last time!"

For me the biggest twist is when they go to the friends house
"My mom used to work as security for the WB in Burbank, California, and she met tons of celebrities during her time there. I think one of her favorites was Lena Headey (300, Terminator TV series, Cersei of GoT). She is absolutely **gorgeous** without makeup, and is a total sweetheart. I believe my mom said they were both in the bathroom washing their hands, and had a nice chat, then met again a few weeks later, and Lena recognized her and came over to say hello.

I believe George Clooney was a bit of a jerk she said, but he left all of his supplies in his office trailer when he was done shooting something with WB, so I am now the proud owner of George Clooney's printer paper.

She once gave a man his parking designation, noting ""You look a lot like Jack Black"". He responded with ""Yeah, I get that a lot"" and handed her his parking pass; Jack motherfuckin Black. Total nice guy.

I'm trying to remember the ones she said were assholes, but I think they were mostly no-names anyway, trying to pull the ""do you know who I am?"" card when they just showed up to the lot without proper authorization. I'll try to find out and edit if this gets any interest this late in the thread.

Edit: Hehe was actually not expecting this amount of interest! It's almost 4am here, so I will update tomorrow for those who asked :)

**Edit 2:** Okay so I talked to my mom today. It's mostly celebs that are nice with a few douches. Lauren Graham from Gilmore Girls is super nice, but Alexis Bledel is a bitch; very demanding on-set and whiny. Clint Eastwood is friggin awesome, and my mom got to drive the car from Gran Torino to a secure parking structure (I'll see if I can find pics). Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer are great guys, very down-to-earth, but the kid is a little shit, even before finding Jesus and condemning the show that gave him notoriety and fame in the first place. 

Michael Rappaport (War at Home and Chepelle's Show) is an asshole, but the kids from the War at Home show are really nice and humble. The daughter from the show was actually feeling like she wasn't very attractive, and my mom cheered her up and gave her some confidence. She actually tried getting me a date with her, but I guess she already had a boyfriend :P The son (also from Malcolm in the Middle) was a big dork but really chill, too.

A client of hers when she had a house-cleaning business is a [costume designer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277472/) for a ton of movies , and also the uncle of Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt is of course a good guy, although apparently doesn't talk to that side of the family much. As for our friend's work, he was fitting a costume for Roseanne (yes, that one) and he asked what she thought of it. Her answer: ""I hate it, it makes me looks fat"". It took all of his willpower to not state the obvious.

I hope none of this sounds like name-dropping, even though it clearly is, but I am simply repeating what I heard from my mom. Hope you guys enjoy."
"Childhoods End. 

Dune.

Hyperion.

Special mention to Banks for starting my now life love of Science Fiction."
"To add to your not-Netflix list, Paprika was a strong inspiration for Inception"
"Bull that it's not on there, it definitely deserves to be in the top 3."
"Hey, congrats! Have fun playing! Any games in particular you have in mind to go through?"
"Thanks so much for your answer, totally agree."
"I would tend to agree with you, but it seems to me that Hutson's name is rarely even brought up in these discussions. He deserves at least that."
"As far as how much candy to give out, when I was a kid it changed from house to house from one piece (which I was fine with especially if it was the good stuff) to whole HANDFULS. Usually the handfuls of candy came from the last houses I went to in my neighborhood who were trying not to get stuck with most of a bowl of candy. 

So if you don't know how many kids are going to show up start out with one piece per kid to be safe and then later in the night when it looks like you might get stuck with 200 pieces of candy start handing out more."
"My father was a dentist (USA retired), his spin on the toothpaste debate... Anything approved by the ADA (American Dental Association, it will have their official logo on the box) has been tested and proven to be effective.  Now keep in mind that it must bear the ""official"" logo. I have seen some Crest ""glamour"" brands with a stylized lookalike ADA logo that is pure malarkey.

Edit: Here is the ADA list to choose from and compare...

i think you meant you turned autocorrect **on** once.
"Sephora offers perfume sample packs! There are a few different options and they come with a coupon for a roller ball or bottle of the perfume if your choice from the samples. This helped me determine that I really strongly prefer light florals on me, no matter how much I want to smell like an amber-scented femme fatale. The samples are enough to wear a few times each, so you can get a sense of the scent when you're in different moods or situations."
Drink a lot of 'Naked' drinks that are super high in Vitamin A and C.
I was going through same choices and got the TUF - loving it so far (first 1440p monitor). Don't think you can wrong with either - just a price / availability screen now.
"Mila Kunis. 

Met her @ a bar in Manhattan several years back (IIRC during the tale end of That 70's Show). My buddy offered to buy her a drink, she turned it down in hilarious fashion. As he went off distraught I chatted with her for a good half hour. Pretty sweet gal."
"Good point - I've only dabbled with Parallels before switching back to Boot Camp because I didn't think it handled games that well. But for programs like Excel that don't need 3D graphics, it may be just fine. It's probably worth a shot, using a virtual machine instead of rebooting every time you need Excel would take away a lot of the hassle."
"This list is skewed heavily towards games I enjoy, but don't love. I would love to be able to put in my own games ranking and see which reviewers I track with the most."

"Why you stopped at Reddit 50 is beyond logic; if a game is going to be a large downfall for us, why would it still have to fall into REDDIT'S top 50? That would require it to be a top 37 game to start with, but not be such a large disparity that it would fall out of top 50. That is so illogical (and still somehow missed Scythe and Blood Rage).

If using BGGs top 50, as logic would dictate, there is 7th Continent, Imperial Assault, Wingspan, Robinson Crusoe, Puerto Rico, Mansions of Madness, Through the Ages, Anachrony, and 7 Wonders which are all top 50 BGG games with bigger drops than TM."
