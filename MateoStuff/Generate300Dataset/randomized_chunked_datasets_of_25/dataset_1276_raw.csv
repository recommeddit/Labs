I’m on chimera 1.0.8 on A12 so Cydia is broken for me. I tried Sileo and it doesn’t have the features that Cydia or zebra have like adding multiple sources at once or the scrubber to quickly scroll through packages. Plus there’s a built in dark mode making it the ultimate package manager. It seems far ahead of sileo not to mention the controversy with Sileo and BigBoss.
"Ha ha, that's the way to do it then, perhaps! I'll try it in my hair sometime instead."
"I mean, if you're not buying the best, what's the point anyways?

[Linda Farrow](https://us.lindafarrow.com/linda-farrow-men) kinda expensive

[Gold and Wood](https://www.gold-and-wood.com/storelocator-en) pretty expensive

[Maison Bonnet](https://www.maisonbonnet.com) really expensive"
"Because WiFi calling is currently only available for Android phones on the GSM LTE network. I feel that is a minority use case, and that US Mobile is actually a better value on the Super LTE network where WiFi calling is not yet supported, so I have chosen to leave WiFi calling off for US Mobile."
"I only use them when I really need them.

* **5 Hour Energy** - This is my favorite. The small size makes it easy to down quickly and I can store them easily. The energy kicks in in about a half hour. It is gradual and effective. I d not get jittery on it, it simply wakes me up. The come down is also gradual.

* **Monster** - I like this for the taste. It provides pretty good energy but it is not as smooth as 5 Hour.

* **Red Bull** - Good balance of flavor and energy. However, I have had panic attacks on this for some reason.

* **Red Jak** - Best tasting I think. I just do not get a very effective energy boost from this one."
"I work for a Home Depot DC,  and it's one of the best jobs I've had. You probably had a shitty GM."
yeah man
Lol what did you expect then?
"Grammarly is in fact free, some more advanced features are paid."
Where's the iDubbbz extension for all thing pretty good on the net
Is there a simple test *I* could do at home?
"Might be kind of a shock but moms are.....people. With all kinds of different interests and hobbies and preferences. 

What does your mom enjoy? What does she do for fun? What kinds of things are she excited about when she buys them? What does she comment about wanting or needing but puts off because she's taking care of other people first?"
I think so and equally if you had lost to City in the quarters I don't think it would be as close
"I could really use some help! The last time I bought a computer or laptop was 15 years ago. I've since gotten hand-me-downs from family members. I need a laptop that's great for school, work, and occasionally gaming such as Skyrim or League of Legends. I can afford around $1000 for initial cost plus or minus for accessories.  I've never owned a Mac but I'm not opposed to it if a one is a better choice/ value than windows. 

Thank you in advance!"
Hunt for the Wilderpeople scratched that itch for me.
"An ex bought this for me, my current SO knows this, so I can never wear it. I have like 3/4 a bottle just waiting for the pending separation."
"The steamed eggs seem to peel much easier than regular boiled ones, especially if you shock them in really cold water. I roll them at the bottom of the ice water bowl firmly to crack the shells all around and peel them underwater. Sometimes there's a tough one but generally it slides right off."
"I wish there was a write-up but I understand why there isn't one. Ignoring all of the off-the-field problems, his play speaks for itself."
And they got Hymns and Mantras
That broke me.
"I'm glad you brought up Hutson. I realize Rice is always considered the best receiver/player of all time, but Hutson was so dominant for his time and essentially created the modern receiver position as we know it. Plus he still holds the record for most seasons and most consecutive seasons leading the league in receptions, yards, and touchdowns. Records I dare say that will never be broken."
"Actually, it's the same boost material, just in different amount. The Ultra is 100% boost cushioning and 0% EVA foam. I don't remember the exact % differences for the other shoes but I think the Boston is ~60% boost with an EVA ""heel bumper"" and forefoot."
">He's not a bad guy but he comes across as shallow sometimes. Or maybe he's always been like this.

Elaborate a bit on this one please."
"A tad more expensive than $150 ($159.99) but I recently purchased a ViewSonic VX2457 - it's a superb monitor, HDMI, sexy picture... pleased with it so much I am going to grab another!"
