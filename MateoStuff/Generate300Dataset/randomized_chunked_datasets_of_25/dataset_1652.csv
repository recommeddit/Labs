If you want a fucked up, non traditional romance novel check out Lolita by Nabokov. Beautifully written.

Prescription glasses are interesting in that most people take their sunglasses off indoors because the shade makes it harder to see. I leave mine on because no matter how dark it is indoors, I can see a tonne better with them. Rude people have commented on it before and then I have to explain that I forgot my regular glasses and can't see if I take my sunnies off.",best sunglasses for fashion
14561,"This is cheating because I responded to the post yesterday with my pick, but I really don't miss an opportunity to recommend these books. Milla Vane's series A Gathering of Dragons fits every almost every request one could make. Do you like romances that feature a pet? We have a saber-tooth tiger, horses, and wolves. Do you like enemies to lovers? What about friends to lovers to enemies to lovers? Both are included! There is even a novella that features fated mates. If you like road trips, Vane has you covered.  If you want an LGBTQ friendly fantasy universe, people can marry whoever they want in this world. 

The only threads that I cannot recommend it to are those asking for children and people who like their romances smut free.",best romantic novel

70027,"As someone that is about to start articling in one week I have a few things to say (keep in mind Canadian experience here). 

1. There is no such thing as pre-law. You are doing an undergrad, there are not specific classes needed to get into law. 

2. My first Torts class the Prof said this to the entire class. ""All of you think you are smart and you probably are smart, relative to the rest of the population, but here half of you are idiots. You are used to getting A's and A+'s, you will now get C's and C+'s. No longer are you the smartest person in a room, you are lucky if you are the 20th smartest person in this room, that's how smart everyone is around you and multiply that by 100 once you get into the actual legal field.""

3. Jobs are super hard to come by, they involve long hours and it's mostly bitch work that real lawyers don't want to do because it bores them.",best major to study in college
