63114,"Oh yeah, I know they do a lot of workshops, I was simply referring to the age of what is up there for past content, not the quality. A lot of stuff is from 2018 or even older, especially for the basic HTML/CSS/Javascript stuff.

The instructor resume is definitely the biggest reason why I signed up... and I definitely hear you about the length of Udemy courses, one of the JS courses I dived into was 60 hours long.

I will say I definitely like the teacher/classroom learning style a lot more than the video watchalongs of places like Udemy. I've only done Jen Kramer's advanced CSS courses so far and I'm pretty excited to jump into Brian Holt's new React workshop after it goes live.",Best online React course

72305,"This was the past. Most filters work on the network level now.

Filters to hide elements are applied too to cover up empty areas left behind by the failed ad. They are considered ""cosmetic"" filters and can be turned off for whatever bizarre reason you might have.

The advantage over DNS level blocking is that it works for sites that deliver ad-code and tracking scripts from their main domain.",best adblocker extension
68466,"I'd agree with that. 

Old Man's War fits in the same place Dresden Files does personally. There are some neat ideas, the world is cool, and the writing gets the point across and is occasionally witty/funny. 

They're the ""summer action movie"" in book form. And they're fun for that.",best science fiction novel
33733,"As it stand right now I wouldn't want an EV. Range can still be an issue, as is charging the cars. I live in the countryside, my town has a grand total of three chargers. None of these are of the high speed kind so getting a full charge will take some patience. Even with superchargers like Tesla you still have to be willing to wait some time, at the risk of your batterylife. 

There is also the issue of how long the battery will last. In the end an EV has the same battery as your phone or laptop. While it will last longer, it will start to degrade. Can an EV live to be 15 years old without needing new batteries? 

If I had to chose I'd think hybrids are better for now. PHEV's just seem like a clunky in between stage.",best electric car
