"They were from shoppee but most likely the same as AliExpress as well. The overall quality is just very poor, as you can see starting from the black one. Catches lint, colours are very bright, and the fit isnâ€™t well made. The bottom cutout is soft instead of rigid, so itâ€™s a bit loose around the speakers and charging port. The silicone is so thin you can see through to the hard case within. Here are some photos to show you what I mean:

No MagSafe for the knockoffs that I tried. Maybe I just got a poor quality batch from a bad seller.

Smartdevil versions are much better made alternatives."
Milk and Honey is my favorite spot for drinks and small plates!
Could you please sketch Comrade Questions?

"For me, constantly being tired tends to be a signal that my body is trying to fight something off.  So if I can take a day and just give in to whatever my body is asking for (ie--sleep whenever I get tired and eat whenever I am hungry), I can usually knock it out before it gets bad and decides to hang around forever.  It usually turns into a whole day of ""sleep for about 3 hours, wake up and eat something, instantly fall back asleep for about 3 hours, wake up and eat something, lather, rinse, repeat"".  But it works!!  

Also, I am a big fan of spicy, garlicky chicken noodle soup.  And detox baths."
"I'll let that slide since it's Christmas. 

\*cough\* Tom Brady sucks... \*cough\*"
"Genuinely amazing that you got to meet him, and 1 to 1 (with your dad) at that. He'll always be a one of a kind for what he achieved so you should feel very lucky to have met him :)"

"I know it's been mentioned but Memento is great.

Vanilla sky is good as well. Haven't seen the spanish original.

Wild things has several plot twists.

Old Boy (korean) is definitely a mindfuck."
"My $30 gymnastics rings. Saved thousands in gym fees over the years. 

Also big thanks to r/bodyweightfitness"
"I know this is one of the main limitations of this idea, but it can also be one of its strenghts: instead of wasting your time reading the same pop-sci articles again and again on /r/science (""scientists invent time travel!), you have the chance to read and learn about what scientists are actually doing. It doesn't matter if you don't understand everything."

"Thank you for doing all of this! It's definitely an interesting way to use the numbers from the Coasterbot poll. Though, shout-out to me living near a home park that has six coasters and ZERO ranked ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Probably the largest park that has nothing ranked in all of the US"
