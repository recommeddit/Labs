"I've tried YNAB and thought it was a great app; however, I like the simplicity of the EveryDollar app.  I can link all my accounts and then the app pulls in transactions from those accounts.  Then I simply slide them over to the appropriate category.  You can also manually add cash transactions, add balances for your debts, track savings, and add goals.  It usually only takes me 5 mins a week to balance the budget."
Anyone know an equivlent for business studies?
I remember some lady giving out rice balls every year
"One thing to look out for with these are outlets with old and loose...holes. But seriously, it seems more often than not US airport outlets are too weak to hold anything heavier than a two-port non-battery charger.

I have a similar sized non-battery 4-port Anker charger that often falls out. At least this one will keep charging your devices from its battery, though."
Verizon is blocking the CDN they're using because the same CDN is hosting actual viruses and phishing sites. You have to use a VPN to get past it
"My initial reaction was why a forbidden game when you put in Pandemic? I like em and all but they are just way to light to last. Especially when you want to play a coop you just bust out pandemic! 

I like the sushi go add and probably the dominion add, but what are your thoughts on Concordia and clank!????? 

I might throw those in personally."
"Nope! Zero seems to be the one that attracts lint, hair, etc, the most."

Extremely annoying as I referenced Dr.Witteman in one of my university (college) assignments and had to use very minimal information because I didnâ€™t want to pay to access the paper ðŸ˜©
Wow the autocorrecr on my phone really sucks
"Youâ€™re saying a lot of idiotic and inaccurate things, and have a terrible attitude about it, calm down.

Mildly acidic water is not as bad as youâ€™re making it out to be. Our stomach acid is way lower in pH, and our blood has plenty of buffers to neutralize any potential change in pH caused by that water.
