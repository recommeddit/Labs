I invented the SCOTTEVEST product line to help make travel easier. Keep your gadgets on you at all times, makes going through security fast and easy (put jacket in bin like normal, leave tech in the pockets!), SAVE $ on baggage fees, and protect valuables from theft!"
66843,best soccer team in the world,"Their Basketball team would be suuuper elite. Could probably compete with the US. Sad that Greece isn't part of that, one physical freak like Giannis in a team made up of elite shooters and passers and they're probably even favorites. That region is seriously underrated when it comes to sports."
11456,best gifts for dad,"My oldest saw me doing a bit of backyard engineering on the lower air dam of my car and asked why I don't ask for a new one for Christmas. I told him I wanted socks. He said he always gets me socks. And I told him that's because I always want socks, so he's doing it right.

BTW: Both my boys say they want socks for Christmas...so they must have turned out OK."

You actually sound like a sickkunt"
12844,best gifts for mom,"How old are your kids? If my experiences are any indicator, this is completely normal behavior for teenagers. Personally, I pretty much wanted nothing to do with my mom when I was a teen. Its not that I didn't love her or that she wasn't a good parent, I just wanted to be left alone to do my own thing. 

Now that I'm older and moved out of the house I spend more time with her than I ever did as a teen. I enjoy going out and spending the day with my mom. I call and talk to her and let her know what's going on with my life. I ask for advice on things and actually listen to what she has to say. Whenever I go back home I'll hang out with her and shoot the shit. 

I guess what I'm saying is, just be the best mother you can and give it some time. They'll come around. Teenagers are assholes (yes, *all* of them) and it takes some time to grow out of that. 

I think this quote sums up everything pretty damn good. Just amend it for mother or parents. 

>When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years."
962,best ice cream flavor,"That was beautiful. As a native Texan, I am much more appreciative of my readily available Blue Bell after reading your story. The only thing that happened to me was when they had to recall all their ice cream for some health issues. People lost it and the moment the ice cream came back on store shelves they were bought up so fast. Shiner is also great, I really like the light blonde!"
65839,best college in california,"From my experience kinda, I got zero aid or grants and my parents couldn't cover everything so I have loans for the rest. But the loans are federal not private, the interest isn't terrible and the amount I took out is manageable I'll be out of debt by 30 on only minimum payments. 

That being said I also finished in 4 years and haven't had to differ my payments at all, I also am kind of a dirty hippie that hates capitalism so I live very frugally anyway.

Also I do know UC tuition is going up despite students best efforts, when I was a student our protest were large but extremely unorganized and the regents kind of ignored us. Also the issues with tuition go back to governor Schwarzenegger so I don't really know the full context of it all."

69266,best major to study in college,"You know, if you think it will translate into significantly better earnings or a better career, it might be worth considering adding on a major and sticking around for another year or two."

22382,best celebrity,"Years ago working hotel security in Edmonton I was escorting Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers at 0400 in the elevator down from their rooms to the lobby to get in their Airport Limo. I am 6’5”, and so I towered over her. Dolly looked me up and down and said in her cute southern drawl “they sure grow ‘em big up here in Canada!” She was just as sweet as you could imagine.

Kenny, on the other hand, and I feel bad for saying this, due to his recent passing, treated me like the help (which I of course was) and even made a huffy impatient noise when, slightly flustered by Dolly’s remark, I struggled to find the key to put the elevator into independent service. Dolly touched my arm, looked me in the eye, and said “Darlin’, don’t you pay him any attention, we appreciate y’all!”

I guess I got the good and the bad in one shot."
