What is difference from 2600 vs 2600x?

What about the thyroid triclosan link? or its reaction with chlorine in water? would you say those are negligable in toothpaste?
what about queen chicago
"You can tell this list wasn't compiled by Sci Fi readers. Far too many books that are average but have name recognition. Do androids dream of electric sheep always makes it on these lists but at best it's an average book, it only makes it because Blade Runner was ""based"" on it (yes those are air quotes)

It's like when you see Gullivers Travels on a list if children's books. They remembered the cartoon but never read the book

Enders Games was a great short story but expanding it to a novel didn't improve it"

"That's the thing though, he wasn't a general. His overall grand strategy ended up working quite well, and that is what we should judge him on, not the failings of commanders under him or not knowing when to replace certain commanders as a non-military man. 

His general strategy which was to blockade the South, divide it in half along the Mississippi, emancipate slaves in the South, focus on capturing Richmond to decapitate the Confederacy and draw valuable resources to its defense, and win diplomatically by keeping Britain and France out of the war, worked as well as any plan likely would have."
"From my experience, this gets better then worse then better. At 18 I was so at odds with my mother we had to communicate through letters for a few weeks. Within a couple years I had to accept myself as an adult before I could begin my adult relationship with her. It was pretty good for awhile, but then I moved out and the pace of life started to catch up. Meanwhile my mother slowed down, stopped watching TV shows, stopped watching movies, and we just didn't have as much in common to talk about. And as my life gets busier, she is retired, but still complains I don't go see her enough, even though she never drops by my house either. It's really not bad, definitely better than at 18 lol. So it will probably get better. You've done almost all you can as a parent, now the children have to accept their adult roles and you have to adjust to seeing them as somewhat more of an equal before you guys can really connect again (obviously a generality). 

Tl:dr probably gets better after a few months or years."
Lucky. You missed the concussion.
I don’t see patchwork-in shrink on here so it isn’t  a valid list ;-)

Haha the last thing I want to do on my vacation is hike. I work industrial construction in work boots all day. I stick to keeping my drukin ass on a beach.
"That's a great pic.  But, I like winter in the Daks the best.  Early breakfast at the diner in Keene.  Doing a warmup run on Chouinard's Gully.  Never new I could have so much fun in -20 degrees fahrenheit.

Now, if we could just figure out how to keep out all those French Canadians?"
Barcelona is too high this is all time not last two decades.
Nice what field are you working in?
After. I’d say Boss is my favorite CCI I’ve ridden so far.
"> The chirping noise is very cute.

To *you.*  Not everyone likes the same things.  Kids singing in commercials makes me want to jam a fork in my ears, yet somehow people keep doing it."
For sure that’s what I was thinking. Do you think I’ll be able to get them all done if I get there before it opens?
"Tl;dr Oral hygiene guide


__-Toothpaste guide__

*""The best toothpaste is the one that you'll use; at the end of the day it is the mechanical disruption of plaque from the toothbrush, floss, ect, that has the biggest impact on both cavity risk and gum health.""*

__-Don't Buy__

Activated charcoal toothpaste. Repeated use (more than once per month) will erode your enamel. Read the label. Slight whitening may be seen due to abrading the enamel.

Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). More and more brands are adding or upping the amount, which is a cheap detergent that can cause an tissue sloughing reaction in some people. It's not harmful in the long term, usually goes away, and most of the time people don't even realize they have it.

Triclosan (eg. in Colgate Total line) has linkages with bacterial resistance and endocrine disruption.

""Whitening toothpastes"" is a cosmetic claim, the manufacturers do not have to provide any proof, and the independent literature has been unable to find any evidence that it has any whitening action.

Hydrogen peroxide, early discussion of a very very small increased cancer risk.


__-Buy__

Novamin™, bioglass which forms a barrier through remineralization that will prevent cavities.

Fluoride >1'000ppm for adults.

Potassium nitrate (for sensitive teeth)



__-Flossing__

*“You only have to floss the teeth you want to keep.”*

If your gums bleed they're infected, floss consistently and bleeding will stop in a week+.

Not okay just popping the floss in an out, best to make a ""C"" shape around each side of the tooth.

Water flosser

Interdental picks



__-Toothbrush guide__

Brush 3 minutes~
Change head every 1-3 months

Electric toothbrush
Pressure sensing and timers=best

Slow back and forth motions, circular motions unnecessary.

Light pressing when brushing, use your wrist for movement/pressure control, rather than fingers.

Manual toothbrush
Circular motions.
It’s the technique that makes a difference. Brush where the gum meets the tooth (front and back) twice a day for 2 mins and in between with interdental brushes/ floss once a day. 



__-Mouthwash__

(preferably with fluoride in) use it 30 mins after brushing or during the day, you don’t want to wash off what you just spent 2 mins putting on!

Do spit after brushing, but rinsing after brushing reduces the fluoride effect. Allows the fluoride to stay in contact with your teeth for a bit longer.


-My Questions:.   


Zinc: whitens, helps immune system, fights bacteria and plaque? https://youtu.be/U1iCZpFMYd0

How effective are Vitamins in toothpaste?

How good is Aronal & Elmex? German morning and night toothpaste.

If there are multiple types of fluoride, many mentioned, what are the best?

Organic fluoride

amine fluoride

Sodium fluoride

Sodium monofluorophosphate

Edit: formatted slightly better"
