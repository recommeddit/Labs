14979,"I feel like every long romance series has a book like Zsadist and Bella.  In the Psy/Changling books it's book #3 Caressed by Ice.  The basic premise is seriously damaged hero who the heroine falls in love with and she has to work her ass off to win him over because he feels like he's too damaged.  Though with the Psy/Changling books you do need to read book 2 because it leads into book 3.  However, several of the books in the series might be a good match like Heart of Obsidian or Kiss of Snow.  


If you're really into tortured heroes then The League series by Sherrilyn Kenyon is perfect.  Every hero goes through a horrific childhood and is unloved and betrayed by those closest to him.  Also, there's always a scene where someone/many people who don't like the hero get their comeuppance or find out that they acted crappily.",best romantic novel

If you're looking for a more family centered event (with minimal scares or less strobe lights, which is a big thing for me) there's of course the Disney Parks, but I've heard HersheyPark is cool too, since they do some special things to some rides and don't really have scarezones or houses (And I'm actually going to their Halloween event this year).",best amusement park
