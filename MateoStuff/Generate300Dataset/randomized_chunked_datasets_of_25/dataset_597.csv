63081,Best online React course,I've just started the navigation section and I'm loving it. Some say Redux should not be taught but I was able to understand everything quite well. Stephen is a great communicator.
17284,best iOS game,"[Life is Strange ](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/life-is-strange/id1180101534?l=en) and [Life is Strange : Before the Storm ](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/life-is-strange-before-storm/id1293250289?l=en) ( Life is Strange Prequal ) 
Both free with 12.99$ for all episodes"
14979,best romantic novel,"I feel like every long romance series has a book like Zsadist and Bella.  In the Psy/Changling books it's book #3 Caressed by Ice.  The basic premise is seriously damaged hero who the heroine falls in love with and she has to work her ass off to win him over because he feels like he's too damaged.  Though with the Psy/Changling books you do need to read book 2 because it leads into book 3.  However, several of the books in the series might be a good match like Heart of Obsidian or Kiss of Snow.  


If you're really into tortured heroes then The League series by Sherrilyn Kenyon is perfect.  Every hero goes through a horrific childhood and is unloved and betrayed by those closest to him.  Also, there's always a scene where someone/many people who don't like the hero get their comeuppance or find out that they acted crappily."

23856,best car racing video game,"For close to sim-racing you're options are pretty lacking on Switch. Check out GRID Autuosport as that is probably the best, especially if you want to race against other cars. If you're OK with racing without other people then the WRC games are fantastic and allow tons of customization. But it's only rally racing and you don't race against other drivers."

16803,best pet for toddlers,"Cats provide companionship and affection, a belly to scratch, a responsive meow or purr, a buddy to curl up with on the couch, a friend to play with, etc. Cats are wonderful in their own way, and honestly it sounds like you could enjoy one very much."
53434,best usb c charging cable,"Don’t buy shitty USB C hubs off Amazon too! 90% of them are wholesale crap which breaks easily and overheats. Stick with Anker, Belkin, Satechi"
37400,best amusement park,"Depends on what you're looking for in a Halloween event. Best haunted houses and scares are usually at HHN at Universal (Orlando is usually better, but Hollywood is good too). If you're looking for a more family centered event (with minimal scares or less strobe lights, which is a big thing for me) there's of course the Disney Parks, but I've heard HersheyPark is cool too, since they do some special things to some rides and don't really have scarezones or houses (And I'm actually going to their Halloween event this year)."

32610,best vacation resort,We just got back from the Andaz Maui. Opened in Sept 2013 so less than 1 year old. Spectacular views. Management even left a bag filled with jams on our door when we asked where we could buy that brand. Now that's taking care of your guests!
17627,best iOS game,I play COD and Brawl Stars and they set it up so it’s not really Pay to Win. Fair games lots of free loot boxes. Good fun all around. More so BS than COD.
