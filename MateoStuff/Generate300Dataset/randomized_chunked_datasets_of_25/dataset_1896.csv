But, if you're really on a budget and not looking to get anything really crazy it might be worth checking out second hand places like craigslist, ebay, etc. Many people were selling monitors that you described for often super cheap.

If you're looking to wear them in cloudy conditions you might be better off with the green, though.

13881,"Grave Shortcomings, Gargett et al 1989.  Great article on the reinterpretation of supposed Neandertal ritual behavior, notably burials.  Hence the cool title.  In addition to being an interesting and accessible topic, it is a fantastic illustration of things that influence all scientific literature and the value of critical thinking and balancing different hypotheses in general.  In this case, some previous conclusions (that neandertals had various examples of ritualistic behavior including burying their dead) were influenced by the social and political environment in which they were written, among other things.  Gargett takes another look and some of the most famous examples, and alternately applies various hard sciences and occam's razor to dispute some of the original findings.  There are plenty of peer responses, as this was in Current Anthropology.  Anyway, I haven't read it for 10+ years, and I don't even recall agreeing with all of it, but it should be helpful to discuss ALL sorts of topics related to scientific literature.

33797,"Least favourite are Black and White, and Moon and Sun. The characters are boring (i didn't loved a particular character, like, for example Silver, Lance, Steven), and the most of the nice 6th/7th gen Pokemons are available at late game, i don't enjoy using my fav pokemons just for beating Pokemon League (i'm not a huge fan of battle front or online, in general).

(I havent play 8th gen games) 

My favourites Pokemon games are
1. Platinum: 
I liked: The Sinnoh mythology, Characters (ie Cynthia, definitely my fav Pokemon Champ), soundtrack, variety of pokemons (even if its actually a generation that lacks from variety in types, to he honest). The difficulty curve is accurate and the gym battles are challenging. 
Things that I didnt like: The abuse of HM requirements in some areas (literally i had to fill 2 slots in my team with pokemons with 2 or 3 HMs to complete Victory Road and Mt Coronet), the lack from variety in pokemon types, Team Galaxy (boring), the lack of areas for leveling up before the league... And of course, the fking location of Rock-climbing HM. 

2. Soul Silver: 
-I liked: Characters (Silver, Lance, Claire), references to other (gen 4 and gen 1) games, the available Pokemons at early game (I got Dratini before the 2th badge! Even if it costed me like 2 hours in that fucking card game), Legendaries (Lugia, Raikou), the majesty of the Dragons (the most powerful and wise trainers are asociated with dragons; Lance is really imponent as a dragon trainer), the elite four and champion...and of course, Red (when i first played the game I really didnt expected that)
-didnt like: Its really difficult to catch some Pokemons, the team Rocket its particullary boring in this game, the fucking islands of Lugia, and maybe the difficulty curve before the Pokemon League and Red.

3. Emerald.
It was my first pokemon game. I have good memories but i haven't play it for years, so, i can be objective. Its a personal preference because of nostalgia :)",best Pokemon game
