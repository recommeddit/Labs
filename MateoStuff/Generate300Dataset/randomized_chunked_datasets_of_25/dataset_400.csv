54089,best medicine for a cold,"I usually blow my nose out, as often I can when it's in the ""running"" phase which lasts for three days max. Though your nose will turn red and sore from it, do not swallow any phlegm that you cough up. spit it out immediately. All that blowing will make you dehydrated, so remember to drink water.

If you clear your nose and throat a lot during the initial days, I've found the cold to vanish much faster. and of course, drink only warm water."
69320,best major to study in college,I don't understand why people say CS is so much more profitable than Mech E's. The average Mech E makes way more than the average CS graduate. Sure they make more in Silicon Valley but engineers make a lot more in Houston or Calgary as well.
49124,best gaming monitor,"i like the ROG swift PG279Q

30507,best Mexican war to study,"Texas independence was recognized by Britain, France and the USA and even Spain .... Mexico crossing to seize back lost territories was invasion of a sovereign border.

When the USA annexed Mexico; the border clashes were no longer tolerated and to boot the US had its sights on expansion; the War with Mexico made logical sense even if consider the issues that plagued Mexico through 1919.

And the Mexican American War wouldn’t be Mexico’s last invasion from the USA or a foreign power."

17801,best Kardashian,Khloe and Kylie I know people hate Kylie but I don’t even know why??? For being traumatised?? She comes across as just living in a bubble but to be fair I think Kylie is so uniquely traumatised by her life experiences that she couldn’t relate to anyone else in the world. She seems sweet enough and mostly just stays in her own lane and drops sexy selfies on her Instagram

11652,best gifts for dad,I wouldn't say he uses them all the time but one father's day my Dad was stuck in the hospital getting one of his hernias removed. I was like maybe 9 and I thought he was going to die for some reason. We didn't have a lot of money at the time so i stole some rubber bands from the dollar store and made my dad some rubber band balls.i don't think he knows this but In the middle of the balls I put a piece of paper that listed all the reasons I loved him and how he was the greatest dad. I gave him about 5 of the each varying in different sizes. he has them on his desk at home and sometimes I'll see him just messing around with them when he's bored.
73805,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I bought the PaperLike matte screen protector but I also bought the iPad to use for school (taking notes and etexts), Kindle, and digital drawing. I really like it and it made such a difference with the Apple Pencil. I haven’t really noticed any problems when watching Netflix or YouTube. Also, as a bonus, PaperLike actually sends you two screen protectors when you order one."
