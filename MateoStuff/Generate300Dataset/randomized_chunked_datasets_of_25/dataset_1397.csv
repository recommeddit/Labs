16695,best pet for toddlers,"Agreed.

When my son was in kindergarten, somebody had the bright idea for two of the classes (one of them being my son's) to have a shared ""class pet"". In this case, it was a dwarf rabbit..very cute, white with black eyeliner.

Every kid had to take the thing home for at least one weekend and when it was our weekend, my son was too afraid of the thing to feed it, etc. So I tried to feed it and the damn thing would attack my hand every time I tried to get near the food bowl.

I hate rabbits.

Unless they're being made into stew. Then they're OK."

123,best terminal file manager reddit,"I don't think it was the number of the files. iirc, in preview mode, as you go down a file list file by file, it opens files to get info and shows a spinner on top. Sometimes, randomly it is doesn't close that process/thread and the spinner goes on indefinitely."

65465,best phone service company,Fantastic job.  Something I always wonder with MVNO pricing is if the taxes and fees are built into the advertised rate or if they are tacked on later.  It would be AMAZING if this could be added to your chart.
25472,best cricket teams of all time,"Aus cause of the Don, then WI and then India very close behind WI.

Warner and Haydos as an opening combo... brutal. Softens them up for the Don. Then fucking Ponting and Smith to follow. Then after that carnage in walks Gilly. Bowlers would cry. I'd definitely grab Keith Miller as the all rounder. He was talented at just about everything.

Reason I pick WI over India is because of Lara. He may not be as consistent as Tendulkar, but every once in a while he would just get in these moods and make absolutely mammoth scores. Biggest propensity for big scores I've ever seen in cricket. Was impossible to dismiss on his day. Also, there's a few batsman for WI who I am surprised were left out, Everton Weekes and Conrad Hunte should be in there too, I reckon.

India's side listed is pretty much who I would have picked. Sehwag would be an awesome foil for Sunny, I would really have liked to watch their different approaches while batting together."
54394,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Um, imo they are kinda over rated. It's not gonna make u a pro. $70 for a mousepad tho is kinda steep. I would get somin else like from xray pad or idk any mousepad. I would be guessing your getting one because of durability, hien for the look, or because u have nothing else to upgrade in your setup. So not really worth it"
