16695,"Agreed.

When my son was in kindergarten, somebody had the bright idea for two of the classes (one of them being my son's) to have a shared ""class pet"". In this case, it was a dwarf rabbit..very cute, white with black eyeliner.

Every kid had to take the thing home for at least one weekend and when it was our weekend, my son was too afraid of the thing to feed it, etc. So I tried to feed it and the damn thing would attack my hand every time I tried to get near the food bowl.

I hate rabbits.

25472,"Aus cause of the Don, then WI and then India very close behind WI.

Warner and Haydos as an opening combo... brutal. Softens them up for the Don. Then fucking Ponting and Smith to follow. Then after that carnage in walks Gilly. Bowlers would cry. I'd definitely grab Keith Miller as the all rounder. He was talented at just about everything.

Reason I pick WI over India is because of Lara. He may not be as consistent as Tendulkar, but every once in a while he would just get in these moods and make absolutely mammoth scores. Biggest propensity for big scores I've ever seen in cricket. Was impossible to dismiss on his day. Also, there's a few batsman for WI who I am surprised were left out, Everton Weekes and Conrad Hunte should be in there too, I reckon.

India's side listed is pretty much who I would have picked. Sehwag would be an awesome foil for Sunny, I would really have liked to watch their different approaches while batting together.",best cricket teams of all time
