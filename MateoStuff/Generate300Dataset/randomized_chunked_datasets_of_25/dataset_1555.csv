Due to the lack of the possibility of installing a home charger, and the range of my trip exceeding most (if not all?) EVs it is not practical for me.

If it were a better fit I'd probably at least consider one (before we talk about price anyway)",best electric car
47248,"Ok, so they don't announce the full schedule until late April so I would wait until then and then go on NFL.com.  If you are going to be in that area you previously mentioned the closest team will be the Tennessee Titans.  There are a few other teams in that area like the Saint Louis Rams or if you wanted to stop by Washington DC they have a team there as well.

If you have anymore questions before then or want the game explained to you I would direct you to r/NFL.  One of the best subreddits out there.  Everyone is super helpful and loves expanding the fan base.",best state to visit in the United States

as for your question, i thought that mark twain's joan of arc was a wonderful adventure novel. the portrait it paints of 15th century france and its struggles is wonderful imo, and twain's prose does a really good job of keeping you immersed in joan's journey.",best action and adventure novel series
12797,"My step mom has been in my life since I was 9 after my dad divorced my mom. Now I am 21 years old and I probably have a closer relationship with her than with my dad. She's always there for me and caring for me whereas my dad is... well a dad. Recently, the company I was interviewing with had a screw up and went MIA for a week and a half and she was the one who'd call once every few days to ask me about the progress and reassure me that everything is going to be fine.
Last Christmas I gave her a Christmas card telling how much I love her as much as a real mother and all that mushy stuff from the depths of my heart. She told me it made her cry so I guess that's good... right? 

I guess all I'm trying to say is that your step-kids definitely know how much you care for them and love them. They might not talk to you about it because it's really awkward but they love you just as much as you love them. And you'd never know, they might just surprise you this mother's day :)",best gifts for mom

33419,"Ram will more than likely be the last brand to offer a full EV. FCA (fuck stellantis) is behind the big 3 with EV development. Their saving grace is that EV tech is being designed in Europe for Fiat, Maserati, and PSA.

Once FCA gets their feet under them with the technology and can turn a profit, expect Ram to poach some tech to keep fighting Ford and GM. Ram already has some interesting hybrid technology on the docket for their trucks and Jeeps, so it won't be too far off.",best electric car
