44725,"A corded DeWalt drill, I think I paid $40 almost 20 years ago and I was never particularly careful with it, and I use it all the time around the house or when helping friends. Because it is corded it will not die when batteries are too expensive to replace or discontinued.

And a good soldering station, although under $100 was because it was used. The number of times you can solder something back or replace a cheap component instead of throwing it away, it pays for itself.",best items under $100

In my experience, if we actively give you nothing to worry about, you just freak yourselves out thinking we're hiding something from you.

His best acting performance divides opinions massively - but I'd say Deewar (from the 70s) will be a good watch. As an American, it should be a great summary of Amitabh's angry young man phase as well as a good summary of what Bollywood is all about. Happy viewing.",best bollywood actor
