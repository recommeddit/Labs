11926,best gifts for dad,My dad went crazy for socks with right/left markers on them.
15021,best romantic novel,"Her Name In The Sky made me cry like a baby.

Tipping The Velvet is absolutely fucking evil.

Both 10/10, you'll like the pain."
41010,best instrument to play,"Lol, AC/DC ain't that high of a standard."
8582,best toothpaste,"I read on my package of Trident(R) gum that chewing it after eating helps clean and protect teeth.

I'm going to be chewing it anyways but as long as you're here: how true is that?  Is it just because the gum grabs little bits of leftover food?"
44725,best items under $100,"A corded DeWalt drill, I think I paid $40 almost 20 years ago and I was never particularly careful with it, and I use it all the time around the house or when helping friends. Because it is corded it will not die when batteries are too expensive to replace or discontinued.

And a good soldering station, although under $100 was because it was used. The number of times you can solder something back or replace a cheap component instead of throwing it away, it pays for itself."
71025,best movies with a cool twist,From what years?
55260,best places to hike in the east coast,"I'm doing the Loyalsock Trail in PA at the end of the month.  Website is outdated design-wise, but seems to have accurate info.  Facebook group is active and all trail reviews have been great.  I'm excited!  I'm planning on 5 days, but I think it could be done in 4 pretty easily if that didn't include any driving."
43525,best items under $100,"A 10 foot charging cable 

Or a quality pair of shoes"
27406,best bollywood actor,"All I can say is Hrithik, Aamir, SRK, Akshay are good while Ajay is okay. Salman is average"
482,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,Try OpenBoard ([https://openboard.ch/index.en.html](https://openboard.ch/index.en.html)). It works really well: you can easily import/export pdfs and the pressure sensitivity is good.
12680,best gifts for mom,"> don't give us moms anything more to worry about.

In my experience, if we actively give you nothing to worry about, you just freak yourselves out thinking we're hiding something from you.

You react worse to peace and quiet than you do to mayhem and madness; just saying :P"
68693,best science fiction novel,"First book I read to get back into reading, Amazing read"
17600,best iOS game,They fix bugs and stuff. Might add set effects every once and a while. But it’s dead. It’s been dead for a long time unfortunately.
5425,best home improvement store,"Home Depot - because that's what my family went to, and until recently, there wasn't a Lowe's anywhere near me."
33702,best electric car,"They're alright, I guess"
71242,best movies with a cool twist,"Did the same with my little brother a few years back. Was super fun watching the shock on his face and seeing him put the pieces together.

On the same note, I have to emphasize how much that movie stands up on it’s own as absolutely fantastic even if you know how it ends, unlike other well known “big twist” movies"

42785,best detective show,"Seen it! Crazy twist at the end, I loved it."
27475,best bollywood actor,"Not seen this or the original but I hope you enjoy it. I've heard good things about it. 

His best acting performance divides opinions massively - but I'd say Deewar (from the 70s) will be a good watch. As an American, it should be a great summary of Amitabh's angry young man phase as well as a good summary of what Bollywood is all about. Happy viewing."
