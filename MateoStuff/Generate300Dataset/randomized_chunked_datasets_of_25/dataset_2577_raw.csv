"Scientists tend to get a lot of e-mails from cranks (though how bad it is depends on the field - you really have to feel for climate scientists), so you have to watch that you don't say anything that might set off their ""crank"" instinct. Use an institutional e-mail account if you have one, don't start the e-mail by describing your new theory, keep the message short and simple.

Even then, some people are just busy, don't use e-mail well, have strict filters, or don't know they're allowed to share pre-prints."
The 3.0 looks like its the closest you can get to the vibram feel (with Nike's) I've heard the new model is pretty darn light.
"The one which offers highest graphics and frame rate first, that's my gaming desktop.

However some games are forever exclusives, so PS4 and Switch for those.

I'll usually wait a few years before playing an exclusive game on the chance that it gets ported. Plus by then a lot of patches and quality of life improvements should have happened."

"Yep. I'd rather not have a dozen lines of base code just to do a request, and I'd rather not maintain my own package. So that's why I like Axios!

But I see what you're saying about a wrapper providing the benefit of being able to swap it out with anything. I've done something like that in an app I'm working on:

Wrapper:

    import axios from 'axios';
    
    // Use an instance of Axios.
    const client = axios.create({
      baseURL: '/api'
    });
    
    // Set default options for the HTTP client used to interact with this app's API.
    client.defaults.withCredentials = true;
    client.defaults.headers.common['Content-Type'] = 'application/json';
    
    export default client;

Usage:

    import { appRestApiClient } from '../services';
    
    try {
      const response = await appRestApiClient.get('/some/url');
      const { someValue } = response;
    
      return someValue;
    }
    catch (error) {
      // Handle the error.
      // ...
    }"

"Yeah, a Jersey beach town is definitely the highlight of the state. My vote is for Cape May. A lot of people forget about it so it's a lot less crowded and it's adorably quaint, with historic houses built around the end of the 19th century into the early 20th century."

To get good gear make sure level scaling is equal to yours or even higher and don't bother too much by the standard enemies. Go after bounty hunters or named enemies for the better stuff. Side missions usually get you good stuff.

"theres no jump from raybans to oliver peoples lmao, theyre both just luxicotta with different labels slapped on top. same with persol, oakley, and most of the other brands mentioned in this thread.

unless youre buying from specialty brands like linda farrow, mykita, kuboraum, and a couple others, its just the same shit with a different label, the only difference is how much the name on the sides markup is worth."
