3279,best webcamera,"Isn't a steam deck basically a bunch of buttons you can bind stuff to? So you can do like quick screen transitions, sounds bits, emote sets, etc. If I'm not mistaken on functionality of course.

Which basically means it's mostly convenience or entertainment purposes afaik"
52472,best hiphop album,Graduation is definitely one of his best with College Dropout coming in with a close second.
54809,best water filter,Never heard of that
71374,best movies with a cool twist,The matrix. The others.

53716,best medicine for a cold,"Like duct tape, pho is the answer to everything."
58516,best cologne,"Buy one that is the best match for you!  If I were a man, I would buy this set ($50): http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P299442&categoryId=C19973&shouldPaginate=true

It's a great deal, and you can figure out which one you like best.  Some good scent advice is to use the one that sort of blends in after 15 minutes.  If you can't smell it on yourself, it is a good match to your natural scent.  Do it up right!

It comes with a voucher to get a fullsized bottle, and it does include Acqua Di Gio, so you would probably be saving money if that was your final choice."
42344,movies like Inception,"Watching the movie the second time is a whole different experience.  Little hints get dropped here and there, which one overlooks the first time.  And the whole Marla business takes a very different cast..."
23465,best car racing video game,You all should join r/NFSU2. Let's make it active again.

I have heard rats are pretty good pets. I’ll look into that thanks!"
14392,best romantic novel,Simple Wild was the last book I finished and I really liked it!
73092,best Linux distro,"I've only been using Manjaro for about a year now. I first installed Manjaro Gnome version on my MacBook Air (2011) as Apple quit supporting it. I then got ehe PineBook Pro which came pre-loaded with Manjaro KDE. Liking the KDE version better than Gnome, I replaced it on the MBA. 
Last week, I have replaced Mint 20 with Manjaro KDE after experiencing several annoying issues, not to mention a lot of crap laying around in the filesystem, that suggested it was time to reload. I am running the trsting branch on my daily driver and PineBook Pro, and stable on the MacBook Air. The ability to switch between stable/testing/unstable was a big selling feature. The hardware enablement and newer kernel support than what is offered by Mint / Ubuntu, was also an influential factor. Aside from that, I'm really liking what the KDE team has accomplished over the past 7-8 years."
42594,best detective show,"Thirded!

Great show"
25645,best cricket teams of all time,"Quote from the author in the comments

""That is where the 100 Test streak between 1453(1999) and 1857(2008) is probably the more devastating and more unbeatable sequence. Those 100 Tests had a RAAPP average of 63.066: the equivalent of winning every match by 7 wickets or by 200+ runs. That, to me is, Bradmanesque.

Thats Gilchrist's career right there.

Fuck I love Gilly"
29683,best game console,"[PS2] : Persona 3, Persona 3 FES, Persona 4 ( i know Persona 4 Golden is flat out way better but still...)"
57442,best water brand,Agreed. Surprised this isn’t higher.  Kirkland is even more unbearable than Dasani. Weird because I thought I didn’t mind Kirkland a while back.

12609,best gifts for mom,Fuck you kid. I used to be able to sleep till noon. Then I had you and you never slept and always woke up before dawn. Now I’m writing this at 5am and will take great joy in waking you up for school.
52468,best hiphop album,For me it's Illmatic. Close 2nd would be Moment of Truth. At this point Gang Starr had reached a level close to perfection. Even the featurings are one point on this one.
