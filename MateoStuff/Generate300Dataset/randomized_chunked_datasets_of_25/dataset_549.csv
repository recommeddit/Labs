It's a great deal, and you can figure out which one you like best.  Some good scent advice is to use the one that sort of blends in after 15 minutes.  If you can't smell it on yourself, it is a good match to your natural scent.  Do it up right!

It comes with a voucher to get a fullsized bottle, and it does include Acqua Di Gio, so you would probably be saving money if that was your final choice.",best cologne

73092,"I've only been using Manjaro for about a year now. I first installed Manjaro Gnome version on my MacBook Air (2011) as Apple quit supporting it. I then got ehe PineBook Pro which came pre-loaded with Manjaro KDE. Liking the KDE version better than Gnome, I replaced it on the MBA. 
Last week, I have replaced Mint 20 with Manjaro KDE after experiencing several annoying issues, not to mention a lot of crap laying around in the filesystem, that suggested it was time to reload. I am running the trsting branch on my daily driver and PineBook Pro, and stable on the MacBook Air. The ability to switch between stable/testing/unstable was a big selling feature. The hardware enablement and newer kernel support than what is offered by Mint / Ubuntu, was also an influential factor. Aside from that, I'm really liking what the KDE team has accomplished over the past 7-8 years.",best Linux distro

""That is where the 100 Test streak between 1453(1999) and 1857(2008) is probably the more devastating and more unbeatable sequence. Those 100 Tests had a RAAPP average of 63.066: the equivalent of winning every match by 7 wickets or by 200+ runs. That, to me is, Bradmanesque.
