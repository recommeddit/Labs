26975,"I doubt strongly that a new hobbyist would be able to understand and enjoy Terraforming Mars. Terraforming Mars isn't a gateway game OR a next step game. It's a solidly middle-weight game, that is long, has some fiddly upkeep, and lots of symbology. 

The first games in the top 20 that I would show a newer gamer would be 7 Wonders Duel, Viticulture, Concordia, and The Castles of Burgundy.",best board games

56383,"The ""Holy Grail"" would be something with FALD, but those are generally not 1440p. You have the Asus PG35VQ, which is a 1440p ultra wide, but it is a VA and does have some black smear.

Outside of 1440p you have the PG27UQ and the (soon the be released) PG32UQX. Those are quite expensive however (The PG32UQX will be $3k). 

If all of that is too much to bay, then The G7 is probably the best bet of the ""good but under absolute premium"" market.",best desktop monitor

Speaking as someone who works at a public health clinic - you can take as many free condoms as you want from me.

We have different brands, types, styles, etc.

* Extra strength (for when you want to get a little rough)
* Extra sensitive (if you want to have a good cry after)
* Multi-colored (in case you want to make rainbows)
* Tuxedo-style (because everyone looks good in black)
* Extra large
* 'Snug' fit
* Non-latex
* Flavored (banana, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, cola, grape, mint)
* Reality/Female/Insertive condoms
* Dental Dams
* Studded
* Ribbed
* Extra lubricated
* Etc.

Never ever buy condoms unless it's 3 AM and you can't get any anywhere else. And even if it's 3 AM, just go to a gay bar - we throw entire boxes at those places. (Clarification: by 'boxes' I mean 'boxes full of hundreds or thousands of condoms,' not the tiny little box that has like 5 in it)

Walk into my clinic and you can walk out with a year's supply. I've sent people off with grocery bags full.",best items under $100
