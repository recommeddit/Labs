Why do you need butter if you've got avocado? It's like fruit butter.
"I'm a big fan of Czar and the project felt very rushed together to me. Particularly, I thought the production was just OK in comparison compared to the last one they did along with the overall chemistry.

Deck was a weak point for me, and I like Eso but he doesn't do enough for me to carry a track himself most of the time. I think the bar set by their past work is what gets me though. It's not bad, I just have little desire to replay it when I feel their 2013-2018 stuff does the zany comic book rap style better for me."
">No they didn't. They maintained the blockade until the end of the war. And their blockade was just as illegal

It was a violation of the US's neutral rights, but the British weren't the ones killing American citizens and destroying their property. That was Germany.

>not really. the deal was that IF the US declared war then Germany would make an alliance with Mexico.

In other words they tried to entice a war between the US/Mexico, as the Germans were aware that they were annoying the US quite a bit with their use of submarines."
"Busch Gardens, Florida, US.

Alton Towers, Staffordshire, UK."
Its really interesting but I found it very difficult to focus on the was it was made!
"Thanks, that was interesting. A bit uncomfortable, given how much justification he felt he had to do about the 'data stealing' question. Clearly still defensive about it 50 years later!

He says at 38 mins in (IIRC) that the RNA thing was a mistake, and that it would only have been slightly different."
Give him some time... He has just started
"Atlantis in the Bahamas is amazing. Great location , amazing hotel and grounds and awesome water park"
"Thatâ€™s weird? I still see it on mobile and web, are you using a mobile client?"
The Thirteenth Floor (1999)
"If you're willing to go 6 and a half hours away, the easy answer is Cedar Point.

King's Dominion is a solid choice also from what I hear."
"Down the Rabbit Hole is, in [Fredrik Knudsen's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbWcXB0PoqOsAvAdfzWMf0w/featured) own words, ""A series of videos diving deep into those strange parts of the internet as well as confounding and absurd elements of history""

he does an amazing job and you should check out his videos, very informative and entertaining, and a great way to learn about things you probably have never heard of

if you have heard of them, he adds so much more to the videos so there's always something more to learn"
"I've been using the North Face Jester ever since my Herschel broke. I'm a university student who commutes to school on a motorcycle and it's perfect for my needs.

I usually have a 13 inch laptop, a few A5 notebooks/binded notes/folder and a 1l Nalgene bottle in the main compartment. Small miscellaneous stuff in the small one. I love that the small pocket has mini compartments so I can organise my stuff. Been using the bag for a year or so and it hasn't shown any signs of wear and tear. The back is nicely cushioned too, and the black matched with everything. So I'd say go for it!"
The local army navy store has it but I'm pretty sure it's available on Amazon for $20-30!
"If you want one of the best football experiences I'd say go to Seattle, WA.  Their fans aren't called ""The Twelfth Man"" for nothing. It's a blast.  I went there to visit my grandparents and it's a really cool place too. Lots of cool stuff, the Space Needle being one of the big ones.  It's also not going to cost you an arm and a leg like CA or NYC."
"Imagine Chocolate chip, but the chocolate is drizzled into the ice cream, so it like like elongated drops.  It's a wonderful flavor of gelato (which is not ice cream)."
Well I'm still waiting for the ps5 and Xbox series x or whatever Microsoft is calling it. There is one game that is only worth for me to get Sony and that is god of war but sadly Sony doesn't support backwards comparability that's such a dick move. How far back is Xbox game comparability.
And this is why no one takes NME seriously anymore.
"Well, thank you a lot for all that, really, it helps me understand a lot more how things works in Canada!"
I watched a video and the guy said the password on most is like 0000 or something like that no joke
"My coworker is a teller and he has a MBA from University of Phoenix. Usually with a MBA, one instantly becomes a branch manager or regional manager."
Its basically enter the gungeon but with its own spin.
"For a carry on? Doesn't really matter. Someone can pop the zipper with a pen and they're in. For checked? Depends, are you traveling domestically and want to travel with a firearm? Then you can use an actual hard sided case with an actual lock, otherwise, again it doesn't matter because you can only use a TSA lock."
"Women seem to always like the colognes that smell like food. Hints of vanilla, or fruity smells. So things like Fahrenheit and Joop tend to be popular. I myself HATE smelling fruity or like food, so I tend to go for Cartier or even CK One..and then get no compiments."
Shutter Island! Mindfucked me with its twist
