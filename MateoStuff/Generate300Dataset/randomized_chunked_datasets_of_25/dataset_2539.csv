25825,"That's another non-numbers argument for Aus 00s over 80s Windies. Just the incredible **depth**. 

Sudden crop of injuries,? Missing two batsmen with career 40+ test batting averages? Here's two more coming into the squad, both still above 40 average. 


Warne's injured? Here's Stuart Magill, the second best leg spinner in the world. I'd kill to have Magill available for the current Australian test team.

Gilchrist is out? Here's Brad Haddin, still a legit as hell batsmen and keeper.


I didn't mention Clarke and he did come into the team very late into their period of absolute dominance. But he can hold up as an all time great imho too. Michael Bevan, with the bat. Stuart Clark with the ball. The list of cricketers who were legitimately very very good, could have walked into any other test team in the world but just couldn't keep a spot in that team, because it was so goddamn stacked is ridiculous. It might be a product of time but that's something I don't hear about the Windies.

5042,"In my area HD has a much more modern self check out system. You just grab the gun and scan away, without even removing stuff from your cart.

Lowes on the other hand still has the self checkout system that makes you put everything on their scale/bagging area after you scan it. Try buying a few loose nuts and bolts that practically weigh nothing and dont register anything on their scale, you will be there forever. Item is in the bagging area it just doesnt fuckin weigh anything. Then the cashier comes over hits a few buttons to make the system ignore the scale and it works for the 1 item and then they walk away... but, but I still have 30 more nuts to scan and I have to wait for her to come back 30 more times. This was right after I watched a guy going around their flooring section for 15 minutes shouting ""hello, does anyone work here?"" 

Fuck Lowe's. HD all the way.

Either way whenever I'm doing the self checkout my mind always goes back to Bill Burr's rant about the self checkout at grocery stores.",best home improvement store
