33888,best Pokemon game,"Mystery dungeon explorers of the sky is my all time absolute favorite pokemon game, it had great gameplay, a deep engaging storyline and  brilliant characters. It is absolutely a Must Play in my opinion"
7478,best laptop for general use,"Thank you. I would go with the Acer Swift X on my list. It has a dedicated graphics card, unlike most other options on my list. It would be an excellent choice for games like CS:GO and photo editing."
1593,best ice cream flavor,"Iron Chef America folks often times try their hands at turkey ice cream, and such, and the judges *never* like it. Shrug. I'll try anything once. Almost."
25825,best cricket teams of all time,"That's another non-numbers argument for Aus 00s over 80s Windies. Just the incredible **depth**. 

Sudden crop of injuries,? Missing two batsmen with career 40+ test batting averages? Here's two more coming into the squad, both still above 40 average. 


Warne's injured? Here's Stuart Magill, the second best leg spinner in the world. I'd kill to have Magill available for the current Australian test team.

Gilchrist is out? Here's Brad Haddin, still a legit as hell batsmen and keeper.


I didn't mention Clarke and he did come into the team very late into their period of absolute dominance. But he can hold up as an all time great imho too. Michael Bevan, with the bat. Stuart Clark with the ball. The list of cricketers who were legitimately very very good, could have walked into any other test team in the world but just couldn't keep a spot in that team, because it was so goddamn stacked is ridiculous. It might be a product of time but that's something I don't hear about the Windies.

Edit: Andrew Symonds!"

16111,best sunglasses for fashion,"I've got a pair from aooko and one of the hinge screws fell out within six weeks. When I asked for a replacement they told me to buy a new one and offered $5 off. Service isn't great. I can't recommend them. I would, however, suggest another seller called Vincent. Look him up."
9514,best toothpaste,"That guy is a jerk, but his son can DANCE"
46582,best trick or treating candy,Milk duds can suck my cock and balls and nuts.
65887,best college in california,"Honestly, public schools are great and all. I'm a UC graduate. But going to a private school for graduate programs can very often help you advance your career unlike at a public school. There are just so many resources available to you that come with the high tuition, and having the USC name alone on your resume is a plus."
56037,best action and adventure movie,Too add to the shaky cam rant....I hate how all fight scenes now thing they have to be a freaking eyeball convulsion instead of just having a properly choreographed fight that doesn’t make me nauseated after it’s done.
16427,best sunglasses for fashion,Ah awesome! I must have found them on my Micromega search!  I'm really partial to the square + circle ones that you can swap out the rubber rim colors on haha
57965,best cologne,"J.Peterman's 1903. I used to have three to four rotating colognes. Then I got the J. Peterman. Girls tell me they like it bcuz it is sweet, but still has a prominent musky undertone. Whatever. As long as it is attracting the opposite sex I am going to keep buying it."
55611,best action and adventure novel series,since you were a serious reader i reccommend silverlock by john myers myers.  serious readers will especially enjoy it!

24762,best anime,It sure is weird lmao
5042,best home improvement store,"In my area HD has a much more modern self check out system. You just grab the gun and scan away, without even removing stuff from your cart.

Lowes on the other hand still has the self checkout system that makes you put everything on their scale/bagging area after you scan it. Try buying a few loose nuts and bolts that practically weigh nothing and dont register anything on their scale, you will be there forever. Item is in the bagging area it just doesnt fuckin weigh anything. Then the cashier comes over hits a few buttons to make the system ignore the scale and it works for the 1 item and then they walk away... but, but I still have 30 more nuts to scan and I have to wait for her to come back 30 more times. This was right after I watched a guy going around their flooring section for 15 minutes shouting ""hello, does anyone work here?"" 

Fuck Lowe's. HD all the way.

Either way whenever I'm doing the self checkout my mind always goes back to Bill Burr's rant about the self checkout at grocery stores."
16128,best sunglasses for fashion,"Second Knockarounds, have had about 10 pairs and love them. Cheap enough to “knock around” but don’t look cheap."
65602,best phone service company,"...dude, Xfinity Mobile is an MVNO that runs on Verizon's network."
29159,best web hosting service,"I would add regarding DreamHost is that I’m a web designer and I can say that it works well for me. It’s pretty expensive, as you said, and I’m not sure it would be of much use to anyone who isn’t a designer. Also, their email service is weak and there’s not a lot of options that come with it. For basic, rudimentary web hosting, however, it’s fine."
