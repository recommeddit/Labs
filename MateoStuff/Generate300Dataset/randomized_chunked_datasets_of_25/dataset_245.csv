9631,"Just letting you know, there is some construction happening near FT at the moment. I have no idea when it'll be done, but it's quite literally right next to the dorms. Most of the time it's not that loud, but it's a bit of an eyesore when you have a beautiful mountain landscape outside your window. 

Besides that, I am a supporter of the FT experience.",best dorm hall at UCSB

28576,"I'm American but I've been living in Germany for a year and have spent a lot of time staying with German families. 

German breakfast is the best. In my experience, a big basket of rolls and bread will be set on the table. Then an assortment of various delicious itemsâ€”cheese, cold cuts, sausage, jam, Nutella, cream cheese, etc.,â€”are on the table as well. You grab a roll or two, butter them up, and put whatever ingredients you want on your various pieces of bread. 

It's great because it gives you a bunch of delicious options, plus it's not hard at all to set up or clean up. You just bring out the ingredients in their containers, and then when you're done you put them back in the fridge. No pots and pans to clean up, just the plates.",best breakfast foods

30620,">World War I - justified. the germans tried to entice mexico to attack the US. Also german unrestricted u-boat attacks.

No they didn't.  WW1 was completely unjustified.  The us complained about uboats, but ignored the much more extensive British blockade of Germany.  Mexico was in the middle of a civil war at the time and completely incapable of attacking the US.  In fact, there was a US force in mexico at the time hunting down Pancho Villa.

As for Korea and Vietnam, defending sovereign nations from invaders attempting to impose a murderous ideology by force of arms is just about the definition of justifiable war.",best Mexican war to study
