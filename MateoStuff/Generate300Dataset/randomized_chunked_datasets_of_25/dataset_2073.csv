5357,best home improvement store,It's great for wire shelving units and accessories. We got the Container Store brand for shelves but the rest from this site.
56573,best desktop monitor,"I use a Rx 580 for 1080p 144hz.  It's fine for most games.  Just lower settings to high for most games or medium for brand new AAA games.

Although pretty much every monitor recommendation assumes max Ultra settings, it's much more reasonable to set graphics to high for higher framerates.  I don't know why the PC gaming crowd is so obsessed with Ultra settings."

57995,best cologne,"I actually took a female friend with me for express purpose of trying scents *on me* for this reason. Subtle is the key.

30616,best Mexican war to study,"Why is legality the same as morality for you?

All genocides are moral and justified as long as they are not explicitly illegal (and perhaps, additionally, the body politic agrees with them)?

31848,best hotel to live in,In the last I’ve stayed at the El Cortez and walking right out the door and to the gates was amazing. Last year there was a bit more of a walk but still very close. Room was decent. Price was worth the convenience ~$500 4 nights.
