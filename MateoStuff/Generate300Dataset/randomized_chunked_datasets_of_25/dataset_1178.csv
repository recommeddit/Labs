[Inhibition of Cell Division in Escherichia Coli by Electrolysis Products from a Platinum Electrode](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v205/n4972/abs/205698a0.html).

This is especially awesome since they started out with an incorrect hypothesis and still found an effect.  Through careful controls they determined the true nature of the novel and serendipitous discovery which became one of the first effective cancer treatments.  Its concise and well written as well.

Another more sobering choice might be:

Winstein, S. Bycycloheptadiene Dibromides. Journal of the American Chemical Society 83, 1516-1517 (1961).

What makes this article interesting is the warning at the end, a reminder that lab safety should be paramount even when working with presumably benign substances.

>There is no a priori reason  to believe that these 
particular  compounds  are more  dangerous  to man 
than  several  related   substances  widely  used  as 
industrial chemicals; however, of  the three labora- 
tory  workers who  have  used  the  dibromides  and 
bromohydrin, two later  developed similar 
pulmonary  disorders  which  contributed  to  their 
subsequent   deaths.   The   third   has   exhibited 
minor skin sensitivity reactions. 
>Although  we  are aware  of  no prior  toxicological 
history  of   these  compounds,  one  cannot  ignore 
the  possibility   of   an  insidious  long-term   effect 
unknown  to  medicine.    Until  further information 
is  obtained  from  toxicological  testing,  we  recom- 
mend  that  the  compounds  be  handled  only  with 
extreme  caution,  and  that  all  persons  concerned 
with their use be informed of  their possible danger- 
ous  propensities. 

>We would  appreciate any toxicological informa- 
tion on the above-mentioned or related compounds.",best research paper archive

It's not like the webcam will be useless if you find that streaming is not for you, plus reselling the *right* camera is easy, whereas nobody wants your secondhand $20 camera.

If I want to start playing the guitar, as an adult, I'm not going to go out and buy a $5000 guitar and amp and pedals, but I'm also not going to start off with the $50 walmart brand I KNOW I'll immediately want to replace.

16904,"I love the awesome zombie 2D games  like **Force Legend: Zombie Invasion** and **The Walking Dead: The Game**. The zombie games are my favourite mobile, and overall games of all time. **Into the Dead 2**, **Dead Island: Survivors**, **Minigore 2: Zombies** in there also.

Let me share some details about the games:

[Force Legend: Zombie Invasion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/force-legend-zombie-invasion/id1475439440)

It's my all time 2D favourite game. It's a zombie shooter game with 6 chapters and each chapter has 6 levels but the last level is boss. One of the chapter can be accessed only if the user has a special chapter. Moreover, Each character has own different weapons and bullets. The game is quite interesting and addicting.

[The Walking Dead: The Game](https://www.pocketgamer.com/games/018078/the-walking-dead-the-game/)

It’s a game that explores some very dark psychological places, revealing that the undead are not the only thing to be afraid of when society crumbles.

[Into the Dead 2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/into-the-dead-2/id1151220243)

You will experience a journey through the zombie apocalypse in a race to save your family. Arm yourself with an arsenal of powerful weapons and do whatever it takes to survive in a world where no one is safe, how far will you go to make it out alive?

[Minigore 2: Zombies](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minigore-2-zombies/id576939960)

In this game, you have to help JOHN GORE fight his way through sunny lakes, graveyards and freezing plains into a stormy forest where the legendary METUSALEM has brought to life murderous chefs, giant lumberjacks, killer penguins, a single moose, three hundred rabbits and the entire undead army of the COSSACK GENERAL.",best iOS game
