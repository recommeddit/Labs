How’d you feel about the m4? Too aggressive of a shape?
"Just came back from the Upper Saranac this past weekend, the Adirondacks are easily my absolute favorite place to visit."
"I wear Alien, and even the kids I work with love it. You just can't put your finger on it. Always an interesting smell."
"Tversky and Kahneman's [Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/vetta/CS764.dir/judgement.pdf).

The work is all about the way people make decisions in life based on an incomplete understanding of probability.  Totally changed my life when I read it the first time."
"My wife and I purchased water softening from LifeSource water but we have heard great things about their filters.

"Kind of related, Amy Winehouse was the mod of an old Yahoo group before she got famous. It was kind of interesting to read."
Not anymore there’s a blanket
Split.
Don’t give me wrong I really like Cydia especially when I use the flame tweak with it it actually makes it look like it isn’t from iOS 8 but that said Cydia is bloated and his legacy code is its eventual undoing. That and because Saurik walked off from the jailbreak scene and is no longer interested in updating Cydia or Substrate anymore. So far Zebra has been a good alternative for me. I have regular crashes using Cydia but Zebra it’s extremely rare.
"I actually painted a corner orange in my old house, I had the TV at 45° and in that corner with a very warm lamp placed behind it. It ended up making a beautiful sunset-like glow that would light up the room and look great!"
Such a beautiful tree. For some reason it always makes me feel peaceful.
Question! We are moving to a similarly gray city and don’t want to paint all of our walls gray either. Any non-gray colors that you see people using a lot in your area?
"Unless your not wrapping your food, you'll be fine. It's frozen and preferably wrapped properly."
"I know, but I am the only one in my family going to college. Barely anyone works, and I get all my undergrad fully covered by tuition. I don't want to waste time on a degree that won't help me financially, but I'm also afraid to do something I know will benefit me if I'm no good at it because if I get bad grades my financial aid is gone and I am done for.. so this is really important to me tbh"
Why is slaughterhouse 5 considered science fiction?
Mint chocolate chip/cookies and cream. Or mint cookies and cream.
Learning anything should be measured in work hours. One year of 40 hrs a week is about the same amount of time as ~~5~~ 10 years at a half hour every day.
"Felt the same way. When Lukaku went to Inter, Chelsea and Everton fans I saw on Twitter wished him good luck while United fans just made fun of his weight (not all, just the ones I saw sadly). Shame people have these agendas and can't move on"
"Try Defunctland! It's a documentary series about former theme park attractions. Really high production values, and some batshit insane true stories. Micheal Eisner never ceases to fascinate."
"and then there's Phillip lol, who I'm pretty sure doesn't know most women *have* faces"
"I mean besides the out of this world production and cooler-every-time lyrics: 

1. This is just how I listen to music but I'll listen to an album, then if the albums good I'll usually have like single songs I'll play in the future. If it's a particularly great album I'll usually have one, what me and my friends call, ""power trio"", just the three songs that are sickest and also work well together. Examples

- 3001 A Laced Odyssey: Bounce, RIPCD, A Spike Lee Joint 

- Piñata: Thuggin' , Shitsville, Real

- Acid Rap: Favorite Song, NaNa, Smoke Again

This just all subjective of course. What's interesting for me is that this album has none of those. I can pick any three songs and it's a power trio. Weakest would probably be Melatonin->Mobius, but even that is better songwriting than half of what I heard this past year. 

2. Jarobi. What this mans been doing? His verse on The Space Program forcibly made me dance, and that's only the first verse of the album. He kills is in every verse and fucking ""rides"" the beat like no other. Def want to hear more of him + Q Tip. 

3. I'm a huge Tribe fan and The Low End Theory is my favorite album ever so all this is fangirling on my part."
Hell for free food and drinks I'd put out to
"Timeless, really"
"Firefox or something based on it. Chromium is not good enough, because Google still gets to choose how it runs, and because blink has a majority on the browser engine market, Google gets the most say in setting the industry standards.

Anyway, I know this is the Windows sunreddit, but if you're worried about Google then you should also look into the things Microsoft have been getting themselves into.

I am a Linux user. I subscribe to this sub for relevant information when I need it. I feel like the people here often don't get enough outside opinions, and since your post doesn't technically have to do with Windows in the first place, I think I also have a say to bring up that Windows may not be the best OS for someone concerned with these matters. You might like to put some consideration into using a more open-sourced OS."
I’ll be honest... I have no idea what that means lol.
