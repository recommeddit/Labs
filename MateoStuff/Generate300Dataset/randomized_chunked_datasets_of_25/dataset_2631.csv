65252,"Thank you for the heads up! Unreal Mobile must have removed the perk. Very strange. They were bought by Red Pocket, and for a while they included the exact same ""Explorer"" and ""Jetsetter"" international data roaming [add-on options](https://www.redpocket.com/global). What's curious to me is that Unreal Mobile still appears to offer free international calling 80+ countries. I wonder why they would remove the international add-ons? Heck, even [Freedompop](https://www.freedompop.com/global) still offers Red Pocket's international roaming add-ons.

Either way, thank you again for bringing this to my attention. I'll get the plans updated ASAP in time for an August update.",best phone service company

13697,"You can always try emailing the author and ask for it if all else fails. The email address is usually under ""author information,"" and I've never seen that info behind a paywall.

Authors also sometimes post all their publications on their personal website. So even if they don't list their email you may still be able to find them by googling their name and institution and look through their webpage(s).

Sometimes I bug my friends in academia for particular articles.

If you've ever written about science for a news website, sometimes you can use that to get press access. But the quality of press access varies dramatically between publishers and this really only works if you're an actual member of the press. (Most journos I know don't know press access is a thing though, weirdly.)
