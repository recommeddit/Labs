35491,"In Poland we have this drink called 'kociołek Panoramixa' ([Getafix's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_characters_in_Asterix#Getafix) kettle). You basically take a big pot or kettle, pour 1l of vodka, 3 light beers, bottle of some sparkling wine, 1l of an energetic drink and a bottle (500ml or so) of one of these condensed raspberry or cherry syrups. Stir it up, some like it heated, most just take it from here drinking shots from the kettle.

31756,"So I've traveled quite a bit, but never 7 days a week permanently.  I did Monday or Sunday through Thursday every week for two years (been working locally for a few months).  I was comforted by coming back home to all of my ""stuff"" - my bigger tv, my desktop computer, the beer in my fridge, and my friends.  

Do you have any personal stuff in your room?

The thing I hate most about hotels is that there is no personalization.  It's just corporate crap - generic artwork, plastic counters.  Eventually, the small things start to get on your nerves - a frayed edge on a towel, a small spot on your carpet, the internet being too slow, getting a room that isn't facing a good direction.  I would get sick of going out, then get sick of room service.  

All that being said, I'm trying to get back on the road again soon.  I can't stand the idea of losing my airline or hotel status :)",best hotel to live in

58787,I suggest joining r/fragsplits. It is a subreddit that splits bottles of really expensive colognes. You get to test nice colognes and the 10ml bottles tend to last a long time if you vary your scents. When a new split pops up look and see if the scent is something you think you might like.,best cologne
