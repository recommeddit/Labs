53342,best usb c charging cable,"What do y'all use for an adapter when you want to move files from a USB C drive to iPhone? I miss my pixel being able to do that when I was on the go especially with drone photography. I bought an adapter but I guess it's power only, no data transmission."

35491,best alcoholic drink,"In Poland we have this drink called 'kociołek Panoramixa' ([Getafix's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_characters_in_Asterix#Getafix) kettle). You basically take a big pot or kettle, pour 1l of vodka, 3 light beers, bottle of some sparkling wine, 1l of an energetic drink and a bottle (500ml or so) of one of these condensed raspberry or cherry syrups. Stir it up, some like it heated, most just take it from here drinking shots from the kettle.

It's surprisingly not that bad when you drink it, but hangover is bloody apocalyptic."
15790,best sunglasses for fashion,"H&M. $12 a pop, huge selection, all 100% UV protection."
31756,best hotel to live in,"So I've traveled quite a bit, but never 7 days a week permanently.  I did Monday or Sunday through Thursday every week for two years (been working locally for a few months).  I was comforted by coming back home to all of my ""stuff"" - my bigger tv, my desktop computer, the beer in my fridge, and my friends.  

Do you have any personal stuff in your room?

The thing I hate most about hotels is that there is no personalization.  It's just corporate crap - generic artwork, plastic counters.  Eventually, the small things start to get on your nerves - a frayed edge on a towel, a small spot on your carpet, the internet being too slow, getting a room that isn't facing a good direction.  I would get sick of going out, then get sick of room service.  

All that being said, I'm trying to get back on the road again soon.  I can't stand the idea of losing my airline or hotel status :)"
62254,Best RPG game on PS4,What do you like about it? I feel like that’s a really broad question but I’m curious. I haven’t played any of the assassins creed games in a while and felt like revisiting
58787,best cologne,I suggest joining r/fragsplits. It is a subreddit that splits bottles of really expensive colognes. You get to test nice colognes and the 10ml bottles tend to last a long time if you vary your scents. When a new split pops up look and see if the scent is something you think you might like.
32976,best energy drink,"Original/Fire Relentless, haven't had one in years though :("
