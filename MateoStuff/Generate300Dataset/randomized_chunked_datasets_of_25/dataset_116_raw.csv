"Did you watch the video? Boja is correcting misinformation in the video, misinformation which happens to make Tesla look better than it is by comparison. By Cunningham's law, it must be corrected here in the comments."
"I love BPAL too. For some reason, most commercial perfumes smell very astringent to me. Lately I'm wearing Sin, Lust, Crowley and Lemon Scented Sticky Bat. Yum."
"According to this story, I would say no."
"Am a poor student, knitting mittens as I type this."
"Cato the younger? A fool that allowed his principles lead to him being manipulated by Cæsar? I suppose I can see the appeal in him, but I can not shake the feeling that he managed to play himself one to many times, just because he wanted to be holier-than-thou among all the senators. 

Cicero was a great politician though, had some flaws. But his influence even today is rather great. Atleast if you practice law."
Really? I feel like that's kind of harsh. Some people don't have the option to physically go to school. Do you at least give them a chance based on other qualifications?

Hilton Playa Del Carmen was a great time!

She doesn’t like when I play it in the car. I couldn’t resist and played a few songs last week and she was like I still can’t believe you listen to this. I feel like this is some long running joke
Anthony Wiener pre-penisgate. Watching him go off on the GOP in the house was incredibly satisfying.
"I ordered the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Style Series Case for everyday office use and the Eonfine Designed for iPhone 11 Pro Case, Shockproof Full-Body Heavy Duty Protection with Built-in Screen Protector for my upcoming trip to Mexico. We'll see how it works out, I've used the Supcase brand before on my iphone 7Plus and iphone X (current)."

"Most of the films listed here are 15+ years old, so I'm trying to add some newer ones.  If animated films count, then Up! should be on the list in my opinion.  Also, Interstellar seems like it should count, unless you'd put it too far into the fantasy category instead."
Spending time with parents is also a good idea.
"It's still easier to space out the cost of college over 22 years than it is over 4 years... Even saving $100 a month from the time they are born you'd have $40,000 with a 6% average return by the time they are ready for college. That is a decent chunk of a CSU leaving you with manageable student loan debt.. if any"
"The names of the authors, and contact details for the corresponding author, are usually with the abstract."
