33331,"You can get an e-bike for less than the cost of insuring any car for one year. I was mostly half joking, because OP is in the US where we have made every form of transportation that's not a personal car or truck or an airplane as difficult and bad as possible. But if it works (paved trails in the right places to avoid roads, etc), an e-bike combined with renting a couple times a year as needed is an amazing value!",best electric car

These 2 girls were talking to me at the bar one student night and they caught a whiff and basically buried their faces in to my neck while I stood there.

I became the amazing smelling guy to these women who would literally screech with glee, run over to me every time they saw me and just sniff my neck and sigh, without fail.  They'd tell other women and they'd smell me and agree and hang around etc.
