6536,best Netflix documentary,"Wild Wild Country was crazy good. Didn't know about it until after I watched it either, still can't believe they managed to build there own city, banks, and all of that. Shocking stuff honestly."
20232,best workout music,"It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie,  Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me."
10519,best suitcase lock,"So that the actual valuable camera isn't tampered with as part of the alternate bag check procedure.

As the comments above you in this chain point out: if you are carrying a firearm (or even a ""starter pistol"" that can not fire a projectile) then you get a special bag check procedure that occurs while you are present."

56898,best water brand,thats so sad :(
42893,best detective show,"The series had a great start with a terrible ending imo. Totally let down. >!Going from a religious/science apocalyptic story to one that is convoluted with dream sequences based in an alter Universe was lame. Nora's alter afterlife story was told in only the last 10 minutes of the last episode - about traversing different worlds with a machine - when 50% of the entire series content was about Kevin, who ended up simply being delusional with a heart issue!< lame."

44441,best items under $100,"It’s not like the roller/sticky paper lint remover. This is specifically for piling of fabrics and if you open it up it has actual little blades in there. I don’t have a recommendation, I just went with the most reviewed online that was under $20 and so far so good. It made a sweater that I love look so much better!"

8789,best toothpaste,"Unfortunately, I am not a dentist, and cannot recommend mouth cleaning products, as I don't use them. My original comment was just repeating what I have been told from dental professionals, though."
69153,best major to study in college,"I'm gonna have to disagree.  There should be some element of ""follow your dreams,"" but you also have to be realistic.  Not everyone should be a STEM major, but you also shouldn't pick majoring in theater, because you'll just end up with a lot of debt and underemployed.  There needs to be some sort of balance.  A job doesn't have to be your dream job and doesn't have to pay six figures straight out of school.  It should be something that you like and can make a living off of."

22405,best celebrity,"met Matthew Lillard, his wife, and newborn daughter like literally after the release of the 1st Scooby Doo Movie. My family always host 4th of July parties in our beach house, and he party crashed. I was like 7 or 8 at the time and my cousins were freaking out saying ""Shaggy is here!"". Of course I immediately sprinted over and he was eating a hot dog (super cliche I know since it's the 4th of July lol). He was so cool. The whole time he was in character and offering me to have him go get a hot dog for me. I remember my little cousins asking where Scooby was at and he replied, ""Oh Scoobs ate sooo many hot dogs that he's like, having a food coma"". Seriously, one of most highlighted memory dating back to my youth"
