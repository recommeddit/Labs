34104,best NFL player,"well lemme break it down for ya sally. 
 You see, the part where it is the ""greatest of all time"" kind of plays into the greatest rappers of all time, in the part where the phrase ""greatest of all time"" is used.   
  I then take this similarity and place it into a situation.... and BOOM upvotes from people who get simple popular reference humor. For not picking up a play on words you sure do have the wrong username."

12568,best gifts for mom,The first time I got a gift from my kids it was because the school pulled their names for this event they just started doing. They would take a few kids from the elementary school and couple them with seniors from the high school. They would go on a field trip to a department store like Wal-Mart with a budget of $100 And help them buy their loved ones gifts for Christmas. My son got me a copy of the movie Pitch Perfect. I cried. It was so sweet that he thought of me and wanted to make me laugh. I still watch that stupid movie often.  I love it because of my son.
55743,best action and adventure novel series,Yeah I like my monsters unfortunately. Thanks for the info though.
40802,best instrument to play,"I play classical/fingetstyle acoustic guitar and honestly my advice would be go with the instrument you most like. I've been playing guitar for a long time but a part of me wishes I had taken up the piano/keyboard instead, though I'm quite happy with choosing the guitar. Piano is an excellent instrument for a beginner, to the point that a lot of instructors will teach you some very basic piano regardless of the instrument you play. (It is easy to teach music fundamentals on the piano) Many consider piano to be a 'complete' instrument (you can play bass, chords and melody at the same time, not all instruments give you that liberty). All instruments are expressive and beautiful in their own way but a piano has an edge in some way over others. 

End of the day, choose what you imagine you would most enjoy. Ukelele and electric guitars are amazing instruments too"

2914,best headphones,"Hi.. I'm planning to get the 599 SE as well but I have been hearing mixed reviews saying they are muddy, veiled, takes time to get used to etc. What were first impressions when you got them? Are these your first open back headphones?"

14771,best romantic novel,"I recently discovered Kerrigan Byrne and I’m so impressed with her beautiful language. I just finished The Duke With the Dragon Tattoo (disregard dumb title) and she wrote a dark villainous angsty piney antihero soooooo well. Think Heathcliff but not toxic. I’d also recommend anything by Madeline Miller. She writes some of the most gorgeous prose, period, independent of genre."
73820,best matte screen protector for ipad,">r. Put it on when you’re doing notes and take it off when you want to enjoy the mini led screen. So it’s a win win situation

which one do you use?"
63434,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Yes sadly it doesn’t work. Thanks I’ll remove it from list  .
3734,best college for research,"It's not showing the border of Michigan, but the border between the US and Canada, which cuts through the middle of most of the Great Lakes."
6881,best iPhone,"The 6s has new features like:

-	Stronger aluminum chasis
-	4k video capture 
-	3D Touch
-	2nd gen. TouchID
-	Stronger glass
-	4 microphones

The 4k video and 3D touch alone is what makes the 6s upgrades the best one yet in terms of hardware.

Nowadays the upgrade from iPhone to iPhone involves mainly just the camera and battery improvements."

30058,best money managing app,"In the app, category and labels are separate. A record can only have one category. It can have many labels though"
31105,best country to live in,"Medicine is an interesting choice; there are some countries with similar qualification and training, but moving abroad means getting tested/certified by the local governing body - lots of paper-work, and in the worst case you have to restart your training from scratch.

(My wife is a doctor, she moved from Finland to Scotland, and there was a fair bit of paperwork involved getting registered & permission to work in A&E from the GMC.)"
40796,best instrument to play,"With electric guitar or digital piano, I could play without disturbing room mates; also, to me at least, less variety of songs seem to translate well to acoustic in the sense of retaining their emotion.  A lot of pieces seem to become more campy or aggressive pieces sound like a seductive Spanish serenade."
60736,Best comedy show on Netflix,Nanette was incredible but it's the only time I watched a stand up comedy special and legit bawled.
32781,best free online grammar checker,"Ah does it? The premium version enforces a compound style guide?

The tips about dictionaries and reading up and whatnot are great for new writers, but this is a different situation for me. I've been writing seriously for almost 20 years, 15 of those professional. It's not an issue of knowledge, *I* know that home buying is still the most formally correct form, homebuying is often used as one of those technically-incorrect-but-growing forms, and home-buying should never be used. But that doesn't matter. My brain wanted to do all three forms in one paragraph, so it did. It's like a game, seeing what words it can chop up or compound for me hiding in plain sight as I write. So I really do need a *tool* that is going to actively enforce things or at least grab my attention better.

It's rough with compounds because a lot of them are legitimately a matter of style or represented in multiple ""correct"" forms across dictionaries, so I just need something that's going to mechanically enforce *a* standard, any standard. Something to crack my neural blind spot."
