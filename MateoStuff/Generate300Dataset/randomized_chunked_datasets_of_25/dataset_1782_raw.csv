"Just in the past two years, I started listening to The Skeptics Guide to the Universe.  It's not specifically a biology podcast- it hits all science topics but if you want to become a PA, they talk a LOT about fraudulent alternative medicine practices.  I'm an optometrist and have learned a great deal.  Not too much of it specifically applies to my field but when someone brings up a pseudoscientific treatment, I'm much more confident and successful at talking them out of it."

You are way over stating the importance of slavery in the Texas Revolution it may have been a sticking point but it wasn't the driving factor.
">I had to accept myself as an adult before I could begin my adult relationship with her.

This is exactly it. Kids are kids, and they need time to blossom into adults. Until then you're an adult talking to a kid, and kids hate that - even if and especially if you are their parent. Some mature faster than others but someday they will understand what a Mother does."
"I have to be honest, that sounds kind of nasty, and a bit high maintenance.  I'm not sure if I'd actually be able to tell the difference between food cooked in a seasoned cast iron skillet and food cooked in a brand new steel skillet, or between food cooked in a cast iron skillet with three generations of seasoning and food cooked in a cast iron skillet that's been seasoned recently with oil.  I have a small cast iron skillet (seasoned according to the manufacturer's directions) that I use rarely because it's so damned heavy and because it tends to heat unevenly, resulting in scorch marks that are difficult to remove."

"No, that's a terrible tip. Please realize most paint mfgrs have an entire white book."
Sent them an email telling them their interface is clunky and unusable. Hopefully they do something about it.
Samsies! See this is so worth seeing in every thread because I didn’t read it until now and I should have read it so long ago!
"He had HoF QBs throwing him the ball on 64% of his passes. For comparison, Randy Moss only had 19% of his passes from HoF QBs. A massive difference."
"The people who work in the computer lab under the library wear purple vests so you can see who they are, ask them questions, have them fix a printer etc. 

If you're leaving soon, I wouldn't mind you making me a mod, seeing as I am actively involved at school and will still be there for two more years!"

"Drew Gooden, dudes got hours of hilarious content."
Met him at the papa johns HQ. A worker there said that apparently every time he comes he’ll bring a bunch of little caesars or Pizza Hut pizza just to get a laugh out of everyone... great guy
Do you use an iPad? My searching has only yielded screensharing in the other direction (from desktop to iPad). How do you share your iPad screen to your desktop mac?
"Wow, really? I see it on a few of these lists, but have no idea what it is. This makes it seem interesting and scary as hell at the same time."
"Lots of good ones mentioned, but I don’t see David Fincher’s The Game here yet:
