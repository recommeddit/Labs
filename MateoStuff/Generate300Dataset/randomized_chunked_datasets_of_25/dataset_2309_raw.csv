"I was at a knicks game and Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Lorne Michaels and Jeff Daniels were there. I was 11 or so and I walked up and asked for an autograph and they said no. Then my 23 year old smoking hot sister in law walked up and asked them for an autograph and they obliged. She then told them that they were assholes and they should be ashamed of themselves and she gave me the autograph in front of them. 

It was the week of Jan 8 1995, Jeff Daniels hosted SNL that Saturday 

Edit: it was Tuesday Jan 10 and the Knicks beat the Pacers"
The fact that Dak got in over him is just straight bananas.

"Would also like to hear opinions on this one...I've been debating for a long time. Loved Witcher, liked FFXV, and couldn't get into Persona (anime stuff is not my jam). Did enjoy DQXI but tired of the music and stereotypical characters."
I listen to podcasts during cardio only. Need something more upbeat for weights

The Battered Bastards of Baseball. Really good documentary featuring Kurt Russell talking about the last unaffiliated minor league baseball team. Its a solid watch for sports fans and non-fans alike.
"> I have an extract of brandy butter I think

I just half a jar of it in my normal custard base :) 

> Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible 

I find durian to be not quite so bad as it's reputation, especially because there are different 'types' of durian, which smell to varying degrees. In ice cream the smell was pretty neutral. But the texture had transferred over too, and that was what really got me. I've had awful luck adapting to the texture of a number of southeast asian desserts (ais kacang ... *shudders*)."
I don't draw very much and was hoping to get some more information out of this thread but I have always used Staedtler and Prismacolor pencils whenever I do draw.
"Oh, that's fabulous to hear; I'm glad that exists. They seem like a cool company."
Yea I saw those on the website with coming soon. I have to submit my order to the exec assistant by march 1st though so not sure if they're going to come out in time... but they looked pretty nice.
"I actually tried that series.  It would have succumbed to my 40 page rule, but I really wanted to like it.  Still gave up after 100 pages.  Maybe I'll try again one day."
"I think you're simplifying our homeless situation here in California, but yes we don't match up with your list. Not sure any place really does. 

Oh the mythical 40 hour week!"
One of the movies I was thinking of myself! One of my favorite movies when I was little
Think this thread should be who is the greatest player in your franchises history. Walter Jones.
"Best thing about Nike is the returns process. You can safely buy a pair, try them outside and return them if they are not for you.

One of React Infinity, Pegasus, and the new ZoomX Infinity would be my choice for a standard shoe from Nike."

"Finland, or really all of the Nordics tick all those criteria except maybe weather."
Hate to ask this here but it seems like some of you might know. Where could I get a good R.O. machine? I am concerned about the quality of the water in my home and was wondering if anyone could tell me of a reliable manufacturer of these. How much does a good R.O. machine cost? Do you need to add minerals back to the water before drinking it?
