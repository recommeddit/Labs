"Whether or not this gets down voted, I'm going to say it anyway. Anything by O'Reilly."
The Danish show ‘Forbrydelsen’ has some of the same vibes. ‘The Killing’ was built from it.
"I love that Irish fecker and his weird vampire, wizard mass-kidnapping Sim."
"Nice couple of people to have met, particularly Buzz Aldrin. Always going to be a special person in history so you're a lucky person!"
"It is completely up to you. Go to a shop, try out different keyboards, see which you like. I prefer blues for their nice click."

my guess is organ and viola

"The Times, the Guardian (though it has a left wing bias that some people take issue with) and the Independent are the more literate papers. Possibly also the Telegraph - though that has a right wing bias that some people take issue with.

The thing to bear in mind is that in the UK newpapers are not politically neutral, they have a clear and stated bias.  For neutrality in news reporting people would go to the BBC.

The Daily Mail is known for being hateful and  mendacious."
"Yeah, being a single mother totally fits in with all those other things."
It's certainly not for everyone.   I love it and plan on reading it again.   Joyce's Ulysses is my nemesis.   I've started it at least 5 times and i just can't even.   Only reason it is still on my shelf is that it is the last Christmas gift I got from my mom and it has a nice note from her inside the cover.
This is awesome. I made a res at the lark. Seeing it pop up a ton. Think im planning on doing Arigato but know there is no res. Any local favorites / off the beaten path I need to try?
I am on an SSRI and did not know that dextramorphan is contra-indicated. Avoid it if you don’t want it to mess with your meds- not a fun downer.
You watched the whole thing?? Im FREEEE!
"Depends what you use it for. Modern games can't push 144 fps at 4k.

If you play some strategy, moba, or things like that, then sure.

Or if you don't game and need it for something esle, sure.

I got a second monitor, 4k 60hz becasue I cheaped out.

It's a productivity monitor for work, I'll be coding on it."
Nice you still in bioinformatics? What kind of stuff do you work on?
L'air du Temps by Nina Ricci
What about it does not fit the definition?
"Yeah can understand that for sure. For my use, the X still lasts me all day (and more, most days), unless I'm working out of pocket which is usually several times a year to be honest - and always near power."
"Cc: /u/MikeNotBrick: awesome guide! I would love to see a (sub-)section of the Multi Monitor part that discusses the compatibility/impact of mix and matching refresh rates for multi screen setups. 

I’m currently looking at going from 27”/1440p@60hz dual monitors to 144hz. It’s really hard to find any good info on whether I can upgrade just my main monitor to the asus 27”/144/1440p and use my existing asus 27”/60/1440p for my second screen or if I should upgrade both. 

I keep hearing people mention that alt-tabbing is an issue with different refresh rates and that playing a twitch stream on the 2nd screen while gaming at a higher refresh rate on the 144hz GSYNC screen would cause video to stutter etc. 

Budget isn’t the issue but obviously I don’t want to buy 2 new screens if just upgrading the main one will suffice. 

Also, do gaming modes factor in at all? I usually play “windowed borderless” instead of “full screen” for example as I interact with the second screen a lot. 

Cheers!"
Is there a weekly view?
"Glad to hear it worked out for you in the end. I've never heard of either of those movies, but yay cuz now I have something to watch. It's been a while since I've seen a good rom-com."
How much do you tip a chambermaid? Do you prefer to have your bedsheets tucked or untucked?
