"Let your lady friends know we have the answer to pocket-lovin' ladies' desires at scottevest.com! As for pricing, for the value you're getting, it's a really great  buy. Our gear lasts a LONG time. Some guy just Tweeted us a pic of his FOURTEEN (yes, 14) year old original SCOTTEVEST jacket. Still looked great! We also have daily sales of varying items. PS We are developing a SCOTTEVEST dress right now with hidden pockets all over!"
Also the monetization is atrocious.

"Refusal of universal healthcare and common sense gun laws because they're ""communist""/""unpatriotic"", rampant patriotism in general, religious nutjobs and conservative hardliners with great influence in the country's politics, college education that will get you in debt so deep you'll have to work decades to pay it off, blowing 700 billion dollars a year on an overblown military, and of course your stable genius president.

"I've had this [pair] (http://www.atozeyewear.com/PERSOL-Po2931s_p_11277.html?gclid=CJC9qM2Jj8sCFQFkhgodYLAMRw) of Persols in the Tobacco - Polar Brown color combo for almost two years now and I love them.
