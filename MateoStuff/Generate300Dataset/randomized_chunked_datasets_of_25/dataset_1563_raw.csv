"FUN FACT: If you got to the old dead r/reddit.com, I have the 4th highest post and it's a link regarding that video. It's stuck there a part of Reddit history."
That last scene of dont f with cats tho
"I'm not sure that Australian batting line up can play well in India! Barring Hayden, others sound struggle I think. Even Hayden also had only that one dream tour in 2001 while he didn't perform extraordinarily on other tours to India.
And yeah, Smith to some extent."
"Years ago I stumbled upon a pack of ""100 greatest sci-fi novels"" audiobooks. While I don't think the ranking itself means much, nevertheless they are some fantastic books that have profoundly changed my worldview. One of the best decisions I've ever made. Here are some of my favorites in no particular order:

1. Hyperion - Dan Simmons 
This book is way underrated. Told in frame structure about a group of pilgrims travelling to a mysterious planet called Hyperion to meet a creature called the Shrike, the story of each pilgrim is unique and beautiful and impacts me to this day. Cannot recommend enough.
2. I, robot - Isaac Asimov
A history of robotics told through charming short stories. Many really challenge your morals and values as it asks very critical questions - for instance, should a robot hold political power, if they are programmed to do the best for humanity? Amazing, thought provoking book. Nothing like the movie.
3. The Martian Chronicles-Ray Bradbury
This one I also don't see talked about too much, but it's one of my favorites. Again, a series of short stories detailing humanity's discovery of mars and martians. Very unique thoughts behind this one - for instance, what if we finally meet martians, but they don't believe we are aliens? Fascinating read.
4. Rendezvous with Rama - Arthur C Clarke
Classic Clarke hard fiction, a crew investigates a mysterious object flying towards earth. Good old adventure, unraveling the world bit by bit. Definitely takes you to another world and is hard to put down.
5. Enders Game
This was the first book in the pack and started me off on this whole sci fi adventure. This is fairly well known so I won't talk about it too much, but God its an amazing story with amazing characters. The sequal, Speaker for the dead, is very different but amazing as well. Both would recommend."
Have you read anything else by her? I've been looking at An Unseen Attraction but I'm unsure and audible credits cost £8.
I see nothing wrong with 17 rides on Mako :)
Eluveitie and Korpiklaani for the win!

I like to make things."
"> Actually, it's the other way round - bash uses emacs keys by default.

Yes, of course I understand this, but i was communicating with someone (the OP) likely more used to bash than emacs, as emacs wasn't even on the list of editors."
Love the first half.
UUUU buy and retire
The Usual Suspects
The old timer candies are actually good but I will always associate them with old people still
"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


No for real, spoilers below.


I loved that scene because around that point in the movie, I began to think ""oh great, that's the big twist, we'll find out he's a robot, too.""  I thought I had figured it out and was gonna be bored with the rest of the movie with that cliche ending.  Then the dude slices his fucking arm open to prove me wrong.  It was awesome as fuck and I was hooked.  Fantastic movie."
My hero!! This guy is the guy of the night! (or girl)
Should they all set up Patreons then?
"The Atlantic is my best bet, but High Country News is one of the best magazines in the country. It's all western news, but amazing journalism and a great community."
I'm surprised that no one voted for Porto in the Other category. They have more European trophies than Benfica and are only about 5-6 trophies behind them domestically (unless you only count the major ones like the league and cup).
I have already listened to madvilliany but I'll try the others thanks
"I'm British and do this, but everyone thinks I'm super weird! The most common comment is 'well it wouldn't work for me, I like to snuggle sometimes when it's cold' it's a blanket, not the fucking Berlin wall, you can snuggle whenever you want ffs. 2 duvet master race for life."
"He ran the country into a civil war, that wasn't necessary."
"> (other than the president running the country but I won't start a debate on that)  

And yet you couldn't stop yourself from sliding it in there."
"I always like to open the door with a 1/2 gallon of ice cream, take a big scoop and say ""Ok, who's first"" just to see the WTF looks on their faces."
"I loved The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  I don’t understand why it didn’t do better at the box office. It was clever, smart and fun."
"> Bloodborne

this is the first time i'm seeing somebody call Bloodbourne an RPG"
