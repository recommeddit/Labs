"Yeah, Infinity War not being higher is the one that surprises me the most."
"I really think guitar and piano both have it's ups and downs.
Guitar is easier To transpose, but piano have more and easier acessible voicings.
Piano have a wider range and guitar is more portable.
Guitar have more ""sibilings"" (bass, electric/acoustic, uke, mandolin, banjo, etc.) that you can re-use and exchange technique. Piano have keyboards/synths that open a wide variety of possibilities soundwise.
I think both are viable as far as theory goes but you have to analize your needs/possibilities.

I'm a guitar player myself, but I really admire  piano as the great instrument it is and I'm trying to get around finding my way in these keyboards"
"Harry S Truman, the guy who everyone declared dead in the water in 1948 who not only proved the pundits wrong by winning, but led his party to recapturing both houses of congress by branding congress the 'Do Nothing' congress."
Stitches! Best one yet!

">Good for basic editing, but it is limited in what all it can do.

Nano should not be underestimated. The editor offers much more than just the functions displayed in the lower bar.

"I've found Blenders eyewear (https://www.blenderseyewear.com/) to be pretty good quality and great price! I have their snow goggles too and I love them. 

Here's a $20 off link (http://fbuy.me/lkr0-) for frugality!"
This was one of the first videos I ever saw on the internet.
Tried searching the name for nothing . What this tweak is used for ?

If you don’t need the matte protector you can go with a tempered glass one (I really like them and they preserve screen clarity!)

My boyfriend really likes Armani Code.
"Don’t go for the small animals (seem easy to care for but cage cleaning+having to be carful with handling = board children and more work along with shorter life spans). cats are good especially if you get a lazy, nice, shelter cat who likes kids (I had one and he was the best pet ever). If you do go the dog route bulldogs are amazing, I had 2 when I was younger and they were probably the most patient, loving dogs ever. They are also really easy to care for since they don’t shed as much as some other breeds I’ve had."

5. I'm saving this spot for that elusive m/f book I have yet to give five stars to. I will find one eventually. Maybe if I stopped reading so much m/m... 

Although, if I had to pick my fave m/f I would say Beach Read or Stay by Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy"
Great Italian place on Milpas!
I have some Numark red wave DJ headphones. I got them on sale for $45 and they are easily the best headphones I've ever used.
"> I've even hung out with them on occasion (which is against the rules).

Why exactly is it against the rules?"
"Burberry Brit is one of those that I used to always have on hand. I haven't bought a bottle in a year or two, but I might have to go pick one up in the next cpl days. It is a very nice scent. I'm a pretty big fan of Grey Flannel too. I picked it up one day just for the hell of it. I figured for $10, if I didn't like it, I could give it away or find some use for it. But I was pretty happy with it"
If it makes you happy it makes you happy!
"Mine is dave chappelle too. I was in a college group that brought in speakers and performers so we brought him in. After his act we thought he left, so we started eating all the trays of food in his waiting room. He poked his head in and joked that we were hotboxing the room. Then he came and sat with us for an hour! He sat next to me, and when I told him it was my friends birthday and this friend was a big fan, he took my phone and called this friend and talked to him. It was amazing. This was 2005, I think right before he took a big break from everything."
"Used to be a Sublime Text 3 nut, just because I like something simple. 

And then I discovered VS Code. Does the same thing, its light weight, but lets me jump around when I look at a function/class definition or whatever. Has extensions to let me do my job faster, and looks cool."
