25425,best cricket teams of all time,"WestIndies : Greenidge, Haynes, Richards, Lara, Sobers, Walcott and Weeks

Australia : Hayden, Warner, Bradman, Ponting, Border, Waugh and Gilchrist 

India : Gavaskar, Sehwag, Dravid, Sachin, Kohli 

England : Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond Barrington, May, Compton, Botham

Australia has Don Bradman but the WestIndies and England teams looks more legendary IMO."
9193,best toothpaste,"I'm in dental hygiene school... And I use kids Colgate because adult toothpaste is too spicy for me. Plus, it's got transformers on it and transformers make everything more exciting. I also have a children's darth vader electric toothbrush.... As for flossing, I hated doing it but then I started keeping floss in my car. I floss stopped in traffic, red lights. Now I floss every day."

54462,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"So far otsu v2 durability has been fantastic! Same as zero and hien. Raiden is also in that category.

I'd say if you like control and don't want to get too wild with your first artisan, the zero is perfect! Very safe artisan to start with!"
25653,best cricket teams of all time,"They also had Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee at the same time. All of them are among the top wicket takers of all time. 

As good as the batsmen were, McGrath and Warne were better. I was too young to really appreciate it 100% at the time, but that team was insane all round. On top of that Andrew Symonds damn near revolutionised fielding as well - what a lot of people forget is that Australia was an era ahead of the rest in the field for the early stages of that team."
68424,best science fiction novel,"Nice, I haven't met a lot of people who have read it. Really loved it.

abb is over a decade old I believe. there are a few really active members but 99% of their traffic is just non-interacting consumers. I agree the search is in need of a revamp

someone else suggested myAnonamouse, I haven't tried it yet since it's invite only, just waiting until I can make time for the interviews they hold

other than that, abb is the only free, public aggregator specifically for audiobooks"
9693,best dorm hall at UCSB,Most of the Mountain/Ocean clusters do have common areas. From what I've seen it's the suites with singles that do not have it.
68209,best science fiction novel,I'd never heard of Worm before. Nearly 2 million words! Did you read it all at once or over time?

I am interested more in durability, but im just getting drawn by the cosmetics for the flex. What would you guys suggest?

I'll be mainly using this for daily browsing and coding a lot."
