6874,best iPhone,"I love it! If I fully charge the phone, I easily make it through the day without needing to recharge, and I'm using it constantly. On days where I'm using it a little below average, I even make it through the night without recharging. I've had the phone 8 months now, and no change in battery life whatsoever!

Also love the fact that if I plug it into a fast-charging adapter, I only need about 15-20 min to get it up past 60%. This is easily the best battery I've ever had in a smartphone.

The one activity that drains it fast is recording 4k video at 60fps. I can get about 2.5 - 3 hrs of record time before dropping below 15%. That's still impressive to me, considering the screen is on that entire time and it's processor is working hard. If I'm just watching video with bluetooth headphones (like on a trip), the battery lasts forever. After a few hours of binge watching a Netflix show the other day, I noticed the battery barely drained. Think I started with about 90% and still had like 65%. That's just amazing to me."

41743,movies like Inception,"Glad you liked it, I remembered Richard O'Brien from The Crystal Maze so it was quite a surprise to see him acting in a serious film. 
It's a shame they have the voice over at the start at all, known a few people that have seen the normal version with it in and as a result lost interest in the film because they could guess how it was all going to play out. 
Now I've been talking about it, I may just watch it again... Help pass this night shift I'm on."
3377,best webcamera,"I agree , I kind of pushed off streaming for a couple of years due to personal issues. And the last year and a half I was like okay I need to do this and kind of was in the impression that I needed everything top class and was a bit intimidated. But decided let's just roll the dice and got the logitech c920 when it went on sale over the summer for like $35, doing it on a decent laptop (not a gaming or top end) and was running my mic for stream off the webcam. It was pretty decent once you tweak it and set some filters on it. My biggest purchase was the el gato. And recently just saved up to get a hyperx quadcast mic to try it out since it was $40 off over the weekend."

47164,best state to visit in the United States,"If you go South, youre going to have a hell of a time. just saying...Id recommend doing a loop starting in Atlanta (since youll probably fly in here if not NYC), Athens, Chattanooga, Nashville, Knoxville, Asheville (Ill buy you a beer if you stop by here), Charleston, Savannah, and back up to Atlanta.     pro tip: The North Shore in Minnesota and the Boundary waters canoe area...this is beautiful and underexplored.   

edit: The best thing about the US is its diverse landscape...Id suggest planning your trip around that and having the culture be a secondary concern"

69894,best major to study in college,"Code. Code as much as humanly possible. A lot of CS programs are rigorous in their theoretical/math courses, and that's important because it's a science.. But many don't turn you into an effective developer. Code as much as you can outside of courses- when it comes time to get a job, very few companies will ask you about the calculus and discrete math you learned, but they will give you a problem and tell you to solve it in whatever language they use, and ask about the frameworks and DBs you're familiar with (which do not tend to get adequate coverage in school by default)

Edit: the best comparison I can make is music. If you go to music school, you already love music and play an instrument/create it. That's how you get paid gigs. Schooling is there to enable your understanding of what's happening when you play.. But at no point do you stop practicing. If you don't love coding outside of school, it's going to be difficult to be successful"
