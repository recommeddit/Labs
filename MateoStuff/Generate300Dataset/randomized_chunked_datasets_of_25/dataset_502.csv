Edit: I’ll note that color banding is not entirely eliminated in the A08 and A09 revisions, it’s barely ever noticeable and I’ve certainly not noticed it myself.

If you’re like me, or everyone I know, sunglasses last me a matter of weeks.  They’re easily lost, somehow get scratched in my backpack, or I simply come across a pair that makes me throw my current shades into that ‘everything’ drawer. Something so transient should not eat your dollars.

Sunglasses, especially, have an extremely high markup when stamped with a brand name.

Any pair retailed over $99 is highway robbery.

I like zeroUV.com for $10 sunnies that are high-quality and stylish.",best sunglasses for fashion

The venue was pretty intimate and only had a few chairs surrounding the stage with everyone else standing. We got there early enough to be one of the first row standing.

Right after the opening act he came out and immediately noticed us and asked if we were all Filipinos.  Well, he definitely guessed right! He started talking about how we are his family and went right into the details about his family. the food, culture and his own family. Like having a humorous conversation during his set. Pretty surreal.

Anyways after a killer show, everyone was filtering out when one of the producers stopped us and asked if we can be in some of the B roll footage along with Katt Williams since he was also there checking out the show. Of course, we agreed and sat next to him.

As soon as it was over,  Dave was on stage smoking a joint and I told him it was my birthday that night. He asked what my name is, I said, amour-y-moi! He then grabbed the microphone and with everyone else still around he said, ""Today's Amour-y-moi's birthday and I'm buying shots for everyone!!"". Got to do a shot with him. One of the best random birthday moments ever!",best celebrity
23127,"Met Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) from Stranger Things while we took a senior trip to Universal Studios!

He was in Orlando for Comicon (i think, i know he was speaking on a panel with Caleb) and he stopped by and said he had to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. As soon as he walked by, my mom, dad, and older brother immediately recognized him. We talked with him about the show and how he was finishing scenes up the week after! He was an incredible little kid, and that made the whole trip.

Sadly, we didn’t get a picture, since the bodyguard told us he didn’t want to attract attention because he was with his family. We respected that, and honestly I’m glad we chatted for ~10 minutes rather than take a pic and go. 

My first and only celeb experience!! It was wicked.",best celebrity
