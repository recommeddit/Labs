60409,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Recently started watching Episodes and like it, never saw Friends, but Matt Leblanc plays himself and is funny."
26011,best politician,"> Most of em are good.

On a scale of Willie Nelson to Snoop Dogg, how high are you right now?"
17517,best iOS game,Genshin is similar to BotW on the surface level. It's very deep on fighting and character interaction (kits wise) aspects.
61187,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Definitely Trailer Park Boys, that matches your liking completely."
2820,best headphones,"I'm EQ'ing them from Microsoft Sound Control Panel. I also have MH751, I tried to make 670 sound like 751 but couldn't do it. They're definitely step down from 751."
49455,best gaming monitor,"Completely disagree. I have virtually no color banding on mine. The last two revisions don’t have an issue with it, and it’s definitely above average.

Edit: I’ll note that color banding is not entirely eliminated in the A08 and A09 revisions, it’s barely ever noticeable and I’ve certainly not noticed it myself.

I’m not saying it’s the best monitor out there, but for value for money on 1440p/144Hz it’s hard to beat."
58231,best cologne,"Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille

YSL L'homme

41849,movies like Inception,"Time Crimes (aka Los Chronocrimines)

Ignore the slightly crappy title and enjoy a brain-bending time travel movie that doesn't rely on special effects or fancy locations."
15954,best sunglasses for fashion,"NO! Don't waste your money on expensive name brand sunglasses!

If you’re like me, or everyone I know, sunglasses last me a matter of weeks.  They’re easily lost, somehow get scratched in my backpack, or I simply come across a pair that makes me throw my current shades into that ‘everything’ drawer. Something so transient should not eat your dollars.

Sunglasses, especially, have an extremely high markup when stamped with a brand name.

Any pair retailed over $99 is highway robbery.

I like zeroUV.com for $10 sunnies that are high-quality and stylish."

22330,best celebrity,"Dude! To cement that Dave is a cool ass mf, my friends and I were at his Chicago show when he was supposed to film a special for (HBO?) and it was on my actual birthday. The venue was pretty intimate and only had a few chairs surrounding the stage with everyone else standing. We got there early enough to be one of the first row standing.

Right after the opening act he came out and immediately noticed us and asked if we were all Filipinos.  Well, he definitely guessed right! He started talking about how we are his family and went right into the details about his family. the food, culture and his own family. Like having a humorous conversation during his set. Pretty surreal.

Anyways after a killer show, everyone was filtering out when one of the producers stopped us and asked if we can be in some of the B roll footage along with Katt Williams since he was also there checking out the show. Of course, we agreed and sat next to him.

As soon as it was over,  Dave was on stage smoking a joint and I told him it was my birthday that night. He asked what my name is, I said, amour-y-moi! He then grabbed the microphone and with everyone else still around he said, ""Today's Amour-y-moi's birthday and I'm buying shots for everyone!!"". Got to do a shot with him. One of the best random birthday moments ever!"
23127,best celebrity,"Met Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) from Stranger Things while we took a senior trip to Universal Studios!

He was in Orlando for Comicon (i think, i know he was speaking on a panel with Caleb) and he stopped by and said he had to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. As soon as he walked by, my mom, dad, and older brother immediately recognized him. We talked with him about the show and how he was finishing scenes up the week after! He was an incredible little kid, and that made the whole trip.

Sadly, we didn’t get a picture, since the bodyguard told us he didn’t want to attract attention because he was with his family. We respected that, and honestly I’m glad we chatted for ~10 minutes rather than take a pic and go. 

My first and only celeb experience!! It was wicked."
42199,movies like Inception,"Richard Linklater did Waking Life with the rotoscoping before A Scanner Darkly.

Sort of mindfuck-y. It's like a layman's 'intro' to a slew of philosophical topics."
2795,best headphones,"Would you recommend aptx HD over the aptx low latency? And does Bluetooth aptx in general sound better than any wireless gaming headset 2.4ghz wireless out there?

I’m thinking of getting a good wireless headphone that could go together with the Modmic Wireless based on your recommendation."

14592,best romantic novel,"I’m always trying to push a few authors...Lauren Layne, Julie James, & Meghan Quinn! oh and my new favorite Joanna Shupe"
5339,best home improvement store,"So, my favorite by far is [Funky Sofa](http://www.funkysofa.com). Some of the sofas are a bit pricey, But they have the coolest looking sofas/couches and they are all custom. They have tons of fabrics and color choices at the base price and the premium fabrics are usually not very much more."
