"I was working on a set once where John C. Reilly acted as one of the main characters. It was a pretty small set and low budget (not even sure if the show ever aired) so we all found ourselves working closely together for the most part.

I sat across from him during lunch one day and we chatted for a bit about random stuff. The guy talks the same way he acts, which is why I think he plays such a great character in any comedy because he quite literally plays his own attitude in many roles.. at least it seems. 

But anyway he was a very nice and down to earth guy, I found it hard not to giggle every time he spoke because I just couldn't shake the image in my head of all the roles he's played."
"Nah I always have a 20,000 mAh one and a 3,350 mAh one. The larger one is great for long travel and if you are on the top bunk of your hostel and there are no outlets. I use it as an outlet for the 2-3 days I'm there an dont worry about charging my phone from the wall during the day. The smaller one I carry with me when I go out at night or if I am not going to have a bag with me. I think a large one and a small one are a perfect duo!

Edit: I can see just getting a 10,000 mAh one though. I just really like having a larger one and a smaller one."
Go google or go home!
That's normal. Sounds like you two have a healthy thing going on.
Yeah that site is great.
"Good question! Shidenkai is definitely faster and smoother, but if you're looking for a lot of speed and durability the Raiden is perfect.

I don't use hard pads so can't compare."

"It's not that credible intervals are easier than confidence intervals, but that the people you're speaking too have heard of one and not of the other. 

You never need to explain results to someone without any statistics knowledge, when the reality is that they're already very versed in one and don't want to put in the work to learn something new. Cultural change is infinitely harder.

Then the reality of Bayesian analysis is very different. It works well when the models are there, but stuff like trees and boosting don't fit, and Bayesian neural nets don't have an advantage over normal ones with dropout."
Better to learn a Python Web development framework than pick up PHP if you already know Python IMO.
"Manzi is the best dorm and if ure lucky you can get a ocean view. It’s also right next to IV so if u come back from a party you don’t need to walk far af to get home! 

FT is 1 mile from campus and is def a raging dorm building."
"I actually enjoyed the first 3 and thought it could've stood alone as a cool trilogy with a few tweaks, but after the third the series took a HUGE nosedive."

"My boyfriend and I just moved into a duplex and wanted to paint the walls grey (they were a horrible high-gloss renters'-beigey-tan). We wanted that perfect grey—not too warm, not too cool, not too light or too dark. Trying to achieve that via swatches and paint samples was. a. nightmare. Greys look impossibly different on any given wall, in any given light, and with any given object/other colored surface nearby. I know that's true to an extent with any paint color, but I swear, grey is particularly challenging. It really picks up its surroundings.

We ended up getting so frustrated, we just took a drawer from the (white) kitchen cabinets to Sherwin Williams to get it matched. We had reached our ""fuck it, whatever"" point. They missed the drawer color in a slightly grey direction, but I took home a sample anyway and painted big patches of various walls. Lo and behold, it was the grey we'd been after the whole time. It still looks really different in different areas/light, but it plays nicely with everything else in the space, which none of the other (six, plus waaay more swatches) greys we tried could do.

tl;dr, picking paint colors is a pain in the ass"
"Indian Head is one of my favorite hikes that I've done so far. Here's one of my shots from there!

Not sure but I had the same case for my XS Max and it survived several drops.
"The Infographics Show is really terrible. Their ""facts"" are usually wrong. They have decent artwork, but make sure you double check EVERYTHING you see on there, because they are wrong a lot of the time. They've had to pull videos before because people who actually knew something about it called them out. Check out the video of the actual fighter jet pilot critiquing the video they did on fighter pilots........."
"As a freshman currently I think it's important to put it out there: ive talked to other year students and I've pretty much concluded that the quality of food in the dining commons is totally different from year to year. For example two years ago Ortega was good while dlg was shit, but this year it's opposite in the opinion of most freshman. Never heard anything good about portola though...which is another downside about ft"
Fuck yeah! Drinking Remy's juices keeps me so hydrated
Add Tom Scott to your general explanation list.
Mostly for home computing and yes an HDMI port is a must.
