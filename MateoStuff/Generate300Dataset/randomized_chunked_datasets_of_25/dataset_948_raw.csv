"Well, I am finishing my master's degree in Economics. I hope you like math.

Edit : PM me if you have questions!

Edit 2 : I'll detail my post a bit more. 

""Economics"" is a very very broad field : it can mix up sociology, history, geography and of course statistics and math. 

Don't worry about your specification yet, the first years of college will be very general and are just here to confirm you actually like economics (in my uni, about 70% of the students drop in the first year).

The basics are (at least for me) really not that interesting. IS-LM (since you are talking about Macroeconomics) will likely be the first model you will learn, and it is entirely false. It doesn't matter, models often are.

If you are interested in this field, you should be at ease with math (it's getting completely crazy on the third or fourth year) and be curious. 

The jobs opportunities are endless, but specialized. Be sure not to major in a dead-end specialization (I took microeconomics and econometrics, I'll probably work in a statistics-related field).

No pressure though, I'm finishing my fourth year and I am not yet sure of what I'll do next (probably going for the Ph.D)"
I forgot about that Prince Shakur album. That one was pretty good.
"I would be cautious for sure, I've never shared them on reddit but I've shared with other developers who I thought were just wanting to casually look at the app but later I found out a few I shared links with were actually making many google accounts and 1 staring the app basically out of jealously and competition. 

The community on reddit seems decent though, but still, I would be careful who you share your app with, for all you know they could submit a fake DMCA or anything."

A great euro that gets a lot of bang for the buck is Castles of Burgundy.

Another one that sees a lot of table time for us is Power Grid."
"a nice nordic country, sweden or finland or Norway or Denmark. They dont get very warm, good social policies that seem to work."
I'm also aware of that but do you really think the guy asking this question cares about those details. From what I read it didn't seem like he knew much about monitors so I tried to keep my answer pretty basic and not flood him with information. Like most things monitors are a very complex topic when you look into it and not everyone cares or needs to learn every single thing about them.

"It's interesting that Ynab, a tiny company started ten years ago by one man in his spare time, is going head-to-head with relatively huge companies like Intuit with Mint, with success. And without any advertising. By relying purely on word of mouth, it means that everybody recommending Ynab must be happy with it."
"As far as quality goes, probably Verizon. But also, pretty much any telecomm in the USA is overpriced shit."
"Go if you are okay with 
1. thicker bezels compared to iPhone 12 and up
2. Lcd display
3. Slightly thicker and weighing body
4. Good enough camera in well lit conditions. When compared to 11 and up it can’t really compete. 

If i am a person who don’t get lured to latest models every year and stick with one device for more than 3 years then i will buy device which will be futuristic. Based on this point IPhone 12 or at least 11 is better choice compared to xr.

Meanwhile performance and quality wise xr is already a top notch. But i am not sure if i can say this beyond ios15."
Are you sure? This is *DMX* we're talking about here.
