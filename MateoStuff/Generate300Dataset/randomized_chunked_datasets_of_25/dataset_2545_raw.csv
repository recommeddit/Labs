"> New Orleans is a great party town. Get drunk, try some of the local food. It is everything Vegas pretends to be, but is genuine.

"Ah....the question as old as time.  They are so comparable that it's hard to make a distinction really, but it really depends on what you are shopping for.

The Lowe's closes to me could have a friendlier staff, but I'll never forget that after hurricane Katrina, when it was difficult to even get out of my neighborhood because there were so many trees blown down and blocking the roads, it was Lowe's that was going door-to-door passing out free blue tarpaulins to people that had holes in their roofs.  That sort of thing makes an impression on a person in time of need."
All true!  Hehe :D

Oh my god Dinosaur Bar B Que... good choice!
mostly midnight commander and sometimes caja because I'm on mate and it is lightweight enough and native for mate. Can filezilla be considered as file manager? :)

"Nope. Nspire Calculator is too much for calculus. Way too complicated to calculate a simple problem that probably can be done faster by hand. Honestly, ti-36x pro is good enough.

I would suggest using a basic scientific calculator  and work problems out by hand so you can better prepare for exams. Calculators are usually not allowed on exams, at least it was for my class. 

Unless you are planning on taking statistics, or Linear Algebra, you don’t really need any fancy graphing calculator."

I would have gone with Xs Max in your case. That's what I did when I was deciding to upgrade to X.
"I was neighbors at a beach near Wilmington with Robert Downey Jr. for a week while he was filming Iron Man 3. I only met him on the beach once, but he was a really nice guy. My friend and I were flying a kiteboarding kite on the beach when he approached us from behind and initiated a conversation with “hey guys, cool kite!”

He’s much shorter in person, too."
"Disney Pooh seems like a right twat.

AA Milne Pooh was a gentleman and a scholar.  Well, scratch the scholar."
Dragons Dogma and Persona 5
"Are they always coloured this semi-transparent?
Because on their website you can only buy a black one but the pictures are the same on Amazon with this transparent Design"
Typically in classes you aren’t allowed to use your phone
"Start at Manistee, follow M110 to Onekama and then take M22 to Traverse City."
I got it to work. I can try out firefox and see if I like it.
Worst disappointment of my gaming life. Terribly mediocre game.
