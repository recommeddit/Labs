16507,"Two things I learned last time I tried on sunglasses:

1. You want the glasses to stay in place when you smile. If the bottom of the lenses are too low, they'll move up. They may look fine if they're too low, but it can get uncomfortable (pressure on your cheek after a while). 

2. Don't put them on the top of your head like a headband -- it warps the hinges.",best sunglasses for fashion
52117,"I was looking for a more sturdy case than the Apple leather one, and the clerk at the store went deadpan, pulled his 6+ out of his pocket, and tossed it to the floor.

I gasped audibly, and he cracked up, then picked up his pristine phone off the ground in its [Tech21 ""impactology evo mesh"" case](http://www.amazon.com/Tech21-Impactology-Mesh-Iphone-Case/dp/B00P2JYHH6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1423946126&sr=8-2&keywords=tech21+evo+mesh).

67377,"Yea but that's not what I'm saying.  I absolutely fucking agree with you.  My entire point is that learning how an abstraction works is only going to help you better use and understand the abstraction itself.  In all honestly I meant to edit my post to mention how understanding how XHHR requests would only help you better understand how fetch works.  It really has nothing to with being a 3rd party library exclusively, its about being able to understand the fundamentals before you understand abstractions.  I mean you didn't learn react before vanilla JS did you?  I know I didn't and even if I did, it would've taken me a 5x as long to understand react as well as I do now.",axios alternatives reddit

33238,"How do you know they are inaccurate?

The EPA range estimate on the Lightning is rated while pulling a 1000 lbs load. This way people who buy the truck who pull trailers won't see their range drop like a rock. Ford is underpromising and overdelivering on range. It has a huge battery. Read the fine print.

There are multiple reports from independent people that the range is in the 350-450 range without a load. Given the size of the batteries, this would not surprise me at all. That's with the extended range battery. I imagine the basic one has a stated range of 230 and will likely get in the 300 or so empty. 

The size of vehicle isn't going to impact highway range that much.
