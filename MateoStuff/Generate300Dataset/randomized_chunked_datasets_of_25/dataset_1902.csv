13713,best research paper archive,"While I'm not claiming to be a statistical genius by any means, this paper - along with Cohen's [The Earth is Round (p < .05)](http://www.psych.yorku.ca/sp/Amer%20Psychologist%201994%20Cohen%20Earth%20is%20Round.pdf) - helped me understand the limitations of inferential statistics and subsequently to avoid poor formulation in statistical measurement and design. 

[This article](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/09/why_most_publis.html) helped clear up some the Ioannidis argument for me."
62032,Best RPG game on PS4,You literally just made me put it to re download.
12805,best gifts for mom,"Ditto. Mom of a 3 year old and 1 year old. Just no chores for one day, please."
65194,best phone service company,"I switched from Mint to TMobile (same network). Never had an issue anywhere in the country, and I've been all over."
25671,best cricket teams of all time,"West Indies didn't lose a test series at home for 22 years, also didn't lose a test series for 15 years. They won the first two world cups and finish runner up in 1983.

Steve Waugh's Australian side could be the most dominant for a five year time period, but considering West Indies longevity at the top would mean they are the greater side."
40355,best midrange GPU,"Best price to performance goes to 1660 super at $229, and the 3060 ti at $399. I think both models have seen price increases so I recommend waiting or looking on r/hardwareswap"
60383,Best comedy show on Netflix,Chewing gum is too much! Love that show 🤘🏼🤣
16507,best sunglasses for fashion,"Two things I learned last time I tried on sunglasses:

1. You want the glasses to stay in place when you smile. If the bottom of the lenses are too low, they'll move up. They may look fine if they're too low, but it can get uncomfortable (pressure on your cheek after a while). 

2. Don't put them on the top of your head like a headband -- it warps the hinges."
52117,best iphone case,"I was looking for a more sturdy case than the Apple leather one, and the clerk at the store went deadpan, pulled his 6+ out of his pocket, and tossed it to the floor.

I gasped audibly, and he cracked up, then picked up his pristine phone off the ground in its [Tech21 ""impactology evo mesh"" case](http://www.amazon.com/Tech21-Impactology-Mesh-Iphone-Case/dp/B00P2JYHH6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1423946126&sr=8-2&keywords=tech21+evo+mesh). I bought one on the spot, and have used it ever since with great satisfaction (though I haven't had the guts to throw my phone to the ground yet). $30 on Amazon, though I think I paid a bit more at the Apple Store."
49017,best gaming monitor,"Keep in mind, the F at the end denotes freesync. Without the F is G-sync"
43135,best detective show,I couldn’t believe that when I first heard it
62216,Best RPG game on PS4,"Fallout 4, skyrim, alien isolation, borderlands"
27684,best bollywood actor,Nope. I think he can pull off any character. I feel like he is someone who could do any role better than the original actors but I don’t think any other actor can play any of Ranbir’s role better than Ranbir. This is my personal opinion.
67377,axios alternatives reddit,"Yea but that's not what I'm saying.  I absolutely fucking agree with you.  My entire point is that learning how an abstraction works is only going to help you better use and understand the abstraction itself.  In all honestly I meant to edit my post to mention how understanding how XHHR requests would only help you better understand how fetch works.  It really has nothing to with being a 3rd party library exclusively, its about being able to understand the fundamentals before you understand abstractions.  I mean you didn't learn react before vanilla JS did you?  I know I didn't and even if I did, it would've taken me a 5x as long to understand react as well as I do now."
41360,best instrument to play,1971 Rhodes Suitcase Electric Piano. No contest.
33238,best electric car,"How do you know they are inaccurate?

The EPA range estimate on the Lightning is rated while pulling a 1000 lbs load. This way people who buy the truck who pull trailers won't see their range drop like a rock. Ford is underpromising and overdelivering on range. It has a huge battery. Read the fine print.

There are multiple reports from independent people that the range is in the 350-450 range without a load. Given the size of the batteries, this would not surprise me at all. That's with the extended range battery. I imagine the basic one has a stated range of 230 and will likely get in the 300 or so empty. 

The size of vehicle isn't going to impact highway range that much.

16441,best sunglasses for fashion,"Serious question: outside of the second image, who on Earth would wear these except folks trying to make a statement wearing sunglasses inside?"
5702,best programming language for web development,Out of ruby php & python which do you think has the least competition? Should I look into mysql as well? I did some sql in college and know how basic queries operate.
7908,best laptop for general use,HP Envy X360(AMD 4500U) or Lenovo Flex 5
69844,best major to study in college,"So you said you work outside, see beautiful scenery, work in the rain, crawl through bushes, but can you explain more of what you actually do? Like, what is a typical day for you? I've been interested in forestry for a long time, but I've never really been sure of what I could do with it."

65851,best college in california,"UCLA and Cal are .

Your still paying 50k a year ..."
3768,best college for research,[cough] china [cough]
58370,best cologne,"I think Burberry's Brit for men is the best I've smelled so far and would find the smell sexy on a man but smell is a very personal thing so I don't know if a man would like it as well. I smelled it in the store and not actually on a man, so I can't say  I thought of it as a manly smell, it was just a really, really good one."
