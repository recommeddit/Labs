1650 super is a great choice but in OPs case he has more than enough money to get himself something better which a 1660 super is great for his needs. If you are in that type of scenario where your budget is very tight or you just need a new working GPU then 1650 super is a great choice.
I started streaming in 2013 on a PS2 Eye Toy and used it as my mic too LOL... eventually moved up to a logitech c270 for a year or so then switch to the c920 for the rest of my streaming career
"Thank you. I have always 'called' my wallet and keys. ""Here WalletWalletWallet, here KeysKeysKeys."" So it seemed natural to attach a tile to something that WOULD come when I called.

 Protip- The tile sings a little song as it looks for its mates. A few treat parties for your dog while your tile sings avoids massive confusion and or anxiety for the dog later. 

Source- I have two dogs, only acclimated one. I guess if my neck started to sing a song without me I'd be disturbed too."
"Definitely schedule some time for Skydive California in Tracy! Great place for all skill levels and the DZO and staff are the best people. Great facilities and nice big landing area. Skydance and Byron also have busy fun jumper scenes. If you have time, check all of them out. Byron (Skydive NorCal) and Tracy aren't too far apart from one another either."
This is an interesting ranking system. What was your reason for not including the Forbes college ranking list?
"Lots of people offer to help without actually following up on it, or want to do things that don't need to be done. Coordinating groups of people and releases is still a sizeable amount of work (ask your manager/team lead) and at the end of the day, Axios isn't what pays their bills. This is a problem across open source: there's no funding model, so the whole ecosystem is built off donated time and burnout.

I'd also point out, the spirit of open source is that the code is all available to you. If there's a fix you need, you can merge the code yourself on your fork."
"I used to be a cheap sunglasses person, but I bought myself two nice pairs and I looove them - unfortunately, I left my [burgundy ones](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/accessories/sunglasses/balmain-oversize-embellished-sunglasses?sid=m9gvbv&utm_source=polyvore&utm_medium=shopping&cvosrc=cse.polyvore.polyvore&sid=o6rufs) on a plane and never got them back, so I just have my [navy ones](https://bossmanshades.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Balmain-2024-Sunglasses-Frame-NAVY-Lens-Color-Gradient-Grey-BL202402-0.jpg)


I also have a pair (somewhere ...) of prescription aviators, but I always wear contacts so they aren't very useful.


It feels like everyone has been snapped up by Luxxotica, so I'll be creeping this thread to find a proper sunglass source."

Yeah and we narrowly lost the Euro final on penalties after a World Cup semi final exit. Not sure this current crop of players (which the value here represents) can be criticised for underperforming. Give them another 2 or 3 tournaments and judge them then.
The fact that Pele didn't play in Europe (to the best of my knowledge) is also a huge knock on him because the Brazilian league has never been that great.
"Most toothpastes say that simply because some kids don't realize that they shouldn't be swallowing toothpastes. It's not that there's anything particularly harmful in it, but rather, because the concentration of fluoride in toothpaste is meant for topical application, not ingestion, and can cause some mild indigestion. 

As far as it's effects on pregnancy... I'm not qualified to comment on that."
I like to send my mom flowers at work so she can brag about how great her son is. I think she enjoys lording her giant arrangement over the other mothers.  ... we're kind of bad people?
"I cannot recall ever learning about this conflict in the American public school system in the 1980s and 90s. If it was mentioned they just glossed over it, because I donâ€™t remember it at all."

I think you misspelled Me Against The World?
If you have any local distilleries nearby check with them or online for distilleries. The moonshine ones in Tennessee were making and selling batches of hand sanitizer.

I like The Game because the whole time you're thinking everything is just part of the game but it makes you doubt it but then you realize it's just a part of the game but then it makes you doubt it but then you realize it must just be a part of the game but then at the end if makes you doubt it.

"Do you have any idea of what you're even talking about? Don't just spew shit to sound cool on a social media site. There are thousands of people in India who forgo careers in high paying jobs in order to perform research in science and engineering. A portion of them may be making minor improvements to existing ideas but that doesn't mean that they(much less all of us) are ""stealing western research"". Grow the fuck up dude
E: All that said, I AM a but surprised to see so many Indian institutes on the map. I expected only a handful because research costs money, which is hard to come by in India. There are very few well funded universities in India but they're top notch in research when it comes to certain fields."
"Plant a ginseng crop that is what a friend of mine did. Should be good to go in about 5 years. He also planted a bunch of different fruit trees in that area too. Hopefully in about 5 years the ginseng would be ready, but as for the trees it is more like 10 years.  That and if you got deer you have to protect your little trees from those bastards. They eat everything down to the nub."
