62885,Best Data Science textbook,yeah how do you do this besides experience...often times you only have one shot...one opportunity
26280,best politician,Winston Churchill was easily the most quotable.
15717,best sunglasses for fashion,"They also make really good prescription sunglasses. 

My prescription is +5 so the lenses are thicker. Cubitts offer high index lenses which reduce the thickness -- though it costs extra.

My favorite is the [Granville](https://www.cubitts.co.uk/sunglasses/granville?color=black)"
35150,best NFL player,"Do they really? That's an awful lot of time between getting votes in November and then releasing the list in August.

And this is a list of best players going into 2021, right? Doesn't make sense to vote in November and then ignore the most important part of the season."
56791,best desktop monitor,"I've been incredibly happy with [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TQQN2GI/ref=twister_B00UWMLSHU?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1).  I have the 25 inch version.  It's solid, 1080p 60 Hz.  Nothing extraordinary, but does what I need."
52754,best hiphop album,"Like you said opinions are subjective and for me the older stuff is my favourite/what I listen too so therefore it's going to pop up onto my opinion of the best albums. And dude I'm not saying ANYTHING from ANYTIME shouldn't be on here lets discuss what are some of the releases from the last decade or so that you feel should earn a place. My answers reflect my taste as a fan, I don't need to try and pretend to know anything, I'm a fan of the culture that's number 1. 
So what's your thoughts on best of all time man?"
21535,best winnie the pooh comic,DAT USERNAME
48088,best color to paint with,[look at those monsters with their avocado coloured bathroom fixtures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWoWHzq21tA)
68003,best science fiction novel,I would up vote for Snow Crash since that is one of my all time favorites but his name is Stephenson. I want him to get little respect for his fantastic work and a person who does not know about Snow Crash will be looking for the wrong author.
43272,best detective show,"Voice, Tunnel,  Ghost (Korean series.)"
14680,best romantic novel,"I liked the In Death series. It's very formulaic and becomes a bit repetitive, so I am very slowly reading the series. As in it's been 2 years and I've finished 9 of the books.

My favourites for romance are **Outlander**, anything by **Christina Lauren**, the **Mastered** series by Lorelei James, and **The Hating Game** by Sally Thorne. Oh and for cheesy sweet romance that's better than Nora Roberts, I like a few series by Jill Shalvis, like **Lucky Harbor** and **Animal Magnetism**. 

All of my favourites have quality writing, hunky heroes, and reasonably believable relationships."
27838,best breakfast foods,When I married my wife it was understood that she enjoyed the sausage gravy and biscuits.  4 years later she gets pregnant.  She STOPS LIKING THE BISCUITS AND GRAVY!  Now anytime I make it i have to hear about how she hates even the smell.  LIfe sucks.
32749,best vacation resort,"It's too late for me to not look like a dick in this thread...oh, well...but honestly, my initial post to OP was meant to be more of a ""hey, are you fully aware of all the options available?"" more than ""your plans are dumb.""

But to your ""constant flow of beer"" comment...there are a zillion places you can do this for the same price or less without being cooped up in a resort.

Beers are just over $1 here in Puerto Escondido...you can have a more authentic experience while getting shit canned for next to nothing - best of both worlds.

Or look into Lake Atitlan...awesome party scene with incredible opportunities to climb volcanoes and visit gorgeous colonial towns."
49628,best gaming monitor,"The monitor performs fine at 165Hz. The problem lies with Nvidia’s Windows drivers, and is a known issue that is still not fully solved, especially for older cards (I’m on Pascal)."
7023,best iPhone,"Yep. The iPhone 11 is seen as the iPhone for everyone and anyone. 

The iPhone XR was seen as a budget iPhone. 

The name can have a significant effect on the product, especially for Apple where it relies on its name so much."
8506,best toothpaste,You guys get samples from reps like MD doctors?
744,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,Butter Pecan is Underrated.  Awareness must be brought to the people.
7634,best laptop for general use,"I don’t want a heavy laptop, and a decent battery life would be nice. Not sure what you mean by build quality though."
31492,best hotel to live in,My guess is he just means the Oberoi in Navi Mumbai....I would second the opinion that it was the best hotel I ever stayed in if we are talking about the same one... Truly amazing
54392,best artisan mousepad alternatives,The pads are worth but the shipping in EU is horrible and they won't do anything to improve it...
42980,best detective show,Person of Interest is really good! On Netflix.
37494,best amusement park,SF MF MM
47270,best state to visit in the United States,Heh. Keeps out the lightweights.
