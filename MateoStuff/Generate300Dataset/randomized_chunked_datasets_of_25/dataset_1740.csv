35912,"I've read a few places that carbonated water is good for helpgin your body turn acetaldehyde into acetate, meaning you don't get hangover symptoms the next day. 

I'll be damned if I can't go ridiculously ham while drinking club soda in between, then wake up the next morning with no symptoms. I'd say it could be just luck but I've done it so many times that it's not longer just anecdote to me.

Here's just one article, it has links to the study and stuff, I just wanna show I'm not talking out of my ass http://greatist.com/health/best-hangover-cure-soda-101013",best alcoholic drink

3418,"I still have and use a C270- it's fine for a face cam and if you have(had) poorer internet like me it's likely you can only pump out good 720p.  I started streaming with a dual core laptop with AMD graphics just to see if I liked it  (Not games though... when I attempted that for a week or two the computer overheated) and upgraded PCs when things got really moving.

Some of the fastest growing game based content creators I've seen don't even have a webcam.  As long as your voice sounds decent, and your content has enough pixels, it's all about your personality really. 

I would definitely say that you should start doing more than you should be theorising.  A lot of my initial thoughts about streaming changed (and continue to change) as I'm doing it longer and longer.",best webcamera
