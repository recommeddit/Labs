46781,"That's hospital-grade stuff, suitable for surgical hand disinfection.  It'll kill most viruses and bacteria in 15 seconds of application, including tuberculosis, herpes, salmonella, listeria, HIV, influenza, and rotavirus.

But typical vodka is only 40 to 50% alcohol, so even my cheapo generic sanitizer has that beat.  Your sanitizer beats out even 151-proof rum.  You'd need to go to 190-proof grain alcohol to beat your sanitizer.

55026,"Mount Katahdin in Maine is, by far, the best hike on the East Coast.

The Presidential Traverse of the White Mountains in New Hampshire is nice as well.

Mount Colden via the Trap Dike in the Adirondacks in New York is a very unique experience.

For short hikes with beautiful scenery and unique trails check, out Acadia National Park along the coast of Maine and Mohonk Mountain House along the Shawangunk Ridge in New York (less than 2 hours from NYC). The Shawangunks also have world-renowned rock climbing routes. 

Another short hike with dramatic scenery is Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire (about 2 hours from Boston). It is the 2nd most climbed mountain in the world.

Old Rag Mountain in Virginia (about 2 hours from DC) is overrated. Instead, head a couple hours further west to West Virginia for the dramatic scenery of Seneca Rocks and the nearby Chimney Top via North Fork Mountain.

Further south, there isn't much in the way of prominent mountain tops with truly unobstructed 360-degree views, but the Alum Cave Trail in the Great Smoky Mountains is really cool. 

The summit of Bell Mountain is Georgia can be accessed by car. It has dramatic views (almost 360 degrees but not quite) and colorfully painted rocks.",best places to hike in the east coast

47306,"Literally any city, but I find it ironic you've heard LA/LV are no good, because they're 2 of my favorite, they have 24/7 entertainment and things like Disneyland and Universal in LA, while LV is near the Grand Canyon and can keep you busy at least a few days on the strip. 

My order would be Los Angeles, Chicago, NYC, Las Vegas, and Miami. If you heard LA/LV are bad you might as well skip everything on that list because they're all bad. 

Cities like Dallas, Phoenix, and Houston all have enough to keep someone busy a few days. Like Phoenix is driving distance to the Grand Canyon, and in my opinion the most beautiful place on Earth, Sedona.",best state to visit in the United States
