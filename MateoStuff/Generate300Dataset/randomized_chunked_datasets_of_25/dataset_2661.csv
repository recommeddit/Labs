40733,best instrument to play,"Electronic synthesizers.

With some technical knowledge you can design completely new kinds of instruments and expression. You can just make them sound funny and weird, too. You don't even need to buy expensive software/hardware: you can grab any free VST capable music application and rape it with one out of thousands of free VST synthesizers available."

62634,Best RPG game on PS4,"Depends on what youâ€™re looking for. Itâ€™s incredibly well written, does a really good job of managing its tone (so things never feel absurdly out of place, but also you never have that heavy feeling from reading/playing a never ending serious story.) Failing at something you try to do is usually amusing, and (almost) never stops you from moving forward. Itâ€™s an interesting story/plot, and well done as a murder mystery. The world is very different and interesting. The leveling system integrates thematically with the story. All that being said, itâ€™s not gonna be interesting if you want fights. Or high fantasy. Or a power fantasy. Those things are great, but this isnâ€™t that. Disco Elysium feels unique to some degree."
45669,best trick or treating candy,I want candy corn just so I can [turn it into homemade Butterfinger bars.](http://candy.about.com/od/halloweencandyrecipes/r/Candy-Corn-Peanut-Butter-Bars.htm)
3714,best college for research,"I agree completely.  And regarding your last sentence: this is the other side of the same coin. ""Boring"" or tedious validation is hardly being rewarded, similar to more ""far out"" ideas, regardless whether or not they prove to be innovative in hindsight. In this respect, academic competition means getting ahead WITHIN the mainstream consensus view - mainly by not questioning it too much. And while not without its merits, I feel that this model produces a lot of unintended consequences. I would love to do a 10 year experiment of scientific micro-environments in which these classic notions of competition are suspended."

48309,best color to paint with,"What a shitty tip. If you have already chosen your furniture, linens and curtains, chances are you have already bought them, since you want to be sure they don't sell out or because you get a good deal on them. Where do you put them? In your new home, where you'll regret not painting BEFORE you start filling the room up."
