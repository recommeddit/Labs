62634,"Depends on what youâ€™re looking for. Itâ€™s incredibly well written, does a really good job of managing its tone (so things never feel absurdly out of place, but also you never have that heavy feeling from reading/playing a never ending serious story.) Failing at something you try to do is usually amusing, and (almost) never stops you from moving forward. Itâ€™s an interesting story/plot, and well done as a murder mystery. The world is very different and interesting. The leveling system integrates thematically with the story. All that being said, itâ€™s not gonna be interesting if you want fights. Or high fantasy. Or a power fantasy. Those things are great, but this isnâ€™t that. Disco Elysium feels unique to some degree.",Best RPG game on PS4

""Boring"" or tedious validation is hardly being rewarded, similar to more ""far out"" ideas, regardless whether or not they prove to be innovative in hindsight. In this respect, academic competition means getting ahead WITHIN the mainstream consensus view - mainly by not questioning it too much. And while not without its merits, I feel that this model produces a lot of unintended consequences. I would love to do a 10 year experiment of scientific micro-environments in which these classic notions of competition are suspended.",best college for research
