In my defense, she’s written a ton of books and I’ve read almost all of them in the last year, so they’re fresh in my mind. There’s almost always at least one of her books that fits a requested trope. MC? Check. Alpha? Check. Second-chance? Check. Law enforcement? Check. Athlete? Check. Musician? Check. Shy heroine? Check. Sassy heroine? Check. 

Lately, I have been holding back recommending her as much. Even if it doesn’t seem like it! Bwa.

ETA: I have never read Alexis Hall or Klune. What titles would you recommend? Clearly I need to expand my horizons.",best romantic novel
