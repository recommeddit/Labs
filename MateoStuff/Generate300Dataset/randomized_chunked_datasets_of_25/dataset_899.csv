27583,"He doesn't even give interview generally when his movie is not releasing. 

Why people ignore that he generally says that he is not natural actor and there are much more powerful actors out there.  

He also says that he is not perfectionists, all these tags were given by media because og the dialogues in movies

SRK has Badshah movie
Aamir had prefection  dialogue in Dil Chahta hai
Slaman got Bhai tag from Tere naam. 

Media likes to tag people with certain adjectives, that doesn't necessary make that actors are pushing it.  You can says that Aamir pushing it by doing only one movie at a time, but that doesn;t make any sense to lose so much money just to maintain a tag.",best bollywood actor

If Tesla battery day has some cool tech announcements on charging/longevity, man, Tesla is the one to beat.  That supercharger network has appeal, esp for one car households and in your case, limited charging at home.
