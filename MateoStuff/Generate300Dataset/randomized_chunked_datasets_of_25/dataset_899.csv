27583,best bollywood actor,"He doesn't even give interview generally when his movie is not releasing. 

Why people ignore that he generally says that he is not natural actor and there are much more powerful actors out there.  

He also says that he is not perfectionists, all these tags were given by media because og the dialogues in movies

SRK has Badshah movie
Aamir had prefection  dialogue in Dil Chahta hai
Slaman got Bhai tag from Tere naam. 

Media likes to tag people with certain adjectives, that doesn't necessary make that actors are pushing it.  You can says that Aamir pushing it by doing only one movie at a time, but that doesn;t make any sense to lose so much money just to maintain a tag."

33210,best electric car,"Nissan Leaf fits certain use cases.  Depending on tax credits and daily miles, the budget numbers might make sense.  Build quality is well Nissan, not an issue.

In a Leaf lease right now and the next one will be a used Leaf plus or a Tesla but that's a budget stretch, considering my relatively low per day mile use case.

If Tesla battery day has some cool tech announcements on charging/longevity, man, Tesla is the one to beat.  That supercharger network has appeal, esp for one car households and in your case, limited charging at home.  

(Note: Previous car was a leased Chevy Volt plug in, 1st gen (really liked that car) and before was a Honda Accord (also a trouble free car but not EV at all so meh)."

16850,best pet for toddlers,"Not all rabbits are like this, just so you know. 

I've known several, all owned by close friends. One is a joy (we actually fostered her for a week), one is a turd and does as he pleases, and one reaaaaaally doesn't like to be touched, despite frequently handling when he was young.

Ya just never know. Not to mention their diets are very specific and over-doing it on fruits and carrots can actually make them very sick."

54283,best medicine for a cold,"Adding... zinc totally helps, I use it frequently... Go to the pharmacy, get a bottle from the vitamin aisle, take 1 pill/day as early as possible, you prob won't need more than 2 days worth. It will not make you lose smell (from personal experience this has never been the case). But make sure you take that shit with food, or it will make you puke. No joke."

On a side note, does anyone know if Luxottica produces Warby Parker in Japan, or if it's a situation like TNF Purple Label, as Optec Japan is listed as the parent company for the Japanese Warby Parker line, and can anyone speak to their quality? I've handled them in Japan and liked them, but didn't have much time to check them out in detail."
