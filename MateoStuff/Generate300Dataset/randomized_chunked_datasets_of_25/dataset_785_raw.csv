"As a former paint store employee, this is the worst! Tinting 12 little plastic bottles is a pain, and we sell those things below cost!"
"Not really, but you'll feel that way after your 11th one."
"Ugh, I remember a story on here a few months ago about him. The person's friend, this small asian woman, was a huge fan of his. She saw him in Vegas taking pictures with all of these hot women and walked up to ask for an autograph. Completely ignoring her is dickish enough, but on top of that he put his hand on her face, pushed her out of his way and walked off."
"It was a gift I gave her almost as an afterthought. A small candid Polaroid picture of myself laughing at some dumb joke on set. I had it framed and tossed it into her stocking. Out of all of her presents that year, she loves that one the most. She keeps it on her desk to remind her that even though she worries about me being so far away, I'm doing what I love and having a great time doing it."
UAG   I’ve been using these cases for a long time on a few different iPhones and have never had one break. And I seem to drop them a lot lol. Plus the monarch has a 10 year warranty
A lacrosse ball as well! Get them glutes people!

Try on at least 15 pairs of shoes at the running store.  Don’t avoid any brands and go with what feels best on your feet.  The more you run the more you will know what you need in a shoe.
Monoprice should be this list. Monoprice.com
"If it's ""spring water"" it likely was bottled from the same sources. Crystal Geyser is also from the same sources as Poland spring I believe."
How about a few 10mm sockets and wrenches?
"How has nobody yet said country fried steak??? With eggs, hash browns, and lots of gravy. I'm drooling."

"I can go on and on about this lol ill try and real it in.  Tabs show you how, but not why.  They enable you to learn songs without knowing things like what notes you're playing, what key you are in, or possibly without even understanding what I mean by ""key"".  

Over time, your guitar playing skills out-develop your overall understanding of what's going on, which is fine its not like this is some sort of established rule.  But if you're looking to take the next step particularly in a theory direction, then you need to start looking at tabs as cheating.  Sometimes you gotta cheat, dont get me wrong, but you get the idea.    

Now I'm no demon studio guitarist over here, but I can hold my own improvise-wise and I like to come up with my own progressions and riffs.  When I do that sort of stuff I'm thinking about things like rhythm, scales, key, what I just played, what I'm about to play... EVERYTHING, but certainly not the fret numbers.  

If you're looking for suggestions, id say wrap your head around what a key is.  If you enjoy sight reading, run with that, but I do not.  What helped me was I took one key signature: G major.  That's my key.  Learn that key.  learn the notes, learn where they are on the guitar, and then learn what chords go with those notes.  Id be happy to talk you through that, but only if you are interested."

"Bernie Sanders. He's New deal democrat in an era where all the politicians are either moderate Republican or so far right they are off the spectrum(sorry about backing out of the Paris climate agreement and bumping up our carbon emissions btw)

"the 11 Pro is the first phone where i don’t feel like i need the newer model. it’s the first time i’ve felt like there’s nothing wrong with it. amazing display, cameras, build, battery life, speakers are pretty good, plus i’m jailbroken so i have all that extra stuff. instead of an iPhone 12 i’m buying applecare+ and i’ll get the iPhone 13."
"Oop! You've got me there, completely slipped my mind!"
"So I tried the technique of juicing and using the pulp for the first time, and it was super successful! I also juiced some apple and cucumber separately and made a batch of fritters with those--they're basically cookies minus sugar, and are also awesome."
"We play 4 players, and it usually takes about 3 hours per scenario. That does include some set up time, which we often do pretty slowly, as we're socializing and chatting about other things."
I read Financial Times and Barron's
Rechargeable fork. Never again be at dinner and have to go buy a new one.
Good news. Use Great Suspender and Session Buddy so you'll completely forget about those tabs in a few weeks.
This. Very true.
