"Spigen Ultra Hybrid. Hands down best case I've used. Had it on my 5c, 5s and 6. I'll probably never use another case. Cheap, comfortable to use and great

"Any back end language would do, be it Python or Java, or something completely different."
"Just another update. I took the plunge and installed MS Word / MS OneNote. The pressure sensitivity actually works great. They are useless for manipulating PDFs, however - Word ""converts"" the PDF via some online service... into a buggy mess. OneNote imports it OK, but can't export it right.

Bears fan and no Walter Payton... sad!

"I watch national treasure 2 the other night and thought damn I miss movies like this, real action, car chases ect. I love superhero movies still but there is something to be said for a more realistic adventure  movie."

I moved here and can't say I see it. The mountains are okay. They're nice but the natives fucking ruin the entire experience really. They're straight up dickbags to everyone.
