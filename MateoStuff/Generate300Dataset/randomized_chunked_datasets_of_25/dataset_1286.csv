64079,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"I'm going camping next week too.

203,best terminal file manager reddit,"`ranger` is the best!  Built to be easy to customize, with sensible defaults, and written in `python` (for further customization ease if you know python).  Beware that ranger can sometimes be a bit weird about error messages.

If you use `emacs -nw`, then `dired` is also a viable option."

12313,best gifts for mom,"Thanks.  There's a store here in St Paul called Northern Brewer and they have start up kits that a bit more complex versus the amazon or groupon home brew kits.  
A box for $30 makes 48 bottles.  

Does that sound like more a reasonable buy? 

Edit: I meant the $30 ingredient box.  
The start up kit is $90 - $140.  

I think I'll go get it today while I have some time off"
38032,best Marvel movie,Someone could give me this as their top 10 and I wouldn't really argue with it. Though Doctor Strange over Infinity War is hard to swallow. And I'd have BP around 4 or 5. One of the best movies in the MCU but not top 3.
