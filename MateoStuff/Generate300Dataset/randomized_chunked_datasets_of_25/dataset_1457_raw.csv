*Terminator: Genisys* had a pretty interesting plot twist. Too bad it was blown in the second trailer.
"> UCSC was basically closed for a quarter before COVID due to grad student strikes

What in the world are you talking about?

The grad strikes only completely closed campus for a handful of days total, something that is not at all uncommon at UCSC. Only 20% of grades were late."

Every instrument is hard to master. Some instruments are harder to start and get to the point and get to the point where a you can make sounds that any would want to listen to. I think brass and double reeds are difficult for beginners. Keyboard instruments probably have the highest skill ceiling.
"Yea, I think I have the same recs, if you budget is under 200$, get the pc38x, if you can pay up a little more, 560s + dac/amp in one (k5 pro), then you will be in very good hands."
Microsoft is planning to release most of its major exclusives on PC anyway. Just buy the PS4 if you absolutely have to have a console. Or just borrow one from a friend. That's what I did when I wanted to play the last of us.
Also a glass of IRN-BRU!

"Got to love a good G & T!

Tanqueray and tonic with a nice squeeze of lime.
Or
Hendricks and tonic with a slice of cucumber. 

Fever Tree or Fentimans for the tonic if they have it."

"No doubt they are crowd pullers, and I’m even a fan of both, but the guys I listed at the top are more consistent. If I had to list them based on superstardom, then they’d be on top. I’m not saying they can’t act, they’re just not as good as those guys imo."
I left out Sangakkara as well.

"There are small differences, like 922 is slightly better for low lighting areas. In my personal case this was relevant, but to be fair personify is actually the worst software and I tend to never use it"
Only Connect is amazing.
this is a good one
I prefer graphite holders to a pencil. They hold a point better and last forever. The model doesnt really matter. http://www.amazon.com/Sanford-Turquoise-Lead-Holder/dp/B00076MAUK/ref=sr_1_3?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1338076219&sr=1-3

"Justified. Technically it's not a comedy, but there's plenty of comedy in with all the violence...of which there is plenty. Great writing, great casting, even tertiary characters are well written and well acted. I just finished my second run of it, and I enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first."
