"I live in a suburb of L.A. and there's a couple local neighborhood newspapers I read, they're published twice a week.  

I also read The Week magazine.  Great stuff."
"> Basically Brady added Joe Montana's career over the past 11 years.

Insane.

And he is still going."
Birch. Birch beer reminds me of 90s Fuddruckers.
"Thanks for the advice! Unfortunately, we have a very tight schedule because we only have two weeks and want to drive to SF, Yosemite (if it hasn't burn down until next week... ) and LV. We ruled out the Universal Studios because we all are not that into movies and we think Disney land is too expensive and we'd rather see some more of LA while we are here. 


Oh and I'm glad you liked Germany :-)"
Wait ok re: the baking soda thing... I use arm & hammer toothpaste mainly bc it's dirt cheap and I'm poor af. It has baking soda in it.......... Should I stop??
"Read all of Frank's book (the first 6) and burn all of Brian's. Frank Herbert's series was epic. Admittedly, many questions were left unanswered, as he died before he could wrap things up. Brian's works could be used for toilet paper and I still think it'd be a waste. Rarely have I put a book down before finishing it; it took me just a few chapters to determine that whatever story was behind it, it wasn't worth fighting through the writing style that Brian and Kevin J Anderson displayed."
"Well my dad used to have an NES when the first came out. Him and I used to play it all the time until it broke.  My mom ended up throwing it away.  This last Monday I walked in a game store and found one with new internal parts that works.  I grabbed it, an extra controller, and a mario cartridge. I'm gonna have them set up to go for when he wakes up the day after Father's Day (which is actually his birthday)."
These [Camo sunglasses](http://www.sunglassesdiscountoff.us/cheap-oakley-sunglasses-outlet/fake-camo-oakleys-for-cheap.html) are favorite. I am happy with these amazing sunglasses and I am also a big fan of [sports](http://www.sunglassesdiscountoff.us/cheap-oakley-sunglasses-outlet/fake-oakley-sport-sunglasses.html) and [polarized](http://www.sunglassesdiscountoff.us/cheap-oakley-sunglasses-outlet/fake-oakleys-polarized-sunglasses.html) sunglasses.
">By far the most powerful programmers editor is Slickedit. It also happens to be the most expensive at ~US$300 per seat.

Emacs is turing-complete, how much more powerful can it get? Oh, and it's free, too."
"A patchouli-bomb from another era. Try before you buy, it's not for all, but they never are, are they?"
This sub hates the chili's because they're too mainstream.
"I adore Endgame. The first hour makes you feel the weight of what happened in Infinity War. The second hour is literally called a ""time heist"" which should earn it a Pulitzer alone. And the third hour gave me the most goosebumps a film may have ever given me. It's not perfect, obviously, but maybe the most satisfying time I've ever had in a movie theatre."

"Depending on where you live, Avocados are not cheap."
"> Zen4 / Ryzen 5000 is expected to be a departure from AM4, but that's still at least 1.5 year away.

AMD stated AM4 will last until 2020 so it's pretty much dead at the end of the year. Now the question is are we getting AM4+ or AM5 next year."
"Travel insurance can be finicky when it comes to lost or stolen luggage in transit. They would rather the airline or airport paid, and the airline or airport would rather the insurance company paid. So you can end up in the middle of a dispute about who is liable.

Also, if you're carrying anything remotely valuable, the limits on travel insurance for luggage are often too low, so you'll want supplementary insurance for those items."
Battery Management System???
Happy Endings - an awesome short-lived sitcom. (Plus all the others on here!)
"I have to say Notepad++ too, although I typically use Notepad, since the lack of a need for a Windows text editor has prevented me from downloading Notepad++."
"Well, ""publish"" is a tricky word right now because there's SO MUCH romance being self-published, and I think most of my experience with absolutely terrible stuff is from self-published authors. There are some publishers/ imprints that (in my opinion) don't really care about how well a book is written, and for which the editing standards are rather lax. If a publisher offers some sort of club where you receive 3 romance novels a month, they're probably focusing more on quantity than quality. Some even have really specific requirements for their authors, which further constrains creativity and enforces uniformity. I usually have good luck with Avon books, and the opposite with Harlequin, but I can't say for certain that that's a rule and not just luck of the draw.

Also, re self-publishing, there are some good authors who eschew publishing houses and don't suffer for it. I *think* Courtney Milan is a good example of this, though I'm not positive that she's independent."
"With that comment, have to try it."
I second Wild and Wonderful Whites. The family portrayed in it is unlike anything you've ever seen.
Is it different in a way that impacts any rules or gameplay?
