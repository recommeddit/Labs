40723,"Not to be stereotypical but she was Japanese and her parents were very pushy in that regard. She played flute and danced all her life even though she didnt like either. She was good at both (spent time as a professional flutist and ballerina) and was a U.S. National champion dancer in Jazz and some other style that i cant remember. And even with all of that it wasn't enough for her parents until she became a doctor. Typical disapproving Asian parents. And she didnt say it was uncomfortable to play, that's my opinion but i have bad shoulders so that could have something to do with it.",best instrument to play

13467,"I used to use libre. It is the closest thing to how excel looked before all the huge button bullshit.  
  
But I am now solidly on the google sheets hype train. Sheets is the most user friendly of excel, libre, open office, etc (i have tried them all) and is just as powerful. Accessing them through the cloud is also a huge advantage as you can just log in from any computer. BUT I recommend turning on offline functionality. This will make calculations and updating not be such a pain.",best spreadsheet editor

6855,"iPhone X the best and the worst for me.

Used to own 4s, 6 and 7 then got myself the X.
Screen, Face ID, camera, wireless charging & fast charging are just amazing. The best iPhone for sure.

But the model I got had problems ever since.. at start it had terrible internet connectivity. My provider blamed Apple and Apple point towards my provider. 
Then out of nowhere it stopped working with my computer, iMac and MacBook. Apple said it was a problem with my MacBook (diagnostics) but it was with my iPhone.. they did replace it but the connectivity still wasn’t resolved.
Battery is not bad but far from great, I own this device for 1,5-2 years now and battery is down to 84% health.

Now waiting for the new iPhones to buy a new one. Preferably iPhone 12 pro, or might go for the smaller size (if those rumors are true).",best iPhone
