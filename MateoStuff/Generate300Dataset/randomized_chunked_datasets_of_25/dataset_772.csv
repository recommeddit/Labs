34483,best NFL player,LT never came off the field for weaknesses like Barry did. My choice is Ray Lewis.
13087,best gifts for mom,I won a $100 home sense gift card at a convention. I'll probably throw in a book with it but yeah that's it.
40723,best instrument to play,"Not to be stereotypical but she was Japanese and her parents were very pushy in that regard. She played flute and danced all her life even though she didnt like either. She was good at both (spent time as a professional flutist and ballerina) and was a U.S. National champion dancer in Jazz and some other style that i cant remember. And even with all of that it wasn't enough for her parents until she became a doctor. Typical disapproving Asian parents. And she didnt say it was uncomfortable to play, that's my opinion but i have bad shoulders so that could have something to do with it."
57962,best cologne,The best girl perfume I have ever smelled is Perry Ellis 360. I also love Ralph.. by Ralph Lauren... Mmmm it reminds me of a hot stripper I knew..
49066,best gaming monitor,"My uncle got the Acer Nitro XV272U Pbmiiprzx 27"" a few months back and he says it's amazing. It's 1440p, 144hz refresh rate, and it has an ips panel. It's kinda pricey rn, but he got it on sale at microcenter for only $330. It has amazing colors along with the 1ms response time makes this monitor top tier."
25929,best cricket teams of all time,Good point! I should have included a home and away table!
13467,best spreadsheet editor,"I used to use libre. It is the closest thing to how excel looked before all the huge button bullshit.  
  
But I am now solidly on the google sheets hype train. Sheets is the most user friendly of excel, libre, open office, etc (i have tried them all) and is just as powerful. Accessing them through the cloud is also a huge advantage as you can just log in from any computer. BUT I recommend turning on offline functionality. This will make calculations and updating not be such a pain."
58663,best cologne,"Musc Ravageur, Five o'clock au Gigembre, Floris 1962, Masculin Pluriel, Scandal Parfum Cologne, 6MAN: HTTP"
68109,best science fiction novel,"It's the first book of a series unrelated to Ilium and Olympos. :) Sounds great! It's a true classic.

I saw that you put The Stars My Destination by Bester on your top five list - I loved that book. Definitely a good pick. <3"
7792,best laptop for general use,"Oh thank you, didn't realise that was a subreddit. And thanks for the recommendations, much appreciated."
46679,best hand santizer brand,"My son is heading into grade 5. He's autistic and has high anxiety over COVID-19 and wearing a mask is difficult for him, especially for a full day at school, which at the moment is what our school has planned. I'm in Canada in an area with a low number of cases but I predict schools will close by November if not sooner."
3021,best webcamera,Go pros are pretty good webcams and bridge that gap i would say
2514,best headphones,Agreed. They're bombproof and have quite decent sound.
56790,best desktop monitor,[This monitor treats me well](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236484&cm_re=vx228h-_-24-236-484-_-Product)

21887,best winnie the pooh comic,Weren't there 2 panels before this? I remember this being slightly different
13934,best research paper archive,Google Scholar (not regular Google-- use Google Scholar)
65994,best college in california,Looks like Berkeley slipped down to 2 behind UCLA.
6855,best iPhone,"iPhone X the best and the worst for me.

Used to own 4s, 6 and 7 then got myself the X.
Screen, Face ID, camera, wireless charging & fast charging are just amazing. The best iPhone for sure.

But the model I got had problems ever since.. at start it had terrible internet connectivity. My provider blamed Apple and Apple point towards my provider. 
Then out of nowhere it stopped working with my computer, iMac and MacBook. Apple said it was a problem with my MacBook (diagnostics) but it was with my iPhone.. they did replace it but the connectivity still wasn’t resolved.
Battery is not bad but far from great, I own this device for 1,5-2 years now and battery is down to 84% health.

Now waiting for the new iPhones to buy a new one. Preferably iPhone 12 pro, or might go for the smaller size (if those rumors are true)."
48083,best color to paint with,I've actually seen a lot of red dining rooms. It works very well.
39220,best web browser,"Vivaldi has caught up with Opera and surpassed it: not only is it up to spec, all the things that made Opera great originally and were scrapped during their transition have been restored. No reason anymore to use Opera except the built-in VPN I suppose."
535,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"I use the app Microsoft Office Lens to scan paper notes my professor gives me and convert the PDF into a word doc. I then type up additional notes digitally. I know this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, but They have a bunch of options so you might want to take a look to see if something will work for you."
65832,best college in california,"It’s tough on one hand you can save for retirement so you are not a burden on your children in old age, or you can afford to send them to college. 

But short of being super wealthy I have difficulty imagining the math for both."
41949,movies like Inception,+1 Dark City is incredible and very apt for a recommendation for movies like inception (those other recs are good watches as well if you have not seen them)
17751,best Kardashian,"Ahh, thank you so much!!"
