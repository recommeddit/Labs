If youre a serious player who cares about consistency, rank, etc. Or you play in an organized team at whatever level of play, you better be ready to spent 3 weeks retraining your brain to handle the lack of static friction - force required to move. All of their pads sport this feature. Even the zero. 

This amount of speed, or, low static friction gives very little benefit to your gameplay despite feeling like it does. If you're used to a fast pad with low friction, or you grew up playing on a wood desk or something like that, artisan pads will be great for you.

But, if you're like pretty much everyone else who grew up on whatever cloth pad dad brought home from the office, or a logitech or qck, they are not worth it. They are overpriced for what you get.

I'll get hate for this, but the entire mousepad industry is a fucking joke. Anyone can get used to and play well on any surface given time. All of this marketing, all of these different surfaces? Bullshit.

All of these people swapping pads around cuz x y z? Self doubt. A pad isn't gunna save your accuracy bro. Playing the game day in and day out will. Practice. Hours. Not the mousepad.

Buy whatever mousepad is made well and has decent durability for a good price and call it a day.",best artisan mousepad alternatives

It just seems like they make them cheaply on the side in order to pull in profits for the clothing lines. If you want to get nicer sunglasses, it's probably best to look at companies that specialize in making frames and have their own independent factory.",best sunglasses for fashion
