58393,best cologne,"Came here to promote this one as well. I was briefly in a sorority in college, and we ladies all had an ongoing joke about how this fragrance was so good that it was the deal-sealer when it came to one night stands. We were only mildly joking."

7677,best laptop for general use,"/u/adough1213, I have found an error in your comment:

 > “spend more ~~then~~ [**than**] $400”

It looks like it was possible for you, adough1213, to have posted “spend more ~~then~~ [**than**] $400” instead. Unlike the adverb ‘then’, ‘than’ compares.

28582,best breakfast foods,"Oh man, the best breakfast I ever had was in Austria and Germany - they had a spread of [kaiser rolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_roll), cream cheese, ham, cheese, and jam. They also had plain yogurt, which I flavored with jam. It was magnificent."

43356,best ad service for mobile applications,"I don't share links anymore, there was a time I did and it brought a bunch of problems.

Yes ogury mediation is better, you need to disable the networks I listed though, those networks just want cheap traffic, they'll buy your USA traffic and pay you next to nothing for it, the other networks I listed pay good eCPM with volume, which is what you really want.

Ogury Mediation pays net-1 as well with a 2% fee and net-30 without fee, slightly steep but, cash flow is important."

31519,best hotel to live in,"When we were looking at hotels in Sydney, we passed up the Shangri-La and the Four Seasons for the Langham. It was the best choice. Their breakfast and afternoon tea were top notch, and the service was fantastic. The beds were excellent, and helped us get over jet lag pretty quickly."
6052,best Netflix documentary,"I Love you now Die will really take it out of you. I was so conflicted. The Cheshire Murders was originally HBO as well but one can find it easily, like on yt.
