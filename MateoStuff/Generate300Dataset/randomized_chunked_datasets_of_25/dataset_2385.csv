52172,"Are these definitive? I absolutely love this list. It’s very experimental though. For someone who just got into hip-hop, (I’m assuming this person is since they just listened to illmatic) I don’t think Danny brown is a good representation of hip-hop. Yes, it is an amazing album. It’s my favorite rap album of all time, in fact. But I’ve lived most of my life building a foundation for hip-hop, and yet it was still a little tough listening to AE for the first time. It’s rough, beautiful, intense, calming, and anxious. I do think man on the moon is definitive, you definitely have definitive albums on your list, I just think it takes some experienced ears to fully enjoy Danny brown, earl sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, I’d also put Aesop rock in that grouping. (I know you didn’t mention him, but I don’t wanna leave him unmentioned)",best hiphop album
