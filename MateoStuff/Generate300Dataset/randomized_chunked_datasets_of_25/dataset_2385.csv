23841,best car racing video game,"GRID online does have a limited amount of cosmetic and performace upgrades, but its mostly locked behind a level cap for each car. I have been playing since launch and even now with millions in cash, I cant upgrade my cars engine or drivetrain because the car needs to be a lvl50 for those mods, and im still at lvl20 on my most used car. I guess it would work better if there was a bigger online community for the game."
49576,best gaming monitor,"Exactly the same experience. I had to put a PC in the living room to play immersive games on the OLED Bc the gl850 black levels were so garbage. Now I just use it for competitive games and work, because other than contrast/black levels it’s a very good monitor."
72172,best movies with a cool twist,"this ""twist"" has so many parts wrong with it once you rewatch the movie. increased strength ability, driving a truck and gettin' beej's from disembodied heads, etc.

267,best terminal file manager reddit,"What I think they meant was that they want to be able to manage files as root, not the entire GUI, this definitely could be implemented securely. The only ""workaround"" for creating/removing files/directories as root is to open a terminal emulator and do it there."
45037,best items under $100,"I recently bought a case for my phone that is also a battery. It makes my phone thicker and heavier, but the battery adds 150 percent battery life. I've been saying for years that you could double the size of my phone if I could have a bigger battery, and more I have it and it is exactly as awesome as I imagined it to be"

Gaming + Normal usage? : Manjaro / POP!\_OS (depending on what you like more and if you need the AUR)  


Just normal usage? : POP!\_OS / KDE Neon / Fedora / openSUSE (I would recommend KDE Neon or POP!\_OS because they get the most support and are both Debian / Ubuntu based.)"
52172,best hiphop album,"Are these definitive? I absolutely love this list. It’s very experimental though. For someone who just got into hip-hop, (I’m assuming this person is since they just listened to illmatic) I don’t think Danny brown is a good representation of hip-hop. Yes, it is an amazing album. It’s my favorite rap album of all time, in fact. But I’ve lived most of my life building a foundation for hip-hop, and yet it was still a little tough listening to AE for the first time. It’s rough, beautiful, intense, calming, and anxious. I do think man on the moon is definitive, you definitely have definitive albums on your list, I just think it takes some experienced ears to fully enjoy Danny brown, earl sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, I’d also put Aesop rock in that grouping. (I know you didn’t mention him, but I don’t wanna leave him unmentioned)"
