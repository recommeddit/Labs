"Agreed. Ask your advisor, your department office, the Graduate School, or your university's writing center for recommendations, depending on the format of the thesis (APA, MLA, etc.). It's costly to have it done well, but COMPLETELY worth it."
This!! I work nights and it’s the only thing that could get me to sleep even after melatonin
"Okay, since you're already sure you like drawing, go ahead and spring for some decent tools.

I'm a big fan of Derwent pencils. Faber-Castell is also good stuff. Personally I now have the full gamut from 9h-9b, but I don't use them all for sketching by any means. :)

I would get a white plastic eraser and a kneaded eraser. All the good pencil makers also offer good erasers as far as I know.

For pens, you could get something like some Micron liners, or brush pens, or even just sharpies. Whatever feels good in your hands, really. I'm currently in lust with the Rotring ArtPen.

How much do you use markers? Copics are awesome, but very spendy. You could get something cheaper if you don't know if you like them or how much you'll use them. I got some F-C PITT brush markers and they're quite nice.

> An easy to erase, (non-photo) blue or red pencil for initial sketches

You may be going a bit overboard for a sketch book. Part of the point of sketching is to improve your spontaneity and to finish quick pictures, not to finish planned pieces. I've even seen suggestions that you only sketch in pen so you can't erase.

Personally I don't go that far, but there's no reason you can't just do light construction lines with a hard pencil and either leave them (for rough sketches) or erase them once your ink is down."
"u/Rain_OnWeekends There are a ton of good recommendations in the comments. A couple true crime docs that I didn't see in the comments that are very good and on Netflix; The Confession Tapes, The Confession Killer, The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann, The Staircase, The Ted Bundy Tapes, The Innocent Man, Amanda Knox, Trial by Media, World's Most Wanted (Excellent and just came out on Netflix!), Unabomber In His Own Words, Fear City (about the Mob and just came out on Netflix), Long Shot, Tell Me Who I Am, How To Fix a Drug Scandal, WACO, Wormwood, and another one that just came out on Netflix and was extremely well made is TREAD. 

There are quite a few more I could say but I think I listed enough. These are all on Netflix currently as well! Enjoy!"
Upvotes for K.A.A.N! Fucking love that guy.
Depends on if you quote the sentence in question and put a lenny or add additional details/questions/whatever I think. Also depends on who sees it.
"I doubt that's the real reason seeing as remineralization has long been proven, and Apagard and BioMin are also barred.

But lord knows I will take every opportunity to undermine a corporation's decision to prevent a proven innovation from reaching the population of America."
"Maybe ask for your parents (or whoever is buying the mousepad) to buy the mousepad when it's available (tell them when it's available). Artisan pads are worth it, and imo you shouldn't get anything else. I myself am using an artisan hein fx soft."
"That's not an affront to liberty. That's an affront to decency, which is very different. You happen to have a lower threshold for indecency based on race than some others but still others would consider your position racist. Do you support allowing the KKK to meet, march, or publish? Do you think their right to do so is more important than the right of minorities to live without hated directed towards them? 

We can all agree on what's immoral behavior but disagreeing over what to outlaw doesn't then make some racist."
"I like Temple of Doom. It's honestly about even with Last Crusade for me. But Raiders is still the best, to me."
I'll never buy a laptop lmao pc the best
also known as an hour and a half of cringing...good movie though

"Blindsight was fantastic. Mind blowing shit

Echopraxia didn't do much for me."
"thanks, will give that a try :)"
Why?
"[DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK] 

 So, I had the exact same problem with my charger and port. It just kinda wiggles right? You may have a defective port (I had to replace my P2 once for that) but more likely it's just building up gunk. 

I simply take a long skinny piece of metal (like a steak knife but a tool) and just attempt to clear out the gunk. This has worked very well for me before. HOWEVER, you risk serious damage so be careful."
"""Best"" is very subjective. You should edit your post to add what sort of vibe you want or something about what you hope for out of the place you stay. Some of the best Adults only AI's probably aren't going to be the best for you. 

I've stayed at Secrets, LeBlank, Live Aqua, and Hyatt Zilara in the Hotel Zone myself. All of them are good but there are trips I just want to chill in a relaxed vibe and Hyatt Zilara fits that for me. Personally if I want excitement I go to Hotel Xcaret just south of Playa and stay in their Adults Only because it includes transport and entry to all the X parks. Just came back from there in January. However if you want a party vibe neither of these will be for you and I would suggest Live Aqua."
"Let's just say I agree with Nick Cave as far as the Chili Peppers go.  Flea seems like a cool guy, but the singer's voice drives me nuts.   

Nick Cave on them:  “I’m forever near a stereo saying, ‘What the **** is this garbage?’ And the answer is always the Red Hot Chili Peppers.”"

"I’m not sure what prompted this response, but I like it!"
Without spoiling too much the platinum is extremely easy after your first play through. As in you can get all trophies you missed in a matter of like 15 mins.
"I do that when I need to...often when it's melting, means the caramel is squeezing all over the inside too, leaving caramel strings all over my face. Not the most dignified look. But if I'm eating a Snickers and expecting to look dignified, I need to eat a snack and rethink my priorities."
I would be happy to help maintain it. I use axios in a lot of different projects and love its api.
You should probably pose the question after you watch Homecoming. Tom Holland is the best so far. He actually looks and sounds like a kid who so desperately wants to be a superhero. They really nailed it casting that kid. Not just as Spidey but as a very likable and relatable Peter Parker.
