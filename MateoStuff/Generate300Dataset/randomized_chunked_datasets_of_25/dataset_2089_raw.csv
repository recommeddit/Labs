"Many of them, like smileactives for example, are high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, are they not?  Don't those whiten by a different mechanism?"
"Disease infested Vegas hotel got us in this situation, it may as well get us out"
Old spice.  They say it smells like their uncle...then usually start crying and twitching.  It's all good though.
Who fell over on the ground writhing in pain.
"Nice, just watched Shutter island with my sister last night. Identity and Frailty are a couple of my favorite movies."

"Exactly.  I'm pretty cheap in most cases, too.  We can afford to buy a great bottle of bourbon sometimes, but I just can't bring myself to do it. But I'd still love to get one sometimes."

Filosofem is one of the best albums of all time in my opinion.
"Yes, someone finally recognizes Abhay Deol! I love him, he's so underrated!"
Taylor swift Pandora radio
