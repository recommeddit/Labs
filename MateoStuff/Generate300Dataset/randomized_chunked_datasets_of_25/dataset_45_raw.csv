Why Amol's wife kept working on editing the movie then ?
Open the wrapper like a banana and your hand never needs to touch it.
"I dont know what you mean by bass heaviness associated with JVC, but i really love my JVC HAR 900s with a few minor mods that just reduce the bleeding and sound dampening. Im never getting another pair of headphones."

"Someone just gave this to me for Christmas. I'm in my 30s and was worried it would smell too ""young"" on me. People are surprised when I tell them what it is. It smells really good."
"note, remove shell from eggs before blending."
"My wife picked up three pair of sunglasses from “SEE” last summer, and she loves them. About a third of the price of the Luxotica stuff and seem excellent so far.

I’m still sporting a pair of Spy Optic glasses I picked up on a whim a few years ago.  Best aviators I’ve ever owned, at half the price of my other pairs."
"Oh, I don't remember it as a negative, just distinctive. Similarly, I've heard that Seoul smells like kimchi."
"Ehh, it depends on the games you intend on playing. Paying $200 more for an RTX 2070 is worth it in my eyes, having to consider the diminishing returns in the high end market."

"Boomer moment here, but does anyone remember Mr.C's pizza in the magnolia shopping center? Had an awesome arcade and the pizza was pretty good but that last part might be just rose colored glasses"
"One particular instrument stands out to me that not many take seriously. The Baroque Recorder is an extremely simple instrument, though perhaps not quite as simple as percussion. It has less holes than you have fingers and with no reed, it doesnt require much breath control to play."
"Yeah I’ve been thinking about it. The 711 I’ve heard better things about than the original release of the 710, just worried it might be too small"
"As good a batsman as he was, who do you drop for him?? Though this is why these teams are so hard. Really only no debate selection is Bradman"
"More homework than anyone else.  
At work/internship: ""Hey here is this code project thing, take 3-6 months idgaf I don't know shit about CS""  
At school: ""Recreate Siri but better. Uhhh...due tomorrow I guess"""
"Why is a soft bristled brush better? I've always preferred the firm ones because it feels as though it's doing more.

Are the electric brushes any better for your teeth or do they actually wear the teeth down over time?"
"Cut and Eugene have given great meta answers, so I'll just give my list of 10. These are pretty much the first 10 games I owned, and are mostly gateway-style, easy-playing to help get your buddies into the hobby.

Sorry bro but you gave him an option that literally doesn’t exist in any shape or form. Might as well have told him to wait for RTX 4000 series
Don’t remind me.
"Are you serious? I mean I was kidding but, are you serious?!? Are you team home depot because that's the solution right there. Dump him for being Lowe's."
I have to second this. And best sushi ever.
"Okay, I will also play by the rules.  Here are my top 3 **BOOKS.** While some are components in a larger series - for one reason or another the series falls flat. Examples of that are Rendezvous with Rama (great initial book, forgettable sequels), Enders Game (first book is 100% a different thing than the rest of the series), 

**Children of Time**

**Stranger from a Strange Land**

**Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy**

(Honorable Mentions: World War Z (seriously, people, pick this one up. It's amaze-balls.), Fahrenheit 451,  Player of Games, Flowers for Algernon)"
