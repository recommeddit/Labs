"Not strictly a book about Data Science, but a very important book for a *Data Scientist*, in my opinion :

* [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) (freely and legally available online)

I started reading it during my first internship, where I was working on a remote linux machine, and felt that my lack of knowledge of the system was a bit of a bottleneck. It definitely revealed itself very useful !"

I thought the Foundation trilogy was awful only because the resolution was anti-climatic

"Here's the deal.  When I was a kid, people gave me tons and tons of these little caramelized-peanut-butter-things that were wrapped in black and orange wrappers.  They obviously came from some bulk bin, and I thought they were horrible.  When coming home from a trick-or-treating I would throw all the candy on the floor and separate it into piles: box candies, bars, smarties, and no-name things.  Once that was clear, I would further separate the candies into piles according to type: twizzlers went into one pile, m&ms in another, each type of bar fell into its own pile, and smarties stayed in the smarties pile.  At the end of the night I would always have a pile of those orange- and black-paper-wrapped things.  They'd stay in their own pile, uneaten, until everything else was gone.  I'd reluctantly eat them, thinking they were awful and flavorless -- some were smooshy and some crumbled asI chewed -- until they were gone, and it was at that moment that I realized they were the best tasting candy in the bag.  The moment they were gone, however, was also the point I realized I wanted more of that type of candy than of any other candy and I scoured, sniffed, and licked, like a cocaine addict, every spent wrapper for a crumb of faux-peanut-butter sweet.

I can't find them at my local grocery store, and I crave them every October.

I'd like to send a thanks to all my cheap neighbors -- you made a connoisseur of me for those nameless orange and black candies."

I was in marching band as high schooler and during parades our drum majors communicated stops/turns/songs with coded whistle blasts. One year a float ahead of us was giving out whistles to all of the kids along the route. We couldn’t distinguish our drum majors’ whistles from the hundreds of kids blowing on theirs and basically just fell apart completely. This is a memory I had apparently suppressed until seeing this video haha.

Or take anything worth high value with you as a carry on.
Wouldn't even a halfway decent hotel room be prohibitively expensive? Or do the hotels offer long-term rates they don't advertise?

">I always assumed that the amount of minerals that were in water meant that it’s more healthy.

Again, it depends on the specific minerals. Some are neutral or even bad for you. Generally you get minerals from food too, so it's not like you need high levels of them in your water. You might have an issue if you only ever drank pure water though, I'm not sure what percentage water contributes to your normal mineral allowance, but I assume its pretty minimal."
