33157,best energy drink,"I used to drink them, brand didn't matter to me much, there were so many varieties at 7-11. I would usually just choose the one that looked the newest. Until I tried ""Big Beaver Buzz"", that shit fucked me up beyond belief. Not only did it have every god damn additive that all the other drinks only picked and choosed from, they had the highest concentration of those extra additives. I felt really on edge and shaky for and entire work day, then around 6pmish when I was driving home, I got tunnel vision and had to quickly gather enough focus to pull over. I sat in my car for about 20 minutes, breathing heavily - trying not to pass out. I managed to gather enough energy to start heading home, which luckily I was only 4-5 blocks away from at that point, and once I made it to my bedroom I passed out. 13 hours of sleep later I woke up feeling kinda like I had the flu, no coughing or puking or anything, just fluish. But damn was I tired, like I didn't even sleep but that feeling only lasted maybe half a day or so. Ever since then, I get tunnel vision when I drink more than a couple glasses or coffee or 1 energy drink, doesn't matter which one, they all fuck me up. Lately I've found anything with stimulants in them cause my body to just shut down, like this one time my coworker showed me a fat burner he was taking called ""Ripped Freak"" which I called bullshit on, I told him to just stop eating like shit. He ended up giving me a days dose to try, thinking it would shut me up or something. I figured it would've done nothing and I popped those mother fuckers back (with water, I thought I learned my lesson at this point) but that flu-ish feeling I referred to earlier came back HARD, hit me like a ton of bricks. I went home from work within an hour of that and just had to sleep. I think that god damn Beaver Buzz fucked me up permanently, I have to always watch my caffeine intake, which really is next to nothing right now. The positive thing is at least I had to stop relying on caffeine in the morning and resorted to changing my diet and exercising in the mornings (losing 40 pounds in the process). I'm glad that I now don't need caffeine to get through the day, but keep your kids away from the beaver buzz, that shit will fuck you up."

22547,best celebrity,"Robin Williams stopped by the comic/game store where a friend of mine used to work. Dude bought about $300 worth of Warhammer 40K models (he was trying to build out his Eldar army, he said), and stayed around to chat with the staff before he left for a show he was headlining in town. Took pictures with all the staff before he left. Sounds like a real decent dude."

23521,best car racing video game,"Are you sure that Underground 2 doesn't have level scaling? Because Underground 1 does. I used to have trouble beating the later races. One advice on the internet that worked was to remove every upgrade you can, and the other cars will also be slower, making the game easier.

Also, I bought the Corolla GTS as my starter car in Underground 2. It's the worst car in the game, and the first few races, all my opponents were using the Corolla GTS until I got enough money to buy a bunch of performance parts. 

When I finally upgraded from the Corolla to the Mazda RX-7, which is a pretty big upgrade, everyone I raced with seemed to be using much better cars as well."
