49432,best gaming monitor,"Interesting. I'm in a similar boat as you, but getting PS5 cause of the exclusives and anyone I know is also rolling PC, PS5 or both. I guess its just Xbox presence outside of America"
24041,best anime,"Eureka Seven and dat ending, though. If that had been my first anime I woulda flipped a table."
196,best terminal file manager reddit,"Ye olde reliable `mc` works for me, but there are many others to choose from too."
53945,best medicine for a cold,"Garlic is really amazing. I wish my stomach can handle it. They say you can take one clove in the morning, chew it and it's very strong. I did this for a few days but I felt discomfort in my stomach. Also the taste of garlic lingers in your mouth for a long time."
73498,best battery bank,"If price is an issue, I bought one of these beasts locally for about 15 bucks. I didn’t think it would last, but almost a year later (taking it out nearly every week) it’s still around. At first I thought the cigarette lighter feature was a stupid gimmick. But it could be useful as a fire starting tool I suppose. Being some random China made company, I have my doubts if it’s really 20000mah. I’d love to test it if I knew how.

If price doesn’t matter and you want something rock solid, then I’d prob pass on this."
49118,best gaming monitor,"You could go with the VIOTEK GN27D 27.0"" 2560x1440 144 Hz Monitor.  Bout 200 bucks cheaper same res same refresh rate"
31036,best country to live in,"The country you are from?

I am from the Philippines and planning to FIRE there because
A. My family is there
B. Lower cost of living, so my savings will go a looong way
C. I already got real estates there"
1222,best ice cream flavor,Moscato and Baileys mmmm.
6431,best Netflix documentary,"Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie 

Lots and lots of details, not dramatized, extremely good quality & rare footage, terrific music. A must watch to see the developmental history of US nuclear weapons program, along with some Soviet, British, French nuclear weapons program history."
51850,best iphone case,"Caseless crew! Although I will say my X and XR got hella scratched up. But it’s okay, these are temporary devices anyway that you replace every 3-4 years or even sooner."
64532,Best Nike running shoes,Have you figured out how they produce shoes with such inconsistent quality? I had to stop buying Nikes when I couldn't handle that anymore.

48059,best color to paint with,"Nowhere does ""science"" and ""orange living room"" meet in a peer-reviewed sentence."
68985,best science fiction novel,4th book?
65805,best college in california,Hell yeah Chico Alum!
46999,best hand santizer brand,I mean it actually is pretty accurate. The chances of the rubbing alcohol reaching every single crevice of a surface and reaching every bacterium is pretty slim.  It may kill 100% of the bacteria exposed but it's hard to expose every bacterium to it.
6287,best Netflix documentary,"Icarus. Went in thinking it was just some guy documenting his experience in cycling and whether doping makes a difference, and HUGE twist."
30464,best Mexican war to study,"Not really related to the topic, but just something that I've been thinking about for a while.

Visit a Reddit thread about Iraq or Afghanistan, and you'll see comments along the lines of ""War is horrible, stop it now, bring everyone home"", which is a totally reasonable point of view and something I can agree with.

But then visit this thread and it's filled with things like, ""Oh man, this one war was so bad ass! It's so interesting and cool etc..."" 

Am I the only one who sees a disconnect here? Is war still cool, but only in abstract? Or am I rambling and not making sense.

EDIT: As for the topic, I honestly can't wait to see a true, legitimate historical treatment of the War on Terror in forty years. Once we can get away from the politics of it all and focus on the actual war fighting, I think it'll make some fascinating history."
67325,axios alternatives reddit,I'm sorry I'm still learning (barely finished fullstackopen which uses axios btw). What native solution do you refer to? I don't think I've heard of it. Is it fetch?
