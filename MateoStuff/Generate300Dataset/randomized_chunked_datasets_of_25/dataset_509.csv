73498,"If price is an issue, I bought one of these beasts locally for about 15 bucks. I didn’t think it would last, but almost a year later (taking it out nearly every week) it’s still around. At first I thought the cigarette lighter feature was a stupid gimmick. But it could be useful as a fire starting tool I suppose. Being some random China made company, I have my doubts if it’s really 20000mah. I’d love to test it if I knew how.

30464,"Not really related to the topic, but just something that I've been thinking about for a while.

Visit a Reddit thread about Iraq or Afghanistan, and you'll see comments along the lines of ""War is horrible, stop it now, bring everyone home"", which is a totally reasonable point of view and something I can agree with.

But then visit this thread and it's filled with things like, ""Oh man, this one war was so bad ass! It's so interesting and cool etc..."" 

Am I the only one who sees a disconnect here? Is war still cool, but only in abstract? Or am I rambling and not making sense.

EDIT: As for the topic, I honestly can't wait to see a true, legitimate historical treatment of the War on Terror in forty years. Once we can get away from the politics of it all and focus on the actual war fighting, I think it'll make some fascinating history.",best Mexican war to study
