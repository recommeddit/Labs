"Definitely the war between the two major groups of Incas living in Peru and Ecuador right before and during the arrival of Spanish Conquistador Francisco Pizarro, and the ensuing involvement of the Spanish.  The [Battle of Camajarca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cajamarca) was possibly the most heartbreaking battle I've ever read about, especially as told in the book 1491."
"Strawberry lemonade. 

Just discovered it"
"I think BP is overrated. Awesome character, meh movie."
Unicorn beetle sup case. Clear back with durable squared sides. Good price. I took out the screen protector plastic though. [Unicorn Beetle - ](https://www.supcase.com/collections/smartphone-cases/products/iphone-13-pro-max-6-7-inch-unicorn-beetle-edge-with-screen-protector-clear-case-blue)
We could say the same about endgame though
Omg I *love* using those! Also the blower backpack lawn tool thingamajig looks like the same kind of wild good time.
"> Antibacterial hand sanitizers are marketed to the public as an effective way to ""wash one's hands"" 

Wrong.  They are marketed to kill germs, which they do (except the supergerms that have built resistance!)"
"I second this! I usually google ""insert book/audiobook title"" + vk especially when it's more popular when I'm trying to find stuff I want to read."
Yup and the revenge porn incident forever cemented the fact that heâ€™s just a loser.

I've got some ridiculous looking Hubbard covers in hardback that I never read. I would just grab them at the used bookstore because they would be 25 cents or so.
"Scratch Gears of War 1 from that list, i got that one on pc and it is still one of my favorite games."
"Pretty much the entire line of Elizabeth and James nirvana is incredible. Iâ€™ve gotten 1 oz bottles of grey, bourbon, and black each for under $20"
j cole went double plat with no features
"Drunk McCanughy on bongos?

That's fucking awesome."
"Polish coaches are brainless, the best generation of players absolutely wasted. Hopefully we can make a statement in the next couple of tournaments before Lewa retires."
"South Indian here so obviously, The Hindu. I have a reasonable command of the English language solely because of this newspaper. I grew up reading 'Young World' as a school kid and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I want my president to have a big dick

So nothing for me to clean? 

I figure just keep the seal and mating surface clean, and keep the frost level down."
Or you could just wake up still drunk.
"Buttered Pecan in the winter, Pistachio Almond in the summer."
My SO wonâ€™t binge (ðŸ™„) but Iâ€™m sure we will go through it quickly. Started with the first two episodes of season 1 last night. When is Mikell.... kind feeling like a much more serious and interesting Stranger Things
