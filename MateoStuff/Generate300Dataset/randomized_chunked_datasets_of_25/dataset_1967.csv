Or she would take a couple to wherever she wanted them but then get tired so she would bring the next one to me and make me follow her and take her babies wherever she wanted them so she didn't have to keep going back and forth carrying all the babies. She was so loving and trusting, I miss her so much",best YouTube video
67062,"Absolutely they will.  I was put into a practice harness where I was able to see how hard I could pull the control cords and how to untangle possible chute line crosses.  

They would drill me on how to do certain things and I'd have to respond as quickly as I could.

They taught me a bunch of hand signals where they could easily communicate with me if I needed to extend my legs more or less, alter any part of my body during descent.

Also, I had a radio in my ear where they could tell me what to do should I start doing something dumb.  lol",best places to skydive in california

They're technicians, not researchers.  The fact that everyone here says ""toothpaste doesn't matter"" confirms this in my eyes.  

Xylitol kills bacteria that cause cavities (caries).  There are so many studies that have shown significant decreases in cavities after xylitol administration (gummy bears, gum, etc):

18102,"Kim is SO kind. Ran into her a couple times at a restaurant and have family friends that know her and always defend her. She truly is a great person. She is also TINY IRL. Like 5 feet tall and her body doesn‚Äôt look nearly as disproportionate as it does in photos. She was insanely tan as well! Lol  but yeah, Genuinely a great woman with a huge heart. Loves her fans and understands her life is public and has no problem with that. She knows it took fans to get where she is. Kourt on the other hand... lol 

Kourtney has kids that go to my cousin‚Äôs school. As we saw in this last season, she hates the fame and can get really upset about all the attention. She yelled at one of the parents at a bday party at a pumpkin patch because she thought they were taking pics of her. Maybe they were, maybe they weren‚Äôt... point is she‚Äôs super bothered by the attention she gets and can be quite hostile about it. 

Idk if she understands that Poosh wouldnt exists without KUWTK. She needs to humble herself. There is no such thing as privacy anymore. You capitalized on being ‚Äúyourself‚Äù and your lifestyle.
