What if the spiders were spiders?
I'm all about the herbal teas. I second that!!
"West coast here (PST). Price is back up to $180, unfortunately!"
"Awww man, now I feel bad...."
"Retroactive: the people died or didn't a full *six years* before they were assigned to the control or experimental groups and prayed over.  It's pretty clear that god knew which ones were going to be prayed for, and interceded in just some of their cases."
Cypher. I really did not see it coming at all.
Indeed it is.
"Got crabs? No? Check out King of Crabs, if you’re down with a little crab-on-crab violence. It’s a wonky distraction. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/king-of-crabs/id1354478141"
"Has a similar charm to ""what the fuck, Richard?"""
This is a mighty list. Kudos for including Wasteland 3!
I've heard of this before. I don't understand what the point of blending it does though. Does it taste good? Or like buttery coffee? So many questions
I really want to get Daisy. Smells so good!
I once automated my own job. But I kept my fucking mouth shut and just enjoyed getting paid to Half-Life 2.
">hvac use wouldn't have changed the outcome.

Probably not the order of finish but wouldn't it have affected recharging needs and thus delayed the finish?

Either way we don't have the info on the other drivers' HVAC use so can't compare, unless C&D cares to elaborate.

So my assumption of this event being not as helpful as it could be is correct?"
Maybe we're from Coburg.
I read Only When It’s Us recently and I looooved how sweet and vulnerable it was! Definitely in my top 10!
They both share a very similar earthy-citrus scent. The EDP is just more potent than the EDT.

"I worked at a bar in a restaurant while in college and one night Kevin Hart came in to eat. He wasn't  really that famous at the time. I didn't know who he was, but I was curious as I had to go to the stock room to get a $1000+ bottle of champagne that he ordered in addition to pouring a bunch of really expensive top top shelf shots. His bill ended being well over $2000. The girl who had his table (who also didnt know who he was) said he was by far the most demanding and rude person she had encountered while working there and that he was extremely demeaning.

He ended up leaving a $4 tip, all in crumpled up singles.

Fuck Kevin Hart."
perfect time for mind hunter since s2 will be out tmmrw!
"1. Far Cry 3 (xbox 360)- I was never into FPS until this game. I played some but never got into any campaigns. This one had me hooked instantly. The most fun I've had with any single game.

2. Uncharted 2 Among Thieves (ps3)- Excellent story and smooth controls. Difficulty gradually increases at a nice pace. 

3. Mike Tyson's Punch Out (NES)- One of two video games I've ever played with my dad. Our whole family loves boxing. Not so much a boxing game as it is a strategy one, but still insanely addicting. Presents a huge challenge. This game put hair on my balls at age 6. 

4. Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past (Super NES)- The original was way ahead of its time and this game showed it was no one hit wonder. Updated sound and graphics while returning to the original overhead gameplay enhanced the experience while keeping the charm of the original. 

5. Eternal Darkness (Gamecube)- I'm a fan of horror movies so this game had me intrigued. It had an interesting story and some unique cut scenes. If you haven't checked it out it is worth a look."
"Absolutely. Also why I never volunteer for these sorts of things. Respect for the ones that do it, but it's really only worth it for the ones that are done well."
"Dropped a few times with my Pitaka and no damage. I would not rely on that though. But if you still want it stylish, there is no better option unless you go caseless. Also, make sure you check Pitaka MagEZ, not Pitaka Air. That one is even thinner and really does not seem to help much."
"How?

Edit: Figured it out, if you run two seperate VS Code processes you can drag a tab from one to another. Still not quite as nice as Visual Studio for example but useful!"
Im a man of many talents
