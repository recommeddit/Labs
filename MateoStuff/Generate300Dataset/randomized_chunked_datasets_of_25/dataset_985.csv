22739,"Paul Rudd.   I was at a Decemberists concert, and in between opening acts, I headed to the women's bathrooms.  Paul Rudd was standing outside of the bathroom, obviously waiting for someone.  Do you ever have one of those moments where your mouth just says words without the permission of your brain?  Yeah.  As I passed by Paul Rudd, I did finger guns at him and said, ""Hanging out in front of the women's bathroom?  That's a good way to pick up women."" and kept walking.  I could hear him laughing as I entered the bathroom.  I was torn between being pleased that I made him laugh and being mortified that I was such a dork.  When I left the bathroom, he saw me and started laughing again, so I went over to him and said I had no idea why I said that.  So we had a little laugh together, and had a nice little chat.  He was a really nice guy, not even as a celebrity, just as a cool dude.  

Although thinking back on it, no woman came out of the bathroom and came over to him while he was waiting, so I still don't know why  he was hanging around outside of the bathrooms.  Maybe he WAS picking up women.  &#3232;\_&#3232;",best celebrity

54848,"my understanding of asbestos is that the problem with asbestos is that it is friable and damages the lungs when inhaled.

5703,"Learn Ruby. It is a beautifully designed language that will help you form a concept of programming. A popular web framework using Ruby is Ruby on Rails. It is a joy to use, and easy for beginners because it is very strongly opinionated (e.g. dictates you on where to put stuff). You will pick up HTML and CSS along the way.

An alternative is learning JavaScript and use a full-stack JavaScript framework. I recommend Meteor. I think it will become very popular in the coming decade, just as Rails did. One thing I don't like is that JavaScript is not particularly a pretty language and it can be frustrating to use. I felt so when I was just starting out.",best programming language for web development

67484,"Yea that was my first approach, but as I already know exactly what I'm going to be getting as a response, I figured I'd wrap it in a promise so I could drill down into the response a bit. Again, to help my mental state ha.

example:

instead of calling it like so:

    getAccount(id,id).then((response) => {  
        response.data.RSP.WHATEVERISHERE 
     })

i can just do:

    getAccount(id,id).then((response) => {  
        WHATEVERISHERE 
     })

sometimes it's the small things...

also await would've been another great solution, but I went this route to make the code just a bit cleaner should my co-worker have to dig through it if I end up getting hit by a bus ;)
