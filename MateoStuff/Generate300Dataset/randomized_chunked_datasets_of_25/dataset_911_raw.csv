"I like a light tactile switch personally, could never get on board with linears. I tried holy pandas and some heavier tactiles but after awhile it became fatiguing. I previously used browns, but switched to using naevies and I enjoy them."
"Quick story. Michael Crichton wrote about being in awe of Sean Connery, but one evening at dinner a fan approached Connery and asked for an autograph. He snapped ""I'm eating."" The fan  walked away dejected and Crichton was kinda disappointed in Connery.  But after dinner Connery walked back to the fan and said ""I'm finished my meal if you'd like that autograph now.""  Bottom line: celebs have boundaries that we can't always see, but they're entitled to have them.  Of course, some are just dicks."

"I didn't understand the importance of a great - not just good - fit until I bought a pair of dress shoes that fit me *perfectly*. I mean, literally like a glove. I've been looking for the same level of comfort in a running shoe ever since and I realize now how everything else is secondary, including weight, flexibility or level of cushioning"
"Get Sleeping Dogs. The world has been made really well: I felt as if i was really in Hong Kong. The game also has an excellent story and fun gameplay and so Sleeping Dogs is an extremely immersive game in which you feel that you really are a part of the Hong Kong triads.

I have played all Uncharted games, TLOU, Spiderman, Far Cry, GTA and many others. I found Sleeping Dogs to be better than all of them. Many may disagree that it is the best game, but most will agree it is a great game"
"Cake batter ice cream can be prepared in a variety of ways. Some variations of it have actual cake pieces in it as part of the ice cream, though a lot of the time, it’s vanilla ice cream with vanilla cake flavoring."
Fresh ginger boiled in water with some loose leaf green or black tea and lots of honey and lime is also the perfect medicine for a bad chest (I'm guessing I'm not the only smoker who gets bad chests with colds?). The ginger does wonders for chest. If you've never tried it then give it a go. The stronger the better.

I’d save a few bucks and get the 920. It’s the same camera but without their crappy personify chroma cam thing that doesn’t work. Better off doing a chroma key in obs

"I used to be a console only player and strongly prefer controller since kb/m was alien to me. Few years after getting into pc gaming I just appreciate how fluid and unrestricted my movement are compared to controller.

 So for now all gaming preferred on pc, I just keep a Playstation and a nintendo switch purely for their respective exclusives."
"Sleep, silence, solo. 


Let him sleep. Give him quiet and let him be. Allow him to go solo for a while and not have to do a bunch of shit."
