48288,best color to paint with,"Interior designer working for international firm.

Second that using wall colour to cancel out the poor decisions made in terms of soft furnishings isn't the best solution. 

You'd be much better off if you have lots of reference images of the style you like. And simply copy everything you like about the images, you'll find that since you won't be able to find the exact furnishings in your reference images, you'll start to find things that are close and will portray your own sense of style and taste.

If I had to pick one item that is the easiest to change and has the most impact, i'd pick Art every single time. Whether it's a painting, sculpture or installation. Your choice of art will really change the mood and setting of a space drastically."

5857,best programming language for web development,"I don’t think you should necessarily ease yourself into an easy programming language. Learning a harder one makes it easier to understand others especially since most programming languages derive their syntax from it. For example, C is a pretty difficult programming language but it’s also the basis for many others. You learn C, then you’ll learn others in no time. But of course if you don’t wish to heed my advice, then Python is good for “real” programming for apps and JavaScript is good for websites."
68241,best science fiction novel,"Have always been a fan of anything Clarke, and Asimov's work is wonderful (bigotry aside). Also adore The Long Earth series by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. 

Thought I'd throw out a lesser-known recommendation for something I happened upon by chance and enjoyed enough to own, reread, and pursue the sequel to; Robopocalypse by Daniel H. Wilson. Description in the title really. I liked the interwoven character- and plot-driven story fuelled by decent hard SciFi in a documentary style reminiscent of World War Z without feeling derivative or sacrificing narritive."
55490,best action and adventure novel series,"I'd recommend anything by David Gemmel- Fantastic author- sadly no longer with us.  His books are some of my all time favorites.  I'd recommend starting with 3 waylander books but everything I have read of his is good.  I have yet to read any of his historical fiction however, but I have read most of his other books.

I'd start with the Dreanai Saga, and go from there, Waylander and Skilganon the Damned are my favorite (Druss is great too)."
