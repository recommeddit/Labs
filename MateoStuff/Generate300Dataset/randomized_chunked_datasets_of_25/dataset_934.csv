56611,"Good guide. 

I miss the mention of Acer's XB241YU in the recommendations though. It uses the same panel as the Dell S2417DG but with some additional settings to tune the image and a few extra gimmicks (along with Acer's hideous design). Usually costs around the same.

I'd like to read a bit more about VA and the different kinds of VA and IPS if you're looking to improve your guide. Especially with the relatively cheap Samsung VA schon I feel this tech would deserve a bit more attention.

Anyways, thank you for the time and dedication that went into this. This is a good guide and will be helpful to many I suppose. Keep up the good work!",best desktop monitor

It’s where a ton of golden age Hollywood stars stayed during filming, and it’s full of history, mystique and ghost stories (supposedly one of the Dwarfs from Wizard of Oz died there). The rooms are gorgeous, there’s live jazz in the dining area and don’t even get me started on the food and drinks. Love this place so much we stayed there when we got married!",best hotel to live in

33812,"I'm a fan of Gen 2 and 6... although Gen 6's take on Ruby and Sapphire also bumped it up in my opinion.
I found Johto and Kanto to be packed full of content whereas the move to 3D in X and Y was personally pretty impactful seeing my favourite mons in 3D and getting to feed / play mini games with them. The difficulty could have been ramped up but I had no issues imposing challenges on myself.


Worst gen was Gen 7... don't get me wrong, most of the pokedex is amazing (#TeamRowlet) and the Alolan forms were a genius move. I just found that after the first few Island trials I missed the Gyms. The story was painfully slow. The characters frustrating irritating. And the constant, stop for a cinematic... walk 2 meters.... stop for another cinematic... it's just bad storytelling and gameplay and really made me not enjoy replaying it. US and UM were basically the same... aside from a new Lycanroc, 4 new Ultra Beasts, Mantine Surf (which was pretty cool imo) and the Space Wormhole mini game these two versions were insulting... It's the only  game pair where I didnt by both... one play through was all I needed to put Gen 7 down. Gen 8 barely creeps out of the least favourite category... but I am English so I'm a little biased.",best Pokemon game
