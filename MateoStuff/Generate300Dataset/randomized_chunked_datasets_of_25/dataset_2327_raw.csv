You should add Tennessee to that list.
The mistake was that this is the timeline where parody becomes reality.
"6S plus is by far the best iphone, i changed the battery of my 6S plus last year and it’s performing like a champ"
Said it better than I did/could
I got my LL Bean messenger bag in college and it's still going strong 10 years later
"I stayed at the Riu Santa Fe and we had a fridge stocked with beer and soda and the liquor dispenser thing.  It wasn't at fancy as the palace true, but it was totally fine.  Plus we got good service.  And the deal we got couldn't be beat, 625 for airfare and 5 days 4 nights at the resort.  The only issue I had was a maid broke an expensive bottle of foundation and had to argue a bit that it wasn't already broken and that they should reimburse me, which they did"
"I ended up going for the Dell S2721DGF. It was on sale where I live and I got an additional discount on it, so I got the monitor for €420 delivered. 

I was set on getting the MSI MAG274QRD-QD but the cheapest I could find it was €680 which is too expensive for me currently. Also I looked at a lot of reviews for both monitors and the MSI seems to be the best one but the Dell is also meant to be excellent too and was a good bit cheaper."
Yeah just put it in my first choice.
Broadchurch for sure
"No love for the 30 year war? Great leaders; military innovation; massive carnage, with entire cities depopulated; religious ideology mixed with cynical realpolitik, with sinister French clerics manipulating other players to prolong the carnage and pave the way for France's rise; a settlement which not only changed the balance of power and redrew the borders of Europe, but redefined the meaning of the state. Plenty of wars outside Europe too."

He did shoot one of the most evil people in history though.
"I absolute and utterly agree with thechemistree.  


It is hard to answer if ""water will be safe"" when you know nothing about the water quality going in. Which brings me to a pet peeve of mine, and it is how little most people know about their water and where it comes from."
"Prestige, Memento, Usual Suspects and Orphan spring to mind."
Bruh Verizon sucks ass. They need to get more satellites or towers here.
"I didn't pay the extra $30 for a water line, was just going to ""install"" the fridge myself after they delivered.  Lowes' delivery guys said they had an extra, and insisted on installing it for me.  They did an awesome job and were very careful and clean in my new house!"
"BW2

I absolutely love BW, but BW2 is clearly the last time effort was made into a Pokemon Game"
You can't tame the hivemind. Or use it to sell your junk.
Good thing about 360 is that you can buy 360 game lots on ebay for a cheap price.
I prefer Codenames with 4
"It really is.  Takes a little time to get into, but it's really great.  Keep going my friend."
