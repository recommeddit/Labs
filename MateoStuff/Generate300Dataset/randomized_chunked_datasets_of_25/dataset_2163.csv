Yeah, I'm confused by that one. He and Red Grange are pretty well indelible icons. Did The Athletic forget they existed?"

12458,best gifts for mom,"On Etsy there is someone that hand paints plates with penguins dressed in winter gear along with a persons name under it; I put our family on it as well as my nephew; 
The inspiration was making cookies the year before and not having any plates to put them on, so i figured i would get a xmas themed cookie plate; Apparently now its to sentimental to use."
44380,best items under $100,"1) A decent knife or two.  You don't need a set, but those laser-cut bullshit things you bought at Ikea are what's keeping you thinking you don't know how to cook.  /r/cooking goes roundyround about this but the basix are something with a real edge that can be honed and sharpened (which you can get done at the farmer's market or Joanne Fabrics for like a buck) that you don't feel comfortable putting in the dishwasher.

2) A decent pan.  Boiling water or boiling sauce can be done in any cheap shit thing.  If you're actually grilling or cooking or the like, something with some mass is good.  Lots of people love cast iron; in my opinion, so long as it isn't aluminum and isn't non-stick you're good.

3) A broom, a mop, a carpet sweeper.  If you get in the habit of [tidying every goddamn day](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/daily-cleaning-checklist-00000000000953/index.html) you'll be amazed how clean your place stays with how little effort and that starts with a decent goddamn set of cleaning tools.  Carpet sweepers are really handy for whipping out and zipping over things when you don't need to vacuum everything and they're cheaper than Roombas by rather a lot.

4) A decent wallet.  You've probably been rawking the same one you bought the last time your wallet died, which was likely when the canoe overturned at summer camp.  Go buy a $30-40 wallet that's leather and stuff.  Get one that doesn't hold every fucking piece of ID, club card, coin and photo you've ever owned.  A big boy wallet goes a long way towards a big boy mentality.  Ladies: sorry, frickin' clutches cost a goddamn mint.  

5) A grooming kit.  Bite your nails?  Cut that shit out.  When your nails get too long, *clip them.* get out the cuticle pusher.  Snip those hangnails off with the cuticle scissors.  If nothing else, head to sephora and get the cuticle pusher ($12), the clippers ($8) and a glass file ($9 or so).  A decent manicure is easy, takes very little time and radically alters the way you experience the world.

6) A rice cooker.  Just about the cheapest food in the world and fiddly to make on the stove.  Rice cookers are fire and forget - and if you're brewing up rice, you might as well put the vegetable basket above it and steam some broccoli while you're at it.

7) [Getting Things Done by David Allen](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307581350&sr=8-1) and a cheap-ass label-maker (read the book).  Organization starts from the top down and if you make it through 2/3rds of this book you'll end up with a firm grasp on all the twiddly shit in your life that currently flies out of control.

8) A decent set of tools.  Not a big one - just one with a mild set of sockets, a mild set of wrenches and some decent screwdrivers.  Not the Ikea set.  The Craftsman set is okay although the quality of their tools has plummeted in the past 10 years and they're being sheisty on their ""lifetime warranty.""  If you have a decent set of tools you will find that household projects cease to suck and suddenly become interesting and fun.  It's also empowering - if you have always cowered in fear of assembling a set of shelves a decent set of tools turns you into Tim Taylor.

9) A decent mattress pad.  I'd say ""a decent mattress"" but those cost hella more than $100.  You likely sleep on something shitty and you don't really understand how shitty it is until you sleep somewhere not shitty.  Give ""not shitty"" a try with the help of your local B^3 . 

10) Decent cotton sheets.  Crazy thread count isn't important, but something pastel will breathe better because it hasn't been dyed to death.  Already have decent sheets?  Buy more decent sheets.  Sleeping in clean sheets is something you should do more often than every fourth laundry day.

That's a start.

EDIT:  and

11) [This goddamn spatula.](http://www.amazon.com/LamsonSharp-2-x-4-Turner/dp/B0006GSOTC/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1307581848&sr=8-7)  Holy fuck I love this spatula."
37986,best Marvel movie,It’s so tightly written. I loved every moment
3558,best college for research,Try to talk to students that go to schools and ask them what their average classmate is like and what a weekday and weekend is like for them. This can be tricky to do for a ton of schools but if you try to do it for a few it’s very helpful. At the end of the day it’s about how life is lived on campus and nothing else

41578,best instrument to play,"All instruments are very hard and require thousands of hours of practice to improve but in my personal opinion, the viola is one of the harder instruments. It is abnormally big, and there are not too many concertos for viola.  Of the few I know of, the skill gap between them in very large. So in short, an instrument with more music may be easier to progress with than one without too many options"

53908,best medicine for a cold,"I saw a graph somewhere that the ozone layer over Sweden isn't too great either. The official stance is to use sunscreen, but I never stay out in the sun for long enough to burn so I don't feel like I need it most days. 

The vitamin d deficiency up here definitely is bad though since we only get like 4-5 months each year where we can make it at all. I choose to go for the d instead of protection from burns since I don't stay out thar long anyway."

Sileo = Said to be the new Cydia.

58167,best cologne,"This is my mainstay scent. I know it's super popular, but its subtlety makes it easy to wear regularly. That, and the closer people get to you, the better it gets.

I've tried other colognes, and many are good, but Sauvage has easily gotten me the most notice and compliments."
64973,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Go to Chase and ask for Warren the owner. The food is incredible!
9978,best portable charger,"I also own a Limefuel battery pack and charger. It's a wonderful device; it will charge Apple and Android devices at 2.4 amps. It supports pass-through charging which is handy if you have one foreign power adapter and want to charge your pack and all devices overnight. It charges from a standard micro-USB cable.

The limefuel charger is also quite good; it can charge 2 devices simultaneously at 2.4 amps each and works wonderfully with both android and apple devices."
