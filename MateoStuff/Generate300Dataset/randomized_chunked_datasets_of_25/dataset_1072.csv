Open door is sex on the page, described to some level of explicit-ness. 

Close door is when sex happens off the page in some capacity. Could be fade to black, or mentioned as a fact that happens but we get no description of the act.

Edit: Happy cake day!"

67981,best science fiction novel,"Ctrl + F ""Gene Wolfe"" and I see nothing!

His ""Book of the New Sun"" tetralogy is absolutely essential IMO. It's dense and really bizarre, but so fascinating. Give it a shot if you are tired of seeing the same old books on every sci-fi list (Dune, Heinlein, etc).
