"The ""Edit"" had me laughing. Seriously though - make that your theme music for the week. Report back with how much your quality of life has improved."

[This article is the classic polemic against PHP](http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/).
"It's a good comic, and true too, there was some bitterness between Christopher Robin and AA Milne.  When Christopher was in school, he was teased mercilessly by the other kids, they kept asking him if he was saying his prayers.  

There is a bio of CR Milne around somewhere, I read it several years ago.  

Edit - I really dislike the Disney Pooh, I have ever since someone gave one of those books to my son as a gift, it was a story where Rabbit doesn't like Tigger and he talks the others into abandoning him in the woods.  That would have never have happened in the AA Milne books.  Just thought it was a shitty version of Pooh."
You might want to check the paper book versus Kindle book prices for the paper books you happen to buy as the friends I know who have one have been bitterly disappointed at how the paper books are generally cheaper.

"LinkedIn is great to have. I regularly check that when I see it on an application. I also am likely to check your Github if you link it. Other than that, I rarely look up people's social profiles. That being said, if you have some really unseemly things on your social media profiles, it's a good idea to remove that."
Dasani is so gross.
"just because an album is influential doesn't mean it's objectively better. opinions on music are subjective. your opinion is worth the same as anyone else's, and there's no right or wrong opinions about music."
"Raw ginger grated , honey and hot water. Try to rest as much as possible . To be honest though if you can do it cut some raw ginger into thin slices and just eat it .. Munch it up and swallow it's tough at first but you get used to it . Google raw ginger for its benefits .. If the cold has already taken you will have to ride this one out but in future if you feel one coming in get the ginger down . I have kept many a cold away by doing this while lift sharing with people who have stinking colds .."

"This is awful advice. PHP is in high demand. Some seasoned programmers might dislike it but it's much easier to find a PHP job instead of any other trending language/framework. I am not saying to focus on PHP but it's pretty important to know, most websites have PHP for their server side language and that's a fact. Not to mention that there are a lot of businesses that will pay top dollar for custom Wordpress/Drupal site. But that's my experience, I am not in Silicon Valley, most jobs around my area are for PHP developers."

"Val had dropped off the stage. Similar to Trevolta and pulp fiction. I think Heat gave Val a shot at lead that he was not getting before.  And his performance boosted that. He plays Elvis in True Romance but if you’re not paying attention, you don’t even realize it’s him."

Engineer here. Couldn't be more satisfied with my job. Well I guess I could if they replaced my computer chair with a bean bag chair... Yeah that would make it even better.
