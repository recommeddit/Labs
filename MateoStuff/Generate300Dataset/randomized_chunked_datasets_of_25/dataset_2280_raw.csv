"Another great documentary. To watch them break down the entire Cambridge Analytica scandal was fascinating to say the least. 

Karim Amer did a great job of not only shining a light on them, but also on the new threat of information mining in general. But I have to say Britany Kaiser was getting on my nerves the entire time lmao."
I love all of your recommendations Eros! Since we tend to agree on books I am for sure checking out L.M Montgomery! Also the Flatshare is currently in my TBR. I might have to get to that one quick because it is so frequently mentioned as awesome. Thank you!!!!

"Do you have a slow cooker or a rice maker? I make steel-cut oats in my rice cooker, and portion out servings with peanut butter and/or fruit into jars to take with me on the go. I don't mind eating it cold, but it's also really good to microwave and then add a bit of  (almond) milk and brown sugar. 

My partner and I pre-make a ton of breakfast burritos to put in the freezer. Tortillas, cooked rice or roasted potatoes, black beans, spinach or arugula, scrambled eggs, salsa/hot sauce, sour cream. We make a little assembly line and put together a couple dozen. We wrap individually in plastic wrap, then store 6 each into freezer ziplock bags. If we need a quick and hearty breakfast on the go, we'll just throw one into the microwave while we're getting ready in the morning and grab it on our way out the door. These are so good, were both guilty of eating them while we're at home and not in a rush :)

Edit: oh man, I just saw that you don't like oatmeal. In that case, I'd just say anything that you can freeze is your friend. Whenever I make waffles, ill lake a double batch and freeze the extras. Pop them in the toaster, spread with nut butter and bananas, and there's another quick and easy breakfast. 

Our next experiment is to make breakfast sandwiches (English muffins, eggs, deli meat, cheese) and freeze. I've done it before and didn't love how it warmed up in the microwave, but it might be good after reheating in the oven or toaster oven."
"I asked for a new wedding band (not a super expensive to one) and some pink Sapphire earing since Sapphire is my daughter's birth stone, etsy has some great things, I would love a maid and to not worry about cooking too"

"You probably will be waiting on the Lightning as there are already tons of preorders and Ford will be constrained by chip and battery supplies like every one else unfortunately.  The lightning does look awesome though, EV Explorer/Expedition would be better!"

Mind if I ask you how durable the glass on Ray Bans are? I just purchased a couple and was hoping to use them during the winter in Minnesota to protect my eyes from the wind.
Freebirds Burritos in IV is delicious for quick and non fancy foods. The farmers market downtown is amazing as well.
