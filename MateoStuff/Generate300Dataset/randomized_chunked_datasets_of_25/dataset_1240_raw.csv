"Scotch neat or red wine.  You can't easily drink a lot of either, and that way you aren't flooding your system with sugar or a massive volume of liquid with beer."
Just pull out a couple grand from your savings account. Go down to the nearest body of water.  Light all your money on fire and then throw it into the water.  That's what being a boat owner is like
"The brio is the best webcam you can buy right now but it's not cheap and you need good lighting. The webcam on its own looks ""terrible"" but stick two elgato light and your getting fantastic video quality better than 90% of streamers on twitch. But 2 lights are £240 and the webcam is basically £200. If I was short I cash 100% would be buying good lighting not cheap Amazon crap first. With good lighting you can even make a c920 look very good"

"In my opinion, one of the greatest indications of that teams greatness is the impact it left on world football afterwards. 

FIFA changed the offside rule partially because of how that Milan defense mastered/abused it. 

Guardiola's pressing game was indirectly derived from Sacchi, even Jurgen Klopp gave Sacchi credit for his gegenpressing.

Look at the top level football managers and executives that were involved in the club directly during or after his influence: Capello, Rijkaard, Ancelotti, Boban, Savicevic, Gullit, etc... Everywhere you look in football today you can see Sacchi's disciples."

"ya it's super legit...there might be hubs that are good for new movies/tv/music but I don't know of them...that being said, even in audiobook/comic hubs, the people there are pirates and have like 30 terabyte shares, so they usually have the newest movies/tv/music anyway.

But for audiobooks and comics dc++ is where it's at."

"Silk pillowcase.

EDIT: I got a silk pillowcase because I have really really long hair (down to my butt) and it keeps it from tangling as badly overnight."
"Thanks 440_hz. I think your right. I am not sold on the idea. That's why I am here asking for opinions. I am not completely against doing anything. As most people here have already said, if that's the case I should just get a cat! But we both work 8 hours a day so will make it hard to be there all the time, hence my ""wishlist"" however It seems I might be asking too much. Of course I would take it for walks and stuff, just not very active, especially during winter. I am in a gym and will not go out in the cold.. Summers would be fine. My 3 y/o would keep it running around the house i'm sure.. but again just was hoping I could find a breed that is an easier option that some of the others...."
"And you have to add Philip Dick's books.  There's a reason so many are turned into movies, though the books are so much better than the movies like Minority Report, Adjustment Bureau, Paycheck, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Blade Runner), ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" (Total Recall), and others...

In the past few years, however, most of the classifications have been renamed. For example, R1 is now ""RU/VH: Research Universities (very high research activity)"".
