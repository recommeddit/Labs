23680,best car racing video game,"Nfs Heat received a lot of bad reviews, people say that the police at night is very hard.
Nfs payback was quite bad.
Project Cars 1 is good."
67947,best science fiction novel,"I could hardly challenge them to a game of Azad though. (Even though I really, really want to play that)
I think that Banks politics (traditional leftwing) work better in Europe than the US in general."

63064,Best online React course,If you want to work in a company that is not a startup. you need Redux. and tbh Redux is awesome.
60727,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I think all of them except Jesslenik have one or two other specials also on Netflix and they all seem to be pretty consistent too. 

John Mulany for example did New in Town which is probably his best, but it was shot for Comedy Central not Netflix, it might still be on Netflix, and if it is I would start with that one. Comeback Kid is his second, and it is really close in terms of how good it is. Kid Gorgeous at Radio City is his newest Netflix special and it's definitely still contender for the best on Netflix, just not as good as the other two. 

I just only wanted to list one of each comedian and say what I thought was their best Netflix special."
51697,best iphone case,Apple black leather for my 11 Pro. Been rocking black leather since the 5s
32219,best hotel to live in,"I’ve always wanted to know: how does a celebrity’s alias for a booking get advised to the hotel?  Does their assistant or whoever makes the reservation say that the booking is for JeffMegaStar (or whatever the celeb’s name is), but they will be travelling under “Phil McCracken” or whatever?

And how does the person doing the check-in know that the person standing in front of them (who they may or may not recognise) is going to be under “McCracken”?"
57532,best cologne,"1.  Creed Millesime Imperial 
2.  YSL La Nuit de L'Homme
3.  Guerlain L'Homme
4.  Chanel Platinum Egoiste 
5.  Bleu de Chanel

Honorable mention: Dior Homme Sport (which I hate, but women love it)

Note, I own and wear a ton of Niche, but my list of most complimented is mainly designer.  Also Aventus is not listed nor Baccarat Rouge and I wear both often.  Designer fragrances brings the most compliments over Niche in my opinion."

19783,best workout music,While I do thoroughly enjoy Nier Automata and it's soundtrack; would you really consider that to be hard-hitting hip hop?
17995,best Kardashian,"She gets so much hate, but honestly if I was in their family I believe I would be the most like Kourtney."
5170,best home improvement store,"Yea, they are pretty interchangeable... my wife likes Lowe’s finished products better (like light fixtures, mirrors, faucets ect.). 

Both kinda expensive, both kinda poor quality."
73168,best Linux distro,"If you're gonna ditch Mint, you might as well look at Kubuntu too.  I'm currently running Mint KDE(I've also tried and liked mint cinnamon) but I just got an SSD and I'm probably going to install Kubuntu on it.

Mint isn't terrible or unstable or unusable by any means, and they do some really cool stuff, but it is starting to seem like about time to move back to Ubuntu. It happens a lot with forks, someone makes a fork to solve a problem, the original distro also solves it, and then everyone goes back.

I suspect it's gonna happen with B4Artists, with everyone going back to Blender."
