60727,"I think all of them except Jesslenik have one or two other specials also on Netflix and they all seem to be pretty consistent too. 

John Mulany for example did New in Town which is probably his best, but it was shot for Comedy Central not Netflix, it might still be on Netflix, and if it is I would start with that one. Comeback Kid is his second, and it is really close in terms of how good it is. Kid Gorgeous at Radio City is his newest Netflix special and it's definitely still contender for the best on Netflix, just not as good as the other two. 

I just only wanted to list one of each comedian and say what I thought was their best Netflix special.",Best comedy show on Netflix

And how does the person doing the check-in know that the person standing in front of them (who they may or may not recognise) is going to be under “McCracken”?",best hotel to live in

73168,"If you're gonna ditch Mint, you might as well look at Kubuntu too.  I'm currently running Mint KDE(I've also tried and liked mint cinnamon) but I just got an SSD and I'm probably going to install Kubuntu on it.

Mint isn't terrible or unstable or unusable by any means, and they do some really cool stuff, but it is starting to seem like about time to move back to Ubuntu. It happens a lot with forks, someone makes a fork to solve a problem, the original distro also solves it, and then everyone goes back.

I suspect it's gonna happen with B4Artists, with everyone going back to Blender.",best Linux distro
