7717,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I'd say that the price on it is okay, but not great. I think that virtually all budget laptops have the chance to randomly fail. That said, if you treat the laptop well, you will likely be fine, but it is important to keep in mind that budget laptops can be unpredictable."
70018,best major to study in college,"> probably lifts AC or Furnace units incorrectly

Safe lifting has been around just long enough for some of us to to see it really does work firsthand. Back when I was younger, it was just starting to hit workplaces, and I can see in my age group that it really works among those of us who actually practice it."
22407,best celebrity,"Met Peter Cullen (voice of Optimus Prime and Eeyore) at Botcon in 2012. They had a raffle system set up for autographs/meet and greets. He saw a bunch of us standing off to the side, including a man next to me who was sobbing because Peter meant so much to him. Peter full on RAN from the line he was supposed to be autographing and bear hugged this guy for at least a solid minute, patting his back and saying “It’s all right. Everything is okay. I’m here now,” while the guy sobbed on him. Then Peter autographed all our memorabilia and was whisked away by some very angry con staff.

Wonderful, wonderful man. Class act and genuinely kind."

30101,best Mexican war to study,"We mostly focus on the issue of not annexing Texas sooner because they were in the south and would’ve been a “slave state” upsetting the balance of power in the country at the time. They highlight the movement of troops closer to the border to lure Mexico into firing the first shot, but also focus on the repeated requests by Texas to join the Union being a major factor in finally taking action. We also focus on the refusal of Mexico to enter peace negotiations due to the political attitudes of certain members of the government. But overall it’s shown as the match that sparked the American civil war. It’s not focused on as heavily as other conflicts like the French and Indian war, the revolution, or the civil war."

67373,axios alternatives reddit,"Lol, nice.  Why don't you re-read my comment and try again.  The key part is that, understanding where an abstraction comes from and how it works helps you better understand how to implement and use that abstraction more effectively.  I don't think I'm superior because I want to understand how things work under the hood.
