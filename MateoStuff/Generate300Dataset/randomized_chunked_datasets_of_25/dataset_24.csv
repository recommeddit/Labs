You should also be somewhat vary of apps that require an installer and that asks for your **password**. This is a common tactic used by malware to get access to OS ""plugin"" (filesystem) locations and system settings. **Most** legitimate apps have no need for this."
70065,best major to study in college,Always.
51047,best rap album,"I always feel these lists would be better if they were in ""no particular order"", as in these are what we consider the 500 best albums. When they rank the top 500 it gets silly, I find it hard believe anyone on earth thinks Amy Winehouse's Back to Black is a more worthy album  than Abbey Road or Suedes's  Dog Man Star is better than Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks."
42828,best detective show,Ouroboros!
68302,best science fiction novel,I much preferred A Deepness in the Sky to A fire Upon the Deep. Maybe because I read it first? >!I was super-invested in Pham after having read **Deepness** and how his story played out in **A Fire Upon the Deep** really bummed me out.!<
11605,best gifts for dad,Guys... should we tell 'em?
56256,best action and adventure movie,"I love DMC. But as a movie Curse is almost perfect. I would put it slightly below Raiders. Behind all the fun, the script is an excellent one."
41261,best instrument to play,"I love the sounds of a telecasters neck pickup. Just the right amount of fat-ness but still has a sharp, bell-like clarity."
66839,best soccer team in the world,"Ricardo Pereira is injured, and Nelson Semedo is much better than people give him credit for"
3351,best webcamera,"Disagree. If you’re just testing the waters, don’t bother with a camera. If you decide you like streaming, don’t waste money on a 270 and get a 920/922 later. Just get the 920/922 first and be done with it. It’s still a budget camera, it’s not expensive at all and it can be found on sale often. The quality is also a LOT better than the 270. Not talking about pixels, but colors and the way it handles light are all much better. Besides you can use a webcam for more than just streaming."
45541,best gaming system,Seeing stuff like this gives me hope for humanity.
33806,best Pokemon game,"Hg/SS are my favorite, has my favorite starter and Pokemon typhlosion. I like the cultural look they gave the buildings and I like how team rocket is trying to rebuild, and the Kanto post game has got to be the best postgame ever

Gen3 is my least favorite and honestly all the water and surfing was too much, it has the least amount of favorable Pokemon out of all the gens, ""I want more water!"" "" I want more land"" idea for the evil team is kind of stupid, I don't like 51/2  out of 8 of the legendaries

I don't count the lets go games otherwise they would be least favorite because I don't like the game play"

8508,best toothpaste,"Dental assistant here.... TOO MANY BOXES OF TOOTH PASTE, TOOTHBRUSHES AND MOUTHWASH. every week, its ridiculous."
4771,best home improvement store,"I always go with lowes. HQ is in my home state, and lowes fired my mother-in-law. I also only shop at Harris teeter, academy, harbor freight, staples because they fired her as well"
54061,best medicine for a cold,"I tend to do this because I don't like sitting around. Ultimately, at the end of the day, it makes me feel a lot worse."
57108,best water brand,"Reverse osmosis. It's a 5-stage filter system with a reverse-osmosis membrane in there to get just about anything that isn't pure H2O out of the mix. 

The whole system is about 200 bucks to install. The carbon block and poly filters are cheap, they cost 30 bucks or so every 6 months. The membrane costs 70 bucks and lasts about 3 years for a normal family using it just for drinking water, so long as you remember to replace the carbon and poly filters regularly."
50478,best rap album,Also What's The Difference.  Hottest brass I've ever heard.
17367,best iOS game,Still the best franchise on IOS after all this time
