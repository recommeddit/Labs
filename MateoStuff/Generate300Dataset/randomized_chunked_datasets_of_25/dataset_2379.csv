33608,best electric car,My only complaint with the Volt is it uses gas in winter. Any weather below freezing is engine running due to temperature. And around here that's about 5 months of the year.

25902,best cricket teams of all time,They were basically the only countries playing for half of that period anyways.
33865,best Pokemon game,"Emerald is still better than Omega and Alpha. If you have no objection to emulating games, you could download a GBA emulator and a base ROM of Sigma Emerald (downloading the base ROM, or pre-patched version, is easier than patching it yourself IMO). Sigma Emerald has many quality of life features (phys/spec split, auto-renew Repels, etc.) from the newer generations, as well as Mega Evolution, Fairy-types, etc. while still retaining the base gameplay and charm of the original Emerald. I'm not allowed to link you a base ROM of Sigma Emerald *on this sub*."

2897,best headphones,"Ohms are a unit of electrical resistance; the higher the resistance, the more voltage is required to push a given amount of current through a headphone. What (if any) headphone amp do you have? If you don't have one don't get the 250 ohms."
12346,best gifts for mom,"I spoke with her boss to secretly get her a day off work so we could go shopping and have dinner. As a guy I grew up sulking about being dragged around shopping as a kid so I can see she really appreciates me putting in some enthusiasm for it with her. Also, as I get older, I realise experiences and moments with people are much more valuable than things."

72792,best wireless lightweight mouse,Logitech G203/G102!
40941,best instrument to play,"I'm not sure I agree. I'd generally rather listen to a saxophonist who's been playing for a year than a flutist is a clarinetist who's been playing for the same amount of time. Flutes and clarinets sound so airy and unfocussed until they reach quite a high level. Saxophones sound clear, strong and steady, even with minimal experience."

60431,Best comedy show on Netflix,I second this. Everything about it is fantastic and hilarious. One liners galore.
59865,best perfume,"Calvin Klein Truth for men- 
> fresh, squeaky, green, professional, like cut grass, a whisper of sweetness. Pretty unisex in my opinion and great for work especially since it doesn't project wildly but stays close to the skin.

Crabtree and Evelyn Summer Hill- 
> white field flowers!! Sunshine and linen!! Peach!! Wildflowers! Bright and joyful without being screechy. Smells like a childhood lotion to me for some reason, smells like safety and home and mothers. A more feminine choice"
