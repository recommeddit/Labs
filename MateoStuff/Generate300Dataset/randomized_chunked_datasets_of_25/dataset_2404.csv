29808,best money managing app,"I use mint a for high level tracking and then I went a step further.  I have a Google sheet that breaks down in 2 week increments ( based on the couple times a month major expenses hit, like student loans and mortgage, and when paychecks come in). 

I then have different cells set up as sums of expenses/deposits (I add lines entries as needed, like if I took out cash that week, or had a non regular expense paid in cash).  Credit card payments just take a single cell since I pay them in full.

28970,best breakfast foods,"SoCal style eggs benedict. Instead of Canadian bacon use a crab cake (lightly fried is the key) and add avocado, I've seen it with tomato added as well but I can do without. Pile on the hollandaise with your poached egg and your good to go. Seriously so damn good."

Aren't these pseudoscience BS? Amway used to sell stuff like that in the 90s, I'm assuming it's similar? [https://gizmodo.com/this-kickstarter-is-clearly-just-a-marketing-scam-from-1689640209](https://gizmodo.com/this-kickstarter-is-clearly-just-a-marketing-scam-from-1689640209)"
