33477,"You can get a decently optioned Jaguar I-pace for less than 60k after dealership discount and tax rebate.

A Model 3 *Performance* costs less than $60k, and so do the rest of the Model 3 line ups.

I think there are more EVs for less than 60k than there are ones that’s more expensive, in the States that is at least.

Edit: lol getting downvoted for listing straight up facts. The anti-EV crowd around here are experts at moving goalposts. It’s ok to just say you don’t like something for whatever personal reasons, I get it, especially as an enthusiast who went out of my way to get an ICE weekend car. But there is no need to make up excuses and then move goalposts over and over again.",best electric car

67439,"> Also pretty sure you can cancel and do progress bars (article says as much).

I remember reading about an issue with implementing progress bars, I think it was with fetch and file uploads, the article that pointed it out then suggested using axios which didn't have that issue.

Cancellation seems to have been an issue with fetch at least [in the past year](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16655112), perhaps that has changed since, but you can imagine that people who ran into the issue back then and used an alternative like axios as a solution probably don't bother checking up if their opinion ""A is better than B because of X problem"" has changed, they just stick to what works unless given good reason to. That's the case with lots of libs/api/frameworks/etc, probably even languages.

fetch is also not supported on the backend with node and perhaps other uses of JS where I think axios is?(there is also node-fetch for node users). There is a rather long issue about it on nodes github about adding fetch and it doesn't seem like it'll happen. Sooo... in this case it can just be use axios frontend or backend, remember how to use just that and not bother about switching between the two.",axios alternatives reddit

I think I would look better in a square frame sunglasses but the last time I had a pair they were too narrow and the next model up was too wide.

Did look into using it a while ago, but am not a fan of SAAS apps. I don't deny that people have used and enjoy YNAB, and are happy to pay. I'm just old school myself and don't like that business model personally.  But its disingenuous to say it is a free app, IMO.",best money managing app

But FYI, the reason why some are TSA Approved is because TSA has I think a dozen or so different key types, so technically TSA has a key to open it. However, a few years ago, a reporter talking about this new security measure was shown the keys, took a photo, and this photo was published. Then people reversed engineered and 3d printed the keys. So....not as secure as you'd think. So again mostly just to deter quick thieves.",best suitcase lock
