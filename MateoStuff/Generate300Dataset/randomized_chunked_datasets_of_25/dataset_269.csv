50708,best rap album,That Kota album was really nice and I somehow had forgotten how much I liked it. He always manages to make me smile on some Devin Tha Dude type shit
56397,best desktop monitor,I've got a G7 but I really wish there was a non curved option
11150,best backpack for college,"I concur. I've had this backpack since I think 2005. I've had it so long I can't remember when I bought it. It has held up through the last few years of undergrad and law school, as well as being my go to overnight bag. It still looks almost brand new."
33477,best electric car,"You can get a decently optioned Jaguar I-pace for less than 60k after dealership discount and tax rebate.

A Model 3 *Performance* costs less than $60k, and so do the rest of the Model 3 line ups.

I think there are more EVs for less than 60k than there are ones that’s more expensive, in the States that is at least.

Edit: lol getting downvoted for listing straight up facts. The anti-EV crowd around here are experts at moving goalposts. It’s ok to just say you don’t like something for whatever personal reasons, I get it, especially as an enthusiast who went out of my way to get an ICE weekend car. But there is no need to make up excuses and then move goalposts over and over again."
16205,best sunglasses for fashion,"I love my William Painter “The Hook”.

Titanium frame. Guaranteed for life. And they have a beer opener built into the design. I stepped on my pair and broke them, they sent a new one within a week.

Cost under $150."
67439,axios alternatives reddit,"> Also pretty sure you can cancel and do progress bars (article says as much).

I remember reading about an issue with implementing progress bars, I think it was with fetch and file uploads, the article that pointed it out then suggested using axios which didn't have that issue.

Cancellation seems to have been an issue with fetch at least [in the past year](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16655112), perhaps that has changed since, but you can imagine that people who ran into the issue back then and used an alternative like axios as a solution probably don't bother checking up if their opinion ""A is better than B because of X problem"" has changed, they just stick to what works unless given good reason to. That's the case with lots of libs/api/frameworks/etc, probably even languages.

fetch is also not supported on the backend with node and perhaps other uses of JS where I think axios is?(there is also node-fetch for node users). There is a rather long issue about it on nodes github about adding fetch and it doesn't seem like it'll happen. Sooo... in this case it can just be use axios frontend or backend, remember how to use just that and not bother about switching between the two."
16015,best sunglasses for fashion,"MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY

I think I would look better in a square frame sunglasses but the last time I had a pair they were too narrow and the next model up was too wide. Twin Falls is pretty much perfect on me because I can actually wear them all day even if I look like a dorky volleyball player."
33178,best energy drink,The butt crack of dawn- the worst part of dawn.
56138,best action and adventure movie,Drive angry
29956,best money managing app,"I thought YNAB is a subscription app?

Did look into using it a while ago, but am not a fan of SAAS apps. I don't deny that people have used and enjoy YNAB, and are happy to pay. I'm just old school myself and don't like that business model personally.  But its disingenuous to say it is a free app, IMO."
65770,best college in california,"California is the paradise it is because of its liberalism, that’s the true irony.  The weather is obviously aside from that, but a majority of the things people love about California are because taxpayers have been paying to keep them that way or make them better."
60118,best freezer brand,"Thanks for the recommendation! It seems like a lot of people have qualms with the chest style, I'll consider the stand-up"
26917,best board games,"I think Pandemic, Pandemic legacy, Season 1, season 2 and season 0 will be there too"
10706,best suitcase lock,"Don't get a cheap crappy one. TSA should only throw away or break ones that aren't TSA Approved. But FYI, the reason why some are TSA Approved is because TSA has I think a dozen or so different key types, so technically TSA has a key to open it. However, a few years ago, a reporter talking about this new security measure was shown the keys, took a photo, and this photo was published. Then people reversed engineered and 3d printed the keys. So....not as secure as you'd think. So again mostly just to deter quick thieves."
55023,best places to hike in the east coast,"White Mountains of New Hampshire. Just don't mess around with weather, it gets real serious real quick up there.

Adirondacks in NY are also great, but clearly second best for me. The further south you go the less familiar I am."
35048,best NFL player,"That's a pretty good list. There are only 10 spots but there are others that could fit in. Deion Sanders, Dan Marino, Dick Butkus, John Madden (the game is named after him for for God sake) mean Joe Greene just mentioning a few."

17024,best iOS game,It’s definitely a rougelike in the modern sense of the word. Some argue all these games should be called rougelites as they aren’t turn based etc etc
