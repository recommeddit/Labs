15837,best sunglasses for fashion,The PC Police are down-voting you but your not wrong and that is helpful. Oakley even has an entire line of Asian fit glasses because SURPRISE all races aren't shaped the same. Pretending that Asian people aren't generally shaped different doesn't help anyone get proper fitting glasses.

72992,best Linux distro,"You could just install Arch on btrfs though. I'm not saying that TW is a bad choice, but it seemed less stable than Arch to me, which is obviously entirely anecdotal. Also, the OBS is not nearly as useful as the AUR."

18970,best YouTube video,What happened to him? Haven't seen him upload in probably a year
72570,best keyboard switches,"My favorite are the Cherry MX Reds. Better for gaming than for typing. Quiet and smooth. They encourage bottoming out because there is no activation feedback. This makes them a little awkward if you do a lot of typing, though. Typists generally prefer blues or browns. There are many more switches which mostly vary in travel distance and pressure required to press them."

69704,best major to study in college,"I'm starting to think that most degrees are like this now.  It's like a bachelor's is the new HS diploma. So many people have bachelor's degrees these days, that they're not worth what they used to be."
