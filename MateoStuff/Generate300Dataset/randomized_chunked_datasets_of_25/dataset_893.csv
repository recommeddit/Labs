69209,best major to study in college,"It depends what job you want.

When people double major it's often because they can't decide between two things and don't want to close doors down the line but a double major won't always help you unless you know specifically what you want."

44428,best items under $100,"I fucking love imagining ridiculous ways to make this work IRL. I'm thinking either:

 * A turbine engine that sucks in and dehumidifies air at incredible rates. Just don't point it the wrong way or you might get turned into aerosolized human hamburger purée.  
 * A network of water jets in your shower that computer-guided aim at the shower head, the shower head is just a gimbal and limiter that redirects the stream where you want it. Lidar or CV to avoid the streams from hitting you except thru the shower head, multiple stream sources available for seamless automated switching."

65355,best phone service company,"Unfortunately no one can answer that question except for you. There are way to many variables involved for anyone to give you a good answer.  
When evaluating coverage don’t take anyone word for it test it out yourself. Especially in dense cities. Speeds can vary greatly from block to block and even what side of a building you are on can make a big difference. At my office building I can get 3.5 Gbps on mmWave in exterior wall rooms with windows that face a mmWave tower, on nationwide 5G I’m usually around 100 Mbps, on LTE I’m usually around 130 or higher. Now a block away there is one area that I’m lucky to hit 1 Mbps on LTE and nationwide 5G I’m getting 5Mbps or so.

To determine what carrier is the best for you,  you have to take a few things in consideration. 

1. How do you use your phone? Do you just talk and text on it,  or do basic web browsing and video streaming, or are you a heavy data/hotspot user. 

2. Can you test out other carriers in multiple areas for speed, keeping in mind with how you use your phone. If you just talk and text then as long as you have signal bars on your phone you should be fine with any carrier (also I would add that if you only talk and text consider a MVNO as they are much cheaper). If you just do basic browsing and streaming then I would probably make sure you have at least 5-10 Mbps or so speed in the places you test. If you are a heavy data user shoot for a higher number than that. Also don’t forget to look at upload speeds as well not just downloads.  Don’t just test at home, test areas where you work, travel through, and hang out in as well. 

3. Lastly look at plan costs. See which carrier has the best plans that meets your needs. 

4. If you can get a prepaid sim and try the service for yourself. Just be mindful of you are switching carriers to save money (let’s say one carrier is 5 bucks a month cheaper, over a year that 60 bucks. But you paid 50 bucks or so for the prepaid sim and a month of service for testing so you really might not save much in the long run). 

Also don’t be afraid to try a carrier that you may have had bad experience with in the past. Coverage is always changing and expanding on all carriers. Also it is possible that coverage can get worse in areas. I know in my area one spot coverage got a little worse a year ago when Verizon moved their tower to another spot about 1/2 mile away because lease prices were getting to high so it was cheaper to move their equipment to another tower. 

I switched and stayed with Verizon cause it’s the most consistent. Although it’s not always the fastest speed  I always have coverage so I stick with them. 

Just do some testing and see what works best for you. Best of luck."
30985,best country to live in,"I don't have knowledge of ideal countries. I was born in the US and will definitely live and retire in the US as I have been able to form real relationships all over the country and I have good quality of life here.

67985,best science fiction novel,"I would say that Redshirts and John Dies at the End are pandering to the modern era of writing. JDE is funny, but not groundbreaking. Red Shirts is mildly funny, but is basically a fan fic.

Ender's Game is epic and was a big deal, but it's basically juvenile wish fiction. Go with Ender's Shadow. Same story, but sounds less like a middle school kid feuding with bullies and grownups.

Replace JDE with something Asimov, Bradbury etc. If you have to stay weird, Mieville smiths words with the best of them.

Scalzi is good, so go with Old Man's War instead of his goofy fanfic novel.

Seveneves is also a recent. I think Snow Crash or Cryptonomicon would be better representatives."
