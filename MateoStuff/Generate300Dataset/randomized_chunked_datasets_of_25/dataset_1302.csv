4979,best home improvement store,I must be lucky. Where i live lowes and home depot are 30 minutes from my house and they are literally right across the street from each other. Ive gotten good and bad service from both though so now I go to the one thats gonna have the brand im looking for.
36871,best roller coaster at six flags,If you get to the park when it opens you should be able to score a few KK rides before anyone else makes it back there.
58805,best cologne,"It's true its popular but it smells amazing IMO. I like it more than all other colognes I've had: Aventus, Fierce, L'eau D'issey pour Homme, Polo Black, Gucci by Gucci. No lie I smell myself throughout the day when I wear AdG."
38502,best newspapers to read,"I read the Boston Globe when I'm home for the summer because my parents subscribe to it. I read my school's paper occasionally.

I recently got the actual paper like screen protector and it’s great and all but I kinda liked the dupe from Amazon better!"
68357,best science fiction novel,"I *love* A Fire Upon the Deep and all of Vinge's stuff. The sort of sequel, A Deepness in the Sky, is great as well. He has such brilliant ideas. 

I'm surprised The Three-Body Problem isn't on that list!"
21224,best workout music,GO HARD GETTIN' BUSY WIDDIT
2135,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,I prefer Woodstock's for SB pizza.
22418,best celebrity,"I met miss Dolly Parton when I was just a wee kid in Illinois.  I've described it as being like meeting the sun.  She was just so happy and warm and wonderful, and she was the first person I'd met in real life with a southern accent."
23291,best car racing video game,It's actually a pretty fun game if you like to have something to do while you listen to your music collection. The truck physics are also first rate.
11489,best gifts for dad,"You want a brass magnet and some blinker fluid, too?"
43002,best detective show,"Well, MindHunter obviously."
17576,best iOS game,Was sinkhole then added time xD. Also didn’t know timesink even existed as a word which I don’t believe it is since it’s been flagged as wrong as i wrote this.
45580,best gaming system,I got one for $20 from a used video game store near me like 3 years ago. It was a sale and they just had like 30 stacked up.
43809,best items under $100,"Girl here. Every med is different but some mess with libido/ability more than others, and some not at all. Sertraline (Zoloft) has worked the best for me. The worst was Prozac and escitalopram. Each person is different. The most important thing I can say is: give it time to work, and don’t stop taking it when you “start feeling better.” You’re feeling better because it’s working and stopping can put you back into the rut you just came out of."

Philip k dick - Ubik 
Haldeman - the forever Wars 
Philip k dick - do androids dream of electric sheep"

72576,best keyboard switches,"Brown. I like the tactile bump. I also like the click-sound that the blue switch has, but I think it would drive my girlfriend nuts."
47292,best state to visit in the United States,Upvoting as a Chicagoan. I've live in both Chicago and NYC for close to a decade. I prefer the food in Chicago. I love Chicago. I love everything about Chicago. But calling Chicago friendlier than NYC is a stretch. New Yorkers aren't rude. We just have rules. And you can strike up a conversation with a New Yorker at any time (provided they aren't busy). You can rarely strike up a conversation with a Chicagoan.
2490,best headphones,THIS.
67191,axios alternatives reddit,That's pretty much exactly what I am saying. It's stupid and unnecessary.
11369,best gifts for dad,"I was watching TV with my dad a little while ago and we saw a commercial for this universal wrench that does any sized nut or bolt. It was probably the first time that a commercial said 'innovation' and I agreed with them.

I looked at my dad and he looked back. No words were needed, only a few manly grunts and I knew it would be a good gift."
65438,best phone service company,"Yes! Great call, thank you. Updated the chart."
