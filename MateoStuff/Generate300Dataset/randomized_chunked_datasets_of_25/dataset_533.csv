9638,best dorm hall at UCSB,Anacapa gave me a great freshmen year.
1782,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I'd call it *almost* Chicago style. It's about half as thick as you could get in Chicago. Still though, very good pizza."
15667,best sunglasses for fashion,"**Ray\-Ban**

REAL ones from Amazon, Costco, Sunglass Hut \(on sale\), or Nordstrom Rack \(limited selection\) regularly drop below $100. Classic Wayfarer styles are less common as it's \*the\* prototypical pair of sunnies."
1602,best ice cream flavor,Parmesan with figs.
53658,best medicine for a cold,"Interestingly, I just checked [one of my sources](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571638) before writing a response and found out I misremembered. DM is actually not significantly more effective than no treatment at all (while a spoonful of honey is)."
15283,best tree for the garden,They are my favorite too as long as you have a male tree!!
66242,best soccer team in the world,"Bayern Munich don't have to face Real Madrid in the Bundesliga. Historically there were other strong teams in the Bundesliga like Gladbach once upon a time, and Hamburg for a while, but nowadays it is only really Dortmund and they're a far cry from the team which won back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012."
41029,best instrument to play,"Not true, there’s so much aim involved and people are so mean when you miss"

53026,best hiphop album,"Godfrey how do you find the time 

Good list btw"
25099,best spiderman actor,No u.
120,best terminal file manager reddit,"I'm strictly a terminal user when it comes to managing files (no file manager), but I downloaded Ranger and I'm impressed.  It's extremely responsive and the default vi bindings made it second nature to navigate."
30785,best country to live in,"What is this... Finland, you speak of?"
28958,best breakfast foods,"I've been told they are available at Costco as well. I'd imagine any bulk food store, Sam's Club, Costco, hell even Walmart might have them."
17309,best iOS game,GTA: San Andreas and Total War is great.
67726,axios alternatives reddit,"Axios won’t do that for you because it’s not going to wrap the Chrome APIs in promises for you. The Chrome APIs like storage.local only support callbacks. There is a great library from Mozilla that will do what you’re looking for though. It will allow you to use async/await with the main Chrome APIs:

[webextension-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webextension-polyfill)"
16142,best sunglasses for fashion,"WP has a bunch of new styles in the last year or two that are pricier. They're usually metal or mixed material or a limited run. Getting sunglass lens with a prescription also adds to the cost, as does high index lens if you've got a high power."
47797,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Instructors won't allow phones, tablets, or almost anything they don't explicitly recognize (and many things they do) because you can install things on them that allow you to cheat.  Even smartwatches aren't allowed because some people have figured out how to cheat using them.  (I don't know if it was via apps or just putting answers into images and displaying them.)  If it isn't an approved device, you often won't be allowed to use it.  It's even more strict in testing centers.  I can't even bring a *ruler* or my own graph paper into the testing center."
19650,best YouTube video,"Not originally on youtube, but classics from the days of flash web sites:

[Strong Bad Email #45 - Techno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwZwkk7q25I)

[Strong Bad Email #58 - Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90X5NJleYJQ)"
58819,best cologne,Bleu de Chanel is a fantastic everyday cologne.
46227,best trick or treating candy,"Ha ha ok got it. No Dum Dum pops sir.

Do kids just hate lolipops in general or is Dum Dum just the worst of the lot?

Someone gave me some organic sugar cane lolipops lately and they were delicious!"
35295,best alcoholic drink,"Moscow mule, uhmmm"
31476,best hotel to live in,"Marina Copan, in Copan Honduras, not too far from the Mayan ruins. It is like a colonial government house turned into a beautiful hotel. We got a room with 2 king beds and hot tub and a couch and high wood beamed ceilings, for about $80 per night. Amazing service too. We went during the ""rainy"" season, which really meant it rained once each afternoon from 3 to 5 pm. Great place,  and great time."
34684,best NFL player,Lol Tom Brady isn't the GOAT
67280,axios alternatives reddit,This thread did in fact make me go back and change from axios to wretch (which uses fetch) in a new project I am working on. The API feels very fluid and nice :D
