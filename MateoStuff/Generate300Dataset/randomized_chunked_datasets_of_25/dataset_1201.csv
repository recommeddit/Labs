60058,"If we're talking about fragrances under $25... that can be difficult, but there are some.

If you go to places like Burlington or TJ Maxx you can find Sarah Jessica Parker Lovely for an absolute steal. It's a beautiful, inexpensive clean musky floral that smells like it should retail for far more $$$ than it is. You'll also probably find CK One, it's a soft lemon-citrus scent that smells heavenly in the summer. You can also find Elizabeth Arden perfumes, Estee Lauder perfumes, many different celebrity perfumes, and some of the lower end designer perfumes at a significant discount. If you're on a budget I wouldn't recommend blind buying anything, look up the notes online and sniff anything that seems to be up your alley.

At the drugstore: for the low price Jovan Musk is good, and Coty's Wild Musk is another good one. You  have to enjoy the slightly more dirty musks though, they are both a bit animalic. They are not too challenging but they are not clean musks. You also might find Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose, a fantastic rose soliflore that goes for dirt cheap. The drugstore will probably have inexpensive dupes of designer perfumes as well, I'd definitely check em out.

As mentioned by many others, check out Pacifica's perfumes at Target. The fragrances are better than you'd expect and around $20-$25 for 1 oz. I was most impressed by French Lilac, I ended up buying it. In my opinion the other standouts are Himalayan Patchouli Berry (good fruitchouli), Tuscan Blood Orange (decent fruity orange scent), and Tahitian Gardenia (Tiare Flower soliflore). I was unimpressed by the vanillas, I'd reccomend skipping them. Also at Target is the brand Mix:Bar, their fragrance Bourbon Vanilla is much better than Pacifica's vanillas imo.",best perfume
