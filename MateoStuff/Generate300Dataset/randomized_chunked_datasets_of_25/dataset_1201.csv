I used to drink Full Throttle and then I saw how much the thing was destroying my stomach."

Perhaps I will do a proper write up, comment the code, and graph some suggestions and post it all together. If you guys would like I can post the code as is as well, but I don't know how comprehensible it would be."

60058,best perfume,"If we're talking about fragrances under $25... that can be difficult, but there are some.

If you go to places like Burlington or TJ Maxx you can find Sarah Jessica Parker Lovely for an absolute steal. It's a beautiful, inexpensive clean musky floral that smells like it should retail for far more $$$ than it is. You'll also probably find CK One, it's a soft lemon-citrus scent that smells heavenly in the summer. You can also find Elizabeth Arden perfumes, Estee Lauder perfumes, many different celebrity perfumes, and some of the lower end designer perfumes at a significant discount. If you're on a budget I wouldn't recommend blind buying anything, look up the notes online and sniff anything that seems to be up your alley.

At the drugstore: for the low price Jovan Musk is good, and Coty's Wild Musk is another good one. You  have to enjoy the slightly more dirty musks though, they are both a bit animalic. They are not too challenging but they are not clean musks. You also might find Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose, a fantastic rose soliflore that goes for dirt cheap. The drugstore will probably have inexpensive dupes of designer perfumes as well, I'd definitely check em out.

As mentioned by many others, check out Pacifica's perfumes at Target. The fragrances are better than you'd expect and around $20-$25 for 1 oz. I was most impressed by French Lilac, I ended up buying it. In my opinion the other standouts are Himalayan Patchouli Berry (good fruitchouli), Tuscan Blood Orange (decent fruity orange scent), and Tahitian Gardenia (Tiare Flower soliflore). I was unimpressed by the vanillas, I'd reccomend skipping them. Also at Target is the brand Mix:Bar, their fragrance Bourbon Vanilla is much better than Pacifica's vanillas imo."

3707,best college for research,"The exact opposite is true here in Singapore. The government wanted to boost their ranking they essentially funding a lot of research, many pointless, through the universities. This boosted their rankings and got more foreigners to enrol. 

I think our Mechnical Engineering is like 3rd best in the world. Did not feel that way when I was there. Place had a lot of professors who taught only because they had to, and exams were ripped off from previous years."

2549,best headphones,"Looks like you already bought, but [these](http://www.amazon.com/Rocketfish-RF-NCHP01-Atoms-Noise-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B006RBDEW2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407342722&sr=8-1&keywords=rocketfish+atmos) are great headphones for the price.  I used to work for the company that makes them (which is part of Best Buy) and private label products like this are very hit or miss.  In this case, it was a huge hit.  The engineers that worked on the design and testing in Minneapolis were very high on flat, authentic sound reproduction.  They're discontinued these days but still available on Amazon."
