"Zero is going to be more similar to what you're accostomed to from any other cloth pad. It's your safest route into artisan. If you want the best quality ""safe pad"", it's the zero.

"I'm also skeptical since there are TONS of different antibiotics which all have different molecular structures and mechanisms of action. Would be extremely unusual to be allergic to all (or even most) of them, but at the end of the day trust your doctor because they know what's up.
