2119,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Ok yes exactly this. Like yeah there are so many better/different pizzas in town but sometimes I just want Rusty’s lol

27374,best stocks to buy,"TSLA, since they are continually changing their busines model to disruptively attack areas with biggest possible revenue (starting with cars, going on to the energy sector, insurance sector and now it looks like they are even planning to enter the global workforce sector with the Tesal bot)

Waiting on Starlink/SpaceX IPO. That would be a no brainer insta-buy for me.

Other than that I'm looking around for anything that will profit off of climate change (i.e. energy storage, thermal storage, PV and wind energy companies). Unfortunately - particularly with storage - so far I see no clearly disruptive ones that can achieve global scope production. 

Vertical farming and meat substitute products also seem interesting and I'm keeping an eye on the relevant companies, but so far none seem to be gearing up to go massively global that would warrant a longterm investment.

AMZN if you don't care about ethics (which I do so I don't own any)."

34573,best NFL player,"I was thinking the same. I'd understand being in the back half a bit, but 17+ people leaping him in the past 10 years? I don't know about that.

But like someone else said somewhere, different voters this time around and maybe they just value you different things."
23472,best car racing video game,I loved playing Gran turismo as a kid. They managed to make little boy me get excited for a racing game even though I never really had any interest in the genre. So fun to drive your way up to whatever favorite car you had at the time (Dodge Viper btw!).

24173,best anime,"If nothing else, I just have to recommend Fate/Zero. If you like fighting, vast array of amazing characters, and a deep world to sink your teeth into, you can't go wrong with this show. It doesn't hurt that Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works just started up too
