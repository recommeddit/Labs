6532,"For me personally, I would definitely have to recommend Wild Wild Country for anyone who hasn’t watched it. Hands down one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen, and I’m still shocked all of this actually happened and I had no clue about it lol. 

It’s a limited series documentary on Netflix based on a controversial cult leader (Rajneesh ‘Osho’ Bagwan) who builds a utopian city in the Oregon desert, and shortly after conflict ensues with the locals and his followers which escalated into a national scandal. 

Found it to be extremely compelling, don’t want to say to much and ruin the gist of it but I highly recommend giving it a go if you haven’t already!",best Netflix documentary
