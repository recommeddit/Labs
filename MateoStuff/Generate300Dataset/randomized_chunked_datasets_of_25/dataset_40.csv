6532,best Netflix documentary,"For me personally, I would definitely have to recommend Wild Wild Country for anyone who hasn’t watched it. Hands down one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen, and I’m still shocked all of this actually happened and I had no clue about it lol. 

It’s a limited series documentary on Netflix based on a controversial cult leader (Rajneesh ‘Osho’ Bagwan) who builds a utopian city in the Oregon desert, and shortly after conflict ensues with the locals and his followers which escalated into a national scandal. 

Found it to be extremely compelling, don’t want to say to much and ruin the gist of it but I highly recommend giving it a go if you haven’t already!"

6627,best iPhone,"Not small sadly it will be quite a bit bigger than your current phone(same size as the X). I’m also looking at upgrading as my battery is fairly bad and my screen is now cracked on my 7. My main frustration is that if you want a smaller phone, the only options really are 8 (which is also fairly old at this point), SE gen 2 or 12 mini."
22286,best celebrity,"I have often had to defend my love of Kid Rock and his music to friends and co-workers who's best argument is ""he just looks so nasty and sleazy"".

I am glad a few people can share the sentiment and at least one redditor can attest to the fact."
