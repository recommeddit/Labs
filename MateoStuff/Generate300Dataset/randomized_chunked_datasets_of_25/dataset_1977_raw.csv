"You lucked out! When I was staying with my host family, she asked us the first night how we felt about toast. ""Fuck yeah, toast!"" said the college students.

She was very literal, Toast with butter and jam every morning with coffee and juice or Schorle.

6 weeks later, fuck toast."
Ms. Fat Booty anyone?
"I swear I want to dig it up, but I once saw that recommended in a threat where one of the criteria was ""interesting philosophical fantasy"" but also ""please no sexism""."
Do we want a sub\-$50 section?
Axios let's you cancel requests.  Most libraries do not.
"Again saying generally accepted (just like generally most people don't find Holland's movies good) doesn't mean that it's subjective.

Why are you lying in her having no TRAITS? She's not bland again that's subjective LMAO. So you admit it but now say it ain't explored too much? Just like about EVERY FEMALE LOVE INTEREST? HAHAHAHAHA At least it was shown how her life is.

After the graduation they didn't see each other again she probably moved out etc. because she was with Harry. Those rich people always chase her but she never settles down. What is poorly written? Dude you're being subjective as fuck here. Their romance is building in a form of 3 movies being cliche is a nitpick and subjective.

He definitely always had a thing for her that was developed throughout the movie. Again your part here is subjective just because she's getting saved doesn't mean that it's bad. Lmao"
"Out There is light?? My poor little brain!

Good list though; great to see Door Kickers getting some love."
Not all of those antihistamines will make you drowsy

Cubbies for sure.
"I thought in comparison to *Starship Troopers* and *The Forever War, Old Man's War* was very weak.  I read it immediately after *Forever War* and I found the exposition to be extraordinarily clunky in comparison.  All of the characters seem to have the same voice as well.  They all speak with the same lighthearted wit and jokes as well as sharing tone and voice."
Datpiff or where can I find them? Never heard of any.
Thanks so much. I’d like to go more in-depth but I feel like Bearded Bob and BadSeed Tech and RJN sorta cover that stuff and sometimes people are just looking for honest reviews and comparisons from the perspective of an average consumer.

LOVE Grapenuts with fresh raspberries...have you tried it?
That disrespect to Tom Holland though. Homecoming is the 2nd best Spidey movie. Behind 2 and ahead of the original.
Dark is pretty dark.
"Haha, that's definitely the way I see it!  Thanks!!!"
This book got me interested in advanced analytics. Much easier to understand the model whne you can just point and click as opposed to erring out code trying to upload a file.
"Get “Sorry”, friendships have been put to the test with this game of spite. Can remember playing this in elementary/junior high when it was too cold to go outside, develops profane vocabulary while devolving relationships if you’re into that sort of thing. Worth a shot nonetheless!"
"Go, seriously. It’s awesome. Also spend a day in one of the Roman baths. Soooo relaxing!"
