36042,best alcoholic drink,"Uhh, well the calories aren't what's gonna hurt your workout bud that would be the ""toxins"" in alcoholic drinks that make you hungover. Aside from the ethanol in alcoholic drinks that gets you drunk, there are other substances called congeners. These are byproducts of fermentation that give alcoholic drinks their flavor, and scientists think they also contribute to the feeling of being hungover (in addition to other factors like dehydration and loss of vitamins). Alcohols that contain less congeners are going to contribute less to a hangover, and are generally clear and of ""higher quality"". So, top shelf vodka for example, would be a good choice."
