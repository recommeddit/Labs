"> because they're stuck at a low pay scale

If they want to work on the technical side, yes. The business side (Sales, project/product management, field applications, etc for biotech and pharma) want people with biology-related degrees and experience, and they do quite well for themselves compared to a research associate"
"Anything in Iain Banks' 'The Culture' series. Those books completely changed my world view  to be honest.
