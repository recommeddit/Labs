Neil gaiman. During a signing event I had a darker book. He held up the line and looked for a silver pen so he could sign the book and just chatted to me while he hunted through this kids pencil case he had.
"I think he means that he's doesn't want to have stuff left over that he won't eat. So he just buys stuff that he would eat, himself."
"You should give Witcher 3 another shot, great game

Diablo 3 is a must play dude. Get it. NOW!

Each final fantasy game is its own story. They are not connected at all. So yes you can just buy FF15 and play it. Highly recommended."
"Anker makes great stuff and they stand by it. I had a multi-USB charger that one of the ports died on, and they sent me a new one, no questions asked."
"Ah, I see. Then, I think that paying more for a gaming laptop the Zephyrus G15 is not a good choice for you. 

Since build quality is a big concern, a business grade laptop is down your alley. The new [**HP Probook x360 435 G7**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-probook-x360-435-g7-notebook-pc-p-17g37ut-aba-1) is a good choice. It has a 6-core Ryzen 5 4500U, 16 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 13.3"" IPS touch 1,000 nit display. This model has the Sure View display, which is a privacy filter. That unfortunately limits viewing angles to an extent, but the display brightness is excellent."
"I love RTGame; helped me get through some dark, lonely times. He’s such a great guy who’s also absolutely hilarious!"
"But Chelsea have won the CL? Villa haven't won more than them. A more appropriate comparison would be you saying Villa should be ahead of Man City, which would be pretty much correct, Aston Villa are the bigger club"
"Geography, specializing in Geographical Information Systems. Super interesting and those guys are making bank."
"Mine, too. TIL I am a genius."
Come visit my home! It’s awesome
"I will speak for my twin sister on this one, as she tends to want to be in charge of my fashion choices. D&G The One cologne, Old Spice deodorant, and Irish Spring soap is one hell of a triumvirate.  

But apparently I'll have to buy Acqua Di Gio."
Oh nice. Yeah CBS is ass and Khalil Mack is the real deal.
my dad wears the Liverpool hat I got him a few years ago pretty much every time he leaves the house.
"Lucky Number Slevin is really underrated in my opinion.  It's not great, but I always found it very enjoyable."
Try the Skin Flute.
"Better elite status recognition, breakfast (actual breakfast not continental breakfast), upgraded suites etc. Often with fewer hurdles to go through than Marriott.  I think Marriott Platinum is something like 75 nights a year whereas starwood platinum is 25 stays or 50 nights.  Amex Platinum gives you Starwood Gold status for having the card.

Starwood lifetime gold status is 250 nights total (including award stays) and 5 years of having gold status (which you can get from the amex card or 30k spend per year), so it's easily attainable from any business traveler whereas Platinum is 500 nights."
"Thanks for pointing out the oddness of having JDE and Redshirts on the list. 

Scalzi is one of my favorite authors, but Redshirts isn't ""The Forever War"" or ""Dune."""
"Persona 5, The Witcher 3, Final Fantasy (7, 9, 10, 12), Soulsborne games, Tales of Berseria, Divinity 2"
*Eragon* by Christopher Paolini is one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read.
Los Agaves (De la Vina) and the Lark
"Depends which one. The px7 I wouldn't take even over some of these as bad as they are. 

There isn't many aptx LL headphones. But if you could get a good one then of course."
Neither is suitable for a beginner. As you probably know very well.
Oh these are the BEST!
Amen. I miss Freebirds ❤️
Lover eternal by J R ward. Something about Rhage and Mary's love was so raw and emotional!! It was beautiful.
