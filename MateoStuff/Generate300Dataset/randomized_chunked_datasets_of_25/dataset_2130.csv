36876,best roller coaster at six flags,"I agree with /u/provoaggie \- I'm pretty sure the above order is order of thrill or intensity, and NOT the order you should ride it in.

56607,best desktop monitor,"I only mentioned anti aliasing because the higher the resolution, the less jagged edges you are going to see.

62909,Best Data Science textbook,"If you follow ‚Äúuncle bobs‚Äù path you will be a gate keeper, unpleasant to work with and misogynistic. Some of his stuff is good,  but to many others it‚Äôs the equivalent of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an asshole‚Äù.

31725,best hotel to live in,That's cool! how big is your room? can you share any pictures of it?
54520,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hard to say... Likely hien is more durable, but that's just cause people have had them for a couple years and still going strong! We just don't have the data for the otsu v2 yet, but I can say it's very durable.
