Rolled oats, soaked overnight in a bit of water, with cut up or shaved apple, cinnamon, and (if it's cheap in your area) ground hazelnut. Serve warm or cold with milk. I usually add a wad of natural peanut butter.

Some variations use fruit juices or condensed milk. I find this way too sweet and therefore counterproductive from a health standpoint.",best breakfast foods

38285,"A difficulty you'll face in your search is the balance of resources available for effective reporting vs. pure objectivity. 

The Week and The Christian Science Monitor are wonderful sources of objective news. However, they are small. Neither has the reporting budget to break big stories on their own. They also don't have access. Washington insiders won't call up The Christian Science Monitor to leak a story. They'll call one of the big three, the NYT, the WSJ, or WaPo. 

Those big three have armies of reporters they can throw at stories. They can break news, important news, with resources smaller outlets cannot match. They will have sources inside Capitol Hill or the White House or national campaign organizations which smaller papers only dream about. This size comes at a price, though. All three have a subscriber base which they will not cross. 

I'm not capable of characterizing the biases of the big three insightfully enough for NeutralPolitics. Every reader can be perfectly objective on some topics, but every reader also has their biases which they do not recognize. This isn't the place for an argument. I don't think I can characterize the big three without starting one. 

I suspect you came here for a shortcut to an objective source. The best I can offer is to read all five until you have a sense of where they are strong and where they are weak.",best newspapers to read
