The quesadilla de mercado is hands down the best vegetarian dish in town.
"I'm a sucker for the Red Sunset Maple.  Nice looking tree.  Low maintenance.  Turns to a beautiful red-orange in the fall.  Even the leaves eventually on the ground looks pretty.  Grows at a good rate, but won't overwhelm the yard anytime soon."
"I really didn't expect to watch all of that, thanks for this."
"Shaq. My brother was living in Orlando in 1995 and I came to visit for the summer. At that time Shaq was playing for the Magic. We ran into him twice while stopped in traffic. Both times my brother, being the cornball that he is, beeped and started waving like crazy. I was so embarrased, but Shaq also beeped and started waving with a big smile on his face. Both times. From the way he reacted, you'd think we were the celebrities. 

By the way, he was driving a full size Chevy Suburban and it looked like he was sitting in the back seat. The guy was astoundingly huge."
I prefer tap but I don’t care that much
"I really like King's Island and Hersheypark.  Sure, CP has extreme coasters but the overall  experience just isn't what it used to be.  Also on a smaller level with basically all fantastic coasters look no further than Knoebels and Holiday World.

*Note: Exclude parks out of the US."
"Any bio degree + computer science opens you up for bioinformatics as well, which is a lesser known but super interesting field. There is so much data being generated by research now that it's difficult for humans to analyze it all, so computers are being used more and more to parse and analyze all this data. There still aren't a ton of people that know enough about both biology and CS to do bioinformatics, though, so it's a good field to get into."

Money has nothing to do with it.
"La Super Rica RULES !!! Undoubtedly the best food, second to none - in price, taste, choice, and quality.  However its restaurant ""environment"" is nothing to speak of, - it is what it is.  No servers, you place your food order and pay for it standing at a window, you  pickup the food at a second window, and you eat it on a picnic table under their roofing, or you bounce out and take it with you (always MY choice)."
"I live in Frisco and found the same thing. We had been on Verizon a few years ago and it was fine. Then we switched to TMo a couple years ago when I started with a new company and got a good deal on TMo service and they basically paid off our two iPhone X to switch. Service was okay but for me more inconsistent than Verizon.

We just switched back to Verizon in October when they were giving $550 per iPhone X trade value and a $250 gift card for each line we brought in.

For me, I feel like the service is back to being more consistent than TMo. My wife says for the places she is most often (work, gym, etc) that Verizon is worse than TMo.

I think basically they’re all going to be generally pretty similar in larger metro areas - overall solid, but with certain areas that are better on one carrier than the other.

My parents are still on TMo in the Dallas area and said that it’s great for them. I have lots of friends on ATT in the Dallas area who say that overall it’s good. 

Next time I’m considering switching, or just want to see if a service is better I’ll get a prepaid SIM for ATT and TMo and put them through their paces before making a decision.

But overall, I’m pleased with Verizon, but as with any of this, location can make a big difference."
I'd say its a high risk high reward one. Panasonic is 10 times safer but potential upside is also probably an order of magnitude less.
"I'm still pissed at that clip.  When it came out, like the day after, I had an idea.  I took that clip and added the Billy Madison judge saying ""what you have just said...""  I went viral, like 100K views in 6 hours.  This was a LOT back then.  YT removed the video for copyright claims and gave me my third strike which nuked my account.  Still to this day, both of those clips are uploaded on many account, by me putting them together is somehow wrong?"
"I'm a big fan of Gilmore Girls: I watched it as it aired through high school and my early years in college and loved the dialogue. I'm re-watching it through Netflix now, and some of the pleasures in the writing is just now clicking. I find it really rewarding as a viewer, but I do recognize its repetitiveness. Maybe that's part of why I love it though: it's a reliable friend. Paris, for example, cunningly refers to the 5-hour film Shoah twice in separate seasons. 

A large part of what works about Gilmore Girls for me is actually not the dialogue. Rather, it's the small town world it creates alongside that dialogue. Now, I'm not from such a place, but GG does a damn fine job of creating *a representation of* a small town. The informed references thus sometimes have the feel of being too smart to be true: like Rory talking about Boogie Nights while still in high school and Lorelai making a reference to The Brown Bunny. ""Small town"" people presumably don't talk about these things. So I'm rambling a bit, but my point is this: the combination of the small idyllic town setting and the fast-paced references that rival an urban, Woody Allen-like world make for a heck of a mother-daughter show. It pulls off being just strange enough."
"It's never bothered me either, but Aquafina actively makes me gag because it tastes stale to me."
Thanks a lot!!
"In a similar vein, try Aruba if you can afford it. When looking up safety tips, the only warning I saw was ""try to avoid the oil refinery at night... there haven't been any incidents but it's been reported that it feels a bit on the shady side""

I know friends who've gone on vacations to resorts in Mexico and Cuba, and how there are armed guards on the beaches. Sounds less than relaxing to me..."
You right I cried.
"Fried bread - take a slice of bread and fry it in oil, you have fried bread."
"This was a great read! Thank you for the info, got something new for myself!"
"Hey! I recently saw my 50th state using one of those 45 day Amtrak rail passes. I didn't see all 50 this trip, but over the course of the last 6 years. Here's a few highlights from my trips:

- Barrow, Alaska. You can't really get a similar experience anywhere else in the world. The sense of serenity and peace is incredible, and it's really hard to believe you are still in the United States.

- Alburquerque, NM. Go up the mountain in the skycar. Desert views unlike anywhere else I've been on the planet. Also great cuisine and roadrunners (not related).

- Portland, OR. Weird and wonderful, and I hope to  move here permanently one day. Beautiful women, beautiful landscape, quirky folk.

- Houston, Tx. The space centre is a must. Maybe go another time though.

- New Orleans, Louisiana. INCREDIBLE Jazz scene, I think it's the only place I've seen somebody play a washboard to a crowd of cheering drunks. Bourbon street is a must, but only once. Venture all round the French Quarter, and then out into more of the city. I LOVED the world war 2 museum.

- Los Angeles, California. This was my least favourite place but you have to see it so you can wash the stars from your eyes. Hollywood is an absolute dump, there are shanty towns of homeless people downtown and there seems to be little to no interest paid to them from the locals. It's not the only city with a homeless problem, but it's definitely one of the worst.

These are the ones that come to mind immediately, and I've spread them far enough apart that you'd have to see plenty more between them along the way. America is an INCREDIBLE country."
"Pretty good timing with this thread for me, need a laugh."
"I agree. I loved both of them, but Spiders was by far my favorite. I'm looking forward to Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits."
"A mini hand held vacuum was one of the best purchases my wife made this year lol. It’s so useful for cleaning the couches, small messes or the car.

* the one we got was this one from Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRLXG3C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabt1_bF0QFb4H0906Q?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

It was pretty cheap so any big brand would probably be better"
We must live in the same town!
