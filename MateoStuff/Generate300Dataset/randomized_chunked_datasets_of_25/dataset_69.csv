55595,"I'll jump in here, because I read most of that series as it was coming out.

The first few books captivated me.  The overall story is pretty derivative, but it was done in a good, character-driven way and with a few novel ideas.  I was really rooting for Richard and Kahlan (the main protagonists/romance factor), and I loved Zed (the main side character).  At some points in the plot I just rolled my eyes, but overall I was looking forward to each book.

Then the preaching begins.

You don't notice it at first.  But by the middle of the series (book 5, I'd say), Goodkind is *really* beating you over the head with his objectivist philosophy, cramming whole sermons into the story and leaving absolutely zero room for ambiguity or realistic argument.  Basically the author's ideology takes over the story.  It's a similar problem that Ayn Rand's work suffers from - you enjoy it at first, until you get tired of the obvious (and incidentally, flawed) agenda.

In addition to this, Goodkind himself has said some pretty strange things on the record.  He thinks a great deal about himself, and he doesn't think much of the genre he writes in, as seen in this widely circulated quote:

> ""First of all, I don’t write fantasy. I write stories that have important human themes. They have elements of romance, history, adventure, mystery and philosophy. Most fantasy is one-dimensional. It’s either about magic or a world-building. I don’t do either.""

It seems that he only uses fantasy as a vehicle to push his philosophy, and for me, that's a turn off.

It's really against my nature to dissuade someone from reading something.  And if it wasn't for the fact that the series is like a dozen books long, I'd say give it a try anyway.  But I just wanted to let you know about these issues, because nothing sucks more than investing weeks and weeks in a story and then giving up on it.",best action and adventure novel series
