Maybe you should be an NFL kicker if it's such a breeze
"I can attest that UGREEN and CHOETECH are superior brands. These are Chinese brands. Not only for USB-C cables, but also for other items. Here in the Philippines, especially in the Macbook community, when a computer accessory is needed... UGREEN is the go-to shop in Lazada and Shopee."
"I just received a copy. Elephant Laboratories are selling them direct from their website. $70, shipped pretty quickly."

"Not in any order

Imperial Assault, tactical skirmish, rpg story and Star Wars

Mage Wars, very interesting take on Card game with tactical elements

Cosmic Encounters, just crazy backstabbing fun with friends, very simple to learn with a lot of interesting stories

Time Stories, probably the best adventure coop puzzle board game i have played, my group loves this one.

Pandemic or Pandemic Legacy, amazing game about stopping a virus from ending the world, very deep and also very simple to learn

Scythe, a really unique building type game with a lot of depth and strategy.

Werewolves or Spyfall, probably the best party deception games.

Earth Reborn, best mix of tactical mini game and board game, build your own scenarios which gives it unlimited replayability.

Carcassonne or Catan, depends on your group if you go for one or the other, but my group prefers Carcassonne.

Clank, just a really easy to learn, fun, deckbuilder.

Runewars, very well done RTS style board game with everything in an RTS computer game in board style.

Mage Knight, awesome rpg game with a lot of depth and more to it then you can easily explain.

Havenfall, no one knows about this game but i cant recommend it enough, if you like old style adventure rpg games from the NES era then check this out.

Mysterium, awesome game basically like an advanced more interactive version of Clue.

Merchants and Marauders, this game is just great fun, and has interesting mechanics, and the best pirate themed game IMO."
