Wat?! Why is it super expensive on amazon and ebay then?
"I only own the base model of Xbox One, which has its own shortcomings, but I really like it for its convenience and versatility.

The price/value ratio is unbeatable considering how cheap it is when on sale (I even got my spare BNIB All-Digital edition during the BF sales for 79â‚¬ (approx. 89$), which is just insane).

3TB external drive + about 75 favorite games in total ranging from the 6th-gen titles such as Panzer Dragoon Orta or SSX 3 to the current fan favorite AAA ones like Dark Souls 3 or Doom = what more could a (rather casual) gamer like me want?

Also, 10 TB worth of movies and shows in 1080p/4k - no problem, because KODI

Also, 4k Blu-Rays - no problem, because 4k UHD Blu-Ray drive"
"Playing NWN right now and it's great, but probably should have the tag ""best on iPad"". On my phone it's playable but the text is very small and there's not an option that I can find to increase its size."
My only annoyance is the small bore. It's easier to drink out of Evian than it is Fiji. Evian has a big ol' hole.
">  when even the actors themselves were shocked by it in the theater?

What do you mean?"
According to the show's Wikipedia page it's going to film next year.
"Piffle.

Mint provides plenty of benefits over Ubuntu. For one thing it offers a better choice of UIs than Ubuntu has done for years, with its efforts to try to ram Unity down our throats, now finally abandoned. The Mint developers have not repeatedly tried to monetise their efforts by sharing user information with 3rd parties, unlike Canonical. It's a genuine non-profit operation run by people who believe in open source -- very different from a corporation seeking to co-opt it for profit.

You have no idea how many (few) were affected by downloading compromised ISOs years ago and to go on bleating about it years later is ridiculous."
"I don't really have a top 10 necessarily, but 10 I love... Kouros, Jicky, Leather Oud, Caron Pour un Homme, AdP Colonia, Eau d'Hermes, Chanel Pour Monsieur, Interlude Man, Dama Bianca, Declaration."
"Kentucky, WTF are you doing?"
"I totally read the comment as Rand Paul. However, Ron Paul was a self proclaimed Libertarian which is about as pro-oligarchy as one can be"
Doris is mine by a long shot tbh

Wow really? I'm loving this holiday more and more!
In my neck of the woods they started labeling the bay number on the floor in paint and the shelf number with stickers. It's almost as good as having turn by turn gps inside the store.

Forgive me, I am so bad in cologne/perfumes. What is the difference between Eua de Toilette spray and Eau de Parfum? And is the intense better?"
"I looked for the same thing a few months ago, a headset that got very high quality sound and are also wireless, I tried a few and send them back, Then I went for the Bose one after I saw it being recommended again and again (the number 2 model on this list [https://digitalaquarius.com/best-headphones/](https://digitalaquarius.com/best-headphones/) ) and it basically changed my life, audio quality is awesome but more than anything is the noise canceling on those are insane. Also they are super comfortable on my ears! I can wear them for hours at at time and it does not bug me at all (had a sony before and couldn't wear them more then an hour without having to take a break)"
The stars my destination was so good. Such a great adventure to read.
Bass drum is way easier than cymbals.
I love that show! Lots of red herrings.
"Either my Netflix is broken, or everyone who is telling me some of these movie are on Netflix are either in another country than the US, or aren't doing recent searches (remember things cycle out all the time).

Also, it seems Disney owned stuff is being pulled right now, in preparation for their new streaming service. 

Prestige is a Touchstone release, therefore under the Disney umbrella."
"I dunno, I zoomed in really close. It was pretty big."
