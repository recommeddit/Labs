30360,"The Spanish Civil War is missing right there, in between the great depression and WW2. A war among two different monarchists, radical catholics, rich, fascists, democrats, poor, anarchists, communists, russians, germans, italians... Nearly every ideology in the world fought that war. There were even civil wars within the Civil War, coups d'etat on one side, the lot. In the meantime, the whole world was awaiting the outcome to see what would happen in the rest of Europe; nobody who mattered on the democracy side (France, Britain, the US) did shit because they were too scared about bothering Hitler in some way.

Maybe in 200 years' time we'll see it as the European Wars. It all started with the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and finished with the Yugoslav War of the 90's, the collapse of the USSR, and the reunification of Germany.",best Mexican war to study
54850,"yeah, Iodine is a halogen and thus oxidizes compounds pretty well. When disinfecting or inactivating microorganisms, what is actually occurring is that the disinfectant is oxidizing the microorganism and killing it. So iodine is behaving much like chlorine would.

I believe that iodine used to be used in swimming pools.  The drawback to iodine is color and taste. I'm not sure that it is AS effective as bleach, I've not really looked into it.",best water filter

72758,"Hmm, at the moment most lightweight mice (<80 grams) are wired. There might be several new wireless lightweights coming out this year, Wireless Hati, GPW X, Wireless Finalmouse. Current options are obviously Viper U and the GPW. Both of those are expensive though, and I own neither so others could probably be more informative. The GPW does have time on its side though, and the only issue people report consistantly is double clicks.

I don't know what I would do if I were you, the Model O would probably be a less expensive way to experience a lightweight ambi mouse. Their new cable looks fantastic so I'd make sure to get a current unit. So yeah, unless you're in a rush to try wireless tech, I'd try a wired mouse that's vastly different from the DA, just so you know what kind of shape and weight you like.",best wireless lightweight mouse

58774,"""Find that one perfect fragrance for you, and use ONLY that. You should NOT have a variety of scents based on the situation or your mood. They are NOT like clothes. Your fragrance should serve as an subtle, pleasant, reminder of you. An unconscious reference, but it has to become that over time. That won't happen if you alternate scents. Do - not - alternate - scents""

This statement is very, very debatable and very, very opinionated. And that is a supper strong opinion. Personally, I disagree, and I bet 99% of people into fragrances share my opinion. Some fragrances are designed for certain situations, or are just more appropriate. I wouldn't where a fragrance that projects heavily and smells very strong and weird to work for instance. I might however, wear it at a bar or something.

I just find your opinion on this incredibly harsh. I understand that it is an opinion, but the way it is worded just comes off as combatant against others who disagree.

Why do you feel fragrances are so static, and should never be alternated? I like to look appreciate fragrances and their effect on scent memory and association.

I hope no one reads your comment and takes your opinion as something other than that, and never discovers how amazing fragrances can be.

Also, Macy's fragrance department is sometimes staffed by contractors from a fragrance house. They are extremely biased because their job is not to sell you anything other than the house they represent.",best cologne
