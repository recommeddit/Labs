7706,"Thanks for your recommendations! I’m definitely considering the Lenovo flex 5 though for the lighter weight, touch screen, and higher ram (although I could upgrade the idea pad you just mentioned). Also since you’ve stated it’ll be more than powerful with the ryuzen 5, I’m gonna go for it. Hope it lasts a while and that I enjoy using it! 

Only condition is that I buy it strictly for $600 though. I’m gonna keep an eye out for Amazon retail to be selling it and go for it. Thank you legos45!",best laptop for general use
8932,"fluorosis is tough to treat. even if you were able to whiten the rest of your teeth to the level of the fluorosis spots, that might be too white.  but thats pretty subjective.

you also have restorative options.  depending on how bad the fluorosis is, a dentist might either restore just the spots in composite resin, or the entire front of the teeth in question with porcelain veneers.  but whitening is the more conservative treatment.",best toothpaste

You wouldn’t believe how much your fandom of someone is affected by how they are in real life. Before Sandler was a regular at my job, I liked some of his movies but since he’s come in a bunch I think he’s great and I found myself watching more Sandler stuff.",best celebrity

29729,"Services like Signal do this really well. I believe they have the details written up how they've implemented the security stuff on their site somewhere.

iMessage as well. The encryption keys themselves are generated and stored locally on each device. While this has some wonkiness to it at times it generally has gotten better over time for me. And I appreciate the difficulty they have to contend with here. 

The biggest one that does this is 1Password's new subscription service. They even have a white paper that describes the details of how it works  in language that is very readable. They don't store anything on their side that can even be used to facilitate cracking. 

I believe Keybase may be of interest as well. Though I'm not totally sure if they base a bunch of it on GPG or their own stuff these days. It's a super neat service, but it's also incredibly confusing due to GPG not being used for their new teams, chat, and git services.",best money managing app

40997,"I think the main difference is the learning curve. Piano is easier because you can produce a good sound straight away and you make huge progress at the beginning. Then it becomes way harder and practicing hard pieces takes a lot of time, sometimes more than other instruments. In fact, pianists are known to be among the ones who practice the most hours. Other instruments require less hours of daily practice.... But that's not because they are easier maybes just that they tire you more and it's not useful to play more.

Piano compares to other instruments is also more versatile and pianists are required to have a lot of different skills: from being a soloist to an accompanist to a collaborative pianist etc. This means also perfecting sight reading and learning pieces in a short amount of time which becomes definitely harder and time consuming than for example a wind instrument.

And in the end, trascendental technique is very hard to achieve and especially to maintain: you either practice a lot everyday or you lose every fluency you had. And perfecting the touch is very hard, especially since you have to play on different instruments. The potential mistakes are a lot, I feel like it's easier to mess up blatantly playing piano because mistakes are easily recognizable.

That being said all instruments are difficult, some at the begging, others at the end, and if you want to play seriously you have to put a huge amount of effort into it which includes also studying scores, theory etc.",best instrument to play
