64653,"I work for Nike in the running section and all of this information is completely spot-on.  Each employee was taken on a very thorough walkthrough of each shoe's technologies and the information presented here is all very accurate.  The article didn't make mention of some features like Flywire, or the difference in cushioning between the very similar Pegasus and Vomero lines, but I found this to be a good read even though I work with the products each day.",Best Nike running shoes

72399,"The type of switch matters less for the game itself and more for your preference and surroundings. Do you want straight linear switches that just go down to the body of the keyboard or do you want tactile keys that make an audible and sensory click when they actuate? Is your setup close to other people or do you talk to other people in discord as you play, because tactile clicky switches like browns and blues might be satisfying to the touch, they are loud and blast everyone else with their sound as opposed to linear switches like the reds.

Personally I have red switches and after some getting used to they work fine for siege, and in the end any switch of quality will do, it’s just up to you.

If you really aren’t sure order a tester board off of Amazon that has all the types of switches on it so you can try them out in real life and decide.

PS the switches I refer to are the Cherry MX switches.",best keyboard switches

I was the only comp ling major the year I graduated and even other graduating linguistics students had no idea what my major was. Somebody even looked at my sash and thought my major was called ""confrontational linguistics"". Pre-pandemic, I believe the department wanted to do a little series called ling-what-stics as a lot of people seem to have no idea what linguistics is and assume it means we all speak like 10 languages.",best major to study in college
