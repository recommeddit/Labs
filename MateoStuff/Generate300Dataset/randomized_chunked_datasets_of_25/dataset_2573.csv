17311,best iOS game,"Take a look at unmemory, a mix of reading and puzzles.
https://unmemory.info/"
69092,best science fiction novel,"Legacy of Heorot    
Eden series (Harry Harrison)    
The Martian"
45113,best items under $100,"Bought a '92 Squire Stratocaster for $99 a few months ago. It's sounds great and feels great too, better than some of my other $1000 + guitars. Just goes to show the expensive ≠ better, and each instrument should be judged unprejudiced and unbiased."
64653,Best Nike running shoes,"I work for Nike in the running section and all of this information is completely spot-on.  Each employee was taken on a very thorough walkthrough of each shoe's technologies and the information presented here is all very accurate.  The article didn't make mention of some features like Flywire, or the difference in cushioning between the very similar Pegasus and Vomero lines, but I found this to be a good read even though I work with the products each day."
11315,best gifts for dad,"Also, being a good husband to one person doesn't mean you're going to be a good husband to everyone."
28006,best breakfast foods,Pancakes are inferior waffles. Change my mind.
62051,Best RPG game on PS4,Fenyx for whatever reason took me a little bit to get into. Like I had to try to get into the game but I'm glad I finally did because it's been awesome so far. (I'm prob a little more than half way through it) And I've been told before to try out Nier so maybe I should at some point lol.
38741,best web browser,"on windows, edge is *bestest* but consider brave, firefox, vivaldi"
72399,best keyboard switches,"The type of switch matters less for the game itself and more for your preference and surroundings. Do you want straight linear switches that just go down to the body of the keyboard or do you want tactile keys that make an audible and sensory click when they actuate? Is your setup close to other people or do you talk to other people in discord as you play, because tactile clicky switches like browns and blues might be satisfying to the touch, they are loud and blast everyone else with their sound as opposed to linear switches like the reds.

Personally I have red switches and after some getting used to they work fine for siege, and in the end any switch of quality will do, it’s just up to you.

If you really aren’t sure order a tester board off of Amazon that has all the types of switches on it so you can try them out in real life and decide.

PS the switches I refer to are the Cherry MX switches."
21154,best workout music,Black label by lamb of god works wonders for squats.
52473,best hiphop album,Facts bro.. for me Kanye has 2 albums that represent what the culture of the world was... Which was Graduation in 2007 and MBDTF in 2010...
6235,best Netflix documentary,"I wouldn't call Waco a docudrama, its a drama loosely based on the actual Waco event"
43217,best detective show,"Lots of great suggestions here, am making notes to watch some. I'd also add the HBO series Carnivale, it's incredible. TD S1 is my favorite season of any show ever, and Carnivale is my favorite series. Sadly it was cut short after just 2 seasons even though the creator of the show had a 6 season arc planned out."
72016,best movies with a cool twist,"a beautiful mind
i watched it not knowing anything about the movie or the person it was made about and was really surprised haha"
40329,best midrange CPU,No the performance aspect is good.
14155,best place to get free books,"They definitely are, especially since they usually get passed through legal mediators like Amazon, just gotta be careful these days."
53230,best usb c charging cable,See top post https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/ia11ao/is_there_a_better_quality_of_usb_c_cable/g1mq76t/
37260,best amusement park,"Sure, I mistakenly thought this was based on something else. That makes sense, at least a little bit. Still seems weird that this many areas draw KD without it having that great of attendance."
27946,best breakfast foods,Chorizo and cheese burrito with a bit of hot sauce. Real ground chorizo withe the egg scrambled right into the meat.
35118,best NFL player,"In my defense, I hit the return button every time I typed out a name. Seeing how it turned out after I submitted it hurt my brain too"
35728,best alcoholic drink,"Gonna have to try this, I always have gone with bourbon."
70613,best major to study in college,"Perhaps linguistics. When I was a student, we had about 70 students in the entire department. My specific major (computational linguistics) had about 6 or 7 students. I was the only comp ling major the year I graduated and even other graduating linguistics students had no idea what my major was. Somebody even looked at my sash and thought my major was called ""confrontational linguistics"". Pre-pandemic, I believe the department wanted to do a little series called ling-what-stics as a lot of people seem to have no idea what linguistics is and assume it means we all speak like 10 languages."
52610,best hiphop album,It's amazing Hieroglyphics isn't better known.
15840,best sunglasses for fashion,"Somebody downvoted you for this comment, equally as ridiculous as the comment you replied to getting downvoted.

Oakley has had that Asian fit for years, I remember looking on their website awhile back and being pretty happy that Asians were getting considered by a company."
66541,best soccer team in the world,Glad to remember we came back into the top40. 31st rn and Im only hoping that with another successful AFCON we can challenge where we were in 2014
