32587,best vacation resort,"I came to the same consensus after our honeymoon.  While it's nice to not have to worry about money while on the trip, I don't think it was worth the added expense.  I believe I could've received comparable service and drinks for the same cost at a non-inclusive resort.  Also, I know I would have received much better food.

However, when traveling on hotel points I prefer the all inclusive resorts because I don't have to worry about spending money on food or drinks."
