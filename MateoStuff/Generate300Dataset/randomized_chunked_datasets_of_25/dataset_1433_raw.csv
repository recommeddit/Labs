Best I can do is a used car battery and a Radio Flyer
Thank you for your feedback! I will start learning cmd right away
"Have you tried using Microsoft Edge? I know it sounds nuts, but their PDF reader is solid."
"I love that bit! After hearing it, I never looked at candy corn the same again"
"SFFT for the win! I honestly love that park. There's something that just feels different when you visit. Everything just seems so upbeat and perfect, it's the farthest thing from a Six Flags."
"I used these with my 2 XL and still do with my 3 XL

"Possession by A. S. Byatt

Mary Stewart had some great romantic suspense books, Wildfire at Midnight, Nine Coaches Waiting and My Brother Michael were some of my favorites.

Gone With the Wind is a classic likewise Forever Amber"
Knotts has a very far reach apparently...
"It's amazing to see keyflower getting so much love, surrounded by much flashier games but holding its own"

That said every film I would say is net positive (though the last two are right on the line). I can elaborate if anyone wants me to."
"The Guilty (2018) has a great twist. It's not the best in movie history or anything, it's just on my mind because I saw it recently."
I guess I’ve just always used thicker cases. I’m usually working at high heights or around heavy machinery
"Upstart. Etsy. Google. Lucid. Airbnb. 

I would add ETFs TECL and UPRO."
"If you don't mind going over counter, you can get a single housing countertop one with faucet for about 100, and filter replacement costs are 12/year with a carbon filter.

If your water is super dirty, you can get double and tripe housing ones too! More upfront but cheapest in the long run and way better than a Brita in terms of what it filters out."
"As a Gentoo and Arch user, I agree."
"TDs are very volatile year to year, interceptions a little less so, completion percentage is very stable, but also more indicative of offensive style and not something related to winning until you start getting shockingly low."

Influence is a whole different story to an albums' quality, otherwise we'd be calling Rappers' Delight the greatest hiphop track OAT"
"Brady will be too, SB champ and the GOAT isn't out of the top 10"
I'm gonna have to check this place out.
Everyone will see it coming if you do though.  Not much point in copying a joke like that.  But hey do what you gotta do.
