Everyone gets a kick out of the political commentary of the Page 3 girls.
"It seems to be somewhat random. Aside from random stuttering the first 30 seconds (alongside audio latency glitching), it ran absolutely fine on my much older rig - GTX 1070/i5 6600k. It might like higher clocks or something, I don't know. But non-dice Frostbite games seem to always have issues with stuttering for a random amount of people playing. I remember playing Jedi Fallen Order very smoothly the first time, but now that I reinstalled it a month ago it's a stuttery mess - I haven't changed any hardware since.

It might be a good try to install any newer game on SSD, devs seem to be caring less and less about HDD streaming on PC"
OMG I havent watched that vid in like 2 years. classic
That's not correct. By that definition wouldn't every game be classified as an RPG then?
"Nice work

Wondering if anyone on xfinity family plan and do have an open spot to join?"
The third playthrough of Nier Automata is one of my favorite video game moments of all time.
oh actually wasn't aware of that thx
Amaretto sour. Tastes like candy
Oh god me too. I'm so ashamed
Rocky Road!

That's... That's not *cookies* and cream. Did they label it as such or were you just eating chocolate chip ice cream?
The game twist was the most original and creative of them all in my opinion. I will surely check out The sting!
I know for a fact that they are on visible
I just finished housesitting a place with a grey kitchen. It made me want to hang myself
"I still love Bombshell by Victoria's Secret. It's what I get the most compliments on by far. That, and Moschino Funny or Hippy Fizz."
"Applied Predictive Modeling is my favorite.  So many statistics books are ""Here's a technique, here are a bunch of proofs, here's how to use this technique on a canned problem.""  There's little discussion of why to pick a particular technique over another one, or how to solve a real world problem with messy data.

Applied Predictive Modeling is a book that assumes you know basic statistics and want to predict things.  There's little discussion of coefficients outside of ""After centering and scaling, magnitude could help"", and no canned problems.  It teaches you a bunch of techniques useful for a given type of problem, then goes through a case study on a real, messy dataset, explaining the decision process, how they picked features, and how they picked what models to try out.  It also has R code built on top of the caret package that lets you run all of this (although admittedly, it's REALLY old R code.)

I can't recommend this book enough."
"i think it’s insane when people make 3d stuff in desmos. this isn’t exactly what i was looking for, but it’s still really cool."
"I'd say hit and run isn't all that great on PC, the built in controller support is wonky and has issues with newer controllers, along with weird compatibility issues with new version of windows, overall I just found it was easier to emulate.

but good call on battle on bikini bottom, it's actually a very solid platformer/actiony game, and it's faithful to the source material (i was a big fan as a kid, and my younger cousins like it, so i'm still pretty familiar.)

edit: oh god i forgot about the PC version of battle for bikini bottom. but whats the issue with deadpool (besides it not being a very good game)?"
Agreed. One of the very best. Also i didn't see god of war on your list. Definitely check that one out if you haven't.
"Yeah it all comes down to opposition, and his opposition for 99% of his games was abysmal. 

The fact that he also did well at World Cups shouldn't be ignored and I'm not trying to dismiss that. He's a legend of the game, just not in that top tier."
Nirvana Bourbon by Elizabeth & James. Smells like sex
"This feels so unisex, it's hard to tell. I'm going to guess you're a guy in his 20s, eclectic taste to match the fragrances. Feels like someone who works an office job but enjoys doing more exciting things for hobbies and on the weekend to make up for a kind of boring workplace."
you are a savior
The Appalachian Trail through Shenandoah NP is a good place to start. I also second Smokey Mt. NP. Mt. Katahdin in ME is Awesome as well.
