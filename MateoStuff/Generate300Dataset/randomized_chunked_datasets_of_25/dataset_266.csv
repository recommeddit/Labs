19266,best YouTube video,My GF wish she could become pregante
52402,best hiphop album,"I'll slow it down for you, Kendrick is massively overhyped and not even the best rapper on TDE. Ab-Soul is. His album Control System is better than either of the Kendrick albums on this list."

18308,best YouTube video,All of those adult swim cutaway commercials are excellent. “Unedited footage of a bear” is also hilarious.
44812,best items under $100,"Platinum tier: Japanese cotton and linen bed sheets!!! ($80-200 depending where u buy from)I can never go back to cheap ikea bedsheets 

Gold tier: dual Monitor arm ($50 from amazon: clears up desk space and and I can watch from whatever angle)"

25570,best cricket teams of all time,"oops,sorry i forgot them totally."
51301,best iphone case,"Spigen’s thin fit with their stick-on kick stand for my pro max. Once their slim armor with the built in kick stand comes out I’ll get that. 

If anyone else is looking at Spigen cases buy them on Amazon. They’re 1/3 the price."

51802,best iphone case,"Your photo series for your phone cases are INSANE. 

Also I cant believe you did not review a single case from Otterbox. Come onnnnn"
7681,best laptop for general use,"Just broke my laptop so I'm in the market for a replacement- the screen broke because slept on it accidentally. Also the hinges were falling apart, so a good build would be important (It'll spend most of it's life on my bed). Battery doesn't have to be the best. I would use it for general internet browsing, streaming videos, and reading (I usually have a lot of tabs open) though I also do some light gaming (Minecraft, terraria, stardew valley, and some browser games). My budget is around $600-$800 though I can go a bit higher. Any recommendations? (Other than not sleeping with my laptop next to me)"
42017,movies like Inception,"I don’t have a problem with the all female casts reboots of other popular movies. But I’m a little bummed that this original sci-fi movie with an almost all female cast that is AMAZING got so swept under the rug. 
I try to tell everyone I can to watch this."
70731,best movies with a cool twist,"It never worked for me, partly because I didn't believe they wouldn't realise the dead body wasn't dead over so many hours. Also because the way the black guy (Zep?) was menacing the wife and child with a gun went beyond anything he was forced to do, so the film was a bait and switch for me.

I preferred the later films. For example, Saw II:  >!the footage we thought was live was actually recorded days earlier!<."
13451,best spreadsheet editor,Have you tried out the new Quickoffice. Its free now and integrates well with Google Drive but also supports offline editing of locally saved stuff just like the classic Quickoffice.
53070,best hiphop album,First listen didn’t do much for me but I’m eternally grateful I didn’t just give up then and there. Top 5 general album for the year unless the final four months are uncannily good
37854,best Marvel movie,I thought Black Widow was downright mediocre while I was sitting there watching it. Weird flick. Shang Chi was great though. What a ride.
