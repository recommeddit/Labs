7681,"Just broke my laptop so I'm in the market for a replacement- the screen broke because slept on it accidentally. Also the hinges were falling apart, so a good build would be important (It'll spend most of it's life on my bed). Battery doesn't have to be the best. I would use it for general internet browsing, streaming videos, and reading (I usually have a lot of tabs open) though I also do some light gaming (Minecraft, terraria, stardew valley, and some browser games). My budget is around $600-$800 though I can go a bit higher. Any recommendations? (Other than not sleeping with my laptop next to me)",best laptop for general use

70731,"It never worked for me, partly because I didn't believe they wouldn't realise the dead body wasn't dead over so many hours. Also because the way the black guy (Zep?) was menacing the wife and child with a gun went beyond anything he was forced to do, so the film was a bait and switch for me.

I preferred the later films. For example, Saw II:  >!the footage we thought was live was actually recorded days earlier!<.",best movies with a cool twist
