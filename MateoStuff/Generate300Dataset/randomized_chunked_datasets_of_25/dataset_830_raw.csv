I'm taking my Dad to a local museum neither of us have ever been to.  It's about an industry a late relative spent his career in and that we both find interesting.  Then we're going for lunch at our favourite hot dog restaurant.  Should be lots of fun for both of us.
"although I agree, I found Adguard was better at blocking Facebook ads. And sites often detect uBlock, in my experience."
Whisky. She actually likes it. Last year a day at the spa for pampering.
"On the other hand... Linux Mint Cinnamon is beautiful. It's very easy to use. And is generally great for beginners. 

That said, bring on the downvotes!"
"I cannot recommend node-fetch. We got bitten by this bug:

[https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/533](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/533)

&#x200B;

We did use the suggested alternative, but it's just plain odd that you can only call an output function a single time only. I get that this is a function of the underlying impl being a stream, but from a ux perspective, it's poor.

&#x200B;

We're actually moving away from node-fetch because we'd rather not have to deal with such situations. We've decided to go with request/promise because it's been very battle-tested and you can have reasonable expectations about how it works."
Yes you can. It’s worth every penny.
The eyes?
Had this done.. Sadist of a dentist held a mirror in front of my face to show me what i had done mid-surgery and while i was a little loopy from the opiates it still burned an image in my mind. Never went back to that guy....
Wtf is it with you and Hulu?
"The second idea is amazing, not joking. This is the future."
Nestle because not only are they assholes but they poison my water
My all time favourite energy drink is gonna have to be the original Monster. But I do like other energy drinks as well
You should never open GUI programs with elevated privileges.
I feel like $CRM is not mentioned enough in these “your top 5 for the next 10 years” discussions. It’s an absolute monster.
">Read a few, preferably at opposite ends of the spectrum. 

Two wrongs don't make a right."
"For folks that found Primer a bit too heady, Time Crimes is a wonderful suggestion.  Subtitled, but totally worth it."
"I'm glad there's more people who have read this awesome book. It's really eyeopening and makes you aware of this concept of willpower that you thought you knew, but really didn't."

No I only used it in a cell phone sorry
Are they still around?
"I wonder if Cedar Fair decided that trying to compete in that area with Hersheypark and Great Adventure wasn't worth it once they bought the Paramount Parks. And at that point they just kind of left Dorney to wither on the vine.

I hope not. We may see some unexpected closures and relocations as a result of the pandemic if it continues much longer so who knows how things will end up. You guys are certainly past due for some new coasters though."
"Wild Adventures? We know it exists, we just pretend that it doesn’t."
You suck at cooking is great!
"I can't say enough good things about this book! I converted a new English speaker to a book lover with this book. It really is magical.

In all fairness, the only other book she'd ever finished or read was Le Mis, and she thought she hated ALL books because of how rough that was."
"You're young.  Plan a trip based off of the things you like and live it up.  Save the all inclusive packages for the retired folks.  With the money you save on commission and overpriced food, you can get a much better bang for your buck.

That aside, there is no shortage of all inclusive resorts on islands surrounding wherever it is you are from.  If you happen to be from America: Belize, Puerto Rico (Culebra), and Mexico come to mind as particularly affordable areas that have 'resorts'.  Of course there is always Florida, S. Carolina, California, etc if you don't have a passport."
