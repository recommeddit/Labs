45013,"The amazon kindle has changed my life. It allows me to read in the complete darkness of my bed and is lighter in weight than any mass market paperback and certainly thinner. The current models all feature a dimmable backlight. Combined with the e-ink display that is easy for the eyes makes it possible for me to read LOTR right now with our baby sleeping in her crib in the same room while the lights are off. They can also be purchased for around $50 for a certified refurbished or $90 for a brand new one. I also recommend the kindle unlimited subscription that has thousands of books included if you read alot of books each month, it's $10 a month (and a new kindle comes with 3 months free).",best items under $100
