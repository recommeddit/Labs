65084,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Barbareno is still solid.
62661,Best RPG game on PS4,Curious what mods you think are necessary for Skyrim. Starting a new playthrough soon
68835,best science fiction novel,The description makes it sound a lot like The Dispossessed
17298,best iOS game,Exiled Kingdoms. One of my top 3 of all time.
45562,best gaming system,"The 360 was a beast, so many great games, so easy to use.

Guy's gonna have a blast!

360 is nothing to be ashamed of. Just like getting a PS4 in 10 years to play ""all the classics"" will still be super cool."
43159,best detective show,"Broadchurch is one my favourite crime tv show, it’s just so consistent and well written, wish I could just forget it and watch it again"
12075,best gifts for dad,You forgot to leave cash on the dresser.
27914,best breakfast foods,How would you make that? Just stick a waffle in the blender with the smoothie?
42476,movies like Inception,Westworld is definitely a show to fully dive into. Many story lines and clues but the show is a wild ride! Season One is especially excellent.
55814,best action and adventure movie,"I really dont know but i watch the boss level yesterday, with frank grillo, i enjoyed the hell out of it"
4283,best text editor,Because he's asking for a Windows text editor and we all know Windows is the OS Hitler would build if he was in CS?
45013,best items under $100,"The amazon kindle has changed my life. It allows me to read in the complete darkness of my bed and is lighter in weight than any mass market paperback and certainly thinner. The current models all feature a dimmable backlight. Combined with the e-ink display that is easy for the eyes makes it possible for me to read LOTR right now with our baby sleeping in her crib in the same room while the lights are off. They can also be purchased for around $50 for a certified refurbished or $90 for a brand new one. I also recommend the kindle unlimited subscription that has thousands of books included if you read alot of books each month, it's $10 a month (and a new kindle comes with 3 months free)."
17707,best iOS game,It's an older RPG but Book of Heroes is the best mobile game I've played.
2289,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Damn, I think the ES one is damned good, so if that one is not great by comparison, the District location must be amazing. Too bad for me I have so little reason to drive so far the fuck into the sprawl, but if I ever do, I'll try and hit up that one."
5297,best home improvement store,Second CB2! I’ve gotten many decor items and some great barstools from them. I didn’t know it existed before I bought this house and it’s my favorite store now. It’s the more modern brand owned by Crate and Barrel. Sort of what West Elm is to Pottery Barn.
22516,best celebrity,I met Chris Hemsworth at a convention in Australia. Our only interaction was him apologising to me for a mother’s rudeness as she shoved me out of the way because her child meeting Chris was more important
2493,best headphones,"They're incredibly cheap, and they sound bloody amazing. I have two different ones, the HD 669 (closed) which sound almost just as good as my old AKG K240's, and I have HD 681F (semi-open) that also sound really good (not as good as the HD 669).

Every person I've lured into buying them were floored by the price/performace factor.

At around/under €30 they are unbeatable."
64016,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,Bookaudiobook.com
34912,best NFL player,he’s on the bengals defense that’s why

24994,best spiderman actor,"This. If it weren't for Spider-Tobey and the X-Men, we wouldn't have most of the comic book movies now outside of Batman. It was also the later Joe Schumacher Batman films that almost killed the comic book movies."
72464,best keyboard switches,Tealios!!!
21791,best winnie the pooh comic,This made me feel very uncomfortable
