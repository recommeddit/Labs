"Absolutely. Sadly he doesn't have a ton of content, and posts very rarely. Then again, to get to a level of memery of science that he has, it must take a whole long time."
"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/09/economist-explains-itself-0

That's The Economist's statement of their ideology, so to speak. It definitely has clear political opinions, but insofar as classical liberalism straddles both the standard left/right divide in the west, they are centered. You'll get a clearer picture from the linked article."
"Make a small hole on the small end. Make a larger hole on the large end. Blow hard through the small hole, the egg will come out intact out of the larger hole. You can peel hard boiled eggs like this in less than  10 seconds."
Toblerones.
I love any and all fruity cocktail drinks but Pina Colada's are my favorite.
Repeating the same logic for each time you use fetch doesn’t seem like a good alternative though.
"It's meant to be live distro you run from USB when needed for job, not something you install as daily driver."
Certainly feels like it.
"I know you're looking for something specific, but Libby (an app that let's you browse/borrow audiobooks through your local library's catalog) is actually pretty impressive for the value it offers.

Forgive me for sounding like a paid spokesperson, but I'm actually just a pleasantly surprised consumer.

I know, I know -- it's not perfect. Some hot new titles have incredibly long waiting lists, and I guess if your library sucks then this will too since they're one in the same. 

But I've found it's extremely useful for getting my hands on an audiobook that isn't in extremely high demand right this second (World War Z, The Stand, My Year of Rest and Relaxation, etc).

For that, I think it's worth mentioning if you didn't know of its existence already. I didn't until very recently."
Holy moly that sounds good

Oh that looks promising, thanks."
"Haven't seen anyone mention this, so I'll add my tip.

Get a [NeilMed sinus rinse bottle](http://be8c5029833240ca9038-8a2c38c8946b4d497918152d3d6bf41f.r27.cf1.rackcdn.com/Sinus-rinse-Ad.jpg) and use it twice a day. This was actually prescribed to me by a doctor because I was getting frequent sinus infections. Not only did it knock those out in a few days (when it typically took me 2-3 weeks to fully recover from them naturally), it also has kept me from developing colds when I first feel the symptoms, or drastically shortened them."
Half an hour a day is 3.5 hours a week and 40 hours a week is more than 11 times more than than that.
"That's really cool, and I hope I'm wrong about Adobe.

I still wouldn't want to recommend it to someone who needs Adobe to be reliable."
"Off topic a bit, but on the topic of integrated microphones and audio quality on phones. 

Something that has been bothering me for a while now is radio commercials or radio shows that have a caller on the line or a recorded call that they play back. Why does every single one of those sound like it was recorded off of a landline from 1960? Its always this horrific quality that you can barely understand. No phone sounds like that anymore. So why does the audio on these radio shows or commercials sound so terrible? Are they running it through a filter to “make it sound like someone is on the phone”? I know it’s not cause they don’t have good audio equipment, because all the hosts of the show or the main person in the commercial are crystal clear and are very clearly using professional audio equipment. My phone doesn’t sound like that when I’m making calls, so why does EVERY radio show or commercial with callers have callers that sound terrible."
Howl o scream is a lot better than HHN if you want scary just saying
"Sean Astin. Met him in the summer of 2003, so after The Two Towers and before Return of the King.

He seemed to be a genuinely humble, kind man who appreciates the success he's had, his fans, and just life in general.

Also nice (in a quiet, scholarly kind of way) : Brad Dourif, who has played Grima Wyrmtongue, Chucky, and a lot of mad scientists and creepy villains. He also once guest starred in Babylon Five, and gave an incredible performance."
"I /really/ like electric blankets. It's so much more efficient than heating your whole room up.

I like just keep it spread out on the bed, lay on top of it, and put another blanket over me. It's super comfy this way, I think. Heat rises up through you and gets trapped by the other blanket.

No power grid connection at my house, and in the winter if we run out of propane, an electric blanket is a life saver since it lets you sleep comfortably even if the house is cold, in exchange for very little electricity, which the solar power system easily supplies even in winter."
Hatebreed.  Namely the perseverance album.
"Yup, the “English tax” will still be there if a club from England tries to bring him back in the future"
"Oh, mine's never drawn blood, she doesn't have teeth, I didn't think it was possible. But she's never hung on or anything, just jabbed at me sometimes in a feeding frenzy. 

The heat requirements are easy, too. Long as the room isn't too hot and there isn't direct sun making the tank into a greenhouse, you just need to slap an under-tank heater on one end of the tank and you're good. 

I find it pretty easy! The crickets are a bit inconvenient though you're right."
