"OP I love how humble you are! Never be sorry for that! It maybe old but its yours and you worked hard for it. The fact you're proud and wanted to show that in a world where people on the Internet can be really hurtful. Well let's just say I love your character! 


Everyone's recommended so many brilliant games im sure you have a list! For me it would be resident evil 5. Not because its the best game about or even in the series. But for me it marked a time in my early 20s where me and mt friends had the laid back attitude, we would all go to one another houses, drink beer, eat crappy takeaway and just have fun. We've all grown up and got out own lives now, but that summer when it came out.. was a damn good summer!"

I think it is Rice but how exactly is Montana more important than Brady to the sport? Because he played before Brady is the reason why?

Ok appreciate it last question does tweak compatible work with sileo?
"Great update, thanks for doing.  FYI US Mobile just upped its plans to 1, 5, 12, 18, 30 GB."

"Define useful.

Useful for the human race: medicine, theoretical physics, aerospace engineering.

Useful for your financial situation: CS, IT, programming, finance, law

Useful for sociability and personal interest: music, art, language, history

Useful for the good of others: education, hospitality, nursing

Your college president is not a fuck-cunt, they wouldn't keep a program running using school funding without having it on good factual authority that the course serves some useful purpose in some way for some people.

That is the beauty of market economy. If it exists, there's a demand for it making it useful somewhere."
"1. You are welcome! I'm glad you found it helpful. I realized that was the way I liked to find & compare plans, so I figured other people may like it, too. 

2. I think you're thinking of OnlyFans? Either way, yeah, my Patron is basically behind the scenes of videos, ad-free podcast episodes, and a cool community on Discord."
"I love you right now! So tired of people judging other people decisions and options.

Mate, do what you want on your real free time and let others do what they want with theirs.

OP is asking for advice on a resort not to be convinced about changing his holidays to go hiking the Annapurna..."
I’m really surprised I had to scroll this far to find electric bass. It has a reputation for being the instrument you stick your friend who knows nothing about music on because most pop music is really simple on bass.
Literally this! Kourtney can be annoying or superficial but she’s never done anything wildly controversial.
Thanks for the info!
don't know why it's not working for me just crashes
"lol ok hear me out

The Marriott in Baltimore. The one right on the water. 

I grew up...well, we weren't quite poor, but we were one overdraft fee away from screwed thanks to my mom's credit card issues, so this is bar far the nicest hotel I've ever seen. 

It was so cool - room service is real! So are bellhops and wine in the attached restaurant and weddings walked by on their way to ballrooms and there were double digit floors numbers starting with a three!

It basically blew my mind. My husband still likes to think about it jut because it was so, so new to me and my reactions were apparently priceless lol"
Debatable mate :P
Hey! That's my line!

"first i must say this is my second hopping on voidlinux and i'm 90% certain that i won't leave it. after my first use for around 5-6 months i hopped again to debian and arch, used arch for a while but got tired of it. i am on my second run with void and this is where i ended up after my 1.5 years of linux journey.

for once, it ships with runit, a snappy and resource efficient init system. \*\*this was not the main selling point for me\*\* as i didn't know much about init systems back then but as i use it more i see it is better in some ways compared to systemd. it is simple and it really is just an init system, does whatever it promises only. it is still easy to manage and audit services too. boot time is like \~10 sec after bios sequence ends on my 12-yo craptop. (i don't want to discuss the ""philosophy"" behind runit so i won't answer a question regarding that, cuz i don't care about it :D i'd still use systemd if i need, i love runit, though it is not a big deal)

i love rolling release. you just keep up to date and that's it. no hassling with point upgrades and stuff (i know it is not totally ideal for server side but you get the point). the thing is, \*void promises reliability while being up to date.\* it does not drop packages as soon as they arrive like arch, but it doesn't stay late too long. very upstream, not bleeding edge, rolling and reliable packages. package auditing is pretty good in my experience. (remark: stable does not mean reliable, void isn't stable as it is a rolling release, but it is reliable and sturdy. two concepts that many confuse.) \*\*updating your packages and system is still in your responsibility, no one can promise ""no breakage"". use at your own risk.\*\* luckily i never had a breakage. even when i installed with 2019 isos in 2020, after a system update it worked just fine. thus, you don't see an ISO update every now and then like arch. is simply isn't necessary all the time.

xbps package manager, it is more robust than pacman for example, as it doesn't just yeet or slam packages without auditing, xbps takes more responsibility to keep system from breaking. that means you can do partial updates. (this section might be controversial so i am sorry about it in advance.)

[xbps-src source packages collection.](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages) some packages that can't be [redistributed](https://docs.voidlinux.org/xbps/repositories/restricted.html) can be installed from source using xbps-src. it is like aur, but carefully audited by developers, not users and that doesn't allow any out of date or orphaned packages. also it is cleaner, you just pull a folder from github and all compilation happens in that folder. it doesn't mess with your host system environment.

[variety of architectures.](https://voidlinux.org/download/) you can install it on x86 (both 32 and 64 bit) and many arm platforms, including rpi.

variety of software. you have bunch of native packages, xbps-src and flatpak support.

void is pretty light and barebones if you use base image to install. base iso contains only \~120 packages and you also have desktop options too with xfce, cinnamon and so on. installation takes no time at all, there is an ncurses installer that goes straightforward and it handles system configuration really well. (especially desktop isos are installed in 2-3 minutes as you install local packages from iso. base package needs network connection.)

musl is also an option if you don't want to use glibc or gnu coreutils. it gets even lighter with musl. 

you can check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/mjvxax/void_compared_to_other_distros/) to see a comparison between arch and void, it gives an idea.
