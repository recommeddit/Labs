"So if I were to use mouthwash and floss, but brush with a sonic toothbrush and water I'd probably get the same (if not better) results than with brushing with toothpaste alone? Do people just expect that toothpaste is required because we've always been told to have it?"
I can offer you boobies and that's about it.

"learn the one you like the most, and you will still probably drop it. you're 21 already. mastering an instrument takes years."
It’s the name of a book that’s both a fantastic introduction and free online.  And don’t worry about the questions!  You’re brand new to this.

"Because phone makers one of the main concern is camera. So they spend too much r&d to camera. But computer company’s main concern is price or performance. Phones sell much more with “the best camera in the world” like advertising but computers do not. 

And there is image sensor processor and ai that runs behind a phone camera. But that is either too expensive for computers or they have to ıse an arm processor rather than x86. 

And there is thickness problem, the phone is thin but laptop screen is thinner so they can squeeze only so much lens that it will suck for an eternity. There will be no webcam that matches a good phone camera or dslr ever (except that using a dslr for webcam). 

So if you want good quality for webcam just buy a camera that supports external display and use a capture card and obs virtual cam.

External webcam market is a small market because most people just use their laptop webcams or their phone as webcam and streamers use a dslr cam for webcam. So they do not sell. So they do not spend as much r&d as other camera markets. So they suck and they will continue to suck."

i think this is pretty universal reaction. i know a person who runs a vegan restaurant and he's often hit by requests to get free food from 'reviewers' and 'social media influencers'. most of them also turn pretty vile when denied and react with threats of smear-campaigning the place etc.

"I bought a ASUS VH242H (1920x1080@60Hz) about 6 years ago for about 150$. It still runs great, and it has a HDMI input.

Maybe you can check out the used (or refurbished) market for one of those."

"Hilton quality varies wildly, and doesn't seem to correlate with price. The cheapest Hilton I've been in has been really nice, and the most expensive was the shittiest hotel I've ever been in."
