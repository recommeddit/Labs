That's just not true. Not anymore. As of last year, what Allen never does is give up on a third down. He'll slide or go out of bounds if it's first or second down. 

But look at the play where he stiff-armed Van Noy, then broke out of Ogbah's tackle? That was a 3rd and 8. And he *never* wants to concede a punt. The plays where he's scrambling all over the place, breaking tackles, trying to run for a first down or thread impossible passes on the scramble drill? Almost all of them are on 3rd down.",best NFL player
