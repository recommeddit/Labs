4975,best home improvement store,It's more helpful to Google the item and the store that you are at and find the isle and bay location listed with the item as opposed to asking someone

3099,best webcamera,"Not really considering how big of a difference even a selfie camera is over a webcam. The bigger issue is price and consumers caring enough, and also marketing because it's hard to convey to consumers image quality compared to other specs."
12581,best gifts for mom,SO-SO
10645,best suitcase lock,I use one of those cheap ass “diary” padlocks (or sometimes a string) just to make sure the zipper doesn’t open  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
13567,best research paper archive,Great link!!
51932,best iphone case,"I think it is. Idk about last year but I had an 11 Pro and the leather was nice on that case. I just picked up a 13 Pro case and it just seems very thin compared to the 11. Not the case, but the leather. It was a little disappointing considering the cost and how well made the 11 case was"
44859,best items under $100,"If it wasn't for the fact that I know my mum doesn't have reddit, I'd say this was her lol. Except she likes Asics sneakers. And has a ""slipper crocs (croc with lambs wool lining, a crocasin if you will), yard crocs and going out crocs"" and she has converted me too. 

My fiancee likes to pretend I end at the knees, then she doesn't have to look at my camouflage crocs."
35663,best alcoholic drink,I'm allergic to whiskey. It makes my knuckles bleed.
34829,best NFL player,"> he never fucking slides

That's just not true. Not anymore. As of last year, what Allen never does is give up on a third down. He'll slide or go out of bounds if it's first or second down. 

But look at the play where he stiff-armed Van Noy, then broke out of Ogbah's tackle? That was a 3rd and 8. And he *never* wants to concede a punt. The plays where he's scrambling all over the place, breaking tackles, trying to run for a first down or thread impossible passes on the scramble drill? Almost all of them are on 3rd down."

Also love re-experiencing DanganRonpa as well"
28990,best breakfast foods,That sounds really good. Any pasta/ seafood salad recommendations that avoid creamy dressing?
42238,movies like Inception,"Coherence

It's a pretty under the radar gem and I saw it mentioned on Reddit before. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time watching it. Basically, a group of friends are having a dinner party the night of a meteor shower and weird things start happening."
68463,best science fiction novel,That's the right page. The Sci-Fi is further down the page.
68170,best science fiction novel,"I never thought of it like that, but you are right. The corporation-as-government aspect is a huge part of cyberpunk and this novel lays that out nicely. One of my favorite scenes is when the government agent is led through a labyrinth to finally meet with the CEO/patriarch and then jaunts out of the place as a way to say ""I know where you live."""
14507,best romantic novel,"I finished The Wall of Winnipeg and Me yesterday in one day (like 3 interrupted reading sessions) and it was SO FREAKING GOOD. I am grateful to everyone who recommended it over and over on this sub. I'm probably reading Kulti next, or Red White and Royal Blue."
40382,best midrange GPU,For the whole build or just gpu

19905,best workout music,I don't listen to hip hop so I cannot give you any suggestions but if you are going to be doing calisthenics in a public gym I can tell you that nothing makes working out more unpleasant  and uncomfortable than being in a gym filled with young white folk listening to music containing nigger this and nigger that throughout every song.
73662,best battery bank,"Huawei 12000mah supercharge, 40 watt input. 7.8 oz. got mine last week and still running tests with. Its charging at 27watt with the 30watt charger I have.

69264,best major to study in college,High finance cares more about school than degree. Accounting isn't going to get you into banking. Finance is crap shoot unless you are at a target.
