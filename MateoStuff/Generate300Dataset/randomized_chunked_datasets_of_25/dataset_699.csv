63454,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Pretty cool. Nice of you.
20231,best workout music,the only list I'll ever remember in my entire life
55945,best action and adventure movie,I feel like now more than ever the world needs a National Treasure 3
61742,Best RPG game on PS4,Thinking about getting Persona 5 too. Is it recommendable even for someone who isn't too much into animes and that sort of stuff?
70656,best movies with a cool twist,"Did the movie really have a plot twist though? From what I remember, it just went really really off the rails in a huge ""wtf"" way for the entire last act lol"
35526,best alcoholic drink,"WHAT. Shut your face, really?"
31265,best country to live in,"To have ""fun"" all I need is a PC and internet access"
13351,best spreadsheet editor,"I mentioned my big ones: options for default number format handling, and allowing VBA to work with the undo stack. I would also want a much better implementation for event handling in VBA, asynchronous stuff in VBA, multithreaded VBA...Also, for ontime calls not to break if excel is in edit mode or the user opens/closes a file, etc.

Macro source being an object, not a string (application.caller).

A GUI ribbon XML editor would be great. More flexible options for it too (not everything the native ribbon has is available to user-defined ones).

Compatibility patches for old versions so I don't have to worry about formulas not working on a file I send out.

Being able to specify number of worksheets in a workbook created in VBA. (I have to run loops every time to delete excess sheets that might be present.)

Having worksheet.copy return a worksheet object (it's insane that it doesn't!).

Being able to copy workbook theme to a new workbook object so it doesn't just have the application default. This can be done now, and I do it, but it's *extremely* awkward and involves saving and loading a temporary theme file from disk!

Etc., etc. That's just what I can think of off the top of my head.

Edit: more reliable repaint functions would be good too, for cases where application.screenupdating = false.

Edit 2: having min and max functions in VBA outside of workbookfunction; they could just be aliases but goddamn that's awkward for a basic programming function.

Edit 3: having the VBE not default to showing a form object if present instead of whatever code module I was actually working in."

44735,best items under $100,"A lot of my favorite purchases were already mentioned but I think it's still worth it to drill the point

* Bidet attachment
* Electric toothbrush
* 10 ft USB Type C cable
* Used headphones on kijiji (got Astro A40 and Audio Technica's)
* Bought a Blue Yeti and Stand off Kijiji for $100"
33377,best electric car,Yep! I got $7.5k off with federal incentive + saved $4k in taxes with state incentives.
23713,best car racing video game,"Such a good game. Used to love the purple car, think it was called the Razor or something to that effect. Top Gear Rally/Overdrive were great too, although the original SNES one was still the best."
17956,best Kardashian,"right now

58034,best cologne,"This one! I've received so many compliments from both girls *and* guys, and quite a few have even asked me what it was so they can get it for themselves or their SO. I've been using Bleu de Chanel EDP recently since I found it lasts longer which is perfect for when working at the office, but I might buy another bottle of L'Homme by YSL EDT for dates and hangouts."
68785,best science fiction novel,"Partway through player of games right now.  :-)  

In the spirit of reciprocity, check out Vinge's ""A Fire Upon the Deep"" and Bujold's Vorkosigan novels if you haven't already."
5789,best programming language for web development,for the love of god not PHP.
30033,best money managing app,Money Lover
20456,best workout music,"Depends, most of the time I have a rap playing but if I need to get through a workout or it’s a max effort day Children of Bodom, Megadeth, and Parkway Drive is blasting"
6128,best Netflix documentary,I just looked them up and unfortunately none of them are on. Apparently all the Ken Burns documentaries have left Netflix in the US. One user mentioned that The Vietnam is on Amazon Prime but I don’t have Prime so I’m not sure if that’s true.
25670,best cricket teams of all time,"As for fast bowling, surely having Lee in there was exciting as well? In fact, having Lee, Gillespie and McGrath was awesome. Along with Bichel and Kasporwicz backing up here and there. We were very fortunate to have that depth."
8661,best toothpaste,"Invest in an electric toothbrush—Oral B or Sonicare are the best quality ones and floss (properly) daily.   No rinse, toothpaste or fancy product will do you any good if you aren’t mechanically and thoroughly removing the plaque and bacteria from your teeth regularly.  I have patients who don’t use toothpaste at all who have healthy mouths because they are meticulous brushes and flossers.  
Think of when your car is really grimy and it rains.  Does your car get clean?  No.  You have to mechanically remove the grime.  Same with your teeth."
3610,best college for research,"Good on you for being open to other majors and realizing that rankings aren't everything :)

Unigo and Niche have great sections that are ""student reviews"" of the college. I liked reading them to get a sense of what it was like to be on campus. **Definitely** check these out.

Similarly, admissions blogs are very helpful for this--MIT was the pioneer for these and IMO, have the best ones :P http://mitadmissions.org/blogs

College Scorecard is a great place to get baseline info about a college. Same with eh Common Data Sheets.

College Websites! Bruh, literally just going onto the college website and looking at their mission statement, the criteria that they like to apply when selecting students, what they look for, etc., really helped me understand what kind of students are going to be at that schools :P

USNWR, but SOLELY to help me find colleges to research. I basically just looked up top 100 schools at ____, read through the list, noted down the ones that I was remotely interested in, and then just kept narrowing it down by doing more and more research. I agree with you--these ranking basically mean jack shit for undergrad, especially if you want high teaching quality. But, they're a good place to *Start*, but not beyond that. If you're intersted in multiple majors and have any idea about which other ones you might be interested in, see if there's overlap between these rankings for those majors :P

And finally, weirdly, their meme pages. They give you a very interesting insight into the personality of the students."
71949,best movies with a cool twist,"I also loved this movie because of its clean, modern aesthetic contrasted with the Norwegian landscape. Very pleasing to my eyeballs"
45626,best gaming system,"Good news: you did great.

Bad news is: it doesn't end there. now you have to work to pay for the games, the Xbox live, the extras like a headset/bigger hard drive.

But better for that than for drugs huh?!

How old are you BTW and what you ve been working?"
