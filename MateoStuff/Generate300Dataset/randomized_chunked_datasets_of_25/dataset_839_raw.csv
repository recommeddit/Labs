Both of those are good shoes. The Zoom x Invincible coming out soon are supposed to be pretty good as well and pretty similar.
"People using RedHat probably now where to look to solve their problems, so they don't necessarily show up in such rankings, imo."
"Barry Sanders, even though he never won a ring"
"Likewise, but since Brita themselves clearly state in their manuals that their filters do not make water SAFE, I figured I didn't want to deal with someone dumping diesel in the neighborhood and just went with a big old jug of water from the store."
its most similar to Grid 2019 i would say. not near as bad as NFS.
Scoop it out and spread it with a fork.... it's fairly intuitive.... (you can get all fancy with slices as well if you want but it's easier to eat if you mush it up a bit)
"I guess it depends on what you're sending, I get the sentiment but my thought is always ""yeah motherfucker I was up at 2:30 AM fixing shit for you, sorry if I misspelled a word but let me repeat that I was doing work in the middle of the night for your lazy ass"".  I don't think I've ever wanted to send an email later, you'll take my email you lazy sleeping piece of shit."
I was like .. shit..Shit!!! SHIT!!!!
"1. Nier Automata

3. The Witcher 3

"Iâ€™m always down to hear your cool Spanish/Portuguese stuff cause that Monsieur PerinÃ© was phenomenal.  Paloma smooth as glass off this one song, & Iâ€™m on Goteo rn & Jesus this beat is it, dig.

I always forget how massive the Latin music world is & just itâ€™s entire own thing."
"Just want to point out that Sephora carries men's fragrances and they will give you little samples to take home with you if you ask. Last time I was there I walked out with 4 Tom Ford samples. They just spray from the tester into small little spray vials. The Bloomingdale's near me was very pushy and would not give my anything to take home, so this was a blessing."
"I did not, but I totally should have because the first pair I ordered was *way* too big, but their returns and exchanges are so easy!"
"Milky way

Caramel, nougat, chocolate, no nuts just perfection.  In our neighborhood we rarely get more than a dozen or so kids, so we buy a box of like 24 candy bars from Costco and call it good.  Before we moved here we used to go through five bags of candy and still run out before the night was over, so were happy to not be dealing with that anymore!"
Isnâ€™t toothpaste abrasive anyways? Whatâ€™s the difference if you use baking soda or a high whitening toothpaste? I could be mistaken about how toothpaste actually works

"> More and more the browser is becoming sort of like a thin-client for cloud services

You are completely right about JavaScript, although the browser was never a thin client and is only getting more complex, not less. Thin clients are simple pieces of software and browsers have never been simple."
"OP seems to be willing to learn, and its not like the distro is actively trying to prevent you from learning"
"If they like mystery AND romance, definitely Sebastian St. Cyr mysteries. It's a series, by C.S. Harris, who is also a romance novelist, and it shows. The mysteries are engaging and well thought-out (with the exception of the latest book, I think), and the romance plots I found to be satisfying."
"I was gonna say Tayto Park, but instead I say Energylandia. Tayto Park is starting to grow, but veeeerrrryyy slowly."
"The Spanish American War was pretty ridiculous. TR got his fame there being a ""Rough Rider"" and fucking up everything in Cuba. Really interesting time in history that no one ever talks about. Did you know a crazy American guy started a cult or movement of sorts in Nicaragua and tried to annex it into the US? I think that's how the story went at least it's been a while since I was in class"
"THIS. Aquafina tastes like metal, chlorine, and wet dog. ICK!"
"Awesome review dude. Totally agree on those I've tried. But what's your main? Air 58? GPW? XM1?

Either you have a main or you don't and you just use them when you feel like it. lol"
What up with the Cruel Summer hate? That album was great..tf some of his best songs are on there.
