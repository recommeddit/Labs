"Activated carbon works by adsorption (adhering of molecules to a surface.) Eventually most of the surface area will be covered with the molecules you're trying to filter out, and so you need to replace the filter."
I really like the sinnoh games and you should try out platinum
"I have a hard time saying that Aaron Donald isn't the best player in the NFL, and the most valuable if you adjust for positional values.  Do I think Mahomes makes a bigger impact on a game?  Yes, but he is a QB.  Every QB should make a bigger impact than a DT in the overall outcome of the game...  But, I just don't see anyone nearly as value for their position in the NFL as Aaron Donald.  The guy does the job of both a DE and a DT on the same play, all while facing double teams.  If Donald goes down for an injury, I think the Rams D fall to the middle of the pack, if not worse."
"Love Altered Carbon and and Dune. The TV series of AC left me really unimpressed though. 

Got to admit that I got about a third of the way through Anathem and put it down to read another book and then just haven’t gone back to it in a couple of years. The maths was hard."
"Hell yeah Bro, shoutout to Poochie's uncle."
"Probably depends on the season. Summer humidity can be a pain on the east coast.

In general, I'd guess Miami, NYC, Boston, and DC."
"Mmm my bf wears this, I agree!!!"
">You'll love the hotel when you get back to it.

Or maybe he won't, and he'll become [Christopher McCandless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_mccandless)."
"Oregon decriminalized it, if I’m not mistaken."
Agriculture. There will always be a need for a better method to produce more food for a growing population.
"I got the gshock mudman for like $75.

No regrets.  Great watch and money well spent"
The beauty is in their simplicity.

"Probably the best to travel and see. If you are having trouble making life long friends among people you have been around with decades then it may be very unlikely you would be able to make those friends in a different country. I have seen many somewhat lonely people try to start anew somewhere else in the world because they can't relate to the United States but have even more trouble being on their own in a new country.

That being said, if you have spent considerable time over in a new country and have had great success then go for it."
They might as well print pictures out of Playboy or Hustler. Exceedingly unprofessional.
When is the Shrek 2 sherbet going to come back? The one with the pop rocks. That was the best.
"How do you pay for the hotel?  In other words, normally if you're staying at a hotel for three nights, you check in, give a credit card, and check out three days later.  I'm assuming in your case, they don't just wait until you're gone (a year) before charging you for your stay.  So how does it work?"
"This ranking isn't based on actual trophy amounts or anything, just fan votes from this subreddit."
"Utopia?





Sorry, I just had to..."
"Ultra late reply, but audiobookcup.com appears to be working with 9xbuddy again. Audiobookx is still busted, though."
"Richard K. Morgan's [Altered Carbon](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40445.Altered_Carbon) seemed pretty action-packed to me. It literally starts with a bang, and doesn't let up a whole lot most of the way through."
"I think you're probably confusing this ranking with the Pro Bowl voting, that does close out in November."
"> most of the recent papers are freely available to the public through Pubmed after certain amount of time has passed

Depending on the field, of course."
"I'll second Adam Curtis, we need social critique now more than ever. He's like a modern Christopher Lasch. You can find his latest on Youtube"
"Soylent green was way ahead of its time considering the plot twist! Citizen Kane was also similar, such a creative twist, and the feeling that they never found out *SPOILER: that Rosebud was his childhood sled, but we, the viewers got to know it was so smart SPOILER*"
