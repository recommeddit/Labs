23700,best car racing video game,"Same here, other Sims have their good points but for me iRacing is all i need. The new Porsche 911 GT3 cup is fantastic and an absolute blast to race, and no other racing game comes close to iRacings online setup imo."
56874,best water brand,I swear it is the Fiji water that is SO overpriced but is SO good
12464,best gifts for mom,Last year I got my Mum tickets to go see a comedian she really liked. I hadn't given her any hint I was doing it so she was totally surprised when she saw the tickets. She didn't even know he was coming to our city either which made it even better.
32236,best hotel to live in,Think of the Southwest points they’re missing out on!!
41700,movies like Inception,"Pontypool. It’s not exactly like inception, but is an incredibly under-seen movie that people on this thread would enjoy. Mess with your head, great concept, great acting, so much fun."
16232,best sunglasses for fashion,"I actually buy off of e-bay, usually used. Bought both Julbo and Tico Sol, with the leather side shields, didn't pay more than 25 bucks CDN for either, with shipping and tax usually less than 50 bucks. 

Here's a link to a new set of Julbo's of the same style.

Just have to shop around."
31744,best hotel to live in,"There actually are alternate service dogs for stress and such, which are universally small lap-dog type breeds.  How much is hype by the patients I don't know, but this is a real thing.  I know of one MS patient who has one."
56491,best desktop monitor,"48C1, anyone?"
11266,best gifts for dad,What about ties and underwear?
10295,best suitcase lock,**Warning!**: This is a trap. With two handles the baggage handlers can throw your baggage farther away and risk even more damage!
53346,best usb c charging cable,"Many cables are charging focused (USB 2.0, low bandwidth). It’s also why Apple’s own Thunderbolt 3/4 cables cost a helluva lot more than the standard USB-C charging cable."
21905,best winnie the pooh comic,man i wanna group that poohs tits
59944,best perfume,"Agree with the others about Pacifica. 

Mix Bar at Target has some good ones. 

Good Chemistry North Sky 

B&BW In the Stars

Outremer Vanille and Ocean are great, excellent performance. I want to try Bergamot too. 

Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and the flankers. Especially Green Tea and Fig 

Perfumer’s Workshop Tea Rose 

Zara Cardamom and A Mochi Atelier in Tokyo 

I’m curious about the Urban Outfitters perfumes, though I think performance might vary among the line based on my testing. Pistachio sounds amazing but my nose can’t find it when I spray."
3947,best online college,What in the fuck? An online law degree? Can you even take the bar with that?
69601,best major to study in college,Fuckin love this emote
68087,best science fiction novel,It's one of the weaker novels but I didn't hate it.
27507,best bollywood actor,"Yes, he may not be a great actor but he puts a lot of hard work into his roles...."
7872,best laptop for general use,Great points. Could you provide me links or suggested sites for the Acer Swift 3 and the Asus Zenbook 14 with the recommended specs? Thank you!
30797,best country to live in,"Dude, geysers!"
67910,best science fiction novel,"So glad to see Hyperion Cantos on this list. 

There are many fine offerings, but of my personal recommendations to friends, that's usually the one they've never heard of, years after we've discussed OSC, Douglas Adams, Heinlein etc. ad nauseum."
5189,best home improvement store,"I frequent both. 

* I have the credit cards for both. Lowes give you a blanket 5% off with the credit card. That's pretty good. So if there's similar goods for the same price, I'll go do Lowes. A lot of what I buy are essentially commodity goods (lumber, drywall, concrete) so I don't care where I buy it--just what price I pay.
* Home Depot does 1 year no-questions-asked returns on most everything with the credit card. And your ""if you  don't have a receipt you can forget it"" is inaccurate. They can look up a purchase with the card--even if it's not their card. Personally I've only ever had issues with Lowes customer service--never with Home Depot.
* Home Depot, IMO, tends to have higher quality goods for the comparable price tier. Not always, but often I've noticed this. This would be for things like blinds and toilets and decorative stuff. Not the same brand/model obviously. But the comparable item I feel I can generally count on to be higher quality at Home Depot--even if it is often a little more expensive.
* This will be highly local, but my Home Depot has *way* better staff.

>It always seems that HD is beating Lowes in revenue 

Home Depot has done much better with the pro crowd. As you can expect, it doesn't take too many local pros to overwhelm the sales volume of a thousand regular homeowners like you and me."
3749,best college for research,"The rankings for US versus World confused me; why are some that are high on the US rankings much lower on the World ones(like, beaten out by lower ranked US ones)???"
33256,best electric car,Seems you're right.  If every Lightning can do it that is definitely nice.
