5189,"I frequent both. 

* I have the credit cards for both. Lowes give you a blanket 5% off with the credit card. That's pretty good. So if there's similar goods for the same price, I'll go do Lowes. A lot of what I buy are essentially commodity goods (lumber, drywall, concrete) so I don't care where I buy it--just what price I pay.
* Home Depot does 1 year no-questions-asked returns on most everything with the credit card. And your ""if you  don't have a receipt you can forget it"" is inaccurate. They can look up a purchase with the card--even if it's not their card. Personally I've only ever had issues with Lowes customer service--never with Home Depot.
* Home Depot, IMO, tends to have higher quality goods for the comparable price tier. Not always, but often I've noticed this. This would be for things like blinds and toilets and decorative stuff. Not the same brand/model obviously. But the comparable item I feel I can generally count on to be higher quality at Home Depot--even if it is often a little more expensive.
* This will be highly local, but my Home Depot has *way* better staff.

>It always seems that HD is beating Lowes in revenue
