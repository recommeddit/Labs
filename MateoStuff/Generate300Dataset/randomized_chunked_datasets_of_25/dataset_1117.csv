Edit: Also, could I just LOL at you thinking you needed to justify picking *Imran* over Afridi? I mean sure, one's only *easily* the greatest cricketer Pakistan has ever produced, while the other played all of 20 odd Tests with a so so record, but yea, tough choice.",best cricket teams of all time

49104,"I have the LG27GL83a, it's an excellent monitor with two exceptions. 1.) You can't pan the screen horizontally. It can tilt up/down and be raised/lowered, but can't adjust left/right. 2.) The standard base takes up a lot of space. I'm strongly considering getting a VESA mount off the back of my desk to free up the desk space.

Otherwise, colors look good, response time is good, it's g-sync compatible for Nvidia cards, and it's a reasonable price.",best gaming monitor

38379,"I'm not going to lie, I'm a broke college student. So I'll give you my list of publications that are free that I constantly read/listen to:

\- The Associated Press, Reuters (wire)

\- ProPublica, The Intercept, WhoWhatWhy (investigations & independent)

\- Democracy Now!

\- NPR

I'm into a lot of investigations, independent news, and wire services because I don't like partisan news. These independent news organizations usually are ""close to bias-free,"" because there isn't a political party that they're supporting. It's just straight reporting.

I was able to get a free subscription to the NYTimes as well because I'm a college student, so if you're a college student, look into that.

I also read my local newspaper, but like someone else said, I work for them, so I get it for free.",best newspapers to read
