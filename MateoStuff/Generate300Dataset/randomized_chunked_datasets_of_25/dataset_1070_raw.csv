"Agreed on getting them through sci-hub first to read them in full, and check that the paper’s actually what you need . but then if you need them for something other than satisfying your curiosity it may be better to then try and contact the people who wrote it and get stuff from a more ‘official’ source, and maybe get an eventual contact, specially if both of you work in related stuff."
"With no exaggeration, that book gave me the most durable and useful reality tunnel for understanding life. It's the bedrock of my personal philosophy. 

It is my personal favorite psychology book, and my favorite philosophy book."
Heat by Michael Mann starring Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. The movie didn't do that well but I loved it. You can also see Collateral.
"You have a really healthy lawn so I'd stick with pillar shaped trees around the perimeter (so many people on here complain they can't get grass to grow because of trees).
 
Maybe a wall of tall vertical hedge on the right side property line and to help balance that out another individual of the same type behind the sidewalk hand rail."
Corn mush. About to have some right now
"Really? Damn, I think they're one of the best in the genre with Thyrfing and Amon Amarth. 

I think Alestorm is kind of an acquired taste, it does however fit when you binge on whisky, rum, ale and stout lol."
"Alan Watts, The Way of Zen."
"thank you, I'll take a look"

Amazing list OP I have every single one of those fragrances on my shelf!  Glad to see I'm not the only one who loves  the classics from the 70s.

"i just like cold beer.  as long as it isn’t a wheat beer.

this citrus IPA craze has been my jam in particular, though."
"Definitely. Board games is, like many things, quite subjective in that regard.

Definitely not the best but I'm SOOOO happy to see you mention it
"The fact that this is downvoted really goes to show how little of this sub watched Jerry Rice... like you can disagree, sure, but to think that Jerry Rice being the overall GOAT is outlandish enough that it needs to be downvoted? Y’all are wack...

Edit: was at -3(would’ve been -4 if not for my upvote) when I commented this

Edit 2: seriously look at these fucking [highlights](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qOh_moZ2N0A)"
Best crust in the valley!
"Missouri:
We have the Lake of the Ozarks (and the surrounding area), many state parks, and a bunch of caves.  As far as cities go, Kansas City is must because of the BBQ.  St Louis is also worth visiting, although I'd do a bit of research on where to go/avoid since it doesn't have a great reputation, especially here on Reddit.  If you're into tourist traps Branson can also be fun for like a day or two."
