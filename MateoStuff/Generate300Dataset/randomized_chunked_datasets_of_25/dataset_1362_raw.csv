"Wow! I hope my boyfriend has an attitude like that when we have kids :) good on ya!
I agree a spa say would be awesome, provided that she was completely comfortable with whoever was looking after bubs as it could be difficult for her to fully relax. 
Ask her what she needs from you! Better to get a loving neck rub every night than one expensive gesture IMO!"

I'd like to hear from that 10th dental detractor. What's his angle? Is he in bed with the mouthwash people? Is he just trying to be a dental hipster? There are many questions.

I love del Pueblo. I don't think it's a whole in a wall. Its authentic Mexican decor.

"Who cares. They strap a motor to a shell and call it “drivable”. Whoopdee fuckin do. Its still a concept and not production. Most of the “concepts” companies show off arent drivable vehicles. Theyre shapes with just enough parts to get to and sit on a display stand. Thats the way the industry works. 

Who cares if the commercial was cgi either. News flash, most are. The fact remains, gm has a much better capacity to deliver on their products and promises than tesla."
"Yeah that’s fair, they’re not for everyone. I have this special made Tupperware thing that poaches them in a microwave in 45 secs, fits the description."
Cast iron is very heavy and so it holds a lot of heat.  When you slap a piece of meat on a pan a lot of heat goes from the pan into the food and cools the pan until the burner can heat it up again.  With cast iron the pan doesn't cool as much since it has a lot of mass so you get a more even cooking experience.  Also you can put a cast iron pan in the oven so you can do things like a shepards pie all in one pan.  Plus the things are near indestructable and good for hitting burglars with.

My top 2 for sure. Others are kind of loosely rpgs or don't quite appear as rpg.

How do you find motivation or time to get up and make this sort of epic meal? The only time I can do it is the weekend and I usually want to catch up on sleep.

"Vertical mouse. $20. Saved my wrist using it at work all day.

It looks odd but it feels so much more natural. I even got a bunch of people at my office to buy one after they tried mine.

"That's actually really cool. I was thinking about building a section on my desk where I can stand. Also using stuff from IKEA, there was this blog post a while ago: http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html

I probably will do this the next time I make a trip to IKEA.

Here is a pic of my desk with the monitor stand. It's still clean as I recently moved it from one room to another. http://i.imgur.com/wOai0kr.jpg"
Everything on the list of worst options are the only things that sound interesting to me :(
