"They smell fucking weird and are nocturnal so they make chirpy noises all night.


Also, they smell weird.


Did I mention they smell weird? Because they smell weird."
What about sennhiesers HD8
"Slowly, slowly, slowly ******* faster"
Isn’t that the one that is haunted?  Or is that just your pride that haunts you for going to that one?
Bacon topped with bacon with a side of bacon. Oh and orange juice.
Store bought popcorn balls weren't bad
"That's true. I do know our marketing team are currently making a more comprehensive front page as we speak. 

We only soft launched the site 2 weeks ago, I just wanted to share with OP as it sounds like he's in the same boat we were when we made Enhance."
"I dislike 'sweet' sweet potatoes usually - like sweet potato pie or casserole. But I like the 'savory' sweet potatoes like hash browns and in stir fry. If, perhaps, you've only ever had them sweet, you might like them savory better. IMO, they're better with salt & fat than they are with sugar :)"
"Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet is a beautiful light peony and rose.

Versace Yellow Diamond (EdT) is a pretty fruity floral, quite affordable too.

Many Jo Malones will check that box, Bluebell is a nice one.

MMM Springtime in a Park is a nice fresh floral with lovely green notes."
There is Milkyway fix for iOS 14 from Brandon repo . This way milkyway2 (free) works on iOS14.
"This question pops up from time to time.  I'll repost my last answer. It's not by any means exhaustive. Maybe someone else has some recommendations.

A very good one is John Mason Hart's *Revolutionary Mexico*: it's pretty commonly used.   Friedrich Katz's *The Life and Times of Pancho Villa* is a truly excellent - and careful- biography that sorts out a lot of legend from reality- but it's not a thin book, you'll need some time to go through it. Brenner's venerable *The Wind that Swept Mexico* has a simplistic and dated text, but includes a lot of great photos ( some classic ones) and used copies of it are common. 

An excellent TV documentary, *The Storm that Swept Mexico*, is now over on [YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVWcgOcvgV0)"
What would you recommend instead?
Longevity/Performance is not solid.. it smells great but doesn't last long. I think Eros Edt was a better performer and I believe its Edp version should be even stronger imo but im yet to try it.
"I once met Ryan Braun, a baseball player from the Brewers.  He happened to walk into a Qdoba after a game (that I had attended) one night.  The place was empty except for my girlfriend and myself.  He saw us looking at him and he came right up to us and offered to take a picture with us and sign autographs.  On TV, he definitely comes across as a rather cocky guy, but in person he was cool as hell."
How is the longevity and performance of Ichnusa compared to Phylisikos?
I agree.
"Real cost is not 30k-40k. The UC's have been targeting the middle class for new scholarship and financial aid programs. My parents made about 190k combined and after their contribution (10k a year or so) and financial aid I only came away about 25k in debt. 

The UC's may be an option for you children."
"It’s just that when you forget the sarcasm tag, people will assume you’re a dick.

Maybe I should have just applied Hanlon’s Razor to your comment?"
This looks quite interesting. Probably going to start using it on my Pi since ranger has been a little slow on it.
And then ship the pelican case to your destination.
I just picked up ghost of tuishima and can’t put it down. Meets your reps and I think better than god of war.
Ultra Boosts thoooo cmon OP!
Cherry Cordial
