"Yas BW/BW2, still the best so far"
fair point!
If you're sneaky you could quietly pull up the carpet and then just paint the entire room with diarrhea.
Iâ€™d argue that diamond and pearl actually play slower then RBY.  And that the bugs are exaggerated since the average player wouldnâ€™t even run into any bugs on a RBY play through.  That said they still are objectively the worse.
Have you seen *A Beautiful Mind*? I feel like that it's a little more somber but would fit well with the theme.
"I love the absolutely minimal cases like MNML. Since MNML are pretty pricey, [Tozo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07W9LVZT3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) makes one just like it on Amazon for much cheaper. Now I just need my phone to get here..."

"Colds are all about symptom management. For each symptom, there is a simple remedy. For nasal congestion, hot soup always clears me out. For sore throat + throat congestion, gargle hot water mixed with saltwater. Vicks vaporub is effective as well as a nice shot of alcohol. Drinky plenty of fluids, consume fruits for essential nutrition, and keep active."

"I am going toÂ follow this. I am new to mech boards and currently putting one together with 67g Zealios. I have tried Kailh blue, Gat brown, Gat clear. The Gat clears are way too light and Kailh blues too loud (according to others lol). The Gat browns are okay but a little light and not enough bump. Should have the Zealios Friday!"

"Indeed restrictions are BS. though they can sometimes be limitations of a development cycle (does not excuse AAA titles).

Now that prices are more reasonable the restrictions are becoming less annoying (though still annoying), and I hope people who've wanted to play these games take advantage of that fact.

Edit: Realized you're not only a mod, but the creator of PCMR (It helps to read sidebars eh?), and I was kinda worried this thread would be deleted - which would suck - as even I personally intend to use this list in the future.  Thank you for making me feel better :O"
"see my world history had mostly to do with stuff America is interested in: 
Early man
Greeks
Romans 
British
America
India and China (for trade importance) 

Almost nothing on Japan, Australia, New Zealand (which we didn't even talk about as a country...at all) or the majority of Europe except to talk about how crazy it is because power/country borders change so much."
"Stanley Baldwin did. But that was a while ago.

Cameron got forced out due to Brexit.

Brown lost an election.

Blair sold his soul to George Bush, and is now watching his legacy burn as a result.

Major lost an election.

Thatcher got effectively deposed.

Callaghan was brought down by the Winter of Discontent.

Wilson was slowly losing his mind due to Alzheimer's.

Heath lost an election.

Douglas-Home lost an election.

Scandal forced Macmillan to step down.

The Suez crisis was Eden's undoing.

Then Churchill resigned a old and broken man.

Attlee lost an election.

Churchill lost an election.

Misjudging Hitler cost Chamberlain his job.

And then we're at Baldwin, a happy ending at last. (Although appeasing the Germans has caused his legacy to be picked to pieces)

Nobody walks out of 10 Downing Street because they want to."
Where have you been getting your coupons from? I've been meaning to buy a bottle.
"From what we've seen so far, it will be an incremental upgrade over the 11. But I will say this, they've been dropping the price of their base model iphone from XR to 11 for example. So, if you can get by on your current phone, wait till the 12 launches. If you want, you can buy the 12 at that time, but the 11 will be even cheaper by then."
