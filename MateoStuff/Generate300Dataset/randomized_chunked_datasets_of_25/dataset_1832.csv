31480,best hotel to live in,"I'm going to go for value, not quality. I've only stayed in one luxury hotel in my life, as a kid, and while playing racquetball was fun and all... it was more meaningful for me as an adult paying my own way when I was driving on I-70 west of St. Louis late at night and started feeling exhausted, and I saw a billboard for a $29 motel promising tons of standard amenities. I was actually leaving St. Louis early to escape a ghetto motel from hell, and was pleasantly surprised that I got one of the most comfortable rooms I've ever stayed in for my $29.

Colonial Inn in High Hill, MO. Not fancy, and in the middle of nowhere, but in a pinch, I recommend it."
