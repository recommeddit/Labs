Ok update it is so good that there is no resistance to binging !
"Yeah, I do this as a matter of course, because once you get the hang of it, it's way easier than keeping all the correct cable ties and cutting them to the right length. Rather than cable ties and side cutters I just have to carry a small blade, which is all you need to open them reliably. Only very occasionally do I have to replace one."
The ASUS TUF VG27AQ is a really good 1440p 144/165Hz monitor. I recently just purchased it myself. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WQ4FXY9?tag=rtings-mn-p-20&ie=UTF8) is the Amazon listing for it and [here](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/asus/tuf-vg27aq) is the [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) review for it.
"I said this on /r/everymanshouldknow and ill put it here aswell:

My parents are dentists and so are their friends and so are their friends' friends and let me tell you what I have learnt: only 2 things matter. Now, you may think I am oversimplifying or trying to keep it short and snappy to make it sound good but no! Literally only 2 things matter! Got that?

Now, here are the two questions you ask: does it have Flouride? The exact salt doesn't matter but does it advertise Flouride? If it doesn't then it is not worth your time and money. Seriously, without a doubt Flouride is good for your teeth and fucking essential in tooth paste. The rest doesn't add any benefit. Flouride plus good brushing technique and you have perfect teeth (floss aswell but I don't have time to lecture you on that). If you want brand reccomendations I have been reccomended Colgate ALL MY LIFE (I'm not exaggerating I can't believe everyone around me wasn't a paid sponser) but Oral B's pro expert (great naming guys) is also good.

Question 2: Do I have sensitive teeth? Really you should know this already most people do. If you have sensitive teeth (ie pain when you eat something hot or cold (see your dentist and not me!)) you get special tooth paste, which also has Flouride (essential stuff). The main brand for senstive toothpaste in the UK is sensodyne.
Now lastly, you may be thinking but what about things like whitening, salts, baking soda, natural (whatever the hell they decide to put), fresh breath and deep clean? All marketing bullshit, there is a reason I said only 2 question the rest doesn't matter what so ever just ignore it because it is a waste of your goddamn time. As a matter of fact whitening toothpastes are bad for your teeth. The yellow-ish tint is not bad its hard stuff that has developed over ages. Make no mistake ""whitening"" means mild corrosive and you don't want that, not at all.

TLDR: All that matter is that it has flouride and is for sensitive teeth (if you have sensitive teeth). Also, whitening is bad."
"My favorite movies that fall into both the action and adventure categories (and are thus action-adventure) are:

1. the Indiana Jones series (1981-2008 \[with a new one currently being made\]) - An archaeologist battles to prevent artifacts from falling into villainous hands. The original three (1981-1989) are all masterpieces, but the fourth, as has already been said in this thread, only really works if you divorce it from the rest of the franchise.
2. the Star Wars series (1977-2019) - The Skywalker family finds itself involved in a series of galactic wars. The original trilogy (1977-1983) is clearly the best of all of them, but, if you want, watch them all in release order to make up your own mind.
3. *Metropolis* (1927) - Being a silent science-fiction epic about tensions between the upper and working classes reaching their breaking point, this may seem like a weird choice. However, it does become an action-adventure movie in the last third, and, despite being silent, it's loud-as-Hell, thanks to its bombastic visuals and incredible Gottfried Huppertz musical score.
4. *The Wind and the Lion* (1975) - Very, very, very, very, very loosely based on a true story, a hostage crisis in 1904 Morocco brings the United States to the brink of war with desert rebels.
5. *The Magnificent Seven* (1960) - This classic western is about a team of seven gunslingers traveling to Mexico to protect a defenseless village there from a gang of bandits.
6. *The Guns of Navarone* (1961) - During World War II, a team of Allied commandos is dispatched to the Greek island of Navarone to sabotage two massive Nazi cannons there.
7. *Khartoum* (1966) - It's probably not really an action movie, but it's still an adventure flick with a reasonable amount of top-notch action. During the Mahdist War, a British officer is dispatched to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum to evacuate it in the face of a jihadist insurrection led by the Mahdi. Will he follow orders or dig in?
8. *The Great Escape* (1963) - Like *Khartoum* above, it may not be a true action film, but it's still an adventure picture with some great action. During World War II, Allied prisoners-of-war plot their breakout from the Nazi prison-camp they're being held in.
9. *Duck, You Sucker* (1971) - A Mexican bandit and an Irish revolutionary team up to rob the Mesa Verde bank, but end up involved neck-deep in the Mexican Revolution.
10. *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* (1966) - Three gunslingers - including the Man with No Name - race against each other across the American Civil War-torn Wild West in search of a lost treasure of gold. It's actually the third film in a loose trilogy - the first two being *A Fistful of Dollars* (1964) and *For a Few Dollars More* (1965) - but those ones aren't really adventure flicks (though they're still excellent).
11. *Army of Darkness* (1992) - A chainsaw-handed smart-ass is transported back in time to the Middle Ages, where he must fight an army of the undead to return home. It's part of the Evil Dead franchise.
12. *Zulu* (1964) - During the Anglo-Zulu War, a small British outpost is besieged by thousands of Zulu warriors.
13. *Farewell to the King* (1989) - During World War II, an American soldier in the Pacific theater goes A.W.O.L. to become the leader of a tribe of natives in the jungles of Borneo.
14. *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl* (2003) - A blacksmith joins forces with a former pirate captain to rescue a woman who's been kidnapped by pirates. It's the start of a franchise.
15. *The Adventures of Tintin* (2011) - A reporter and his dog try to uncover the mystery of a model ship they purchased (animated, but still amazing).
16. *Jurassic Park* (1993) - A remote amusement park brings dinosaurs back to life with cloning technology.
17. *Wonder Woman* (2017) - Superhero Wonder Woman intervenes in World War I to put an end to it.
18. *The Real Glory* (1939) - A squad of American soldiers defend a remote Filipino village from Moro marauders during the Moro Rebellion.
19. *The Wild Geese* (1978) - A team of mercenaries raid Africa to rescue a recently-deposed president there.
20. *Walker* (1987) - It may not have enough action to be an action film, but it still has some action and is an adventure movie. This surreal, satirical biopic is about William Walker, the American mercenary who seized control of the Nicaraguan government in the 1850s.
21. *The Lego Batman Movie* (2017) -  This animated action-adventure-comedy is about the Lego version of Batman (in case the title didn't fill you in).
22. the Mission: Impossible series (1996-2018 \[with more being made right now\]) - Secret agent Ethan Hunt fights to save mankind from terrorists. My favorites are *Ghost Protocol* (2011) and *Rogue Nation* (2015).
23. *King Kong* (1933) - A film crew discovers a giant ape on an uncharted island.
24. *The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen* (2003) - Heroes of Victorian-era literature join forces to prevent a world war.
25. *Mighty Joe Young* (1949) - An ape raised in Africa by a human since childhood is brought to the United States to serve as a nightclub attraction.

These are just my favorites. I excluded action movies that I loved that didn't have a strong adventure component (like the masterpiece *Commando* \[1985\]), so there's plenty more exciting movies out there to enjoy."

"I ordered this first thing this morning, and I swear I was seeing their stock drop before my eyes."
"Go with a soft cream?  Please, anything but gray. I‚Äôm shopping for a home now, and gray just screams ‚ÄúI watch HGTV and there an amateur tile job somewhere on this property. Something is strange with the circuit breaker, and I considered painting the door orange.‚Äù I‚Äôm immediately suspicious that a gray house has been flipped by an eager beaver.

Edit to add: A gray interior also means a high probability of butcher block counter tops, with a 40% chance of open shelving."

"Travis and Tyler have both been around for roughly a decade and have built solid discogs. While one can argue Tyler isn't super influential outside the Odd Fututre era, one can't deny the impact Travis has already left on rap. That Travis/Thugger sound has kind of defined the last 10 years of rap outside of that counter of ""lyrical miracle spiritual individual"" bullshit style of rap."
I will Google this for reassurance but thank you anyway üòâ

"Any recommendations for a lightweight business laptop around $600? To be mainly used for google docs and browsing.

Id ideally be able to use this inside the office or outside in the al fresco area of the coffee shop, so heavy laptops, poor battery life and dim screens are issues that I want to avoid."
"I'm a sahm of a two year old and a 9 month old. Here's my under $500 wish list:


Maid service.

Hire a sitter or call in the grandmas, book a room, booze me up and bang me silly.

A day to myself. Hand me the keys and the cash and tell me to have a nice time. 


Actually, that's it for me, really."

"I will keep it simple and mention albums that are some of the best and underrated aswell

1. Jim Jones & Harry Fraud - The Fraud Department
2. Benny The Butcher & Harry Fraud - The Plugs I Met 2
3. Dave East & Millyz - Pablo & Blanco

These are fairly new but so far great

1. Lloyd Banks - Coti
2. DMX - Exodus

One of the best singles this year is without a doubt

Jay-Z & Nipsey Hussle - What It Feels Like"
This changed my entire perspective of my mother and made me feel so guilty for thinking the things the children in this story think.
