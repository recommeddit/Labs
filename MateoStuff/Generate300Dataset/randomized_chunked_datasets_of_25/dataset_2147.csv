67058,best places to skydive in california,I went Hollister as well. Highly recommend! The views are incredible...I never really realized how much time you spend under the parachute but it's several minutes and I think it's worth it go somewhere with a great view.
48507,best color to paint with,"1. SO and I debated about the overall scheme... I wanted earth tones, she wanted grays; we went with grays.

2. we went to Home Depot together and independent picked out a bunch of swatches for rooms (loosely agreeing that we wanted something dark and cool-toned for the bedroom, bright in the common areas, and we'd each do whatever we wanted in our home offices)

3. after Home Depot, went out to lunch and compared paint swatches. settled on 2-3 colors for each room.

4. bought samples of each color, painted them on the walls (on a sunny day with all the lights on), and went from there.

ultimately doing a very dark gray (accent wall) + white in the entry hallway, silver and gray in the living room/dining room, white in the kitchen, and a grayish blue in the bedroom... to accent the brick fireplace, we decided on a warmer gold for the basement den. I went with a pale green for my office, and I have no clue wtf color the other office is going to be."
7892,best laptop for general use,"I've spent weeks looking for the right laptop. I'm trying to stay around a 2K Max budget. I'm looking at something rather high end, 14"" max. After spending quite some time looking into it, it seems I have to chose between a tablet/laptop with the last Intel CPU's, or a classic laptop with a Ryzen.   


Can't figure whether ""tablet"" laptop are really worth it. I want something I can use at work that can take a 50 chrome tabs opened at the same time, but also versatile and compact enough that I can use on from my couch to look up something quickly or take a few notes. I play a bit as well, but mostly indie/2d games on steam, and the occasional 3d game but nothing AAA.   


&#x200B;

I tried last year's XPS 14 but it was overheating. I have at the moment a Thinkpad Extreme Gen 2 and have the same problem. I tend to attribute that to the presence of dedicated GPU's but I might be wrong. Hence why i'm looking at the latest Intel CPU.   


I like the Yoga Slim 9i but something tells me it might not be the right choice.   


Do you guys have opinions on that one (the Yoga 9i)? Or recommndations? So far, here are the ones that made it into my list:   
Yoga Slim 9i  
LG Gram 14  
Huawei MateBook X Pro 2021"
37016,best roller coaster at six flags,I don't find it rough at all.  I love that it's constantly turning and has no straight track on it... it just feels completely out of control and amazing.

661,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"Nord is a great all around 

But not for torrenting, lots of people still get copywrite warning from their service provide ""cut it out or go to jail'

Cyberghost is made for torrenting, not that I'm encouraging anything. Small disadvantage in speed, but it's better than going to prison"
30739,best country to live in,"Wrong. The world economy is essentially based around the dollar because it is the strongest. The biggest markets for most things are prominently in America. High standards on many top professions that other parts of the world emulate, etc. Granted some professions have surpassed Americans but you are ignorant if you honestly believe America has no standards that are influential."

52256,best hiphop album,rap instrumentals? its not rap if its instrumental and none of the songs on dilla donuts have rap.
19235,best YouTube video,"That's an absolutely insane amount of trust. Animals are usually so protective of their young that even trusted humans are rebuffed, so this person must have given this ferret lots of love to receive this kind of treatment. Or maybe ferrets are just really trusting and I'm a dumbass."

21933,best celebrity,"Met him at a film screening a few years ago - I've been a fan of his since I was 8 and he's legitimately an influence in my own music/comedy.   


I saw him when I sat down which happened to be right in front of him. I heard him introduce himself to some older ladies who had sat next to him, just very genuine like ""Hi, I'm Al!""   


I turned around and said hello, said I had just seen a show at the Greek and said it was great, and said this is a great moment of my life and he cracked a joke and said something like ""well I guess your life hasn't been THAT awesome!"" or something like that. We took a selfie and shook hands and it was awesome."
41228,best instrument to play,"Absolutely agreed. The first time I cried at a live piece of classical music was Saint-Saëns Cello Concerto No. 1 in A minor Op. 33. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ijSrsu8aMs) is a great performance of it, for the curious. 

Anyway, I don't know what it was about that piece, but I think it also had quite a lot to do with the cellist. A friend of mine played viola in the symphony, and I got to sit in on one of their rehearsals. The passion that came out of that instrument just blindsided me."

31373,best country to live in,"As someone who has plans to move to New Zealand to continue his education, awesome. :)

Great, easy-to-read table, by the way. Some of it is slightly subjective, but overall it's a neat tool and a good starting point for people that may want some change in their life."
