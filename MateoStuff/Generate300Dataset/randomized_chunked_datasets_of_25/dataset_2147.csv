48507,"1. SO and I debated about the overall scheme... I wanted earth tones, she wanted grays; we went with grays.

2. we went to Home Depot together and independent picked out a bunch of swatches for rooms (loosely agreeing that we wanted something dark and cool-toned for the bedroom, bright in the common areas, and we'd each do whatever we wanted in our home offices)

3. after Home Depot, went out to lunch and compared paint swatches. settled on 2-3 colors for each room.

4. bought samples of each color, painted them on the walls (on a sunny day with all the lights on), and went from there.

ultimately doing a very dark gray (accent wall) + white in the entry hallway, silver and gray in the living room/dining room, white in the kitchen, and a grayish blue in the bedroom... to accent the brick fireplace, we decided on a warmer gold for the basement den. I went with a pale green for my office, and I have no clue wtf color the other office is going to be.",best color to paint with
7892,"I've spent weeks looking for the right laptop. I'm trying to stay around a 2K Max budget. I'm looking at something rather high end, 14"" max. After spending quite some time looking into it, it seems I have to chose between a tablet/laptop with the last Intel CPU's, or a classic laptop with a Ryzen.   


Can't figure whether ""tablet"" laptop are really worth it. I want something I can use at work that can take a 50 chrome tabs opened at the same time, but also versatile and compact enough that I can use on from my couch to look up something quickly or take a few notes. I play a bit as well, but mostly indie/2d games on steam, and the occasional 3d game but nothing AAA.   


&#x200B;

I tried last year's XPS 14 but it was overheating. I have at the moment a Thinkpad Extreme Gen 2 and have the same problem. I tend to attribute that to the presence of dedicated GPU's but I might be wrong. Hence why i'm looking at the latest Intel CPU.   


I like the Yoga Slim 9i but something tells me it might not be the right choice.   


Do you guys have opinions on that one (the Yoga 9i)? Or recommndations? So far, here are the ones that made it into my list:

I saw him when I sat down which happened to be right in front of him. I heard him introduce himself to some older ladies who had sat next to him, just very genuine like ""Hi, I'm Al!""   


I turned around and said hello, said I had just seen a show at the Greek and said it was great, and said this is a great moment of my life and he cracked a joke and said something like ""well I guess your life hasn't been THAT awesome!"" or something like that.

Anyway, I don't know what it was about that piece, but I think it also had quite a lot to do with the cellist. A friend of mine played viola in the symphony, and I got to sit in on one of their rehearsals. The passion that came out of that instrument just blindsided me.",best instrument to play
