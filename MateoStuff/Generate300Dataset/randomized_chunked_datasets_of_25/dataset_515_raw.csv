I think you missed about three shots of Jack in the middle
"I enjoyed the first ones when she just kicked ass and did stuff other than sex, but lost all interest when they became pure orgy/furry porn :( Such a waste of a good series."
The Necromancer trilogy by Gail Martin is pretty good
ACDC's Rock and Roll ain't noise pollution
"Some of these have probably been mentioned already, but I might as well add my list.  In my opinion Hollywood does not make nearly enough movies in this genre.

The Lord of the Rings

The Indiana Jones films

The Star Wars saga

Titan A.E.

The Mummy/The Mummy Returns

Van Helsing (Yeah, I know.  It's a guilty pleasure.)

Hidalgo

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl

The Princess Bride

Jurassic Park"
It depends. I like both but for different things.
"Know you already got lot of replies, but just to summarize its a very advanced and streamlined macro.. deck? basically. 

But, if you ever did want to test it out without dropping $$$, they do have a mobile app (might only be on iOS not 100% sure) that you can subscribe for like $5 a month and try it out."
"[Krewe!](https://www.krewe.com/collections/st-louis-mirrored-1) I love these glasses. I like having one pair of nice glasses for wearing to brunch or shopping, and then having a bunch of cheap ones for boating, swimming, travelling. I need a prescription pair for driving though and I'm hoping to get something with a classic silhouette, maybe [Holly Golightly like](http://68.media.tumblr.com/0e8bcd29a93023a42bad010a39590278/tumblr_ncj4vrWwZ51qhekpro1_250.gif)."
">Dont listen to the audiobook anybody, you will hate it."
"Except those aren't really features.

Those HTTP codes have specific meanings and you really shouldn't be handling them the same way, they can also be used quite differently in different systems and with different APIs.

You're going to be writing some filter logic in most cases anyway.

And having the json cast be separate is also good as it allows you to handle connection errors separately from parsing errors, because again, those are two different things.

Axios requires less code if you don't care about handling your errors, but it's actually more code if you do."

"I have yet to see a Ryzen 4000 series 17"" non gaming laptop... if you downgrade in specs, the [**HP Envy 17**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-laptop-17-cg0019dx) is a solid choice."
"I haven't personally worn them, but the quality of construction is excellent. To say they're beautiful would be an understatement. As I recall, I was told by a huge gunglass guy that these were the best sunglasses he's ever worn in terms of both lens quality and how they look. Make sure you can pull of whatever pair you're thinking of before buying them, since they're pretty polarizing (no pun intended). If you can, I'd get them. These are very elegant sunglasses. 

Disclaimer: don't have a ton of experience with these guys. From what I can tell, they're a safe bet."
"Let's say there are two towns

Town A has budget of 100 million and 100 residents.

Town B has budget of 200 milion.and 10000 residents.

Which town has better economy? 

Per capita is of PARAMONT important.

 What good is having more good schools if they are inaccessible to most of the population? 

Virginia has good schools available to a much.higher percentage of citizens - -so.Virginia's system is better."
"Hyperion, End of eternity, Dune."
I’m a big fan of dbrand. High quality. Good service. Reasonable prices.

"Yeah, I listen to comedy podcasts at the gym."
"really I’d recommend these authors entire backlist, but if I had to pick I’d say {Walk of Shame by Lauren Layne} for the contemporary lovers & {The Rogue of Fifth Avenue by Joanna Shupe} for anyone interested in historical"
"Meteorology degree, because I can make almost 100k a year with just a 4-year degree. Unfortunately it is also hard as fuck to get in four years."
"My ex-boyfriend's mother met Stephen King in the gym. They were the only two people there. When he finished his workout and got up to leave, he couldn't find the exit. 

Ex's mother says: ""Looking for a way out?"" 

King responds: ""Aren't we all?"" and smiles.



Oh! I forgot--I met Native American character actor Wes Studi in a bar. He was kind of self-aggradizing. Wes, my next-door neighbors, and I went to a cigar bar after the first bar. He was flashing money around. He also ran his hand up my shin and commented ""Someone got waxed today."" Wow, dude."
"It’s really pretty good- if it they keep it clean and functional it’ll have a good future.

At THIS moment it would be awesome to have an “import” function for sources..and I’ve found a few repo’s that seem to time out or do t work with Zebra."
Right?
At least haha
