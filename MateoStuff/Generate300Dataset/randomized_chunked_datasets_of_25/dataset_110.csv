3. The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson

Lots of people are saying you never go fullscreen. That is wrong, uninteresting streamers never go full screen. Good streamers have tons of different scenes, including full screen for chatting with viewers.

Stream quality is a big part of what attracts follows, shoot high. You don't need a seperate PC with an El Gato and a mirrorless DSLR for a webcam, but seriously don't cheap out on stuff that costs less than a hundred bucks.

Streamers with bad cams and bad mics are a dime a dozen, be better and you'll get attention.",best webcamera

Also it developed double clicking issues in a matter of weeks and when i had sweaty hands it felt really slippery.

The VPU has light switches which are indeed different feeling than the GPW switches but at least they do not double click and the QC is great so far at least in my copy of it.",best wireless lightweight mouse

The reason you ‘can’t get enough‘ is because you blame your lack of skill on a piece of equipment. The scary part isn’t just that you are a dumbass but the fact that you aren’t going to find your ‘endgame’ at all.

I buy most POPULAR mice to find MY ‘endgame’. Do you understand the stupidity of your thinking?
Not to mention that these mice are only popular on this sub where 95% of people are exact idiots like you.
