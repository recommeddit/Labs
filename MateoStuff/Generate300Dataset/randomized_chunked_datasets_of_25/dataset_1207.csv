15869,best sunglasses for fashion,"Throwaway because I don't like giving clues about who I am on my main account. I sell sunglasses as a job, so this is my area of expertise. 

Quick tips:

* If you do a lot of driving or have sensitive eyes, get a pair of polarized glasses. There's some sciency stuff, but basically, it reduces glare quite a bit. 

* Don't leave them in the car, either. The heat bends them out of shape, especially if they're plastic (but even the metal ones can get weird if you put them on when they're hot). 

* Buy the lens cleaner. It's cheap and usually wherever you get it will do free refills. Windex is not the same and will absolutely ruin the lenses. 

* You get what you pay for. Cheap sunglasses won't have UV protection, the polarization will be poorly done and likely to rub off when you clean them, and they can break pretty easily. 


Brands*:
 
* Maui Jim:  Overall, these are the best glasses you can get, especially dollar for dollar. They're solidly constructed, people will have a pair that lasts them 6+ years no problem. They're all polarized (I believe they're all double polarized, so you really won't be squinting in these). The weight distribution is great, so they feel light on your face. If you get the sports, you won't even feel them. Oh, and they come with a 2 year warranty. Only downside is that some of them aren't that great to look at. On the other hand, there are some extremely good looking pairs. My favorites are: Baby beach, makaha, front street, cat III, and cliff house. 

* Ray Ban: Other than the iconic wayfarers, aviators, and clubmasters, they aren't much to look at. Lens quality is okay but nothing special. I noticed I get a LOT of ray ban repairs. Probably 80% of my repairs are ray bans. Could be because they're more popular, but I've seen more screws fall out than I can count, lens layers separating, the plastic reacting with people's skin and turning white, etc. I don't find them to be very comfortable personally. Everyone has a pair, but that doesn't mean they're the best sunglasses. I get a lot of people who are VERY insistent that they only want Ray Bans. It's silly, you're selling yourself short. They're a good starter pair, don't plan on them lasting for more than 2 years. They might, but they also might not. Huge lack of variety, as well. They put 70% of their energy into 3 styles. They really work on some people, but not everybody. Favorites: club masters, wayfarers, aviators. They make all three of those in a travel version which folds up and you can put them in your pocket (in the case which is just as small). Worth checking out if you're on the go a lot.

* Prada: The lens quality is pretty good from what I've seen but I haven't had a chance to take them for a real spin. Aesthetically, these are the top dogs in my book. They use very clean lines and everything looks ""just so"". I could see a pair of pradas I've never seen before and I'd know they were prada because nobody makes glasses that crisp. A little pricey, but if you want to look good, prada will get it done.

* versace: Surprisingly cheap for the brand name. They are not well made. I've heard the lens quality is phenomenal, but the actual glasses look and feel somewhat cheap a lot of the time. I wouldn't get these. 

* Persol: These guys look amazing, good lens quality, too. Only gripe I have is that the screws always seem to be coming loose. For non-wired glasses, these might be more aesthetically pleasing than the Pradas. The Havanas in tortoise shell are probably my favorite from their collection. Don't have a ton of experience with these, but they are very nice glasses. 

* Burberry: Very comfortable sunglasses for the most part. I actually think they did the clubmasters better than ray ban, so if you don't like how the ray bans looked on your face, check these out. They also have some new pairs with leather behind the ear which is probably extremely comfortable when you break them in. I feel that they're a little overpriced overall, but that's the case with most brands that don't exclusively make sunglasses. Check out the round and square trenches. 

* Oakley: Don't get them to look good, you probably won't. If you own guns, play sports, or ride a bike, these might be for you. They're pretty hard to break (sit on them, shoot them with a gun, stomp on them, you're not going to break them). There's a video on youtube of a pair taking a bullet and looking like nothing happened. All of the pieces are replaceable, too. Great value, well made, very comfortable. They aren't very stylish, though. I like the gas cans and the ferrari series, but they're hard to pull off.

Overall, Maui Jim is what gets my recommendation. If your budget is unlimited, the Oakley juliets in titanium are pretty nice if it's your style and easily the most comfortable pair I've ever tried by a wide margin. Otherwise, Maui jims are a good bet. If you're fashion conscious on a budget (sub 150) Ray ban wayfarers, though they wouldn't be polarized at that price. Feel free to ask about any other brands and I'l tell you what I know. These were just a few that came to mind.

* you cant go wrong with these brands. I know I was a little harsh about ray bans but it was partially because I was coming down off of the euphoria of preaching the Maui Jim gospel. If it's on the list, it's worth a look.

11156,best backpack for college,"Jansport make the greatest small rucksack I have ever owned: the [Trinity](http://www.jansport.com/js_product_detail.php?cid=100&pid=TUJ0). It lasted through my last three years of secondary school, hauling serious book tonnage.  Then it got another three years of college, being scuffed off bus floors, getting filthy and going through the washing machine repeatedly. After six years of almost-daily use, the bag is still as solid as ever.  No structural failures; just a small hole in the back pocket where the pressure of keys caused some abrasion. That's practically cosmetic.  

Now, I'm not a person who is kind to my bags.  In the same time, after only occasional use, the internal frame on my 80l Vango rucksack has worn through the fabric.  After only one year of occasional use, my Deuter day bag has lost a zip and the buckle on the chest strap.  I'll probably replace them with Jansport stuff when I can afford to.  

edit: sp

Jansport also have a lifetime warranty on all their bags.  Boom.  What more could you want?"
