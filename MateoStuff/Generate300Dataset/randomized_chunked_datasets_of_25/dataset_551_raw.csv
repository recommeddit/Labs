"Cavalier King Charles spaniels are hard to beat, as are rough/smooth collies. Both breeds love children more than any others I’ve worked with."
"Yep, as a GIS user I'm always sad when Michigan gets left off maps. Michigan Tech isn't on the list and neither are the other 2 universities I went to in Missouri or South Dakota."
Great detailed list. Thank you very much!
"And Germany does a lot of research outside of universities (Fraunhofer, Planck, Helmholtz, Leibniz etc.), hence both countries don't perform good on those ""how British is your university""-rankings."
"Seems like everyone is listing hotels in Asia but since I’ve never been ill have to go with grand hotel des trois rois, in Basel Switzerland. Also had a chance to dine at their three star Michelin restaurant, Cheval Blanc by Peter Knogl

A little known David Tennant TV series (3 episodes) is [The Escape Artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Escape_Artist_(TV_series)). $7.99 on Amazon Prime, well worth it. I've seen most of what everyone here has suggested, and above all I most often think about the Escape Artist."
Tainted Love by TokyoMilk. I think it smells luxurious and musky and it's my favorite perfume; it definitely gets the most compliments and questions because it's not popular enough to be easily recognizable. I usually don't wear it much in the summer though since I go for something light and herbal in the hot weather. I'm excited to start wearing it again!
"Nice, enjoy it."
