An alternative is using Wretch which works on top of fetch.",axios alternatives reddit

11415,"- A quality wallet, belt, briefcase, or really anything from [Saddleback Leather](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/). All of this stuff lasts literally a lifetime.

- A quality safety razor or a new badger hair shaving brush. 

- A new pair of Red Wing boots. These also last a lifetime. Dark brown goes with everything. 

- A new knife. Gerber blades are good quality. If he's an outdoors kind of guy get him a fixed-blade survival knife. If not then get him a folding knife. Don't get a small knife, and don't get a ridiculous knife.

- A leather bound journal. Find one that has acid-free paper. Get a nice pen with it too.

- An engraved flask, or an engraved zippo lighter. Get the bourbon or cigar to go with it.

- Don't get him a card. Write a hand-written note instead. It can be short and to the point, but make it genuine. Trifold it.",best gifts for dad

67879,"In only a vague sort of order:

*Player of Games* by Iain M Banks

*Hydrogen Sonata* by Iain M Banks

*The Expanse Series* by James SA Corey (bit of a cheat but it's basically one long book right?)

*The Long Earth* by Terry Pratchett & Stephen Baxter (but not really the rest of the series)

*The Collapsing Empire* by John Scalzi. I loved *Old Man's War* but there's some wonderful phrase turning in *The Collapsing Empire* series

*Sea of Rust* by C Robert Cargill. Recent but I loved it.

*The Quantum Thief* series by Hannu Rajaniemi

*Bloodlines* by Karen Traviss. Star Wars books may not always be considered proper sci fi, but hey there's aliens, space travel and I'm really fond of this book!

*The Algebraist* by Iain M Banks. 3 separate entries for Banks while others get 1 mention from a whole series but hey ho.

~~*Children of Time* by Adrian Tchaikovsky.~~

**Edit**: *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams. My view of this is slightly tainted by the 5th book, but after thinking about it a bit I remember really enjoying the 1st one so it deserves a place in my top 10, edging out *Children of Time*.",best science fiction novel

32068,"The Mira Hotel in Hong Kong. 

Apart from the basic amenities they have (e.g.: mini bar, complimentary water, coffee and tea, hairdryer, bath tub, etc), what I loved about it is their Pillow Menu. And they're all complimentary. You can request for a full body pillow, a lavender or rose-infused pillow, a hypoallergenic pillow and others. They have like around 6 kinds of pillows to choose from besides the two regular pillows included. I asked for a lavender-infused pillow and a full body pillow and they are glorious to use.

I know one of my coworkers tried to request for 6 pillows and her bed started to look and feel like a coffin lol. But she says she had the most amazing sleep.",best hotel to live in
