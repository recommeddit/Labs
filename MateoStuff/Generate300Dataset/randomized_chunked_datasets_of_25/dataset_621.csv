41241,best instrument to play,"As a french horn player, stick to only the professionals. I don't think there exists a middle ground for the french horn. Either awful, or amazing."
15034,best romantic novel,"The Last Unicorn. It's a really nice heartbreaking romance and fantasy.

And idk if it's read worthy, because I haven't read it yet, but I took one of my mom's romance novels. It has Icelandic vocab in it for some reason and learning foreign languages is my hobby."
62161,Best RPG game on PS4,Digimon Story series. Very underrated JRPG series.
10447,best suitcase lock,You should also remember that hotel safes aren't necessarily safe. Hotel staff may have a master code to the safes. Also when I'm traveling outside Europe I have a printed copy of my passport & scanned version in my email.
43602,best items under $100,"so truee! I've been using one for years so I don't even remember how big the difference was, but recently I convinced my bf to buy himself one and he was like ""wtf my teeth never fealt so.. brushed"""
36580,best alcoholic drink,Waiting for someone to mention one of the signature cocktails from Danger 5.
72032,best movies with a cool twist,Yea I did. Than saw yours. This movie has THE best twist.
68526,best science fiction novel,"Yep that Top 5 is so dead on for me.

Actually the only one in the top 15 that I don't think belongs is Starship Troopers. The movie is fantastic, I didn't enjoy the book at all. I'd probably replace it with Liu Cixin's The Dark Forest or Iain Bank's Use of Weapons. Atleast Use of Weapons is on there though, that book is a masterpiece."
57900,best cologne,"Brut. You don't wear Brut, Brut wears you."
22511,best celebrity,"I feel like I just answered this recently, lol.

Adam Lambert is a absolute gem, and I say this without bias. He's extremely kind, remembers me when I see him, and makes an effort to honestly connect with you. Even told me that it was nice to see ME again when I last saw him, haha. I've had some definite moments of feeling special while being around him, and that's a great feeling when you admire someone. <3"
73274,best Linux distro,"Linux Mint: If you want an out of the box windows feel, go for this. It is based on Ubuntu (which itself is based on Debian), so you'll find almost every linux app for it. 

Ubuntu: More noob friendly. Clean interface with minimal clutter. Though, it is very different from windows, you'll get used to it quickly. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, as suggested by its name, is a long term support version. I think it supported till 2025(?). Very good starting point, it's were i started.

Debain: The original, Ubuntu is based of off it. It is more on the technical side, as it requires you to have a little bit of knowledge of how linux works before. Wouldn't suggest  it either as a starting point. Though, it is very fun to experiment with. 

&#x200B;

Another candidate is Pop OS, it is based on Ubuntu too, and has a great community. I would HIGHLY suggest going with Pop OS as it focuses of productivity, gaming, and other fun stuff. It also has great Nvidia driver support (which are known to be a pain in the backside on linux). So if you have an Nvidia card, definitely go with this one. Also, in their latest version, they overhauled the UI, and i actually quite like what they've done. 

&#x200B;

As for being able to download windows apps....I'm gonna be fully honest with you. No distro (as far as i know) has out of the box support for them. You will have to install wine (a windows compatibility layer for linux) and ideally lutris if you want to play windows games that aren't on Steam. You can check which apps work on [WineDB](https://appdb.winehq.org/). If you want to check which games work, go to [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/). Proton is Valve's fork of wine. It has better compatibility for most Steam games than wine. But some games won't work with Proton, but will do with Wine. Most apps will be easy to install...but some are a ""different case"" to say the least. 

&#x200B;

Another point i need to make is that if you don't like the UI/UX on your chosen distro, you can just change it. Go over to r/UnixPorn and look at what people do with Linux. You can theme most Window Managers/Desktop Environments to make them look and feel exactly how you want.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long read, but as someone who has been using Linux for the past 6 months, i had to explain in a lot of detail so you don't make the same mistakes as I did."
32989,best energy drink,If you fancy getting hammered at the Same time the for real you want [Dragon Soop](https://www.dragonsoop.com)
19965,best workout music,This is why I workout at home.
13182,best gifts for mom,"It all depends on what type of mom she is, and that can also change from day to day, so communicate with her; or at least listen to her really well. 
When I was at this point in the SAHM routine this is what worked for me:
Having a service come and REALLY clean the house (while the baby and I had a nice lunch outside on the patio with a friend (the friend also brought the nice lunch). ;)

Similar situation, but relative or friend brings nice dinner so hubby and I can sip wine and eat pasta at the table while relative/friend takes care of baby in the other room.

I didn't want to be away from my baby for long at all, don't wear much jewelry and wouldn't know what to do with a 'spa day'.  You really do have to know what she truly would like at this point, since she is most likely hormonal as hell and too tired to think straight. Again, LISTEN to her. 

If she likes jewelry, there are many sites out there that make beautiful, personalized pieces that any mother would cherish. 

If she likes spas, go for it! And  just make sure you have arranged acceptable chile care for her in advance. 

If she likes to look good, a shopping spree with some new/non-maternity clothes would be nice!

If she likes recording family moments, hire a professional photographer to come to the house and do a formal sitting....maybe pair that with a spa day so she looks extra relaxed?

There are sooooo many things you can do for her at this point, it just depends on her personality. The fact that you are even thinking along these lines shows that she is a lucky lady. I think you're going to do just fine, Daddy!"
19557,best YouTube video,"This happened about 20 minutes away from where I live, and it’s still talked about in my town to this day."

69208,best major to study in college,How about a Supply Chain/Finance double major? With a minor in accounting
56572,best desktop monitor,so the 1060 6gb wouldnt be good for 1080p 144hz or is 1070 just the recommendation
36422,best alcoholic drink,Beer. Cold Beer.
6635,best iPhone,Even when it is “no longer supported” it gets security updates for a really really long time. My iPhone 6 was still getting them and almost every app worked just fine on it
