"**An option to group hidden files in the end**

My favorite sort order is by descending date. And I have hidden files always visible. In that mode on home directory hidden files get in a way of comfortable work with other folders because of being updated frequently.

"Nice collection there! My first artisan pad (Hien soft) is coming in the next 2 ish weeks and have a few questions 

1. I’m coming from a pretty worn down QCK+ around 2 and a half years old, is the Hien going to feel like ice in comparison. I’ve literally only used the QcK for my pc gaming life so I really have no frame of reference to how fast the Hien is going to be.
2. I’ve got the viper mini with stock feet and cord (I have never nodded any mice before but could be getting into it potentially, slightly harder because of where I live but anyways) how do they perform on the Hien?
3. I know this is a standard question but if you had to main one mousepad for the rest of your life which mousepad would you choose?"

Yeah I've heard this argument often from Americans.  I'm hoping to not have to work high pressure jobs for the rest of my life.  What happens then?
No way! Arts majors don't make as much and have higher unemployment than engineers and people in health services? Who would've thunk it!

In most other circumstances, ""EXPLOSIVE"" is a pretty good word for playing hangman."
