55037,Acadia National Park has a ton of awesome hikes.  I liked the Bubble Rock trail even though it was short.  Blueberry Hill is a nice long hike.  If you are more adventurous then I am you can try Precipice Trail.  It's only 2 miles but it have a 930 ft elevation gain and iron rungs to climb up.  All in Maine if you do not know Acadia.,best places to hike in the east coast

4614,"I don't use what you use, but here goes for my experience.

I love Vim's modal and verb-object way better than anything else. I want that everywhere I can. That said…

* For big projects and frameworks a good IDE that supports vim plugins would feel a mistake to ignore. With a lot of work, snippets and macros one could sort of replicate the workflow, but that would be a whole part of your life dedicated to it for a long time. I use PHPStorm for Symfony, so where you have jinja2 I have twig and where you have Python I have PHP, and trust me it's bloody awesome when I create a controller, a template and whatnot and the right use statements are included on the go. Hard to beat really.
* When project-awareness is not warranted. Vim. But Spacemacs has qualities and defects of Vim with the best Vim emulation possible. Plus discoverability. Plus excellent defaults. Plus more or less standardized plugins ([layers](http://spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html)), sometimes making it WAY easier to get stuff up and running than spending the right amount of time and testing to find the right Vim plugin for you and the right way to install + configure it. With Spacemacs you put the name of the layer (eg ""yaml"") in the right place in the main dotfile (easy peasy), you reload and bam you're good to go with the community's preferred solution. I find that building an emacs config from the ground up is a tedious whole enterprise in and of itself, while building your favourite things on top of Spacemacs is fun.

If you feel like giving Spacemacs a go,  as a Vim fan with a terminal-multiplexer addiction (I love byobu to death), I'll suggest configuring your setup to use it as a daemon early on, so that once the daemon is started (ie at the init of the OS) you can start new instances way faster, and all communicating with one another. In terminal mode if you like ( ""-nw"").
