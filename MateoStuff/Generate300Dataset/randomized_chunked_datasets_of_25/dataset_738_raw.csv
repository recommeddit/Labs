8 plus! (I was an android user forever and then switched to iPhones with the 6 and then went from a 6 to an 8 plus)
Don't forget Where Ya At and Groupies
"Thank you a lot.

Of course Audiobookbay goes up again as soon as I post this. :P"
Are all the above tweaks working fine on iOS 14.3? anyway Im using Taurine.
there's been so many writer and director changes
"I can only speak from experience so I would recommend visiting Mount Rainier in Washington. It has a lot of hiking (from beginner to experienced) and some of the most beautiful landscapes! The wildflowers are a personal favorite of mine. If you enjoy lakes check out Lake Chelan (also in Washington). It is glacier-fed, super deep, and has crystal clear water. On one end of the lake is a lodge called Stehekin, and the only way to get there is by plane or boat. 

If you enjoy fishing, I'd say go to Alaska. I've personally only fished in Sitka, but it was the easiest and most rewarding fishing experience I've ever had. Plus it's beautiful up there! 

One last thing, I hope that your trip is fun, and safe!"
"I am going with it too can u tell me if the brightness is going to be enough for indoor gaming like i dont even know how bright is 350 cd/m2, this is going to be my first gaming monitor"
Ay-oh!
Nice! For me it was the only one that I could find with a slot for business cards. I ordered the apple case and wallet but it was way to thick.
"The reason why I'm asking is because in high school, I took calculus AB and BC which made me use the calculator for tons of things. Like I had word problems that required the use of the calculator to do an integral or derivative that would be impossible/way too tedious to do by hand.

So I wont be having those types of problems in multivariable calculus?"
"I love hip hop, but I guess I can only classify really as the radio listening type. But in my opinion I think in order for an album to  be the greatest of all time, they must have somewhat gained a bit of recognition in the mainstream.  Having said that, I find the lack of Eminem a little disappointing. I know a lot of hip hop heads discredit the dude for one reason or the other, but damn that album made headlines. And also risking contradicting myself,
 I find including kanye a bit disappointing. I always found kanye to have made gteat music, but not greatest of all time. I find the character kanye is much more interesting than his music, and sometimes I think when so many people tells me he is supposed to be some kind of genius musician, I just don't hear it. But yeah , I agree, Kendrick is one of a kind."
"Otterbox Symmetry, nothing special just damn good at what it’s supposed to do."
"The great 19th century Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell, perhaps the most competent proponent of Irish Home Rule. Parnell held the balance of power between the Liberals and the Conservatives and pushed through his vision of Irish independence.

Gladstone described him as: ""I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was an intellectual phenomenon."" Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A.J.P. Taylor says, ""More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation."""
It’s almost a copy pasta comment...
In the US? Money or friends with money.
"I guess there's some potential for some cool stuff there, but the clculators themselves are frustrating and expensive little gizmos. Especially considering that such things can and are easily emulated on computer and on phones for free. Do you happen to know the reason why? Is it for specialty equipment training?"
"The theracane. It's a hooked stick thing you can use to massage your own back. $30 on Amazon.

My neighbor bought one, and I went over to borrow it multiple times a day until I bought my own. It might not seem so important if you're not a manual laborer, but damn. It changed my life.

Nobody paid me to say this, it's just a damn good product."
"I agree. TSA has the right to open your luggage it's pretty obvious when they do check as I've noticed my luggage packed slightly different on several occasions. 

Not sure what help this gives other than a confirmation that someone checked your luggage."
Very true
I came here just to make sure Phish Food was at the top of the list. That flavour is life-changing.
"Their import for their bank transactions can be extremely slow. At least it always has been for me. Personally, all of their features can be replicated in a less pretty version in Excel but otherwise I do like the tool but probably wouldn't pay to use."
Yep. I live in BC.
"If we tell you there's a surprising ending, **it won't be surprising**."
"You have great taste, excellent list."
