Brave. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn’t use if to be honest.
"See, I bought the m1 ipad pro thinking it might last me longer than, say, a refurbished ipp 2018 from apple. With the student discount, I really paid around 850 for the ipad so not that big of a difference compared to the 2018 model."
Ok that’s good to know! I will try to get a sample of the current version. Now I’m curious to test out Dent de Lait - thank you!
It works. There’s a known patch and it’s just an Mterm command.
Self servicing!
Free grammarly plugin + Hemingway app. I read aloud if needed.
"Well some people did point out the IP sniffing out of the box without internet being preconfig which I suppose is a solid reasoning. I just feel like  again a few lines in terminal thatt can be achieved but for some even my self included, you gotta start somewhere. I was ""wrong"". I'm not super versed in Kali. I do use Debian mostly. Have touched Kali. but as others posted its probably some script kiddies in Asia who watched MR Robot."
"AD was Peterson's nickname far before Aaron Donald, so you could understand the confusion."
"Evian, because they're cleverly honest at how naivE you are if you pay them for their product."
"Ok, who's downvoting all the real and helpful answers? Seriously, why?"
"Yes,very sad that a good browser do that but is chinese,so,what i was expecting?"
There are recipes for cookie dough that are eggless.  David Lebovitz has a recipe in his ice cream book.
Love the colorway but I am still a 36 purist.  Just didn’t feel like a smooth transition between the foam and forefoot airbag IMO.
"Second. I've never been there, but one of the AFF instructors is someone I know and highly respect. He's got a great attitude towards safety and is a kind and patient teacher."
"i use to but i just go online now, i do play the sudoku in the TheSpec though"
"Bleu noir edt, parfum or extreme. ?

Also armaf sillage that good ? Pretty much avoided Armaf as I thought they smell very cheap…"
"[Baumgartner Restoration.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvZe6ZCbF9xgbbbdkiodPKQ)

I have lost count of how many hours i have spent just watching Julian restore old paintings. It is so incredibly satisfyingly to watch a damaged art piece slowly coming together. The comments tend to be hilarious too."
Just think of all the dragon breath you won't have when you are trying to score with a hot chick.
Which ever one leaves your buns the cleanest after wiping.
"I really don't want to invite a way for bad actors and bad hackers including government hackers into my home to spy on me in my home.

Pervert pedophiles already found a way to hack into smart tv's that have webcams and microphones that parents put in there children's bedrooms or there own bedrooms and living rooms. When the TV got hacked into the person started talking to the child or he could of kept silent for a long time watching before he started talking to her. You can cover up a camera but not a microphone or speaker. A microphone is just a speaker as you can use a small speaker as a microphone. That is what my uncle used to talk on voice chat with back in the late 90's early 2000s when he didn't have a regular microphone.

That is a big enough red flag not to have anything like that in a bedroom or even in any room of the house including all those assistance devices like Alexa and google home.

Anything that happens in those rooms or earshot of those rooms they can listen to and or watch if in range of the camera or microphone. The same thing happens with those so called smart security devices people use. Thieves were watching those people through their security devices. Are you naked at all in front of your TV or device? Well someone may be watching you through the camera and listening. Are you having sex with your girlfriend or wife? Well someone may be watching that too. People don't realize how unsafe these devices really are and that is the price people pay because they want convenience and luxury.

There is nothing secure that is a digital electronic device that connects to the internet. At least not forever. Eventually someone finds an exploit or cracks your password even if you didn't use the default password and settings. They may not brute force your password if you use a strong password but as soon as one person finds an exploit they are in and thousands among thousands of hackers including paid government employees like the NSA, FBI and other law enforcement, including other governments from other countries like North Korea, Iran, Russia and China to list a small few that are enemies or frenemies of our nation and are constantly looking for exploits."
Nestle in general sucks but Dasani just has a horrible taste to it
"I miss the metal tubes.  Mostly because the only place I ever had Tom's was at my grandparent's place and I have really fond memories of that toothpaste because I associate it with seeing them and remembering especially my grandfather who passed about 8 years ago.

Eventually as an adult I remembered that and looked at getting it, but they switched to a standard toothpaste tube (reading online this was after the brand was sold so it no longer independent).  It being the metal tube was a big part of what made it special to me as a kid and with it not having the metal tube it just didn't really bring back the memories."
"I've been to Bogota, all over Costa Rica, and Ramallah (West Bank), never touched an all inclusive, and never had a problem. Beggars in some areas will target you a bit aggressively if your in an area known for resorts and you look like you've come from one but it's not a big deal. Go out and enjoy a culture."
This right here. Big compliment getter for me during the summer months. Bummer they discontinued Perry Ellis M. Can't find it anymore and I wanted to try it so bad as well. Do you have that one too?
"Also YNAB can now pull from bank and cc accounts.  That's probably a big integration/maintenance undertaking which might have contributed to the pricing model change. It goes against the old philosophy of YNAB (which is a huge deal IMO) but after using both it honestly just makes maintaining my budget a lot easier.  

I don't get as far behind on getting transactions into the tool and it doesn't take long to sort everything out even if I'm pulling in 50 cc transactions.  That said, a downside is that there's less time spent on the reckoning and fallout from poor decisions (consider this if painstakingly entering your bad decisions is an important deterrent).

I think I'd recommend standalone YNAB for a new person who wants to really understand budgeting and I'd recommend YNAB online for someone who already understands and agrees with the YNAB system (or someone who is admittedly too lazy to enter transactions individually)."
