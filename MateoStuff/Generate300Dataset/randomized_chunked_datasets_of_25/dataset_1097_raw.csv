"If you think Knoebels is world famous, then that just proves his point."
"He was a great dad.  Very practical, taught me you could pretty much do anything if you had the right tools.  And he did just about everything.  Taught me the whole time, essentially taught me to be fearless. We played sports, watched sports...  Even my sister, who is a total girly-girl, refinished her outbuilding by hand, thanks to my father's teachings.  He died of an MI, but also had stage 4 colon cancer.  That is a very silent killer.  We had no idea until it actually perforated his intestines. Take care of yourselves, people."

Reminds me of Zyzz, reminds me of why I started working out, and it fills me with drive to go crush that next set of deadlifts or whatever it may be"
"Systems programming is quite different from web development, so none of these are what you'd work with day to day in your education (that doesn't mean they aren't worth knowing!). 

But the general case is that you should know the ubiquitous tools in your field (C for systems, Java for Android, PHP for web, C++ for game engines, etc.), but always continue learning new tech, and look for opportunities to use them for a net gain. For example, systems programmers and game developers might enjoy D or look forward to Rust, web devs might be happier with Clojure than PHP. 

So, yes, you should know the popular tools, but the new stuff is worth knowing just as much. Just learn to love learning, and your toolbox will organize itself!"
My mom has been looking for the original Joy of Cooking book from the 70s for a few years. I found one at a used bookstore & got it for her.
Yea I actually came to this thread to say that too. The part I enjoyed most about Aquaman was that it felt like an adventure. The movie moved across the world and felt really fun.
"I'll start off by saying that any of these factors can change based on where you are. This is just specifically for my city. In my experiences, Lowes is more geared toward the DIY homeowner while home depot is better suited for the professional. Lowes tends to offer better assistance for customers on what to get and how to do things, and they tend to be better in regards to organization and labeling. Price wise I find that they are pretty competitive with each other. One area where I find home depot tends to excell is in lumber. There lumber is almost always better quality than Lowes, being straighter and with less broken pieces on display. Home depot also often stocks a cart filled with reject pieces of wood that they will sell for 70% off, and if you only need a small peice of wood for part of a project you can often find a peice in this reject pile which can be cut down to be good enough for what you plan to use it for. So basically I go to home depot for my lumber, I go to Lowes for almost everything else, and I go wherever has the best online quoted price on very expensive purchases like appliances.

TLDR: it may vary by area, but where I am I find that it's best to go to home depot for lumber and Lowes for almost everything else."
"Thank you, Donny!"
I don't understand how Robinson is the 4th best receiver in the league.

So, like not ""all-inclusive"" at all.  I would much rather get free drinks and pay for food."

I've actually forgotten the taste of Coca-Cola without liquor in it. Tried it the other day. Tasted off.
You mean I'm not going to find papers on kalman filters and black holes dynamics on pubmed?
Terrible. Why is the ENTIRE state of Michigan just missing? Like what. What do the bigger vs smaller dots represent? No legend?
My answer is well. Smells great. Just one pump needed. Lasts me a long long time.

"[Clothesline Fresh](https://www.myperfectcolor.com/paint/384863-valspar-ci14-clothesline-fresh) by Valspar is one of my favorites!  Depending on lighting, it pulls different shades - sometimes more blue, sometimes more green."
Man I just dropped my biscuit from reading this lmfao
Source Code had a pretty killer twist.

Agreed! I sat through two PowerPoint presentations yesterday that made me want to make Tufte required reading for everyone who has to communicate data.
I've had peach/nectarine before too! They're all delicious
