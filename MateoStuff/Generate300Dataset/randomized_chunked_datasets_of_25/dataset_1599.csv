70733,best movies with a cool twist,"I’m a HUGE mystery/thriller/suspense fanatic and I hear the first Saw actually wasn’t that bad. I was able to resist it at first, but i’m starting to really feel like I should check it out. Does it REALLY not have a lot of gore, torture and people cuttung themselves. I KNOW there is one scene that deals with cutting a foot, but for someone who has never seen a torture porn and has no desire too, is this film too much? I would say the most violent film i’ve seen is Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and I was easily able to handle that. How does this one compare?"

37982,best Marvel movie,"Rewatching it right now just for that very reason! It felt like a 70s spy thriller movie but set in the MCU...outta left field, I wanna’ see a hulk horror/thriller. I mean I loved how we got to see professor Hulk and all (MCU does great fan service) but I would love to see some ultimates/old man Logan Hulk. I like the monster. AOU Hulk is my favorite Hulk"

32742,best vacation resort,"To be 100% honest, I actually preferred Las Vegas to Venice...not literally the fake canals at one hotel versus the real deal but just the overall experience. Venice was cool but I felt it was overrated compared to the mystique it garners in the travel community as a whole."
33103,best energy drink,"> ""as its concentration is regulated by the US, and banned in 100 other countries.""
And thus presumably only grandfathered in; the FDA is unusual in that it is very unwilling to ban anything that's already in wild. Potassium bromate is another popular one; it appears to be illegal just about everywhere except the US."

9856,best portable charger,"I have the Anker 20000mAh battery. Definitely recommend the brand. I don't use my phone much at festivals, but the 20k mAh battery made it all the way through 4 days of TML without needing a charge."
5456,best home improvement store,"Menards is probably a better resource if you have one near you.  They are like a more like a true hardware store in that they have EVERYTHING.  In a lot of departments they tend to lean towards house brands or lesser name brands but their pricing reflects the same.  You can literally build a house/building from the stock on the shelves at Menards. Their lumber selection is more like a lumberyard than the orange or blue guys by a mile but they don’t/can’t cut sheet goods for you.    Their appliance section isn’t nearly the same as the others but they make up for it in a myriad of other ways.  

One thing I have noticed with any of the Menards that I have been to is that if you ask where something is the person will stop what they are doing and walk you to the item on the shelf.  You don’t get ‘aisle 17’ as a response - EVER!  I’ve said before that I just needed a number and the response is pretty universal ‘I want to make sure for myself’  and they walk me there anyway."

69367,best major to study in college,"I majored in animation. If I could go back it would be one of two routes: Creative or not creative. 

Creative I would do web design. 
Non-creative I would do computer science. 

Ultimately, it doesn't matter how much you like what you do if your doing it 8 hours a day. I think web design is atleast something you can go home and have other hobbies. Animation you have to live. My friends who graduated web design have been able to move from job to job almost seamlessly. Unlike me or any of my friends with animation degrees.

I've always been good with computers and made websites and coded in my preteens. Just decided not to do it. I have no idea what I'm doing with my career right now maybe I should go back... Hah..."
