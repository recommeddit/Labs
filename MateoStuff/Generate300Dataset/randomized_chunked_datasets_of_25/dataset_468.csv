55753,"Rachel Aaron's **Eli Monpress** books might be up your alley.  Eli's out to be the best thief in the world, so he's always traveling around looking for stuff to steal.  He's trailed by a sort of magical FBI agent, who has jurisdiction to track him down basically anywhere he goes.  Eli's traveling companions include the best swordsman in the world (and his magic sword) and a tween-age girl who could possibly flip out and destroy the whole world.  Despite that, it's a pretty breezy, funny fantasy series that doesn't really dwell on the heavier side of what's going on.  Lots of adventure, lots of travel, and lots of fun.  I need to get to the rest of the series (I've read the first three) but I like it so far.",best action and adventure novel series

10686,"Although there are a few manufacturers where that trick doesn't work, zippers on bags are a constant nuissance anyway, usually that's what breaks first. Hard shells with latches is the way to go anyway. Sure, given enough time and the necessary tools, you'll get those open as well but if it's security who's stealing, there's not too much you can do about it anyway as far as the type of bag is concerned.

Travel film makes sense when going to some destinations because you can tell if the bag has been tampered with. It's not so much what has been taken from your bag but what has been added to it. Coming back from Colombia and the film has been removed? Off to customs and tell them, that's the kind of stuff that can make the difference between sleeping at home that night and a jail cell.",best suitcase lock

22340,"When I was a teenager, I met Neil Armstrong at a retirement ceremony that my dad brought me to.  It was at a museum and it was a private event.  There was time for everyone to wander the museum, and my dad saw Mr. Armstrong looking at one of the planes that my dad helped design. Nobody else around.  They struck up a conversation and Neil asked me questions about what I was studying and how I felt about the work my dad did (my dad worked on classified planes when I was much younger).  He seemed like such a gentle guy to me.  A bunch of other men suddenly joined as and started asking him for autographs, which he declined.  It seemed to snap him out of his happy mood, and he kind of shut down and walked away.  At that time I thought he was a bit of a jerk for not saying goodbye or anything, but I recently read about the hard time he had with fame, and I guess it makes sense.",best celebrity

Dont need a big engine. I dont want to pollute the city when I'm there, but I also dont want to charge every 400km's.

38719,"The Daily Mail is like the crazy racist old uncle of British journalism. You try to deny his existence all you can but it'll still come to family events and embarrass you shouting off how the immigrants are doing this and oxygen causes cancer. There are some members of your family that tolerate and even love him but you end up just trying to avoid him all evening and resisting the urge to punch him in the face.  Even the Times, the Daily Mail's father tries to distance themselves from him. 

Meanwhile you'll have some decent conversation you can understand with your cousins, The Guardian, Independent and Financial Times. Sometimes even your sister The Economist will show up and your estranged brother Private Eye sits in the corner judging everyone. 

Meanwhile your grandmother The Daily Express is still in mourning for Princess Diana and will be sitting with a drink telling you stories of Diana you've heard a thousand times.

15380,"Birch trees. We had one in our garden and I often sat in said tree as a kid, learning to climb, making up stories, daydreaming. I loved that tree. 

It fell down two years ago. It was a strong autumn thunderstorm and the birch fell down with a crashing sound, just along the house - just a tiny tilt in direction and it would have hit the roof. It lay there, reaching up to the street.

I went outside to look and was so shocked that I broke down crying. Then I grabbed a saw and went outside in the rain and cut its branches, its arms in order to at least save my bike that had been standing next to it and was now buried. I cut my finger but the death of my tree was more painful.

Firefighters had to come and cut us a way from the house to the street, chopping my tree in half. 

We saved its wood and will likely use it this winter.",best tree for the garden

31506,"Stayed there for a week on our honeymoon and would have to agree! Getting there was a different story. Direct flight to Dubai where we stayed a few days. Definitely don’t recommend spending any time there. Then a flight to male, followed by a puddle jumper and finally a boat to get there. On the way there it’s all very exciting. On the way home, it was the day that would never end. But that hotel is definitely in my top places I’ve ever stayed. Others that I can think of that we really enjoyed were Qualia on Hamilton island where we got engaged and the rosewood in Los Cabos with a swim up patio.",best hotel to live in
