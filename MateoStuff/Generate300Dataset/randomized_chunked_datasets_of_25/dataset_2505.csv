31619,best hotel to live in,"I’ve stayed at some pretty nice hotels through work trips. I liked Baur au Lac in Zurich the best. Didn’t necessarily have super impressive amenities, but it has exceptional service and has been part of some significant moments in history (I had lunch in the same room where FIFA officials got arrested in 2016 on corruption charges lol)"
10560,best suitcase lock,"I recently shipped 50 lbs of possessions via UPS and it cost $100, so not really cheaper than checking a 50 lb suitcase. Though amtrak does have some good deals on transporting stuff if you're willing to drop it off and pick it up from your closest amtrak stations."

3619,best college for research,"Population of France: 67 millions.
Population of Paris: 2 millions. It grows to 12 millions if you add the whole urban area.

No matter how you do it, it cannot be 30%."

54866,best water filter,"Yes, activated carbon is good at removing organic compounds, however it is not good at removing compounds such as metals and ions at all.

Brita filters used to only employ activated carbon.  The main purpose was to remove chlorine to make the water taste better.  It does have an added health benefit of removing halogenated organic compounds and other toxic byproducts of chlorination.  It does adsorb some arsenic, but not very efficiently at neutral pH.

I believe most Brita-type water filters now use a mixture of activated carbon and ion-exchange resin.  If you crack one open, you can see the black stuff which is activated carbon and little balls (usually green and yellow) which is the ion-exchange resin.  This is more effective at removing metals and ions.

Of course, most people neglect changing the filter, which defeats the whole purpose.  In fact, some studies have shown that ion-exchange resin tends to leach adsorbed ions at a high rate once it becomes saturated.  Additionally, bacteria and fungi can grow on the activated carbon and release endotoxins that can make you sick or cause chronic inflammation.  If you don't maintain your filters, you are better off drinking straight tap water."
40867,best instrument to play,I play the clarinet.... draws in all the boys!  :/ .......
64786,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Skip Arigato, the better sushi is Shintori.

There's a pretty good Korean BBQ place called kimchi on old state.

For mexican food, there's Santo mezcal or for more legit Mexican, la super rica or el buen gusto.

The good lion is my absolute favorite place for cocktails.

Enjoy!"

1304,best ice cream flavor,Have you tried Blue Bell Cookie Two-Step? Cookie dough in cookies and cream ice cream. It will change your life.
72035,best movies with a cool twist,"Empire Strikes Back, obviously"
47160,best state to visit in the United States,"My top cities would be:

San Francisco: Amazing food & beer, beautiful, lots of culture and a football/baseball team.  Gorgeous weather and lots of fun to be had.  Take the BART or rent a car and go out to wine country.  One of my favorite places, ever.

Washington DC/Baltimore:  I'm lumping them together because they ae so close.  Both have a lot of historical sites to see.  Spend a day in the museums, landmarks, and monuments in DC and then stop in Baltimore the next day.  You can see the Redskins play football or the Nationals play baseball, but Baltimore's teams are ""better"".  Camden Yards is considered one of the most beautiful ballparks in the states, and the Ravens are the home football team (Anyone who lives or has lived in Baltimore is crazy about the Ravens).  Check out Fells Point/Federal Hill, Mount Vernon, and the touristy stuff at the Inner Harbor.  

Chicago: a bitch in the winter, but it's another big, beautiful city with tons of nightlife, history, and excellent restaurants (Chicago style pizza and hotdogs).  In the summertime there's an awesome beach to spend time playing volleyball or just relaxing.  If you go there, find time to get a heavy metal burger at Kuma's Corner.  You won't regret it.

People say lots of good things about NOLA, but I've never been there.  I hear it's worth a visit.

I'd recommend seeing the national parks out west & the Grand CAnyon.  Awe inspiring if you are into nature.

As for Barbeque, I am partial to Carolina style BBQ."
58583,best cologne,"Cologne is great value - It seems incredibly expensive per mL, but you'll go through it quite slowly. Find a brand you like and pay for it, but don't simply go for the discount shelf.

If you decide to put aside your $20 limit, which I suggest you do, L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent is a popular and well-loved sent"
24241,best anime,"It depends on your definition of ""most acclaimed.""  If it means ""anime that received the most praise,"" I think it makes sense to skew toward older anime.  Evangelion has been receiving praise for 26 years.  Attack on Titan has been receiving praise for 8 years.

If that doesn't make sense to you, you can just look at the top anime of each decade, instead of comparing different decades to each other."

5426,best home improvement store,"It 100% depends on the management.  I used to always shop at Lowes, friendly staff, good organization.  They they opened a Home Depot close by.  Friendlier staff, better organization, better all-round.  Now I've moved to a new location the nearby Lowes is the better store...."
66652,best soccer team in the world,be a fan of the Italian national team or Liverpool (Balotelli's club)
