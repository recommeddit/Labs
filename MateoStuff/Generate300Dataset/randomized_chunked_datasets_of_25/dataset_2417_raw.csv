Listening to Shelby Foote tell stories and anecdotes is a real treat that never gets old. RIP.

"Weeping Willows. As a child I would always run up to a branch, jump on it, and try to swing back and forth. It never really worked out, but young me still loved them and tried again every time."
"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned To Pimp a Butterfly and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. No one in Hip-Hop so far has attempted to create albums which are more artistically ambitious than these two.

But then again I'm 2010s head so there's definitely bias in my picks. Illmatic, The Infamous, Ready To Die, Madvillainy are very strong contenders as well."
"I began playing video games on a PS2 when I was a young kid, despite now being an exclusive member of the PCMR (though I do use Dolphin, and PS2 and PSX emulators).

My favorite games were Kingdom Hearts, Sly Cooper series, Crash Bandicoot series, Jak and Daxter series, Spyro series, and the Ratchet and Clank series.

I also owned Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, which I loved so much and I would always play that with friends when I could invite them over *reminisces*. 

You also seem to forget Shadow of the Colossus, which I'm sure many people would say is an amazing PlayStation game.

Upvoted you because you not only reminded me of my childhood, but because I can relive amazing gaming moments with emulators.

Praise you, brother.

EDIT: Silent Hill 2 if I recall correctly is EXTREMELY difficult to find for PC. I'm not sure about Silent Hill 3, because I have only bothered with 2 (Heard Silent Hill 2 is the best of the series).

EDIT 2:
You actually do have Shadow of the Colossus, albeit the HD remake on PS3."
"There is only one all-inclusive resort in the US and it is not oceanfront. It’s actually on a river in Florida. 

Is there a reason you are limiting your choices to within the US?"
one of my all-time favorites!!!
"I've attached an Amazon link to the physical one I use for everything.
You can also use an app like color harmony(free in the play store) or just use a Google images result.

"But not number 1 good, definitely top 5 though"
"Books and Scotch. You, sir, know how to live."
"I mean, we all shit on em for being the poster boy for old people candy, but we all know they're the shit.  Peer pressure a motherfucker"
Thanks for the explanation effort!
Doing this will risk the wrath of a parent defending their little snowflake.
Because you're not supposed to talk about it
Cedar. That smell. Oh sweet baby jesus the smell.
Shh....Malwarebytes
">use a key switcher.

What is that? Have any links to some?"
Do you have it? If so does the quality come true and crisp? I've seen comparisons and they are very similar to the C922 etc
I'd be happy with the messy code if you're happy to share. Totally understand if you'd prefer to wait until you've cleaned it up though. But would definitely like to see it up on Github or something.
Can you post a pic? I just can't picture an orange room being nice and inviting
Any suggestions for 2-1s that can handle medium gaming? (1000-1300CAD)

"Damn you right as fuck, just changed it and it’s a lot closer to the glide when I first got it. Any suggestions for mouse feet that stay consistent? I’ve bought some cheap tiger arcs but it appears as tho they change quite a bit over time"
