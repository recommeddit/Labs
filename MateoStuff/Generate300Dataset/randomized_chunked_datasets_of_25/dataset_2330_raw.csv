This is incredible. I'm so happy to know that he's a good-hearted person. Makes me love his books ever more (which I already did a lot).
"iRacing.  Yeah it's expensive... but it's the best organized multiplayer community for sim racing.  There's really nothing that matches the quality of competition found in iRacing.

EDIT: To note for OP... 100% NASCAR licensed, with the only official NASCAR sanctioned eSport league (if you're good enough to qualify)."
"I live in Arizona, down in the low desert near Mexico.

Breakfast burritos are a *must* down here.

My favorite place in town is a little hole-in-the-wall called Stan's.  It's a convenience store with a kitchen and tables in the back.  Everyone knows about it and they serve a few hundred burritos every day.  They work their asses off.

I always get the supreme.  That has eggs, cheddar cheese, refried beans, potatoes, and chunks of bacon.  It's not broken up pieces of thin bacon, it's more like chunks of ham.  They're big and one in the morning will keep you feeling full all day long.  Cooking is pretty straightforward - the eggs are scrambled and the potatoes are fried in a skillet.

What you could do is make up the basic ingredients and knock off five or six burritos on a Sunday, then refrigerate or freeze them so you only have to cook once a week."
"I LOVE BASKIN' ROBBINS. That being said, do you know the recipes of the flavors? And what's the least ordered item on your menu?"
"Lol silly, just put the knife in your checked bag."
"Joe Namath also: *""I just wanna kiss yoouuuu""*"
"It's OP, sooo..."
The train scene goat don't @ me
I LIVE THERE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
So you like handling the stick?
"I do have Cloud Core, MH751, Game One and MH670. 670 is the worst among these imo. I had Cloud Flight for a while it was better sounding, but comfort was worse."
"Haha that’s a cool atmosphere though, also I play better when I can’t see my surroundings, I can zone in"
Haha
"Funny, up in Central Jersey  when we had Verizon it was near perfect.  We have T-Mobile now (company supplied) there are dead spots galore.  

Otherwise they were pretty equal as far as speeds customer service etc in my experience."
"Sure thing, decided to share my relevant copypastas as well in the edit."
"Yes let's not have any difference in opinions. Giants fans with LT, browns fans with Jim Brown. 49ers fans with Rice. Patriots with Brady. No sir let's just /thread it here folks."
"No no no. You microwave it, but while it's microwaving you heat up a skillet with a bit a butter in it. Then you toss the slice in the skillet and crisp up the crust. If you're into it, flip the slice over after the crust is crisp and fry up the cheese a bit. Fantastic."
"My wife and I straight up hate code names duet

Just such little room for creativity. No drama. Boring"
"SoftBank is the worst. It's expensive, and the reception is the worst on the island.  If you get an iPhone with them, it is locked for life too. Fuck them."
"favourite book, is a hard one. but my favourite author has definitely gotta be saffron kent. i can’t get enough of what she writes!"

"Two years ago, my stepsons (were 13 and 15) ordered me a cashemere sweater in baby blue with hearts all over it.  I love hearts, blue, and cashmere.

I love the sweater so much that I only wear it to bed as a snuggly sleeper. I can't stand the thought of getting food or drink on it so I don't risk it by wearing to special occasions. The boys asked about it once and I explained my reasoning to them, and they hugged me because they truly understood my message. 

I am 5 months pregnant and I will probably wear it at the hospital to keep me warm."
"Hey, thanks for that!"
Usually I have problems with these lists but I actually agree with this one pretty well done.
"I came into data science less than two months ago, but I can recommend a few things from my experience so far.

* NoSQL technologies: I'm working with a lot of graph databases (try Neo4J) and MongoDB.
* SQL - [Try this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sams-Teach-Yourself-SQL-Minutes/dp/0672321289)
* Work on your 'storytelling', or in other words, learn to explain the results of your analyses in a way that your client will actually understand and in a way that they can actually see the value in what you are doing. i.e. will it make them money? Perhaps get into making good visualisations - I have been tinkering with D3JS




Getting a Big Data Job for Dummies - don't worry about the title, it turned out to be an excellent book for me."
