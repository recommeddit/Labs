64050,"well the site isn't free atm...you have to check it daily to see when it's free.  Then when it's free, you spend a few hours downloading everything that you need until you're caught up as they are a relatively new site with not many books.

So you want to ge tinto a pattern as when they go free, you snag books you can't find anywhere else.

And I don't know if the site will ever go free again...but if you judge by the past, they will and quite often.",best place to pirate audiobooks reddit

Danny Devito. He bought *personalized* gifts (i.e. a nice juggling set for a for a person who he only talked to once that happened to mention he was an amateur juggler) for all the production assistants on set.

Al Pacino. Had dinner with him and he was intense about his latest project but also super nice and genuine.

Alan Cumming. Had dinner with him and he was hillarious, down to earth and a blast.

John Lithgow. Coached my girlfriend's basketball team. Awesome dad and person. Great coach.

Not so nice: Mariah Carey... enough said.",best celebrity

56644,"The monitors I looked at recently emphasized the 4K G-SYNC stuff.. and appeared to have 144Hz (which some people were overclocking to higher refresh rate), but I couldn't find anyone specifically saying that the 4K resolution could run at 144Hz.

I've seen the latest news about a couple $2000 4K ""HDR"" (i.e. ~384 backlight regions and high brightness) 144Hz G-SYNC displays that are supposed to come out this summer - right about now. The article emphasized the ""HDR"" part though, so it fit with my understanding that 4K displays with some 144Hz capability (although unclear if available when running at 4K res) exist. I wish publications and specs would be more clear on what things AREN'T rather than just what they are, but such is the nature of marketing.

I'm aware of the difficulty in rendering things fast at high res. Honestly, I'd probably get the biggest kick out of seeing my mouse cursor movement being smooth as silk, and hardly game. Pretty dumb I guess, but I used to have that on CRT so I kinda miss it.

Update: I think you're right - I think the displays I'd been looking at weren't 4K 144Hz displays. Now I notice that in some online stores, various submodels (i.e. different res and refresh rates) are grouped in the same major model page, and get the same reviews shared across the various submodels. It created a confusing situation where someone seemed to be confirming 165Hz overclocked refresh rate on a 4K display.. but that was actually for a 1440p sibling model (whereas the 4K model was max 60Hz despite G-SYNC). Reviewers apparently got the cool new 4K 144Hz displays a couple days ago, but I'll skip those since $2000 is a bit much for me. I won't consider going beyond around $1000.",best desktop monitor
