34292,best NFL player,"This is the dumbest narrative ever from fans.

In the last few years Rodgers has had a top 3 O-Line, very good RBs and below average receivers (Adams is a top 5 receiver but the rest are a meh so it evens out). That's literally no different to what Lamar Jackson had in his MVP season and I don't think anyone would say we failed to provide him good surrounding talent that year.

For some reason people on seem to look at receivers, despite the fact that Rodgers himself and many other QBs have said they'd much rather have a good O-Line than good receivers. We don't constantly hear about how little Wilson or Ryan had to work with even though their O-Lines have been bad."
56016,best action and adventure movie,"I remember hearing that Spielberg and Ford never liked the plot ideas Lucas had for that movie, and didn't want to do it, which is why the movie took so long to finally get made. Lucas wouldn't budge though, and eventually the other two decided that if they didn't do what Lucas wanted then the movie would never get made, so they grudgingly agreed to it."
5712,best programming language for web development,"I would add nodejs, Linux, some popular js frameworks, postgres, and some popular nosql dbs, and possibly Java or Erlang for the back end."

26329,best politician,"Wouldn't they have to have some sort of cause to get the records?  Maybe if the accused party needed proof to back up his claim of whatever he was doing (besides cheating), then the accuser could use those statements. But I don't think that they could just take the records because they need that evidence to prove infidelity."
36116,best alcoholic drink,Why are there laws that prevent/limit the sale and purchase of copper mugs? Awesome drink by the way.
37648,best Marvel movie,I still don’t get why Collider put First Avenger as the best movie

**Great:**

* Beyond the Sun
* Bonfire
* Hansa Teutonica: Big Box

* The King is Dead (2ed)
* New York Zoo
* Under Falling Skies

**Meh:**

* Fort
* Pan Am

EDIT: Anno 1800, The Cost and Paris are probably the only games I've missed that I'm particularly keen to play."

14983,best romantic novel,YES!!!!!!!!!!
68195,best science fiction novel,"In no particular order...

- Void Star by Zach Mason
This was the best book I read last year. Reminded me of the first time I read any William Gibson. Smart writing. Surprised I don’t hear more about this book.

- Beacon 23 by Hugh Howey

A fairly short book, you can read it in one sitting. Discusses loneliness and depression while working in essentially a lighthouse in space.

-  Wool by Hugh Howey

Just an overall fun and great read. The world of the Silos come alive. I thought the whole trilogy was fantastic. 


- 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke 

One of the first books I read for pleasure. Got me hooked onto sci-fi back when I was in school. An absolute classic I’d recommend anyone to read.


- The Forever War by Joe Haldeman

This one played with some really interesting ideas. Space travel, time dilation. Going to fight a war, only to come back and everyone you’ve ever known is dead and the world has progressed hundreds of years...

Bonus- some may not call it sci-fi but I loved the Blue Ant Trilogy by William Gibson 

I just ate these books up. William Gibson is just such a fun author. So much packed into his books."

12515,best gifts for mom,Death. She died giving birth to me.
29872,best money managing app,"YNAB looks more user friendly than Mint.. however I use mint and find it to be very useful.
I use the budget tab in Mint and have all my bill dates set on my calendar app on google so i know exactly when I have to pay what bills. since i get paid every 2 weeks i know at least how much money i cannot spend... on top of that i pack lunch and cook dinner so the going out expenses is usually just friday to sunday..
i think budgeting might seem hard but it is easy to cut down spending when you cook lunch and dinner instead of spending 100+ a week on food
you can also set goals in mint where it will tell you how much you should put aside per month."
