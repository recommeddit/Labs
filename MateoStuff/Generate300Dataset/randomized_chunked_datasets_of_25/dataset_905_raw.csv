"Exam question: ""Make a O(n) sorting algorithm that works on a list with an unknown range of elements"" THAT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE YOU'RE ASKING ME TO SOLVE THE P/NP PROBLEM ON A 50 MINUTE EXAM YOU DICKHOLE"
"Some weird responses here. If money is a concern then the iPhone 11 will meet all your criteria and will be officially supported by Apple for at least four more years, although will probably last you longer. If price isnâ€™t a concern then youâ€™ll want to wait until the new iPhone comes out next month and buy any one of those with the newest chip on day one. It will likely be officially supported for around 7 years, but you could probably squeeze 10 years if youâ€™re content with no security updates after ~7."
"Man those kind of gifts can just destroy me emotionally. When I was younger I was a real nerd and I would help my classmates study because I just had a really good time making study packs and explaining what they needed to know and I felt like it also helped me study. I had a couple friends who really needed some help and I spent ages with them studying for their test.

One of the girls invited me over to hers to hang out so we got in the car but she said we needed to drop something off at the other girls house. She opened the door and they both just turned to me and said OK so we lied we just really wanted to give you this and she handed me a Xena warrior princess box set which I didn't even know they remembered I liked. Instantly started crying at the gesture, it was such a pretty box, too. Thing is I was also looking to buy it but I couldn't find it cheap enough to ship where I was! I'm still friends with those girls a decade later."
Gran Turismo 4. I haven't really played another racing game since that one that I actually enjoyed. I haven't owned a console in almost a decade so I haven't been able to try the more recent games.

"DSLR is the obvious choice, but if you don't have that kind of money like me, I use this Vitdae webcam and I've been really impressed with the quality especially at this price point. With good lighting and dialing in your settings/xsplit it's really great [https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Vitade-Streaming-Conferencing-Computer/dp/B07VW6Q9F7/ref=sr\_1\_67?dchild=1&keywords=webcam+with+ring+light&qid=1619733959&sr=8-67](https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Vitade-Streaming-Conferencing-Computer/dp/B07VW6Q9F7/ref=sr_1_67?dchild=1&keywords=webcam+with+ring+light&qid=1619733959&sr=8-67)"
All the hipster frameworks... Not everybody have a luxury to find a job in their area that utilize those.
"I don't own Rayban glasses, and am from LA, so I cannot offer any insight to your specific question.  The only thing I can say is that almost nobody uses glass in their glasses any more.  Just about everything is[ cr39 polycarbonate \(plastic\)](https://www.zeiss.com/vision-care/en_de/sunlens/products/lens-material.html).  If you are careful you can find [Glass lenses](http://www.zappos.com/sunglasses/CKzXARCq2QE6AvsP.zso). I find in stores Maui Jim are about the only ones people cary with glass lenses, and they are quite a bit heavier."

"Met Matthew McConaughey at a subway in Ohio when he was staying in my hometowns fancy treehouse hotel, walked up to him and was like are you Matthew mcconaughey and heâ€™s like yeah, and I said cool, so he said you want an autograph and I said I guess, so he signed a subway napkin for me."
"Just today my Siberian Husky Riley had a really lovely interaction with a 8mo old baby. We met these people at the park and they said their son likes dogs and asked if he could meet Riley and I said sure. They put him on the ground right next to Riley and she laid down in front of him and gave him very small gentle kisses on his face. She let him touch her nose and muzzle and ears, she definitely knew she needed to be gentle kind and patient with him, it was very sweet. Obviously I canâ€™t vouch for all huskies but from my experience and from what I know about the breed they tend to be really good with kids!"
"By disqualified do you mean that employers pass the option of hiring you because you are ""overqualified"" (read: too educated) for the position?

Until I had a friend get me a job (connections are everything, seriously), so many jobs either told me I had too much education (traditional in-class 4-year university) or not enough experience.  I may have been better off not getting a degree and just working for a few years."

I went to UCSB in the early 2000s and now wouldn't have a shot at getting in.  Crazy.
"Along those lines, I'd say check out Bright Sun Films. Mainly his ""Abandoned"" series."
Thank you so much. Picking a laptop has always been a daunting task. Youâ€™ve made it so much easer. I appreciate your help.
No. I have bad teeth due to a variety of reasons so I have to take extra good care of my teeth. I have found the flosspik to be very effective.
