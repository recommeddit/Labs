59199,best perfume,"Eau Flirt by Harvey Prince...discontinued and had to get my hands on a bottle through ebay but I get so many compliments and I think it's made to be an attractant (hence the name). 

Also have tried different perfumes with pheromones to see if there is a difference in people's reaction. I noticed one by Raw Chemistry that tends to get people's attention :)"
35753,best alcoholic drink,"I wish mine was like that, after the gauntlet I remember some beers and several more rumple minze shots, with people other than my friends buying them. Woke up the next day to my roommate cleaning my vomit out of his car telling me to hurry up for our golf tournament.  Somehow it was one of the best rounds of golf I ever played."

51812,best iphone case,"NGL, when I saw a reply from /u/PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES in my inbox, I was bracing myself for something â€˜spicyâ€™... but turns out the link was just to a phone case"
69307,best major to study in college,Have you ever dealt with some real AI/CI material? The titles are fancy but have you looked *under the hood* what is it about? I'm just asking because AI is something I would never want to get in as a CS student.
33521,best electric car,"They all had the same choices and options, it was a race after. hvac use wouldn't have changed the outcome."
37837,best Marvel movie,"""The fight scenes are magnificent (Lagos, Steve & Bucky in the apartment, the airport, Steve & Bucky vs Tony)""

You're kidding right? No MCU hand-to-hand fight comes close to what was show in Shang-Chi, primarily because shaky-cam techniques and quick cuts have unfortunately become part of the norm, which really results from the lack of a martial arts background and inability by the producers to hire established fight choreographers. Simu Liu is now the only actor in the MCU with a martial arts background, which is why you could see a lot of the fighting."
6502,best Netflix documentary,"This was definitely one of my favourites, I for sure did not see it going where it ended up lol."
36529,best alcoholic drink,It's an emulsifier. In a nog or ale flip it'll make it smooth and creamy. In here it'll feel like a loogie in your mouth because it'll have curdled.

32337,best hotel to live in,"I used to work security at a country club. They had tiny, translucent stickers on their windshield and my job was to check for those stickers.

The gate was being replaced, and I almost got run over with how many people refused to stop so I could check their sticker.

Many times I got the ""Don't you know who I am"", but I never knew who they were."

54684,best water filter,I have a soma water filter that I like a lot. You can also essentially subscribe to them sending you a new filter every couple months so that you don't have to think about it. And the pitcher itself is nice.
47401,best state to visit in the United States,"One of the trips I'll be planning around August-September which is when I'll catch a game

Last generation it was pc,ps4 and the 3ds back when the ps4 still had exclusive games,and I was able to softmod both consoles,so no time bomb for me."
54671,best water filter,A leaky aerator is $10 to replace. There is an O ring at the filter base that needs to be replaced every couple of years that could make the housing leak. The new O ring is $2 to replace.
