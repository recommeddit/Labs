54425,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Honestly those two cover most everything outside of super speed like shidenkai.   They were my first two and I only kept going cause...I have problems lol.  But otsu v2 is basically a good mix of the two and more of a plush surface.  It's nearly as fast as hien and close to the control of zero, but zero has more control and hien has more speed if you want one of those categories to be ""maxed out""."

22105,best celebrity,"I met Gary Cole at a fundraiser.    Very cool guy.  


At the autograph signing/photo part of the event, I whipped out an Initech mug.  He laughed so hard.  A lot of guests at the event were confused about it, as they had no idea the reference.   

His reply was the best:   “Sometimes you take a part, not because it’s interesting, but that you have to make a living.   I never thought that role would have such a deep cultural impact!”"

38508,best newspapers to read,"I read Baltimore's City Paper every week (or as close to it as I can get). It's an independent free paper with a focus on city news, local music and arts and has awesome columns like Savage Love and comics like Maakies. Their website is pretty cool, but it's awesome to be able to leaf through something now and then."

57185,best water brand,">Where was I lying? Even your inexpensive bottled water is massively more expensive than your tap water. It's easy math.

Because I'm paying for the bottle, not the water. Making something for 5 cents and selling it for 12 cents is normal markup, the cost of the water doesn't even affect it.

And yeah, some gas stations might sell the same bottle for $1 or more but they have the overhead of running a store along the side of the road and can charge more for convenience than the grocery store can. It's the same reason they can sell a hotdog for $2 when an individual one costs about 10 cents for 5 cents worth of meat. 

It's a shame that Fiji and Flint both have shitty governments that won't fix their water pipes, but that's basically irrelevant for a discussion regarding bottled water. Neither place is running out of clean water, they just have decided not to pump it to their residents. The residents should rise up and do something about it, I know I would."

17041,best iOS game,"Six Ages is the same vein as KODP. The game is a little more streamlined and less obtuse. But other than that it’s more of the same. It’s an entirely different culture this time however, not the Orlanthi. The events, gods, etc are all unique and new too. If you liked KODP, you’ll like 6 ages"
52026,best iphone case,it actually isn’t bad! don’t notice it.
4408,best text editor,"meh, it's really a matter of preference I suppose. In my opinion, by using 'jk' my fingers are already right there to take me out of insert mode (although caps lock isn't a very far stretch either) and if I ever \_do\_ need to type in all caps (for whatever reason, but I do use vim for more than just writing code...so I guess it's a possibility although rather unlikely), I still can use caps lock in insert mode. Also, I only type in english, so there's never a  time where I'm typing a 'j' followed by a 'k' but I suppose that  might be an issue in other languages. The point is that really just mapping escape to something that works for you is faster than hitting escape every time you want to leave insert mode."
22100,best celebrity,"Tom Holland! The most famous and the nicest celeb I’ve met so far. 

I’ve never seen someone say a bad word about the guy, he’s just genuinely sweet. Which is awesome considering his long history of acting and he’s only in his early 20s. 

Some lesser known celebs, the guys from the band Her’s. I met them at a show they played a few weeks before their accident that caused their deaths. They were the sweetest 2 guys I’ve ever met. My heart aches thinking of them <3"
