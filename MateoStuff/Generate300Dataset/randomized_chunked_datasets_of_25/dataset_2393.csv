FT (Santa Catalina) is about a mile from campus and surrounded by construction.  Manzanita and San Raf are on the edge of campus and quiet and not very social."

39027,best web browser,"Stick to the built in chromium edge browser. It's a high class browser with very good startup and performance. The RAM usage and CPU usage is far lower than Chrome (not the lowest but still the best). For privacy, it has built in privacy and tracking blocking measures which you can customize to your heart's content. Brave does use less CPU and RAM and has better privacy options, but I'd stick with edge and not waste any storage downloading extra browsers for Windows 10."
