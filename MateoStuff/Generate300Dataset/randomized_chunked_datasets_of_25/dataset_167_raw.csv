"RHEL in production, CentOS in dev.

Why?

Then your company can pay for RHEL to offload some liability. The software is certified for certain hardware too. Enterprise apps are built and certified for RHEL.

It makes corporate types happy.

Why CentOS in dev? It's RHEL without the licensing. If you have enough cash, just get RHEL so external vendors don't complain when testing products and try to blame CentOS."
"Pharmacist Here. Ditto what the doc said. Rest and fluids are your best friend. 


I'll add Tylenol ( acetaminophen) though, for fever. (no alcohol with it)"
I feel had because i saw it right after Parasite and the vague similarities made me like Parasite less
"AT&T is miles ahead of Verizon and T-Mobile in Western Mass, so much so that I only know three people who don't use AT&T, and one of them is me, and the other two work at T-Mobile."
"I'm not sure how I feel about this list. Half of the series you mentioned aren't on the list, include The Expanse and Bobbiverse which are pretty well known."
"Same. Axios is great too, but it's nice to only have to remember one API."

Chloe for sure! I’m 30F and I also love that my mom used to wear this one when she was my age :)

"Been maintaining something of a fantasy about moving to Canada over the last few years. The Internet situation is somehow worse than in the UK, I know that much"
"Upvote for this. Recommended by a gay ~~guy~~ salesman, approved by the girlfriend. This smells amazing.

Edit:  Redundancy"
Are we really gate keeping smoking weed now?
A Simple Favour (2018) rocked my socks off I always recommend this one because i think it went unnoticed at the cinemas but truly worth a watch
Maybe not the best book I've ever read but certainly the best author is Alexis Hall. His writing is just... something else. I cannot believe all that talent exists in one person.
Kailh Speed Pinks and Box Whites
"Considering you liked House of Cards and Fargo, I’d recommend Succession, a comedy-drama about the concentration of power in the hands of a wealthy family. The show has some beautifully profane dialogue, hilarious and intense moments (sometimes in the same scene)."
Which means they already know he's made other movies that they can check out. We don't need to tell them.
Or just pick a color that you like....
Oh there it is!
"I'm not really sure why this is ""controversial."" It's hard to judge how great a twist actually is when you didn't get to fully experience it yourself. I haven't even bothered to watch *The Sixth Sense* or *The Usual Suspects* yet because I had the twists spoiled for me."
"that team is top 10 easily, perhaps even higher. Sure only one scudetto isn't good enough but in europe they dominated and annihilated so many teams obviously other than that liverpool fuck up. Only Arsenal 02-06 have played more enjoyable football in my adult lifetime in my opinion."
"Alright, thank you, it's good to know it's worked for someone and on IOS 13"
"The original conception of the interstate highway system anticipated a true 'interstate' not inner-city set of roads. But local planners, when they got hold of it, had no qualms about blasting through the neighborhoods of the 'undesirables.'"
