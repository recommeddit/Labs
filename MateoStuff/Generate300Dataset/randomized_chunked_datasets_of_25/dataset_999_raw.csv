"Try GoogleCalendar! You can set up events to repeat on a schedule, as well as employ daily, weekly, and monthly views for all your events.

For the to-do list, I’d suggest Wunderlist. It is awesome!"
Yea because Brady's individual passing stats are totally pedestrian
"I love hamsters (But my partner doesn't :( ), amd yes; they aren't pets for kids.

They sleep when kids want to play, they play when kids want to sleep, and if you try and interrupt that cycle you get bitten. They're small and need to be treated with care, not as rough as little kids can be; if they're mistreated, they'll bite or run off and hide. They need to be regularly cleaned out and played with (During which time they may bite). They only live for a short time (After which they stop biting).

And, oh yeah, they bite."
"Out of those three, I'd go for Mint>Ubuntu>Debian. I think all of them do deliver what you require. Some software might not be available (like Adobe stuff), but you can use VM of windows, dual boot, or try to find unofficial ports to your Linux branch.
About looks can't tell you much, I am enjoying using KDE plasma customisation options."
I guess I'm the only person on the planet who actually enjoys candy corn.
"In my experience, the people who proudly and snobbishly look down on romance novels have never read a good romance novel. They're often the only places to find good queer rep. I don't read a tonne of it but I do love what I've read. 


I'm a big fan of Sarah Waters' books and I've been listening to The Magpie Lord by KJ Charles on audiobook (the whole series is fantastic). There is also this short story called The Cybernetic Tea Shop by Meredith Katz which I recommend constantly, I absolutely adore it and everyone needs it in their lives. It's short and there is no erotic element because they're both ace lesbians. 


Sidenote: I can't stand Call Me By Your Name, the age gap/paedophilia thing makes me super uncomfortable. There's too much of that in queer romances, those unhealthy power dynamics."

tl;dw: Leeroy is still dead after all these years, you res him, he cooks the rest of his chicken. You help him retrieve the pauldrons he wanted, and he joins your garrison."

I hadn't realized Deadpool was removed from Steam. Any particular reason?
I’ll give you an upvote for spending 40 minutes on a Reddit post. What’s your definition for upper class though? Premium?

"I have seen plenty of complaints about the lack of a dark ride, and the general lack of indoor areas at Cedar Point.  The bathrooms are also from like the 60s or 70s, they clean them but they look extremely old.  Both topics which are brought up to management during Q&A events with enthusiasts annually.  But Cedar Point still has a decent flat ride collection it’s mostly older but they have a good number of them.

Cedar Point and Magic Mountain are only really in competition online, and for a handful of coaster enthusiasts.  SFMM’s main competition is Knott’s, and then Disney and Universal."
Quality choice!
"Hipster Disneyworld is (or at least was until recently) The Woods, which is (was?) the bar hipsters went to with the intention of meeting someone and hooking up that night."
"Singaporean here.


Good:
safe - never have fear for your safety or property ever.
small - everything is near to each other because its just a city.
infrastructure - everything everywhere is nice. nice roads, nice buildings, nice internet.


Bad:
Expensive - most expensive city in the world. Price of motor vehicles and housing, especially.
Culture - the average Singaporean has a unique.. culture. But I guess this takes some getting used to just like every other country.


Would I recommend?

If you're wealthy, you will have fun here. Money talks, and Singapore is a good listener."
Legit no one can tell the difference outside of Reddit.
"Former English major here who does a bunch of writing-related jobs. There's lots of ways that you can make a writing job part of your life! The good news is that you can pair it with a variety of majors and figure out what's most interesting to you. You can write copy or materials for marketing firms, get editing gigs, teach writing, write articles, go the creative route, and so much more. Having a passion for writing is awesome AND useful."
"Just to add to the chorus, Desert is the better option. You have a lot more freedom of action. And better feeling of exploration.

Island to me feels tight, but is too simple to find the best action."
It'll take me a few days to read through all these... do you have a tl;dr for the hurried scientist?
No bueno for certain states.
"A good pillow. Granted, bedding can be unreasonably overpriced, but $20 pillows at Target are not awesome. Invest in a good pillow. You spend 1/3 of your life on it."
