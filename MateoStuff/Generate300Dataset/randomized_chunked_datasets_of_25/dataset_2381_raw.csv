"I log over 100 miles a month and swear by lunar glides... i've never had any structural injuries or issues, and never got a bad pair. maybe i'm lucky?"
Just in case anyone thought *tooth*paste was supposed to go on your anus instead of your teeth.
Awesome to hear. Fingers crossed.
"Like humans, cats need a hand to squeeze also."
Probably safe to assume that they are both in the top 10
Disappointment is free.
Oops...I meant what if.
"Signal and the noise and algorithms to live by were very good at expanding how I think about problems and how relying too heavily on data can be detrimental. As far as textbooks go, Elements of statical learning seems to be a high watermark amongst the DS community."
"Tom best Spidey, followed by Andrew.

Tobey best movies, but you know, Tom's had 1."
We should make our own list. This list isn't very good.
How did Lords of Waterdeep not make the list? That's one of my groups favorite when we only have 3-4 players.
The pumpkins are the best :)
Jack and OJ is extra manly if he brushed his teeth first.
"I grew up with both in my house.  Gross and humid summer weather, bone dry winter."

"Lincoln. The man was woefully unprepared for the job. He was an unexperienced, third tier candidate nominated by an infant party. One would doubt his ability to govern effectively in good times given the novelty of his party and slight resume, yet he gets elected amid the most catastrophic event in American history. He got the nation through the civil war with nothing more than intellect, reason, and good decision making. People don't really know this about Lincoln, but he was a chronic depressive prone to melancholy. The nation was on her death bed and Lincoln was able to overcome his personal demons and defficiencies to grind out a victory."

"Um, our economy depends on them. When the Air Force Base closed in my hometown the Canadians coming down to shop got us through it. Now it's one of the top micro-cities in the country and the only city to not only get back to where they where pre-base closing but to be doing better. They may be annoying, camp out for weeks at a time on the Wal-Mart parking lot, and inexplicably purchase shopping cart loads of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (I've seen this more times than I can count) but with out them it would no longer exist."
Can you suggest any games?
"Yeah the normal(non plus) Powerline cables are just regular TPE and not those nylon braided ones(those are the real stiff cables, cos stiff kind of = non-tangling), but they're still rated for 10k+ bends so they're durable enough. Good to hear :)"
"Jim Brown. Also, as unpopular as it may sound, Peyton Manning is a close second."
"Daily Mail is still the best paper regardless of what the liberals here and left wing tv personalities will say. I dont read it because of Littlejohn who is a massive cunt.

I read the i instead.

Guardian is absolute left wing trash."
I'm visiting this sub and now I want to go out and buy J'adore
"Ehh, that was played at my brother in law's funeral (yes I am completely serious), so it's probably a no for me."
