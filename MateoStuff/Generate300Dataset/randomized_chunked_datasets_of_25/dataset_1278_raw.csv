"They're teenagers. That's normal. You didn't do anything wrong. If anything, that's good because in their minds you're not interfering with the shit they want to do.

Edit: /u/A_Bigger_Douche pointed out that it's ""a normal part of child development which leads to the creation of their own independent identity."""
"The Office.

Particularly Seasons 2-7"

"Romance novels are my guilty pleasure. I actually hide two Tupperware totes in an extra linen closet. I enjoy historical romances.

My favorite author is Judith McNaught. Her Westmoreland series is my favorite. I know there is some controversy about “Whitney, My Love” promoting DV, but the books are really good."

I didn’t see an option for Do not Detect data types. I’m using Excel for Mac v 16.16.15, I’ll google around a bit and see if it’s hidden somewhere in my options. Thanks again for the lead!"
"Somebody already mentioned Mindhunter, but Manhunter was also excellent."

"Just keep LinkedIn and Github. That's really all you need for jobs. It's nice if you have a well-done personal site, but not really required."
"Those kind of space videos just tend to destroy my mind completely because it's just out of our brain's capabilities to actually even get a sense of how unbelievably enormous out universe is, and that there's no chance that we are alone. But we will never know in our lifetime, if ever."
Same. I fucking hated it.
"If you havent yet, do read American Gods as well ( definitely read before you watch the TV Series )"
