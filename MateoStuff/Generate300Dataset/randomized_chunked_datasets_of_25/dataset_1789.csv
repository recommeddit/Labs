44471,"I actually tried that before buying the blackout curtains.  I had two problems:

* It was hard to keep light from coming in through all the seams between the pieces of foil.
* There was a slight air flow even when the windows were closed, so the foil made a constant quiet crinkling sound.

I'm sure I could have made it work if I kept tinkering with it, but it seemed like it would be a big hassle.  That and it just looked cheap and messy.",best items under $100

62882,"Datacamp has the most solid collection of absolute-beginner to mid-level-but-not-in-depth content Iâ€™ve seen on data science to date. A lot of courses are taught by the people who created the popular packages theyâ€™re teaching you about. I recommend Rosalind more for a comparable self-learning collection for bioinformatics specifically though. I pay for Datacamp because Iâ€™m a big fan of the format for efficient bursts of interactive learning, itâ€™s super easy and kinda fun to blaze through a 4 hour course on the weekend on a topic I feel Iâ€™m not quite solid on. Is it suitable for deep dives? Hell no. Can it help you think about common problems in your field and jump-start your problem-solving kit when youâ€™re not yet senior level? Yeah, I think so.",Best Data Science textbook
