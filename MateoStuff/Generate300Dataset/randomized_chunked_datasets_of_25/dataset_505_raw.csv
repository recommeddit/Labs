"Ooh, really? What rank was it? That's exciting."
"Nothing crazy but the Skirvin in downtown OKC right after it reopened several years ago, or the Magnolia in downtown Dallas for a work trip."
"That's what Javascript is for. Your Javascript code manipulates your HTML, which gives the appearance of a dynamic page. 

Your HTML is generated by the back-end of the site, which you can write in whatever you please. Popular choices for backends include PHP, Ruby, Perl, and Python. More modern choices might be Scala, Clojure, Groovy, or even Haskell."
breakfast? or is it lunch that i usually wake up to? XD
"Finance. 

Classes in college are easy and the jobs pay VERY well. 

Cons. The jobs first out of college require a lot of hours"
"I got a BA in History, which I have never ever once used directly.  (I DO know how to rite gud, which is a useful skill, but not one that is particularly relevant in higher-paying fields.)  No ragrets, but if you gave me a time machine I'd go back and get a STEM degree.  Knowing what I know now I'd probably aim for something in the aerospace field.  I ended up there and have a MS in it now, but starting over again I wouldn't want to close some of the doors that having a BA does."
"What sounds more delicious? 

Maple Syrup?



Burt Reynolds?"
"Rx 5700xt user here, I'm not sure how comfortable I am recommending it. I'm an AMD fan, but since moving from the 1060 to the rx 5700xt I've been having issues left and right. Overheating, not performing well without uv, constant settings resetting, unresponsive black screen resulting me to hard restart PC, strange artifacts in some games, feels like it's not optimized well for games, driver updates don't help and sometimes brake more stuff. I wanna love it so, so bad and I still do, but I can't recommend it at its state, a card shouldn't bother you. It should plug and play, my 1060 did and I'm very confident the 2060 would aswell."
It's awesome to see Statistical Rethinking gaining popularity. I'm seeing more and more people mention it on Reddit. Are people also using more applied Bayesian analysis in industry as well?
"""Boss"" by Mike Royko is an excellent book that describes the life and career of the first Mayor Daley in Chicago.  Great, quick read if you are interested in a little Chicago political history."
Last time I drank Fireball I thought it gave me a concussion
"No, don't."
"I usually start with the NY Times on the front page. If none of the stories interest me (this rarely happens) then I just skip to the back for the Op-Ed (my favorite section). After that, I go to Arts and Leisure, then back to International and National news. Every once and awhile I will read the business. On Sundays, nothing beats the Week in Review with Frank Rich's column. His piece today about Rand and the Tea Party is a good read."
"This is an excellent detailed writeup and you've put a huge amount of work into it, so I dislike being picky, but I have a suggestion. I think you need a third use category for color-accurate photo editing/review. Although you mention ""good color reproduction"" in the section on panel types, I'm sure many readers would benefit from a summary on sRGB and AdobeRGB, and a list of the best 100% AdobeRGB gamut monitors on the market. (I know the tech details, but keeping up with the market offerings is tough!)"
"Venture forth, young bard and spread it yourself."
For now model O (fk1 shape) its 70 grams not really that much lightweight but still lighter than fk1/s1
"Elon Musk is not the genius that he is portrayed as. His ideas are what you get from an engineering undergrad. The actual intelligent people are not known outside of there specific field. (If you know the name Shannon, you know exactly what I mean)."
"Depends what you care about!

I need all-day events at the top of the widget, and iCloud calendar is the only program that works how I want."
Tough climate. It’s never really bone chillingly cold here or anything but 8-9 months of persistent drizzle limits the prime operation season to like June-Sept/October. I’m also not sure how it would fare as everyone is out on the trails/coast/mountains while the weather is nice. I’d love to see a larger park here than what we’ve got but I doubt we will ever see it. If there was a market for it I bet it would have been built by this point.
"I had guinea pigs when I was 10. Hated them. Shit everywhere, including in their food and water bowls. Peed on me when I out them in my lap. Boring as heck after the first few months. They basically just waddle around and aren't smart enough to do anything interesting. And squeak really really loud when they want something. Plus all that shit stinks so you're constantly cleaning out the cage. Worst pets ever."
"If you are on Sci-Fi, I recommend Anathem. It requires a big investment on your part early on, but I felt it was worth it."
"HA! Not available in my country! thanks, GEMA! Useful for once."
Okay now I know to stop responding. The troll came out of its cave
"I do this and rotate them.  


I was given 2 free mophie 6,040 mAh charges from Verizon and I just keep one charged and one in my bag.  Then I can swap out.  Each is good for 2 full charges.  So I can get 4 full charges without worry and they take far less time to charge.  

If I were to purchase my own? I’d go with Anker 8,000-1,100 range as I have there very old 20,800 mAh power bank and it is still going well after 4+ years of use.  But that one I relegate to long trips where I won’t have access to ANY electricity for 5+ days."
That book looks a lot more math-focused than Deep Learning with R. Deep Learning with R is more about explaining the intuition behind deep learning and about how to do it in practice with the Keras package.
