1299,best ice cream flavor,Fu*king vanilla. Yyyyyeeeeesssss!!!!!!!!!
4278,best text editor,"Oh, I love me some vim action too. I actually SSH into another machine so I can work in the command line (or just do it locally if I'm on my Gentoo installs) and it's pretty wicked awesome. <3 vim!

The issue I have with gvim/Vista isn't, I don't think, Vista itself -- it's the particular install on which I don't have admin access or persistent changes (literally I have to install some things every. time. I use them. It's fun!)"
73473,best battery bank,"Baseus F10W, it is 10000 mAh compact bank with fast wireless charging.

Also, Bolts Lab's the Bolt is great — similar size, but with suction cups to charge wirelessly more conveniently. However, looks like their website doesn't work now"

58772,best cologne,"Nice post that I agree with. My first real cologne that I picked and accepted as my scent was Rochas Man. I still use it after 4 years. Considering im 20 its a long time. 

Now funny story about a perfume being associated with your name... My close friends know how I smell however whenever they ask me what I use, I say its a secret. Kinda teasing them. A year ago a close girlfriend of mine started dating a guy, which coincidentally used Rochas. She made him change his perfume because he smelled like me and she felt uncomfortable about it.

She loves the scent on me, complimented to me about it many times before they got togather."
18110,best Kardashian,Yes that sounds about right lol
24256,best anime,"Seeing Made in Abyss on this list made my heart soar. It’s such an amazing anime, and one of the few that made me dive straight into the manga."
33255,best electric car,"It's not at all what you said, they've said it's standard with the big battery, not the $90k version."

68005,best science fiction novel,"I just read Seveneves as my first Stephenson book, and I loved it.  I obviously haven't read anything else by him, so they could all be much better, but between how good Seveneves was, and the fact Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Neuromancer are both already on the list, it seems fair to include a hard Sci-Fi end/ rebuilding of the world book on here instead of another cyberpunk touchstone."
3553,best college for research,"oh facts that does seem like a really good idea, thanks for suggesting it :)"
73794,best matte screen protector for ipad,Personally I think glass screen protectors are by far the best option. But a fold-over case makes them unnecessary on the iPad for me at least. Maybe if you wear jewelry or don’t want a case that folds to protect it it might be different for you.
24046,best anime,O.o there are new episodes? Awesome! Maybe Ginko will find out about his past before he became who he is.
39935,best Chrome extensions,"I will be messaging you in 6 hours on [**2020-08-11 22:45:25 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-08-11%2022:45:25%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/i7qom4/the_best_chrome_extensions_i_cant_live_without/g147z18/?context=3)

65414,best phone service company,I get unlimited for 20-25 so I’m happy (Verizon)
51138,best rap album,"I feel that it's a kind of limited viewpoint in today's age of the Internet. Maybe like twenty years ago when all the music you could buy was at the record store downtown then it would be fine to focus on music from your area. Even today, local music reviewers are pretty darn valuable. And if NME wants to be the rock music reviewers that's fine. But to say these are the greatest albums is being intellectually dishonest. I would also say it's doing a disservice to its readers by continuing this perpetual white male UK/America bias that music critics have about what's the best ever.

So if a hip-hop magazine put out the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" and they were all hip-hop I'd roll my eyes too. But they don't really do that... it's the white rocker people who are so darn sure their music is the only thing that has hit the masterpiece status... and *maybe* Kind of Blue.

But who gives a crap about any of these lists. As someone who doesn't want to be confined to one genre, one nation, one set of ideals, I'd love to have an actual place that does reviews of stuff from around the world and can gather them together in a more reasonable context. I want to hear the greatest albums and not just the rock albums. It's the cornerstone philosophy of how I view listening to music in today's Internet age, and I feel like critics and critical sites ignore this argument. In doing so they lose credibility."
68043,best science fiction novel,"I'm looking for a copy of Dune with [this cover](http://hodderscape.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dune-cover.jpg) but can't find it for sale anywhere. It apparently released on the 16th July, so I expected it to be the easiest to find. Anyone know where I can buy a copy in the UK? Thanks."
