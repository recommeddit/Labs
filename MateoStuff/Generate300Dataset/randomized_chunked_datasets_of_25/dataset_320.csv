The issue I have with gvim/Vista isn't, I don't think, Vista itself -- it's the particular install on which I don't have admin access or persistent changes (literally I have to install some things every. time. I use them. It's fun!)",best text editor

58772,"Nice post that I agree with. My first real cologne that I picked and accepted as my scent was Rochas Man. I still use it after 4 years. Considering im 20 its a long time. 

Now funny story about a perfume being associated with your name... My close friends know how I smell however whenever they ask me what I use, I say its a secret. Kinda teasing them. A year ago a close girlfriend of mine started dating a guy, which coincidentally used Rochas. She made him change his perfume because he smelled like me and she felt uncomfortable about it.

She loves the scent on me, complimented to me about it many times before they got togather.",best cologne

I obviously haven't read anything else by him, so they could all be much better, but between how good Seveneves was, and the fact Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Neuromancer are both already on the list, it seems fair to include a hard Sci-Fi end/ rebuilding of the world book on here instead of another cyberpunk touchstone.",best science fiction novel

51138,"I feel that it's a kind of limited viewpoint in today's age of the Internet. Maybe like twenty years ago when all the music you could buy was at the record store downtown then it would be fine to focus on music from your area. Even today, local music reviewers are pretty darn valuable. And if NME wants to be the rock music reviewers that's fine. But to say these are the greatest albums is being intellectually dishonest. I would also say it's doing a disservice to its readers by continuing this perpetual white male UK/America bias that music critics have about what's the best ever.

So if a hip-hop magazine put out the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"" and they were all hip-hop I'd roll my eyes too. But they don't really do that... it's the white rocker people who are so darn sure their music is the only thing that has hit the masterpiece status... and *maybe* Kind of Blue.

But who gives a crap about any of these lists. As someone who doesn't want to be confined to one genre, one nation, one set of ideals, I'd love to have an actual place that does reviews of stuff from around the world and can gather them together in a more reasonable context. I want to hear the greatest albums and not just the rock albums. It's the cornerstone philosophy of how I view listening to music in today's Internet age, and I feel like critics and critical sites ignore this argument. In doing so they lose credibility.",best rap album
