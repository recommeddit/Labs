4039,best online college,"Excellent advise. Thank you.

>It sounds like your career is setup well, but most IT programs have classes based on certifications. I would recommend taking the cert after the class. For example a typical ""network security"" class will link directly to Security+ cert.

Very well. Funny, I have Sec+, Net+, MCSA and CISSP already :)"

60936,Best comedy show on Netflix,1-4 in my opinion. 4 is pushing it though...
54949,best water filter,"Yes, in fishkeeping, charcoal filters can serve as substrate for Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter."
9772,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I would recommend staying in the Chi5 over FT.  It is off campus, so if you have an hour between classes, you have to find somewhere to hang out, while if you lived on campus, you could go take a nap or something  and not have to plan to spend your entire day on campus. There is only one dining hall for FT, while for CHI-5 there are two close by and also Carrillo which is a bike ride away. FT might look like a hotel high rise since they have pool etc, but CHI-5 is like a resort. It's just more livable. It's next to the beach or lagoon, people sit out on the grass, it's serene. FT is on a busy street with people constantly yelling ""fuck FT"" from their cars at you. The CHI-5 dorms are tamer than FT, but it doesn't really matter if you are in a party dorm because you just go out to IV to party anyways. 
Out of the CHI-5 I would say Anacapa, Santa Cruz and Rosa over San Nic and Mig because there are a lot of stairs and their rooms are pretty small, even if they are doubles. I'd say Santa Cruz > Anacapa>Santa Rosa. Santa Cruz is the closest to the beach and the most newly renovated. Anacapa is just as nice, it's just slightly farther away from everything. (These distances are pretty negligible but if you want to get picky). Santa Rosa is more in the center of things, right next to two of the dining halls but it looks like it is stuck in the 70s and it's not looking over the beach at all."

1813,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Revolver Pizza on San Andreas is a new place. Heard nothing but good reviews. And the place that it used to be Paesano’s was my favorite in town. So if there is any remnant of Paesano’s there it’s gotta be good.
36999,best roller coaster at six flags,"Yeah, my feet are really prone to getting sore anyways, so having any form of G's in a stand-up is just hell for me.
As for TC, can we all just agree that it's insane?"
45949,best trick or treating candy,"When I was little, a neighbor used to give out freshly made cotton candy. It was effing awesome."
15007,best romantic novel,"Nobody mentioned it, so I'll say The Hating Game by Sally Thorne. Up until today, it's one of the best romance novels I've read, and I've read plenty."
146,best terminal file manager reddit,LF
73527,best battery bank,I second Anker. Top notch products. I've owned probably 20 different Anker products and none have really ever failed me. Their powercore line of powerbanks are the highest quality powerbanks available.
38617,best newspapers to read,"Totally agree.  People who read just one paper that agrees with their point of view are just adding to their own confirmation bias. It can end up being a bit of an intellectual dead end. I prefer to read articles from various sources, both UK and overseas (if an international story).    Do think physical newspapers are a bit old fashioned.  Haven't bought one regularly in years and tend to use online versions."

66082,best college in california,There is also [California Community Colleges](/r/calcommunitycolleges).
40004,best Chrome extensions,"Many of these are cross-browser, but beware, some of them like Grammarly require a paid subscription to work."
38646,best newspapers to read,"True. That's why I believe immigrants are modern day saints that are hellbent on destroying the country, especially the muslim ones who each bring with them love, diversity, and suicide vests.

Combining two biased opposing views has brought me close to the truth."
62497,Best RPG game on PS4,"That's a bit tough. DS 2 gets a bad rap by hardcore fans, but it's still a worthy entry if you fall in love with the other two. DS3 is really great, and the most polished. DS1 is a masterpiece in it's own right with plenty of brilliant ambition, but you can tell it's a bit older and made by a team still figuring some things out a bit. I go back and forth between recommending 3 first and recommending 1 first. If you enjoy it, Bloodborne is also fantastic (some say the single greatest PS4 game in existence), and there's a whole subgenre that's grown out of Dark souls (the souls-like genre) that also would include nioh and a few other titles. I liked the surge, lords of the fallen is a total souls clone, but somehow fails completely. Surge 2 is coming out in september along with code vein, which is also souls-like. I personally consider sekiro to be souls-like, although it's definitely a brand new path for From Software as well."
