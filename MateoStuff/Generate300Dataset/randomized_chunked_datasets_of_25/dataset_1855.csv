68763,"I read a great many of those books in my youth. I still don't see Ender's game rising to the level of several of those other books. Ender's game builds up to one big twist plot-wise. The characters are relatively underdeveloped. 

I think several other books give broader visions of the future or humanity or the mind. Many of them are stunning especially if you consider them in their time of publication. 

I loved Enders Game but it just didn't take me where Heinlen, Asimov, Pournelle, and several other did. Or Simmons, Vinge, Banks, or Scalzi did afterwards.",best science fiction novel

25633,"Thanks :). It can be extended to individual players, but it does get more computationally intensive because there are many more players than teams. 

The data I collected dates to the early 1990s and it takes data for about 6 years to compute the ranking. So the earliest rank I have is from 1996 or so and indeed the highest ranked ODI team is Cronje's team around '96-99. On the other hand Australia has been ranked first in ODIs for a longer period than all the other teams combined in the period shown.",best cricket teams of all time
