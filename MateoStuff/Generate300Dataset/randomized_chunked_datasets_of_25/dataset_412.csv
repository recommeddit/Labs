67169,axios alternatives reddit,Same. Using the same interface as the frontend means you can write utilities that work regardless of where you're importing them
60991,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I love all the other suggestions! Haven't seen Frankie and Grace listed, though. Don't write it off just because it's got a cast of senior citizens as the main characters- it's hilarious and heartfelt. I'm 25 and I lose my shit when watching it."
12028,best gifts for dad,"my coworker was gifted (during Christmas) a usb iPhone cord that was Christmas lights (green cord with acorn shaped colorful lights, looked like someone chopped it off their annoying neighbors decorative collection)

24652,best anime,"I suggest creating a anime list; so that way you can add stuff you want to see, remember stuff that you've seen as you watch more stuff, et cetra. (You can create one at myanimelist.net or anilist.co; both are free).

I also highly suggest keeping an open mind to a variety of different genres; just because you never know if you'll like it or not, if you don't try it.

As for recommendations:

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood

Hunter x Hunter 2011

My Hero Academia

Assassination Classroom

Steins; Gate (some people don't like the anime until episode 10 or 11 and think it gets better then, but I liked the whole thing).

Re Zero: Starting Life in Another World

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (Don't judge just watch, at least 
watch until episode 3 before judging).

Made in Abyss (Don't judge just watch)

Erased (I didn't like the ending but I liked the journey getting 
there).

Psycho-Pass (I personally didn't like the second season as much, but liked the first season)

Cowboy Bebop

One Punch Man

Konosuba 

Death Note (I didn't like the second half of the anime as much, but enjoyed the first half).

Akatsuki no Yona (Warning anime has cliffhanger ending, but I 
personally really enjoyed it).

Death Parade

Toradora (Make sure to watch the end credit of the finale, some 
people miss it)

Your Lie in April

Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun

Kokoro Connect

Tasogare Otome x Amnesia

Usagi Drop (Don't read the manga)

A Silent Voice (Movie)

Wolf Children (Movie)

Your Name (Movie)"
32118,best hotel to live in,CitizenM hotel in Amsterdam (though they have them in a bunch of other cities). The hotel is designed to be super functionally minimalistic in that they get rid of everything guests probably won’t use/need and make everything they would use/need exponentially better & cooler.
31994,best hotel to live in,I have low standards for hotels. So my definition is basically the more expensive out of the 3 star variety

64537,Best Nike running shoes,"Thanks for the info. Yeah I meant Nike's most popular marathon shoe, I think you are right that the Boost was the actual most popular overall. Same as you, I'm racing in LT3's right now, I like them, but from what I read and hear the Streaks might be more up my alley with just a little more support and durability. I just did some Googlnig and the Streak 6's were supposed to be launched June 1? Can't find them at all on the Nike site."
18210,best YouTube video,"Good because a former decorated member of the United States marine corps needs your help. 

AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!!!"
30449,best Mexican war to study,"I'm fascinated by the short transition period RIGHT after WW2 in Berlin.  Russians got there, US got there, the soldiers partied together cuz the defeater Hitler, then they had the awkward ""wait, you're a communist/capitalist"" conversation then the Cold War began."

19772,best YouTube video,"Here are some of my personal faves, I can't pick just one of these. If you find the selection a bit random, it's because i watch a mishmash of pretty much everything. Anyways:

 

**POLYBIUS - The Video Game That Doesn't Exist** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_7X6Yeydgyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7X6Yeydgyg)

One hour documentary about the urban legend of Polybius, the quality is stunning and the all of the videos on this channel are really good and I highly recomend them.

**TempleOS | Down the Rabbit Hole** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCgoxQCf5Jg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCgoxQCf5Jg)

A video about the story of Temple OS and it's schizophrenic creator Terry A. Davis. The rest of Frederik Knudsen's videos are pretty good too, mostly talking about strange things, events and such; the Time Cube, the Collyer Brothers, Chris-chan, etc. are some of the stuff he's covered.

**The Unknowns: Mystifying UFO Cases** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7T1v\_VHpE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb7T1v_VHpE)

The video delves into the expansive and complicated history of American UFO research. More precisely, the government sanctioned undertaking known as Project Blue Book, exploring a few of these unknowns in order to understand what makes them so mystifying. I'm repeating myself, but guess what: the rest of Lemmino's videos are great too.

**history of the entire world, i guess** \- [https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs](https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs) 

The even better sequel to the instant classic ""history of japan"".

**The Youtube Geographic series** \- [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjXwcOEO8rkR0XeFTCoeaMk74V-49PyAt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjXwcOEO8rkR0XeFTCoeaMk74V-49PyAt)

Yeah, yeah, i know it's not one video, but all of them are very good videos. They are about certain events in Youtube's history, told in a entertaining way.

**Athletic Theme (PAL Version) - Super Mario World** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEcOzjg7vBU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEcOzjg7vBU)

Don't be fooled by the name. It's not actually real, but a pretty epic remix. I warn you, it's impossible to unhear. It's been 2 years and i'm still always disappointed when i hear the original because i expect this tbh :/

**The Penguins of Madagascar Obtain the N Word Pass** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjt-xRkjFaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjt-xRkjFaY)

Very HQ meme.

**MINE DIAMONDS | miNECRAFT PARODY OF TAKE ON ME** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgha9S39Y6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgha9S39Y6M)

I will never forget this video.

**YouTube Rewind 2018 but it's actually good** \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By\_Cn5ixYLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By_Cn5ixYLg)

Exactly what the title says.
