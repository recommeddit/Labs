We got it as a mystery hotel for 200/night all inclusive for 2,best vacation resort

I realised on reading further and thinking rationally that this is pretty much the standard shower head on a hose that we get in the UK.

71118,"Yep I think that's why the ending still lands despite almost everyone having seen the iconic beach image. It's not just a ""gotcha!"" ending, it comes after the reveal of why ""The Forbidden Zone"" is restricted, Dr Zaius's cover up, and the implication of what mankind had done. So bleak.",best movies with a cool twist

The food was amazing (please send Peach cobbler) and for a US city, there's a lot of history to discover as well. Many people rip on it, but I loved it, even the coke museum.

32315,"DUDE.

I was at a hawaiian hotel luau where they served rolls with those butter balls. I'm first in line looking at the food labels first, then the food. Then I see some puffed up name for rolls like ""Hawaiian Super Rolls"" or something. Next to the label were the little butter balls. I'm thinking ""OH SWEET! Some sorta tiny, fancy, shiny rolls. All about it."" And I grab like 10.

Then one of the hosts sees and exclaims, ""Ohhh, BUTTER MAN!!"" and then I look up and see some basic rolls in a basket just next to me. Fuck. I'm already 10 butters in and only want 1 real roll. I can't put them back, I can't let him know I'm am idiot. Gotta let him believe I'm eating just as much butter as bread my whole life.",best hotel to live in

67371,"If you have to rely on a 3rd party library to make requests I'm sorry but you need to learn how to use `fetch`.  Way too many enterprise companies write wrappers around `fetch` to adapt it to their needs and if you don't know how to use `fetch`, you won't know how to use their wrapper effectively.In reality even if you do prefer a 3rd party solution, I'd like to remind you that understanding where an abstraction comes from only helps you better understand the abstraction.

`fetch` is native, learn how to use.",axios alternatives reddit
