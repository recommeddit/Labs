892,best desk lamp,"Actually, they're really cheap.  The ones I saw on ebay were actual brass (well, at least the ""vintage"" ones definitely were, brass was cheaper than plastic in those days anyways).  It's pretty easy to tell fake brass from real brass, even in a photo.  [Here's one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/BRASS-BANKERS-LAMP-WITH-ADJUSTABLE-HEAD-LIGHT-BULB-/221105876705/) that looks pretty BIFL.  [This one](www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-BRASS-BANKERS-DESK-LAMP-w-CLEAR-RIBBED-GLASS-SHADE-/190713964259) and [this one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-MID-CENTURY-Green-Shade-Desk-Bankers-LAMP-Brass-/330778671484) are pretty cheap and look like real brass and glass to me.  If you can't tell from the photo whether it's real brass, check how much they're asking for shipping.  Brass and glass are pretty heavy, so it'll be around $15 or $20 (plastic would probably be closer to $10)."

23909,best anime,Apart from being in the same universe Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes have very little in common. But I like both Anime and Steins;Gate is very close to making the list.
21564,best winnie the pooh comic,"They seem genuine in that they would be humorous and benign through the lens of Winnie The Pooh, but taken out of context and in the cynical humor of the internet he sounds like a real fucker."
68368,best science fiction novel,"I have a shelf full of Niven, and the guy has always wrapped amazing sci-fi ideas around the crummiest pulp characters."
71537,best movies with a cool twist,"I love Snape as a character, but I agree with you that I don't find him admirable. 

As for Sirius I'd argue the way he treated Kreacher had less to do with Sirius thinking of him as an ""inferior"" and more to do with the fact that Kreacher was a strong reminder of a very bad part of his past. Also having a shitty childhood and 12 years in wizard joy-sucking prison probably leaves you with some difficult anger issues. Not saying Sirius is flawless, obviously, I just don't see him as hypocritical. He never looked down on Lupin for being a werewolf or Lilly for being muggle-born, for example."
43786,best items under $100,That's a pretty cool thing to buy when you're bored tbh

34946,best NFL player,"Loving the clips in these writeups.

In the Dalvin Cook blurb, there's a play against the Titans (the hyperlink says ""massive plays"") where Malcolm Butler goes out of bounds and then comes back in to swipe at the ball - is that legal? It feels like it shouldn't be."
38149,best Marvel movie,"That is a really good story. Also crazy that you were there for that... Because I remember when Iron Man came out. It was the summer in between my junior and senior year of high school. All of my friends and I stayed after the credits for the cut scene with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and then we talked about how one of us had read in a magazine (those were in '08) how there was going to be a film or two every summer until they all converged in like 2012 or 2013... Back then, it was unheard of. And the fact that you were at Hall H is pretty wild. 

Also, I worked in the film industry for a couple of years and met a lot of people. Never met Norton, but know many friends that have. He's apparently a huge dick. He and Cumberbatch (who I have met) are notoriously the worst to work for/with. Apparently Norton was never happy with the studio or the script. He rewrote the whole thing which is just bizarre because he's not a good writer."
