"Sandals Ochos Rios in Jamaica. It's the only all-inclusive I've ever been to, so I'm bias. We went there for our honeymoon, it was amazing. Weather was beautiful, food and drinks were great. The room was great. several day activities included, or you could go off the resort for a few excursions. Best massage I've ever had in my life, we talk about Jamaica at least once a month and it's been over a year now. Plus from our house the flight was super short.

Edit: It was the perfect spot for lounging in a pool drinking and eating, and activities if you choose. The resort always had evening things going on, but there was no pressure to go to them. It was also very private too. Almost every night we'd go swimming in hot tubing and there was no one else around. Also all sandals resorts are kid-free, so you don't have to worry about that either."

I'm a big fan of Versace Eau Fraiche. definitely a strong fresh smell.
Kyle Mooney is so great.  I was so happy to see him land a gig on SNL and still be able to do this kind of comedy.
"Strong ginger beer and dark rum. Simple, accessible, tasty. Throw a bit of lime in there too if you have it."
I could tell from your username you're an avid reader and possibly even dabbled in writing.
"Indian pressure cookers are very uncomplicated though. Which is what i like.

No fancy manometers, no timers, just basic weights for pressure release and stove top use.

I love them"
I suppose it is down to individual taste.
Only thing steering me away from some Top Designs models and other small companies is roll tops.
Brave is good.

"> I use a dummy battery in the DSLR for the constant power. It's not a turn off problem, it's seems to be the mirror flipping closed or something like that.

That seems really weird, which DSLR camera is that one? Or maybe either the dummy battery is not working correctly or a wrong setting in the camera. Although its not gonna really matter since for your usage it does seem annoying if you kept using the DLSR setup because you have to move around(location buildings) a lot plus the extra setup + space requirements yeah not worth the hassle - this is more of a always left forever there untouched streaming setup :P"
"Yes! It used the screen-based as essential to its storytelling, not just a newfangled gimmick. I had fun speculating what the ending was gonna be and it was such a wild thrill ride that especially escalated after the dad throws that one movie in the trash. Heavy emotional note."
"My disappointment is unmeasurable and my day is ruined.

But on a serious note ucsc is really at crossroads and needs to address some systemic issues at the University. Bad administration of the universities funds and goals along with issues within the town to Santa Cruz are a real threat to the school losing its identity and roots. It's really sad the school provides such an interesting counter to UCAL, Berkeley and Santa Barbara the UC system will be worse off if it's strange little outcast smoking weed in the redwoods loses its identity."
"Aussie, I'd much rather live in Norway. Aussie women are no match for Norwegians, I'd make less, by the stats I'd be happier. Did I mention Norwegian women?"

"i think magister meant that a calorie spike the day before a workout doesn't destroy workouts (in fact, broadly speaking, it helps--replenishing glycogen, etc).  if op doesnt want to work out hard the day after beer-drinking, the obvious reason is that op is hungover.  to suggest its the carbs or the calories is kinda like eating a meth-filled apple right before your best workout ever, then suggesting that the key to good workouts is apples.  it's possible that it was the little sugar spike that gave you that great surge of energy, but magister would suggest it may be the meth"
"No, most people are actually interested in finding solutions or agree on the ends and not the means. It's just that vocal 10% that won't shut up or hear anyone else out."
