ðŸ˜‚ oh man. Sorry!
I stand corrected... I will be discussing this with my colleagues this evening. Thanks.
"Nice! As Iâ€™ve gone for Sierra Blue Iâ€™m quite limited in options unless they end up doing a colour matched version. My case arrived today, now to play the waiting game!"
"I see. Although it only has a 256 GB SSD (there is an open M.2 slot), I'd go with this sale on the [**Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14""**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/164805306665?mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5338636961&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1). Ryzen 5 4500U, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, 1080p 14"" IPS 300 nit display. It should be great for general use, plus the build quality is solid."
"OP likely, since that's what they asked for."

"I just wish there was one that stayed cool all night, I sleep hotter than the fucking sun and can barely tolerate a throw blanket."
"Hazel.

They grow 12m max, and you get catkins which look nice and Dormice love them.

You could plant a Cherry tree on the other side if you want the two to be different. Also a tree that has a nice blossom, and they don't grow massive.

Field Maple is a good hardy hedgerow tree, but grows fairly large eventually. Pretty colouring in autumn though.

Kind of wish you hadn't gone with laurel, tbh. It's hardy but it grows damn big if you let it and it seems to be a primary spot for wasp nests in my experience! I would've favoured some traditional British bushes/shrubs like blackthorn, hawthorn etc all mixed up so you get some berries on them for wildlife. You could still do that if you don't mind mixing them and taking out a few chunks of laurel. If you got a good amount of blackthorn you can make sloe gin!"
"Not exactly what you were asking, but if you are just looking for sashimi check out Kanaloa Seafood. Hell check it out even if you aren't. Really good seafood market, probably best in the area. Really high quality."

"Ginger? According to my German grandfather, you're supposed to drink a lot of booze. If that doesn't work, drink more booze."
"Did you read the article? Several of those use cases I covered.

&#x200B;

Let me know specifics & I'm happy to address or add them. They still might not be 'pretty' - so you may still want axios, but I want to at least demonstrate a functioning pattern for each case.

Some of the things like default cookie handling is silly but security related. Cookies are easily added with the opt-in \`{credentials}\` param (granted it's the worst name for cookie stuff)  but it works."
"Clean the house / other home stuff.  It's usually touted as a mom gift, but it works for Dads too.  Moreso if you focus on the things that tend to be Dad's domain, like mowing the lawn."
"There is no best browser.

I can say however that Chrome that used to be the best, is no longer. 

For my personal use, Firefox \-\> Edge \-\> Vivaldi, most of the time i use Edge because it's faster to respond, it does lack for some compatibility because it's new, in those cases Firefox. Vivaldi is also nice."
Quite welcome.

"Is it the directors cut? The normal version has a massive spoiler at the start if not, gives the film away."

"A new hobby. Most have super low barriers to entry. I started playing music, my ukelele and kalimba cost me $60 total. I also started making miniatures for d&d, the foam core, paints, amd other bits cost me $20. Find something cool that you've always wanted to try and do it!"
