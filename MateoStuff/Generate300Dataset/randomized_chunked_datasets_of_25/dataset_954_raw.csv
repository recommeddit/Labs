Oh I was referring to the currency. I was obviously just kidding.

"I want to see more range-extender options.  Commute-range battery + range extender for road trips.  Something like GM's Voltec is ideal.

I could charge at work and at various public charging stations but cannot charge at home, and I take too many long trips to deal with charging on the road, so BEVs are a non-starter for me."
"I used to work for Lowe’s for 10 years till this past January as a millwork specialist. Lowe’s does not care who they hire. I can swear to you the only hire people to fill in for coverage. You might have a few good full timers but half the departments will be empty staffed or being covered by a kid who’s in lumber and also covering millwork and hardware at the same time, who’s being payed probably 12-13$ a hour."
This is the third time I've seen that in this thread.  I need to pay more attention.
I have a 64 GB USB C memory stick that I use for transferring of photos. I can't plug that in to my phone
"I would recommend picking something you can play by yourself.  Bass and drums are cool, but can get a little boring without people to play with.  Piano and guitar are great solo instruments and you can play them for hours at a time.

Also, think about which instrument are you drawn to the most?  If you can't decide, then think about what music or songs you want to play.  Then ask which instrument will best play."

Thanks for the recommendation and I am glad the updates are that simple.
Then who the fuck is voting for no toothpaste!
Tied between Beamspring and capacitive buckling springs.
I would have to add The Fountain. Trippy
"Depends on your location, outside 110V countries L1 is a regular outlet and L2 are 'normal' chargers between 3-22kW."
Yeah that new pooh shiesty dude not bad
Jagged rectangle.
"I ruin sunglasses very quickly (I stuff them in my purse and they always get scratched), so I usually buy several at a time for less than $10 a pair. I'm really in love with a pair of yellow heart-shaped frames I got for like $6."
It will cost about $40-60 a year to operate depending on your electric rate.
The UK and Europe.  I’ll swap you the full sugar version any day.
How Euro-y does Brass feel to play? I'm crazy interested in this game but my group tends to get bored with games if there's not enough excitement going on.
"Came here to say this, very happy someone beat me to it. 

Also, Killer Mikes album RAP Music is an excellent pre-RTJ soundtrack, and is produced by El-P so it has a sort of proto-RTJ feel. Absolutely worth checking out."

"Yep, was scrolling to see if anyone pointed that out. I have to take antihistamines every morning (yay for allergies and mysterious autoimmune nonsense), usually Claritin or Zyrtec, and they don't make me drowsy at all. Something like Benadryl will definitely make most people pretty sleepy, but that's not a feature of all antihistamines."
I used to love her back in the day but she’s changed so much :(
I was born in the 80's and I agree with this sentiment as well.
Nike Infinity Reacts are awesome!
