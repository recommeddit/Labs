73265,best Linux distro,"I’m curious, and I don’t think anyone else has asked yet, but why not consider a rolling release distro?

Edit:

If you just really dislike rolling releases, I would say Kubuntu (KDE Ubuntu) is an option I daily drove for a long time. There’s also other Ubuntu derivatives (Elementary, Kylin, Deepin, KDE Neon, etc). 

What it’s really coming down to then is your UI / UX, and I think KDE is just a solid bet, in my opinion.

I basically cloned the MacOS UI/UX (as much as I reasonably could) in KDE (https://github.com/CSAndrew/MacOSM), but it’s just as easy to bring over the W11 UI/UX (if you prefer that). 

You could also just use a WM instead of a DE and go with something like TheGloriousDotfiles, but you’re really going to want a Desktop Environment on your first Linux run.

590,best vpn for torrenting reddit,It is a little different for each Torrent client.  Just google your client name along with IP bind.  You should get lots of links to choose from.

36118,best alcoholic drink,"Reeds spicy ginger beer is great with this. The one with the red cap, does anyone actually drink the green cap one?"

68704,best science fiction novel,"Personally I think Peter F Hamilton's books are really up there, more on the Dune side of things than the PKD side of things though. The Void trilogy and The Night's Dawn Trilogy are excellent (though I think the latter may have bridged the 20th and 21st centuries)."
50515,best rap album,LEMONADE WAS A POPULAR DRINK AND IT STILL IS
43881,best items under $100,That's great! Thank you!
68011,best science fiction novel,"Tunnel in the Sky, i couldnt put this down as an adolescent and still often think of it today. Farnhams Freehold is also a good read, it was written during the height of the Civil rights movement and you can feel that in its content and subject matter. Although to me Starship Troopers is amazing. Heinlein's military background really put a unique perspective on Troopers that i had never read before that point."

26627,best board games,"Why CoB the card game and not regular CoB? I have both and prefer regular CoB over card version, hence the question."
14396,best romantic novel,😬 apparently I’m terrible at the favorite books game ☺️
39022,best web browser,"Firefox on the desktop, I don't trust google at all and webkit/blink has too much market share. Firefox is the only remaining competing rendering engine and needs the support, besides it is great to use and I prefer the interface. I use vivaldi occasionally as a backup.

On mobile I prefer the interface of chrome, firefox mobile is horrible to use and I dont care about sync at all. However chrome has no ad blocking so that is ruled straight out, Ive been using kiwibrowser, basically a chromium fork with ad blocking built in."
6025,best programming language for web development,"First of all, very cool to see someone so young and so motivated!

As far as languages, for web dev, HTML/CSS and JS are musts. Python is cool, but focus on those.

58897,best perfume,"I'm not good at describing all the notes, but it's a sophisticated scent that is just wonderful.  And lasts!  Started wearing it in the very early 80s.  It's the original Halston (I think there have been some later Halston scents that aren't the same).  The bottle is sort of shaped like the Jadore bottle and the fragrance itself is kind of an amber color.  You can buy it on Fragrance net.com"

64857,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"> Deja Vu out in IV.

Ah, memories of cheese fries after a night of having a beer or two during college. They even delivered. It was utterly disgusting then and I can't imagine it has changed that much, but I thoroughly enjoyed that greasy mess at the time."

53314,best usb c charging cable,"Those Anker Powerline + are the best cables. They also make a C to C if you are going to use the Google charging brick.

Hit up your local Target also and check the clearance section in electronics. I have gotten a bunch of Native union cables for like $8-10 lately.  And they are great.
