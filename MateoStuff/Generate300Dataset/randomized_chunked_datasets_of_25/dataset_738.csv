47419,"I can only speak from experience so I would recommend visiting Mount Rainier in Washington. It has a lot of hiking (from beginner to experienced) and some of the most beautiful landscapes! The wildflowers are a personal favorite of mine. If you enjoy lakes check out Lake Chelan (also in Washington). It is glacier-fed, super deep, and has crystal clear water. On one end of the lake is a lodge called Stehekin, and the only way to get there is by plane or boat. 

If you enjoy fishing, I'd say go to Alaska. I've personally only fished in Sitka, but it was the easiest and most rewarding fishing experience I've ever had. Plus it's beautiful up there!

47866,"The reason why I'm asking is because in high school, I took calculus AB and BC which made me use the calculator for tons of things. Like I had word problems that required the use of the calculator to do an integral or derivative that would be impossible/way too tedious to do by hand.

So I wont be having those types of problems in multivariable calculus?",best graphing calculator for vector calculus
52337,"I love hip hop, but I guess I can only classify really as the radio listening type. But in my opinion I think in order for an album to  be the greatest of all time, they must have somewhat gained a bit of recognition in the mainstream.  Having said that, I find the lack of Eminem a little disappointing. I know a lot of hip hop heads discredit the dude for one reason or the other, but damn that album made headlines. And also risking contradicting myself,
 I find including kanye a bit disappointing. I always found kanye to have made gteat music, but not greatest of all time. I find the character kanye is much more interesting than his music, and sometimes I think when so many people tells me he is supposed to be some kind of genius musician, I just don't hear it. But yeah , I agree, Kendrick is one of a kind.",best hiphop album

26242,"The great 19th century Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell, perhaps the most competent proponent of Irish Home Rule. Parnell held the balance of power between the Liberals and the Conservatives and pushed through his vision of Irish independence.

Gladstone described him as: ""I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was an intellectual phenomenon."" Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A.J.P. Taylor says, ""More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation.""",best politician
