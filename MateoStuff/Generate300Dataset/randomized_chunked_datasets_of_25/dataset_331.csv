And i'm not even talking about Inter vs Juve, i confronted us with Arsenal, and you think they are a better european club than us or Ajax?

Nobody, and i mean nobody, would suggest that Juve is a better european club than Milan, but that table suggests exactly that.",best soccer team in the world

It’s subtly shaped like a ship’s sail out in the water [(photo)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Al_Arab#/media/File%3ABurj_Al_Arab%2C_Dubai%2C_by_Joi_Ito_Dec2007.jpg)  and is said to be the only 7-star hotel in the world.
