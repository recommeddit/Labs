13888,"My favorite is a short article from Nature in 1985 by Harold Kroto that more or less won a Nobel Prize for him, and pissed off a slew of Exxon researchers who realized that they had observed these ""C60"" structures but just didn't know what they had a year before the article was published.... Gene Dresselhous has a great video about it. This was the first mention of the now ubiquitous Buckyball.

11143,"Oh, don't get me wrong, sleeves and bags for laptops are good, but op asked about backpacks. I have a Crumpler sleeve (Which is great) and some other brand laptop bag (Which I found to be way to heavy). Anyway, I actually prefer backpacks. You see, I work night shifts mostly in area that is pretty much Prague's center of criminality and night life. Now I am a pretty big guy and there are easier targets out there, but I still feel a little more comfortable having a backpack that doesn't scream I have a expensive as fu.. laptop in it. + I usually have to fit either massive amounts of books for college or a lot of other stuff whenever I go anywhere.

That said, sleeves you linked look great. Will look into it when I need one.",best backpack for college
