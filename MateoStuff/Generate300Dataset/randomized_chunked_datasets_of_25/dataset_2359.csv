65396,best phone service company,"I have had multiple different phone plans and for me Verizon blows them out of the park. I live in an area where good WiFi is impossible so it’s always good to have a service provider that provides super fast, unlimited data. Honestly the only downside I have with Verizon is that sometimes the data will randomly stop working for a couple of hours (usually at night) and that Can be very annoying especially if you’re like me and you don’t have very good WiFi at you’re house. It doesnt happen too often but it’s enough to be an issue."

68373,best science fiction novel,"I'll defend Niven on The Mote in God's Eye since I recently re-read it.  

Sally is on the ship because she was touring planets as an anthropologist exploring the more primitive cultures left after humanity's first empire collapsed.  She is shown as extremely capable, is a political figure as a senator's niece and heir to several titles, and is a scientist.  The major setting of the novel is military, so it's something of a given that there will be few women.  This is flipped on its head though for the moties.  Without spoiling the plot of the book, the aliens and their sexual biology play a huge role in their society and it acts as something of a mirror to humanity showing how locked-in gender roles could be if our biology were different.

Far from being a damsel, Sally is critical in both the plot and the ship's mission of investigating the aliens.  And while the culture of the second empire is conservative in regards to women, Sally is very aware of this due to her academic profession and is adamant about not losing her position of power and autonomy by marrying just some noble.  Again, without spoiling the plot of the book, she does marry but voluntarily for love despite other political entanglements.  I wouldn't say the morals of the society aren't questioned so much as they are rationalized by what the society has survived, namely a huge drop in population and near collapse of civilization.


Edit: Forgot to include another point in Sally's favor.  While it is glossed over far too quickly, Sally was on a planet that revolted and was put in a concentration camp before the novel's start.  There she was THE leader of the camp prisoners and did her best to help them survive, often sacrificing her own well being.  So yeah, she's the only woman, but she's a hell of a woman."

^(1) Per [this list](https://github.com/request/request#table-of-contents)

**Odds are you were only using:**

- Streaming
- Promises & Async/Await
- Custom HTTP Headers
- TLS/SSL Protocol

**`fetch` doesn't do^(2):**

- Caching
- Cookies
- Retries on failure
- Progress events
- Custom defaults
- Composable
- Hooks

^(2) Per [this chart](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#comparison)

If those are features that you want, then `fetch` probably wouldn't cut it for you and you would need to look for something more full-featured."

49608,best gaming monitor,"The 144hz is in reference to framerates, which are wholly unrelated to response times.  Response times are rarely an issue at all(even for competitive players) as any quality gaming monitor thesedays sport great response times. 


But 60hz panels are significantly worse, even if you end up gaming at 60fps.  A 144hz monitor will be far smoother even scrolling through websites, but even gaming at 60fps it will enormously minimize tearing.  

And a 144hz monitor is far more future proof.

Buying a 60hz display today is just dumb."
