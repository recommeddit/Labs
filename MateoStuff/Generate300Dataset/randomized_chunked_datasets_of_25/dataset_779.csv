71050,"Half of the recommendations here don't have ""plot twist"". A plot that has twists and turns does not equate to a plot twist imo.

Also just the fact that a movie has a plot twist, is a spoiler in itself.

With that some of my favorite :

Sixth Sense

Unbreakable
 
Split 

Fight Club

Primal Fear 

The Illusionist 

Saw I. All the Saw movies have a plot twist, but they are none are as good as the original. 

The Prestige 

Oldboy 

Upgrate (2018)

The Usual Suspects

Gone Girl",best movies with a cool twist

18031,"Kim: Very hard-working and ambitious. But superficial and cold at times to her own family.

Khloe: I think she is the funniest and kindest. She is also very hardworking. But she's insecure and allows herself to get taken advantage of.

Kendall: She's pretty but she seems the most out of touch with reality.

Kylie: Very entrepreneurial, influential, and has a unique style. However, I think she hides her personality on KUWTK for some reason and comes across very blah.

Kourtney: I'm sure she's an amazing mom. But she's very self-centered, often rude, and she lacks drive and ambition.",best Kardashian
