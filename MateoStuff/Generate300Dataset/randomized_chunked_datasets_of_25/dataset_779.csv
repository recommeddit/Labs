16101,best sunglasses for fashion,"If you read the comments, it seems that what he claims isnt an honest finding. I had mine tested to see if there is any way they could cause damage to my eyes and I was told that these were perfectly fine."
71050,best movies with a cool twist,"Half of the recommendations here don't have ""plot twist"". A plot that has twists and turns does not equate to a plot twist imo.

Also just the fact that a movie has a plot twist, is a spoiler in itself.

With that some of my favorite :

Sixth Sense

Unbreakable
 
Split 

Fight Club

Primal Fear 

The Illusionist 

Saw I. All the Saw movies have a plot twist, but they are none are as good as the original. 

The Prestige 

Oldboy 

Upgrate (2018)

The Usual Suspects

Gone Girl"

47121,best state to visit in the United States,"Austin is incredible. The food, the nightlife, the public festivals, south congress, art galleries, kayaking, the greenbelt, etc... Plus you've got round rock donuts to the north and saltlick BBQ to the south only thirty minutes in either direction. Plus there's the longhorn football team! Definitely come here, I'll even offer my place for you to crash :)"

18031,best Kardashian,"Kim: Very hard-working and ambitious. But superficial and cold at times to her own family.

Khloe: I think she is the funniest and kindest. She is also very hardworking. But she's insecure and allows herself to get taken advantage of.

Kendall: She's pretty but she seems the most out of touch with reality.

Kylie: Very entrepreneurial, influential, and has a unique style. However, I think she hides her personality on KUWTK for some reason and comes across very blah.

Kourtney: I'm sure she's an amazing mom. But she's very self-centered, often rude, and she lacks drive and ambition."

48321,best color to paint with,Benjamin Moore has been the best as far as far as overall quality. The best white is very much depending on an individual opinion and if your decor goes well with warm or cool tones. The best method for choosing your white is to go get some samples of what you think you'd like and find a couple places to paint swatches right on your wall.
