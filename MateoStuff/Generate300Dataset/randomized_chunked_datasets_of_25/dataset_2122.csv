22157,best celebrity,SO JEALOUS! I love them. One of my favorite shows.
46646,best trick or treating candy,"We've kept detailed stats on which candy is preferred by trick-or-treaters over the past 4 years / 3 houses, and the burn curves are clear. When given a choice of a variety of name-brand full-size candy bars, kids prefer plain Hershey bars. These always go first, no matter where we're living or what other candy options are available."
3242,best webcamera,Refurbished cannons are decent if you want to get into filming and pictures. Cannon often has sells and you can get a m50 for only 350$Which usually that stuff runs to about 600 :)
4682,best home improvement store,Watch out for the gas dryers haha!
60096,best perfume,I thought that was an expensive one
45281,best gaming system,I mean technically. The 360 is leagues better than the One
73225,best Linux distro,"If you want to learn then go semi hardcore using Debian net-iso and go from there.  I think people get too used to the bells and whistles with a complete distro where they actually never learn anything because it's already there for you.  Start at the ground then learn how to install i3, XCFE or something else and start modding your setup.  It's more fun that way too like building a PC from scratch with LEDs and stuff."
73088,best Linux distro,I agree with you on Steam. Lutris also worked much better for me than on my previous Linux Mint 20 installation.
24178,best anime,"My Must Watch animes will be:

[HunterxHunter](http://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter): Not only this thing is fun but thrilling and EXTREMELY entertaining. You really get hooked up even though it's freaking long. You should watch both of them but I think the 2011 remake is better.

[Great Teacher Onizuka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-7TQXvdll0): Long story short, just the worst person in the world becoming a high school teacher. 

[Detroit Metal City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYIhZLEDSgw): You will not find anything funnier than this guys, TRUST ME. I've seen Gintama, Toriko, and I laughed my heart out with GTO but this... THIS IS A GEM. I can assure you this will always cheer you up if you're having a bad day.

[Log Horizon](http://www.crunchyroll.com/log-horizon): If you want to actually understand a little bit about your world, this might be really helpful. Take .hack//Sign and mash it up with SAO and you'll have this. It's a really really good ""I'm stucked in a VMMORPG for life"".

[Fate/Stay Night](http://www.crunchyroll.com/fatestay-night): Has a huge saga over and behind it and I can say it's a pretty well developed fantasy series. It has magic, blood, sexy girls, and a huge background (somehow pagan) which made it into a huge very successful saga. I has 2 prequels, 2 spinoffs and a lot of videogames.

[Sakamichi no Apollon](http://www.crunchyroll.com/kids-on-the-slope): One of the most amazing music based anime series I have ever seen. With music composed and rearranged by Yoko Kano (best known for her work on the Cowboy Bebop's and Wolf's Rain's OST) it will give you some of the most amazing jazz standards played beautifully. Also, the animation is really pretty and fluid and the story behind the characters and their development makes this one of the Seinen series I recommend to every single person I meet. 

Hope you like them :)"

72064,best movies with a cool twist,Something I started to hate with the series was that they made a lot of the games simply unwinnable (I know some of them were purposely unwinnable but a lot of the legit traps were unwinnable).  A lot of people HAD to die like the one with the shotgun carousel.
31894,best hotel to live in,"I did it for a month, gets boring and small, started to feel like a prisoner in a VIP cell. Breakfast also sucked after the 1st week, always the same, meh...meh...meh. 



I went in to the lobby, asked for someone from Sales and negotiated a monthly rate, was expensive, but much cheaper than their daily rate. Cost around $900/month (I think) for the Doubletree Hilton in Yerevan, Armenia. Which is expensive for the city, I rented a small house with garden for $400ish/month in one the best neighborhoods there (near the head honcho's palace).



Would not recommend, unless there's a compelling reason, or its a posh hotel, and you get a nice deal, but don't expect much of a discount when the crowds are in."
20732,best workout music,"Haha same here.

Also Ghost"
1444,best ice cream flavor,"Ben and Jerry's used to do a flavour called ""Chubby Hubby"" if memory serves me correctly it was a malt ice cream with peanut butter filled chocolate covered salted pretzels.
It was the bomb, sadly gone to the graveyard of flavours now...."
45742,best trick or treating candy,The 80-year-old grandma in me loves caramels. I'll trade my Tootsie Rolls for caramels any time.
46306,best trick or treating candy,Walking to the door naked usually says you're not participating. But the key word here is USUALLY.
38544,best newspapers to read,"I read """"Le monde diplomatique"" (once a month newspaper)
and ""die Zeit"", german weekly newspaper

I would read a daily newspaper if i had more money."
64550,Best Nike running shoes,"Yea I had something similar.

Don't buy Nike you normie"
14544,best romantic novel,"Not a book, but an author. Iâ€™m pretty sure I recommend Talia Hibbert way too often. Sheâ€™s just really, really good."
60226,best freezer brand,">What is your stock recipe?

Nothing too out of the ordinary -- I chuck in carrots, celery, fist full of parsley, fist full of thyme sprigs, cut an onion or two in half and chuck that in unpeeled (you're going to strain all this stuff out anyway, so I leave all the peels on), some unpeeled garlic cloves and bay leaves.  I add a little salt (not too much because I'll salt it when I get around to opening up the can and using it), and some unground peppercorns.

If I'm feeling adventurous I might add a few whole cloves, but only when I remember.

I'll pull out all my necks, wings and backs out of the freezer and add them and maybe a couple of small birds (I raise chickens and ducks too) or perhaps a duck that is too small to roast on it's own.  I'll boil this away for several hours until it gets nice and concentrated.  I'll pull out the whole birds and pick over the carcasses and use the meat for chicken salad or for soup.  The duck meat makes an especially tasty ""chicken"" salad."
28407,best breakfast foods,"Nah, he needs a mug of coffee while running to the car."
