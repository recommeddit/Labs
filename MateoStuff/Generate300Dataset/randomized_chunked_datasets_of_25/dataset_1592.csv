71212,best movies with a cool twist,"Cabin in the woods ,pandorum"
32515,best vacation resort,"Can Confirm. The swim up bar is dangerous to gingers (who spend 6 hours in it drinking...in the sun). Housekeeping was more than happy to replace every towel in the room, which was used to clean up the mess. A large tip was left.

Oh, and liquor dispensers in the room! 

The nightly shows are also a lot of fun. There was a vendor there that made these beautiful fingerpaintings on tile of the signature Cabo rock formation. I bought 2 of them, and they're hanging up in my office.

The Steakhouse there has one of the best pieces of cooked meat I've ever had."
63018,Best online React course,"[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/browse/frameworks/react) also has a large amount of free react courses - in the format I like screencasts to be...very fast and concise.

When I was starting out with Redux and testing react apps I found the tutorials to be very helpful, not sure how good the entry-level course is...but Kent Dodds is a good instructor."
26285,best politician,Fidel Castro or Salvador Allende.
68627,best science fiction novel,Huh. I got through the first two volumes of The Reality Dysfunction series and lost interest due to fragmented plot and an onslaught of woo-woo. I take it this one follows through?

*""I was just a child when the stars fell from the skies. But I remember how they built a cannon to destroy them, and in turn, how that cannon brought war upon us...*

The recent AC games are an embarrassment."

Back to the topic: I pick 93 til infinity it was the first album I heard by Hiero/Souls and it just stuck with me. I personally enjoy Full circle more then 3rd eye vision (will listen to 3rd eye tonight though)."
69879,best major to study in college,"Be prepared for a shit storm of work. I'm studying for the CPA right now and it's more work than anything I did in college (and that says a lot). Accounting is a lot of work and even more work in the real world, but it can be rewarding"

33446,best electric car,"You know that’s how *concepts* work, right?"
57734,best cologne,"Mont Blanc Legend is my sort and I also love Gucci Guilty. As other mentionned, a perfume is a memory trigger. Go around and smell them, you can even ask for little sample bottles which last for a few nights, it really gives you the experience !"
28908,best breakfast foods,"I've been making banana oat pancakes lately, they only take about 5-10 minutes.  All you really need is a banana, 1/3C of oats and an egg, but I like to add pecans or walnuts, some cinnamon, pinch of salt, baking powder for a little leavening, and some vanilla extract.  Only takes a minute longer, but you can add or pare down to your taste and convenience.  Just blend up the oats to a powder, add banana, egg, whatever else you want, blend to a batter consistency and fry up like any other pancake.

It's best if you let the batter rest for five minutes, I use that time to make tea and empty the drain rack, but it's not a big deal if you cook them right away if you have no time.  If you preheat your pan while you're making batter, you can have a hot, balanced breakfast in 5 minutes."
16043,best sunglasses for fashion,"I thought I was going to be the type of person who bought a bunch of cheapo sunglasses and just went through them, but with my dear MIL's influence I now somehow have two pairs of Chanel sunglasses. These are also the only Chanel items I own.
