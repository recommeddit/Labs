Oh, and liquor dispensers in the room! 

The nightly shows are also a lot of fun. There was a vendor there that made these beautiful fingerpaintings on tile of the signature Cabo rock formation. I bought 2 of them, and they're hanging up in my office.

28908,"I've been making banana oat pancakes lately, they only take about 5-10 minutes.  All you really need is a banana, 1/3C of oats and an egg, but I like to add pecans or walnuts, some cinnamon, pinch of salt, baking powder for a little leavening, and some vanilla extract.  Only takes a minute longer, but you can add or pare down to your taste and convenience.  Just blend up the oats to a powder, add banana, egg, whatever else you want, blend to a batter consistency and fry up like any other pancake.

It's best if you let the batter rest for five minutes, I use that time to make tea and empty the drain rack, but it's not a big deal if you cook them right away if you have no time.  If you preheat your pan while you're making batter, you can have a hot, balanced breakfast in 5 minutes.",best breakfast foods
