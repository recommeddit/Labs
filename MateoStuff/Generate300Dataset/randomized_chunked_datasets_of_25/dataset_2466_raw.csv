">If I‘m stressed I can throw it across the room and it‘ll still work!

Maybe, but I'd count yourself very lucky if that was the case. Facts are that plastic is an inherently weaker material than aluminum or stainless steel, which made the iPhone 5c one of the weakest iPhones built to date. I severely doubt that most people could just chuck a plastic phone across a room and *not* have it crack somewhere."

"My dad is an accountant and when I was younger he had a client who lived in LA but owned  some time shares in Whistler, BC and never used them. We are from Vancouver and because my dad was really the only person he knew here he would let use these places when it was his turn. The nicest place we stayed was a house that at the time was worth over $3 million. It was incredible. The floors were heated and I remember not even knowing that was a thing. For years after that place was my motivation to do well in school because I wanted to be able to afford a place like it one day.  My dad started working for another firm  shortly after so unfortunately he doesn't get those perks anymore."
"Yeah screw that, 120hz minimum for me"
This is great!

Nothing. Nothing at all. I like the natural smell of a man.

"The gum protection portion of a toothpaste is in reference to an anti-gingivitis chemical called triclosan. 

Personally, I use a toothpaste that has both flouride and triclosan, and I brush for nearly 3 minutes instead of two every time I brush. I don't use toothpastes with the ""extra whitening"" because I have nice teeth already brushing the way I do, and eating as well as I do."

"Hi, Dad here, I have to wake up at 430 so I can have coffee before my wife wakes up at 5 so she can have coffee so I can answer her questions before the child wakes up so that she can answer her questions... fuck."
Really liked Blaze when I lived in IV.
"That should be plenty powerful. I still use [this one](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Texas-Instruments-TI-84-Plus-Programmable-Graphing-Calculator-10-Digit-LCD/3136045?athcpid=3136045&athpgid=athenaItemPage&athcgid=null&athznid=PWVUB&athieid=v0&athstid=CS020&athguid=466001f5-46cfa622-514080189a18a716&athena=true), it got me all the way through calculus and differential equations (got it when I started algebra 1). Looks like the one you've picked out is similar with just some different display options. 

&#x200B;

Calculus is a lot about how graphs behave, so the most important thing is to be able to display the graph nicely and be able to manipulate it a bit.

Some people really seem to like [this one](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Texas-Instruments-TI-Nspire-CX-Handheld-Graphing-Calculator-with-Full-Color-Display/16386512?athcpid=16386512&athpgid=athenaItemPage&athcgid=null&athznid=PWVUB&athieid=v0&athstid=CS020&athguid=466001f5-46cfa622-bb4a6d3e9a18a716&athena=true), it's got some added features that can be helpful, but I personally wasn't a fan when I used it myself."
Do we ever really know people??? Lmao... no I'm not I dont like the new hotel policy thst they inspect the room every day
RO water tastes significantly worse for coffee than simple carbon filters.

"*  1.Great Adventure (Beautiful property and forest. Great Intamins and Beemers, Top tier RmC coming, and a Wildlife park to put it at top)
* 2.Magic Mountain (Best Coasters overall for sure. So much hiking)

* 3.Over Georgia (Not a bad coaster in the park. Good Scenery, some unique classics)

* 4a.Great America (Again well rounded , but no coasters that are the absolute best of their type, some meh rides.)

* 4b.Over Texas (Almost the same as Great America, just maybe a little less polished. Weird Layout issues)

* 6.Fiesta Texas (Great top 2, the best scenery, actually has shows, however: butt-ugly operations)
* 7.America (A couple of great coasters. Ugly scenery, ops can be bad
* 8.Darien Lake (Great Scenery, Fascination!, but the weakest Collection of rides and also 1 train ops)
* 9.St Louis (Kind of Ugly, Meh rides, Things are often closed. Several rough coasters. Definitely the weakest)

These are the parks I've been to."

That album could be produced tomorrow and still sound amazing.
Vodka Collins with a twist of lime.
"A great big violin. So a viola or maybe even some larger theoretical instrument. 

My reasoning: I would want to have a fretless instrument so that I could experiment with all the nice ratios of notes, but fretted instruments (the piano is also discrete and basically fretted, I'm a guitarist), don't let you get at these nice ratios. There are in fact 41 simple ratios between a unison and an octave, if you consider all possible ratios with numerator <= 16. Western music only considers some of these valid, but for no good reason.

I read the title as a creative one, but practically, guitar or piano or drums would be your answer. Guitar is the easiest and cheapest to get into."
"Yea, but it's still a lifetime improvement project.  That's what's great about it."
"Odyssey, Witcher 3, Spider-Man, Days Gone, honestly you can't really go wrong with most open world RPG's."
