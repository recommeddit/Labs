3334,best webcamera,At what in-game resolution and frame rate? What is the output settings of your stream? What CPU present for encoding? You can always make your stream look better/keep it consistent while improving your own gaming experience which will make you want to stream longer = more potential success.

30219,best Mexican war to study,"It sounds like the NY education system failed you then. It’s considerably more nuanced than that, I’d recommend the Wikipedia page to start with."
4951,best home improvement store,"Im surprised menards is not a preferred store for everyone. Menards has better pricing than Home Depot and Lowe’s and better selections. I go to HD because i have one really close but if i need a better selection, always menards. 

I have to start experiencing ace hardware more but don’t have one too close. And Lowe’s is overpriced and far!"

These aren't necessarily my favourites but I think all of them are extremely worthwhile to watch"
72348,best keyboard switches,"I’m mainly into tactiles, so MOD-M’s are my current favorite. Also really like Ergo Clears, Zealios 67g, and the new Outemu SKY v2.2. 

For clickies, I like BOX Whites and BOX Jades. 

I have yet to try linears I like. I couldn’t get used to Reds or Tealios (although I liked how smooth they felt). I’ll have to give Vintage Blacks a try considering how many people recommend them. Thinking about Gateron Yellows too. Any recommendations would be appreciated!"

43840,best items under $100,"My Rocketbook Everlast notebooks come to mind.  They are reusable notebooks that pair with a phone app so you can scan your notes and send them directly to a number of places you pre-set (such as emails, Google Drive folders, etc.). The notebook pages come clean when you whipe them with a damp cloth. It's incredible. I never lose track of my notes anymore and I love that I'm not wasting paper every time I draw a doodle. 

Edit: comment used to say Rocketbook Wave, but that's actually an older and far inferior model."

56539,best desktop monitor,"I got the AOC G2460PF for ~$200, and it was perfect for my intro to high refresh rate gaming.  Loved it so much that I just bought the Acer Predator XB272 (240Hz) last week for $400.  If you find yourself liking the 144Hz experience but don't feel the need to move up to 240Hz, you can upgrade to 1440p 165Hz after a while.

Just my personal opinion, but once I went 144Hz, I only wanted more."

70320,best major to study in college,"I took a class about psychology as a profession and learned that I would need to get a PhD or PsyD in order to really use my psychology degree for psychology (unless I wanted to be a mental health tech at a hospital or something, which is sort of grunt work). When I started looking online to apply for jobs with my new psychology degree, a lot of the jobs seemed really stressful and undesirable (low pay, unpaid training, etc.) at the BA or BS level. I aldo realized that I probably chose psychology in order to learn about myself and that I actually really don't want to be a therapist or a case worker or have any job where I'll be responsible for another person's health. I did a big research project that was really fun, but I don't really want to go into research because it was also stressful. A degree in psychology can be useful in many fields, so I'm thankful I will have a degree in psychology, but I don't really want to work in the field of psychology. I'm passionate about mental health activism and find psychology incredibly interesting, but I don't want the pressure of having to make those things a career.

When I first started looking at going to college, I really wanted to pursue English and creative writing. I abandoned that dream, though, because I was worried that I wouldn't be able to have a stable career, and my English teachers all recommended not getting a degree in English. This past year, though, I took a grammar class and a sociolinguistics class and LOVED them! I came up with a few ideas for some cool projects I'm excited about! I figure that I'll always be able to have a career in something I'm passionate about if I really love it and work hard. I can combine my knowledge of psychology and my love for English and specialize in sociolinguistics.

I'm also really interested in audio engineering/music production. I mix my own music and home and really enjoy it. I would love to be able to help other musicians bring their dreams into reality by producing a sound that's perfect for them. I'm looking into some audio engineering programs as well.

Hope this helps!"
