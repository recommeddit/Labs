For clickies, I like BOX Whites and BOX Jades. 

I have yet to try linears I like. I couldn’t get used to Reds or Tealios (although I liked how smooth they felt). I’ll have to give Vintage Blacks a try considering how many people recommend them. Thinking about Gateron Yellows too. Any recommendations would be appreciated!",best keyboard switches

They are reusable notebooks that pair with a phone app so you can scan your notes and send them directly to a number of places you pre-set (such as emails, Google Drive folders, etc.). The notebook pages come clean when you whipe them with a damp cloth. It's incredible. I never lose track of my notes anymore and I love that I'm not wasting paper every time I draw a doodle.

If you find yourself liking the 144Hz experience but don't feel the need to move up to 240Hz, you can upgrade to 1440p 165Hz after a while.

Just my personal opinion, but once I went 144Hz, I only wanted more.",best desktop monitor

70320,"I took a class about psychology as a profession and learned that I would need to get a PhD or PsyD in order to really use my psychology degree for psychology (unless I wanted to be a mental health tech at a hospital or something, which is sort of grunt work). When I started looking online to apply for jobs with my new psychology degree, a lot of the jobs seemed really stressful and undesirable (low pay, unpaid training, etc.) at the BA or BS level. I aldo realized that I probably chose psychology in order to learn about myself and that I actually really don't want to be a therapist or a case worker or have any job where I'll be responsible for another person's health. I did a big research project that was really fun, but I don't really want to go into research because it was also stressful. A degree in psychology can be useful in many fields, so I'm thankful I will have a degree in psychology, but I don't really want to work in the field of psychology. I'm passionate about mental health activism and find psychology incredibly interesting, but I don't want the pressure of having to make those things a career.

When I first started looking at going to college, I really wanted to pursue English and creative writing. I abandoned that dream, though, because I was worried that I wouldn't be able to have a stable career, and my English teachers all recommended not getting a degree in English. This past year, though, I took a grammar class and a sociolinguistics class and LOVED them! I came up with a few ideas for some cool projects I'm excited about! I figure that I'll always be able to have a career in something I'm passionate about if I really love it and work hard. I can combine my knowledge of psychology and my love for English and specialize in sociolinguistics.

I'm also really interested in audio engineering/music production. I mix my own music and home and really enjoy it. I would love to be able to help other musicians bring their dreams into reality by producing a sound that's perfect for them. I'm looking into some audio engineering programs as well.

Hope this helps!",best major to study in college
