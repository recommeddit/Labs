"If you're checking a bag, you don't really want to lock it.  TSA is going to break anything they can easily open.

Not saying it's right, but it's how they work."

"Off hand....uh-huh Bernie Sanders,john McAfee,Trey Gowdy. Those stand out to me right now, there's more, no doubt, but these are the ones at the front of my brain. I could vote for any of those guys and sleep well."
"I prefer mint. Yes the mobile app is wonky sometimes, but that is easily fixed by just using the web interface for some things."
So that's why I got the free upgrade at Motel 6 when I checked in as Jack Ryan.
"The Diamond Age started out conceptually amazing, was good for 60-75% of the book, then sort of drunkenly stumbled to a mumbly conclusion I thought.  Did anyone else feel that way or is it just me?"
"Haha! That was me too. Tried to cut down on calories by switching to single tall gin and tonics from beer. After doing that for a week or two a more nutrition conscious friend asked why I switched. 

He literally spit out his beer when I told him it was to cut calories, then explained how poor a decision that was when he was done laughing."
"They can also live 20+ years and when they bury themselves to only they can go down for days, weeks, months, or even a year. There will be long periods where you have pet substrate.

Furthermore, they should never be handled. They need the humidity in the tank to breath. Holding stresses them out and gives no benefit to the crab."
"Vegetable soup (Minestrone or something). Getting as much nutrition as you can definitely helps.

After that take some Nyquil or Tylenol PM to go to sleep and let your body take care of itself.

If you're thirsty, drink some Gatorade."

"I use two applications, Timepage and Actions, that integrate with each other. It has all the functionality I need, but maybe not as crazy feature rich as Fantastical. The WHY to use these apps are really the beautiful design and user-friendly layout.

"Some of my favorites include The Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Final Fantasy 15, Dead Rising 4, Dying Light, and the Far Cry series. I'm currently about 50 hours into Persona 5 and I've been loving the experience. Very stylish and awesome music, as well. I'm not sure how well my recommendations will help you, considering I hated AC Origins and Odyssey, Horizon Zero Dawn, Life is Strange (is that considered an RPG?) and the new God of War. Seems you like open-world games or choice-based games. Good luck in your search!"
"This isn't exactly a website/app, it's still Desmos, but jerks like me have been forcing the calculator into 3D with a few linear algebra tricks. Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but here's a 3D vector field in Desmos. Graph contains a link to my website where you can explore the AP Calculus BC or Multivariable Calculus page if you're looking for something else.

"Tap water with 6 stage reverse osmosis filter. If I must choose a brand, I once drank a bottle labeled Pond Water."
Edited to add.
"I'm going to go with ukulele. Small fretboard, easy chords, four strings, portable, relatively cheap, sounds pleasant (even if you don't know what you're doing)."

"To each their own I guess! I too like the general look of the Clubmasters, but I think that the lenses are far too round and tend to [dominate the face rather than accenting it](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cj_Dk730nBs/maxresdefault.jpg)."
"I'm evaluating different services right now (so this thread is awesome timing).

I liked Mint, but last time I used them they didn't have support for RSA key fob things.  That's a big deal for me since several of my bank accounts use them.

YNAB gets all sorts of praise, that one is next on my list.  Also, it's not free."
I don't know what kind of doomsday that is where people are still fancy enough to put fucking saffron on their food.
Script kiddies...
"It’s crazy seeing so many AFC north guys up here, with some in similar positions!

Jesse/Minkah at free safety both in the top 30, even though I personally think Minkah should be ranked higher than Jesse.

Watt/Garrett both going to be in the top ten

Browns OL has a ton of guys on here, as well as the RB running behind it.

Hell, even the Ravens got an RB on the list!"
"Don't Like is crazy how does that ""miss"" you"
"I would go with a PS4 as long as it’s a decent deal. You should be able to get one sub $200 especially if it’s a slim or the first version. Also they will have games with it. Hopefully TLoU is one of them (amazing game btw, story is good within the first few minutes)."
