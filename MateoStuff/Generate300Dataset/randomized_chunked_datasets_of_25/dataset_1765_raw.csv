"The vor game is just one huge, glorious, xanatos pileup."
"Gosh that combo sounds nice. I bet it's pretty refreshing, too."
"The biggest question here is ""what are your friends playing on?"" If that isn't part of the equation for you personally, it really just comes down to what exclusives. I think moooooost people would be of the mindset that PlayStation is the winner here. 

Other things to consider though would be something like Xbox Gamepass, which is Xbox ""Netflix of video games"" like service that is becoming better every month."
Go UNC!

Bosch = Amazon prime

The Shield = Hulu

"I did some painting for a living, as part of apartment maintenance.  We used real wool nap rollers, and they rocked.  For walls, we used a roller that I believe was 18"" wide, with 3/4"" nap.  It would hold a monsterous amount of paint.  We had a paint tray that would hold at least a gallon, maybe two.  It was shaped so that you could pick it up with one hand, and it would rotate and act sort of like a bucket, and allow you to carry all that paint securely that way.  Alas, they stopped making those trays!

To paint raised-panel doors, we used a roller that was 9"" or maybe 12"", that had 1.5"" nap.  Seriously.  One and a half inches.  Flap-flop-splat, except that it didn't send any paint splattering around, it delivered it to the door, nicely reaching right down into those ""raised panel"" recesses.  Then I'd go over it with a brush.  I could paint a full door in a couple of minutes, all nicely brushed in."
Paste Picante ?  before or after my breakfast burrito..

"When I was in high school, some guy brought a CD in the weight room that had 13 tracks of Scorpions' Rock You Like A Hurricane. I thought that was pretty hilarious."
">helped me understand the limitations of inferential statistics

Do you mean, more specifically, inference from the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing approach? Inference statistics are OK. Almost all statistical conclusions *are inference* â€” even those Bayesian weirdos."

Good list but needs MMLP
"Leviathan and YS? Two big rides, but Carowinds, Cedar Point, and Kings Island both got two new B&Ms as well, and thatâ€™s just in Cedar Fair."
Apparently not according to research scoring. But probably yes according to other things.
