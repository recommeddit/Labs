60202,best freezer brand,Was going to say the same. They bought the appliance division of GE but otherwise didn't change anything in North America regarding design and production. Been one of the most reliable brands for refrigeration for us.
8412,best toothpaste,Yup! I brushed too hard as well
31893,best hotel to live in,how about them apples
43231,best detective show,"Six Feet Under 10/10 

Best series ending ever"
14651,best romantic novel,"Historical romance - The Malory series by Johanna Lindsey, but only the first 7 books. The 8th book onwards seems like an artificial attempt to stretch the magic of the seven books, but nah, doesn't quite capture the same magic. The first 7 books though, woww! They are amazing. And I have recommended this series quite a few times in this group. And I've said this before too, when my sister and I first read them, we used to discuss about the Malory clan so much that our mum once thought we were talking about some close family members and asked which relatives we were talking about. 
Not many people seem to recommend Johanna Lindsey, I don't know why. But she does have some superb works. Her other series like the Cardinia Family series (2 works), Sherring Cross series (3 works) and quite a few stand alone novels are really good. If and when you get the time after wading through the amazing works recommended till now, do give The Malory Clan a try. They won't disappoint, I promise!"
24160,best anime,"Not in order:

Shinsekai Yori - Read the mal entry.

Steins;Gate - Starts weak, ends strong. One of the best anime ever made as said by others.

Chihayafuru - You don't have any reason to skip this anime even if you don't like SoL/Romance.

Kingdom - The anime is so-so, but still a must see for me. Also, i think this is like one of the best shounen manga ever made, i'd choose Kingdom over Naruto and Fairy Tail any day. Of course, imo HxH still tops shounen category. One Piece is still strong, FMA was too good, Rurouni Kenshin was damn good too, Yu Yu Hakushu was good and Slam Dunk follows Hajimme no Ippo in sports/shounen as top 1 and top  2.

Hunter x Hunter - You have no reason to skip Hunter x Hunter, both 1999 and 2011 series are crafted beautifully, the manga is damn good too. In my case, since Hunter x Hunter is my first manga and anime, HxH has a special place in my heart.

Eureka 7 - If you didn't liked Eureka 7 then i don't like you, Eureka 7 is a must see for me i'd hate you if you don't even wanna try to watch this. IDK why but when i was watching this anime, E7 felt special and different. Same with Hunter x Hunter, this anime will have a special place in my heart.

Honorable mentions: Kara no Kyoukai, FMA:B, Bakuman, Monogatari Series."
65607,best phone service company,Every company has had a data breach at one point. I just want to know which provider is best for iPhones.
58196,best cologne,"I bet you smell amazing. You have fantastic taste. I actually have met the son of the master perfumer of creed, Hanae Mori and Cartier fragrances.  

Edit:  sorry I forgot your question ( don't feel so great) pulse points!! Never your clothing. That will happen as you wear the cologne. Spray your wrist, behind the ear, ankle, behind knee caps or palms. NEVER RUB YOUR WRISTS TOGETHER TO CRUSH the fragrance."
69855,best major to study in college,"Astronomer here!  Good for you! :) Warning: it is *really* hard.  And incredibly competitive at every level, for little pay compared to what you'd get in industry.

That said, I rather love what I do, and can't believe I get paid for it, so ask if you have any questions! (Edit: for those interested, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/31omlf/so_you_want_to_be_an_astronomer/) is a good post to get you started on what astronomers do, and how to become one...)

Edit 2: some of my personal pros and cons from further downstream

Pros: getting paid to increase my level of understanding about the universe, teaching is a joy, as is writing, and my colleagues are incredibly wonderful.  And when it works *wow*, there's nothing cooler than knowing something in the universe no one else knows!

Cons: stuff doesn't work a *lot* so everything takes way longer than you think it will, I don't like programming but really need to do a decent amount of it, and sometimes the people I work with can be incredibly frustrating (amazingly, not always completely different people from those listed under the pros)"
29721,best money managing app,"I'm going to second ynab, a lot of budgeting apps will be monthly and based around salary+monthly expenses. ynab is different in that you put in income, and then assign it to the budget, making a lot more flexible for when paychecks have different amounts, but still letting you track where money is going and plan it out really well."
54793,best water filter,"I've had my [Soma](https://www.drinksoma.com/) filter for a number of years now. Love it! Tastes good and the carafe is beautiful, but even better they're an eco-conscious company."
25741,best cricket teams of all time,"India- Great Batsmen, Great Spinners, Crowd Pullers

West Indies- Fearsome Five (fastest bowlers of their times, batsmen were literally shit scared to face them), Gary Sobers(36 off one over), Brian Lara(400*), first world cup winners.

South Africa- Quality Team, Depth, Never lacking in the fast bowling department, Great All-rounders, One remarkable wicket keeper, 438 and choking.

England- Pioneers of the game, Home grounds help swing bowlers, Hire and Fire Captains, Depth in County Cricket

Australia- Will go all out pace with 5 bowlers if possible, Almost every bowler is a capable of leading the attack. Most WC wins, Great Batsmen, Aggressive captains, Mind Games.

Pakistan- In-Swing, Reverse Swing, Doosra all kinds of bowlers but never slow bowlers, Batsmen with lots of talent, any one of their players is good enough to defeat another team."

15957,best sunglasses for fashion,"Not really worth it to me. I live in AZ and I have a real need for shades but still I think this. 

>I seem to be buying at least 2 pairs every summer since they break so easily.

Keep them out of your car and the heat and they will last a long while. I've owned $1 sunglasses last over a year before finally succumbing. I also place them in a protective pouch. The heft is noticeable between expensive and non-expensive sunglasses, which is important to some. I honestly don't care though and can't justify expensive sunglasses that I wear 90% of the time alone while driving. I guess it depends on how often and where you will be using them."
38692,best newspapers to read,Could someone tell me what the yearly subscriptions to various newspapers would be?
55700,best action and adventure novel series,"Shit, you're pretty much right. But the action parts are so intense they make the rest worth it. But, I disagree those scenes are pointless."
30494,best Mexican war to study,*A Glorious Defeat* talks about the Mexican-American war and how it shaped the Mexican Identity. Very good read.
42147,movies like Inception,"To be honest, the open-endedness of the two movies is what appeals to me the most."
65392,best phone service company,"Depends where you're at and your phone. If you're traveling domestically too, you can't go wrong with VZW...they keep adding macro sites in suburban and rural areas too. 5G NSA hasn't made much difference for everyone, so like as stated above, try prepaid."
46635,best trick or treating candy,Alvin Kamara
68897,best science fiction novel,"I'm gonna just be honest, i really hope you take it that way, i have no interest in an argument or ideological shenanigans. 

I want a good book, i don't care, at all, about the characteristics of the author. A lot of places/people do, they will explicitly say they are recommending a book because it's written by a certain characteristic or has a certain characteristic represented within. I can't then trust those reviews. Instead of thinking 'oh cool a new book by a really well reviewed young author' i have to consider if it's an ideological choice. I don't even necessarily begrudge those people their right to choose and promote things that agree with their worldview. i Just don't have any interest in sharing it and if it negatively affects the quality of the book i might buy and read, i don't want any part of it. 

I'm just someone who likes Sci Fi, my knowledge of awards is the stickers that get printed on the books for the most part and i'm not even American. I had to google what the Puppies movement was and it feels like a wilful mischaracterisation of this sub to be honest."
