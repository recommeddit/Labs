14651,"Historical romance - The Malory series by Johanna Lindsey, but only the first 7 books. The 8th book onwards seems like an artificial attempt to stretch the magic of the seven books, but nah, doesn't quite capture the same magic. The first 7 books though, woww! They are amazing. And I have recommended this series quite a few times in this group. And I've said this before too, when my sister and I first read them, we used to discuss about the Malory clan so much that our mum once thought we were talking about some close family members and asked which relatives we were talking about. 
Not many people seem to recommend Johanna Lindsey, I don't know why. But she does have some superb works. Her other series like the Cardinia Family series (2 works), Sherring Cross series (3 works) and quite a few stand alone novels are really good. If and when you get the time after wading through the amazing works recommended till now, do give The Malory Clan a try. They won't disappoint, I promise!",best romantic novel
24160,"Not in order:

Shinsekai Yori - Read the mal entry.

Steins;Gate - Starts weak, ends strong. One of the best anime ever made as said by others.

Chihayafuru - You don't have any reason to skip this anime even if you don't like SoL/Romance.

Kingdom - The anime is so-so, but still a must see for me. Also, i think this is like one of the best shounen manga ever made, i'd choose Kingdom over Naruto and Fairy Tail any day. Of course, imo HxH still tops shounen category. One Piece is still strong, FMA was too good, Rurouni Kenshin was damn good too, Yu Yu Hakushu was good and Slam Dunk follows Hajimme no Ippo in sports/shounen as top 1 and top  2.

Hunter x Hunter - You have no reason to skip Hunter x Hunter, both 1999 and 2011 series are crafted beautifully, the manga is damn good too. In my case, since Hunter x Hunter is my first manga and anime, HxH has a special place in my heart.

Eureka 7 - If you didn't liked Eureka 7 then i don't like you, Eureka 7 is a must see for me i'd hate you if you don't even wanna try to watch this. IDK why but when i was watching this anime, E7 felt special and different. Same with Hunter x Hunter, this anime will have a special place in my heart.

Honorable mentions: Kara no Kyoukai, FMA:B, Bakuman, Monogatari Series.",best anime

That said, I rather love what I do, and can't believe I get paid for it, so ask if you have any questions! (Edit: for those interested, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/31omlf/so_you_want_to_be_an_astronomer/) is a good post to get you started on what astronomers do, and how to become one...)

Edit 2: some of my personal pros and cons from further downstream

Pros: getting paid to increase my level of understanding about the universe, teaching is a joy, as is writing, and my colleagues are incredibly wonderful.  And when it works *wow*, there's nothing cooler than knowing something in the universe no one else knows!

Cons: stuff doesn't work a *lot* so everything takes way longer than you think it will, I don't like programming but really need to do a decent amount of it, and sometimes the people I work with can be incredibly frustrating (amazingly, not always completely different people from those listed under the pros)",best major to study in college

Keep them out of your car and the heat and they will last a long while. I've owned $1 sunglasses last over a year before finally succumbing. I also place them in a protective pouch. The heft is noticeable between expensive and non-expensive sunglasses, which is important to some.

I want a good book, i don't care, at all, about the characteristics of the author. A lot of places/people do, they will explicitly say they are recommending a book because it's written by a certain characteristic or has a certain characteristic represented within. I can't then trust those reviews. Instead of thinking 'oh cool a new book by a really well reviewed young author' i have to consider if it's an ideological choice. I don't even necessarily begrudge those people their right to choose and promote things that agree with their worldview. i Just don't have any interest in sharing it and if it negatively affects the quality of the book i might buy and read, i don't want any part of it. 

I'm just someone who likes Sci Fi, my knowledge of awards is the stickers that get printed on the books for the most part and i'm not even American. I had to google what the Puppies movement was and it feels like a wilful mischaracterisation of this sub to be honest.",best science fiction novel
