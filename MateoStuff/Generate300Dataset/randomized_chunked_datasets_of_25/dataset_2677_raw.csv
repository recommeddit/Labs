then give him a roundhouse kick and run off without feeling any remorse whatsoever.
"The only one of those games I've played is **New York Zoo** but my wife and I have enjoyed it a lot. I'm at least vaguely aware of everything else on the list... Whistle Mountain and Viscounts are even on my shelf, just haven't gotten to try them out yet."

">And if you decide streaming isn't for you or it just didn't workout for you, you only spent $20 rather than $70.

This is why I always tell people to start cheap. I have seen multiple online friends decide they want to stream, drop hundreds (or in one case thousands) of dollars on equipment, and then give up streaming after a couple months.

Start small! If it goes well, take the money you get from bits/subs/donos and buy new equipment. It's a win-win because your viewers see that their donos are going towards improving the stream, and you're not spending savings on equipment you may only use for a few months or a year."
Shhhiiiiit i forgot about DangerDoom! Mouse and the mask is most definetely a top ten banger.

"Does the brown color of the raiden stick out like a sore thumb? I'm a little worried that it wouldn't look good with the rest of my setup, which is mostly black/white. I had the shidenkai for about a year and removed it's top glass layer after it burned out. Ive been thinking about getting the raiden."
What is DMT?
"That's fair, but that doesn't really teach me to maybe find budget shoes because I at least know what I'm looking for."
"Physics MPhys, one of my project supervisors put it best.

""You'll come out knowing more maths than anyone but a mathematician, more about experimental procedure than anyone but a biologist/chemist, more about computer programming than anyone but a computer scientist (even more than some), more about material science than anyone but a material scientist and more about engineering than anyone but an engineer""

EDIT: You do end up knowing some physics too (hopefully), I should add.

It's difficult but honestly I like that, it makes me feel like it's been worth doing it. Very marketable jobs-wise too. About half of my final year has been to do with particle physics too, my project involved CERN, so I agree on that."
"Yup its awesome, frontend masters is one of the best , but OP requested for Udemy , so had to suggest him the best one I know."
"Been almost a week I believe.

"A used RX480 8Gb can take you a long way as you can find some for around 100$, but that's about cheap GPU, not really in your budget in a way.

A 5600XT or 1080TI would be your best bet, at around 300$ used. Don't forget to get some thermal paste and thermal pads in case you want to buy used, so you don't run in any overheating issue. 

Or wait for a sale on a 5700XT."
"Agreeing, the 6th one was pretty good too but they def should have stopped at 3 and wrapped it the fuck up."
"Neo vs wolverine

Who wins?"
are they illegal in any state/city? it would be a shame to be tripped up in someone stupid like DC or NYC.
"My Mom literally hated (almost) everything everyone ever got for her for Christmas. She was polite enough when presented with whatever it was but would get snarky later. 

We all knew this and so didn't expend much effort after a while.

Well, one year, I bought this stainless steel tea-kettle at I think it was Ross or Marshall's or something (some cheap department store anyway) for my boyfriend's mom - it was cheap-ish, couldn't have been more than $20. 

Well me & the BF had a huge fight right before Christmas and I was clearly dis-invited to anything they had going on. So I wrapped up this tea-kettle and gave it to Mom instead. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. She used it for like the next 20 years and it was still on the stove when my Dad decided she had to go to a nursing home."
hey i was just wondering what size you would recommend for a school bag? i’ve been looking to get one and not sure if the regular one will be big enough for notebook/my small laptop or if the 15” laptop bag is the way to go
What did you think of *A Canticle for Leibowitz?*
"Maison Kurkdjian Amyris Femme

Byredo Bal d’ Afrique 

Jo Malone Wild Bluebell

Mostly very feminine sweet fragrances"
Not sure.... what do you mean?
"Alas, I'm not in the US and where I am right now, most of the testers are nicked by the staff themselves and they deny giving it out :c

I'm trying to finish off whatever craptastic ones I got gifted (some floral smelling garbage from Banana Republic called Classic and some sickly sweet thing from Burberry that makes me sneeze) and then I'll buy a new fragrance. Currently high on my list are:

a) Acqua Di Gio

b) CK One

c) L'eau D'Issey

d) Paco Rabanne (I was really surprised by this - it smelled a lot nicer than I expected it to be and it lasted *ages*)"
"You have to admit, you picked a strange way to say whatever you're saying."
"I have Pentiums, celerons and Athlons in my personal Museum and atm i have 20$ X5675 @4.2GHz which is 25% slower than 3300X in cinebench r20 so yes it's expensive in my terms and comparing it with other ryzens."
