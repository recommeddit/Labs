I used Wacom and preview in Mac. If you open your pdf in preview your Wacom should be supported for markup.
"I read The Hindu, we have been reading The Hindu since I was a kid. These days I buy paper but I don't actually read them everyday. I scan headlines and speed read the front page to see if anything interests me.

In college days, we used to solve The Hindu crossword :-)

Long time ago when I used to live in Bombay, if you wanted to buy The Hindu, you visit Andheri Station around afternoon. That were you could buy it."
For the lack of the 5 1600 AF. Most consumers will head to 3600 or 3600x of AMD. Not bad for gaming and some editing the 1600 af was. But it is what it is. Stocks of af are swashed and hide now the af to raise its $$$$. Shame.
"I'm pretty sure the implication is that the blood is coming from the corpse, not from his genitalia."
"The crazy amount of sugar in the Gatorade will actually make the hangover worse.

Edit: I don't have a source I can link you to, and I can't imagine where I would find an academic paper or equally reputable source on the effects of combining Gatorade with binge drinking. My source is my own personal experience with seriously nasty hangovers that resulted in drinking a tried and true amount of alcohol where the only x factor was the addition of sugary drinks."
I've also heard to brush in circles. I think both of these methods are just tricks to get you to brush lighter.
"I'd say third or fourth. To me they're about as big as Liverpool or Bayern, but the success in the past ten years or so obviously ups their standing internationally."
"A couple.  The Ritz on Maui was the most formally nice.  The coolest is an Air BNB in Wisconsin called,  Adeline‚Äôs House of Cool."
I once found out my friends were throwing me a surprise birthday party. I got so anxious I didn't go. This was before everyone had mobiles so no-one could reach me during. It's the only party I've ever had thrown and I regret it massively 14 years later.
"I love My Struggle. Temperature is a banger of an opener, My Pain got added to my ‚Äúam I sad or just vibin?‚Äù playlist"
"I feel bad for you about Usual Suspects. Such a masterpiece, and throw whatever you want at me, but Sixth Sense twist was kind of predictable."
"Sadly, my dslr doesn‚Äôt have hdmi pass through!!! 
(Fuji xt-10)‚Ä¶ i have to use my rx-100 (sony) with a crop in past to remove the interface‚Ä¶."
I've been using superagent for backend. If I'm writing tests I can also use supertest which has the same api for the most part. Since superagent implements \`then\` you can await the request object.
Egg. Library doesn't carry half the books I read.
Swiss francs
"I went from Kubuntu (2011-2014) to Manjaro (2014-now).  I do not regret starting with Ubuntu, but I think I would just have started with Manjaro nowadays.

Manjaro, W10 and ChromeOS are ""rolling"" so going back to non-rolling (MACOS, Ubuntu, Mint) would be too much of a step back for me.

I would go for KDE-Plasma and Install Gnome as well so you can occasionally switch between them. I have found I like Cinnamon and KDE best. DEs can just be installed and uninstalled, so you can always switch."
Whiskey and ginger ale.
"After a few days a hard hit of marijuana will give you about 20 mins of normality again. Enjoy it, it comes right back when it wears off, and won't work again."
Honestly I always buy cheap cases from Walmart or TJ Maxx and they always work for me üòÄ
"Are you looking to develop on linux, or are just curious about using it as a desktop?"
I just don‚Äôt use the belt attachment thing that comes with the case. *Those* people are truly psychopaths
Is he though? Is he an acquired taste?
"I'm sure you found the other links in the comments.. [this one's pretty good too, though.](http://i.imgur.com/6HNG4.gif)"
Sounds like I'm moving to Vietnam then.
YES!!! it‚Äôs amazing how good he is with his editing even in his 6 year old vids!
