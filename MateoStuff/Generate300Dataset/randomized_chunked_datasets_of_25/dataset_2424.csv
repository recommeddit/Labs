5928,"What I did was browse around Reddit (/r/software, iirc) and looked for people asking for tools that didn't exist and seemed relatively simple.

For example, one person asked for a display similar to ones on sports talkshows where you enter in a list of topics and a time limit, then it builds a list of the topics and scrolls through them.

So since performance is the biggest concern, I would pick between the ASUS ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (if you're specifically looking for value), the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (best overall device because of higher wattage GPU + MUX switch), and MSI GE66 Raider (good alternative to Legion 5 Pro).",best laptop for general use
