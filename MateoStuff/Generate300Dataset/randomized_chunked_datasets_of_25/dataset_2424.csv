37277,best amusement park,"I find it hard to believe Knott's is #1 for California. Even excluding Disney, there's still MM."
17558,best iOS game,"That's fine mate,
I can't be even bothered to give a $hit about getting downvoted.
Enjoy your day and thanks for stepping up for me.
Cheers"
55681,best action and adventure novel series,"You're right - The Night's Dawn trilogy is more action-packed than his Commonwealth saga. I just meant that in general he's a great action writer, and that was one of his better scenes."
5928,best programming language for web development,"What I did was browse around Reddit (/r/software, iirc) and looked for people asking for tools that didn't exist and seemed relatively simple.

For example, one person asked for a display similar to ones on sports talkshows where you enter in a list of topics and a time limit, then it builds a list of the topics and scrolls through them.

It was easy to get basic functionality, then I added more graphical sugar, animations, and options. It was cool having something that was useful to someone else, and it's even better if they treat you like some genius with a programming super power."
50904,best rap album,Oh yeah I think it's much better than gkmc. I actually even prefer section 80 over gkmc haha
69420,best major to study in college,"Or the dicks you shake, depending on your sex.

Edit: mmkay"
34198,best NFL player,True football meltdowns are fun
36430,best alcoholic drink,I was wondering what could possibly deserve that name... but that... that fits
71673,best movies with a cool twist,"haha, damn. well. at least i did not know him as famous when i first saw it, and i think it was instrumental to getting fooled"
65219,best phone service company,Easily one of the most anticipated posts on this sub. Thanks for the list u/stetson. It's a resource we point users to when our plans are not a good fit. Just keep an eye out for a major release from us tomorrow.
59814,best perfume,"I still have a bottle that I wear occasionally. I'll be 30 this year and I don't care, ha!"
40743,best instrument to play,Tuba. Right guys? Right?
6331,best Netflix documentary,Winter on Fire
9378,best toothpaste,He was in a loud room when they called him. He misunderstood the question. And thought they were trying to sell him something.
45801,best trick or treating candy,Where has this chart been all my life!
14776,best romantic novel,Armie Hammer is losing his damn mind.
23351,best car racing video game,"What a sad day it is when the Gran Turismo series doesn't even get mentioned as a good car game. I've owned every one in the series and bought all the PS consoles just for the title, other than PS4. Oh how the mighty have fallen. 

BTW, I play Project Cars and love it. Don't play it often anymore, but man its a good game. It's even better if you have a good home audio system!"
30495,best Mexican war to study,"Also Conflict in Mexico. But A Glorious Defeat is a really great read, 10/10 would. 

Conflict in Mexico talks about Pancho Villa all the way to the Cristero War, very very interesting."
51369,best iphone case,"I use the Commuter - little less bulky than the defender but still provides a lot of protection, also has the port cover.   I also prefer my screen to remain naked."
71349,best movies with a cool twist,"The Others. I wasn't expecting the twist and when it happened, it really scared me. Which made my experience of the movie so much better.

I really liked the genre twists in From Dusk Til Dawn and The Guest as well."
39450,best web browser,"I use Chrome (because I am already accustomed, but actually should change to firefox). I've added DuckDuckGo extension that manages my search and a Ghostery extension that blocks unnecessary trackers and malicious stuff that you find on a daily basis while browsing the web ;)"
28643,best breakfast foods,"I taught English in Korea two summers ago, and this sounds almost exactly like what we ate, but I never found it ""heavy"". I was actually really impressed with the balance the meals typically had. From things like the cold cucumber soup to the blazinghotdeath kimchi to the weird burnt rice water, Korean breakfast is one of my favorites."
7533,best laptop for general use,"I see. So since performance is the biggest concern, I would pick between the ASUS ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (if you're specifically looking for value), the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (best overall device because of higher wattage GPU + MUX switch), and MSI GE66 Raider (good alternative to Legion 5 Pro)."
29498,best game console,Well explain.  Because that is Banjo and Kazooie: Butchered and Milked edition.
59415,best perfume,"Something to the effect of toasted marshmallow bonfire from Bath and Body Works. Unfortunately, they didnâ€™t bring it back this fall."
