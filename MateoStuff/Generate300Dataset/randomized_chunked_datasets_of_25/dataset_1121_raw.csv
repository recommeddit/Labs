"The Miracle Morning by Hal Elrod and Vision to Reality by Honoree Corder - Both great reads (perfect together) to setting time blocks and reaching goals.  I actually got to interview Hal Elrod on my podcast (He died for 6 minutes, was told he would never walk again.. then went on to break sales records and run a 52 mile marathon.) His energy is insane!"
"Missing a comma and a couple capitals. If this is you ""not trying to be a dick"", I wonder what dickish heights you could reach if you put your mind to it."
"Broot is wonderful, and more so all the time."
I'm not sure I'd agree.  But I guess it depends on your approach. If you are wiling to put the ernest effort into python and seriously learn the details of the language and a framework or two you can earn a pretty decent salary even without a degree.

it's the closest and quietest
"So much this, I use my old S7 Edge and it looks sooo good. If someone has an old phone laying around, give it a shot."
"Last time I took some of that I felt like I was on a really good stimulant, though it did clear my cold up very well."
"Way too many letters. vim, feh(or eog) and mpv will handle 99.9% of the files I'd want to open."
"I told my girlfriend that this movie was awesome, and has a great twist, and she guessed it within 5 mins because I have a shitty poker face"
"I recently became fed up with the data harvesting that Google does through Chrome. I mean, I knew they did it, but I think that on some level, I was *probably* okay with it... or at least unaware? But they made it too effing obvious with ads for things that I had looked at on Amazon or whimsically researched elsewhere.

So, I installed Microsoft's version of Chrome, don't sign in to it, switched over to uBlock Origin, and block cookies. Then I use extensions to whitelist cookies from sites I want, disable JavaScript on the fly for sites that bitch about cookie blocking, and block videos from autoplaying.

It's been real nice since all those changes.

I wanted to like Firefox, but it's not ready for touch input on Windows, so I had to quit using it after a couple of days testing.

I may end up going to straight Chromium if Microsoft starts getting carried away with tracking and privacy."
While I’m out here never using cases on my phones.
"For me, it's entirely dependent on the situation and the time of year, but my usual go-to is a half rye, half cognac Sazerac.

However, on a hot summer day, NOTHING beats an Aperol Spritz"

"Thanks for the thoughtful reply!  

I did in fact get ""best in show"" of the middle school film festival, but most of the other films didn't have edits or music, so I don't think anyone really entered it with too much of a competitive spirit.  One particular Andy Warhol-esque entry was a kid who filmed himself chasing his dog around the house for 10 minutes.  

I remember my thought process being at the time that I wanted to film mundane stuff in weird ways (hence eating the bagels and everything), but a lot of the film just ended up me looking out a window thinking ""oh, that's kind of pretty"" or something like that.  Definitely didn't have a coherent end goal in mind in terms of tones or themes, as much as I just kind of went ""oh, that's neat and works well with the music""."
That's awesome

I should bottle my diarrhea and under cut them. I could make a small fortune off my poor eating habits!"
"I think the best European player not to be able to make the squad would be Lewandowski, but he wouldn't be missed. That's just how good that squad would be"
"The battle above Scarif was so good. It felt like something from the original trilogy.

It was pretty great seeing remastered Red and Gold Leader footage. Looked so much better and not creepy like Leia and Tarkin."
"If you like greystillplays, modest pelican gaming will be right up your street"
I dunno we kinda came up with the idea ourself! I guess their internet tourism marketing is pretty good. Are there many big football stadiums over in California?
"Heck you can play Destiny, Titanfall and Rise of the Tomb raider too."
"Such a bleak outlook. Anytime a degree is broken down and categorized like this it gets depressing, just get your degree and follow your path."
