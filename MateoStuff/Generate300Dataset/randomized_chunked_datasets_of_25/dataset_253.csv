13728,"We just read this article in a class just below Master's level. I don't know what level you're teaching, but if you're teaching first years students (I don't know the appropriate term, I'm not American), you may like one with less heavy mathematics. I personally like [False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1939912_code713472.pdf?abstractid=1850704&mirid=1) by J. P. Simmons, L. D. Nelson and U Simonsohn a lot too. Although this is mostly relevant for psychology, I feel it can be generalized to other field with little replication and lots of statistical tools, like genetic biology.",best research paper archive

63734,"If you're a procrastinator, like me, you're going to love *The Now Habit* (Fiore). It blew my mind. It will help you understand why you're procrastinating, and how to think and act to become more effective. No magic, just some tactics that really do work.

If you're worrying too much, I recommend *How to Stop Worrying and Start Living* (Carnegie). It's amazing as well!

*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* and *Getting Things Done* are good as well, so read those too, but I would start with *The Now Habit* if I were you. (You can never read too many great books!)",best books for time management reddit

16942,"It’s fun. It’s addicting but the game doesn’t tell you what to do so you can mess things up for yourself in the long run. I started buying land and not upgrading my stuff so I almost literally cant organize crops or anything. My item management sucks too. And my upgrades too. Most of this is my fault, but because there is no rules that are set out, it’s a figure out stuff for yourself type game where multiple saves will be happening and you’ll be better an better each save file.",best iOS game

25961,"England’s 2010-11 Ashes Team is probably our best of recent times. Listed with their averages at the end of 2010:

Strauss (43.02), Cook (46.17), Trott (64.00), KP (48.53), Collingwood (40.82), Bell (43.37), Prior (40.52), Broad (27.40/35.24), Swann (23.50/27.66), Anderson (31.76), Finn (26.23).

Pretty formidable batting line up, and the bowlers only improved from that series (Finn sadly excepted). It’s funny to think that the ‘worst’ batsmen, Collingwood and Prior, have higher averages than the likes of Bairstow and Stokes, two of the best batsmen in our team now.",best cricket teams of all time
