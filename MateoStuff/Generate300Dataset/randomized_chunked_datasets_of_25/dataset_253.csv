13728,best research paper archive,"We just read this article in a class just below Master's level. I don't know what level you're teaching, but if you're teaching first years students (I don't know the appropriate term, I'm not American), you may like one with less heavy mathematics. I personally like [False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1939912_code713472.pdf?abstractid=1850704&mirid=1) by J. P. Simmons, L. D. Nelson and U Simonsohn a lot too. Although this is mostly relevant for psychology, I feel it can be generalized to other field with little replication and lots of statistical tools, like genetic biology."
19774,best YouTube video,"[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), it's a master piece"
63734,best books for time management reddit,"If you're a procrastinator, like me, you're going to love *The Now Habit* (Fiore). It blew my mind. It will help you understand why you're procrastinating, and how to think and act to become more effective. No magic, just some tactics that really do work.

If you're worrying too much, I recommend *How to Stop Worrying and Start Living* (Carnegie). It's amazing as well!

*The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* and *Getting Things Done* are good as well, so read those too, but I would start with *The Now Habit* if I were you. (You can never read too many great books!)"

10896,best suitcase lock,"Actually, they can still get into your bag if your bag has a zipper. Shove a pen in the zipper and it peels open easy. Locks are a false sense of security"
12014,best gifts for dad,"This year is my husband's first father's day too! My ideas so far are a book of dad jokes and one of those cheesy ""#1 DAD"" mugs with our daughter's footprints on it. :) She's too young to make him anything but I still wanted it to be special (and every dad needs a super cool mug haha)."
51716,best iphone case,I went with a totalle case this time. I prefer barely there cases. Would rather not detract from the way the phone looks
16942,best iOS game,"It’s fun. It’s addicting but the game doesn’t tell you what to do so you can mess things up for yourself in the long run. I started buying land and not upgrading my stuff so I almost literally cant organize crops or anything. My item management sucks too. And my upgrades too. Most of this is my fault, but because there is no rules that are set out, it’s a figure out stuff for yourself type game where multiple saves will be happening and you’ll be better an better each save file."

25961,best cricket teams of all time,"England’s 2010-11 Ashes Team is probably our best of recent times. Listed with their averages at the end of 2010:

Strauss (43.02), Cook (46.17), Trott (64.00), KP (48.53), Collingwood (40.82), Bell (43.37), Prior (40.52), Broad (27.40/35.24), Swann (23.50/27.66), Anderson (31.76), Finn (26.23).

Pretty formidable batting line up, and the bowlers only improved from that series (Finn sadly excepted). It’s funny to think that the ‘worst’ batsmen, Collingwood and Prior, have higher averages than the likes of Bairstow and Stokes, two of the best batsmen in our team now."
59740,best perfume,"I got Tom Ford - Black Orchid for Christmas, and it’s really really lovely. It’s sultry & mysterious. I love the patchouli notes. I feel luxurious wearing it, like I should be wearing it for special occasions or date nights. Definitely my favorite right now!"

53242,best usb c charging cable,"As for Choetech, they were one of the first brands to bring out a wireless Qi charger with a USB-C port, and soon followed up with a USB-C-to-C version. And brilliantly cheap too. I don't have any other products from them, but that showed me that they keep an eye on the market."
32360,best hotel to live in,"I can also confirm. I used to work at restaurant inside a hotel that's had a lot of famous people stay in (Tony Hawk, Adam Sandler, Jonas Brother, Justin Bieber, various olympic athletes, etc.) They all went went out of their way to keep a low profile. Channing Tatum was particularly chill.  

I never came across any influencers but the upper middle class families were always the worst to deal with."
17682,best iOS game,"I played it for months, then you run into paywalls and you can only unlock certain type of items after you pay (a lot). It slows progression and a few challenges cannot be completed."
