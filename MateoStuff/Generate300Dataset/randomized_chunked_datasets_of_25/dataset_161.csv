66277,best soccer team in the world,"Don't know about that. Bayern, Liverpool and Barca all have 5 CL titles. Bayern have reached 10 finals, the other 2 have reached 8. Barca have made finals in 5 decades: 1960's, 1980's, 1990's, 2000's and 2010's. Liverpool in 4: 1970's, 1980's, 2000's and 2010's. In terms of spread, Barca wins. 

Guess it depends on whether you value CWC (edit: Cup Winner's Cup) over UEFA Cup. Idk. Barca made 6 CWC finals winning 4, Liverpool 4 UEFA Cup finals winning 3, plus a solitary CWC final loss."

4685,best home improvement store,They were clearancing it out to make room for newer models. I went to three other shops and they couldn't come anywhere close to the $1500 so it definitely wasn't retailing for that low. One of them had it listed at $2200.
28707,best breakfast foods,"*Typical* Austrian breakfast would be Wurstsemmel (kind of like a roll with ham) or some other type of bread with ham, cheese, butter, margarine or jam.

Personally I prefer a croissant with coffee. While I believe Austrian dark bread is the best (when fresh from the oven) the French do know how to make white bread."

70163,best major to study in college,"Nit trying to be a dick or anything but while I can appreciate the desire for a fulfilling career, being poor and having to eke out an existence will put a damper on anything, including your passion for whatever you do. It's not a one extreme or the other, poor/happy or rich/miserable.  On top of that, you should also consider what place family and friends rank in relation to your career as they do require funds at least time to time. These are simply the most financially  lucrative majors and the title is misleading."

You should also checkout the [developers roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) for an overview of what technologies is used in modern web devlopment and it acts as a good guide for what you should be learning."
70961,best movies with a cool twist,"That's my favorite campy horror series. Classic Evil Dead type series.  ""Serious"" horror film becomes intentional parody of it's own self.

*Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhh I'm a happy camper!*

Best part is that they never really reference the twist again. So seeing them out of order doesn't spoil it, and you just randomly remember it while watching the other ones and giggle a bit at the ""secret."""
