60275,"Planned obsolescence is a thing, and since manufacturers are using fewer high quality components in increasingly complicated machines, you have a higher failure rate overall.

As far as holding onto appliances, probably not.  The energy efficiency of recent appliances can offset the cost of buying a new fridge every decade, but this definitely depends on the models you have, the models you buy, and how you take care of them.",best freezer brand

3385,"But I never said someone shouldn't buy the c920. I SPECIFICALLY SAID, ""There is no need in spending more than $20 on a webcam if you're starting."" on a TWITCH reddit. So I'm specifically saying that you don't need to buy a c920 if you're starting as a streamer. You could buy it, of course, but there are other options. 



I created this post, because after asking people here, it seemed that the only webcam I could possibly buy for streaming was the c920, when in reallity, the $40 cheaper c270 is good enough.",best webcamera

32265,"Watching for signs of sex trafficking, lots of cheating spouses there under fake names (and you can’t confirm if they’re there when the spouse calls pissed), jacuzzi and swimming pool deaths (usually from alcohol), guests expose themselves to female staff frequently especially housekeepers and room service, people will legit give you keys to their rooms, sometimes dealing with really shitty organizations for their banquets income, etc. 
One cool thing is that you can buy pillows, mattresses, etc from many hotel brands if you really enjoyed your sleep at a hotel.

Edit re: fake names:
You can use an alias at a hotel. You check in with all your correct legal information, so the hotel has all your info. Then you let them know you’d like to use an alias during your stay and if you’d like to block external calls. So if a civilian calls looking for you, the desk says you’re not there per instructions. IF there is an issue of medical/legal/law enforcement then the desk will provide the correct legal info per local laws. This is something also used by people hiding from abusers too, it’s not always someone being shitty.

My local Lowes is tricky to find stuff, and often related items won't be where you expect to find them. For example, a garbage disposal was in one aisle and the power cord was in a separate section of ""accessories."" 

I'm sure if I spent more time at Lowes that would change, but I know the brands HD carries (like Cree LED bulbs, which I like) and HD is easier to get to, despite them being near each other.",best home improvement store
72845,"well, the lab had a bunch of variants. from gentoo to red had to ubuntu. I started with ubuntu because it is the easiest distribution to transfer to from anything else, particularly if you use Kubuntu- which is a bit windows-like in theme. The installer basically holds your hand, and helps you make the right decisions. 

If you really want to get into linux, definately install arch linux, though. But, I would start by installing ubuntu or something and just get used to working in a command line. Once you  are comfortable there, try an arch linux install. As said, it is really complicated your first time, and you are going to want to do it on a computer that you probably arent otherwise using. That being said, I really love linux, so if you ever have any questions, I can try to help you out =)",best Linux distro
