4752,best home improvement store,"In my case, there is a lowes and HD a block away from each other.  I have been shopping at the 2 for over 10 years and I do quite a bit of home improvement projects.

I have primarily gone to HD because their customer service is hands down way way better than the lowes.  This could simply be a management issue at this particular lowes but over the years I have pretty much done all my shopping at home depot.  Every now and then I don't find exactly what I am looking for and head over to lowes to check and its a ghost town both in customers and customer service.  It is a nightmare trying to get any help there.  so every year home depot gets a couple thousand from me on average and lowes gets my bad reviews."
