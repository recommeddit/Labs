Lol how could you put Dumfries with the rest of those names??
"well it depends on the reason your teeth are sensitive. many people have sensitive teeth because they have had some gum recession and some of the root surface is exposed.  if OTC whiteners get on the root surface, that would be very sensitive.  but carbamide peroxide can be placed more carefully to avoid these areas.

if your teeth are just sensitive through the enamel, then carbamide peroxide will be cause more sensitivity than OTC whiteners.  everyone experiences some amount of sensitivity from whitening, thats normal.  but sensitivity isnt a sign of damage occuring.  my point is, if you think you can handle the sensitivity, then go for it.  but if you would rather not go through that, then dont.  it will probably be around twice as bad as the OTC sensitivity."

wow what does it smell like??

"It is a little misleading the news reports.  For the most part, a large group wants universal health care.  We don't have that.

They show tales of people going bankrupt and people dying in the streets.  Blah, blah.

That doesn't happen for the most part.  A lot of people do have health insurance.  Either through their employer or paid on their own.  Those that don't have health insurance do go to various health care providers, hospitals, emergency care centers.  Depending on the environment those providers will work out a deal with the patient if they can't pay.  If they can't pay then they hand it over to collection agencies to collect.

A lot of people get sick and can't pay or don't want to pay for their health care bill, so they go into bankruptcy.  These are rare cases.

For the most part, people have access to health care and only pay several hundred or a thousand annually. 

End of term of care (care for older people), usually you can get through your employer or medicare.


And then on top of that, the health care in America is pretty advanced.  We have access to top robotics and top doctors and everything else.

Healthcare in the US is expensive, for pretty much everyone.  The health care insurance takes a big chunk of the cost if you are really sick.  If you are really sick and don't have health insurance, see above.

And then on top of that, I don't know if those reports take into account, water safety, food safety.  But America  tries to protect people through basic regulations.  You can't poison the water system and have regulators that try to watch out for that."

"If anything the previous entry is listed too high. When the same game was effectively listed twice I'd just keep whichever one was highest on the list, but this time I took the time to blend the votes and ratings."
"There are some really good fakes out there if you look hard enough, most people just don't want to spend stupid amounts of money for a $20-quality pair of sunglasses"

"I own Blue Noir EdT, but Narciso Rodriguez never misses. I'm sure they all smell good.

Yeah, Sillage is a 2013 batch which was fruiter and citrussy."
Is it slim?
"I'm surprised this wasn't the top. The guy has videos on such a wide range of topics.

A close second is CGP Grey.

Edit: corrected to CGP Grey.  Thanks u/idot-man"
"Whipped cream dispenser and some no2 cartridges.

For just $40, I can infuse anything. Sparkling green tea ramen? Done. Fluffy chocolate? Done. Tea infused bourbon? Hell yeah.

Also, it's fun to breath laughing gas."
"Note: I'm assuming that when you say ""mom"" here, you're not actually talking about YOUR mother, you're talking about your child's mother. I also assume that you are in a relationship with or married to her. If my assumptions are incorrect, throw this away.

Stocking Stuffers:

* High end lip balms. The sweet/minty kind she loves.
* Lotion infused socks.
* A cheap paperback book for her to sit and read.
* An orange or clementine (tradition, yo)
* Some candy if she's into such things.
* 
If the kids are little, and she'll see the mirth in the idea, a pair of stockings to go into her stocking. Something small and sexy so she knows she still lights your fire.

BOOM. Stocking. Done. Right.

From there, it's all a matter of budget. I like a smattering of things. Skip the jewelry. She'll love it, but if you've got wee ones, she'll avoid wearing it so that it doesn't get broken. Avoid practical gifts. I know, I know, that new vacuum she's been hinting about sounds awesome. Save it for a ""new years"" gift to the family. You ""bought it on an after-christmas-sale for a song."" Seriously, avoid stuff that is for the household.

* That said, Coffee/Tea/etc. If you've got room, and the kids are old enough, take them to a 'paint your own ceramic' place. Put a year on it. Bonus points for making one every year. If the child is entirely too little, get their hand wet with paint, and put a hand print on the mug. Fill the mug up with biscotti or similar breakfast cookie type things.

* A new robe. One that doesn't have stains on it from kids spitting up. The super soft and fuzzy kind. Bonus if you include lounge pajamas that go with it. 

* If you live close enough, and it's in the budget, consider a membership to a massage place. It'll give her one massage a month for an entire year. Although, that is a ~$600 investment, so might be out of the budget. However, you tend to pay monthly, and $50/mo might be very doable. 

* A TV series on DVD/BluRay. Something she can do a watching marathon on when the kid is sleeping/at school/etc.
* Gift cert for a pedicure. Extra-credit if you get two, so she can take a friend. 
* A bath set, water proof book, and a bottle of champagne, complete with a chilling bucket. Note that this only works if you've got a bath tub. Note that water proof books tend to end up in either meditation or erotica categories(Not an issue at my house). Alternately consider a water-resistant case for her tablet or phone."
Auto harp for sure.  Just push a button and strum.  Also bass guitar is super easy to learn.
"I get Mint delivered at home and read The Hindu online. DNA seems decent, will get it delivered from next month as well.  Have online access to WSJ, NYT & FT, so I have enough news to read for one day. 

Used to read The Hindu from the last page to the first (sports first!) since childhood but no edition in Mumbai where I live now. 

I also get TOI from time to time if I need paper to keep the dust off my grocery shelves :-)"
"I've had Tmobile for like 12 years, they've always done right by me. Strangely, I get spotty service around my house (so I use wi-fi, That's not an issue), but have always had good reception when I go out, even at different areas in the state and when I traveled to Florida."
"Harmonicas are easy to get the basics of (pick a key, pick a hole, breathe) but their limited nature makes playing more complicated stuff much harder. You can play 3 octaves fully chromatically on a diatonic harmonica if you master bends and overblows. Hole 3 alone has 6 notes available.

Sure, chromatic harmonicas exist specifically for this reason, but people enjoy the sound of diatonic harps too much to make the switch."
Ahh Hoka’s. I love Hoka’s! I’ve got ahari 2. And nike zoomfly for my tempo runs.
We’ll be in the St. Pete area. I am traveling with my mom who fortunately has T-Mobile.
"The Red Wolf Conspiracy by Robert Reddick is an awesome series that just doesn't get enough love IMO.  The author just did an AMA on this subreddit about his new series if you want to get a feel for him.  This series has it all and is really unique and well written.   The main plot follows a group on a large ship which travels to new locations, and so much goes on.  And yes there is a magical object at the heart of the story."
