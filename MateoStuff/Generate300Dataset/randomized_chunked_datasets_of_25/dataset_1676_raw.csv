"It is normally $600, but only third parties are selling it currently. If you're quick, it does occasionally come back (only for a super short time). Like I've done in the past, I always place laptops that vary in price in the price bracket they are typically in."

Yeah it’s like she’s only apologizing because she has to she doesn’t feel one ounce of remorse. If anything she feels misunderstood and doesn’t understand why people are attacking her.

Thanks a lot
"I have a two year old. I've been saying this since I was pregnant and no one has gifted this to me yet- I need a massage, badly. I also haven't had a hair cut in almost two years and I never have the luxury of painting my nails. I guess I'm in need of a ""spa day"". I'm praying."
"I don't know man, to me Floods is more of a ""let's shoot some heroine and see what happens"" kinda song."
