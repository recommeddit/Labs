48181,"I did some painting for a living, as part of apartment maintenance.  We used real wool nap rollers, and they rocked.  For walls, we used a roller that I believe was 18"" wide, with 3/4"" nap.  It would hold a monsterous amount of paint.  We had a paint tray that would hold at least a gallon, maybe two.  It was shaped so that you could pick it up with one hand, and it would rotate and act sort of like a bucket, and allow you to carry all that paint securely that way.  Alas, they stopped making those trays!

To paint raised-panel doors, we used a roller that was 9"" or maybe 12"", that had 1.5"" nap.  Seriously.  One and a half inches.  Flap-flop-splat, except that it didn't send any paint splattering around, it delivered it to the door, nicely reaching right down into those ""raised panel"" recesses.  Then I'd go over it with a brush.  I could paint a full door in a couple of minutes, all nicely brushed in.",best color to paint with
