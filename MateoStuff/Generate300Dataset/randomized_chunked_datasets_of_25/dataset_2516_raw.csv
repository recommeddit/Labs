"People with ""acquired taste"" love to say how shit the ending was and how obvious it was from the start. It's one of those anime that ""critics"" love to criticize"
"So as I mentioned earlier, the amount of original Xbox games supported on the 360 is [roughly a little over half, several with issues but vastly playable, and requires an emulation profile to be downloaded or otherwise loaded onto an HDD before the game can be played](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360).  The statistic is at the top of the article, which also lists all titles with support as well as their issues."
"I almost felt the opposite.  I loved the Witcher 3, but I think I enjoyed the World created by Horizon more.  The seemless transition from one half of the game to the other in Horizon felt really good.  In the Witcher 3, everything seemed open at first, but then you realize how it is all cut up into zones.  Then you see how much of the world that is there is just window dressings (buildings you can't enter, NPCs you can't talk to, etc.)  I felt more engaged in the smaller world of Horizon than the larger one of the Witcher."
"I applaud you. I tend to always go overboard with cases as well, trying out each one and narrowing them down to my top 3. I’m still deciding on what case for my iPhone 11 Pro midnight green"
"He kinda came almost out of nowhere last year. He had a very good rookie season, a sophomore slump, and then jumped up to being one of the best safeties in the league.

Hoping our own Juan Thornhill can do the same this season."

"I find Gin and sugar free tonic to have a good low in calorie/ taste balance. Throw some cucumber and fresh pepper in and you have yourself a good drink.

Unfortunately, I find that I'm signifigantly more likely to drink too much when I drink spirits as opposed to beer. The other + side is that you don't have to piss as much.

As far as your workout goes any alcohol in excess is going to hurt you. Why don't you save the piss ups for after big gym sessions?"

"I love mine! Only problem is I find they get messed up. I had one on my 6 and I kind of just impulse bought one for my 8 because I hate thick cases like the otterbox that was given to me wit the phone, if this one is like my old one I might buy a nomad one when I upgrade. But regardless they offer decent protection with nice clean looks and feel awesome in the hand"
How is germany so low??

My home state (Missouri)'s best park by far is Silver Dollar City.
This is all based on money...what about job satisfaction and happiness?
Sounds like a really great plan. I couldn't think of more applicable courses for data science aside from a statistics course on data analysis

"The bags are pretty tough, but not tough enough if you're hiking from Mexico to Canada, but Evernew bladders do better. They're pretty cheap though, and they've improved since the first generation.  One thing I really love about Sawyer is that the threads are the same as a soda bottle, which meant on one trip in the desert I was able to add capacity for free by recycling a bottle."

Hey I played dark souls 3 and remaster by the time I finished the remaster I was exhausted with dark souls ... now iam in between the fence to try dark souls 2 ... any suggestions ?
"Ah, the popular cologne in High School."
"I eat chopped vegetables and fruit for breakfast.  Seriously.  I cut or peel celery, carrots, apples, oranges, pears, bell peppers, etc, on the weekend, and package them in Tupperware by flavor profile.  Tupperware sits on my passenger seat during my hour commute, and I eat.  Sometimes I supplement with a hard boiled eat and string cheese.  Simple, fast, healthy.

Note:  precut bell pepper, and orange wedges, only last 2-3 days in Tupperware, so plan accordingly."
"First off, You’re using speed as a point for why you prefer Sileo.

Second, you have your opinion, and I have mine

Third, the way BigBoss is depicted in Sileo blocks their ads, which is a huge revenue loss for them since so many people are moving to Sileo"
"Best: Coffee Crisp. I weep for the states for they know not of its deliciousness.

Worst: Those black and orange taffy *things*. Wtf is this shit and why does it taste like a tire."
"It's a mental commitment--took me about six-seven weeks with careful reading--but GR is hands down the most sublime, awesome, and impactful work of art/media I have engaged with. 

The reputation of being impossible is an overstatement: if you like WWII history, proto-cyberpunk (as Gibson declared it), occult magick, mad scientists, military industrial complex commentary, crazed nazis, telepaths, spies, mediums, hard science, paranoia, sixties counter culture, historical movements, mysticism, looney toons, philosophy, myth, Death, and so much more, then it's literally one of the coolest fucking artistic achievements in modern history and should keep you fully engaged.

I obsessed and still obsess over that book. r/thomaspynchon helped a lot as well. Pynchon really makes a fanboy out of you if you aren't coming from the literary side of things but rather the Philip K Dick etc world."
"USB-C isn't ""Made for iPhone"", it's ""made for standards compliant"". A correctly made USB-PD cable and charger will work fine with an iPhone, an Android, a MacBook, or pretty much anything but a Surface or an HP Spectre."
