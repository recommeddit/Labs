Sensodyne. Toothpaste for sensitive ~~teeth~~ little bitches.
I probably would be able to use all of those items! Iâ€™m not picky lol
Or simply use Sci-hub.
I simply googled online bs management information systems
"Daily mail is specifically targeted toward over 50s and the only paper to be angled towards a women demographic. Hence xenophobia and very bitchy articles about other women.   I would say the Independent supposed to be the most neutrally respected paper, surprisingly the free newspaper the Metro is free of any political leanings due to its advertising base. Have to disagree with the Guardian as being free of bias, that newspaper is to the left to what the tabloids are for the right, written for teachers and retired public servants."
"I don't see ""The Mote in God's Eye"" called out - excellent world-building and story telling."
"This is some of the stupidest shit I've seen in awhile. It's not even about where Allen/Diggs are ranked (which I don't agree with), but I feel like the people who created this steaming pile of ass don't even watch football."
That cLOUDDEAD album is a classic. You fuck with Reaching Quiet or Hymie's Basement at all?
"Annihilation (not the other two though)

Under the Skin

"Thanks! I think my main decision now is whether to go high rise (San Miguel and San Nicholas) or low rise (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and Anacapa). So stoked!"
Oh god.  My father had one of those dog shit drawings I made in school *framed and hanging in his bedroom* because I made it for him.  He won't take it down.

Malaguena by Stan Kenton
"I love the book because he's putting the new society on Earth, where I could believe it a little more.  In fact, in parts it reads more like an adventure from a strange land than science fiction.  But I do believe Antarctica came after the Mars Trilogy.

One other overreaching theme I first noticed in this book was his ideal woman type - tall, strong, athletic, independent in actions.  I've seen those also in his later books (don't know yet whether Freya in Aurora falls into this category; I'm only about a third through the book), but KSR was on top of his game in writing about such a woman.  In Science in the Capital (individual books; didn't read the shorter collection) he was just swooning over softball players, without much subtlety."
Colgate
I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that I thought Kony 2012 was some sort of joke or failed presidential campaign because of the name
"I started to use it some months ago.
Really nice!"
To this day it's my favorite album of all time
">  to use *my own paper*

Tell me about it! Not to mention, I had to pay for color figures for some of my papers \*and\* ask them permission to include the papers in my thesis."

I'm sure strontal agrees he's a Tesla fan.
That makes absolutely no sense. Who thought of that?
How do I convince my coworker with bronchitis to stay home instead of coughing every 30 seconds for two and a half weeks?
