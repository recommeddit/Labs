The stock is often brand new equipment and supplies donated by local builders or leftover from home builds, and lots of random donated furniture and housewares. Unpredictable but you can find some real gems, the last pleasant thrifting experience.",best home improvement store
64993,"For Mexican food also check out El Sitio and Super Cucas. Have to agree that La Super Rica and Lily's Tacos are both some of the best Mexican restaurants in town. There's always Los Arroyos and Los Agaves, but in my opinion those are a bit too popular and packed, and frankly not as authentic and awesome at the other places.

Sorry there isn't as much of a restaurant selection as you'd hope for, but as you get to know Santa Barbara better you'll find some awesome places that you'll love. Welcome to Santa Barbara!",best places to eat in Santa Barbara
56453,"I got an Odyssey G7 32' last week. Great Monitor and after the last Windows 10 Update, HDR becomes Viable. I returned it 2 days later though.   
I'm a fan of a bit of Curve, 1800R is fine, even 1500R, but man, that 1000R Curve, everything looked distorted to me, Plus I got a bit of Nausea sometimes.  
Other people have got used to it though and they don't mind it anymore.  


Samsung will release Flat Versions of G7 in the Q2 of 2021, so if you want to wait like me, it's worth it, even though I'm not a fan of totally Flat Monitors, especially on VA Panels.

AW2721D, I'm thinking about it, but it has IPS Glow Issues plus Low Contrast compared to VA Panels, so I'm sceptical since I always game in total dark or low ambient light.",best desktop monitor
