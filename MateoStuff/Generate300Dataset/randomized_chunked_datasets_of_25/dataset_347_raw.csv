Fast and Furious is so bad I can't even take my friends on it as a joke. Ugh.
And lose half their readers?
I started to watch Don't F*ck with Cats but as an animal lover I just couldn't.
Yes perfect
NordVPN got good speeds but not being able to seed with them witch sucks....
"Yeah, it's on my must watch film list! And yes, I'm sad it got spoiled for me but I'm pretty sure I will enjoy it the same way! :)"
"Hey wait a minute, they stole your username for their company!"
"So what you're saying is it hurts so good? Kinky. 

(I'm just teasing, it's just... I cant NOT imagine the stinging feeling :P)"
"I mostly stopped shopping at HD about 20 years ago.

Wife and I needed an over-the-range microwave. Went into HD, looked at all the displays, and found one we liked for like $225. Told the clerk we would take that one and he says it has to be ordered. I said fine, we weren't in a hurry. That is when he tells us there is a $75 delivery charge. I said that shipping to the store was fine, but he said the charge would be the same either way.

So, frustrated and not willing to pay an extra 33%... we ask which ones don't have to be shipped. He walks off to his terminal and looks around for 20 minutes only to come back and tell us that all of them do. 

So despite having an entire bank of displays, they don't have a single one they can sell without a $75 extra charge. We complained to the mgr to no avail and ended by telling them to fuck off.

We drove across the street to Lowes, picked one out. Clerk pulled it for us and loaded it right into our car.

I know it won't break them, but I would guess that $75 has cost them about $60k in the years since then (we do a lot of house work)."

"I did write one a while back specifically about classics that have stayed in my collection.

"I was browsing the comments to find your comment, because Arlington Road was the first movie I watched because of this post. I just wanted to tell you that in my opinion it was like Secret Window for a weird reason. Both had interesting plots, I was sitting on the edge of my seat all the time UNTIL the twist happened. Both had really bad twist in my opinion. But still, it was so much better than Secret Window. At least I had a 'holy fuck' moment when he found it the bomb was in his car. And the other 95% of the movie was one of the most interesting stories I've ever seen. Too bad the twist kind of ruined it. It could've been a 9/10, but the twist had no build-up at all, even if I know how the bomb got into his car, so it's a solid 7/10! Thank you for the suggestion, I really enjoyed it! :)"
"Thanks, friend. I just bought me a pair."
Bale played a good match so fifa updated the rankings
"I grabbed the HP Omen 27i last month, it’s $399 rn ($100 off). Nano IPS. Released just a few weeks ago, it’s amazing but not curved. Also has rgb backlight"
"Hello again, quick follow-up to /u/mcqueenofthehill's [Street Style Sunglasses Inspo Album](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hc25mk/sunglasses_streetstyle_edition/).  It's fantastic content, and will probably be more useful for most, but as the village idiot, I think we should also have an inspo album for **POWERFUL** Sunglasses.    No weak shit.  No Ray-Bans.  No Warby Parkers.

Some brands that come to mind:

* [Percy Lau](https://www.percylau.com/)
* [Micromega](https://www.micromegaeyewear.com/)
* [Jacques Marie Mage](https://jacquesmariemage.com/)
* [Mykita](https://mykita.com/en)
* [Masahiro Maruyama](https://masahiromaruyama.com/)
* [Rigards](https://www.rigards.com/)
* [Kuboraum](https://www.kuboraum.com/)
* [Rick Owens](https://www.rickowens.eu/en/US/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Sunglasses)
* [Gentle Monster](https://www.gentlemonster.com/)
* [Godsomware](https://www.instagram.com/godsomware/)
* [Retrosuperfuture](https://retrosuperfuture.com/)

This album is just the tip of the iceberg, and if you find anything that you think should be in this album, let me know and I'll add it.  I strongly encourage you to browse through the other offerings of the brands listed above (and others).  Sunglasses can be something that you protect your eyes with, but they can _also_ be really awesome accessories and accent pieces!  Be dope and wear dope shit!"
Evian tastes like dish soap.
My method of execution as well. Its basically a bowl of brown sugar with some oatmeal in there.
How are there no Culture novels by Ian M. Banks on the top list?!
"I guess it’s weird, because amongst rams fans it’s almost always AD"
"I don't it matters at all. If they check, they check to make sure your not a racist/homicidal maniac. 

For reference: a friend of mine just got an offer from Facebook and had never used Facebook before. He created an account only because you need one to send in an application."
"Her Smoke Rose Up Forever -- short story collection, James Tiptree Jr

Always Coming Home -- Ursula Le Guin

The Dispossessed -- Ursula Le Guin

Woman On The Edge Of Time -- Marge Piercy

Broken Earth trilogy -- N K Jemisin (impossible to choose just one novel out of the three)

The Man In The High Castle -- Philip K Dick

Warrior's Apprentice -- Lois McMaster Bujold

Forever War -- Joe Haldeman

Red Mars -- Kim Stanley Robinson

The Steerswoman's Road -- Rosemary Kirstein

But really you could just choose ten books by Ursula Le Guin, including her short story collections, and it'd be a great list."
Go pure electric. Get the newest model Leaf or BMW you can afford. You will love it.
"I think SM7bs sound great. But that depends on the usage, you probably have more technical usage that 7Bs are not built for. I'm actually using an SM57 for my voice before I had an AT 2035. Now the SM57 is permanent on the amp. But is actually doable for voice too. The thing with mics is that most it some work on EQ and leveling."
gotcha... opera is safe to use? no issue about their privacy?
