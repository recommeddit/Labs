Apart from that I also love whole exchange around the development of understanding into vesicle trafficking and in particular Jim Rothman's papers (brilliant experiments, great results, somewhat incorrect conclusions) but probably requires to get into field a bit too much to be of use for this exercise. 

I also love almost anything by [Sean Nee](http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/snee/publications.htm) because he does good science, reports it concisely and clearly and is entirely irreverent (for an amusing, single page, incredibly accessible essay by him (not a paper) check out [the Great Chain of Being](http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/snee/chain.pdf).

Finally, for a wonderful example of scientific squabbling and missing each other's points there is [Trewavas' Green Plants as Intelligent Organisms](http://www.mediafire.com/?8d4p7dygrum1oaf), to which there was [this 33 prominent author backlash](http://blumwald.ucdavis.edu/publications/Alpi%202007.pdf) followed by Trewavas' [reply](http://www.linv.org/images/about_pdf/Trends%202007%20Trewavas.pdf).",best research paper archive
