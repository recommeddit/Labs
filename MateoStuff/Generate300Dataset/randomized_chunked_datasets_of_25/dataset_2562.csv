53677,best medicine for a cold,"I personally also avoid cold medicine and try to just rest and take it easy instead BUT not all people feel the same way with a cold or have a choice to rest or have the same duration of a cold. Being congested is annoying to me, but if you're asthmatic it might be pretty hazardous.

Basically you don't know what other people are dealing with and if decongestants make them feel better then where is the harm? Treating an illness doesn't make you a weaker person."

34474,best NFL player,"Are greatest and best synonymous for this question? For me, winning is part of greatness, but it doesn't necessarily make you the best. Brady is pretty unarguably greater than Peyton imo, but I still believe Peyton is/was better.

There is no such thing as a Best Football Player every I don't think, but Greatest could be any of, Brady, Montana, Jerry, and then my pick, Otto Graham."

32397,best hotel to live in,"Aah, I have a few from my 20s. 

There was a natural disaster which required staff to stay on site with a floor to themselves. Bathtubs were filled with ice and booze and managers were found wandering backhalls in their undies. 

Michelin chef and F&B manager caught on camera cheating on their partners in a stairwell. 

Leaders of [redacted] in town for global governmental meetings, eating chicken in the lobby and throwing the bones on the floor. 

My friend was the GM of one of one of the most famous high-end hotels in America, and shared a story about a resident of their penthouses having a mental breakdown, destroying everything, ripping the sink off the wall, and sprinting down the hallway naked and getting tackled by security. His neighbors include CEOs of Fortune 50s. 

The reasons the prices are so high isn't the rent, we owned the building. Bought it from a failed casino owner turned political leader for pennies. The prices were influenced first by extremely high payroll, then quality, then profit.

Edit:
Also, people die in hotels all the time. Age, stress, whatever. It's not uncommon to get calls from concerned spouses, do a wellness check, and oof. They're rolled out the back during quiet hours. 

There's a decent amount of theft internally, but the workers all protect and cover for each other, and turn on managers that catch them.

These major established properties, the staff is pretty akin to the Mafia. They make things happen. 

Not as much drug use as others mentioned at ours. A lot of the f&b staff was past their 20s."
