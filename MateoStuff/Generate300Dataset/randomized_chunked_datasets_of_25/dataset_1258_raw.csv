"Wow, no Eldritch Horror? It feel like i am the only one who knows about the game. I never see it in groups but its tons of fun."
LOL! Lets not talk about it. Lets just be happy that we are here.
It’s time to learn geography!
This is a good one
+1 for Gino’s. Reasonably priced and always delicious.
"I'm from Minneapolis, and I'd suggest you not come here in the winter. The novelty of the air hurting when you step out will wear out fast and then you'll be bored here in the winter if you expect the likes of London or New York. We don't have world class downhill skiing like the western states, so outdoor activities are pretty much ice skating (Centennial Lake park is wonderful) or cross country skiing. Minneapolis is better in the summer when you can bicycle and the state parks in the northern part of the state (I'd recommend Gooseberry Falls, Split Rock Lighthouse, Interstate, and Scenic) are more accessible. 

For an NFL match, the ultimate would be a Green Bay Packers home game  (they're a couple of hundred miles east of Minneapolis and north of Chicago) against one of their division rivals- Minnesota, Chicago, and Detroit. 

For the south, I'm sure you've thought about Florida, and I'd much prefer that to Dallas. Another idea would be North Carolina. Southern hospitality and cooking and you have the beaches on the Outer banks as well as Biltmore estate and the mountains. 

I'd agree with skipping LA and LV. Nothing wrong with LA, but San Francisco and if possible Yosemite and Redwood Parks, are better for a first time to California. Las Vegas has it's own culture of decadence that's not typical of the US."
"I've never found a perfume I could wear. Everything turns gross on my skin. I've never tried any of these, though, so maybe I just need a higher quality of perfume! Lots of great suggestions to try."
Nearly all bottled water in the US goes through RO. It doesn't distill the water.
"I assume its based on quality, not accessibility."

Mint Oreo is the bomb.

"If you use it to its full potential, the Stream Deck is an amazingly powerful tool. It can be used for a whole slew of things, but here's an example of my basic stream workflow:

Press a button that turns on my lights, boots OBS, boots Chatty (IRC-based Twitch chat program), and opens the Twitch creator dashboard. I used to have this also open Twitter, but have kinda moved away from that platform for no good reason.

Here I spend some time getting the game running, setting a title, that sort of thing.

Press a button to enable my setting up scene and toggle a few sources. I actually have one scene handle start/end/brb screens, I just have all the elements for them in layers that the Stream Deck turns on and off based on which version I'm requesting. It then goes live and starts playing my intro media (music, in my case).

Do the normal starting stuff - ensure I have transcoding, the stream is stable, get a drink...

Press a button, and it goes to my normal gameplay scene and unmutes my mic audio source. I have a bunch of buttons that are useful here - I can go directly into a 16:9 gameplay scene, a 4:3 scene, a full-screen camera chatting scene, BRB, etc. I also have a button that toggles the camera I'm showing on all of the above scenes at once, so I don't have to think about which one I'm on currently.

Then, when I'm done, hit a button, and it goes to a version of the chatting scene with my socials so I can plug them right at the end, yadda yadda, and a final 'end stream' button that goes to an ending scene, plonks some links into chat, mutes my mic, turns off my lights, and plays music again.

All of the above could also be achieved by manually toggling scenes and sources in OBS, or with a ton of remembered hot keys, or a smaller number of hot keys that pipe into AutoHotKey. It is, arguably, a device of convenience. The Stream Deck just makes doing it a lot easier, it's simpler to iterate with, and I've never had to alt-tab to use the Stream Deck. (I've found that some games when played fullscreen don't let inputs escape their little sandbox.)

I just added a Stream Deck XL to my setup, and I am planning to add some effects. One idea is to fade to greyscale, play 'hello darkness my old friend', and then revert back to normal after a timer. Again, AutoHotKey could do this, or I could have a dedicated button that does it all for me and will work without alt-tabbing."

"Tom Vasel and Rahdo did a fantastic job explaining this in their ""Top 10 Games of the Decade."" Wingspan is a non-gateway game marketed as a gateway game and it is brilliantly done."
I'd probably be a little upset if someone walked up to me while I was enjoying a meal and asked me to sign something.

Not true. There are CSU's that grant PhD's. CSU's are teaching institutions...UC's are research institutions.

"This only works if you catch the symptoms right away.  Achey, sore neck, sniffles, chills.

1.  Stop whatever you are doing and go home.
2.  Slice up some fresh ginger and steep in hot water (3 or 4 quarter sized pieces should be fine)
3.  Draw a (as hot as you can stand) bath and get in, drink tea
4.  Get in bed under heavy and or thick blankets.
5.  Sleep and sweat

Why it works:  Core temperature has an effect on viral replication rate.  If you get your core temp up just 1 degree C you can slow down the speed at which the viruses are replicating.  Ginger warms you up, the bath warms you up and the heavy blankets keep you warm.  Your immune system works better in stage 3 and 4 sleep so an hour or two napping gives your body a better shot at fighting off whatever has got you.  

If your symptoms are mild when you do this the chances are good you will wake up feeling much better.  You should still continue to hydrate and rest.  If you are stuck somewhere and you can't do this and your symptoms worsen, you can still try it but it won't be as likely to produce the same ""magic"".

If you don't have ginger, hot water, hot and sour soup, miso soup, tea... just something warming will do fine."
