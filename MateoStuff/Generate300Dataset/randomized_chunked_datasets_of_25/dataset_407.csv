9634,"Another plus for San Miguel. It's one of the older dorms but it's obviously the most central out of all of them, the closest to Ortega dining commons (best lunch if you don't like eating pizza everyday), and the floor size is perfect. With ~25 per floor you have just enough people that it's never empty but not so many that major cliques form. I was friends with everyone on the floor and with most of the girls on the floor above. They were all close too, because of the 25 per floor reason, so it was a neat set up. That being said, I had plenty of fun in Santa Cruz and FT as well, I just think San Miguel had the most pros going for it.

My biggest recommendation would be against manzanita or Santa Rosa.",best dorm hall at UCSB
