7549,best laptop for general use,"I would prefer a light weight one with quite good battery life. So i guess those are important, i would be glad having something under 2kg, and atleast 10-12hours of battery life."

371,best terminal file manager reddit,"I'm using ranger at the moment because I wanted something that was entirely keyboard based. I'm not sure how I feel about yet, but that's heavily related to the fact that I don't know all the hotkeys yet :P

17700,best iOS game,I hate that I love it... I don't spend any money on it but I play Gardenscapes before bed maybe twice a week or more.

6169,best Netflix documentary,Icarus started off one way and then took a HARD LEFT TURN
24037,best anime,"I like your list because it has something for everyone in it. Also you listed 5 of my favourite anime shows I've seen, especially happy to see Eureka Seven. Haven't seen Steins;Gate yet but it's something I've been meaning to get around to."
71947,best movies with a cool twist,"People forget the now well-known (so I am probably not spoiling it for anyone) shower scene in Psycho was a massive twist when the movie first came out.  It's a twist then that really made the movie a hit, but has little affect on us now because everyone knows its going to happen before they see the movie."
23270,best car racing video game,I wish sim games let you customize stuff.  Stock cars are boring.

34964,best NFL player,"I was very surprised he was so low. I can see how Dbuck was ranked higher by some, but Chris Jones is a menace, was my 2 after AD and I stand by it"
9634,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Another plus for San Miguel. It's one of the older dorms but it's obviously the most central out of all of them, the closest to Ortega dining commons (best lunch if you don't like eating pizza everyday), and the floor size is perfect. With ~25 per floor you have just enough people that it's never empty but not so many that major cliques form. I was friends with everyone on the floor and with most of the girls on the floor above. They were all close too, because of the 25 per floor reason, so it was a neat set up. That being said, I had plenty of fun in Santa Cruz and FT as well, I just think San Miguel had the most pros going for it.

My biggest recommendation would be against manzanita or Santa Rosa."
57401,best water brand,"Nestlé - Pure Life

I read the back and it’s literally water from our local public water supply. After that I decided nestle is bullshit. Their borrowing from our public water supply and selling it back to us at a mark up"
