(Yes, I realize that I am, in fact, chopped liver)."

22345,best celebrity,"From a lot of interviews, Armstrong stated that if he knew what being “the first man on the moon” meant, he wouldn’t have done it. Buzz Aldrin’s got a bit of an ego and *absolutely* would have done it.

Which is why NASA made sure Neil went first."
67839,best science fiction novel,"Am currently reading Cryptonomicon and am through more than 2/3 of the book and I can't see why it is classified as science fiction. 

Also it is an ok book but it doesn't come near Snow Crash and that is just my opinion."
26802,best board games,I guess that’s true…. Still love me some cities and knights though.
44477,best items under $100,Yeah maybe I’m old school but the grandma pill box works haha
31979,best hotel to live in,"Ah, never stayed in a Ritz so I wasn't familiar."
22346,best celebrity,"I’ve read this as well.

Buzz was a bit of an egomaniac, not who they wanted with that distinction. But brilliant, quick thinker and always cool under pressure.

Armstrong wasn’t their first choice (he became the choice after the Apollo I fire), but he was the better person for the task.

Likewise Collins wasn’t a random pick either. He was also considered ideal for that role and this mission. Totally underrated part of the team. He’s a brilliant speaker/writer."
9210,best toothpaste,"Brushing is actually very important for the gums. So you might have clean teeth, but your gums will be fucked. The Gingivitis is strong in this one"
8936,best toothpaste,"Actually, enamel is the outer coating of the tooth (the white part). Why our dentist here says to watch out for abrasive toothpastes (and I'm sure he/she will agree when I say don't brush too hard) is that the enamel wears off and then the dentin shows which is yellow in color. 
The fluoride is used to protect from something called Dental Carries, which is basically bacteria in your teeth that digest sugar (from soda to bread) and produce an acid byproduct that erodes through the enamel, past the dentin, and to the sensitive nerve tissue (hence toothaches/cavities).

32349,best hotel to live in,"I wrote travel guides to places in the Middle East (Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, etc) and have stayed in lots of five star hotels around the world for work. 

THe whole five-star system is murky from the start.

The manager at a top-class London hotel told me that the hotel grading system in general is “utter nonsense”. The problem, he said, is that the list of criteria to reach each of the star ratings is little more than a tick sheet, albeit with around 500 factors to consider. For example, one criterion for being considered five-star is fresh flowers being present in guest rooms, but there’s a huge difference between a big ornate display of orchids and a bunch of daffodils. The presence of either would technically tick the box and in theory you could fulfill all the required five-star criteria yet be hugely inferior to the hotel next door that offers all the same things but at a much higher quality and standard.

The Forbes Travel Guide gave just six London hotels a five-star rating (including the one my insider works at) but that means that fantastic hotels like The Ritz, The Langham, The Berkeley, and Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park are “only” four star. Are they really 20 percent inferior to the five-star-rated Al Bustan Rotana in Garhoud in Dubai which is basically a business hotel near the airport?

It’s also difficult to maintain a consistent roll-call of criteria, as modern demands change. For example, Wi-Fi in the room is a relatively recent expectation and what we expect as standard has changed over the years, so what constitutes luxury now has altered accordingly. When Savoy Hotel in London opened 1889 it was boasting about features such as electric lifts, “speaking tubes” to link each floor, and fully plumbed bathrooms.

Now though, in the era of Internet, crowd sourcing is often the most reliable way to judge somewhere. When hundreds of people on sites like TripAdvisor say a place is overpriced and terrible then it doesn’t matter what the official book says. And if a one-star hotel gets nothing but praise from 90 percent of the people commenting? There’s your consensus of rating right there."

33499,best electric car,"How much is insurance for 2 cars? Lots of car enthusiast cars are the ones you can't just have without a second car. You can have a Rav4 as your sole vehicle since it's large enough to carry people and it can handle snow. If you have a miata unless you are in the south you can't just have that one car. So now you need a second. And honestly insurance is more expensive then the cars in the long run. The miata to buy now is like 300 per month for 3 years. While the insurance is 200 per month for forever.  AND you still need to buy that Crosstrek. 

So you spending 50k no matter what. 

I know this because IM CURRENTLY IN THIS SITUATION. I make decent but ANY good enthusiast car outside of like 2 (the WRX and the golf R) are rear wheel and I live in the North.

When no one can buy a house and relarionships percentage is at a low and so everyone is living by themselves you don't have the optics to buy a enthusiast car. They are fun but not practical and unless wages start to go back and houses get cheap they won't be viable choices for people"
