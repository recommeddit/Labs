I did it out of spite... suck it.
Wasn't there also a NFL Network 100 greatest players list in 2020?
I haven’t had any problems. Maybe a thick glass screen protector but the thin films shouldn’t effect the touch
They were complicit in it because they were both looking for affection and attention from the guy. Fucked up family altogether

Jerky is very under-rated as a gift
I feel the same about Adidas moves for guys. It's the cheapest cologne I've bought and have received by far the most compliments on it
I don't need your nancy-pancy push cart! I killed 50 men!
"When people associate frags with season, it generally just is a way of references temperature ranges. So frags that do well in cold weather are more F/W and vice versa."
Love the Pegasus. It's a no-nonsense shoe.
"Management information systems. All the knowledge of business, but with all the tech knowledge too."
"I think she just means that most women's clothing has either tiny itty bitty pockets that could maybe fit a stick of gum or no pockets, so we either go without, sew in pockets or buy guy's clothing."
We produce left arm spinners ( usually good for one year)  and crowd at home games that is about it. Main thing is we suck. So watch our games to laugh at us at sucking so bad. :D
"Okay this is to everyone who mentioned Emerald. 

So if I understand correctly Emerald is a better version of Ruby and Sapphire or something alone the line? Then what about Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are they better than Emerald?"
"I didn't read the book, so I did not know the writing was awful. Your comment reads that the acting is strengthened by other elements. From your reply I see that what you meant to say is that the show is strengthened by other elements."
It was a world-wide effort. He did come up with the shotgun approach tho that sped things up immensely.
The only problem with an SE2 is that the screen is almost an 1 inch smaller than an 7 plus. That alone is holding me back from trading in my iPhone 7 Plus for an SE2.
I still use request :(
I think that was the appeal. It was so bad it was good.
Mexico sounds like it would satisfy most of your requirements. Cabo maybe?
"GT2. Viper. Laguna Seca for the professional licence. Beat 1.22.00

Over 300 attempts. 

When I finally beat it, I carefully saved the game, copied the save file onto another memory socket, then danced around the living room for 20 minutes. Top of the world ma! Top of the world. 

I was 29"

"The autoharp. It has push buttons for the chords and there are different strumming patterns/rhythms you can learn and it sounds lovely. Extremely portable and it is sturdy as well. Buy ""Beginning Autoharp Instruction Book"" by Bonnie Phipps on amazon and it will get you playing right away. I know this because I did all of this myself. Perfect for celtic and folk as well. There is also a late 60s band that uses autoharp and it sounds really cool :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_JJJL4Dm-o"
"Your estimated range daily is pretty small. Idk what your weather is like, but you could consider a spark ev, Fiat 500e, etc. They're often sub $10k (got my 2013 500e for $6.5k at 22k miles). They'll charge off a standard 110v outlet as long as it's at least 15A (most are). I've never ran mine so low that it didn't have enough charge to cover my next day. However, a full charge is around 23 hours. I think the 2017 leaf has 150 mile range and would be cheaper than a bolt."
