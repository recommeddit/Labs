Poo is simply retarded.
I fucking love this post.
"Being fair, instead of a kid feuding with bullies, its just a more arrogant  kid fueding with adults.  Pretty much the same.  Amazing stories both, but one isn't less juvenile than the other.  

I think the unique draw that universe has, particularly to kids reading the books, is that OSC gives kids the same respect for their mental capacity and volition that most other adults unfairly reserve until kids are teenagers or even adults."
"I switched to Tom's a few years ago and really like the difference. None of that aftertaste, and I brush longer."
"Soon^^TM

Edit: joking aside, they're currently running a server rest in Brazil and another country on Android. Wild Rift devs posted a pretty good vid on YouTube if you have the time to check it out. I'm pumped for it as I just got into MLBB and been enjoying learning about LOL and other MOBA lane battlers."
"Without being political or anything, one man can't change anything, even in ten years.  


The USA will never be like this, not in a decade at least."
"In my opinion, the list is embarrassingly bad."
"I know that feeling, my mom moved to the US when she was 18.  She has this favorite candy bar from Venezuela that you can't get anywhere here in the state's.  One Christmas o managed to find an importer who would get me a box of the candy bars.  She started to ball her eyes out when she opened the gift. My brother's just looked at me like ""thanks a lot asshole."" She got some cool gifts that year but getting a bit of her childhood in yummy wafer form killed it. Now I can never match up to that gift.

Tldr: candy bars for Xmas  brought back childhood memories, ruined future gifts forever."
Issey Miyaki is my absolute favourite. It's like heaven in a bottle.

"Fave is Kim, I’ve really enjoyed watching her grow as a person over the years and develop into better person, and least fave is kourt. 

Don’t get me wrong she’s had some funny moments and memorable quotes, but I don’t like her personality, even during the early seasons with the Scott drama, whilst I’m not backing Scott, I couldn’t route for her, as I felt she was very toxic too, and her pregnancies were clearly not what Scott wanted and she didn’t care. He was in no position, mentally or otherwise, to have another kid, and she was like well I want one so oops I’m pregnant, deal with it"
What is the drafting variant?
The difference between him and Nixon could not have been more drastic. Such a tragic loss.

Last year we packed 6 in a 2 queen bed room. 3 in each bed.
I really enjoyed Children of Time. Read it back in May. Getting ready to start Children of Ruin after I finish my current book!
