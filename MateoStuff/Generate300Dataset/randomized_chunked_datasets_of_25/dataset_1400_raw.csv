I don't understand why anyone ever slices avocado for anything. It's so much easier to just mush it up. It's not like it tastes any different. Slices just end up sliding off whatever you put them on.

"Huge HP fan. I don't really admire Snape. His love for Lily was obsessive and creepy. While it was his best redeeming feature, it was also his worst flaw; it caused him to brave and to work for the greater good, but it also caused him to be a bullying wanker to Harry and Neville. As Sirius (rather hypocritically) says: *If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors...*"
"That's true. Actually on that note, what I will say is you also want to be careful doing this. Reason being one day, someone is going the bright idea to move all this code to some internal library and then some other developer is going to have the even brighter idea to integrate file uploads, authentication, session  handling and other various utils similar to external dependencies like fetch or got. The problem is, the code could be crafted by the most artisinal and refined developers in the world but as soon as they leave, that code becomes a legacy system that is critical to everything else. Then you get junior developers or developers that are on a schedule and are solving one niche case patching things here and there but overall to scared to change even a line of code and suddenly the whole thing turns into spaghetti with little to no documentation.

Maybe this is an extreme example but it helps to outsource your problems to external dependencies. Just don't go crazy and start importing every single thing. I had a developer who once tried to import a React Modal and attempt to hack it into submission instead of well, building it from scratch. The only analogy I think of is imagine trying to re-tie a rope that's already tangled mess. Sometimes it's just better to cut the old knot loose and tie a new one."
"Well, kings islands transition to cedar fair has been hugely successful. Multiple amazing installations. Diamond back, banshee, the new orion, the new family stuff, kiddie land rebranding.

Hersheypark also grew leaps and bounds. The crazy pace of additions there is wild. And unique rides, and theming, just keep coming. Both have vaulted into the discussion. 

Not like six flags has distanced themselves, magic mountain not withstanding. The over reach for the smaller parks, and operational issues have closed gap between them and competitors.  

Cedar fairs acquisitions has raised their exposure to more parts of country. Knotts is doing amazing things in a small footprint. 

Its a great time to be a park junkie."
"I currently reside in an Asian country. We don't have potable tap water so we usually rely on water purifiers and bottled water. I'll be moving to North America in a few months and carried out my research on drinking water. The tap water might have traces of microplastics, but storing them in plastic bottles can further increase the concentration of the same.

I saw a CBS Canada documentary sometime back in which they picked popular bottled water brands and ran tests. They found that majority of them consisted varying quantities of micro plastics in them.

Also, the people who prefer de-mineralized water, I'd suggest getting a TDS meter, the device is fairly cheap and it helps detect the Total Distribution of Solids (TDS) in a water source. Having worked in the water purification industry in the past, a TDS concentration of 70-120 is safe for human consumption as water with 0 TDS does not contain the minerals that you should be getting from your drinking water.

The distilled water (0 TDS) is more suited for refilling inverter batteries as it prevents corrosion. Drinking this water can lead to mineral deficiencies which can lead to various ailments. 

To summarize, micro plastics are everywhere, we can try to reduce our exposure as much as possible for better health."

"Get Colgate Prevident 5000, it's prescription only, I get from my dentist. It's much higher in fluoride than store-bought for added tooth decay protection, and it helps with tooth sensitivity too.

I alternate it with any regular store-bought toothpaste..."

"Absolutely has to be Top Gear for the SNES. No fancy car cusomisation, no painting or decorating; you get four cars to choose from. You use the directional pad to steer and hold a button to speed up, and use another one to hit the brakes. Just pure racing: choose a place in the world to race, go around the lap a few times, if you win, you move on.

It's just... it's so clean and minimalistic, and it doesn't have all the extra junk I hate about racing games, like missions for the driver that are not racing."

"Great post. Just a couple things to add:

- Ginger, honey, lemon, salt rinses, and so on may be temporary relievers of sore throats in some people but have limited effect on other symptoms and will not reduce the length of your cold. Chomping down on a ginger root or drinking hot lemon juice with honey will not help you get better faster but it may make some symptoms more bearable in the short term. 
- Homoeopathic remedies contain absolutely no active ingredients, are primarily water, and have no scientific backing whatsoever. Ayurvedic medicine is also bullshit.
- The cold is not caused by cold weather or being cold. The cold is however more prevalent during the winter when large groups tend to spend more time in tight quarters indoors. 
-  “Feed a cold, starve a fever” has very limited scientific backing with only a handful of small scale studies. Medical professionals recommend with either condition that you shouldn't over consume, but if you’re hungry you should eat.
- There is no cure."
"Why do you like Roar so much? Serious question, not sarcastic. The layout seems good it just seems like it needs a retrack at a minimum."
What did you do? Did you just swing by after breakfast with a $20?
Ugh. My husband was watching Ex-Machina (I was obviously browsing reddit) He fell asleep and I got sucked into the movie. TERRIFYING. The haunting imagery and that soundtrack...I was scared even though he was in the room. Great movie.

Filza? Is there a youtube video for this?
