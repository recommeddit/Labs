61355,Best RPG game on PS4,"I actually dont agree with the vast majority of that review funny enough. I liked dos 1 ee a lot, dos2 not as much but that may have been because i played it only a few months after dos1. Theyre good games but in the second, I was relying on cheese tactics wayyyyy too often just to pull through a fight, and would probably enjoy it a lot more on the lower difficulty options where you dont have to do 15 hours of sidequests for every hour of mainquests just to be properly levelled/geared. Optional side content should be just that, optional, and i hate when games force you into them by level gating the main quests."

42994,best detective show,"Halt and Catch Fire. 

It's basically Mad Men: 80's Computer Company Edition. Soooooooo good,  slow burn with an amazing cast."
2761,best headphones,"The man o war is awful. I'm also removing the Virtuoso from the list as it very bad but the mic rocks. And it's not worth itm

Wait for the Audeze Penrose."
69529,best major to study in college,"And a lot of them are state schools (land-grant universities, FTW) so the tuition is cheaper."
12929,best gifts for mom,Mom asked for a Keurig. So I'm buying her a Keurig.
7915,best laptop for general use,"Laptops under $500 are tough because performance varies pretty wildly and build quality is also all over the place. 

Here are few you could check out, but obviously sales could bring a better laptop under $500. 

[Acer Aspire 5 - $370 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Display-Graphics-Keyboard-A515-43-R19L/dp/B07RF1XD36/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=acer+aspire+5&qid=1613622138&sr=8-3)

Acer is known for having decent budget laptops. This is probably one of the better ones. It has a good battery and is fairly bright in the screen, but the build quality is suspect. 

[Gateway 15” - Walmart $400](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gateway-15-6-FHD-Ultra-Slim-Notebook-Intel-Core-i5-1035G1-16GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Tuned-THX-Audio-Webcam-HDMI-Fingerprint-Scanner-Cortana-Windows-10-Home-/225790553)

The gateway computers from Walmart are highly rated for being decent cheap options. This one is on sale, down from $700 to $400 and has a nice cpu for that price. The build quality is suspect and there are some quality control issues so you might get unlucky, but if I was going to get a sub-$500 laptop it might be this one. Plus it has cool colors, if your friend cares about that. 

[HP Pavilion 2 in 1 - BestBuy$500](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-pavilion-x360-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-natural-silver/6428667.p?skuId=6428667)

This one is if your friend also wants a tablet. I extremely dislike 2 in 1 laptops, because usually it doesn’t do either function well. But I threw it where for an option."
41183,best instrument to play,At least my autotuned woodchipper sounds better than a normal woodchipper
3808,best college for research,"Well WSJ, includes LAC's, so GWU's actual rank among nat unis is 48, Forbes has it around the same, and it beats out it's ""peers"" to overperform if that makes sense."
55347,best action and adventure novel series,"You're welcome. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The sequel is amazing, as well."
1738,best ice cream flavor,Rum Raisin.
43851,best items under $100,can you school me a bit on this?
32383,best hotel to live in,"I am a subcontractor that works in the It business and the W hotel in Miami beach has seen some shit. 
One day I come in to work and there is a big scramble at the upper floors( that is were the penthouse are)
Seems this kinda known millionaire, had a little too much coke and god knows what else and was destroying the room. 
He was actually throwing furniture out the balcony, ripped everything out of the fridge, might of even thrown a mattress out the balcony.
It was a big deal at the time but they keep it hush with no police involved, a guy that’s paying 9k-13k a night is not going to be arrested. When the team finally got into the room, there was cocaine all over the tables, bottles everywhere, and a couple of high class call girls that were in true fear.
Next day they book the same room to Jennifer Lopez."
25271,best spiderman actor,"For me it will always be like this: Tobey was a great Peter but he didn't catch all the personality of Spiderman, for me he was too serious as a Spiderman. 

Andrew was a great Spiderman more ""funny"" and sarcastic with his enemies but at the same time he was responsible about it.

Tom for me is the worst in any aspect but not because of the actor, he's performances are great, the problem is that the way they're developing his Spiderman is so childish and sometimes his actions doesn't even make sense. 

Personally my all time favorite movies of our friendly neighborhood are Spiderman Into the spider verse, Spiderman 2, The amazing Spiderman and Spiderman."
70140,best major to study in college,"Bull. If you work hard, you can do good as a graphic designer."
39307,best web browser,On Linux Firefox is better then chrome. But I can’t switch to Firefox since one thing is missing. The bookmark bar does not show only in a new tab like chrome. If it only showed the bookmark bar in a new tab I would like it more.
35579,best alcoholic drink,Which is probably what would happen if I wandered into a forest after drinking that
