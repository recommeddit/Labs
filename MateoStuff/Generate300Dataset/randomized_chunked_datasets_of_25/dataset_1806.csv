26727,best board games,"Ha, i had an inkling at my store $40 was the sweet spot for hot sellers, so i am glad my hunch possibly matches Target's years and billlions of data points.     

Games like Splendor, Azul, Century Spice Road all hit the $40 US spot making them better sellers at our store than $50 games."

15166,best tree for the garden,"I gotta push back on the hackberry. I'm in Texas and have several hackberries on my property, and they are by far the ugliest trees I have. Very scraggly, and all of them have developed rotten places on the trunks. They drop thousands of tiny berries that turn into saplings in all my flower beds... the squirrels don't go after them, so nothing cleans up the mess and I'm constantly pulling tiny tree sprouts. Maybe things would be different in MN, but down here I certainly wouldn't recommend them.

Edit: this may also be specific to Texas, but after our big freeze this February, the hackberry trees are constantly dropping leaves."
