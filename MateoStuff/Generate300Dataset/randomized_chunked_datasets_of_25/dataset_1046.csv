30751,"America. It has its issues but you can literally live in any kind of climate or environment you want. There are jobs for nearly every profession and many of those professions are world class with tons of opportunity and growth. There are a lot of things to do here, and it's a great place to experience other cultures and customs without having to leave the country. It has its issues but I'd venture to say there is a pretty good reason why so many people came here and still continue to from all over the world.",best country to live in

You can imagine the disappointment I felt when I tried on a classic pair of Wayfarers and that shit just rested on my cheeks. Doesn't help that I don't wear glasses either so I don't know how good glasses looked/felt. Idk why I got down votes but whatever.

2636,"Depends. I think that there's one fairly sweet spot for iems around $50 (where the Meelec A151, VSD3s etc are significantly better than anything cheaper). Idk about the iems you mentioned. IMO the JVC FXD80 (for less than $70) is almost 90% as good as any of the iems you mentioned. And the westone um3x is definitely a solid step up worthy of the extra money from those iems. 

Dunno about headphones. Im about to buy my first pair of DT880 600 ohm in a day or two, glad to hear you think its the sweet spot. I do forsee it as my endgame for atleast the next 5-7 years. I'll upgrade amps and speakers in the mean while.",best headphones
