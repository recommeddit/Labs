.....why was I surprised this is a thing?
This one should be at the top of the list.
Recently it's been Dirt Rally.

I drink the cheapest brand because they all taste the same but coffee doesn't work for me.
"In the U.S. history book, I recall, we learn briefly of the Texas Independence as a division of the mostly English speaking protestants unable to buy land unless they became Catholic, a general cultural clash. The Alamo and the Goliad massacre were mentioned as well as the victory at the Battle of San Jacinto by Sam Houston.

For the Mexican-American war, it was Manifest Destiny. In this case we were the aggressors that baited Mexican troops in a grey Texas border area that helped spark the war. From there we had the landings at Vera Cruz, the march to Mexico City and its quick capitulation. A lot of the people fought in the war became important military people in the American Civil War. Then debate came up of the possibility of taking all of Mexico, but ended up taking a third because they didn't want all the Spanish speaking Catholics.

Finally the Gadsden Purchase, which was purchased from Mexico to help build a southern rail route to the west. Its purchase was more than what the United States gave to Mexico for the land ceded from the Mexican-American War and was only possible because the Mexican government was is horrific debt from the war.

While that sounds like a lot, class discussion was only 2-3 days at most before moving on to the American Civil War, where that would take over a month discussion. Basically, touched on the highlights in class and read the chapters at home, which most people did not do."
Giorgio Armani Code. The ultimate panty dropper. No matter who wears this it smells amazing!
"growing up in a Filipino household, I always figured a rice cooker was a common kitchen essential, like a microwave. Until I saw my friends' parents cooking rice on the stove top and was very confused."
"if just writing, most tablets will do fine. An Intuos Pro might be overkill but are a very comfy size.

Whats your budget, the smaller intuos bt tablets are cheap and good for non pro art."
"Lowe's is almost always cheaper for the same or equivalent,  so I go there"

Actually winning is better. ;)
"When Home Depot delivered my dishwasher, they didn't even want to take it out of the box for me.  When Lowes delivered my refrigerator, they unboxed it, peeled off all the protective plastic, and hooked up the water supply line."
"Thanks for the additional info. The extra options and workarounds diminish the implied simplicity of Axios a little bit. 

Anyway, it might be good library overall, I have no practical experience with it, but it is not represented well in the article."
"But at the same time, something about Austin makes it 100% Texas too"
"Forgot to mention the pros and cons. Pros - a lot of built-in useful tools, also easy to back up data. Cons - lacks aesthetics."

"I wear prescription sunglasses (since I wear prescription glasses all the time). Mine are Ray Bans (I only own one pair), simply because I liked how they looked on my face & I can't afford to buy new prescription sunglasses every month. Brand name doesn't bother me, so long a they look sensible on my face. Interestingly, the arms of my RayBans do not have a metal arm, they're only plastic, and the size/shape of my head meant they kept falling off until my awesome optician added some [glasses grips](http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/glasses-grips) onto the arms so they're fully adjustable and dont fall off anymore. Yay!"
"Ohh not sure with that metric... But I use 800 dpi and 0.32 sens in valorant if that helps. I try my best to not adjust these when swapping pads, but to just remember off of muscle memory. TBH I might play a hair better by sticking with one pad always, but that's not as fun and I play to have fun üòÅüëç."
"My husband says the CalStates are where poor people go for a better life, while the UC system is more of a finishing school with a metric ton of nepotism."
