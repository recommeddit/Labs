8738,best toothpaste,We are just happy that you are making the effort to floss as well as brush.  We don’t care what order you do it in!
71789,best movies with a cool twist,I just finished Bone Tomahawk. Awesome and totally worth a slow burn.
33882,best Pokemon game,"Personally, my favorites are G/S/C/HG/SS

Red was my first game and I played it to death but by the time G/S/C came out I was a little bit older (maybe 11 or 12) and they were the only pokemon games I had until I was 18 or 19 so I spent many, many hours playing through them, and I appreciated them a bit more than Red as I was a bit older.

So when HGSS came out they were just remakes of my favorite games growing up.

So really, it's completely subjective and everyone will have different reasons for liking what they like.

Personally I also love FRLG, and RSE (I actually like these more than the remakes)

That said, I don't think I've played a Pokémon game that I didn't like, but yeah. My top 3 would be those ones."
43276,best detective show,Dexter also excellent
6668,best iPhone,Yes i agree the battery degradation could be the cause of some of your software issues.
46763,best hand santizer brand,Name brand shouldn't be emotionally attached as good. It can be the best but it doesn't mean that if it is not a name brand expensive one then it is not good. That is genius soul marketing played well.
2455,best headphones,I've had them too for half a year now. Absolutely worth the investment.
68531,best science fiction novel,"Yes, Wool! Fantastic books"

39316,best web browser,"Still no native battle.net.  No native epic, no native gog...   Yes some of those are easy to install but not having native applications is a deterrent to a lot of people."
69486,best major to study in college,"The problem is that a lot of older nurses aren't leaving the workforce. When they start to, the jobs should be there. This unfortunately won't help anyone who has recently graduated or is going to in the short term because if you don't get a job soon after graduation, you're screwed."
27816,best breakfast foods,Don't forget the tatty scones!
20159,best workout music,[Salt in the Wounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phQW1fXmVfc) is my go-to. The tempo just keeps going up and up until I'm sprinting. The Island pt 2 is another good one.
15420,best tree for the garden,[Red Black trees. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)
59486,best perfume,"Ooh okay, this is eclectic. Also very good taste. I'm not sure on gender, but a few things have me leaning towards a woman, and I'm going to guess based on some of the darker scents that you aren't overly femme. Like, it feels like you'd rock a fashionable pantsuit. Probably late-20s and in some kind of artistic field. Not necessarily fully like an artist, but graphic design, working in an art gallery, something like that."
73256,best Linux distro,Thanks for the detailed reply mate! I would love to switch to different distros but I am afraid I will not have the time to do it.
49070,best gaming monitor,I've got the GL850B and it's great but colours are shit out of the box so find a good custom ICC profile
8118,best toothpaste,How much is that in beers?
32422,best vacation resort,"All inclusive resorts are like germ buffets (I thought this before the coronavirus).  They are basically cruises on land and are essentially expensive forgettable moments in time.

For an unforgettable birthday celebration I highly recommend experiences your guests will enjoy and appreciate.   Think food and wine tour of Tuscany or Sonoma.  Rent a houseboat on Lake Cumberland or in Amsterdam.  There are many many many more unforgettable experiences that are a thousand times better than everything an all inclusive resort can offer."
64439,Best Nike running shoes,"Hi. A couple of weeks ago I wrote a [guide to Asics running shoes](http://www.runningshoesguru.com/content/understanding-the-asics-running-shoes-lineup/) that took me forever to write, but was well received.

I spent even more time - a good 2 days - to write the Nike one. Hope it helps!"
55252,best places to hike in the east coast,Hike the Appalachian trail. It’s so beautiful.
16877,best pet for toddlers,"They aren't nocturnal.

The chirping noise is very cute. We always kept ours outside so it wasn't an issue. Don't remember the smell."
55614,best action and adventure novel series,*The Black Company* by Glen Cook. It's one of the original dark and gritty fantasies.
