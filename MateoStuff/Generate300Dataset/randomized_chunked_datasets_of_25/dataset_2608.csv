33882,"Personally, my favorites are G/S/C/HG/SS

Red was my first game and I played it to death but by the time G/S/C came out I was a little bit older (maybe 11 or 12) and they were the only pokemon games I had until I was 18 or 19 so I spent many, many hours playing through them, and I appreciated them a bit more than Red as I was a bit older.

So when HGSS came out they were just remakes of my favorite games growing up.

So really, it's completely subjective and everyone will have different reasons for liking what they like.

Personally I also love FRLG, and RSE (I actually like these more than the remakes)

That said, I don't think I've played a Pokémon game that I didn't like, but yeah. My top 3 would be those ones.",best Pokemon game

I'm not sure on gender, but a few things have me leaning towards a woman, and I'm going to guess based on some of the darker scents that you aren't overly femme. Like, it feels like you'd rock a fashionable pantsuit. Probably late-20s and in some kind of artistic field.

32422,"All inclusive resorts are like germ buffets (I thought this before the coronavirus).  They are basically cruises on land and are essentially expensive forgettable moments in time.

For an unforgettable birthday celebration I highly recommend experiences your guests will enjoy and appreciate.   Think food and wine tour of Tuscany or Sonoma.  Rent a houseboat on Lake Cumberland or in Amsterdam.  There are many many many more unforgettable experiences that are a thousand times better than everything an all inclusive resort can offer.",best vacation resort
