67494,axios alternatives reddit,"I use it, because for whatever reason it worked without additional config whereas fetch didn't like our internal security layers. So we all decided as a group to use axios. I have had to write very little code with it, but it works for what we use it for. I have found cases where it's lacking, like handling query parameters that can be repeated. Sometimes it's been a bit annoying to work around, but it's a pretty simple library. Wish the typescript declarations were better, they seem to not work with generator functions (using it alongside redux saga)."
10517,best suitcase lock,And a starter pistol qualifies as a gun for the TSA's purposes. I know photographers that keep a starter pistol in each of their camera cases.
41557,best instrument to play,"Well, all instruments are difficult. I personally don't see any that is more than all others, but I do see some that are more difficult than other some. In general lines, to me, those instruments on which you can make a good sounding note on the very first day are the easiest. They include the keyboards, tambourine and the recorder, among others. The instruments you need to take months or years to produce a good sounding note are of course the hardest ones. They include the majority of instruments, of which I mention the winds (flute, oboe, trompet etc.) and the strings (guitar, violin, cello)."
26881,best board games,Wow thanks for taking the time to write this! I appreciate :D
12102,best gifts for dad,"This. My husband is inherently cheap (byproduct of his upbringing) so when I know he'll like/can use something, I'll buy him the top of the line. His reactions are priceless & make my day. Strategic Bonus: I often benefit from the cool stuff too & now he's ruined on cheaper versions so he *has* to buy good stuff next time. Win/win."
44297,best items under $100,"My Aetna personal health plan (not HMO) is $83/month. Covers everything, including regular doctor visits and pharmacy, no maximum coverage limit, no coinsurance (100% coverage)... and a $3000 annual deductible. In other words, other than regular doctor visits, you will pay for your own health care up to $3000 a year, but if something bad happens, you're 100% covered no matter how much it costs. And that's what insurance is supposed to be, pooled protection against catastrophic costs."
16642,best pet for toddlers,That's a great idea. At the mall we passed a kiosk that sells hermit crabs and my kids seemed interested. I know they would love setting up a terrarium and watching the crabs even if the crabs aren't affectionate.

5212,best home improvement store,"Home Depot has a decent online site. I don't order much from it but it's a good way to check stock and it even tells you what aisle your thing is per store location. I really appreciate that. 

Lowe's is close to home while home depot is close to work so depending on where I am, that's the one I'll go to usually."
17078,best iOS game,"yeah sorry, I didn't mean to sound like a dick lol, I was just very excited for both of those games and they just let me down massively (especially marvel).

I also like sort of idle games, but elite squad just felt like they didn't put any effort into the gameplay at all, and copied a lot from strike force design wise (like the orbs and style is a massive rip off). I just didn't understand why they couldn't do their original thing, its Ubisoft. I expected more personally. but I'm glad you enjoy them!"

3712,best college for research,"> there are some pretty solid indicators for research scores that allow for a relatively unbiased view.

my point was that they have to be adapted to context. Calculating the arithmetic mean across these different contexts makes it much less meaningful. 

> Although good for nothing else, this map shows how far the integration of non English speaking countries into the Anglo-Saxon academic world has come if only because these locations are included in this list.

Sorry, but not really. As somebody working at one of the ""top"" universities in Germany, the overall ""anglo-saxon first"" bias of these kinds of studies hasn't changed much (and your comment kind of confirms this, too, because your implicit premise seems to be that ""integration into the Anglo-Saxon academic world"" equals ""progress""). 

> The problem is that governing bodies of universities seem to make those rankings their top priorities.

Here I agree with you completely. These kinds of metrics, similar to impact scores or altmetric scores are hurting the overall enterprise of research as such. A lot of the most valuable aspects a place has for research and scholarship might not be quantifiable at all. 

> Although academic competition is not necessarily a bad thing... 

In the current climate I would argue that the drawbacks outweigh the positives by far. The current publish-or-perish way of doing things gives rise to predatory journals, to plagiarism, to things like p-hacking... I would give grants out to people for not publishing anything for three years but to come up with something truly new, regardless of the impact it makes. The idea of innovation and courage is deeply missing from academia as everybody is forced to play it as safe as possible with just another rehash and paraphrasing of stuff that has already been done."

36710,best alcoholic drink,"I was ALL ABOUT vodka cranberries but I'm forever watching my weight and trying to lose a little more so I figured I'd switch the cran out for the soda, BUT, I still get that little cran splash to flavor the drink. So tasty. And then I'm like, ""AND GIVE ME ALL THE LIMES!"" I. Love. Lime."

17391,best iOS game,Oh wow I'm curious now how far the free part goes.  It's a damn intriguing game but short for the price if you're price conscious.  Why don't you IM me  your apple email addy and I'll hook you up.
