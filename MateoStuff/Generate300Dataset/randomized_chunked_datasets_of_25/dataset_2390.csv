47276,"New Orleans, Chicago, Austin, Denver, Portland/Seattle.   Visit those 6, and you will get a good feel for real America.   
  
NY is a global city.   Not truly American culture, and more a melting pot.    LA is not a fun city to visit.   It is so spread out, you spend most of your time driving which is not fun on a holiday.   
   
Vegas is Americans and foreigners getting drunk in nightclubs and sitting by the pool or gambling.   You can have the same experience almost anywhere in the world.   
   
Go to Chicago to see a big American city.   Lots of culture with museums, sports,  it is better for holidaying than other similarly sized US metro's as it has public transport.   
   
Denver is at the foot of the rockies, so you can spend some time in the mountains.   It also has it's own western culture which can be interesting.   
   
Austin is Texan culture, and a live music home.   Everyone should experience Texas at least once in their life.   
   
New Orleans is a great party town.   Get drunk, try some of the local food.  It is everything Vegas pretends to be, but is genuine.   
   
The pacific northwest (Portland and Seattle) are really friendly cities to visit, and different from the rest of the US.   In some ways they feel more European.",best state to visit in the United States
46018,"Most people at my job leave other people's stuff alone. I don't mean leave out as in a candy bowl, I mean we don't have desks and people leave the stuff they're snacking on at the water cooler. The only thing people get so tempted by that they think no one will notice if they take a few (and inevitably more and more until half the bag is gone because they keep going back) is Werthers and Jolly Ranchers.",best trick or treating candy
34574,"He's right there, but I would guess it would be because sacks aren't everything for that position (and all time lists are skewed due to the recency of logging them). For instance, Kevin Greene is 3rd all time in sacks and he was a solid player but nowhere near sniffing these lists. And while Strahan was much better than Greene and one of the best ever at getting after the quarterback, it's a pretty loaded position for the top 100 and he was never seen as the ""bigger than life"" type of game changer like LT or Reggie White or even Bruce Smith. 


I think there's a very strong argument to be in the 90-100 range though. But just missing top 100 ever in a sport with as many positions as football, especially when trying to contextually include players from pre 1960s, isn't a bad thing.",best NFL player

23796,Horizon 2 or Forza 6. Although I will say if they ever brought back a true Gran Turismo experience then that would have a very good shot at dethroning Forza. I still think GT3 is the best racer ever made and there is no reason why we shouldn't have had a racing game at that level by now.,best car racing video game
