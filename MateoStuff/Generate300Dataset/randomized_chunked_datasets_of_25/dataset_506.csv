14035,best place to get free books,"It works really well.  Our library has a lot of cool resources like that.  There's Hoopla, which has movies, music, and graphic novels.
There's an app that lets you download magazines, a service that lets you download drm-free not-obscure music, and there are a couple of other, smaller ebook databases."

64393,best place to pirate mac apps reddit,"If it's not on the App Store then it's probably scattered all over the internet, though the App Store should always be your first port of call.

One thing though - rather than VLC, give IINA a try."

16701,best pet for toddlers,At there age unless you also 100% want the pet I wouldn't get one. Small animals are often praised as great first pets but often they need a lot more care then people think/want to commit to and they often don't like to held or loved on which is mostly what little kids want from a pet. If anything maybe sign up to foster a cat or dog to see how it would fit into your life style.
26698,best board games,"Catan - It is a classic trading game/gathering game. It is great for people who haven't really played big board games before. Also as an introduction to board games beyond Monopoly.

Zombicide Black Plague - This is the fantasy version and is much better rules than the modern day one. This one can scratch the RPG itch easily.

Eclipse - Is an excellent(and complex) 4x board game. We play this at least once every time our group gets together. Massive space exploration and every turn is laden with choices sometime difficult ones.

Sushi-go - This is a great drafting game to get matches and points. Fun for all ages, though a card game...

Tsuro - Fun little game, very simple rules. Placing tiles to move your guy around and trying to move your opponents off the board.

El Grande - Is a good game where you are vying for political influence of areas. No combat, just placing tokens and playing cards to disrupt your opponents influence. Nice Area Control game.

Massmorra/Arcadia Quest - Massmorra is a dungeon delving game where tiles are randomly drawn to build the dungeon. Your heroes level up and gain abilities to aid in defeating the big bad guy. Solo play and VS included. Arcadia quest is a squad game, where your 3 Heros(guild) are competing with other guild for gear/money/exp to level up. In the campaign you work ""together"" to progress(or compete to get better stuff) and the final boss fight you team up and the guild with the most points at the end wins. I listed these together because the characters/models are interchangeable. Same universe.

Forbidden Island - Neat game where you stranded on an Island and have to gather relics before you can leave. Gets much harder at higher player counts.

Tiny Epic .... - any of them are great fun in small packaging. Most people seem to like the Western and Galaxies one. I prefer the Kingdoms one. (though, to be fair I haven't played the western one yet)

Axis and Allies - This is a war games based on WWII for 2-5 players. Well made and historically accurate starting positions. Certain situations the rules can be complex; but, mostly the rules are rather simple.

For me these are the games I would say are my top ten. Cover a good bit of ground and genres. I would be up for playing any of these at almost any time."

The thing i miss in ranger is a menu bar like aptitude has, so I wouldn't always have to browse the help page to remind me of available commands."

16593,best pet for toddlers,"I like this idea. One of my friends rescues rats and they make great pets. They might be hesitant to send a rat home with a young child but it really depends on your kid. Will he understand that he really can't be rough with the rat or rough house around the rat? If he is gentle and calm and understands that if he steps on or rolls on to the rat he will kill it, I think it would be a good fit. They are lovely affectionate animals and if you get one from a rescue you can make sure you get a well socialized rat, they can explain how to avoid any nipping issues, and if it doesn't work out, you can send the rat back to a good home. Just be aware that they don't live a long time."
