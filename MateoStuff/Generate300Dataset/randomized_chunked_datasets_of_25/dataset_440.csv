17619,"Frotz: An essentially unlimited amount of text based adventuring. It comes with a bunch preinstalled, but you can add thousands more games to it for free from the included Free, no ads, no iAP.

Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection: Not the prettiest game out there, but it features a whole bunch of variety, tons of puzzles, and it’s under 4 megabytes. Free, no ads, no iAP.

Pathos: An iOS adaptation of Nethack. Free, no ads, no iAP.

Star Realms: Probably the best digital board game adaptation ever made. It’s a deckbuilder (think Dominion, not Magic: The Gathering), and it’s excellent. The demo will give you a ton of playtime, as it will let you play the base game against the easy and medium bots. A $5 USD iAP unlocks local/online multiplayer/hard bot, and it’s absolutely worth it. Free, no ads, lots of single time (gameplay expanding) iAP, some cosmetic repeat-able iAP.

Epic Card Game: I’m already getting my card game fix from Star Realms, but this MTG draft-ish game is made by the same people as Star Realms. Apparently online play is free in this one, but I haven’t really played it.
Free, no ads (afaik), repeat-able iAP (I have no idea how egregious it is)

Armello: I have 110 hours in the PC version, and the mobile port is just as good. It’s a digital board game (with no physical version?), and it’s totally worth trying. Free, no ads, single time and repeat-able iAP (cosmetic and gameplay expanding).

Fowlst: Action game, like a combat-focused Flappy Bird. It’s sequels have ads/iAP, but the original is completely free. Free, no ads, no iAP.",best iOS game

69874,"Graphic designer here! I'm four years post design school, and I can say there are a lot of pros and not that many cons.

Pros: Good money, especially if you're in UI. Fun, interesting work that changes all the time (my clients range from the food industry to healthcare, to non profit, and almost every other thing you can think of). Very satisfying work--solving problems is fun!

Cons / Words of wisdom: Make sure you go to a school that focuses on a design CAREER, not one that only encourages you to express yourself artistically though design. I have friends that went to the second kind, and most of them are at shitty in-house jobs because they didn't know how to capitalize on their skills or deal with real clients.",best major to study in college

* For everyday (warm): John Varvatos EDT

* For active use: Prada Luna Rossa Sport EDT
* For formal business: Tom Ford Grey Vetiver EDP
* For nights out: Dolce & Gabbana The One EDP
* For intimate times w/SO: Issey Miyake L'Eau de Issey Pour Homme EDT (I've literally been wearing it since I met her, and it's my signature scent for her)
* For intimate time by myself/emotional self-care: Givenchy Xeryus EDT (vintage)

I have plenty of other things (either full bottles or samples) that I wear on the regular, but I picked the first five based on availability/ease of replacement. The Issey will probably always be there for personal reasons.
