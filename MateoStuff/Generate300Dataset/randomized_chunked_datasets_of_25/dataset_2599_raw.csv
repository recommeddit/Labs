Need this right now. Thanks!
"Mind if I ask which one? And if you know whether it's for Android, iPhone or both? I tried a few of the highest rated free VPNs on the play store earlier this year but they were all horrendously slow (I don't think I saw speeds above 20kb/s). I have virgin too, seems they're blocking more and more stuff recently."
"Spazmodic has the right idea, look at the labels. It really depends on the brand, to be honest, but the ones that do take what is basically tap water run their water through reverse osmosis."
I started with audio technica several years ago.  I've upgraded to the ath-anc7b now.  They make excellent headphones for the price.
I prefer console over PC because I prefer controllers and couch gaming on a 60” 4k screen. My PC can only do 1440 at higher refresh and struggle to run new titles at 4k. So i mainly use my PS4 pro. I do have an extensive steam library and enjoy getting g games at a deep discount whenever they run sales. So my playing is maybe 60/40 console to PC.

"Try the Inked. I compare it similar to a Gigantus V1. They both have slower glides than the Zero. The stopping power on them are all comparable, but imo the faster glide on the Zero makes the stopping power feel lower for my very low sensitivity.

I would give a go at the Inked Pad or V1. The largest non-extended Inked Pad is 460mm x 400mm (pretty equal to a QCK/Glorious) so get the V1 if you want something just slightly bigger."
"Because it doesnt rely on watching a whole bunch of marvel movies, making it more open to critics?"
Seems odd to protect the carpet from paint splatter in this situation.
The only thing I can say is to not just leave the bowl outside because the first kid will take all of it. Lights on is usually enough and at least in my neighborhood no one has ever actually been TPd so I don't think you need to worry about it.
"Thanks man!

I touch up contrast, exposure, highlights, and shadows but have been trying to do less color manipulation. Ultimately the best shots are those composed well."

"That and you're well on your way to limb independence, which'll set you up for drums."
"Only had black and browns as my own for a long period of time, and browns are far superior. I've tried reds and blue, but not enough to really have an opinion on them."
"Lunar tempo, not lunar epic. Lunar epic is its own new line and concept."
"There was a time I really liked Aamir. Can’t stand him now. ( his films I still watch )

 His personal life is far from perfect. Has had flings left right n centre while married to Reena. Had a child with a woman and disowned the kid. I also find his relationship with Ira and Junaid complicated. He does seem like a Devoted father to Azad though.

Also both him and his pseudo wife come off as hypocrites.   


I may be in the minority but I have never found SRK witty or charming. His sense of humour is crass and he has made sexist jokes time n again but for some reason theyr seen as funny. But overall he seems to be non problematic as long as you don’t get on his wrong side. And I guess he’s charming. Pretty much all his female costars have validated this. I don’t see it but there must be something.

Akshay - Way more shrewd than he lets on. Extremely money minded.   


Varun - I find him dumb but somewhat adorable. He’s a little cocky but harmless. Seems super nice to fans.

Salman - Have warmed upto him in the last couple of years or so. Mainly because of how relatable he comes across on BB..where He seems super chill and ...one of the guys..ltheres a reason masses connect with him the most out of all the superstars especially on reality shows. Seems to Be there for everyone and does a good amount of charity work but I have no doubt that his PR plays up everything to make him look like a saint. Hes arrogant and does not hide it. Can be a complete ass and insensitive at times. Overall I’m unable to figure him out . But my opinion on him keeps changing every now n then.   


Ranbir - The hardest to figure out. The most complex character in Bollywood IMO. His poker face makes it hard to understand the guy. On top of that pretty much everyone around him says hes not expressive and it can be very frustrating at times. He’s obviously very charming and the fact that he’s hard to understand adds to the aura and mystery around him . Heard that he’s very sweet to fans and completely chill to hang out with . But there’s something about his eyes ..comes off as super cold and not very trustworthy.

Ranveer - Was a huge fan. Not anymore. dont buy the good guy ..’im everyone’s fan’ image anymore. I find him pretentious now. Started disliking him after his sob stories about visiting US just once a year , talking about his family going through hardships ( when according to his BBB director he was the only debutant eve to drive to the studios in his Jaguar ).And I’m sure he loves DP but likes to really really play it up...with his I’m the best BF, I’m the best husband talks... overall harmless but phoney.   


will add more later."
"My degree was in psychology, and I wouldn't change it for the world even though my current career is far from psychology.  I spent four years learning how people work, I enjoyed the classes, and now I leverage that knowledge.  Just look up anchoring in salary negotiations as an example.  My opinion: the key is to learn something you're interested in, then figure out how to apply it."
I feel like E.1999 Eternal is up there especially for their time. brilliant album. otherwise all the others are mentioned here.
"I know, it's the same in almost any market.

My point was more that someone who has not spent more than $20 on headphones is unlikely to see the point in spending 7 times that."
"Tried and true chocolate chip mint.

"I've read six of the 15 in the list - its a good list. Nice seeing Simmons on there. I would say that I'm surprised not to see Asimov though, considering the impact the Robots stories had on the genre."
Tom Hanks.  I worked at Disneyland in the late 90’s and I saw him giving a tour to a group of about 25 kids.  He was leading the tour and the Disney tour guide was just tagging along so I could tell he’d done this many times before.
I'm so excited for season 2 tomorrow.
