"My mom loves pearls. So she asked us kids (and my dad) to focus on that for Christmas. She just wanted pearl jewelry. 

Well, wandering around a Walgreens hair aisle one day, and bam. I find it. A pearl hair clip. I got some nice stuff to go with it, like lotion and other take care of yourself stuff. 

She loves it. She still wears it a lot. Mom lost one, so I bought a 2nd. Of course she finds the first one, and is excited to have two."
Mom bought 13-piece serving set for Grandma for Christmas. After packing in car Mom says she wouldn't mind 13-piece serving set. Bought 13-piece serving set for her.
"The chobani greek yogurt cups are pretty easy except when the cat won't get out of my face when i eat one sitting down, but also you can buy bulk cereal from one of those dispenser things in your local supermarket that is pretty good."
Oh ok wasn't aware that there was MX Greens. What are they like?
">Also, lots of Gautengers/Joburgers drive like utter dickheads

FTFY. The worst thing about tourist season in Cape Town is the influx of GP numberplates on the freeways who don't get that *things are slower in the Cape*."
socal or norcal? i’m looking at staying csu or transferring since i’m transferring anyway
I’ve played for like 7 years now on and off. I’m still amazed at the content the game has and while the early stages are very easy the later parts of the game are very challenging. I have top tier everything but having 0 continue wins is still very challenging.
"Do you have downstairs neighbors? Our downstairs neighbors regularly run their heat to the point that we often have our windows open in the dead of winter. It saves us a lot on our heating bill, but it’s also really annoying to be so out of control of the temperature of our own apartment."

"> (and I've tried in different countries, too, in case American eggs are weird)

What is the nature of your trip today?
Trying to peel these fucking eggs, man. Uh. Pleasure?"
Exactly and I never drop my phones
"If you just buy the cheapest generic ones, you'll get super thin that are basically nothing. Go name brand and you'll probably be fine."
"I tried to rent a goat to mow my lawn once. They told me I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't sexually abuse it. 

That and goats eat EVERYTHING.  Like your fence? Too bad.  The siding on your house? Fucking goats... wait. I can't fuck the goat. DAMMIT!"
"If the phone is not ""slippery"" as X , with that new matte finish, i will go naked.. if it is, i will probably get this one."

"Yeah but part of that will surely be that in a few years, Tammy should still maintain his value, in part because he's English"
Is there an upgrade to the AW3418DW yet?
"new zealander chiming in.

nobody visits unless it's in auckland (where if you want to live, it costs for cold water), there is only one convention, earthquakes are getting closer and bigger (wellington, capital, is due for a big one). the landscape is beautiful but thats only in the country where nobody lives and the internet is shit, our cities are average.

job market is in the toilet, homeless are everywhere."
"Platinum- Fleece-lined jeans. They make going outside in winter soooo much better.

Gold-good quality paint brushes. The difference between a Dollar Store brush and a $16 Home Depot brush when you are painting a wall is night and day."
"Love having COD on mobile! While not next-gen level graphics, they’re damn close, and the game-play, maps, and game-types keep the addiction level HIGH. My Xbox One X is getting zero love lately."
Exactly! You just never knew what was coming next. A great thriller and great twist.
