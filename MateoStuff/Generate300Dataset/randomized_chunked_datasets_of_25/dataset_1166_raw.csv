"Wow, did you? :D I wish I was alive back then, same goes to Planet of the Apes. Should've been a mini heart attack for people when these two happened in the cinemas!"
Am I the only one who has a strong preference for the  miniatures though? It's just something about the ratio of chocolate to peanut butter..
But it will be configured in ad meditation right?
"From the perspective of someone usually working out in a silent powerlifting gym, I have tried the silence thing and it sometimes works excellent to almost sort of take a break from music, but I have to say ever since I got a fixed warranty pair of my earbuds back I much prefer it with music again. Which is weird because the gym has a first come first serve boombox I can aux any device into but I still prefer the odd serenity of not sharing my music.. And if I'm high it makes me blaze through an otherwise possibly tedious workout on a day I don't like or something. 
Anyway, it's an interesting concept"
"1. Contigo travel coffee mug (I think it was like $13 -15). Coffee stays hot for hours, and I stopped buying coffee at Starbucks.
2. Bluetooth speaker- ($10 on Black Friday) elevated my life in ways I couldn't even imagine. I listen to NPR while getting ready in the morning, music while showering, or a podcast while cooking. If it breaks down I will promptly re-purchase it at full price ($40).
3. Spotify Premium ($10/month, comes with Hulu). I use Spotify like 5+ hours a day.

EDIT: I forgot I pay an extra $5/month for Hulu, but it is clubbed with Spotify. I am not a student, just a regular Spotify user. The Hulu is with ads however, and you can't pay extra to get the ad-free version."
I play with 4 and we can finish a scenario in 1 hour. We also use gloom haven helper for less bookkeeping and more playing
"I've only read rendezvous, childhoods end and 2001, and really enjoyed all of them. While they may be a bit slow I never find them boring, and rendezvous is probably one of the faster paced ones, jumping into action pretty quickly!"
Adam Sanders is great
It even gets worse the older they get. Once the kids are grown up and supporting themselves they can just buy whatever the hell they want whenever they want. Stuff they don't even need.
"And blue bell has *damn* good cookies and cream ice cream. 

Cookies Two Step is a national treasure and we always have it in our freezer. When my husband and I first started dating (before this flavor came out) I preferred Cookies and Cream, he preferred Cookie Dough. We always bought one of each. When two-step released I knew it was a fateful sign of our inevitable union from the dairy gods"
If you use fleece with guinea pigs you only have to sweep daily and wash weekly. They are super easy. We have two. Quite easy as a pet and they don't need constant attention like a dog or cat.
"Short glass full of ice, 1 shot khalua, 1 shot rum top off with half and half cream."
Lee Kuan Yew.  Took a country from poverty to excellence.
"I'd say it usually takes about a week. Not all of my requests have been fulfilled, but most have."

"Rockstar pure zero silver... tastes like the white monster, also no sugar, has more caffeine, and being a rockstar, it’s affordable"
Hike Mount Washington. It’s a beast. Or the High Peaks of the Adirondacks. That’ll keep you busy!
Kinda but not really. De Boer had more playmaking skills whereas Müller is a better poacher. But i see your point and his name springs first to mind when i try to make a comparison with a active player.
"I played for a month or so but fell off. It was super polished but the controls didn’t feel very responsive and the content felt very limited/repetitive. 

I’m curious if much has changed, or has it just been more similar content?"
There are dozens of us!
"Besides the many mentioned, Mission Impossible:Fallout is fairly exceptional."
"Someone possibly on this subreddit recommended The Wild Episode. A calmly spoken fantasy author tells a story about an obscure animal species for 30 minutes or so, it’s great."
I love Tobacco Rose!  Could you give me your impression of Legare?  I’ve had my eye on that one for a while
"In Toronto, if you have a Canadian passport you can scan it to a computer without having to talk to border patrol. Makes things much faster."
"Hi, Benq ex2510 or Msi Optix MAG251rx, which has better color, is there a difference between 8bits vs 10bits? the frequency does not interest me.

I was looking for a monitor with certain specifications, if anyone knows of a model that meets this specs I would appreciate it very much!

24 inch, 144hz or more, ips, 1ms gtg, 10bits native or frc

I only found 2 monitors: Msi Optix MAG251rx and ASUS ROG Swift PG259QN"
