23409,best car racing video game,Any of the main line Dirt series if you want a racing game with a more arcade feel. Dirt Rally if you want to be challenged. World Rally Championship or WRC are also fun. A nice balance of realism and arcade-like controls. F1 series is great and honestly I was shocked how much I liked Need for Speed Heat.

7790,best laptop for general use,"Hello, 

I'm slightly overwhelmed with the choices and different recommendations from friends, so I'm wondering if you can help me. 

- My budget is £500-£600 (So the $600-$799 range).
- SSD for sure
- 8GB ram ideally
- Decent battery life, maybe 4 hours (my current one is 0 so anything is a step up)
- For general use, streaming netflix, photoshop, also potentially video editing (would you recommend a higher budget for something like this?)

Thanks ever so much for any advice."

Just pick a major. Being undecided all 4 years won't look great on your first resume unless you leave undergrad with some amazing experience that translates into an immediate position."
16218,best sunglasses for fashion,"On AliExpress you can find a brand called ""Elitas"" that have aluminum framed sunglasses with polarized lenses for like $8 in a variety of styles. I have 3 pairs of them that I ordered 2 years ago and they've held up fine. The downside is it takes around a month to get them delivered. I think Amazon might carry them but they're $15-20 each"

54868,best water filter,"I thought the same thing, that activated carbon does indeed bind organic compounds. The source of the confusion may be that his measurements do not measure the types of organic compounds that are absorbed. It is possible to miss large swaths of different types of organic compounds, depending on how your mass spec is set up."
