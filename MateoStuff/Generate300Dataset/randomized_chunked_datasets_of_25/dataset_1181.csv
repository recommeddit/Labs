23409,Any of the main line Dirt series if you want a racing game with a more arcade feel. Dirt Rally if you want to be challenged. World Rally Championship or WRC are also fun. A nice balance of realism and arcade-like controls. F1 series is great and honestly I was shocked how much I liked Need for Speed Heat.,best car racing video game

7790,"Hello, 

I'm slightly overwhelmed with the choices and different recommendations from friends, so I'm wondering if you can help me. 

- My budget is £500-£600 (So the $600-$799 range).
- SSD for sure
- 8GB ram ideally
- Decent battery life, maybe 4 hours (my current one is 0 so anything is a step up)
- For general use, streaming netflix, photoshop, also potentially video editing (would you recommend a higher budget for something like this?)

Thanks ever so much for any advice.",best laptop for general use
