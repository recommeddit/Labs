"Peace and quiet. Whether that means hubby taking the baby out for a while, or getting me a massage/haircut/pedicure/etc. something where I can hear my own thoughts for once."
It does have a similar level of content to the beano though
"In no order

Dune series, Herbert

Hitchhiker’s Guide series, Adams 

Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, PKD

Steel Beach, Varley

Martian Chronicles, Bradbury 

Book of the New Sun series, Wolfe

Stories of Your Life and Others, Chaing

Western Lands Trilogy, Burroughs (vaguely SF)

Saga-graphic novels, I’m new to this series and may not be my favorite but goddamn is it good"
"Have you actually listened to The Score? I mean there are some R&B and Soul songs on it, but that album is very Hip-Hop. I'd say Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is a crossover album, but The Score is straight up Hip-Hop with a little bit of other stuff."
Awesome doesn't necessarily imply something good.
"I'd take Disneyland over both, and it's really no contest."
"I use one with a thinner U and it goes right through the holes of the zipper pulls. 

Does it provide actual safety? No. 
Does it deter people from craming around or pick pocketing? Yes."
Came here just to post this.
">Get a life Brendan Eich fan who believes Brave is the second coming of Christ. You have to watch like 44 ads and still get like 3.2 BAT. Do something with your life instead of praying to Brendan and Brave everyday when you wake up. You have fallen too deep into a MLM scheme where the employees earn money from displaying so much ads while you make like 1 BAT. Your 2 working braincells don't have the capacity to understand that this is just an MLM scheme.

Aww, did I scare you so you deleted your comment? Are you afraid of the mods little Brave shill? Don't cry my little shill. Go on shilling Brave!"
"He's really a total sweetheart! I saw him at a few shows (he plays guitar with Alice Cooper) and after the set ended he leaned down from the stage to give me a hug. Smiling the whole time. I greeted him with ""Captain Jack!"" and he laughed, even though I was just a kid. Nicest dude!"
"Probably not a good idea for international travel, like what the video is talking about. The various gun laws would make it a headache for sure."
"I'm at work where Youtube is blocked, but there is a video that shows just how easy this is. You insert a pen into the zip to separate the teeth, and when you're done, just slide the zipper handles around and they will reseal. If you did in fact lock it with cable ties in a way that restricts movement of the handles, it's up to the TSA agent to duct tape your bag back together or not. They would probably just cut the tie though."
"A quick question, what is your opinion on ExpressVPN?"
"Sorry, I must admit I probably got in over my head here, [will these suffice](http://www.halopure.com/what/scientific-papers)?"
Any Hucci song tbh.
"My dad's father died in June, 7 years ago. For Father's Day that year, I asked an artistic friend to sketch a picture from an old photo. It's a charcoal drawing of my grandfather holding a 2-year-old me on our family's favorite beach, and it's been prominently displayed in the house ever since."
"It wasn't just that it was filtered tap water. Apparently the filtration process Dasani used in the UK actually added a carcinogen (retailers pulled all Dasani from their shelves after the uproar). It also didn't help that when launching the product in the UK, they used the strapline 'Bottled Spunk' (I shit you not). American readers will have to ask a friendly Brit what that means (it's not a good word) - it's certainly not something you'd normally expect to find in your water!

Basically, the UK launch of Dasani was the finest ever example of how not to launch a new product. Naughty Coca Cola."
"I would have to say either guitar, or timpani drums"
"Just be aware it is a prematurely canceled series, there is a drive to get the next season airing on a new platform though!"
MH751/752 is the best option for headsets
That's such a wonderful idea. I know my Mum would love something like that. Mind if I steal it?
"(for reference, i'm using the old wacom intuos P S tablet) - I had the same question a few days ago, since I was trying to use goodnotes, but writing with a tablet plugged into my mac was godawful (I could barely write words at all, they would just show up as dots, but my tablet wrote fine in other apps like onenote.)

However, I just realized that goodnotes updated their mac app like six days ago, and the writing is working just like other annotating apps now! plus, I noticed mine works with pressure sensitivity."
I'd recommend the [**HP 15s**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=728909&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fcomputing%2Flaptops%2Flaptops%2Fhp-15s-eq1510sa-15-6-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-256-gb-ssd-silver-10207935-pdt.html) then.
Apple trees cos you pick the apples then rot the apples then drink the apples then get really drunk on the apples.
