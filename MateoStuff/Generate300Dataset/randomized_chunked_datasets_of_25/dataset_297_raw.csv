My bedroom is completely red (not walls but furniture and curtains).... whoops
"These two books (and authors) convinced me to give the romance genre more of a look...well-written, good characterizations of both the male and the female lead, funny, and actually romantic:

Jennifer Crusie [Bet Me](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/854757.Bet_Me)

Jill Shalvis [Instant Attraction](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5392768-instant-attraction)"
"""The City and the Stars"" - Arthur C. Clarke

""The Icarus Hunt"" - Timothy Zahn

And I'm not sure for my third. Maybe ""Leviathan Wakes"" by James S. A. Corey or ""Day of the Triffids"" by John Wyndham"
"Bring home dinner from her favorite restaurant, and then hold the baby while she eats it.  Every night for a week.  Bring flowers so she can see something bright and cheerful to remind her that you love her.  Hire someone to help clean and/or cook.  Write her a letter telling her how much you appreciate her.  With a baby that little, eating really is one of the hardest things, especially if she's breastfeeding.  You're always hungry and every time you try to make something the baby knows and screams.   Maybe books or magazines or a kindle or something if she likes to read while sitting with the baby, or netflix or something like that if she prefers to watch TV."

Total Recall
"GraphQL could return both data and errors in the same request, so it's not really a failure. Though a GraphQL server will definitely fail sometimes and will return other codes (400s, 500s) and I'd find it convenient if these were treated as failures. And yes, I'm using an abstraction for GraphQL, Apollo, since, again, implementing it myself is another non-trivial tasks and it would be dumb not to use the right tool for the job.

I'm not doing anything deep, I just had to use all of these (Fetch, Axios, Apollo) while working on huge applications with a distributed team. All the examples I'm sharing are abstraction layers needed on top of Fetch to have a convenient and self-documenting request lib API. Which I think is relevant on a post about axios."

"Hi. I'm a teacher and write on mine all day. I've had matte screen protectors on mine for years. If your primary goal is taking notes, then you will appreciate matte. I do watch a lot of media on my 12.9 also and it it is brighter without the matte protection on but not to the point that it's unusable. I wouldn't sacrifice the inferior writing experience of not using a matte protector to gain some improvements for Netflix etc. With the matte protector on, it's still an enjoyable experience watching media. Just my two cents"
"hmmm... late thirties / early 40s male. clearly you have good taste. live in a larger city, your apartment is nicely decorated and very clean."
yes.
A humidifier! Gone are the days of waking up every day in the winter with a sore throat and a crackly voice.
"Omg the shaved chocolate chips, why do no other major brands do this?????"
"Red Dead Redemption 2

Its the best looking and most immersive open-world game I've ever played. It has some dark parts and creepy random encounters. The controls are clunky but you can do a lot with them. Getting proficient with them gives a sense of accomplishment. The game may be slow paced in a lot of parts, but it fits the setting."
I love jasmine but this just smells like mothballs and gasoline on me. My skin is weird.
"Weird, 4 safeties on this list and the best one in the league is not here lol"
"Take the Yeezus off. Take the Oxymoron off. Matter of fact dont redo it if you're going to add bullshit. Oxymoron is hell weak even in this era. Really? Was Man of the Year that big of a deal? ASAP Rocky did miles better if youre going to add something new or even SpaceGhost Purrp - BMW. Run The Jewels is still something I have yet to come across anywhere else but Reddit, so save that horseshit too. If you cant add to the discussion just keep out boy."
">  I lost a lot of respect for him after he ran as a Democrat and a number his followers decided to abandon all forms of meaningful discourse.

How is this something that you can levy a criticism on him for though?  Did he say, or do anything to encourage that?"
"Seventeen, paying subscriber of The Denver Post."
How is the owner terrible?
"If you are painting the whole house for smell it might be good to prime the whole house with something like killz after washing the walls(I think itâ€™s TSP for really bad smells, but you could start with just some soapy water.)

Then a few generic cream/off white/gray until you get your flooring/furniture.  And donâ€™t just do one color through the whole place, it will feel too generic/apartment like. 

Or you can get samples and paint it on the primed walls to get a feel for the color."
"Good choice, I _love_ Richmond, and itâ€™s often overlooked because itâ€™s so close to DC. What a great town though."
They did!
