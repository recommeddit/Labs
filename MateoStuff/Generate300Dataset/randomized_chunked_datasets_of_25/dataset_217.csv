For the backend JavaScript works as well, but you'll have much more fun with Go or Ruby in the long term, and if you want to easily find a job as a backend developer you could look into C# or Java. You probably also need to know a bit of SQL.",best programming language for web development

I frequently edit photos and frankly it's too much work on my phone. 

I'm looking for a monitor that serves ONLY the purpose of photo and video editing. I'm in the lookout for an IPS panel, 22/23/24 inch size, and HIGH Color accuracy. I have come across some that offer 72% NTSC. Will it suffice? Do i need more NTSC than that? (Sorry noobie here)

68539,"The reason Foundation makes those lists is because it offered something really *new* and to an extent created an entire subgenre. In the 40s and 50s when it was written, there really wasn't anything like it, at least in terms of dealing with a long-term drawn-out conflict within a galactic empire. 

The Expanse doesn't offer anything particularly new in that sense (that's not to say the book series/show doesn't entertain). Localized space conquest and exploration isn't all that uncommon. Conflicts between a colonized solar system (Earth/Mars) show up all over the place in works as well knows as KSR's Mars Trilogy. A conflict that starts somewhat similar to the Expanse- in the sense of Earth/Mars followed by (admittedly different) large scale exploration can also be seen in works far more obscure, like Hegemonia (a fun older videogame) or Freelancer. 

That's pretty much why Foundation and a few other classic novels hit the list. You probably couldn't have the newer novels without their influence.",best science fiction novel
