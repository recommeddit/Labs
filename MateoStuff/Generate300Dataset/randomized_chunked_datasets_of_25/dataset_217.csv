5648,best programming language for web development,"For the frontend you'll pretty much have to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, after that you can progress into various JavaScrupt frameworks (Vue.js is relatively easy & fun to use, and with React it's easy to find a job; Angular is the hardest to learn).

For the backend JavaScript works as well, but you'll have much more fun with Go or Ruby in the long term, and if you want to easily find a job as a backend developer you could look into C# or Java. You probably also need to know a bit of SQL."
13731,best research paper archive,[Einstein's 1905 paper describing special relativity](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/) is a remarkably easy read; efficient and graceful.
54681,best water filter,"I'm just saying, it isn't like Zerowater has a design flaw here. The side effect of filtering at the level Zerowater does causes the issue it does. There *shouldn't* be bacteria in municipal water, but it doesn't mean there isn't.

And I agree, there are stronger filters, such as getting a reverse osmosis filter, but I don't suggest those unless you absolutely need it's abilities (most of them aren't fire and forget setups for the average person, and the ones that are are very expensive)."

Consistent drinking: Rockstar Recovery, primarily lemonade.

Really tasty but probably easy to get sick of: Bang Key Like Pie

Bang for your buck: Venom Watermelon Lime or Strawberry Apple, $1 each! 

Other highlights: Monster Juice Papillon, Reign Orange Dreamsicle, Monster Ultra (White, though the whole line is solid too)"
62896,Best Data Science textbook,"[Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman's Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) is one of the most well-written mathematical texts I've read. Coming from geometric function theory, I especially appreciate the geometric point of view. Bonus: [Free PDF online](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/download.html)!

Beyond a solid theoretical foundation like that found in Hastie, et al, I've found the best teacher to be experience."
45407,best gaming system,"I play most games online with friends on pc. I play as many turn based games as I can on the switch including xcom and battle brothers which I also own on PC. Other than that I only use the switch to feel bad about myself by playing smash bros with my younger brother. I also have a ps4 which I’ve only played a few singleplayer games, but i feel like those few games have made it worth the purchase price. (Rdr2, ghost of tsushima, god of war, spiderman)"
56863,best desktop monitor,"Hi, I have a shitty 5 year old laptop(with poor color accuracy) and little money in my bag.

I frequently edit photos and frankly it's too much work on my phone. 

I'm looking for a monitor that serves ONLY the purpose of photo and video editing. I'm in the lookout for an IPS panel, 22/23/24 inch size, and HIGH Color accuracy. I have come across some that offer 72% NTSC. Will it suffice? Do i need more NTSC than that? (Sorry noobie here)

Compensating for buying a new machine with a color accurate monitor and a SSD for the laptop.

Please advice some monitors, will be grateful forever!"

40815,best instrument to play,"This is not true. I knew a man who was incredibly strange and played a theremin he built himself. He also had many other hobbies. 

You would not want to know him better.

I will not add more detail about who he was because he probably has a reddit account and goes on frequently."

3384,best webcamera,"I bought a c920 not just for streaming, I also bought a Razer Seiren Microphone not just for streaming.

You can still purchase good gear if you want to, they have more uses than just for streaming, if you're looking to drop some dosh on high end gear but are worried that it'll go to waste on streaming, think about what else they can used for."

68539,best science fiction novel,"The reason Foundation makes those lists is because it offered something really *new* and to an extent created an entire subgenre. In the 40s and 50s when it was written, there really wasn't anything like it, at least in terms of dealing with a long-term drawn-out conflict within a galactic empire. 

The Expanse doesn't offer anything particularly new in that sense (that's not to say the book series/show doesn't entertain). Localized space conquest and exploration isn't all that uncommon. Conflicts between a colonized solar system (Earth/Mars) show up all over the place in works as well knows as KSR's Mars Trilogy. A conflict that starts somewhat similar to the Expanse- in the sense of Earth/Mars followed by (admittedly different) large scale exploration can also be seen in works far more obscure, like Hegemonia (a fun older videogame) or Freelancer. 

That's pretty much why Foundation and a few other classic novels hit the list. You probably couldn't have the newer novels without their influence."
