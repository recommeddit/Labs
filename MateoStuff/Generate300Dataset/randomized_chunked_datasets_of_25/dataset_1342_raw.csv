Is there any science to back up the dairy-mucus connection? That's pretty interesting.
the fact that he only did 2.5 shots is really something to me. why not just go for 3...
"It's not that easy. I'm an American living in Scandinavia, and things are not that simple. Wish I could elaborate, but on my phone right now.

To give you some examples of missing conveniences, Amazon same-day, beer growlers, Uber, ubiquitous corner stores, cheap and tasty restaurants and food carts on every block, places that are open late so you can go after work. Things a lot of people in Sweden and Norway aren't even aware exist.

In terms of integrating, being able to use English is nice but doesn't bridge the culture gap completely.

Don't gut me wrong, it's a nice place to live and I'm glad I moved, but it's not that simple."
"I make a breakfast hash on Sunday‚Äôs that could go for three or four meals. Matty Mattheson‚Äôs Breakfast Hash recipe is about the closest thing to what I make. It‚Äôs as easy as saut√©ing a few things and baking for 15 mins. Takes about an hour in total to prep/cook.

I don‚Äôt use jalape√±os or radishes, but add sausage (cooking before the potatoes) and any other seasonal veg I like!"
"Very nice review, great read. It has great humor which makes it easy and fun to read.

I don't own all mice you mentioned, but I agree on many things you've said. I also would recommend the XM1 to almost any type of claw. This mouse is seriously the best mouse I have ever used for said grip.

People need to take into account a mouse works best with X grip. I play pure fingertip grip, so unlike your opinion, I do like small and ultra light weight mice. At 19x9.5cm I like the Model O-. I'd probably like the UL2 too (maybe even more since it feels smaller in hand I've read).

Hoping for that XM1 mini or a XM mouse with a bigger hump to use knuckle claw with!"
AMEN to the sidecar!! Several times I've ordered it at a bar and had to teach the bartender how to make it.

"As someone who binged watched the series for the first time on Netflix yesterday (yes I was awake all night and most of the next day, barely left the couch) I can attest how each episode pretty much left me guessing. 

Not to give any spoilers to anyone but geez the time factor in the episode you mentioned is what had me fucked up the most. Also White Bear, and Shut up and Dance. Wow! I kinda wish I could go back and watch it all over again not knowing anything."
"I'm pretty sure that Uruguay is the only country with a population lower than 40 or 50 million to have ever won a World Cup and this was ages ago. Considering their population size, Portugal and the Netherlands have done really well over the years. The European Championship is also dominated by the same bigger countries."
very cool indeed
"It's not uncommon. It may be that as it's considered her job to care about such things, she gets to remember everyone else's birthday and be sure they each get their own cake, but as it isn't anyone else's job, she never gets given cake herself. 

It can happen where there is no abusive intent, for example when the husband lacks empathy skills. [Here is an example so common the therapist made a composite story of it ](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/married-with-undiagnosed-autism-why-women-who-leave-lose-twice-0420164)

""When he does not acknowledge her birthday, and she asserts that his behavior has upset her, he may respond that he did not mean to upset her; therefore, she shouldn‚Äôt be upset. Or he might tell her that because birthdays come once year and everyone has them, they are no big deal and she should stop making such a big deal about them. Or he could tell her they celebrated her birthday last year. Or that birthdays are for children. In other words, he may hold her to the same idea regarding birthdays he holds himself. ""

""She does it because it is important to her, for example, that the children‚Äôs birthdays are celebrated. She wants them to have fun. She wants them to have one special day a year that is all about them. She sees this as normal.

Daddy doesn‚Äôt agree, so he doesn‚Äôt participate.""

""Mommy does it all, from the planning to the present buying to the cake decorating, at home or at the bakery. She chats with all the parents who bring their own children to celebrate. She cleans up after the party. She is exhausted. She says so. Her husband may respond by saying, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre the one who had to have this big party! You asked for it.‚Äù He may not help with the cleanup because, well, it was ‚Äúher idea to have the party.‚Äù

""...She is not thinking the children learn how to treat their mother by observing the way their father treats her."" 

""She is operating on the assumption her children know her and love her and they see she is a good person. She is unaware that negative lifelong attitudes toward her are being formed in the young minds of the children she loves so dearly..."""
