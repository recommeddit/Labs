"IMO my top ticks are the StreamCam first, C922 second, and C920 third. All great cameras. The C920 is the gold standard for webcams. The other 2 have updated performance and features that may or may not fit what you're looking for. Again, I cannot stress how important lighting is. Thats what frustrates me about some of the reviews out there is that they only look at basic out-of-the-box performance and don't try to squeeze the best look out of it."
Drinking a lot of water.
"Kylie, Kim, Kourt, Khloe, Kendall"
"He and I had a funny encounter. We were both at a coffee shop in the Bowery at like 6:30 AM. We were the only ones there. He'd ordered a fancy drink of some sort so had to stand there and wait. I ordered a filter but it was a long process pour over type thing.

So he and I were stood there next to each other for 3-4 minutes. It was awkward because I don't really talk to celebrities / public figures. But at the same time it was weird because it was just the two of us and it was obvious I knew who he was.

In the end I gave him the chin nod. He winked and gave me the chin nod. That cleared the air and we were able to get on with our day."
Don't use their current ODI colors. Then it will all just be different hues of Green and Blue with a maroon thrown in.
So you pull the bristles out because they are plastic and can't be composted? Are they not waste at that point?
"I bought a Case-Mate Karat Marble Case for my new iPhone 13 Pro Max and it has little bumps to ensure the phone lies flat on its back - I’m obsessed! This detail wasn’t obvious in the product photos online, so I was pleasantly surprised at the quality when it rocked up and adore how the bottom half blends into clear to show the gorgeous gold iPhone colour. So so happy with my choice, DM me if you want me to send you a photo"
"Fuck the bag! Lightwood laminate, lightwood laminate!"
"Firefox > Vivaldi/Iridium/Edge (Chromium) > Edge > Chrome (ignoring privacy related stuff, it's pretty barebones & performs shit compared to most other Chromium browsers. Only Opera felt heavier than Chrome)"
Where can you watch the original killing series in Danish? I was looking for it and all that I came up with was the American version. Thanks
Obligatory TI Nspire CAS post.
That's not the twist. The twist is at the police station prior to that.
"This is a great option, I'll be sure to mention it in my family plan video."
"Sally Struthers probably. She's a total sweetheart and her and I got along really well last Summer. I'll be seeing her again soon.
Also, Bush Sr. was a pretty cool guy, but that was about it. 
And Caroline Rhea was absolutely hilarious.

Richard Kind has to be the most annoying mother fucker I have ever met in my whole life.

EDIT: I have also met Charles Shaughnessy, Christian Hoff, Rachel York, Stefanie Powers, Carson Kressley, Rex Smith, Georgia Engel, Lorenzo Lamas, Cady Huffman, and Jen Cody. Ah, the benefits of working in a musical theater."

Thanks for this recommendation!  Really enjoyed the breakdown and eye opening look into data mining.

"I wish I went for English or audio engineering. Instead, I'm stuck in psychology. Sucks to find out that I don't actually want a career in psychology, but I've sunk too much time and money into it to switch now. I'm getting my master's in English though, so at least I have that to look forward to."
Its such a beautiful day
"Honestly, I prefer Tatsu to Twisted Colossus. It's much more comfortable, longer, more diversified, crazy, fun, and the atmosphere kicks ass. Mostly it's just so damn fuuuuun.

I love X2, but it sure beat the shit out of me last time I rode it. I rode outside the first two times, but the last time I rode inside, 5th row. And I felt like I was dying the whole time. It was truly just as rough as the fabled legends told. But on the outside I found it to be absolutely incredible."
"Cheap toothpaste works just fine, the important part is that it contains fluoride (>1'000ppm for adults). And you have to brush (gently, not forcefully, no point making your gums bleed) for a full two-three minutes. With a toothbrush that isn't frayed, so get a new one per month...

Fluoride works but it's not instantaneous, so in addition to mechanical cleaning (brushing) it just needs time. If you're a quick 15-second brusher then no matter how good your toothpaste is, it just won't do much.

It's just like a washing machine, detergent obviously works but the effect is not instantaneous either hence it's not done in a minute."
"I'm a huge fan of the Spigen Liquid Air cases, been using them since the iPhone 6+. 15 bucks and they last about 3 years. They give both screen and lens protection in that the edges around the front and around the camera are raised enough to protect both. The cases also don't add much bulk to the phone and the rear is textured for easy grip."
"Have you tried saily?

"It's simply the high speed movement of the bristles. They hit your teeth with higher energy, more times, in more places, than a manual toothbrush."
