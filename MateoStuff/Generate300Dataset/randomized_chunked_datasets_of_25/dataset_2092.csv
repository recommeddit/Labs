58283,best cologne,"As a lady, straight up traditional old spice deodorant in the pits. That's it. 

Get one whiff of that scent, my heart starts racing and my panties are done for.  It's caused me a couple awkward i have to go to the bathroom right now and deal with my dirty thoughts moments with guys I wasn't dating nor interested in being with (hopefully they didn't notice my blushing).  I think its a Pavlovian response via an association I made between old spice and boys I crushed on in high school."
13385,best spreadsheet editor,Why do you think one can make one better?
71897,best movies with a cool twist,"An old sailor told me once, ""it was like going home.""

The parallel to his wife's death, and the reassurance from Cutter that it was painless at her funeral. Only years later does he rectify that by saying that drowning was, agony."

27744,best bollywood actor,Sorry.
66630,best soccer team in the world,"I don't really understand the feeling of

> I wanna be a fan

Just watch football and you'll see which teams you like and which not. I think ""being a fan"" doesn't work by basing your ""love"" for a club on facts or titles someone tells you.

You like Balotelli? Watch Liverpool and see if you can't miss a match of them after that.

Or watch Bundesliga and be impressed by that brilliant team from Berlin in blue and white with their little flag as logo.

Just watch it and have fun, the rest comes by itself."
72988,best Linux distro,"I use Arch because I like KISS and rolling release, but sometimes updates are broken without using AUR. Just the official repos.

I have thought on installing Tumbleweed (OpenSuse rolling release). Can somebody give me any feedback of that?"
63321,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Just wait until Lime comes out. That's what Sileo should have been.
35338,best alcoholic drink,"My go to. Called ""angry balls"" in my neck of the woods. But i do whatever i can to get a cinnamon whiskey that isn't fireball. Shit tastes like an angry cinnamon altoid mixed with paint thinner."
38526,best newspapers to read,"I would be getting the newspaper.

One winter I paid upfront for 6 months worth then wanted it cancelled. I had to do nothing when 6 months was up. 6 months later more or less it stopped being delivered. Maybe a year later I was going to sign up permanently. Wasnt moving or anything. Except they claim I owe them like $20 for them delivering the paper after the 6month period.

I couldnt possibly know if they did or not go beyond. I never asked them to. If the delivery idiot didnt stop. It's his fault. I refuse to pay that $20. Then because of that debt they refuse to deliver the paper.

Opps there loss of business. Considering how they are dying.. you'd think they'd want as many customers as possible."
2629,best headphones,"edit: nevermind :)

Don't hate on the E100 til you try it!

I didn't have high expectations for it since it was just 12 dollars, but after buying them they have set a new bar for IEMs/Earbuds for me. They crushed all my other earbuds no contest. I used to hate listening on the go since I was used to the sound from my HE-400s. While the E100 aren't as good as the hifimans, the don't make me regret going outside. Very worth trying for 12 dollars.

I'd love to see a video of you reviewing the E100s! (go into it with low expectations and youll be surprised)"

26357,best politician,Or a team of very dedicated volunteers who will go back through your social media history to the beginning of time and delete the sketchy stuff or come up with a strategy to address it if it appears in the media.
5493,best home improvement store,"Buy your material from the contractors.

Lately I've been doing tons of exterior work. If you need to do some soffit/fascia/gutters/siding/caulking/windows/doors etc, just come to my shop between 7:00-8:00, we're happy to sell you our material. The markup we throw on is minor, you'll still pay a lot less than the big box stores, and you can get advice from real installers on whatever you need to do. At my shop we're happy to explain every detail, and set things up for walk-ins like you.

Whatever job you need done, call the best contractor in town, and ask them if you can come in to talk to the guys and buy material."
6949,best iPhone,"For me, 3G, faster speed and a new design were not “so much”. The plastic case was a bug let down and I wanted GPS. Seemed like a step back to me. 

Although the loss of headphone jack and 3D touch were much bigger steps backward IMO."
65486,best phone service company,"tracfone 

90 day $19.99 plan [no data] works out to $22.01 with the fees, or about $7.34/month

If you buy this plan on the tracfone website you can add in an extra 365 days for ~ $50 more = $75.00 with fees for 15 months, about $5/month

I use this for SMS 2-factor verifications and a ""dump"" number for corporations. The phone is forwarded to my Voip provider so I don't use Tracfone's voicemail or Tracfone's minutes, usually. I can always make phone calls out if needed, if perhaps I can't reach my Voip provider. It also solves my 9-1-1 problem if I'm mobile.  

There is a very limited amount of minutes, but since minutes roll over with active service I have over a thousand at this point. Reading an SMS costs 1/3 of a minute."

23527,best car racing video game,"My Summer Car! It's not entirely a racing game, and even though you start with a crap car... You're stuck with a crap car. You can get better parts for it though.

Dirt Rally championship mode comes to my mind. You have to buy your vehicle, and you get money from rallying, so start with the 70's car and climb your way from there."
12695,best gifts for mom,"Oh god, fuck yes. Best gift my husband ever got me."
16944,best iOS game,"My top 5 would be 
1) call of duty mobile(FPS game)

2) arena of valor(moba similar to league of legends)

3) modern combat 5(I used to play this game the whole time just when they added in the shield class and when more P2W I quit)

4)age of civilization(my phone isn’t as strong to play game so I usally just reduce down the size of map in editor, I think it is called age of history now, basically EU4 mobile and is grand strategy game)

5) be a hard choice of many games"
