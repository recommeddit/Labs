Just trying to keep you from getting sued, Tom."
2921,best headphones,tbh i find the DT 770 a little bit superior if you tend to listen to more music.
58783,best cologne,"I bought a bottle of Aqva because it was so highly rated. Sadly, I'm not a fan; it smells like a generic, strong cologne to me without any obvious notes. Also, the bottle is so weird it doesn't play nicely with my current collection.

The bottle is basically new if anyone wants to take it off my hands (for a price)."
70520,best major to study in college,"Well, last summer I worked full time at my city archives, for one. That's a government job, too, since libraries and archives are government run where I am (and both libraries and archives love to have historians). Historians are often regularly employed in museums. There are also many non-history jobs that value historians due to the skills that a history degree gives you - research, critical thinking, data analysis, etc. - but if you're looking specifically at history jobs, then libraries, archives, and museums ought to be your first thought.

I almost ended up working at a local museum this summer too, but instead have been working for my thesis supervisors on campus (which gives me much more flexibility as it's rather independent)."

55619,best action and adventure novel series,"Eona and Eon are big books, but they are AMAZING. They might seem slightly childish but the imagery throughout the whole book kept me enraptured. I loved them. Sadly there's only two."

65353,best phone service company,"When I lived in North Garland (near Richardson and the toll road) my Verizon was so bad I was able to get out of my contract for free. Everyone and their brother has “ma’ bell” aka AT&T because it felt almost impossible to drop call. I loved my AT&T service and speed (hated customer service)

Verizon is better now than ten years ago when I left them but if you don’t have AT&T in the metroplex you’re either loyal or trying to save money."

62105,Best RPG game on PS4,Really wanted this game but even now apparently it's still unplayable on playstation. Pathfinder kingmaker is a great game despite a crash here and there. Load screens are almost nonexistent on the ps5. It's like dos2 and bg2 had a bastard child. Story is OK but combat and optional tb/rtwp elements are well done for console

63281,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Just remember what devs always say, just because it's faster doesn't mean it's better, I'm not saying this is the case, but sometimes it's faster because of shortcuts that shouldn't happen.

I think Zebra is the best one besides Cydia of course, there's a lot of very good and talented devs working together on it."
65146,best phone service company,"That was definitely not my experience. This  was back in ...2007, 2008?"
15440,best tree for the garden,"There's one behind the main building at my school that turns PERFECTLY yellow when fall hits. I mean, all this wonderful shade of bright sunshiney yellow, all (seemingly) at the same time, no random spots of unturned leaves or different colors. It's awesome."
55276,best places to hike in the east coast,"Depends on how flexible your definition of ""city"" is. If you accept 20-50k then:

Burlington, VT

Manchester, NH

Augusta, ME

Concord, NH

Portland, ME

Charlottesville, VA

Asheville, NC

Boston, MA (honestly pretty close to mountains, rivers, lakes, and the oceans but the tourist traffic surge in the summer is absurd).

Brunswick, ME

Bangor, ME

Honestly it depends on city size and what you like to do. You want mountains and ocean? Just mountains? Lakes? Forests? Etc."
