52737,best hiphop album,"Great album for sure but, All Eyez had such a bigger impact for me. It took over my entire high school and owned two years of hip hop for me. 

That just made me feel old."
24952,best spiderman actor,"""Gasp."""
23750,best car racing video game,"Raceroom for the physics, sound and car selection and Wreckfest for fun banger races"
17185,best iOS game,"**Sky: Children of Light** 

Sky is a masterpiece. It's a sort of MMO-lite but can very much just be played as a single player experience. That said you will undoubtable run into other players and have some organic experiences from those interactions. Aside from its social elements the core gameplay is about the movement and exploration. Apple actually help fund the development of Sky and it started as an iOS exclusive.

**Dragon Quest 8**

Dragon Quest games are like the comfort food RPGs. I love the wholesome tone to the characters and righting. The Akira Toriyama art style gives the series an identity that separates it from the generic anime look of most JRPGs today. The gameplay is traditional random turn-based battles but the optional auto-battle feature keeps them from becoming exhausting in-between boss battles. I'm in it for the progression of building your party up with new skills and gear and then the amazing story.

**Super Mario Run**

My go to mobile game for quick play sessions. It really captures the Mario experience well and I love replaying levels to try and collect all five of the pink, purple or black coins. It adds a puzzle like element to the game and forces you to master the platforming. Aside from the main World Tour mode, Toad Rally and Remix 10 modes are a lot of fun too.

**Fire Emblem Heroes**

This is a F2P gacha game but Nintendo is very fair with their F2P games. You can play as much as you want for free and they constantly give you free summons and the ability to earn the orbs to summon new heroes via gameplay. Heroes is a great mix of single player and PVP modes that capture the authentic Fire Emblem gameplay. It's a ridiculously deep game from a meta and character building perspective so be prepared to do some research if you get into it.

**GWENT**

Gwent is one of those simple to learn, hard to master type of games. As card games go it seems very basic at first but as you get better cards and begin to understand the different popular deck you see just how deep it really is. Be prepared to put some money into this one if you want to get a decent deck quickly."
47412,best state to visit in the United States,"Santa Barbara is also really pretty, and personally I prefer sequoia over Yosemite because there's less tourist. And Coronado island and visiting hotel del Coronado is a must if you're in San Diego, so is visiting the San Diego zoo. If your ever in Miami make the trip down to key west. It's an amazing island, one of these days I'm going to move out of Cali and move to key west."
72633,best wireless lightweight mouse,"I bough mine for 70€. Had been one week in use so not bad price at all. It is made for gaming no doubt, but it does not yell GAMING GAMING GAMING with RGB nonsense and thinks like that IMO."
53573,best medicine for a cold,"In studies, phenylepherine is less effective than a placebo. No idea why it is allowed to be sold and marketed as a decongestant."
45089,best items under $100,sure it's reddit anything can happen...but really? this out of all the possible things to exist?
69838,best major to study in college,"Would you call that (•_•) / ( •_•)>⌐■-■ / (⌐■_■)

Bedrock?"
10414,best suitcase lock,That video was hilarious
7030,best iPhone,"Who cares what idiots say?  I use an XR and get all my shit done all day with battery life to spare.  Text is readable and smooth.  If I had an OLED screen, I would STILL use my phone to get shit done, not ""play on"".  People say they ""can't live"" without OLED.  I go between my iPad Pro 10.5 with 120 hz screen and incredible color, and my 60hz iPhone XR and you know how much my days suffers? Exactly zero.

Anyone who thinks they ""can't go back"" to LCD is a goddamn snowflake.  If your phone is not a tool for you, your phoning wrong.

I'm not some gamer kid on a bus.  I use it to navigate to jobs, provide internet to my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro, and listen to podcasts and the other regular phone stuff like communicating and scheduling etc

People are idiots.  Any next gen phone these days is a hair split from the previous."
37207,best amusement park,Florida is BGT so SeaWorld is included
8533,best toothpaste,That's why it's stupid to ask it in this subreddit.  /r/askscience would be much better (and it's probably been answered before)
1254,best ice cream flavor,Neapolitan - favourite three all in one :)
73562,best battery bank,"It works, but just slower compared to a power bank that supports USB PD."
44552,best items under $100,"I joke I have a black thumb. There's a 100% chance any plant in my care dies.   

I flat out told my mom this. She insisted I care for her plants. I requested very specific instructions. She did not give or write any down. She told me just to water them once a week. I followed said instructions. Her plants were withering and on the brink of death when she came back. I felt bad and didn't have the money at the time to replace them for her.     

Edit to add: thanks for the advice about plants. I really don't want one and am too lazy. But it's still kind of all of you to mention ones I could have and tips."
27956,best breakfast foods,Oreo Soup! A shitton of oreos in a big ass bowl of milk. Fuck with it.
65421,best phone service company,"Teltik is an excellent option. I chose to exclude them from the video because they are more for businesses. Not everyone will have a business ID, and as someone else mentioned they aren't an option for non-US residents. I felt Ultra Mobile's $40 unlimited plan was a good alternative, so I mentioned them. 

But you're absolutely right, Teltik is a great option, especially with their higher data priority. They probably deserved a shoutout at the very least. I'll be sure to mention them in my dedicated ""best unlimited plans"" video."
4341,best text editor,I like Ultraedit.
72350,best keyboard switches,"Give some box blacks a try.  Nice and cheap, they've been restemmed, and the first linear switch I've liked and you seem to like the lighter and medium weightings. I thought reds were ok, yellows were a bit much, Goldilocks was the blacks."
28383,best breakfast foods,"I'm with you almost all the way. 
I eat my half cup oats with just water though. 
The first time it seems like something is missing, kind of like when you make the switch from sugar and creamer loaded coffee to straight black. 
Trust me though when I say it that a pure cup of straight oats will grow on you."
41077,best instrument to play,"Guitar, if only for the sheer volume of resources you can find online.  That makes it an easier journey for sure."
11777,best gifts for dad,Fool me once shame on you. Fool me 17 times and I may have developed a fetish
