17185,"**Sky: Children of Light** 

Sky is a masterpiece. It's a sort of MMO-lite but can very much just be played as a single player experience. That said you will undoubtable run into other players and have some organic experiences from those interactions. Aside from its social elements the core gameplay is about the movement and exploration. Apple actually help fund the development of Sky and it started as an iOS exclusive.

**Dragon Quest 8**

Dragon Quest games are like the comfort food RPGs. I love the wholesome tone to the characters and righting. The Akira Toriyama art style gives the series an identity that separates it from the generic anime look of most JRPGs today. The gameplay is traditional random turn-based battles but the optional auto-battle feature keeps them from becoming exhausting in-between boss battles. I'm in it for the progression of building your party up with new skills and gear and then the amazing story.

**Super Mario Run**

My go to mobile game for quick play sessions. It really captures the Mario experience well and I love replaying levels to try and collect all five of the pink, purple or black coins. It adds a puzzle like element to the game and forces you to master the platforming. Aside from the main World Tour mode, Toad Rally and Remix 10 modes are a lot of fun too.

**Fire Emblem Heroes**

This is a F2P gacha game but Nintendo is very fair with their F2P games. You can play as much as you want for free and they constantly give you free summons and the ability to earn the orbs to summon new heroes via gameplay. Heroes is a great mix of single player and PVP modes that capture the authentic Fire Emblem gameplay. It's a ridiculously deep game from a meta and character building perspective so be prepared to do some research if you get into it.

**GWENT**

Gwent is one of those simple to learn, hard to master type of games. As card games go it seems very basic at first but as you get better cards and begin to understand the different popular deck you see just how deep it really is. Be prepared to put some money into this one if you want to get a decent deck quickly.",best iOS game
47412,"Santa Barbara is also really pretty, and personally I prefer sequoia over Yosemite because there's less tourist. And Coronado island and visiting hotel del Coronado is a must if you're in San Diego, so is visiting the San Diego zoo. If your ever in Miami make the trip down to key west. It's an amazing island, one of these days I'm going to move out of Cali and move to key west.",best state to visit in the United States

7030,"Who cares what idiots say?  I use an XR and get all my shit done all day with battery life to spare.  Text is readable and smooth.  If I had an OLED screen, I would STILL use my phone to get shit done, not ""play on"".  People say they ""can't live"" without OLED.  I go between my iPad Pro 10.5 with 120 hz screen and incredible color, and my 60hz iPhone XR and you know how much my days suffers? Exactly zero.

Anyone who thinks they ""can't go back"" to LCD is a goddamn snowflake.  If your phone is not a tool for you, your phoning wrong.

I'm not some gamer kid on a bus.  I use it to navigate to jobs, provide internet to my iPad Pro and MacBook Pro, and listen to podcasts and the other regular phone stuff like communicating and scheduling etc

44552,"I joke I have a black thumb. There's a 100% chance any plant in my care dies.   

I flat out told my mom this. She insisted I care for her plants. I requested very specific instructions. She did not give or write any down. She told me just to water them once a week. I followed said instructions. Her plants were withering and on the brink of death when she came back. I felt bad and didn't have the money at the time to replace them for her.     

Edit to add: thanks for the advice about plants. I really don't want one and am too lazy. But it's still kind of all of you to mention ones I could have and tips.",best items under $100

65421,"Teltik is an excellent option. I chose to exclude them from the video because they are more for businesses. Not everyone will have a business ID, and as someone else mentioned they aren't an option for non-US residents. I felt Ultra Mobile's $40 unlimited plan was a good alternative, so I mentioned them. 

But you're absolutely right, Teltik is a great option, especially with their higher data priority. They probably deserved a shoutout at the very least. I'll be sure to mention them in my dedicated ""best unlimited plans"" video.",best phone service company
