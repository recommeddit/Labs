11070,best backpack for college,"I used to use an Everlane snap backpack, but I recently picked up two bags. One is a Tumi Luke Roll Top Bag, and the other was the Aer duffel pack. The Aer one is a combo gym and school bag and has compartments for everything (like I can fit a pair of shoes, gym clothes, laptop, notebooks, waterbottles, etc. at the same time), and the Tumi one is my everyday school bag. Tumi also has a great warranty policy for their bag, if you're concerned about wearing it out. Personally, I recommend the Aer bag. It's fucking dope, and has insane storage space."

18910,best YouTube video,"Just in case anybody wants to know, the title and the video are a German pun. ""Mischbrot"" is a type of bread made from mixed grains (it literally means 'mix-bread').

Also, in German, 'mixing' and 'shuffling' is the same word. So 'Mischbrot' can mean 'bread made from mixed grains' or 'shuffle-bread'."

1899,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,I tried middle child a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised. I'll second Bettina but it's really expensive. lucky penny is pretty solid as well. Mizza also makes a pretty decent pizza. Being from Chicago the selection is definitely lacking overall.
39385,best web browser,"Firefox. I've been using it since it was still called Mozilla and I don't see a reason to switch to something else. I also use Vivaldi sometimes. At work I use Firefox for work stuff and Vivaldi for personal stuff, at home I use Firefox primarily and Vivaldi for whenever I need a second browser for some reason.

Sometimes I use Chrome for translating pages."

27048,best board games,"I just played it for the first time last night.  It's good, but probably won't crack my personal top 10.  We'll see though, definitely need to play it a couple more times to see how it is once I have it down better.  My wife did terribly though (I won 65 to -16), so hopefully she puts it together better the second time and enjoys it or I won't play it past a second time any time soon anyway.  It is the most ""euro"" game I've ever played."

54500,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"With the mice it's subject to hand size and grip style. I'm 17.5x10cm with relaxed claw. If I was to order them...

Xm1r, GPX SL, M42, Hati S, Pulsefire Haste, Viper Mini.

Truthfully those are a lot closer than just ordering them shows. For instance, M42 and hati s are likely equal.

Pulsefire is phenomenal, like one of the best mice for the price I've seen as is viper mini. They just both are slightly off my hand shape/grip style enough to put them a little behind, but not by far."
