69365,best major to study in college,"Majored in chemistry, got my masters in atmospheric science.  Have had a good career as a consultant but in retrospect, I wish my undergrad had been chem eng as my provincial govt is trying to declare me unqualified to do my own job (which I have been doing for over 15 years).  Otherwise wouldn't change a thing though, and I'll still be able to do my job, I'll just be getting our 2-years of experience engineer to sign off on my reports....."
3090,best webcamera,"Ookla claims US fixed broadband averages 200/70 these days, and I just want to ask them who in the fuck they’re measuring that from. Like, only fiber really offers uploads above even 20mbps, but if fiber is so prevalent to offset cable and DSL uploads, why is download only 200…

Anyway no videoconferencing really tries using more than 2mbps. Which is more than enough for talking heads at 1080p"

25710,best cricket teams of all time,"Top 6 is Hayden, Langer, Bradman, Smith, Ponting, S Waugh.  Others might have the likes of Ponsford, Warner or Trumper open.  Or Keith Miller or Allan Border over Waugh.  But Ponting is a nailed on starter somewhere in that middle order and any Australian will say the same."

29862,best money managing app,Budget Touch is a one time charge app.  If you can get it for android I suggest checking it out.  Easy to use and edit as you go.  I record my expenditures almost daily.  You can easily plan and  track your cash purchases since it uses the envelope budget method.

30651,best Mexican war to study,">I may be mistaken, but I was of the impression that these were mostly old wooden deck ships, and the modern ships were out to sea at the time.

They had wooden decks, but that didnt mean the decks werent armored. All the Battleships at Pearl Harbor had between 3.5 and 5 inches of deck armor. Though it should be noted that the American battleships used and ""[all or nothing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_nothing_\(armor\))"" scheme so a place that wasnt vital to either the ability of the ship to shoot back or float would not be armored. So the bow or stern probably werent heavily armored, if at all. 

Anyway, while the Battleships werent exactly new, the US hadnt produced a battleship since 1921, so as far as the battleships go, they were the best that the US had to offer. It wasnt until the [North Carolina Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_class_battleship#North_Carolina), the 1st of which was laid down in 1937, that the US had a modern battleship. 

Really the most modern capital ships the Navy had at that point were the [Yorktown Class Carriers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorktown_class_aircraft_carrier). Some of the Enterprise's aircraft actually participated in the fight at pearl harbor. On the other hand, the Yorktown was not even deployed in the Pacific at the time, the Lexington was ferrying aircraft to Midway, and the Saratoga was in San Francisco harbor just off spending some time in dry dock."

4985,best home improvement store,"Those two companies seem to treat their employees really well and pay better than most.  Trader Joe's has minuscule turnover rates....to work in a grocery store.  I know someone that left a decent career to go work for one with eyes on management in the future.  I don't know about CFA, but a local chain, In&Out  Burger has a similar thing with employees.  Pay them above normal, good/great benefits, and they can pick and choose who they hire."
