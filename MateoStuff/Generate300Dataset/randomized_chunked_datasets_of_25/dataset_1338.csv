7361,best laptop for general use,"Hi, although it isn't on my list, the [**Lenovo ThinkBook 15 Gen 2**](https://lenovo.vzew.net/BX24O0) is a suitable option. I'd go with the $909.35 configuration. You get a 4-core i5-1135G7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS display. It should be fine for those uses, plus it has an SD card slot."

449,best terminal file manager reddit,"I started writing `nnn` because personally I found ranger's changing/shifting panes very confusing. The other compelling reason was it was running very slow on my Raspberry Pi. `nnn` performs extremely well both on the Pi and Termux.


`nnn` also has the `du` and `navigate-as-you-type` modes.

> i read your Readme on github

Then you must have read the stats in https://github.com/jarun/nnn#performance. Did you notice the difference in resident memory usage?

> ranger works well with vim and mutt.

`nnn` works great on any DE. That's the goal - not to sacrifice the comfort of the DE and having the convenience of the terminal.

> but ranger is not as loud as nnn

I don't know about that but seeing your consistently negative/outright irrelevant replies on almost every thread in this post one would mistake your level of loudness as _trolling_. Probably you love ranger (and I am not competing, the goals are different) but so far I didn't read a single technical reason from you why you have to decry `nnn`."
32377,best hotel to live in,"I worked with a lot of wrestlers over the years and it was funny how the legit mainstream famous ones like Roddy Piper, Hulk Hogan, Sting, Undertaker, Macho Man and Rock were the most kind, patient, humble and genuinely nice people.
