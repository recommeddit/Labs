`nnn` also has the `du` and `navigate-as-you-type` modes.

> i read your Readme on github

Then you must have read the stats in https://github.com/jarun/nnn#performance. Did you notice the difference in resident memory usage?

> ranger works well with vim and mutt.

`nnn` works great on any DE. That's the goal - not to sacrifice the comfort of the DE and having the convenience of the terminal.

> but ranger is not as loud as nnn

I don't know about that but seeing your consistently negative/outright irrelevant replies on almost every thread in this post one would mistake your level of loudness as _trolling_. Probably you love ranger (and I am not competing, the goals are different) but so far I didn't read a single technical reason from you why you have to decry `nnn`.",best terminal file manager reddit
