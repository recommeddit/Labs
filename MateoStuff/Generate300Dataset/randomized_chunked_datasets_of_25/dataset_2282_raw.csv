As it becomes more commonplace it'll become less serious
"As a homeowner, and also a contractor, Home Depot. I find myself constantly frustrated at Lowes because they always seem to be out of stock on very basic, very common items (mostly electrical and plumbing fittings), and their online inventory is hit or miss.

Ace/True Value can be good for oddball fasteners and hardware, but their prices are usually significantly higher on most items.

A supply house or lumber yard can be the best bet depending on what you're doing. Higher quality materials and generally knowledgeable employees at a slightly higher cost."
This is the beginning of the bacon egg and cheese sandwich
"Fight Club.

I ain't gonna talk about it, though."
"my dad is on a budget of £700 but want a laptop round this range, from UK for general use, my dad wants a bigger inch screen than 14 since he does stocks, would be handy with disc drive, but doesn’t really matter he said. i am struggling to find one what are your options (could you send a couple he’s picky)"
"I second Sherrilyn Kenyon! I am currently rereading the whole dark hunter series right now (need to go faster, I'm only on Zarek's book), and then will hit up The League again."
"Yeah, doesn't Finland consistently have the best public school system in the world, yet ranked 8 in education?"
"Happy to see Lost Odyssey up there, I loved that game. Wish they would make a sequel."
"I'm guessing someone either saw and disliked what I said in another comment and is going through my other ones or has a personal vendetta against KJ Charles? Who knows, my dude."
"Try Kingkiller Chronicle.  Its a trilogy, only two are out right now.  I recently finished them.  I have to say that they are two of the most well-written books I've ever read.  I wholeheartedly suggest them to anyone.  Patrick Rothfuss is an excellent author.

The books are:  The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear.

There is a subreddit, [/r/kingkillerchronicle](http://www.reddit.com/r/kingkillerchronicle), I don't suggest you go there til you read them, though.

Yakuza series - super entertaining and a bajillion hours long.
"I was just at tjmaxx and picked up Tru Fragrace Element Edition Pearl. I couldn't find it on fragrantica, it was $19.99 at TJX and $24 on Amazon for 3.4 oz. It's such a lovely second skin scent. Most second skin scents on me are too warm and ambery but this one is more neutral and fresh, it still has a coziness but is overall such a 'you but better' perfume. I found a blog that describes it as ""This particular scent ‘Pearl’ is inspired by its calming effects, which will leave you feeling relaxed in this chaotic world. Just like a unique gem, the notes Peach, Rosewater, and Skin Musk won’t go unnoticed.

Top Notes: Peach, Osmathus

Mid Notes: Orchid, Honeysuckle

Base Notes: Skin Musk, Tonka Bean"""
">Yeah I would suggest using Firefox though. Brave still promotes the Chromium monoculture and their ad policy is parasitic, hurting small creators, in my opinion. Tbh it is a bit mafia like. Good reskin though

Disagree, quite the opposite actually. The ad design gives a larger revenue share back to small creators than Google AdSense.  That's why so many small YouTube creators have signed up for Brave (135,000 of them)."
That's what I get for skimming through the section headers only. Thx.
Just finished speaker and xenocide. Good stuff
"I will be a dental student in a few months and have spent hundreds of hours shadowing. What I have learned is..
1. Toothpaste that is ""whitening"" is actually worse for you than normal toothpaste because it contains abrasive material that is actually destroying stained enamel.
2. Studies are showing that mouthwash may not be as beneficial as once thought because it increases the pH in the mouth, therefore promoting bacterial growth."
"I demand a traditional interface, and Firefox has it (after you restore the title and menu bars). Can't stand Chrome's weird design."

"The most highly respected are the Guardian, Independent, Times, Financial Times and Telegraph. I believe the Guardian topped a recent academic study of journalistic transparency in English language publications.

In the digital media the BBC News is up there with the others.

For breaking new scandals, Private Eye (a magazine with no online edition) has a phenomenal track record."
Eros or Dylan Blue  - preference?
"I got a good medical pillow two month ago but it cost more than $100.

Best pillow ever, I wouldn't take a penny back.

Edit: But I'm sure there are some pretty good pillows for less than $100"
"An 18xx game in the top 3?

My bro. Chesapeake got my whole group into 18xx, and 18xx.games just fanned that flame."
I do it wrong. I almost drown when I use it.
