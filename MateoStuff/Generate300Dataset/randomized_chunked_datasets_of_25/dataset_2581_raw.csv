I don’t like him as a person but the super hype 6ix9ine songs work great
"YNAB legacy 

Pros: easy to understand for me
Cons: can't connect to my banks"
Mimosa Hostilis
I heard he was linked with lazio and Tottenham. Hopefully he gets a a move to Europe
So I guess that person just really wanted me to watch monster then?
"This. People shit on tequila, but if you get a nice one it's heavenly. Cheap tequila is going to taste like shit."
">Roar, Superman

ANGERY"
"There seems to be a few dentists here so I would like to present a question.  

My dentist suggested to me that toothpaste makes little difference.  The manual action of the bristles is what dislodges plaque and tartar.  Toothpaste is there for breathfreshening and contributes very little to actual cleaning.  Moreover he stated that flossing is much much more important.

Is there any merit in this?"
My rep Steve Cohen seems decent
"It depends where you are. There are only 3 providers on the west coast, TMobile (bought sprint), Verizon, and ATT. I believe all other brands are MVNOs.

"One could always LEAVE the resort to experience some culture. It's not like you're stuck on a ship or anything. I'll admit that you're not putting yourself in the most optimal position to experience culture, but that certainly doesn't mean it can't be done and that you're going to be ""disappointed"".

But to add to the comment, I find resorts are more well-suited to relatively large group, say 8+ (?)."
"Angel Heart

Planet of the Apes (1968) - as long as you've been living in a cave for 50 years and don't look at the DVD cover before watching."
"I know he said ""HE does his every scenes laying down"" when asked how he feels working with tall heroines like DP. Dont know about actresses laying down tho."
"So I’ve commented this before on a post a while back, but I actually know the guy who made that video. He was in my creative writing class in college and, when we would read our stories aloud to the class, his would make everyone cry laughing. I remember one that he wrote about his grandparents catching he and his girlfriend having sex on a kitchen table that killed me. I reached out to him recently to see if he’s still writing creatively and he told me he hadn’t in a while, so I hope he keeps making these videos/decides to start writing again. I’m legitimately pretty sure he’s a comedic genius."
Both great cities but the hipster problem in Seattle has really gotten out of control. The last time I was home I was blown away...like a cockroach infestation wearing grandpa's old plaid pants.
"I had good luck with Pur + Target refills. Under-sink is better, but not an option for many apartment dwellers"
"My take is pretty subjective but I couldn't get the hang of ppas. I think they're all over the place and I can't really wrap my head on how they work. In contrast with arch based distros, I understand that most of the packages not included in the community repo is available in the aur. If ever I need something, I'll just go there, clone the package that I need, and build it on my system. It's also quite easier for me to track packages outside of the community repo with pacman.

From what I recall, I only broke something when I upgraded my kernel. But yeah, Ubuntu and other related distros are more stable compared to even the most stable arch based distro which is Manjaro. If you have an old laptop, maybe you could install manjaro there and just mess around with pacman until you get comfortable with it. And even if you don't like pacman, there are also software managers in manjaro iirc"
So it doesn't. Differentiating between Chromium which is forked by Ungoogle Chromium ([a self-built Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium)) and the [official Chromium downloads](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) is important here.
"I'm from Vietnam. I bet if you've heard of the popular Vietnamese dish ""pho"". For those who haven't tried it, pho is a bowl of hearty noodle soup with slices of cured beef or chicken. 
Well, we eat that for breakfast in Vietnam. Now I live in America, and it's ridiculously hard to find a pho place that opens for breakfast. America ruined pho for me."
"Jansport has a lifetime warrenty, as long as you pay shipping."
Dark City! Classic. Way too underrated
