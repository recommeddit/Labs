"Where I live we have the 3rd option of Menards. It was around for decades before the other 2 and is still a great big box store. It's main difference is all bulk/large items are kept in the yard. So you pay for it and drive your vehicle back to load it up. This has 2 benefits. 1) you handle your items only once (not including unloading at your destination of course) 2) you can actually pay for items and pick them up when ever. I bought 70 bundles of shingles, 4 rolls of felt and some nails last weekend and l haven't picked them up yet and won't until it's time to do my roof. 

Plus where I live they are all within 3 blocks of each other. Kind of cool to have so many choices."
"The Big Three use a lot of palm oil in their chocolate these days.  Not just cheap and gross, but bad for the environment.

My sister and I have tried our best to make our house ""the cool house"" for around 20 years now.  We used to give a mix of Legend and Trusty level goods, but now we bounce around different styles based on how creative we want to get and what our finances are like that year.  Whatever it takes to not give money to the Big Three.

(Especially Nestle.  Fuck Nestle.)"

"I dated a country singer who would drink pony jugs of Jack and OJ. Vodka makes sense, Jack and OJ might be manlier but just seems nasty."

"Honey butter. 

It’s basically vanilla ice cream with peanut butter and honey mixed in. It’s so delish. My local ice cream shop always changes their flavors either every week or every month."
Now that's just adorable.

"The lumber yard here has such a nice selection of stuff, and the guys in the yard are always nice, and they offer to cut the 16's in half for me, which I don't need them to do but it's thoughtful.  The ones in the office are 50% awesome, helpful, give good advice, and 50% so rude without good reason, I'm probably going to only go there for stock nobody else carries."
I heard he gets more box than the Memphis FedEx hub.
"I don't like eggs, so I have hash browns, bacon, and sliced avocado with sprinkled with salt, pepper, and hot sauce (Pepper Plant duh)."

No Community? It's in Canada I think.
Battery barely started to fade? Must have been lucky. I had my SE for 3 years aswell and in the end it would barely last me for the day. But now after switching to the SE 2 I realize how much I liked the SE.
For me personally it is my current XR. It's just such a solid phone in every way that I care enough to notice.

"The Mandarin Oriental in Malaysia. Everything is so fancy, the rooms are gorgeous, they have a lovely spa and outdoor infinity pool. The staff are all super professional and tidy the rooms immaculately. The best thing was the food though, they had a huge buffet breakfast every morning. I'm used to a buffet table but this was a buffet room!"
