36237,best alcoholic drink,"It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach, that something like 85% of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian 'chinanto/mnigs' which is ordinary water served at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan 'tzjin-anthony-ks' which kill cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds.	
What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs."
60284,best freezer brand,"$200 is a good starting point because of the recent story of a $30 one used

Avantco has ones for $199-299 from webstaurantstore, and apparently it's commercial. I can't attest to whether it's good or not though"
64744,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Santa Barbara urchin really is amazing. I recommend that you go to the [harbor/marina](https://www.yelp.com/biz/santa-barbara-harbor-santa-barbara) early Saturday morning, around 8am. There are a few fisherman who sell in the morning, and there usually is a guy with a cooler full of live urchins. If I recall correctly it'll be around $12 / ea. Bring cash. You can probably pay the [fish market](https://www.yelp.com/biz/santa-barbara-fish-market-santa-barbara) close by to break it open for you if you don't know how. Or bring a metal spoon and knife and watch a YouTube tutorial.

I'm not a fan of [Arigato](https://www.yelp.com/biz/arigato-sushi-santa-barbara) - fish is decent quality, but the price is high for what it is. It is relatively good for Santa Barbara, but to be honest a random Manhattan sushi place that delivers to your apartment would probably give you similar quality. If you want to spend a bit more for a unique experience + excellent fish I recommend [Yoichi's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/yoichis-santa-barbara). As a warning, it is more on the fine dining side of things, so I'm not sure if you would want to go solo. 

~~[Ia Fish Market](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ia-fish-market-and-cafe-santa-barbara?osq=ias+fish) is a fish market with oysters / poke within the Santa Barbara public market. Its a pretty chill place to get oysters, and you can check out the other stores / people watch after.~~ Think of this place as the smaller Santa Barbara equivalent of Chelsea Market. I was here a few weeks ago, but yelp says that it is closed. Hopefully not, though. If it is I'm sure you can find some other great happy hour oyster recommendations from other people in this thread.


Go to happy hour at the [Boathouse](https://www.yelp.com/biz/boathouse-at-hendrys-beach-santa-barbara) for some clams, chowder fries, and a beer at a decent price. This is right along a dog beach, so you can enjoy the sunset while seeing some cute dogs run around. If you miss happy hour your food will definitely be on the expensive side, but I believe it runs a bit later than most, to 6pm.



For bar food, I'm a fan of [Llama Dog / The Nook](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-nook-santa-barbara). Good burgers, and nice beer selection. Expect to spend around $15 for food.  This is in the Funk Zone, which means there are plenty of trendy wine bars to check out after you eat. 


I think Santa Barbara has excellent budget food. [Lily's tacos](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lillys-tacos-santa-barbara-2?osq=lily%27s+tacos) is amazing. I'm a big fan of the lengua (tongue) tacos. Prices of all the tacos are the same, at a low price that you would never find the city. 


If you haven't eaten [In N Out](https://www.yelp.com/biz/in-n-out-burger-goleta) definitely hit that up. In my opinion it is one of the best price / flavor ratio you can find anywhere.


Lastly, as somebody who lived in NYC for a few years, I will tell you straight up that most ""New American"" type places in this city will likely not impress you. Not to say that they are all bad, but I just want to make sure you set your expectations accordingly. 


I hope you have a great time in Santa Barbara! It really is a special city, and you'll definitely find something tasty to eat."

58821,best cologne,"Like everyone else here said, it's more of a personal choice. However for everyday I wear a not as strong cologne. My every day cologne is Black by Kenneith Cole. It's not really strong but I only use like two or three sprays and have gotten many compliments over it. For dates I use something that'll last the whole date and a bit stronger. My personal choice is the 212 for Men. Only two sprays with that one but it's amazing. 

Here's a link to both colognes.

62191,Best RPG game on PS4,">Good story, fantastic world, worst combat this gen.

I love this game, but I can't really disagree with the people who complain about the combat.  Even if the combat was strictly vanilla it wold be better than some of the mechanics they introduced.  I made an alchemy build, and it's frustrating as hell to micromanage all of your oils.  How hard would it have been to have the oils that you've unlocked to automatically apply to Geralt's swords against the relevant monsters/npcs he was fighting?"

47812,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"The TI-84 Plus is the standard graphing calculator recommended/required by most US universities and it’s permitted on the AP, ACT, and SAT exams (among others). Some school districts are switching to Desmos.com because it is available online for free and it is becoming allowed, and even embedded, on some standardized exams, but the TI-84 Plus is still the standard.

As others have stated, many texts are written with the belief that you have a TI-84 Plus calculator. What many people don’t realize is that this isn’t by accident. In fact, it is why TI has a near monopoly on the high end calculator market. TI offered free courses for educators to learn how to use their calculators and paid publishers to include instructions on how to complete mathematical problems using their calculators in math textbooks. As time passed, educators (teachers) knew how to instruct students on how to complete the task in TI calculators, but not other brands. To simplify and standardize the teaching process, schools started requiring TI calculators. It was just easier to use what the teachers already knew and not have to spend time teaching students how to use several different calculators. Now TI has a practical monopoly on the calculator market for secondary and post-secondary education.

Desmos, and to a lesser degree, GeoGebra, are making in-roads on TI’s monopoly by offering free, powerful, open-source online calculators and Pearson, one of the largest textbook publishers in the US, has begun to include instructions on using Desmos in their texts."
