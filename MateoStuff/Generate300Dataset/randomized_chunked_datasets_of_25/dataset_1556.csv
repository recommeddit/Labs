24526,"1. Madoka Magica- As some are aware, I vomited watching it. That was unexpected, but the show completely sucked me in, and the characters had me completely captivated.

2. Steins;Gate- This one hooked from the start, and was nothing short of a thrill ride from beginning to end. Even the slower stretches have an excellent feeling of tension that I loved.

3. Usagi Drop- So many happy tears were shed. Everything about it feels so real, and I love how Rin and Daikichi grow together throughout the show.

4. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood- The show does a great job balancing the action, adventure, comedy and drama, with a great cast of characters.

5. Rakugo- Some of the most engaging characters I've ever seen. It's a show that really brings forth a great sense of passion, and really knows when to pull at the heart strings.",best anime

43428,"With ""pay per download"" I was aiming at a monetization strategy which guaranteed the publisher a small revenue for every install of his/her app. It was in my experience a pretty lucrative model in the past, but, of course, unfortunately based on kinda intrusive ads (like creating an icon on the home screen after launching the app (with the option to opt-out)).

Those intrusive ads were forbidden by Google pretty soon after I started using it and every ad network I know has stopped such a revenue model. However, those cpv ads you've mentioned kinda seem to be comparable to it. Is this also category one would see user-revenue based (unity) video ads in (so the revenue is generated with every ad impression rather than every conversation/click)? Or am I confusing something? Does this revenue model exist with ad formats other than video ads with a minimum viewing duration (which are exactly those unity video ads as far as I know)? Like the common interstitial/banner ads?",best ad service for mobile applications
47891,I did a similar pink for my kids nursery a few years ago but the focal wall with the crib in from of it was a dark grey. It looked incredible with the white crib in front of it and it wasn't too overpowering like I think an all grey room would've been.,best color to paint with

I want to be a part of their lives but they just shut me out. For mother's day I'd just like them to open up to me a little and spend some time with me.
