24526,best anime,"1. Madoka Magica- As some are aware, I vomited watching it. That was unexpected, but the show completely sucked me in, and the characters had me completely captivated.

2. Steins;Gate- This one hooked from the start, and was nothing short of a thrill ride from beginning to end. Even the slower stretches have an excellent feeling of tension that I loved.

3. Usagi Drop- So many happy tears were shed. Everything about it feels so real, and I love how Rin and Daikichi grow together throughout the show.

4. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood- The show does a great job balancing the action, adventure, comedy and drama, with a great cast of characters.

5. Rakugo- Some of the most engaging characters I've ever seen. It's a show that really brings forth a great sense of passion, and really knows when to pull at the heart strings."
40313,best midrange CPU,"12600k, hands down. Nothing comes close at it's price. If you ask why, look at the reviews."
72838,best Linux distro,"They are all different linux distributions, you can run (nearly) every Linux distribution alongside windows.

[Here are the FAQ from /r/linux](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/faq)"
61587,Best RPG game on PS4,I'd give all the money for an Origins remaster. God I loved(most) of that game.
6719,best iPhone,"Absolutely. I think the SE might be a little too small for me, but I would definitely give that a try."
43428,best ad service for mobile applications,"With ""pay per download"" I was aiming at a monetization strategy which guaranteed the publisher a small revenue for every install of his/her app. It was in my experience a pretty lucrative model in the past, but, of course, unfortunately based on kinda intrusive ads (like creating an icon on the home screen after launching the app (with the option to opt-out)).

Those intrusive ads were forbidden by Google pretty soon after I started using it and every ad network I know has stopped such a revenue model. However, those cpv ads you've mentioned kinda seem to be comparable to it. Is this also category one would see user-revenue based (unity) video ads in (so the revenue is generated with every ad impression rather than every conversation/click)? Or am I confusing something? Does this revenue model exist with ad formats other than video ads with a minimum viewing duration (which are exactly those unity video ads as far as I know)? Like the common interstitial/banner ads?"
47891,best color to paint with,I did a similar pink for my kids nursery a few years ago but the focal wall with the crib in from of it was a dark grey. It looked incredible with the white crib in front of it and it wasn't too overpowering like I think an all grey room would've been.
71371,best movies with a cool twist,"Spider-Verse. The reveal of Prowler along with his theme pumping in the background was awesome. 

Before the nerds say everyone should know who Prowler is, no, we don't all read the comics. It was one hell of a reveal."

38686,best newspapers to read,"Indeed, until the 'i' launched, I bought the Sun purely as a distraction for the 10 minutes bus ride to work, you can read the Sun without having to actually believe anything, and the letters page is often hilarious."
15542,best tree for the garden,Thanks for the answer. I will check these out.
26863,best board games,"Oh odd, what appears off to you?"
12582,best gifts for mom,"> You both like the Facebook and listen to the same talking music with the African American gentlemen.

This is sweet =)"
12814,best gifts for mom,"Just spend some time with me. It tears me up that my kids don't think of me as a friend and barely even talk to me. My son just comes home from school and goes straight to his room, my daughter comes home from school and barely talks to me and just sits there texting. I want to be a part of their lives but they just shut me out. For mother's day I'd just like them to open up to me a little and spend some time with me. I don't know if it's because I'm a horrible parent or what, I don't know what went wrong."
58021,best cologne,"This is the one. A friend got it for me because she likes when guys smell good.

I thought she was saying I smelled meh. Now I’m thinking...

God damn it."
59561,best perfume,"Okay, for sure a man, I'd guess in his 30s, probably have a big beard, you do at least one stereotypically masculine thing like working on cars, lifting weights, woodworking, something like that. You used to care a lot about what people thought when you were younger but have since trained yourself out of it and generally don't give a shit what people think of you unless they're someone close."
38543,best newspapers to read,"I still like having a physical copy in my hands, even if it's just out of habit more than anything. Same thing for books. I love e-books but lots of times it's more comfortable to lay in bed with a book rather than stare at a screen. Nostalgiacore."
12067,best gifts for dad,"Alright there, Dwight."
51711,best iphone case,"Same, but I have two kids."
23522,best car racing video game,"Its possible my memories arent accurate, I played it as a kid. But for some reason I do remember that the upgrades were meaningful and you could have easier time if you made your car faster. Especially in drag races"
