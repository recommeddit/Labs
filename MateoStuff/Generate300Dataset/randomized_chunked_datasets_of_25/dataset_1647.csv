10911,"How big is your laptop? I have the regular sized one and an 11"" Chromebook and the Chromebook fits snugly, so if your laptop is any bigger I'd suggest the 15"" laptop one! There's a little laptop pocket in all of them (the ""laptop"" specific ones just have a padded pocket instead) and that's where I put mine. The rest of the backpack is super roomy, I normally carry both a food and water hydroflask, a notebook, and a book and still have room to spare.",best backpack for college

Need it to be small and light, will mostly be using it on my lap while sitting on the couch, screen no bigger than 13.5 inches with 12"" being optimal.

Price range is $600 - $750.",best laptop for general use

50447,"When the original post speaks of RATM's production, it refers to the way the album was mixed and mastered. In hip hop, when people talk about production, they're usually referring to the beats and the instrumental aspects of an album. The mixing and mastering are both different things.

So all the people in this thread answering with MBDTF might be right it's the best produced hip hop album due to its great beats and instrumentation, but that doesn't mean it's well-produced in the same sense as RATM's debut. I know a lot of people criticize MBDTF for having been mixed sort of messily.",best rap album
29085,"I use [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190), but now that it has become a subscription app, I would probably choose [Calendars](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calendars-planner-reminders/id608834326) instead since it's still a low one time payment (for now).

For the default calendar app, you probably see the month calendar on top with a list of that day's events underneath. The top menu should show < Oct 2020 with the icon next to it selected (rectangle with lines under it). If that's what it looks like for you, all you need to do is tap ""Today"" at the bottom left of the screen. You should now see a scrollable list view.  If you didn't already have today's date selected, you'll have to tap Today once to go to today, then tap it again for the list. It's only 1 tap if you were already on today.

You'll notice the top has changed from < Oct 2020 to just < October, and the icon next to it is now just lines (events) without the rectangle (calendar) above it.  Tapping the lines brings you to day view with an hourly breakdown. Tapping < October brings you back to the previous screen with the calendar month and single day's events under it.",best calendar tool

When it comes to *Is This It* by the Strokes I like it because it's just a really fun, happy album. I didn't like it for a long time because of how overrated it is, but once I accepted that there is nothing profound or that unique about the album then I enjoyed it a lot more.",best rap album

25296,"Andrew Garfield was the most accurate live action Spider-Man. He had the looks of 616 Peter, a long with the wit and personality to play both Peter and Spider-Man. Its a shame he got dealt such a shitty hand. Cause I would've loved to see him trade quips with Downey's Stark and the rest of the MCU

Tobey was awkward and too soft spoken, leaving for some really jarring scenes. And he certainly was never convincing as Spider-Man at all.

Tom kinda feels like he's channeling both Tobey's and Andrew's versions together sometimes. But I hate how they characterize him as Stark's sidekick. And his Spider-Man comes off as incompetent. He isn't really funny either. Its more like funny stuff happens to him or around him. Again going back to his Spidey being incompetent. I also don't see Peter Parker when I look at him.",best spiderman actor
