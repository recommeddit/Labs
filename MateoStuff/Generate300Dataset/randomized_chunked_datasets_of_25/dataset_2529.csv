67742,"I had to fight to get IE10 support dropped at mine. Dropping IE11 was not an option since too many customers rely on it for ActiveX and enterprise features either not supported by Edge or the client's IT not willing to deal with learning and forcing everyone onto Edge.

Sadly, our bundled JS could be a fair bit smaller by getting rid of all of the transpiled syntax (i.e. leaving arrow functions in place, classes, etc) but it'll be years before that can happen.",axios alternatives reddit

10983,"At the various price points I would say:

Jansport,  fjallraven, topodesigns, goruck/missionworkshop

I'll throw TripleAughtDesign in there with Topo. Their ""scout"" pack has all the benifits of a small tactical pack while looking decidedly civilian and less like ""that guy that talks way too much about guns"".... I've been using their lightspeed for about 5 years. It's a bit more tacticool unfortunately (I have the molle-free tail on it so it's not so bad), but it was my school bag, and is now my dayhike bag, work bag, carryon, weighted ruck for working out, etc. still looks like new.... 10/10 would buy again.",best backpack for college
16117,"Aren’t those knockoff sunglasses even worse for your eyes than not wearing sunglasses at all? Read an article about that recently.. your pupils dilate because it’s “darker”, but they aren’t polarized so they’re taking in direct sun. 

If your goal is to look cool and like you own Raybans, I’m sure they’re fine. But if protecting your eyes is of any priority wearing sunglasses, you shouldn’t wear these. 

Edit: as others have pointed out, it’s that they aren’t 100% UV protection, not that they aren’t polarized. I didn’t remember the article correctly.",best sunglasses for fashion
