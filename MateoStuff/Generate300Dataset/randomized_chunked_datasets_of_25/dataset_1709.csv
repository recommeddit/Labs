49516,"Monitors for general use don’t have an emphasis on input lag, colours, response times or anything. They are for things like web browsing. Cheap and it just works,

Gaming monitors have emphasis on input lag. They generally come in 120hz+ refresh rate to make experience as smooth as possible. Colours are good  and repose times are low.  In this category there are 3 sub groups, TN, VA, IPS. If you’d like to know more, reply.

There are other monitors like professional editing ones that are 4k and have 10bit HDR to edit things, these have low input lag and response times as these things aren’t difficult to implement and the monitor is already expensive, adding a little more manufacturing processes isn’t a problem.",best gaming monitor

So far it's been 40+/week. I'm sure it will slow down once the major stuff is done.

I think that if you are committed you can make it work. But maybe I just got lucky, I don't know. Being a young, innocent looking white kid probably helps on freelance sites. I think for the good jobs it gives me an advantage.",best programming language for web development
26332,"I'm not so sure, we're basing the expectations of current voters and their general understanding of technology and social media with the voters of the future. Much in the same way as politicians try to seem normal, the guy you would want to have a beer with, past drunken facebook pics or stupid retweets might just show voters that the candidate is normal. Young people who manufacture a social media personality for future political gain would be the kind of psychopath I would run a mile from, who's to say future voters - who will have spent their whole life with social media - won't feel the same?",best politician

It was cold and all the tourists were gone and I spent 3 days building huge sand castles on the beach quietly with one, tiny tool as my younger siblings fought endlessly over all the buckets and shovels.  Then at night we'd barbecue and I'd read quietly and sleep in this giant bed and listen to the ocean.",best state to visit in the United States

It's not a requirement to have a sonically diverse album to sound good.  Some of the greatest albums in any genre weren't sonically diverse that doesn't take away from it sounding great. You wanted him to mix in a P-Funk sample like everybody else does.  You are some snarky wannabe who doesn't know shit about hip hop or music for that matter.

24590,"1. Rainbow -excellent show about the creation of a frendship in a harsh environment

2. Made in Abyss - pure adventure and great world building

3. Now and then, here and there - fantastic coming of age show 

4. Gurren Lagann - the fights get so intense it's crazy, and it still makes you care about the characters

5. Monogatari series - The style, story telling, writing and I like the whole idea of the show

6. School Live - Horror, yet makes you smile and laugh. But becomes very serious as well

7. Arakawa under the bridge - Shaft style comedy. The people living under the bridge seem so awesome I would live with them if they were real

8. Shinsekai Yori - Amazing world, the main reason why I liked it is a spoiler

9. New Game - Fun, happy show about cute girls making video games. And I love videogames lol

10. Kino no Tabi (2003) - physolophical show about a girl and her bike seeing the world and experience all that it has to offer, the good and the bad.

I need to reformat as I would like to add Sora Yori from this season into the list, and maybe Girl's Last Tour and Anohana now that I think about it. Also really liked Tsuki ga Kirie (most likely spelled wrong)",best anime

53852,"Cold preventive: As soon as I feel the first tell-tale symptoms (itchy throat, hurts way back where the nose and mouth passages meet) I start gargling morning and night with a 50/50 mix of hydrogen peroxide 2% solution and Listerine Classic (the burny kind). Not a lot of the mix, usually enough for three or four long gargles way back in my throat.

The stuff that comes out can be pretty grody, so I guess that's where the whole thing starts. I've been lucky to nip four or five colds this way since October.",best medicine for a cold
