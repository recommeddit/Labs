Probably fairly feminine, you like to look good, not in a conceited way but just in a it boosts your confidence way, probably some kind of professional with a stressful career. And I'd guess, without knowing half of those and just based off the names, that you like sweet florals.

Mine would be (in no particular order other than what comes to mind)

1) Vilhelm Poets of Berlin

2) Micallef 20th Anniversary

3) Creed Aventus

7001,"I disagree. While OLED on my Xs Max looks pretty darn good, the black smearing is there, and, for me it has been increasingly annoying. At first it was the Apple Watch app, and now it’s the whole OS with Dark Mode.

I know you can deactivate Dark Mode but that kinda defeats the purpose of OLED. At first I thought it was a bug with my specific unit but can’t unsee that smearing anymore, going as far as having thoughts about switching to an LCD iPhone when this one retires, but that telephoto would have me on the fence.

37073,"Knoebel's

EDIT: I should elaborate....  Knoebel's is an amazing park with an experience that you will not get anywhere else.  There are also 2 world class wooden coasters that aren't to be missed *(my non-enthusiast sisters were having a discussion about coasters and the one said that wooden just weren't her thing even though she'll ride them and the other one who had been to knoebel's told her that she would absolutely change her mind after riding those two)* as well as the flying turns which is a neat experience and a fun little steel coaster.  This is also a park that you could stop and spend a few hours at or spend a whole day at and enjoy yourself either way.

My personal opinion on Busch Gardens isn't horrible but when I went a few years ago solely as a coaster/ride enthusiast I really wasn't impressed.  I've found it to be the most expensive in terms of admission, food, merchandise and didn't rise to my expectations.  There isn't a bad ride there and it is a beautiful park but for someone who is/was focused on rides I felt like I was paying for a lot of stuff that I could have easily done without.  There are 2 new coasters since I've been there so maybe that helps and, aside from that, I also want to stress that this isn't saying it's a horrible park because it isn't but it doesn't rate high on my list simply because of what I'm looking for.  I'm far happier stopping at King's Dominion, paying less, and getting a lot more rides.",best amusement park

61826,"Depends, how much did you like playing through A?  There's a lot to get through if you want to go back and get all the main endings, one of which requires replaying the majority of the game again.  

If you liked playing through Route A, I'd say go for it because C is substantially better.  If you didn't like it, I wouldn't bother though.  I forced myself to push through to ending E just because of all the acclaim (C/D/E all come very close to each other, it's really just 3 playthroughs) and liked almost nothing about the game by the end.  If the story and gameplay aren't at least moderately interesting to you by the end of A, I feel like nothing will really change.  

It's probably not a bad idea to wait a while before jumping back into it, because Route B is a LOT of the same content as A.  It may feel pretty grindy to jump right back in.",Best RPG game on PS4

Our tower had a private pool/bar area with a water slide down to a lower level of it. Then there is a series of  massive pools at the ground level right next to its private beach. I am sure, no matter where you stay though, it will be an amazing honeymoon.",best vacation resort
