Just listen to the natty anthem on repeat. Ultimate gym playlist.
"First off, there are 3 types of online degree programs:

1) For profit, DeVry, University of Phoenix, Art Institute of Yo Mamma, etc.

Not sure if your school falls into one?  See the words: ""For-Profit"" and ""Nationally Accredited"".  Nationally Accreditation is the same accreditation used for all schools that advertise on Judge Judy.  
The only times these are useful is when you are in a dumb organization that needs a check mark in the degree column for you to move ahead.  Think government mainly.  

2) Online, respectable universities.  These are universities that are solely online or distance, but are respected.  Western University's and University of Maryland University College (UMUC) are the only two that come to mind.  
These are respected, but the rich alumni base and career centers are not available.

3) Online portions of brick and mortar universities.  Many schools are using this.  Colorado State, a bunch of Cal-States.  Most of them offer the same degree as on-site.
These are respected as well, some as much as the real university, some not so much (think Harvard Extension School).

And there are a bunch of extension and certificate programs that are pure money-making schemes for real universities.  If your workplace will pay for it, consider it free training.  But the certificates, unless highly technical or geared towards a specific skillset, are laughable if you put them on a resume.  

These programs are great for nontraditional students who may be mid-career or training for a specific job (e.g. teaching).  These are not good for students who have no skills and just want a degree and think jobs will flock towards them.

And, with the exception of the for profit scams like DeVry - what you put in correlates to what you get out.  You can enroll and put in no effort and pay someone from India to do all the coursework, and you will get a useless degree that furthers nothing."

You mean nothing like ITA or IME in Brazil?
I have an upcoming paper and good relevant articles can be very time consuming to find. Thanks :)

"I'm not entirely clear on the specifics when it comes to American politics but when was the last time a president was elected that wasn't considered 'wealthy'? 

Also, how common is it for an average Joe to be elected to congress? Is it even possible these days?"

"I would just put that on the manufacturing (process) of the 5c. Outside of the old school Blackberries, the most durable (and best feeling) phone that I've ever used was the Nokia Lumia 1520. That things has been dropped so many times from different heights and the only thing it has to show for it is a few scuffs here and there. I wish Apple would use the same manufacturing process that Nokia used for the 1520. One could wish"

"I have a sonicare, but I hate it, electric brushes tickle the shit out of me and I'm always in tears by the time I'm done."
"Heck yes, Hendley is absolutely worth a sniff. His stuff is top notch, and his iris and rhu khus are to die for. 

Solstice Scents is awesome; their sampler set is worth the $$$. They have a lot of earthy, naturalistic scents. Can definitely help you narrow down the options if you're thinking of getting samples :)

Fleurs de Citronniers is like a creamy lemon soap. There's a sort of sweetness, not a candy sweetness, which makes me think of Meyer lemons. And the musk is super sexy... it reminds me of the musk in Muscs Khoublai Khan, without all the vanilla and spices. It can be temperamental though... sometimes the musk adds the perfect animalic counterbalance to the soapiness, sometimes it veers a bit into the fecal territory. I find it's better on skin than clothing."
i’ve heard them and either both pairs i heard i heard were broken or something or they just sound terrible (i’m thinking the second one because most people agree they’re bad) i’m surprised that review says something positive about them
"I REALLY wanted to add Bayonetta, the only reason I chose not to add bayonetta is because the original game is included with Bayonetta 2 on Wii U.

But as a cheaper option, it might make sense to add it to the list.  I want to so bad...I think I have to."
"Current daily games are:

-	Flow
-	Flow bridges
-	Flow sudoku
-	Flow crossword
-	AFK arena
-	Good sudoku
-	Melvor idle

>	I basically just do the daily puzzles or logins. And while not a game, I also have my daily Anki cards I do. 

Some classics I occasionally come back to:

-	Game dev story (really any Kairosoft game but especially this one)
-	Plants vs zombies
-	Bloons 5 and 6
-	Kingdom rush series
-	Mini motor racing"
"Sublime is the best overall. It's basically anti-fuck up.

Notepad++ is free and you can set it up to work better than sublime. You may also find yourself needing to add some other things (non-official plugins) to make it do stuff it can't do.

Visual Studio is also aaaight."

Thank you for compiling this list! I watched and loved Cowboy Bebop and have been watching and loving Attack on Titan and have been watching youtube rankings to see what i might like next. Started Demon Slayer and do like that along with Death Note. Couldn't stick with Full Metal Alchemist but am going to try FMA Brotherhood. So many more to try from you list.

I freaking love that movie. The score was amazing.
"Thank you so much! I will check those out. For games, I am hoping to play Tabletop Simulator a couple times a month (and probably the new Spyro games!), but otherwise I mostly need a laptop for coding in Python and general school work. I was looking at the Asus Zenbook 14 or Lenovo Flex 5 (both AMD Ryzen 5 4500U), but wasn’t sure how they compare or if you would recommend them."
