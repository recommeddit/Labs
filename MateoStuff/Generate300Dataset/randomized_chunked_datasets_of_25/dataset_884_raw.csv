The cheap kind.
I have Anker power lines that are still as good as day 1 and I bought them 3 years ago. Also picked up the Anker nano charger and it works great. I have no desire to buy a different brand.

Whhhoooaahhhh"
"Agreed. The space is cavernous, they should do something to the interior to make it appear a little smaller/cozier. But the food is delicious, which is why I keep coming back."
VA is still the closest thing to perfect though
This guy gets it - sweet combo
"Worth every star, and the prices were quite reasonable for lunch!"
"I've never read a romance book, but I did see a book by Fabio at a library once. It was called The Pirate. I turned to a random page and read a bit. The abysmal writing (think slow fifth grader) and clumsy dialogue was worth a good laugh. Also some weird rapey vibes that really made the experience a surreal one."
"Lowes.

Because it's closer to my house, which makes it nice when I need to make like 4 trips in one day.

I've also had really good experiences with customer service at my local Lowe's."
I love all of the Elizabeth and James perfumes (except for the Rose one)!
*SHIA SURPRISE*
"Racing: CSR2, Asphalt 9, Assoluto Racing, FR Legends, Torque Drift, Forza Street. 

Others: NBA Jam, Mini Metro, OK Golf. 

Can't remember other games, but I have a ton."
"Depending on climate, peaches do fairly well and can be rather prolific. Disease resistant apple varieties can be good producers. Pears are ok. Citrus fruits won't reliably produce north of something like zone 8 or 9. 

Figs are another choice. Though they must ripen on the tree. They don't continue to ripen after being picked. Dates if you are in a desert type climate."
"It isn't.

I was out of high school long before I ever learned there *was* a Mexican American war."
"I already put my list up, but thinking about it again, I'd have to add **Lord of Light**. It's just incredible.

I know that it was used as the fake movie they were going to make told in Ben Affleck's 'Argo', but I would love to see this as an actual movie."
I LOVE my recipe for buttered popcorn ice cream. It's delicious when topped with a salted caramel sauce. Mmm.
i still use a version I bought back in 1998.  Works for me.  Column mode is fantastic as is the macro when editing large data files etc
Not my proudest fap

"Hyatt has some really nice properties, especially the Park Hyatts. Most Hilton's are pretty basic, but the Waldorfs and Conrads are nice. Starwood also has some great properties. Fairmont has some REALLY nice properties but there aren't very many of them."
"Totally agree with you about Outlander. It's not just romance, it's like relationship porn."
"The concept of a university system is a bit foreign. Here the entirety of the country's universities bar four or five are all in the same system, organised by a central body but independently ran. In that sense the system would be ALL UK universities, including Imperial, Oxford, UCL, LSE etc.

The term ""public"" has a slightly different meaning here too. The government regulate the universities and their fees etc., but the universities aren't part of the government's assets and the lecturers are private workers.

It moved soooo slow.
