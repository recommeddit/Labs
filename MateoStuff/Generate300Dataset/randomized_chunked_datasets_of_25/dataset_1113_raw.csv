Dude derailed such a promising career with Carlos Danger.  He was going to be the anointed successor of the Clintons.
Same! When this album is farther down than Kid Cudi on terms of production... Y'all opinions is skewed
"Animation.

EDIT: Thanks to all that replied! I can't keep up with all of them. But I'm going to read every last one! Thanks a ton :)"
"Bought a 12 year old house with a Glacial Bay faucet. Stopped working and went to Home Depot to get a new one. Manager ended up crediting the full amount of the old faucet on the spot if I promised to bring the original in.

Faucet was likely 5+ years old at that point and he knew I didn’t even buy it originally, but he said they stand by their products. Best customer service experience I’ve ever had and I shop there exclusively now."
Any bill burr is fantastic.
"The first three seasons are some of the funniest, best written and acted comedy ever put to screen.

Season 4 was disappointing and a gigantic drop in quality. I watched it twice and even though there are the odd good moments, it all feels contrived which the first three seasons never did.

I've only managed to get half-way through season 5 before giving up."
"Major: Advertising/Public Relations

Best: Fun classes, small class sizes (it’s a limited access major at my school), lots of internship opportunities in my city related to my major

Worst: Low pay in both fields unless I work my ass off (and even that won’t guarantee anything), and people telling me I’m in a “fake” major lol"
The notes in Daisy Dream sound appealing. Will have to sample.
"I disagree but like many other comments here I just want to point out that the Tomatometer is not a score, it’s a percentage of how many critics liked a film vs critics who didn’t"
If you like Inception and Memento then you have to see The Prestige.
Those don't even reach my bag. They go straight from the stranger's hands to my mouth.
"Grizzly Man, Meru"
"Move yo ass, go berserk"
"Have tested many kde distro, but no one has given me the stability I was looking for. All kde distros had some kind of serious error. Have used linux for over 20 years. My conclusion is clear, Manjaro xfce I landed on. Their kde distro, on the other hand, was a mess that most kde desktop I have each gone in. KDE was a more stable desktop environment at the time, like the gnome 2 series. mate has never been able to take over the gnome 2 series that should never have been phased out."
"Make sure you get the right one, there’s been an explosion of copy cats with similar names.

"*Steve*:  Here's your dog back.

*You*: Wow!  Steve Austin?  Holy shit, thank you!  *reaches for hand shake*

*Steve*: *Proceeds to apply Stone Cold Stunner*  I... I'm sorry.  I'm still working on the hand shake thing.  Enjoy your dog.  Bye."
"You shouldn't leave dogs and small children alone together. Ever. That's how accidents happen. Eg. Dog has ear infection you aren't aware of, kid comes over as normal to normally happy friendly put up with anything dog, child ignores warning growl and thinks dog is 'smiling' with teeth. Child pulls on ear. Child bitten - possibly on the face. Child left with scar and a fear of dogs, dog put down, entire family upset.

A cat would be a much better option in your circumstances but **no** animal should be brought in to be a plaything for your child. That's what toys are for :)"
I loved Beach Read and Get a Life Chloe Brown too!
This. Deluxe Edition all the way.
"Thank you
I'll have to check this out.

Saved!

Thx again"

"I can't really can't choose a greatest album but there were a couple good ones so far. 

Yelawolf went on an insane run early this year. 5 projects of which 4 were damn good. Especially Mudmouth and Mile Zero are still in heavy rotation for me. Funnily enough the worst album I've listened to this year was probably also in there (Turquoise Tornado). Just not my sound

Other artists with solid or very good albums were: slowthai, J. Cole, Nyck Caution, Kota the Friend, the Mello Music Group tape, DMX, Conway the Machine, Kenny Mason, Ghetts Brockhampton, Lloyd Banks, Smoke DZA

Lloyd Banks might become one of my favorites over time. Definitely a very good project on first listen"
"Chemical engineer here - been working for a little over a year. The pay is good, but in the majority of ChemE jobs, they work you like a dog for it. I have friends that went into oil and gas and work 12+ hour days for weeks on end at drilling sites and hate their lives. I went into manufacturing and work probably 60 hours a week, but it is very taxing on the mind and body. Due to the massive amount of time I spend working, my weeknights and weekends are spent catching up on sleep or trying to squeeze in a few minutes to pursue a hobby. That is not living. 


tl;dr - money isn't everything.  
  
Edit: this may sound like I hate my life/job. I don't. I really enjoy my work. I've never been much for going out and partying, etc. so I do fine without it."
Paris Hilton made you a sandwich? That's going to be hard to top.
"2204.62 lbs in a tonne.

1000 kgs in a tonne.

How does that makes sense?"
