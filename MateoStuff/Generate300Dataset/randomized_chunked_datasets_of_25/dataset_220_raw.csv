Insanity wolf says you assume wrong
Basically this Grange was an extremely famous college player and him coming to the NFL gave pro football a ton of credibility.

I majored in accounting and actually if I could go back I'd consider a technical school instead. Accounting is boring.
This is a solid list. Remove Ubuntu and I think thatall of these distros are amazing in their own way.
Look down the streets nearby and see.
"Hey, my country has some of the cleanest tap water in the world, so I don't even need to buy any kind of water."
"Well the one my sister had seemed to be, because that little shit chirped all fucking night. She put him in my room because of that amd the smell. I ended up caring fot the little noisy shit until he was rehomed."
"Thank you bro, I got this Nascent album on repeat for hours since you posted"
"Yeah, the second movie does it super well too, the only problem is you know to top the original they have to have a crazy twist so you expect it, the beauty in the first movie is that if you watch it with no knowledge or expectation of what happens, it makes it the ultimate twist. 
Spoilers:
another thing I think that makes it so good is the fact the it comes out of no where, there is no indication of it at all throughout the movie unless you watch it super carefully. For instance when it cuts to the hospital and the cancer patient is the guy in the floor, but the viewer can't know that because of the bloodied face of the guy on the floor.

So yeah, the others do it well but the first is definitely the best."
The office (us) probs one of the best out the first season is shit but the rest are amazing. Brooklyn 99 is good aswell
Question regarding Titos. My boyfriend argues that Titos is the crappy vodka people get for college house parties that no one actually likes...I keep arguing that he's mixing up Titos with something else cause Titos is respected  as far as I know! Even his friends agree with him (they're all in college) so I just wanna know what if I'm the wrong one here haha. I love Titos and visited it's distillery in Austin but I'm no expert by any means regarding alcohol.

"You donâ€™t have to be a psychologist if you get a psych degree! For perspective, thereâ€™s people who go into medical school and other non-psych related clinical work with a psych degree. You donâ€™t have to be a councilor either. Always feel free to change your major, but please know itâ€™s not a one path career. If history is your calling, itâ€™s not too late to switch!"
"The ravpower Batteries have passthrough charging if thatâ€™s something you care about.  I personally do.  Allows me to plug in my power bank and use it as a splitter to charge everything I own at the same time as charging the battery itself.  

The anker powerbanks explicitly do not do this.  Youâ€™re either charging the bank or the devices connected to it but not both simultaneously.  Supposedly this helps with the long term health of the power bank but I donâ€™t really care about having it in pristine condition 5 years from now.  

Iâ€™m also going to suggest the OmniCharge 20c+ since thatâ€™s the one I actually use.  The downside is that itâ€™s hella expensive (~$199.  Got mine on sale for $165.) compared to everything else BUT it has two power delivery enabled USBC ports and also supports passthrough charging.  I can charge my MacBook (and two more devices) at the same time as the power bank is charging and thatâ€™s awesome."
BETTER THAN YO MOMMAS GLASSES (or something to that effect haven't watched in a while)
I always thought amp tasted like melted jello.  Its weird but awesome.
"Fetch is dirt simple to use. Xhr wasn't all that bad.

I've never understood why people need jQuery or Angular (yes, I've seen people include Angular just to use $http) or Axios or anything else to make http requests."
"Ok I missed it but you have so many. Lol. 

Reason I like so well is you get all the extras...HD video, hotspot, rollover, VVM, Canada/Mexico, etc...  About the only thing not included is 5G.  Also, by getting discounted pins my renewal price was only $258 or $21.15 per month ðŸ˜†"
"That explains why I actually really liked jokers jinx this year. With the mid course break run limited or off, the second half is actually enjoyable.

As for superman, I wouldn't say it was brand new, but it was much more improved on from the last couple years. I think the only rough patch was there at the end before the bunny hills.

Roar gets worse each year, and I've decided I'm not riding it again until they do something to it."
