"Good point. Perhaps reserve it? Fairly sure that's possible, not sure how long for though."
"> Thor Ragnarok

The best marvel movie. Change my mind. 

Best sci fi adventure movie since the 5th element."
That book left such a lasting impression on me. It will always be one of my favorites.ðŸ’–
Polo Black is amazing!  I buy it for my husband.
Laughs in super metroid
The most perfect season I've ever seen. Not a mediocre minute in the whole season
Nobody cares.
What is it that you really want to do?
"Yeah, incredible screenplay."
No I have never bought paperlike. Wayyyy too expensive for what the function is. I bought the 2 pack iCarez for half the price and I still have the original one I put on 4 months ago. Still looks brand new and I usually wipe it down lightly once a week for hand oils.
Wireless would be great
Was your knowledge on colonial influences how you got in? Or else how did you make that transition?
Student debt is pretty punishing.
"Full English. Bacon, sausages, eggs, black pudding, hash browns, mushrooms and toast. Couldn't eat it everyday - but for a special treat it's incredible."
It's all good I love Hulu but we don't get a hip sub for it
This sub shares a lot of tastes with the varies puppy things?that seems surprising as there was a thread asking for Conservative Sci-fi recommendations and the response was basically you can't have conservative sci-fi (even though whenever a magic realism or more fantasy work is touted people point out the sub is actually speculative fiction)

What's in the box???!!
"Trumpet, Alto/Tenor Sax, and Flute. Jazz flute is sexy as fuck! (reference: Anchorman bar scene!)"
I always see people crap on Magic Mountain for not having much besides their coasters but I never see that complaint about Cedar Point. SFMM could definitely use more but Cedar Point has some even bigger gaps (like a dark ride) but no one ever talks about that.
Speaker for the Dead over Enderâ€™s Game?  I read both long ago in high school but Enderâ€™s Game had the impact on me for being the start of the series.  I liked the series in general but my memories vague.  Liked the philosophical nature of them even though the plot advancement was painfully slow for my high school mind.  The Enderâ€™s Shadow branch of the series appears largely silly to me now despite being more action packed.  Think that branch got more silly with each subsequent book.
Oh did you now?
Whatâ€™s the best way to get Sileo right now? I had it before but updated my uncover and lost it. And how do you get Zebra. Itâ€™s fine if you donâ€™t want o explain I can google it tomorrow lol
"best: pretty much anything with caramel, skittles, or starburst."
