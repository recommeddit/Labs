"To add to this, make sure you get up north. Shasta, lassen, Humboldt, the trinity alps. Northern California has mind boggling natural beauty without the crowds. There's a whole half of the state north of SF that people forget about.

ETA: Yosemite is otherworldly and absolutely worth going to, just try to hit it during the week and ideally not during summer vacation."
"Interesting, ok there is work. But in my country ( italy ), I don't know how to get prospects. Do you cold call companies ? I tryed cold email, cold call and direct mail. But nothing worked."

"I’m currently dealing with a loose iPhone 7 charging port that can still hold a charge, but there’s no “click” when inserting an Apple lightning cable, or a third party lightning.  When using a dongle while running, the dongle slips out & constantly pauses the music in my earbuds.  I found out at the apple store yesterday that some third party lightning cables can do some damage to your pins; I may have been guilty of this over the years with my phone.  They also said that they can’t replace the port.  I currently am doing the electrical tape method inside the port (YouTube).  

Any recommendations of legitimate cables for my next iPhone, besides apple’s cables?  Please & thank you!"

My dentist said nothing matter as long as you brush twice a day and mouthwash; with a manual brush.
I have a tile for my phone and keys- attaching one to the dog is BRILLIANT
"Dired. 

Because it is included with Emacs :). Just kidding. Because it is completely keyboard driven."

"Awesome, thank you for explaining it to me."
"I wonder why shoe companies don't do something obvious like put a ""-C"" or a ""-S"" after their shoe names?  For instance, Vazee-C.  Now you immediately know it's a cushion shoe.  

Maybe that's too obvious or something.  I don't work in marketing."
POINT TO BE NOTED.
Recommend you go.  Has one of the best wooden coasters in the world.

"Cleaning your bathroom fixtures with diluted bleach solution is plenty, but you aren't killing everything, even if you use bleach and hydrogen peroxide. Diluted bleach will kill e coli, staph, salmonella, norovirus, basically all the potty viruses and bacteria you would expect to encounter if you licked a dirty toilet (probably don't lick a dirty toilet). Well, all the ones you can reach, anyway. 


But you don't need to worry about killing *everything* because you and your family are safely ensconced in a body. Keep the bathroom mostly clean, wash your hands with soap and hot water, and you'll be fine. If you're feeling neurotic, close the toilet lid before you flush. Seriously, why don't people do that? Thats why there is a lid.  


Not having children will probably go a long way in keeping your face uncontaminated, too. Kids are pretty gross."
