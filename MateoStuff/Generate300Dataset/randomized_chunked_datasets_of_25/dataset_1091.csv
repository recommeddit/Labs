And I totally get most peopleâ€™s dislike of MCU in general, Iâ€™m just in the bag for these so paying $20 to watch Thor make a hammer and RDJ be covered in a CGI suit is a fun time for me. Totally get itâ€™s not everyoneâ€™s thing.",best Marvel movie

36012,"nobody's said it yet but this is a low-calorie way to get extremely drunk:

Picklebacks.   Ok, bear with me. 

Take a shot of bourbon (say, jim beam or something even cheaper) and chase it with a shot of pickle juice.  Vinegar or salt pickles, not sweet ones.  Pickles and pickle juice contain next-to-no calories, and straight whiskey is about as low-cal as it's possible to get while still consuming booze. 

Sounds gross, (and I didn't believe this either, at first) but the pickle juice really neutralizes the bourbon taste/feel.  It washes your whole situation clean, readying you for another shot.  Protip: 3 at a time or fewer!

If you really hate both of those things, it won't work, but if you can tolerate pickles you should find it delightful.",best alcoholic drink
71580,"Jurassic Park was amazing. People hated the sequel. People hated the third one. Then the fourth one comes out and for some reason people are surprised they didn't like it. It's like the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over expecting different results. You go to an island, dinosaurs want to kill you. That's the plot for every movie. And honestly I love the movies, I like that plot, but stop going in to those movies expecting something original or something that makes sense.",best movies with a cool twist

That said, the 12600k is a fair bit more powerful, although neither will realistically limit a 3070 for years",best midrange CPU
