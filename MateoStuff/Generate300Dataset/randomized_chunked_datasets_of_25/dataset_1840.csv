3082,"I'm using a Logitech BRIO. Excellent webcam, but can be problematic for non-Windows users if the firmware is 2.x - they improved functionality for Windows users, but killed it for other operating systems where a phantom second device appears and you get mic drop outs (firmware 2.7 introduces video drop outs too). Any BRIO on 1.x firmware works perfectly, however.

Shame really, since it's such a pricey camera and such a good picture. Oh, and Logitech don't care about the non-Windows market, so they don't allow you to downgrade the firmware either.",best webcamera

22589,"Once had the opportunity to meet Samuel L. Jackson at the golf course I worked at in TX. He is an absolute joy to be around. He tried to stay low key and not have people go out of their way for him. Just when he was leaving after I cleaned off his clubs my buddy asked if he could say ""his line"" from Snakes on a Plane. I can say that was the only time I was happy to hear someone say ""Get those motha fuckin' clubs, in my motha fuckin' car!""
