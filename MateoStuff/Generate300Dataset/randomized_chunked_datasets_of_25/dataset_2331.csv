37290,best amusement park,"They're kind of like Aldi and Lidl, KD and BGW respectively. Quantity and quality, heavily competing with one another, similar in a lot of ways, one more consciously local in taste, one more consciously cosmopolitan and appealing to the European aesthetic. KD sells a lot of camo stuff and Aldi has a lot of Live Laugh Love-style décor and stuff in the Aisle of Shame that competes directly with MLM junk. BGW is literally a fake Europe theme park and Lidl's best-selling items are the craft beer, the croissants and the escargot. Red counties, blue counties. Red park, blue park.
