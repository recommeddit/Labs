"At this point, I think it depends on where you live. I live in the rural midwest and without any meaningful infrastructure, I wouldn't consider one."

"As a Michigander it hurt a lot seeing that my state seems to have disappeared, I understand the maps is lake free, but that's a pretty significant land-mass to have been cut  off into what appears to look like a part of Canada."
Happy cake day!!
I have the 23 inch version of that and it works great
"I'd like to live in America, specifically New York. I know it's expensive, blah blah blah, but whenever I've been it felt like the very center of culture, the eye of the tornado, the heart of the matter."
"i sent conan a drink from across a restaurant once, with the message ""thanks for everything""--i didn't identify myself as the sender.  after he was done eating, he asked the waiter who sent him the drink, walked across the entire restaurant, came over to my table, and thanked me profusely.  he stayed and talked to us until his car was out front--a solid 3-5 minutes.  VERY nice."
"I agree with this, although I think basically any ordering of those three at the top is defensible"

"Best hotel in terms of luxury? Either the Four Seasons in Vegas or the Savoy in London. 

However. The best hotel for experience? The Intercontinental Hotel in New York City. 

TL;DR When I went there for New Year's as a teenager I was incredibly sick. They got me an emergency appointment with a doctor, and the next day after calling up to check on me they gave me a free plate of about 15 warm and gooey chocolate chip cookies because they were happy I was feeling better. 

I went there with my mom when I was a teenager. Our flight got in late, so we had to check in late and they were absolutely fine with that. Thing is - I looked awful. And I felt awful too. Somehow my ever so slight cold had blown up into something much worse on the short flight from Toronto to New York. 

They noticed I looked ill, and the woman at the desk asked if I was alright. My mom just said I was tired (she didn't know). We got up to the room and I collapsed on the bed. I was freezing yet sweating buckets, and I felt like a sumo wrestler was sitting on my chest. 

The front desk called up and asked again if I was okay (I guess I really did look horrible). My mom told them I wasn't feeling well and asked if there was a walk-in clinic I could go to tomorrow. The hotel ended up making us an appointment to see a doctor the next day (but had asked if we wanted a ""house call""). 

I should mention that this was for New Year's, and the next day was New Year's Eve. Getting me an appointment with a doctor on New Years eve really was going the extra mile. 

So the next night, after I was full of meds (bad case of bronchitis), they called again to ask if I was feeling better. My mom told them I was and thanked then for what they did. 

Five minutes later there was a knock in our door. She opened it, and it was a hotel worker with a tray. She told him we didn't order any food, but he walked passed her and set it beside me on the bed. He lifted the dome and under it was a plate of about 15 chocolate chip cookies. They were still hot and gooey too. He said they were happy to hear I was feeling better, so they wanted to give me a free plate of cookies. 

No hotel has ever gone that far for me since, so because of that they'll always be my favourite."
"Yeah, I had a year of C/C++ coding in highschool and while it did ease the transition a bit, I realized pretty quick that I hadn't even scratched the surface"
"TSA Pre-Check. $85 for 5 years. I have a new job where I travel about once per month.  Now I can keep my shoes on, light jacket, belt, watch ... And I don't need to take liquids out of my bag.

So fast to set up. Did an online application, and was able to schedule an appointment for a Saturday two weeks later. The appointment is called an interview, but there were no questions. It was for providing fingerprints, and showing ID. Was done in under 15 minutes, and had my Known Traveller Number by Tuesday evening.

For $11 more you can get Global Entry, but I don't travel internationally, so it wasn't a big deal."

"I have a short attention span with toothpastes, but I always have a tube of ClinPro (Rx, similar to Prevident), and I really like the Colgate Enamel Health one right now because it makes everything feel so smooth.  But I'm currently also using an herbal-flavored one called Blend-a-Med that a cousin brought me from Germany, and a hippy-dippy organic tooth powder from Purebella.
And samples in every bag.
I have too many toothpastes."

"Thanks for posting!  

I am 28y/o and I have depression and anxiety.  The meds I'm taking have happily eliminated the depression, but I still struggle with anxiety and fatigue.  

I think I am trying to change too many habits at the same time.  I have successfully implemented the habit of beginning my day with a cup of green tea for the past ~16months.  Changes I would like to make are: going to sleep at a reasonable hour, getting 7 hours of sleep, waking early, and going for a walk early (because if I delay for too long it gets unbearably hot in my area, best time to be active is before 8am.)  

I have a puzzle alarm app that helps me actually wake up and stay up, and I recently added a habit tracker app, though I find myself ignoring some of the alerts.  It's more of a virtual checklist to keep track of how well (or poorly) I do.  But it's been very difficult for me to go to sleep at a reasonable hour, throwing everything else off.  In addition, nearly every night I am tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable, and I have constant back pain.  Would a new mattress solve all of my problems?  I do need a new mattress, but I think that's too optimistic."
"Business, a lot of people may be in it but they are all hated"
Exactly. One-piece is average compared to the animes you mentioned.
It's a JRPG. If you're forced to play a pre-defined character then it isn't a strict RPG.
I was actually disappointed when I tried their tri tip plate; it was decent but I would take CST's tri tip or venison sandwich over it for sure.
I love Teddy Roosevelt just for the folklore around him and his life. And we could probably use a little more trust-busting these days...
"I'd say that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14"" or 15"" is your best bet if you can find them with the Ryzen 7 4800U, or you could wait for the Ryzen 5000 iterations of those laptops."
Yes. Trackers see a lot of issues like these
