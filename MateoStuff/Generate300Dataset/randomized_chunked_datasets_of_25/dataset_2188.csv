48999,best gaming monitor,"So this won't be seen by more than a fraction of who it is intended for, but I'd like to thank every single one of you who commented. It really helped me make my decision and I just ordered the LG monitor. Honestly it could have gone either way."
50788,best rap album,"Best album so far for me is a tie with:

Armand Hammer & The Alchemist - Haram- Two powerhouse lyricists spitting powerful bars over sublime beats from The Alchemist (that album art... wow).

Czarface and MF DOOM- Super What?- Three dominant MCs bring their A-game alongside  amazing production by 7L. The playfulness of the comic book theme combined with Eso's powerful performance and DOOM's high lyrical content level result in a fantastic album. Though the final track pulls the project down as a whole."

69561,best major to study in college,"Anything in IT probably, IT is just booming and will only get bigger"
31498,best hotel to live in,"Cisa is pretty much the standard, yes. It’s very straightforward, buy the book, take the exam, and pay annually to keep the certification plus some continued education points you need to keep. It has been many years since I renewed mine, as I’m no longer in that line of work, but it gives you a strong foot when it comes to understanding risks, controls and what ‘good’ looks like"
34475,best NFL player,Walter Payton.  Jim Brown and Barry Sanders rolled into one
32805,best free online grammar checker,"I'd recommend grammarly. It's better for insight on your writing styles than anything. Study up on AP style writing, and you'll learn the basics of grammar. It's not as complicated once you get plenty of practice in."
55688,best action and adventure novel series,Definitely this series. The Samuil Petrovich Series by Simon Morden is similar Action.

54068,best medicine for a cold,I like Tim Ferriss's list of [cold remedies](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/03/18/4-anti-cold-cocktails-that-work-from-ancient-china-to-german-alcoholics-and-modern-labs/). The ginger and orange peel remedy is the one that seems to always work for me.
65885,best college in california,"Just a note, all the UCs are considered Public Ivy except Merced I think."
58590,best cologne,"I don't recommend blind buying, but Perry Ellis 360 Red is probably one of the safest blind buys in that price range. If you like Acqua di Gio, you'll like it. Even if you don't, you still might like 360 Red."
4214,best text editor,"Its pretty nice.. Its pretty handy not having to refresh the page, Im just so used to my other options its tough to switch."
8178,best toothpaste,"From what I've been told and read, those floss sticks should be for out and about and convenience. Using them to floss regularly just kinda spreads bacteria around, unless you use a new one every few teeth."
22699,best celebrity,"King Richard the Lion Heart. He despised Britain, loved killing people and was a shit soldier who pretty much bankrupted his country by getting caught on his way home from the brutal crusades and having to be ransomed out."

28927,best breakfast foods,"Someone may have already said this, but overnight oats!
I bought a bunch of mason jars and I put in some oats, some yogurts/milk and some fruit in them, then just grab on my way out of the house."
28959,best breakfast foods,"Sounds great! I make the gravy the way I was taught (southerner here), but your technique looks sound...will have to try :) thanks! 

Oh and sometimes I add in green chile to cook with the sausage for a southwestern flair ;)"
55297,best action and adventure novel series,"I find most sci-fi, and maybe especially the works of Peter F. Hamilton to do this for me, probably because he spends so much time (and words) on worldbuilding, Just the beautifully realized worlds really lets me experience the places where adventure happens so nicely."
47772,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"I've gotten through AP Calc AB, Calc 1, Calc 2, Differential Equations, and am working through Calc 3 and Statistics with a TI-84CE. The NSpire is banned on a lot of tests in my classes due to CAS, so I know people who more or less wasted money and can't use their calculators. The TI-84 series is great and will pack enough to get you through most math classes.

However, my university also prohibits use of calculators on some tests to only a 4 function all the way through Calc 3, so you may not also use it that much."
57782,best cologne,"I wore Cooper Square by Bond No. 9 to work one day and a coworker told me that her uterus almost leapt out of her body and strangled me.

My girlfriend damn near raped me when I put on Scent of Peace for Men by the same parfumier,"
