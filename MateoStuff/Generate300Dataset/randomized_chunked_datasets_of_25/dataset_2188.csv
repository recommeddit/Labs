50788,"Best album so far for me is a tie with:

Armand Hammer & The Alchemist - Haram- Two powerhouse lyricists spitting powerful bars over sublime beats from The Alchemist (that album art... wow).

Czarface and MF DOOM- Super What?- Three dominant MCs bring their A-game alongside  amazing production by 7L. The playfulness of the comic book theme combined with Eso's powerful performance and DOOM's high lyrical content level result in a fantastic album. Though the final track pulls the project down as a whole.",best rap album
