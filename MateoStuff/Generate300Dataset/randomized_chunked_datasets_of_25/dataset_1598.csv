41595,movies like Inception,Would you say that you Joseph Gordon love him?
35432,best alcoholic drink,"A couple of my favorite cocktails to serve to other people who don’t want to taste their alcohol either (I’d rather taste my gin) are these:

3/4 oz St Germain 
1 oz of gin
Top off with champagne (usually in a sniffer glass, or something similar.) Personally I do no ice. St Germain is expensive, so I’ll only do this for like a date who comes over. 


Or just an Italian margarita. 
1 shot of each Amaretto and tequila 
1/2 oz of triple sec 
Top off with sour mix in a glass with ice. 

Personally if I’m drinking it, I do like half the sour and the rest water or soda water or even tonic. I don’t like sour mix that much though. Also this is something I make for guests, so I’ll usually get like pitcher and do a cup or two of each amaretto and tequila, do 1/4-1/2 cup of the triple sec, and pour a bunch of sour to taste (like double what I did of tequila, so 2-4 cups). Then just pour that into glasses."
23365,best car racing video game,"You don't like pc3 with a wheel? I have a thrustmaster tx. I have pc2, I know pc3 is a sin to pcars fans, but I don't care if it's not sim like pc2 was. But if it's shitty on the wheel, then I don't even want to bother."

72246,best adblocker extension,You are a good man.
55514,best action and adventure novel series,"Not personally a WoT fan, but both Tigana and Warbreaker were wonderful books.  
Brandon Sanderson is a fun read if you want magic systems that are a bit out of the ordinary, not QUITE as epic as LotR or WoT though."
60701,Best comedy show on Netflix,Jim Gaffigan’s Mr. Universe! Actually all of the ones on Netflix right now is super fun!

31408,best country to live in,Ok....?
41464,best instrument to play,"> Plus it can do anything you want-- melody, harmony, rhythm, you name it.

And it does exactly none of that as good as instruments dedicated to those specific things.

Piano is good for learning but poor for performing music."

Edit: some words"
26543,best board games,"This is somewhat true yeah. I still play Codenames, Santorini, Mars, and Sushi Go regularly. Sheriff, Telestrations, Ticket to Ride, Pandemic, and Forbidden Island generally come out with my friends/family who don’t play many board games, but they still get used! 

At the very least, it’s nice to have a set of introductory games to engage people who haven’t played anything but monopoly"
34648,best NFL player,It's just people doing something fun between seasons; basically shitposting.  You can ignore it or downvote it and move on instead of throwing shade on something other people enjoy.
