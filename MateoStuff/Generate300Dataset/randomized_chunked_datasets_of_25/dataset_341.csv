22103,best celebrity,About 12 years ago I met Gary Sinese at a screening of a documentary he produced about a family in my area who had three sons who deployed to Iraq. He's as nice and genuine has everyone says and him caring about disabled veterans is definitely not an act or for PR purposes. The guy just cares.
60843,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I wanna mention one that's never really talked about:

Hari Kondabolu. ""Warn Your Relatives"" is fucking hilarious from start to finish. 


I really dig Iliza Schlessinger. She's unconventional and more than a bit weird but I love it. 

Bo Burnham's ""Make Happy"" is incredible.

Mike Birbiglia's ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend"" is a beautiful story with a lot of laughs.

Marc Maron ""Too Real""

Aaaaanything with Patton Oswalt will be hilarious."

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love supply chain and I get to travel and do many different things which is great but I love learning about how things came to be."
