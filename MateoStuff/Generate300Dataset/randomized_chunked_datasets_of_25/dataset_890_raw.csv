"$90 for a 60g wireless mouse with optical switches and no holes sounds almost too good to be true. If the build quality isn't trash, and the wireless performance is flawless, this could be a game changer."
Hotel and meals are paid for.  I sold my car and townhouse a few years ago so I have no bills.

"I just dl’ed Persona 5; I admit I haven’t played it yet, but given the amount of extremely good reviews, the fact it has a ton of gameplay hours involved, and it’s around $15 for a couple more days, I couldn’t pass it up."
"Hi, I'd go with the Gateway 15.6"" on my list. Ryzen 5 3450U, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS display. It is $349 currently. The brand isn't well known, but it offers good specs for the price."

You can always check the active ingredients on the back of the box.  This works for comparing generic brand medications as well.
For those confused as to what a Miata is it's an MX-5 for the rest of the world.

"The answer depends on your definition of “quality.” There’s different types of bottled water (spring water, mineral water, water from aquifers, etc), and each tends to have a slightly different taste, at least to some people. This is due to the various minerals found in these broad varieties of water. There’s also certain brands that claim their water is ultra pure, or is extra filtered, whatever. Those all more or less taste like nothing, which is probably what a lot of people want from water. 

In terms of whether it really matters which one you drink, no not really. Even the waters with the highest levels of minerals don’t really have enough to make a significant health impact. As for tap water, that very much depends on where you live. Most water treatment plants here in the U.S add fluoride to the water to help with dental health, so that’s one reason to opt for tap water here. 

Ultimately it’s up to you and how much you value minerals/purity vs. cost and potential environmental damage due to the plastics involved in large scale production."
