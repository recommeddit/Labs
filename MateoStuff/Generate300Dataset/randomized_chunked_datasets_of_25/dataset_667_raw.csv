"Full on RPGs:

- Divinity Original Sin 1/2 (great DnD style RPG)

- The Witcher 3

- Dragon's Dogma (The game feels a little outdated to me but you might like it)

Action RPGs:

- Borderlands 3

- Dark Souls 1/2/3

- Nioh (Soulslike game in feudal Japan)

- Bloodborne

- The Surge (pretty good soulslike game with mech exosuits)

- Shadow Warrior 2 (Borderlands meets Doom)

Games with some RPG elements:

- Nier Automata

- God of War

- Monster Hunter World


If I had to choose 1 of each category I'd say Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3 and God of War are pretty safe bets but honestly, you can't go wrong with any of these"
One of the few movies that I've watched all the way through and immediately got up and restarted the movie from the beginning. And I still keep noticing new things when I rewatch it.
"I realize i'm 3 months late to this topic, but it is one that I have a lot of ambivalence toward:

I entered the headphone market, when generally, the reasonably best of the market was never upward of $1,000 dollars; then the HD800, PS1000, among others were kicked off, and now the hi-fi become mid-fi.

I climbed that ladder, and came back down. While I applaud Sennheiser for having a flagship that came out 5 years ago, what I really came to understand is the market starting to take advantage of consumers. It -really- bugs me that we have companies on both ends of the scale releasing new products much more often then before.

On some part, I have a bias. I don't want to buy a new headphone every year, thinking that somehow mine has become obsolete. AKG is a good example here, as they've really started to ramp up a 55x and 7xx headphone yearly. While I favored some of their more recent headphone's, I did not want to purchase a new headphone in five years, knowing the K732 had just come out.

One thing I do appreciate though from them is sticking to the same headphone design's for these basic models, because on the other end of constant releases, you do have Sennheiser, for example, putting out ghost updates on their headphone's. At the end of the day, the biggest factor that bugs me though lies within the fashion conscious of why headphone companies are releasing different styles to designs that already work.

For example, you have the M70x and MSR7 that just came out (at least to me). Yesterday I had just gotten my hands on a pair of m40x's, and to be honest, the design to me was perfect. It was understated, fit, had replaceable pads, collapsible, a detachable cable. While I hate the sound signature of the likes on the M50x, the design of it, as a closed, efficient portable, should be the likes that other developers copy and paste. And in all honesty, it baffles me that the MSR7 differentiates so much from that design. The plastic is strong enough, but why not just put more metal parts in that stock design?

I'm really getting off-topic here, because there are so many smaller nitpicks in the market.

In regards to the cheaper China headphones flooding the market now, some of them are actually outstanding. The likes of Monoprice, Focal Spirit, Sound Magic, and NAD are all headphones I love the sound of. Going back to the likes of the M50x though, the durability and comfort don't even come close. This is why I like my time tested companies, like Audio Technica, Beyerdynamic, and Sennheiser, since - for the most part - they get comfort. However, now that you Sennheiser trying to appeal to the Beats crowd, I feel like they can't design a competent portable headphone. The Urbanite and Momentum look good, but the sound signature and design do not appeal to the head well. It's like guitars, since the design of a guitar is meant (with good reason) to comply to the sound of the guitar, and not to the user holding the guitar. These headphone's do not apply with comfort. In those cases, i'll choose a speaker (even on quiet) every time.

The second part of why I stick to time-tested companies is user replaceable parts. While I don't think Sennheiser can make a competent, all encompassing closed headphone (and at the moment, i'm doubting many dynamic drivers can), there was a time I contemplated just owning Sennheiser because many of their models offer parts I can replace, instead of trusting a service, or throwing them in the trash. Beyerdynamic does this will some of their models, albeit Beyerdynamic has some glaring reliability issues. I applaud V-Moda and Koss for offering good deals for replacing of upgrading headphones.


In conclusion, for a seemingly simple closed, efficient, comfortable, competent, portable headphone, simply accomplishing the basics is unfounded. The checklist should be making the portable headphone, efficient, comfortable, and durable/replaceable, giving brownie points for a collapsible design; then one should look for applying an appealing sound signature.

Looking back at designs that have tried to capture this market: the M100 and HD 25 both are not comfortable, not with anything i've tried doing with them. The DT770 accomplishes this, no user detachable cable, and a thin sound signature. The 1540 accomplishes this with a slightly wonky and nonportable design. The options are few. The M40x/M50x accomplish this, and to me are the gold standard, despite that I hate the sound signature; they're the holy relic of good design though.

What do I take and recommend off of this? Moddable headphone's. This mostly applies to the closed and/or portable market, because I will recommend the HD600/HD650 to anyone. Personally, I am under the impression fully sealed, dynamic headphones do not work well in that setting, particularly for a neutral, interesting signature, like the HD600. I'm not going to recommend a headphone to anyone that does not have those basics mentioned above though; however, the Monoprice, the T50RP, HD25 (still uncomfortable), the M50X, have a vast arrange of options for modifying their comfort, sound signature, and durability, like their headbands. For example, it always confuses me that AT will put their protein leather headbands their, like on the ESW9 when they start to flake. What Beyer does with a velcro sealed headband, like on some T50RP mods is simple and smart.

The more time I spend with headphones, the more comfort and durability are important to me. The more i'm using uncomfortable headphones, the more compromising I am going to be on a sound signature. It should come warranted that if you want the best, go for the open headphones. There comfort is important, but there are a lot less demands in terms of portability. One should have an open mind for closed, portable headphones, since there will be stuff lost.


It's total bullshit what people are paying now for headphones though. If people are paying for the niche $1,000 headphones though, for the most part, they are paying for future research in cheaper headphones though. To me, with the China crap, I can pay $200 and get a great headphone. I just wish some of the bigger, more reliable manufacturer's picked that up, and spent $100 or $200 extra dollars toward making a good design (or just used the M50x design and made a competent driver). Really, there needs to be more in the $200-$400 dollar range that is fully encompassing, like how that series for open headphones is a template for 90% of what one may be able to fully acquire for open headphones.

French officers would down 1 or 2 of these before dashing over the parapet and on to their deaths. It’s my favorite New Years drink.

That sounds good. With the 12600 I shouldnt have any issues with it bottlenecking the 3070 right? Just want to check

"I've started checking Amazon.  Not much more tha box stores nearby.

Example - needed a certain door lock/combo to match existing.  HD was out - Lowe's was higher.  Amazon was 25$ cheaper than cheapest locally.

Needed sill pan for a new door, I can't fab one - ordered from Big A.

New Framing nailer 80$ cheaper.

Needed new chalk line and rather than drive, since I was ordering anyway - Big A and cheaper also.

It's not going to be WalMart that kills retail but Amazon.

I really like to support local, but since the local does not even exist anymore, it's just as ez to support Big A a the box stores.

Too bad they don't ship 2x4's  :)"
