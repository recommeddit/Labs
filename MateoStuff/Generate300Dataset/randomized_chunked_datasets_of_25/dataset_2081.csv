14975,"It really depends on what you enjoy in your books.  I prefer romance books with some other plot other than the romance driving it forward.


* Suzanne Brockmann - Navy SEALs heroes


* Nalini Singh - Psy/Changing or Archangel series.  Her style can be a little purple prosey or florid, but the stories are good so I can ignore it.


* Ilona Andrews - considered more urban fantasy but strong romantic elements in all of the books (Hidden Legacy, The Edge, Kate Daniels, Innkeeper Chronicles)


* Linnea Sinclair for scifi romance


* Shelly Laurenston - funny were/shifter romances


* Ann Aguirre - Sirantha Jax sf, Corinne Solomon UF?, Bronze God/Silver Mirror Fantasy


* Lara Adrian and JR Ward - vampire (if you can get over the fact that 200+ year old vampires talk like hardcore gangsters and the names are seriously ridiculous)


I've stopped reading historicals for the most part, but my favorites were:
Julie Garwood, Lisa Kleypas, Julia Quinn, Judith McNaught, Eloisa James, Sherry Thomas


I like Courtney Milan for her modern books and didn't really get into her historicals -but she's really highly rated by readers, especially since her heroes tend to not of the aristocracy.
