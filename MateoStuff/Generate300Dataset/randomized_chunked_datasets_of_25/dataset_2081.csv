21303,best workout music,"DMX - X gon give it to ya 

AKA that one song from Rick and Morty's workout montage."
65582,best phone service company,I’m in Oakland and Verizon has never given me any problems throughout East Bay or in the city.
2774,best headphones,"Maybe it’s been tested and it’s crap, but have you tested the Creative SXFI Theater?"
15125,best tree for the garden,How tall?
36786,best alcoholic drink,"Vodka or gin soda w lime is my go to—they’re refreshing and very drinkable, low cal/carb if you care about that, and won’t give you a stomachache or nasty hangover from a bunch of added sugars. I also like long islands if I’m just trying to get drunk, and beer if it’s on tap!"
37599,best Marvel movie,"I mean, I do think it is the worst MCU movie. Key point being in the MCU. 

I don't think it's a bad movie, but it is probably the most mediocre movie in the MCU even neglecting the casting change and all that."
67040,best places to skydive in california,Cool!
49383,best gaming monitor,Yeah I've seen them go that low as well. If you don't mind waiting until black Friday then theres a good chance itll drop to that again. Then again we dont know. Btw this monitor is also the same panel as the LG so a Nano IPS display.
15908,best sunglasses for fashion,Buying from China is usually lower quality...
14551,best romantic novel,This series is SO GOOD. I loved all the books and read them so quickly. 10/10
55024,best places to hike in the east coast,Adirondacks in upstate NY are truly beautiful. You’re also within range of the AT and Green Mountains of VT.
53158,best hiphop album,project x — ken car$on
60418,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Ash Vs. Evil Dead

Its a hell of a roller coaster of laughs and horror. Bruce Campbell never loses a beat with the entire series."
14975,best romantic novel,"It really depends on what you enjoy in your books.  I prefer romance books with some other plot other than the romance driving it forward.


* Suzanne Brockmann - Navy SEALs heroes


* Nalini Singh - Psy/Changing or Archangel series.  Her style can be a little purple prosey or florid, but the stories are good so I can ignore it.


* Ilona Andrews - considered more urban fantasy but strong romantic elements in all of the books (Hidden Legacy, The Edge, Kate Daniels, Innkeeper Chronicles)


* Linnea Sinclair for scifi romance


* Shelly Laurenston - funny were/shifter romances


* Ann Aguirre - Sirantha Jax sf, Corinne Solomon UF?, Bronze God/Silver Mirror Fantasy


* Lara Adrian and JR Ward - vampire (if you can get over the fact that 200+ year old vampires talk like hardcore gangsters and the names are seriously ridiculous)


I've stopped reading historicals for the most part, but my favorites were:
Julie Garwood, Lisa Kleypas, Julia Quinn, Judith McNaught, Eloisa James, Sherry Thomas


I like Courtney Milan for her modern books and didn't really get into her historicals -but she's really highly rated by readers, especially since her heroes tend to not of the aristocracy.


A good website if you want recommendations is [Dear Author](http://dearauthor.com/) or [Smart Bitches Trashy Books](http://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/)"
68784,best science fiction novel,I envy you for being able to read the Culture series for the first time. :D
53896,best medicine for a cold,"Buckleys! I swear by that stuff. 

Their slogan is ""It tastes terrible, but it really works"". Let me tell you, it is accurate on both of those statements."
32789,best free online grammar checker,"I do this same thing. If I'm not comfortable with my usage of a word, I look it up in the dictionary and decide. I then go back and make it consistent throughout my work. I'm a college instructor and used to write full time for a regular job though, so I haven't been brave enough to go back into freelancing yet."
42858,best detective show,"I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

Spoilers:

They glanced over the fact that they drove the wrong guy to suicide and those wannabe Sherlock internet detectives still kept investigating. Then they try to shame the audience at the end for watching their documentary. One of the worst documentaries I've ever seen."
1199,best ice cream flavor,"Love this stuff too and I will always order it if I find it on the menu. Sounds like it would be gross, but it tastes very chocolaty and smooth. Yum!"
15193,best tree for the garden,"They’re expensive to maintain compared to smaller native trees that don’t need regular pruning. I see these trees regularly split out after a storm in yards where homeowners neglected to drop the $$$ to get them pruned regularly.  They’re also an invasive, ecological nightmare!

29829,best money managing app,"I like Money Manager Ex: https://www.moneymanagerex.org/

It's free, open source, multi platform, portable and cloud compatible. I use it since about two years. It's very easy to use but at the same time it is very capable. You can use multiple currencies at once, keep track of your stock portfolio etc pp. 

You have a great overview over your assets and can always display various reports (where the money comes from, where it goes, your usage depending on categories etc)."
21188,best workout music,"I must say that I'm pleased to see Protest the Hero represented here. Their latest album [Volition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5_RJHsaqpA) has some really high energy/tempo songs. There's also a lot of anger/angst on the album, something which I find always helps me go for one more rep."
69854,best major to study in college,"Cosmolgy/Astrophysics! 

edit: thank you so much for all the advice! I know it won't be easy but hey, no pain no gain right :P I'm actually going to work really hard on my math now after this. And if I slack, I'll just go back to this page and re-read everything."
