71343,"Thank you for the nice list. I watched The uninvited and it became one of my favourites. I somehow expected Anna to be the killer but when I FOUND OUT ALEX WAS DEAD THE WHOLE TIME, THE WHOLE TIME. Oh damn I fucking threw my headphones away. Oldboy also became one of my favourites. Probably in TOP5. It was disturbing and the fact that we weren't watching the main character's revenge story the whole time. Oh fuck. And for last but not least, I think No way out is way overrated. I found it boring and I also found the twist making no sense at all. And thank you once again buddy, two of your recommendation became my favourite.",best movies with a cool twist

But I always play with anti aliasing. Now your post makes it seem like Anti  aliasing isn't actually that neccessary to make the game look prettier? Or is that specific to ultrawide 4k gaming, because you can't see the pixel anyways so you don't have to smooth them?
