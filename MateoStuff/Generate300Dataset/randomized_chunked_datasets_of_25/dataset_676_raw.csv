Definetely worth buying."

I bought one of those knock off Yeti cups from Walmart.  It works amazingly.  It's kept ice frozen in my cup for a full 24 hours.

I know. Everyone in my family wanted to see Black Panther and they’re not Marvel fans at all. It was a fun experience seeing the movie with my Godmother. I just think EG was better tbh. No offense.
"Anyone have a good can opener? No matter what I buy they are all trash. Even bought a $20 one, still sucks at opening cans."
Zoom Pegasus 37 is my recovery shoe where I run 4 miles. They help me focus on glute propulsion and are very cushioning. They are also wider than most nikes I've ordered. I had to go a size up for my big toe and do a runners knit for the heel lift. I'm also a 115 lb woman so the fit for you may be different but based on your post it is what I recommend
"Oh my gosh, thanks for this.  I'm searching Reddit for info on water filters, found out about Berkey from this thread, and was blown away by the difference in price from your comparison.  I want to verify the price myself before buying, but I'm so glad to have heard about Berkey's competitors.  Thanks!."
"I'm not sure I'd call it ""massive,"" but the Dutch/French film The Vanishing has a pretty satisfying twist in it."
Probably going with a clear case. Have apple care so depending how slippery it is with the new back I might go caseless.
"I’ve always heard about the twist in the movie so I was super curious when I watched it. When it came, I was so surprised and WTF’d that I still don’t know how to feel about it"

I can't really name which book in the Vorkosigan books because I read almost all of them back-to-back and the boundaries between them are fuzzy in my m ind."
"Jesus, everyone in this thread so worried about hipsters. Sure I find them annoying but its not like its an actual problem. I lived in sf for 4 years, I've seen my fair share of hipsters. Just ignore them and move on with your day."

"Can confirm - live it Dayton, met Dave twice.  Exceedingly nice guy.

My favorite Dave story:

I'm in the local cell phone store to upgrade, transfer my contacts, etc.  I'm pretty focused on working with the customer rep to get through the process quickly so I'm kinda aimed forward, but I'm hearing bits of the conversation with the service rep next to me...

I hear ...Do do you want this random expensive service?....yes.  Okay.....Do you want this other random expensive feature....yes....

I'm like ""this guy is loading up - its gonna be a small fortune when he walks outta here"".  So there is a slight pause in the conversation, and then I hear (in a very tongue-in-cheek, self-deprecating voice)  ""You know, I'm rich....give me all that shit..."".  I turn to look...and yep....Dave Chappelle with a big shit-eating grin on his face.

I finished up my business and left - during that time, everyone did their best to act normal, and just be.  I think this is why Dave stays around - everyone genuinely wants him to have as normal a day-to-day experience as someone of his fame can have."
"Australia - Most successful team;   
Highlights include:Donald Bradman and the Invincibles, Steve Waugh's 17 test win team, 3 world cups in a row, Shane Warne / Glenn McGrath combo  
Lowlights: World Series Cricket    
  

England - The homeland of cricket, the reason we have the game today;
Highlights: Lords, WC Grace, SF Barnes, reclaiming ashes for the first time in 15 odd years in 2005  
Lowlights: Bodyline 

West Indies: have some of the most talented players of all time;  
Highlights: Dominant team of the 80s, arguably second best in terms of greatest XI to represent the country (Headley, Lara, Sobers, Weekes, Viv Richards, Marshall, Walsh, Ambrose, Holding, Garner etc etc)  
Lowlights: Since the mid 90s, they have had been very average in test cricket with only a few highlights

New Zealand: Mediocre most of its cricketing life  
Highlights: Paddles (Sir Richard Hadlee), Current team is as good a ODI team it has ever had.  
Lowlights: Early 2000s wasn't a great time for NZ cricket, all out for 26 in a test match innings...

South Africa: Another immensely talented team, currently the best team in cricket (talent wise)  
Highlights:  Pollock(s), Kallis, Current period of cricket 
Lowlights: Banned from international cricket for many years, 1999 world cup. Haven't won an elimination match at any world cup.   
 
Sri Lanka: Similar to WI, loads of individual talent but no sustained dominant period  
Highlight: My favourite player Kumar Sangakkara; Ranatunga and Co winning the 96 world cup.  Murali (most test wickets, has taken a 10fa!)  
Lowlight: IMO 2011 world cup final - so disappointing after their wonderful tournament.. folded like a house of cards   

I feel other people may be better qualified to discuss India / Pakistan cricket though :)"
