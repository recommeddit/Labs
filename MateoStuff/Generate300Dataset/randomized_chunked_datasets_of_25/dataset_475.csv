37828,"The last time I was this excited for an MCU film (that wasn't an Avengers film) was *Doctor Strange*, and that ended up being my #12 MCU film, so I learned a hard lesson. *Shang-Chi* just outclassed it in every way - the narrative, the villain, the foils, the humour, the imagination, the *heart*.

My only two gripes with *Shang-Chi* were minor, and they related to pacing and the under-development of Razorfist, particularly the missed opportunity to position him more explicitly against Shang-Chi as Wenwu's ""adopted"" son. Alternately, I quite enjoyed that the ""family"" aspect which elevated so much of the emotional complexity of this film (and particularly its villain) was contained within the four main roles of the family. 

So, my first gripe is forgivable and the second will likely be explored/developed in a sequel. I really can't complain too much at all.
