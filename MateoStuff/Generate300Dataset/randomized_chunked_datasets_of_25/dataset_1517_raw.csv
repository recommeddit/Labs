"I once worked for a hotel booking sort of call centre company. We had Shaq book the Ritz for himself once, under his own name. AJ Mclean booked once under his name, and I also personally booked Andrea Martin and Bonnie Hunt on separate occasions, both under their own names.

The Shaq call was hilarious, we all listened to the recording.

""OK, can I get a first name for the booking?""

""Shaquille.""

""Oh, you're in good company! And the last name?""

""O'Neal.""

""OK Mr. O-... Sh... Shaq?"""

"Check out *Skydive Perris* near L.A. (about 1 1/2 hour drive from downtown L.A.). They've been around a long time and I've had some great jumps there. Friendly people, fair prices, and lots of options.  It's going to be hot as fuck if you go during a heat wave - so be prepared to sweat while you're on the ground.

And it has been going up for 10 years now. So if you have a child nearing college age you would have easily made a good return saving for college.
