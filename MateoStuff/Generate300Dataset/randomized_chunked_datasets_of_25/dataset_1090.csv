The obvious ones like fight club and the prestige, great movies!

Seven is one of my all time favorites but I think someone has already mentioned it

I watched a movie on Netflix once called 13 sins (I think?) And I remember it having a great ending with an exciting twist. Haven't been able to find it again

But my all time favorite twist ending to a movie was the ending to Arrival. Such an amazing twist and probably the best alien movie I've ever seen.",best movies with a cool twist

Dorney, ValleyFair and MiA all seem to be in the same boat. I hope you guys all see some new coasters, or at least some good relocations, soon. The theme of WoF seems pretty cool at least.",best amusement park

10798,"My gun case is the luggage. It does not fit in a soft case. You're right though, TSA can't make any identifying marks on the case indicating it's a firearm. However, seeing a pelican case (especially if it's a 1700 series) has a high probability or being a firearm. Secondly, pelican cases in general are seen as carrying important and often valuable stuff (cameras, guns, electronics/computers) so they are already a theft risk. 

Plus if you're smart and noticed non-TSA locks you would have again a high chance of some sort of firearm in that case or it would have to have TSA locks.",best suitcase lock

Okay, anything by Ilona Andrews is golden, their Kate Daniels and Hidden Legacy series are amazing, then Romancing the Duke by Tessa Dare if you're into historicals, Penny Reid and her Knitting in the City and Winston Brothers series are pretty good too, and I really like Caitie Quinn's Brew Ha Ha series (they're chaste, as in the most action that happens is a kiss here and there but still really sweet).
