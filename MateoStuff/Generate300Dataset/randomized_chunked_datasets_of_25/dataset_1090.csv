9728,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Chi-5 are the best. Personally I would choose San Nic, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, Anacapa, Santa Cruz (in order). But they are all pretty similar and any would be good. Manzanita is more sophomores. FT is a mile off campus but 1/3 of the freshmen class lives there."

51468,best iphone case,So it is their silicone that is of good quality? Usually the silicone clings in the pockets and above all takes all the dust on it.
1851,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Rusty’s is reasonably similar to Round Table. But there are many better spots like Bettina and Olio Pizzeria.
72010,best movies with a cool twist,"So I have a few,

The obvious ones like fight club and the prestige, great movies!

Seven is one of my all time favorites but I think someone has already mentioned it

I watched a movie on Netflix once called 13 sins (I think?) And I remember it having a great ending with an exciting twist. Haven't been able to find it again

But my all time favorite twist ending to a movie was the ending to Arrival. Such an amazing twist and probably the best alien movie I've ever seen."

3809,best college for research,"That’d be M not W for mit,Harvard location"
37232,best amusement park,"Looking at WoF's history, it seems like Cedar Fair had a lot of interest in the park for the first 15 years or so after they bought it and then haven't bothered to add any major coasters in over a decade. An 11 year drought is pretty shitty of them.

Dorney, ValleyFair and MiA all seem to be in the same boat. I hope you guys all see some new coasters, or at least some good relocations, soon. The theme of WoF seems pretty cool at least."

10798,best suitcase lock,"My gun case is the luggage. It does not fit in a soft case. You're right though, TSA can't make any identifying marks on the case indicating it's a firearm. However, seeing a pelican case (especially if it's a 1700 series) has a high probability or being a firearm. Secondly, pelican cases in general are seen as carrying important and often valuable stuff (cameras, guns, electronics/computers) so they are already a theft risk. 

Plus if you're smart and noticed non-TSA locks you would have again a high chance of some sort of firearm in that case or it would have to have TSA locks."
31701,best hotel to live in,"""Back home"" - is that your parents?

Dude, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If all you need is a change, go camping for a week. You'll love the hotel when you get back to it."

15009,best romantic novel,"Oh, I'm so happy you liked it!! Hmm let me think about it... Okay, anything by Ilona Andrews is golden, their Kate Daniels and Hidden Legacy series are amazing, then Romancing the Duke by Tessa Dare if you're into historicals, Penny Reid and her Knitting in the City and Winston Brothers series are pretty good too, and I really like Caitie Quinn's Brew Ha Ha series (they're chaste, as in the most action that happens is a kiss here and there but still really sweet). 

I read a lot of romance as you can tell lol but yeah, I hope you enjoy at least something from this list."
