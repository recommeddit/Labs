6926,"Keep in mind we’re speaking in relative terms, not absolute terms. It’s about how the phone was at the time of its release.

The iPhone X was a massive improvement over the previous year’s iPhone 7, in everything from design (full screen, Face ID, new gesture system) to the display (OLED) to the materials used (stainless steel rather than aluminum). It was also a big camera upgrade, a decent performance upgrade, and a nice improvement in battery life.

The XS offered none of that. It was the same design, the performance boost was minuscule (ie. the CPU gain was 15%, which is the smallest ever for an iPhone), and even the RAM felt limited. It increased from 3GB to 4GB, but it sure didn’t feel like it. If you compare the X and XS, the list of improvements is pretty paltry. Some of the ‘headline’ upgrades are the fact that it went from IP67 to IP68, and the fact that the Neural Engine was improved. Pretty minor stuff from a user’s point of view.

Also, the battery actually got *worse*, and in many ways, so did the camera. If you read the camera reviews, the XS wasn’t some incremental upgrade, but rather, the camera system was completely redesigned. And while this redesign helped a bit with low light photos, it also made everything flatter and more washed out. So even in absolute terms, it was worse in some ways.

Basically, the XS had two things going against it. Firstly, the improvements over the X were very minor, and secondly, in some cases, it actually got *worse* (battery life and daytime photography).

Taken together, owning an iPhone XS in 2018 was nowhere near as good an experience as owning an iPhone X in 2017. I’ve owned every flagship iPhone since the 4S in 2011, and the XS was the first and only time I actually regretted buying the new one. Looking back, I would have rather saved my money and gone another year with the X until picking up the 11 Pro.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a good phone (after all, it’s an iPhone), but if we’re ranking iPhones from best to worse, it’s definitely one of the least impressive releases.",best iPhone
