38143,best Marvel movie,"I gotta say... I'm super confused as to why people are coming down so hard on Captain Marvel when you listed Ultron and Dark World. Dark World is, I think, the worst film in the entire MCU and Ultron is not far behind to me."
2330,best headphones,Having Ldac doesn't mean anything if the user has an iphone
27456,best bollywood actor,Jane bhi do yaaron
46574,best trick or treating candy,My ass if Utah is Peanut Butter M&M's
60888,Best comedy show on Netflix,It's terrible. Really poorly written. Avoid.
35035,best NFL player,"If you take away all of Gretzky's goals he is still the all time points leader. I don't care what era that's in, you can't touch that. He's that far above everyone that played in the same era as him too."
4339,best text editor,[edlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edlin)
69068,best science fiction novel,"I'd have a hard time limiting it to **ten**, let alone three. Maybe I can think of three that possibly haven't already been mentioned.

* The High Crusade, Poul Anderson
* The Maker of Universes, Philip Jose Farmer
* A Time of Changes, Robert Silverberg

Not my top favorites, but they're entertaining and I seldom see them mentioned here. 

Oh, and a fun book that doesn't pretend to have any deep message: *Martians, Go Home!* by Fredric Brown."
28666,best breakfast foods,"came here to say the same, the best thing about the south is the food (and people wonder why the south is so fat)

I could live on [biscuits and gravy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuits_and_gravy). Keep in mind biscuits have a different meaning in America, we aren't eating cookies.

I don't care for grits though. It's a porridge made from corn. You have to dump so much butter and salt on it you might as well just eat a stick of salted butter."
70678,best movies with a cool twist,">!No that's the thing, you see covered glass cages that would have been used as the bait but you only ever see the one ""Angier"" during the close up (final shot).!<

>!The theory is based much more on what's not shown rather than what is. That's why it's a bit of a stretch.!<"
68428,best science fiction novel,"I am a long time sci-fi reader and this book is by far the least liked book I have ever read. I just hated it throughout. Slow, plodding, obvious, irritating, boring. I had to finish it but it was torture all the way. Fuck those stupid monks. Clearly it works for many others."
6687,best iPhone,You’re not a big social media person but you’re on reddit? Doesn’t being on Reddit automatically qualify you as a social media person? I could be wrong but I don’t log into Reddit on my computer. Only on my iPad and my iPhones.
56682,best desktop monitor,"Guys I'm thinking about  pulling the plug on an AOC Agon Black. Naturally I'm feeling a lot of anxiety about spending so much money on something I cant see first. So want to make absolutely sure I'm making the right decision. 

I've been internally debating monitors for weeks and it's easily been the hardest piece to choose out of the entire build. 

Reviews are favorable. What's the communities opinion in the monitor. Shoukd I take the plunge?"
40884,best instrument to play,"Drums, not portable but well I find it really appealing.
If you have a nice singing/not singing voice it almost can erase the fact that you're no attractive."
34487,best NFL player,I wanna hang out with Arian Foster.
22855,best celebrity,"I wouldn't sweat it. Musicians understand their demographic and a 12 year old kid isn't exactly the topic expected fan of Ringo Starr, especially on his solo All-Starr ventures. He was there more for the adults that would appreciate his music. It's not like you shattered his hopes or anything, he went on to be as successful solo as he could hope for. 

Also, I loved the store telling vibe on this ""eyes like saucers, like I was shaking hands with Charles Manson."" Have an upvote."
14512,best romantic novel,"The Wall of Winnepeg and Me or Kulti, those are my two favorites"
6075,best Netflix documentary,‘The Business is Drugs’ was really good. The only thing I didn’t like was how involved the host was. It felt very ‘look at me’. But she is a badass.
30590,best Mexican war to study,I didnt include French and Indian because it was pre US.  Indians I actually didnt think about. But I think most people would say unjustified.
29435,best game console,"Um...Persona remake for PSP, Dragon Age: Origins, Legend of the Ghost Lion, Twisted, and The Walking Dead."
22089,best celebrity,"Andy Richter. Used to come in to the plant store I worked at. Bonded over the fact we were both from the midwest, always nice, and even tipped me when he wasn’t supposed to."
54361,best medicine for a cold,"Zinc tablets.

But don't take them on an empty stomach."
18255,best YouTube video,"There are literally dozens of us! Seriously, *Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum* is one of my top ten albums, and it kills me that no one knows about them."
27288,best stocks to buy,"What does that even mean?  MSFT has gone 10x in the last decade.  I would love all my stocks to become ""Microsofted"" if that's the case."
19020,best YouTube video,I love how hyped the comments section gets when he busts out the disc pick that him and Bosnian Bill designed
