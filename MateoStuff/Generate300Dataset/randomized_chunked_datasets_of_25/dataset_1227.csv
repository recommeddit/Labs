2376,best headphones,">If you want really quality wireless your best bet is a good wired headset and a bluetooth dac/amp like the fiio btr5 or one of shanlings options. 

How would that work when there is a 1m+ long cable? I mean where does that go, how do you ""convert"" I guess a wired to a wireless?"

26378,best politician,"Last I checked, something like 3 congresspeople didn't have college degrees. 
(This was on a wikipedia binge a couple years ago though, so grain of salt.)

Not quite what you're asking, but 'average joe' isn't usually included on survey forms."
71243,best movies with a cool twist,Exactly! I loved rewatching it. Definitely holds up on its own.

5105,best home improvement store,"Home Depot seems to be marginally cheaper than Loweâ€™s, at least when Iâ€™ve compared prices online before going to the store. Lowes employees tend to be more helpful."
51186,best rap album,On this we can agree. It just left me wanting more from the main roster. I surprisingly agree with Complex on that one
4538,best text editor,"VSCoders (looking at you, u/CalcProgrammer1 and u/pnutjam), have you tried [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)?

From what I understand it's exactly the same, but without the 'Microsoft customization' (whatever that means). I'm not a FLOSS/FOSS purist, so it doesn't really matter that much to me - just wondering how it compares to the 'official' product. A few of my Windows-only friends swear by VSCode, so I might give that a shot :)"

56360,best desktop monitor,"Any news on when its coming out? 

Found the CX48 for Â£998 on QVC and I almost paid for it yesterday but 48 inches just pushes the limits on the amount of space i have for it. I may still go for it if LG dont release the 42 inch by May-June as im impatient and the cx48 is still great but 42 would be optimal for me"

20940,best workout music,"I fell in love with hooligans the first time I heard it and it's easily became one of my favorite songs by Keem. He definitely owed us those two singles for dropping out the XXL cypher ðŸ˜‚ Jokes aside, I'm really excited for his next project!"
43110,best detective show,Elementary is an enjoyable modern day Sherlock Holmes series.
24608,best anime,Gundam is complicated. Thereâ€™s multiple timelines.
41406,best instrument to play,"I've been in your position, but I maintain that your wording is confusing."
14993,best romantic novel,"There was a pretty decent (in my opinion) ""sequel"" to Gone With the Wind, written by a different author.  It's called ""Scarlet"" and I really liked it.  The same author has another book, ""Rhett Butler's People"", too, which is on my list to read."
21568,best winnie the pooh comic,"That's a good point, but when I watched the new Winnie the Pooh movie last summer, I found myself thinking ""Wow, Pooh is kind of a dick"". He was being so mean to Piglet! And I had intended to watch that movie to relive all the cute childhood memories, but at the end I just wanted to hug Eeyore and put duct tape over Pooh's mouth."
25928,best cricket teams of all time,"If only these stats showed how many tests were home
Vs away :)"
40186,best midrange CPU,"Honestly, I think the 10600K/F is a better bet right now than the 11400/F. It's only like $20 more right now, beats it by a bit stock, and beats it by a larger margin when overclocked. Even if you don't want to spend the extra money on a K board, you can always just unlock the power limits on a B560 board and get most(ish) of the benefits still."

25566,best cricket teams of all time,Viv 'only' averaged 50 and some would argue that isn't good enough for an all time xi. Viv was only just edged out in my team by Sangakara who's averaging 58 career and something like 70 in 70 tests as a specialist batsman. That's just to good to ignore.
2449,best headphones,"Sony MDR-7506. Cheaper than the ATH-M50x, and just as good, if not better."
