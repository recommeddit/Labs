"A place I worked at roughly 20 years ago, had that popcorn texture shit on the roof. We were notionally a 5 star hotel - but that always felt like a fucking stretch.

I remember some guy killed himself with a shotgun under his chin in one of out bigger suites, and painted the popcorn. A couple of people from housekeeping straight up quit rather than deal with it when management tried to bully them into cleaning blood and brain matter off a popcorn ceiling.

One guy from maintenance said he'd do it, but he wanted a promotion and a 5 year contract with a payout in the event of early dismissal. There was an argument about it and it was like 3 days of calling around getting quotes and arguing with lawyers about if they could give him that contract before they gave in. The smell was getting complaints from the entire floor. 

Dude did the whole cleanup with a pair of drywall ceiling stilts. Got the promotion and the contract. That shit can't have been legal, even then. But management didn't want the fuss of a hazmat crew or crime scene cleanup going through the hotel.

I left a few months after that, but I heard a few years later from a former coworker that they had an incident and fired all of housekeeping and maintenance. Except for that guy. He was the only person to survive the purge."
"Ok so turns out I was a bit wrong. 

They're called PlayStation Minis and they were first playable on the PSP, then later the PS3, and finally the Vita. They basically are DSi Ware games. I don't believe any had physical retail releases. They're digital only.

The PS3's built in PSP emulator is meant exclusively for PlayStation Minis but struggles with real PSP games if you load them with homebrew. You need to convert a PSP game into a PlayStation Mini or a PSP Remaster and stuff usually doesn't work right. 

Here's a rather in depth compatibility list:

I really don't know much about the PSP. I had a DS. And I don't know much about the Vita either. I just bought one last year and that was only because it was too cheap to pass up."

Hand size? Been looking at m42
"i have asked about him already in this thread, as someone mentioned him. i found Wizard's First Rule in a second hand shop and picked it up, but have been apprehensive about starting it, since it seems to have conflicted reviews. Why wouldn't you recommend him? What didn't you like about him?"
"**Rolling release, rolling update, or continuous delivery, in software development, is the concept of frequently delivering updates to applications. This is in contrast to a standard or point release development model which uses software versions that must be reinstalled over the previous version.**

"Google sheets is good because, it is collaborative and highly scriptable with google app scripts (clasp) even though I hate Javascript, I did use it. I wish I could use something like Python in google sheet, it would be so much easier and better. Also, if google sheets had an cli, then bash could have been used much more easily to manipulate the data."

He really does seem like the nicest guy.  I don't think he had any clue how many people would rally for him after the whole NBC ordeal!

And some very weird difficulty spikes.
