52416,best hiphop album,Hahaha kendrick lamar over illmatic
29643,best game console,"I've been watching some people play Sunset Overdrive and that looks like a ton of fun, the style makes me kind of nostalgic.

Out of all the games there are on consoles, the only 3 titles that have ever made me want a console were Lollipop Chainsaw, The Last Of Us, and now Sunset Overdrive."
61834,Best RPG game on PS4,"While path B is ""too similar"" to A, look at other games. When any other game offers you a NG+ mode, you play through exactly the same thing.
Here you play as a different character with a few new and changed mechanics, have somr new cutscenes and background info to collect."
4590,best text editor,"It may not be in the ballpark you are looking for, but I purchased a lifetime license for Ultraedit maybe 15 years ago. Back then it was Windows only, but that is where I wrote most of my scripts from. These days, the license is cross platform. 

I know there are many tools listed here that are more in line with the linux way, but the feature set, and ease of use is pretty outstanding and I still use it to this day. The key features that I really like are:

1. Code folding
2. Bookmarking
3. Column mode (including sum columns)
4. Easily recordable macros"
46572,best trick or treating candy,"I call bullshit on this. Fuck no, with this Jolly Rancher bullshit."
26556,best board games,"I haven’t played Desert, but I’ve also heard from plenty of people who prefer it to Island. It changes up the formula a bit and sounds like it has some fun mechanics; I bet it’ll be great!"
25368,best spiderman actor,MCU MJ is nothing like 616 or Ultimate I'm sorry dude but that's straight up false.
65841,best college in california,Possibly with the 2 years at a JC and then transferring?
19625,best YouTube video,#CAAAAAAARRRRRRLLLLLLLLLLLL
57470,best water brand,"Life water, today I was at some store in my city I'm buying bottled water. Well as I looked to see what the options are I see it the very overpriced $8 bottle if Life Water and next to it a bottle of water the same size for like $2. Heh?"
43794,best items under $100,"I had one of these until one of my roommates put the tray on wrong. To explain to the non-pizzazz owners here, the little tray spins and the heating elements won’t turn on unless the tray is in and the timer is turned.

My roommate somehow put the tray in such that it wouldn’t spin, but it still hit the sensor to let it turn the heating elements on. It ended up starting a small fire and melting the one section of the tray to the point it wasn’t usable anymore."
15462,best tree for the garden,"So helpful, thank you for all the details! I’ll look into them. Hopefully I can do lots of shrubs. :)"
59351,best perfume,A discontinued one called poppy blossom by coach. So sad I can’t get it anymore
57062,best water brand,Anything but dasani. It taste like dirt.
50490,best rap album,had to scroll far for this..
7569,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I'd say go for the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14"" on my list. It is $510 and offers decent specs for the price: Ryzen 5 5500U, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS 300 nit display. The display is better than most other alternatives at this price point."

8324,best toothpaste,FYI if you see friends selling “miracle whitening toothpaste” on FB/Instagram this is what it is.
27247,best stocks to buy,"AMZN - I like that they are always on the lookout for growth in new areas

NVDA - Nvidia is really the company of the future. I'm amazed how Mr. Jensen is able to visualize the future. Mad respect. 

CRM - Great management and fanstatic business model

COST - Again, great business model. They have been able to not just sustain their brick and mortar industry, but grow in the age of e-commerce. Also, people are always gonna eat and reproduce. 

INTC - While I do believe, Intel is past its prime, its heavily undervalued at this point. It seems market likes to sell it on any given day - good or bad lol. But I believe in Pat's vision and agree that he is on the right path to reviving the company. Also, they have very generous dividends."
41291,best instrument to play,"Yeah it's a hard debate... Both sides have valid arguments. Perhaps instruments should be classified as objects that make a single note. I've seen people using launchpads on youtube by just pressing a button and having it play 3 seconds of a song and remix it with drums. To me, that's more of a on-the-go garage band application. There are other videos where people individually play each note and, to me, that's the musical instrument part of launchpads."
28980,best breakfast foods,"I looooooove a simple french omelet, a la Jacque Pepin. It's gorgeous, silky, and delicate, and you can show off your mad cooking skills with it. I love to grate Gruyere with a microplane onto the inside of the omelet right before rolling it off the pan. Sooooooo good."
55426,best action and adventure novel series,"I'm surprised no one mentions Jules Verne. Mysterious Island. Around the world in 80 days, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea."
24294,best anime,"Bebop second and FLCL seventh. I certainly can't complain about that. This list feels better to me than the ones I see on MAL and AnimePlanet. I understand saying that probably labels me as some sort of elitist or something, but who cares."
56804,best desktop monitor,"https://www.amazon.com/Acer-GN246HL-Bbid-24-Inch-Display/dp/B00KO4518I/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1468287858&sr=1-1&keywords=Gn246HL

Fantastic Monitor. 24 inch, 144hz, 1ms response time, Low profile. Good shit."
