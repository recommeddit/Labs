29643,"I've been watching some people play Sunset Overdrive and that looks like a ton of fun, the style makes me kind of nostalgic.

Out of all the games there are on consoles, the only 3 titles that have ever made me want a console were Lollipop Chainsaw, The Last Of Us, and now Sunset Overdrive.",best game console
61834,"While path B is ""too similar"" to A, look at other games. When any other game offers you a NG+ mode, you play through exactly the same thing.
Here you play as a different character with a few new and changed mechanics, have somr new cutscenes and background info to collect.",Best RPG game on PS4
4590,"It may not be in the ballpark you are looking for, but I purchased a lifetime license for Ultraedit maybe 15 years ago. Back then it was Windows only, but that is where I wrote most of my scripts from. These days, the license is cross platform. 

I know there are many tools listed here that are more in line with the linux way, but the feature set, and ease of use is pretty outstanding and I still use it to this day. The key features that I really like are:

1. Code folding
2. Bookmarking
3. Column mode (including sum columns)
4. Easily recordable macros",best text editor

My roommate somehow put the tray in such that it wouldn’t spin, but it still hit the sensor to let it turn the heating elements on. It ended up starting a small fire and melting the one section of the tray to the point it wasn’t usable anymore.",best items under $100

27247,"AMZN - I like that they are always on the lookout for growth in new areas

NVDA - Nvidia is really the company of the future. I'm amazed how Mr. Jensen is able to visualize the future. Mad respect. 

CRM - Great management and fanstatic business model

COST - Again, great business model. They have been able to not just sustain their brick and mortar industry, but grow in the age of e-commerce. Also, people are always gonna eat and reproduce. 

INTC - While I do believe, Intel is past its prime, its heavily undervalued at this point. It seems market likes to sell it on any given day - good or bad lol. But I believe in Pat's vision and agree that he is on the right path to reviving the company. Also, they have very generous dividends.",best stocks to buy
41291,"Yeah it's a hard debate... Both sides have valid arguments. Perhaps instruments should be classified as objects that make a single note. I've seen people using launchpads on youtube by just pressing a button and having it play 3 seconds of a song and remix it with drums. To me, that's more of a on-the-go garage band application. There are other videos where people individually play each note and, to me, that's the musical instrument part of launchpads.",best instrument to play
