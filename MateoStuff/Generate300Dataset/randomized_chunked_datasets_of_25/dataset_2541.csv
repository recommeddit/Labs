It makes sense -- when you get a fluoride treatment at the dentists, they leave it on for a few minutes to do its work. When you brush your teeth, if you immediately rinse out the toothpaste... well, you aren't getting any of the fluoride. Like at all. According to them, you should brush your teeth, spit out the excess, and then just... carry on with life. If you really dont like the taste/feel, you can rinse, just give it ten mins or so before you do."
