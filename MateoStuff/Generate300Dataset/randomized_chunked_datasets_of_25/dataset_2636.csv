68911,"I should be clearer about that, sorry. I don’t mean this sub is bigoted; that’s what I meant by “not outright hostile.” Just that if you were to list the types of books that this sub recommends over and over again and show that list to a member of the Puppies movement then the latter would find little to object to. This sub tends to stick to straight white male authors that write stories that don’t (or only tangentially) touch on modern politics, with the exception of two or three women that have gone leagues above and beyond many of the male authors. 

You’ll see Ursula Le Guin or Octavia Butler, but you never see a woman of the same caliber as, say, Dennis Taylor, whose Bobiverse books are recommended all the time.",best science fiction novel

Sure some could be seen as silly nowadays, but others are normal modern day technology today.

Ed Sheeran. In 2013, my husband was working at a stadium and got free tickets for my 13-year-old niece to see Taylor Swift, but she was mostly excited for Ed. He was relatively unknown at the time and was the opener. This was the 2nd night of the show, so my husband knew that if we were back stage at his office at a certain time (after he sang a song with Taylor), he would pass by. So, we went back and waited and, sure enough, he came upon us with his band. We were the only people around and my niece was *barely* holding it together, she loved him so much . He talked to us for several minutes, signed everything she asked, took photos (photo of them together https://imgur.com/a/grDH5hH) and have her his guitar pick. Could not have been nicer. She lost it and started bawling her eyes out as soon as he left. It was incredible. I felt like the coolest aunt in the world. 

Gwyneth Paltrow, back in 2003 or 4, just before she announced she was pregnant the first time. She was staying in the hotel that I worked in as a shoe shine girl. We just made small talk, but she was very sweet and I felt like an equal with her.


I worked as a hostess in LA and these stood out as bad:

Martha Plimpton was very condescending 

I got a ""do you know who I am"" from Jeffrey Tambour when I didn't recognize him right away

Steve Madden said, ""do you know who I am? I'm Steve Madden. I have a store right down there on the promenade"" when he came in with 12 people and I didn't immediately have a table for him.",best celebrity
40984,I'm an advocate that the voice is an instrument and is the most organic to the body.

67047,"The nice thing about the Bay Area is that it has \*tons\* of great dropzones. Byron, Hollister, Skydive California, and SkyDance all are great places. Skydive CA in Tracy is the new one on the block, and it's where I've jumped most lately and it's great. Basically as long as you avoid Lodi they're all pretty great. (Hollister sometimes has a mixed reputation, but ignore the haters.)

Honestly, you're not going to remember much of freefall so optimizing for ""views"" is kind of silly. It'll all be beautiful in the air. I've never jumped at (or even really heard of) Skydive Golden Gate, but I'm sure they're fine too.",best places to skydive in california
