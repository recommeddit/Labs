8135,best toothpaste,I think we've covered all the bases here.
51878,best iphone case,I had this exact thought today too.
6406,best Netflix documentary,"Deep Water

Capturing the Friedmans

Big River Man"
34821,best NFL player,">Donald had a down year by his standards.

Must be nice to win DPOY in a down year."
68911,best science fiction novel,"I should be clearer about that, sorry. I don’t mean this sub is bigoted; that’s what I meant by “not outright hostile.” Just that if you were to list the types of books that this sub recommends over and over again and show that list to a member of the Puppies movement then the latter would find little to object to. This sub tends to stick to straight white male authors that write stories that don’t (or only tangentially) touch on modern politics, with the exception of two or three women that have gone leagues above and beyond many of the male authors. 

You’ll see Ursula Le Guin or Octavia Butler, but you never see a woman of the same caliber as, say, Dennis Taylor, whose Bobiverse books are recommended all the time."
15761,best sunglasses for fashion,"Have had a pair for four years, love em."
68575,best science fiction novel,"I do and most of them I've read are awesome.... not always from the style of writing, but those ideas people had back in those days are great. Sure some could be seen as silly nowadays, but others are normal modern day technology today. But thats a thing with classics, you might need some time and they are hardly an easy read."
22478,best celebrity,"Nice:  

Ed Sheeran. In 2013, my husband was working at a stadium and got free tickets for my 13-year-old niece to see Taylor Swift, but she was mostly excited for Ed. He was relatively unknown at the time and was the opener. This was the 2nd night of the show, so my husband knew that if we were back stage at his office at a certain time (after he sang a song with Taylor), he would pass by. So, we went back and waited and, sure enough, he came upon us with his band. We were the only people around and my niece was *barely* holding it together, she loved him so much . He talked to us for several minutes, signed everything she asked, took photos (photo of them together https://imgur.com/a/grDH5hH) and have her his guitar pick. Could not have been nicer. She lost it and started bawling her eyes out as soon as he left. It was incredible. I felt like the coolest aunt in the world. 

Gwyneth Paltrow, back in 2003 or 4, just before she announced she was pregnant the first time. She was staying in the hotel that I worked in as a shoe shine girl. We just made small talk, but she was very sweet and I felt like an equal with her.


I worked as a hostess in LA and these stood out as bad:

Martha Plimpton was very condescending 

I got a ""do you know who I am"" from Jeffrey Tambour when I didn't recognize him right away

Steve Madden said, ""do you know who I am? I'm Steve Madden. I have a store right down there on the promenade"" when he came in with 12 people and I didn't immediately have a table for him."
40984,best instrument to play,I'm an advocate that the voice is an instrument and is the most organic to the body. Exploring this and getting in tune with yourself as a musician will make any extension (any other instrument) much easier than without this process. I would suggest picking something that really calls to you.
33931,best Pokemon game,"Fire Red/leaf green is a remake of red/blue. They added some Pokemon and areas that are from silver/gold and changed some of the stats and what not. The game is a blast. I actually just finished a full run of fire red that I started out of the blue and can't stop playing. 

I also recommend PokeMMO. You can install it in Android and play online with people. You can choose what region you start in and can customize your characters appearance."
40787,best instrument to play,"I've tried **learned** violin&viola, **cello**, flute, oboe, Oriental harp (koto), **piano**&harpsichord, and guitar as well as **voice**. ***Prize goes to the oboe*** for not making my head explode as I expected."
67676,axios alternatives reddit,"I have been using wretch lately, also seems like a very smooth wrapper around fetch."
67047,best places to skydive in california,"The nice thing about the Bay Area is that it has \*tons\* of great dropzones. Byron, Hollister, Skydive California, and SkyDance all are great places. Skydive CA in Tracy is the new one on the block, and it's where I've jumped most lately and it's great. Basically as long as you avoid Lodi they're all pretty great. (Hollister sometimes has a mixed reputation, but ignore the haters.)

Honestly, you're not going to remember much of freefall so optimizing for ""views"" is kind of silly. It'll all be beautiful in the air. I've never jumped at (or even really heard of) Skydive Golden Gate, but I'm sure they're fine too."
70480,best major to study in college,"Genetics Major here! Best: More specific than a general biology degree. Developing field with a wide variety of potential applications. 
Worst: Don’t get into “genetics” specific classes until late sophomore year / early junior year (makes it hard to switch majors if you end up hating it). Everyone expects you to go to graduate school."
23588,best car racing video game,This and 3. Finishing all three regions in TXR3 took me a week to complete (not including the wanderers).
70882,best movies with a cool twist,"What's the twist? There's no mindfuck, it's just (absurdly) complicated."
70960,best movies with a cool twist,Sleepaway Camp.
44624,best items under $100,"Better than shit kitchen utensils. Upgrading from Ikea to Oxo is a night and day difference and saves time in meal prep. 

A SAD light...if anything it wakes you up well in the am as you start working. 

Monitor risers, if you don't have height adjustable monitors these help a lot

10ft phone charging cable. 

Over $100:

A good winter jacket changed my shit forever. I bought a top line Helly Hansen winter jack and I now take way more walks no matter the -20 or -30 days. 

A deluxe pillow. They last longer and change your sleep forever."
36093,best alcoholic drink,Drinking Sazeracs is what changed my mind on licorice. Now I'm a big fan.
13152,best gifts for mom,"My mom always goes for purfume, lotion, candles, or just pictures of family."
6489,best Netflix documentary,"Jiro Dreams of Sushi was oddly entertaining, it is about a sushi chef who is absolutely dedicated to what he does, and nears perfection.

I think what makes it so interesting has nothing to do with Sushi, but consistency and striving for perfection."
71006,best movies with a cool twist,Orphan from what year?
11877,best gifts for dad,"My dad's never had an ice cream cake, so I'm getting him one specially made with teaberry ice cream(one of his favorites)."
61726,Best RPG game on PS4,"Well, I didn't downvote you and I literally mentioned that Horizon has RPG elements and is the closest game to being one in my previous comment."
42427,movies like Inception,Watchmen. The novel was better but Dr. Manhattan's soliloquy about life and time in the movie still had an everlasting impression.
