60224,"Yesiree -- boil the stock first then put into jars and then into your pressure canner.  If you have no solids in the stock, then it's 30 minutes per pint at 10lbs pressure and 35 minutes per quart at 10lbs pressure.

If you make chicken soup with solids in it, then it's 50 minutes per pint and 55 minutes per quart.  But I find it's better to can the stock and then make the soup with it using fresh vegetables.  

That's all there is to it.  

The ""secret"" is to buy the largest pressure canner you can afford and make a whole bunch of stock.  You can stack the jars one on top of each other in the canner using racks.  

Use your canned stock within the year.  Although, I have used stock that's two years old without a problem but do as I say, not as I do.",best freezer brand
