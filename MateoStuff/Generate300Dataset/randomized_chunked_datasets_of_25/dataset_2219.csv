54423,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hello all!

I currently own the top 5 artisans out there...

Zero, 
Hayate Otsu v2, 
Hien, 
Raiden, 
Shidenkai

The Raiden and shidenkai are mid and the others are soft. I have used zero xsoft and otsu xsoft as well as mid so I have a good idea of a lot of softness variation.

In descending order...

Speed - shidenkai, Raiden, hien, otsu v2, zero

Control - zero, otsu v2, hien, Raiden, shidenkai

That seems opposite, and it is, but not quite that black and white. For instance, otsu v2 is just about as fast as hien and as much control as zero, that's why it's so popular! 

In terms of durability, they're all insane minus the shidenkai. I've owned zero and hien the longest (about 5 months) and they're still nearly new! Granted, I rotate pads a lot, but no joke they just don't wear down! The otsu v2 I've owned for about 3 months and it also feels brand new! I'm guessing they fixed the otsu v1 issues. Raiden and shidenkai are the newest. I've had them about a month, Raiden seems like it will last forever. Shidenkai does get a few stray bead shards from time to time so I imagine it will wear down faster than the others, but I used it for two weeks straight and it still basically feels brand new. 

Some other notes... 

Otsu v2 has the most comfortable surface, it's really unique. Shidenkai is probably the most fun, so smooth! Raiden is very soft and I've had no spinouts (800 dpi and I've used 7 different new mice on it). Zero does get hair stuck in it from time to time and a lint roller works great. Hien is better broken in a bit. 

Soft is my favorite density, xsoft is great if you like a tad more control, mid is best for the fast pads (Raiden and shidenkai). 

Ordering from their website is very easy, I can walk anyone through it if needed. 

I use a Logi GPX SL, XM1R, Xtrfy M42, Hati S, Viper mini, and HyperX Pulsefire Haste in rotation on these pads and every combo has been amazing! 

Any other questions, don't hesitate to ask! I spent a ton of money so might as well share the knowledge!"

60178,best freezer brand,"9 years on mine, it froze over pretty bad but we caught it and thawed it out and added the bigger drain clip on the heating element before the ice ate up the evaporator fan.  Same that the local appliance shop told me ""good luck finding someone that can fix a Samsung"" last time I was browsing there for a washer and dryer and mentioned my Samsung fridge."
54067,best medicine for a cold,"I eat ramen, drink lots of water, overmedicate, and sleep.  Any possible time I can be sleeping I curl up in my bed and sleep.  I think just letting my body fight it without giving it anything else to do helps a lot."

70444,best major to study in college,"Elementary Education

Best: I get paid to have fun and be goofy. I love doing something meaningful. I truly believe kids are our future. 

Worst: “ThOsE wHo CaNt Do, TeACh! HaHAhAhAhA!”
But for real, people shit on teachers in the US. They claim to be all about them and support them, but they aren’t. I especially get crap for wanting to teach young kids and being male."

65375,best phone service company,Where I live it does. Not even close. I've had all of the big 3. ATT is pretty good but has worse reception or no reception where Verizon will have 3 or 4 bars. T-mobile is a joke here.

If Nixon hadn't devolved into a paranoid mess who authorized criminal activity, he was actually a pretty good one and would have a good rep otherwise."
