Douglas Fir. They remind me of my hometown.
Ginos!
"Sounds like he’s really nice, but overwhelmed with the accidental stardom. I don’t blame him. I’d be the same way after years of that."
"Ah yes, one of the other reasons I don’t go to Lowe’s.  Lowe’s craftsman always confuses me. I see red and I’m like “woohoo milwaukee!”  Then I get closer and am disappointed"
I just picked up The Flaw of Averages by Sam Savage. Its a pretty interesting read from the statistics side.
i have 2 of these and they're wonderful.
"I also feel like this curve matches the big boom of new players that happened 5ish years ago.  There are a ton of fantastic pre-2016 games that often don't appear on these lists because so many people are trying to get through the list of games that are still in print and easily findable at the stores.  I mean, who will want to review a classic that's been 10 years out of print that no one can track down without paying a premium?

Overall though, this is a solid list that I feel does a better job than BGG at showing quality of a game than popularity of a game."
"Adam Curtis' essay-as-documentary **HyperNormalization** is prescient and informative.

We loved this show!
"I'm planning on retiring to the Finger Lakes...But if you only could visit one, I'd tell you visit NYC. But if you visit 2 places, check out the Finger Lakes."
"I used to love the show when it was first airing. I was ecstatically waiting for the release of the episodes but when the big reveal happened I kinda felt empty. Don't get me wrong, it's a great show with a unique premise and great animation and music, but the reveal didn't feel as big for me. I still get sad over it."
Every time out of Orlando....
a waterfall shower head. Even if your water pressure is on the lower side it works really well and you wont have most of the water dripping down in a big mess while one overzealous stream is stinging you

"Nice. I'm into my third year, myself."

That tends to happen when you play 20 years. Look at Favre
"Taylor Swift - met her after the 1989 show in my city. Super nice and easy to talk to, felt like we were old friends. But what was crazy was she knew the guy standing next to me just from Tumblr (this was back when she used it a lot and he ran a TSwift fan tumblr). She knew his name, knew all these personal details about him and was really excited to meet him! It was very sweet."
"Graphic design major

Best: I love developing new ideas and flexing my creativity. Potential career field is looking pretty good. The major allows me to develop my portfolio with guidance from my professors. Rarely take tests or quizzes.

Worst: Professors grading your work can be pretty subjective. ""Oh, so you're an art major."" Also you either pay for Adobe Creative Cloud yourself or you go to the library all the time to get work done."
