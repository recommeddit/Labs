That's like two months.
Michigan is an amazing place and you should definitely move here. Especially the upper peninsula. There's no place like it on earth.
I’m sure if they could they wouldn’t recommend anything that would be helpful and would recommend stuff that rots your teeth so they get more business and more money.
Thanks for the feedback.. I ended up going with a place near playa del carmen Mexico for a great deal.. it seems to offer exactly what we want!

Performance > Build Quality > Battery Life > Aesthetics. I was eyeing the Lenovo Thinkpad E15 Gen 2 (AMD) but it seems those are sold out at that budget. Thank you."

Male genitalia. Pale skin would also be up there.
"Closys is excellent, a chlorine based mouthwash."
I'm with you. I like VS code but was already more familiar with atom and didn't feel like switching.
Just started The Boys and it is DEFINETELY worth the hype
"Among my favorite in a recent decade:

* *Arrival*

* *Parasite*

* *Invitation*"
"The last time I was this excited for an MCU film (that wasn't an Avengers film) was *Doctor Strange*, and that ended up being my #12 MCU film, so I learned a hard lesson. *Shang-Chi* just outclassed it in every way - the narrative, the villain, the foils, the humour, the imagination, the *heart*.

My only two gripes with *Shang-Chi* were minor, and they related to pacing and the under-development of Razorfist, particularly the missed opportunity to position him more explicitly against Shang-Chi as Wenwu's ""adopted"" son. Alternately, I quite enjoyed that the ""family"" aspect which elevated so much of the emotional complexity of this film (and particularly its villain) was contained within the four main roles of the family. 

So, my first gripe is forgivable and the second will likely be explored/developed in a sequel. I really can't complain too much at all.

Shang-Chi is my new #3."
"I feel like I’m tied between Reign White Gummy bear, Razzle Berry, Orange dreamsicle, and 4 out of the 5 Ghost flavors (citrus is nearly identical to Bang Cherry Blade Lemonade and Sprite)"
"They make an attachment for dick use.

Just an FYI."
It's true but that's not how the rankings work. Everyone knows fifa rankings really don't reflect quality.
That's why it's my favourite film of all time. I watched it with my classmate and damn we were in shock for two days..
"Upvoted for Vince.

Bummer.
Me too! If Mulan can fight save China I can probably do another 10 minutes.
Rabbits be vicious.
Really? I've heard he was a dick. But I'll take your word for it. I bet he is funny.
"My mom loves books. Crime, mystery,  thriller, sci-fi. I usually can't go wrong if I get her some good fiction."
