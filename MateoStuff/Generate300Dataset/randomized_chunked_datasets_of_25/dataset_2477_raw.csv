"I've got the 27gl850-B and can vouch for it.
Also why the series X if you've already got a PC? All exclusives are cross platform and Xbox controllers intrinsically work automatically on windows."
"He's had his fair share of movies where he romances girls 20+ years younger than him, he was more or less forced to transition."
I simply attach a small explosive to the opening mechanism so if someone tried to open it they are in for a rude awakening.
"I want a medium size Hayate Otsu. The only thing stopping me from pulling the trigger is the xsoft versus soft. What is the real difference between the two? Does Xsoft sink in with regular pressure? I don't think I want my wrist to noticeably depress into the pad, but I do want it to be comfortable.

To be clear, I don't even use a mouspad right now. I play on the wood surface of my desk. I also use 4400 dpi and don't want to make large movements with my hand, if that helps."
"That's my concern with trying it.  I tried to watch the Netflix series and couldn't get into it at all, so I figure I might not like the game either"
"That's exactly it.  It's to keep away lazy thieves.  It's the same principle with car locks, door and window locks on your home, and security software on your phone and computer.  The thief who knows what they're doing will have absolutely zero issue with those deterrents but a less than ambitious one will probably say fuck it and move on to the next one."
my dog hands down
Where in the Adirondacks is this at? My wife and I are planning a trip there next summer to do some backpacking and car camping.
I pretend that the ending of the last book doesn't exist. Otherwise it's all great ðŸ™‚
This question gets asked all the time
Have you played 2-player? Thinking of getting it to play with my wife once we exhaust Gloomhaven.
"I picture him saying that in his usual pooh bear voice 

Un-acs-sept-a-bub-bul"
PARIS TEXAS
"the only prob with Always Sunny is that the first two seasons aren't funny but you kinda need them to understand the rest of the show.

but if you understand the character dynamic then seasons 3 and onward are the funniest shit you'll ever see"
Caje is a name I haven't heard in a loooong time.
"""Story of God"" and ""The Story of Us"", both with Morgan Freeman. Having Freeman is reason enough to watch, but he goes and explores other cultures and learns how they view and navigate their world. They're some of my favorite documentaries ever"
The Departed.
"Ice Mountain. Any spring water brand is amazing but Ice Mountain is just..refreshing.

P.S. Dasani sucks ass. It tastes like the bottle."
No doubt.
"I wouldn't even mind if the whole back is as thick as the 4. that's more space for more features, though I think they did their best to balance between features and thickness on this release"
I was just thinking of Hannibal today. I still canâ€™t believe that itâ€™s real. Gods it was just so good.
"New Hampshire. Drive up 93 into the white Mountains. Then do the Kangamagus Highway. Bonus points for the perfect autumn day. 

Eat at Pollys Pancake Parlor for our regional food showcase, lol, maple syrup. Seriously though, they serve your pancakes a few at a time so you keep getting fresh pancakes. They also come with maple syrup, sugar, butter and creme. It's a hilarious treat with a phenomenal view."
Love that guy.
Kim's Convenience.
How does this album sound so ***classic***?
