There are Chrome extensions, but they get it wrong when undoing closed tabs (ctrl+shift+t), thinking that's a new tab and moving it to the end instead of opening where it was closed.  Firefox does ""tabs at the end"" correctly, too, but I prefer Chromium's rendering and extensions.",best web browser

I'm looking to upgrade to an artisan soon. I've mostly used the CorsairMM300 for 2 years and the g640 for a  it over a year. I like the control of both but I definitely want a bit more speed while keeping some control since I play some tracking oriented games too (Val/Apex)
