Insert English muffin, egg. cheese, Canadian bacon, and extras to taste (I like yum-yum sauce on mine). They also make a [dual version](https://www.hamiltonbeach.com/dual-breakfast-sandwich-maker-25490)."
51398,best iphone case,"I don't really care about aesthetics, so I just go for the toughest case I can find. Usually Otterbox or Mous"
17356,best iOS game,Worst rating list in this galaxy
19527,best YouTube video,"The best thing about them is they have something for everyone. If you want to watch shit movies get ripped apart, they have that (Best of the Worst). If you want to watch in-depth reviews of some of your favourites, they have that (re;View). If you just want contemporary reviews to find out if a movie is worth spending your money on, they have that too (Half in the Bag).

And... if you want to watch a 116 year-old serial killer with an addiction to pizza rolls bitch about Star Wars, you have that too (Mr. Plinkett)."
25481,best cricket teams of all time,The one surprising fact is that Azharuddin's India had a better LOI win-loss ratio than Ganguly's India.
54828,best water filter,"Couple drops per liter.  I'd shake it up for a bit, lit it sit a few minutes then open it up.  If you smell faint chlorine smell then you are good to go, if you don't it is likely that you haven't fully inactivated everything in the water, so repeat the process. 

The smell of the chlorine is a good sign because it means everything that can be inactivated, is likely inactivated. I will say that this isn't full proof either.  Certain spores and viruses are resistant to chlorination, but I feel this is a good enough precaution in emergency situations."
39342,best web browser,"This is the right choice for exactly one reason -- it's the only Chromium-based browser that properly implements ""tabs at the end"".  There are Chrome extensions, but they get it wrong when undoing closed tabs (ctrl+shift+t), thinking that's a new tab and moving it to the end instead of opening where it was closed.  Firefox does ""tabs at the end"" correctly, too, but I prefer Chromium's rendering and extensions."
7315,best iPhone,"Oh yeah, androids are cool for that. I had another phone that was 21:9 (Sony Xperia 1) really slick phone :P"
2098,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Honestly it’s blaze for me. $10 will get me enough toppings to make the pizza last two meals and it’s delicious imo
26350,best politician,I voted for Jumbo
72612,best keyboard switches,"Zilent v2 @ 67g, really love the way the feel with the amount of force and tactility while being quiet enough for the office. Only downside for me was price and time lubing, but I didn't join r/mk to be rational with a keeb."
57605,best cologne,This is why Tommy Boy is my daily.
10095,best pencil for drawing,Black prismacolor on news print is great for practice. Use a better archival paper for refined work.

29469,best game console,"How was The Last Remnant?  It has some pretty iffy reviews, but it's constantly on sale on steam."
53642,best medicine for a cold,"I just want to add, to reduce the amount of people getting sick:

Cough and sneeze into your elbow, NOT YOUR HANDS.

DO NOT go to work if you are sick, *especially* if you work with the public."
54523,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hey! First thanks for the review!

I'm looking to upgrade to an artisan soon. I've mostly used the CorsairMM300 for 2 years and the g640 for a  it over a year. I like the control of both but I definitely want a bit more speed while keeping some control since I play some tracking oriented games too (Val/Apex)

Would be using it with my viper mini (tiger ace 1 feet and paracorded with a bungee)

Would the zero or hien fit the bill? In soft or mid?"

71951,best movies with a cool twist,"The house in Ex Machina is actually a hotel; a stay in 2019 (they close December 1 for the rest of 2018) will cost you \~$360 USD a night for a landscape view.

40358,best midrange GPU,I think the RX 580 and the GTX 1060 6GB perform similar but you can find the RX580 a bit cheaper. But the GTX 1060 is more power efficent while the the RX580 (and all the other AMD GPUs) have Freesync. Freesync monitors are way cheaper than G-Sync monitors which is the Nvidia equivalent of AMDs Freesync.
73213,best Linux distro,"Either Ubuntu or Fedora. Fedora has the best package manager, Ubuntu has the best games support and larger community base."
