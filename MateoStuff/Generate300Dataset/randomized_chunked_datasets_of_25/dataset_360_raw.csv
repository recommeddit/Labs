"I agree with your point about encouraging people to make a smaller purchase to get their feet wet, actually. Specifically I find that for some high end gear, while it may sound great to the right listener, can be utterly offensive to anyone else. Everyone raves about the Beyer dt1350 but I found it to have textureless 'sausage slapping' bass, bodyless mids, piercing highs and terrible sound separation/soundstage. I find that cheaper, value oriented products are usually tuned to have a much more 'inoffensive' sound that they can be easily enjoyed by almost anyone, no matter their tastes for sound.

I also disagree with the criticism that this cheaper gear gets thrown away when the user inevitably upgrades. I still have my PL50s and my Clip Zip, the first pieces of specialty audio equipment that I purchased, and I still make regular use of them. Other entry level headphones (though maybe not so much IEMs) can become handmedows to friends or family who you would like to introduce to the hobby, or even modding playgrounds to show you exactly what makes a headphone sound the way it sounds, and give you an opportunity to tune them to your own two ears in a way that no manufacturer ever could."
"BTW, is there an ad network that specializes in China? My game has lots of users there for some reason."
"Same,
When is said ' it's not as good as people say it is'
I meant in comparison to the other MCU movies"

Fat Ray been out for years… his album with Black Milk in 2007 is incredible
It just came out recently but Slitherman Activated by RXK Nephew has got to be what I've enjoyed the most so far this year.
"Dale Earnhardt Sr. It was 1995 and I was 6 years old. My parents were big NASCAR fans and entered me into contest to sit in his car while we drove (slowly) around the track, there were about 15-20 drivers doing this. 

The plan was to make two laps around and then we were done for the day, they were staggering them to make sure each driver had plenty of space. 

Dale was cool, asking me a bunch of questions, and when our second lap ended and the guy was waving him in, Dale just punched it and went right around him. He did this the second time around too, we almost rear ended another driver as they were starting the lap.

I stopped watching NASCAR the day he died. Was never the biggest fan of the ""sport"", but I always needed to cheer for him."
"Maryland.

I'd recommend visiting the Maryland Heights Trail that overlooks Harpers Ferry WV when the leaves are changing colors. Exceptionally scenic. Yes, you're overlooking WV and VA but the trail itself is entirely in MD.

Pictures don't really do it justice."
"Depending on where you go. In Illinois, TMobile is terrible.  If I travel to DeKalb about 1.5 hours west of downtown Chicago, I lose cellphone signal.  When we traveled to Waterloo Iowa, I literally lost cell phone signal from DeKalb until we got back to DeKalb. In short, Verizon was a necessity for me because T-Mobile was literally costing me too much money for my business with how much cell phone service died out unless you were within one hour of downtown Chicago"
"""I understand that you NEED money"""
"Anyone who's actually played a table-top RPG would never argue that Soulsborne are RPGs. It's not even debatable. They have character creation, stats, leveling, equipment, treasure discovery, looting, bartering, NPC quests, lore, character classes, and dungeon crawling. RPG is not and never will be synonymous with turned-based."

"I loved Hyperion, but hated the Endymion books that are sort of a sequel. IMHO, they retro-actively lessen the first book."
"I find reading 3 star, or the average reviews, most helpful. They aren't too extreme about either and give a balanced view of pros and cons."
"Anker uses quality cells and I've been happy with mine...however all batteries degrade over time so really there's no BIFL solution yet, but Anker is a good bet for a solid product."
"MSFT IIPR DIS STEM CHPT VTI, & ASTS (That's 7, sorry). A good mix of disruption, innovation, growth, dividend, and risk. Cheers!"
"I’m from western PA, I had to google what a mars bar is.  I have for sure never gotten them at halloween.  I just asked my husband if he has ever had one and he said no, he doesn’t even know what the package looks like, so I think this map is wrong.

Editing to say I just searched it so maybe that’s why it’s number one in PA because everyone has to google it lol"
"Shot in the Dark is so good and IMO, underwatched. When the twin has to go save someone from a burning car...shit, I did not expect that to affect him so much after and almost take him out of the game. Scott is a douche but he’s effective at really getting the good shots"
"Not relevant, epub and pdf are universal."
Have you all seen High Life yet?  >!that spaghettification (human through black hole and her body explodes) scene stuck with me for a long time.!<
"Can vouch for the first two, played both and they’re amazing. Thronebreaker captures that feeling of exploration (gotta clear the map clean!) while Crying Suns is straight up Battlestar Galactica fantasies."
"We call this ""The Dead Freshman."""
"I really don't have a favorite. SpaceFM is nice.

As for CLI file manager's. I guess I do have two favorite ones. Which are ranger and nnn."
"Yeah, this list is worthless. There's a lot on here that really have no right to be here, and there's a lot that aren't on here that really should be.

No Black Sabbath.

No Red Hot Chili Peppers.

No Gorillaz. 

No Aerosmith, REO Speedwagon, ELO(Missing a lot of very monumental classic rock overall)

I'd probably put Broken Bells somewhere in here as well.

Yet they filled the list with crap. Kanye(I mean I liked some of Graduation, but there's much better artists), Amy Winehouse... Honestly, as important as the Sex Pistols were, and however much I like them, it was a pretty terrible album overall. Not #38 material. 

The author very obviously has a lot of bias as well... I think I saw 4 or 5  Smiths albums, including the one he put in 1st. 

...and I just noticed Ill Communication as the first Beastie Boys album listed... really?

Edit: The hell, guys? If you're going to downvote me, at least say something! It's about discussion. I'm in the negatives, and the only comment I've gotten was agreeing. Got a problem? Let's talk."
"Heck, I'd have seconds and then polish it off with a tall, cool Budweiser!"
