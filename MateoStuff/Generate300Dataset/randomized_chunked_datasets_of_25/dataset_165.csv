54316,"Or don't catch one to begin with?  Since I started _religiously_ washing hands when in public: before touching my face, rubbing eyes, touching mouth or eating...  Also not touching any possibly dirty (with viruses) surfaces after washing hands and before eating.  Cold viruses can remain viable for a short period of time on door knobs, keyboards, and other surfaces (like several hours). Also if you are around a visibly sick person, be cautious with touching objects and surfaces they touched before you eat or touch your mouth/nose/eyes.

She's some kind of food physicist or something and in addition to her cooking and baking videos, she also posts videos debunking the clickbait videos from the content farms like Yummy or 5 minute crafts. Recently she posted a video debunking some misinformation about the corona virus. It's the only Youtube channel I regularly watch and she's definitely worth checking out.

Otherwise, something to make her feel beautiful and like a woman rather than a mom would be good. A trip to a salon to have her hair cut/dyed/styled, her brows done, and a manicure is always nice. A shopping trip to her favourite store, so she can get herself some new clothes (she's probably not quite the same shape/size as her pre-kid body!), would likely also go over well. Sign her up for a class, something in the evenings when you'll be home to watch the baby - is there something she's always wanted to learn, like art or music or dance?

I was at my local supermarket/post office and had just paid for my groceries, then I went over to the post office section which is ~3 meters further away. 30 seconds later a woman was about to pay for her stuff, when she asked the cashier: ""is it you who smell so amazing?"", cashier said ""no, can't possibly be me"", she said ""oh, it just smells soooo heavenly in here!!! are you sure it's not you?"", he rplied with ""haha, nope, I don't have a fragrance on"", then she just said ""oh, well it smells fantastic here"". my mother was standing behind her and could tell it was my fragrance.

Also, use a bucket and grid instead of a tray and grid, much easier and cleaner

15466,"How do you remedy alkaline? Elemental sulfur and composted mulch? That can help, but for trees they generally wouldn't do well, since you'll have to reapply elemental sulfur (if not mulch as well) every other year or so, and you'll have to increase the area of application to account for the growth of the root zone. 

By suburban, I mean alkaline and droughty soil. Ace rub is a floodplain species with a definite preference for spring flooding, and stresses without it.
