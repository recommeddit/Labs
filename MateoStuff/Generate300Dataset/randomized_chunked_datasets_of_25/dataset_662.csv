NT managers cannot make as much of an impact on the field due to time, so their selection is crucial. And his selection of players sucks. He's just not getting fired because the DFB is a corrupt nepotistic douchebag clan who are all in bed with each other and think they're tough sh*t because they get to choose some of the best players in the world and think it's part of their achievement that these guys are so good.",best soccer team in the world

That does over simplify things a bit, but at the end of the day the US saw a clear path to securing possibly the best geographical position that a country could ever ask for and decided it would be a damn fool move to not take advantage of the situation.",best Mexican war to study

I'm new to reddit... :) 
Still learning my way around.

> ... I'd argue it's a better dev experience with axios.

If you need upload progress, Axios might be still inarguably better. 

Honestly I still use Axios, just less and less (as compatibility gets better.)

I included the pattern to let people know it's possible (most devs I talked to were surprised to find download progress was possible w/ fetch - myself included). 

I will include more compatibility info - and general guidance: I only used it in a project which had already been built on native fetch, adding a 3rd party library for progress updates was something I wanted to avoid...",axios alternatives reddit
