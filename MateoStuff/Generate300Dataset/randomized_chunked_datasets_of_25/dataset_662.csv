66395,best soccer team in the world,"He has been horrendous since 2018. Before that he was quite alright, but I think that was more thanks to the Bayern core that he could rely on. NT managers cannot make as much of an impact on the field due to time, so their selection is crucial. And his selection of players sucks. He's just not getting fired because the DFB is a corrupt nepotistic douchebag clan who are all in bed with each other and think they're tough sh*t because they get to choose some of the best players in the world and think it's part of their achievement that these guys are so good."
8864,best toothpaste,Spread the knowledge! I swear if you used the amount shown in commercials you'd be buying a new tube once a month or sooner
68190,best science fiction novel,Count Zero is so good. Yeah I liked it more than Nueromancer too.
30127,best Mexican war to study,"To be honest, for the time, it was a perfectly unremarkable war of conquest. They were not rare at the time and were kind of just how things were done. That does over simplify things a bit, but at the end of the day the US saw a clear path to securing possibly the best geographical position that a country could ever ask for and decided it would be a damn fool move to not take advantage of the situation."

10509,best suitcase lock,Are you staying with strangers?
8328,best toothpaste,"Light force is all that’s required. It’s the back and forth motion that does the work, not the force.

If you brush too hard it cause gum recession which exposes the dentine, and this is temperature sensitive. Gum recession is irreversible.

If you use a good electric toothbrush it’ll go into low power mode if you push too hard. The right force doesn’t feel like much."
18705,best YouTube video,Crash Course. The US and World History playlists in particular are great for binging.
62211,Best RPG game on PS4,"According to Australia, Detroit is an RPG. 

I’d say they fit the definition well enough."

63104,Best online React course,"I have taken Stephen Griders, and Maxmillian Schwarzmullers, and they are probably the best two on Udemy? Griders edges it for me. However, they can be a struggle at times due to the sheer delving into every minute detail. It can make the learning process tiresome. Often something relatively simple will take 3 lectures? (useState) In all honesty you are probably better off learning from YouTube

And reading the docs."
67987,best science fiction novel,"If you want to keep OSC on there, but think Ender's Game is too juvenile, the obvious choice is Speaker for the Dead. Personally, I leave Ender's Game on there. The fact that it involves children is part of what makes it great. And I don't see how Ender's Shadow (another excellent book) is anymore grown-up. It is a parallel novel. Very interesting, but pretty much the same kind of book"
73613,best battery bank,"Yeah that was in my shortlist because its close, all out was missing was maximum output power. It can charge my laptop but at 2/3 speed"
35901,best alcoholic drink,"You can mix sparkling water (i use a sodastream to carbonate plain water...or you could use a flavored or unflavored Lacroix) with vodka. If you go with an unflavored water you throw in a splash of lime or lemon juice. Simple, no sugar beyond what may be in the vodka or lime juice, and it'll get you drunk if you so wish."
12590,best gifts for mom,"My dad leaves me ""hey it's me at [TIME]. Call me back."" Voicemails for everything if I don't answer. I'm not sure if he realizes that I can see when and what time he called. So I'll call him back and it'll be just some casual question that coild be a text or a thing he saw or whatever. Never anything important. 

But I'll always listen to them even if I know exactly what it is, because one day, he won't be leaving them anymore."
67442,axios alternatives reddit,"Thanks for the reply.

I'm new to reddit... :) 
Still learning my way around.

> ... I'd argue it's a better dev experience with axios.

If you need upload progress, Axios might be still inarguably better. 

Honestly I still use Axios, just less and less (as compatibility gets better.)

I included the pattern to let people know it's possible (most devs I talked to were surprised to find download progress was possible w/ fetch - myself included). 

I will include more compatibility info - and general guidance: I only used it in a project which had already been built on native fetch, adding a 3rd party library for progress updates was something I wanted to avoid..."
11548,best gifts for dad,"It's actually true. There are some projects for 3D printers which are made in a way that you can print a large portion of the parts yourself. 

Of course the expensive parts are going to be circuits and electronics and for a high-end printer you'd want aluminium anyway, but it's still a good idea."
69868,best major to study in college,"Pro: Post college options

Cons: Tons of homework"
30276,best Mexican war to study,It basically treated as either a completely boring war for land or a righteous godly war and the epitome of manifest destiny. At least in highschool for me.
61703,Best RPG game on PS4,Ni no kuni 2 is 85% off right now in ps store. Maybe check and see if that interests ya.
