Very interesting. So it might not have been just a case of SA losing so much but also other teams having a bunch of wins?
The cast of Corner gas. Saw a few of them at o'hanolan's in Regina and also saw Brent Butt at south BPs. Good times.
Ill definitely check that out. The reason why I use vscode for debugging is its ability to debug typescript. I use typescript in all my projects and it doesn't look like there is a debugger for typescript in vim. I could debug the javascript generated but that would be annoying
Nah the snap pack is not practical for college use
"To the extent that any media can be genuinely neutral, [the Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/) comes the closest, no contest. It's won ~8 Pulitzer Prizes for a reason! 

Other than that, I think understanding local media ecosystems is important (which papers are aligned with who, and so on). [Media Bias Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) can help for that. There isn't really a one-size-fits-all source out there that can handle every subject and region well, though.

But to be honest, I think that foreign policy think tanks tend to produce better coverage than newspapers. Newspapers want simplistic narratives that can be followed easily by readers and headlines that get clicks. :P"

"[Most likely this one.](https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/dell-27-gaming-monitor-s2716dg/apd/210-agjr/monitors-flat-screen-lcd-computer-displays)

I actually just picked one up myself for my GTX 1080 and I love it! Absolutely fantastic monitor. 

It's a TN panel which means relatively worse colours and viewing angle shenanigans, but the colours are still vastly improved over my previous monitors so I have zero complaints."
How bug was your kitchen and how much were the cabinets?
"Oh I agree 100%, I've met people who absolutely hated it but, they only played chapter two and then stopped. OP, this game has an amazing story aspect. I won't spoil anything but it's awe inspiring how well it's put together. I do agree though, you need to spend quite a bit of time with it."
ah ok so 480p
its not guaranteed to work. google has google labs and not everyone of those were successful.
What is your evidence for US universities scoring higher than they should? Wishful thinking?
"I don't think MEAN is a good fit for what you describe at all.

To make an informed decision yourself, understand what does each letter stand for, especially the NoSQL (Mongo) part. Also, check out the third party libraries/modules/whatever you will need and compare the maturity of the ones created for Node (MEAN) and Django/Python. This is really important.

It's exciting to work with new technology but it isn't necessarily the best choice. If you have little time, go with the safest option even if it's boring."
"I'd go slightly bigger if you have the space in your house/apartment/bunker/etc- chest freezers can be super useful to store other foods you get on sale like meat or fish or frozen pizza or ice cream or basically anything that you eat often that occasionally is on sale for far less than the average price.  I've never said ""I wish my freezer was smaller.""  I have a small household and a 15 ish cubic foot freezer, but that's likely more than you need unless you're a weirdo like me who does a lot of freezer cooking and bulk buys.

In my area 3.5 cu foot freezer are in the low $200 range and 7.0 are in the high $200 range, to me upsizing would be reasonable if you're not crunched for space."
I'm surprised no one mentioned Chris D'Elia. His stand-up and podcast are hilarious.
I had a tesla try to keep up in my gasoline car let's just say I'll never be buying one after seeing how a tesla can lose power going a decent speed for a long time.. shoot I've never had that problem in my gasoline powered car lol.. just having pure hate haha
Pretty sure it was just a joke
">In this sub, I have encountered some resistance to the comic book medium. Surprisingly, as I would have thought readers of sci-fi to be more receptive to marginalised media.

It's simple; comic books are extremely expensive in terms of plot/$ compared to novels, they are also hard to find at libraries and don't work well with e-readers."
"I worked at the premier hotel in my town so I've met quite a few:

Bill Cosby- was nice and made conversation

Prince: pissed off because we said he couldn't smoke in the room. He then tried to bribe us.

Patrick Warburton: nice but really tired looking. 

Ringo: still wants to be popular and will do his best to remind you of it.

Mayweather: was really nice, TV seems to make him more mouth than what he is. He does have like 30 people that ride with him though.

Seal: Quiet doesn't say much and just wanted to go to sleep.

Donald Trump: very business and his body guards dont play. Had to send two employees home at the order of secret service.

Usher: Went to his room and saw to girls sleeping at the door. He turned around and told us he would ne sleeping in his bus.

Larry Holmes: a has been that wants free rooms and can't accept that the world has left him.

Malcome of malcome in the middle: really nice and didn't look like he had aged any.

Kesha: I delivered the message table and she answered in a towel. She was really sweet but doesn't tip.

Wayne Gretzky: a insufferable asshole that his wife had to keep apologizing for his bad attitude.

Richard Karn of home Improvement: Really nice and way down to earth.

Larry the cable guy: He actually told his security to back down so he could see his fans.

Wwe: these guys are very well behaved and very professional.

Dana Carvey: was very chill checking in and even did a Garth impression from Wayne's World without us asking.

Minor soap stars can be the worst: several females with minor roles will constantly say ""I'm an actress"" when ever asking for specific stuff.

Jesse Jackson: Always has to be in the presidential, request massage therapist at odd hours and remains very professional at checking in.

Ben Stein: Does not talk really slow and is actually a great tipper. very polite and he bought my girlfriend waffles because she had to work late at the hotel.

I'll add or answer questions as I go."
"Videogames, neat nerdy pins, gift cards, fantasy novels, gift cards to Amazon or Nintendo...  Whiskey..."
Sakana sushi. That place is better than the sushi I find in Japan.
This is the last time Watson and Crick were modest about anything.
VEGETA LOOK...............a Pok√©mon
"It doesn't help that barely anything has changed structure-wise in our football since like, the 90s. Add the ever-persistent criminal presence in our football into the equation and it gets even worse. We literally only rely on raw talent to get by, and I think that our inadequacies in terms of development and coaching will keep biting us in the ass more ferociously with each following qualification cycle."
Clear Spigen so I can admire the sierra blue for the first few months. Then probably something super low profile for long term
