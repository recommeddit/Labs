61049,"West Wing. Excellent writing and dialogue. Characters exchange rapid-fire remarks and debate with each other on a highly intellectual level, but not so high you can't keep up. It has the element of believability to it too (that I think a lot of shows that tried to impersonate this one lacked) because the characters are all Ivy League graduates working in the fast paced world of politics, at the White House no less, these are professionals at th top of their game.   Also good because the writer of the series, Aaron Sorkin, doesn't rely on seven layers of snark and sarcasm or three pop-culture references per sentence to make his dialogue appear ""smart""', like some shows do.

Over the years I upgraded to the C920, although, i’m not big on streaming, its actually a very professional option used by many studios for video work, including company I work for. If you’re into filmmaking, its the choice of professionals, i’ve used it for a few projects, great quality, but very expensive for a hobby.
