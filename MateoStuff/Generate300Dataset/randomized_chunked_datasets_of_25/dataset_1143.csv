34596,best NFL player,"Rich Gannon was pretty solid too, won an MVP. Rice @ 40 led the Raiders in receiving that year though, so I imagine he deserves some credit for that MVP nod lol"
3086,best webcamera,"I trade stocks so I occasionally watch CNBC/bloomberg/etc.

Even their Cisco/Zoom feeds go to garbage depending on the internet. CEOs everywhere.

And it's been a while since COVID now. They just don't care to upgrade their internet or fix shit.

Being billionaires, you would think they would fix it or get dedicated lines. Nope."

25464,best cricket teams of all time,"> Bradman is a weird one.

There is one clear thing in common with every cricket fan I see questioning Bradman's legacy. 

I'm not sure why you guys over there have such a bee in your bonnet about Bradman."
61049,Best comedy show on Netflix,"West Wing. Excellent writing and dialogue. Characters exchange rapid-fire remarks and debate with each other on a highly intellectual level, but not so high you can't keep up. It has the element of believability to it too (that I think a lot of shows that tried to impersonate this one lacked) because the characters are all Ivy League graduates working in the fast paced world of politics, at the White House no less, these are professionals at th top of their game.   Also good because the writer of the series, Aaron Sorkin, doesn't rely on seven layers of snark and sarcasm or three pop-culture references per sentence to make his dialogue appear ""smart""', like some shows do. Looking at you Gilmore Girls..."

67180,axios alternatives reddit,"+1 for Axios. Though, I have read good things about got such as it’s http2 support that Axios isn’t planning to add. However, one of my main motivations for choosing Axios is the huge community surrounding it. Try them both out and choose whichever better suits your needs!"

3374,best webcamera,"True, I started out with a very very cheap webcam from the 2000’s era, kinda just put together what I had. Over the years I upgraded to the C920, although, i’m not big on streaming, its actually a very professional option used by many studios for video work, including company I work for. If you’re into filmmaking, its the choice of professionals, i’ve used it for a few projects, great quality, but very expensive for a hobby. And a total waste if its going to collect dust"

73835,best matte screen protector for ipad,I know the distorted screen might be annoying but fingerprints all over the screen would annoy me even more. It’s especially weird trying use your pencil over fingerprints. Matte doesn’t have that issue. There are matte “tempered glass” ones that I’m looking to get. The paper like one ruins the pencil tip too quickly and the screen protectors gets scuffed bug the pencil tip too based on the reviews I’ve seen.

24156,best anime,"Full metal alchemist both original and brotherhood watch both

Mushi-shi:a relaxing series that has the first season on Netflix and the second and the interseries episode is on crunchyroll and ongoing

Magi though I have to say that it starts out not super well so some people don't keep watching but if you do it is worth it 

Space Dandy just because it is still on and just really really random

Kotoura-san is a short series but really really good.

None of this is in a order they are all really good"
