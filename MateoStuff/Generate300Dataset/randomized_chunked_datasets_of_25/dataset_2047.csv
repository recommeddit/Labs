39500,best web browser,"There are substantial privacy and civil liberty issues with DuckDuckGo.  Tor Project accepted a $25k contribution from DDG, so you'll find that DDG problems are down-played.  Here they are spot-lighted:

* DDG promotes CloudFlare sites and gives them high rankings, which consequently compromises privacy, net neutrality, and anonymity:
   * Anonymity: CloudFlare DoS attacks Tor users, causing substantial damage to the Tor network.
   * Privacy: All CloudFlare sites are surreptitiously MitM'd by design.
   * Net neutrality: CloudFlare's attack on Tor users causes access inequality, the centerpiece to net neutrality.
   * (2019) DDG T-shirts are sold using [CloudFlare site](https://duckduckgo.merchmadeeasy.com/products/duckduckgo-t-shirta), thus surreptitiously sharing all order information (name, address, credit card, etc) with CloudFlare despite their statement at the bottom of the page saying ""DuckDuckGo is an Internet privacy company that empowers you to seamlessly take control of your personal information online, without any tradeoffs.""
* DDG is partnered with Yahoo (+Verizon and AOL by extension). These three corporations (same ownership) are evil in many ways:
   * Yahoo, Verizon, and AOL all supported CISPA (unwarranted surveillance bills)
   * Yahoo, Verizon, and AOL all use DNSBLs to block individuals from running their own mail servers, thus forcing an over-share of e-mail metadata with a relay.
   * Verizon and AOL both drug test their employees, thus intruding on their privacy outside of the workplace.
   * ~~Verizon is an ALEC member (a powerful superpac designed to put corporate political interests ahead of human beings).~~ (edit: Verizon dropped ALEC membership in 2018)
   * Verizon supports the TTP treaty.
   * Yahoo voluntarily ratted out a human rights journalist (Shi Tao) to the Chinese gov w/out warrant, leading to his incarceration.
   * Yahoo recently recovered ""deleted"" e-mail to convict a criminal. The deleted e-mail was not expected to be recoverable per the Yahoo Privacy Policy.
   * Verizon received $16.8 billion in Trump tax breaks, then immediately laid off thousands of workers.
   * (2014) Verizon fined $7.4 million for [violating customers’ privacy](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/03/verizon-privacy_n_5760132.html)
   * (2016) Verizon fined $1.35 million for [violating customers’ privacy](https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-racks-up-1-35-m-bill-for-violating-consumer-privacy/)
   * (2018) Verizon paid $200k to [fight privacy in CA](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/facebook-donated-200000-to-kill-a-privacy-law-but-now-its-backtracking/).  See also [this page](http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1401518&view=late1)
   * (2018) Verizon caught [taking voice prints](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/ac8p1x/verizon_voice_fingerprinting_on_customer_support/)?
   * [more dirt](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/62ezji/which_american_mobile_carrier_is_the_most_privacy/)
   * (2016) Yahoo [caught](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/04/yahoo-secret-email-program-nsa-fbi) surreptitiously monitoring Yahoo Mail messages for the NSA.
* DDG accused of [fingerprinting](https://betanews.com/2019/01/07/duckduckgo-fingerprinting-accusation/) users' browsers.
* (2006) DDG CEO's previous project was the [Names Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_Database) - a project for which the core purpose was to compromise privacy for profit.
* (2019) DDG hires CloudFlare to host spreadprivacy.com

69302,best major to study in college,"I studied business, but I'd do computer science or computer engineering in a heartbeat today - even though business was good for me, most of what I learned was from books. And I lost the opportunity to connect with smarter people before. I recommend CS to anyone: you can be artistic, make money, meet smart people, and not have to worry about the future."
16348,best sunglasses for fashion,Oakley TwoFaced prescription polarized sunglasses. My fourth year now. Lot cheaper without prescription.

Screw brinks... I'm protected by Hershey's.."
35293,best alcoholic drink,Bar across the street makes super strong bottom shelf screwdrivers for €1. Obviously I don’t go there unless I plan on not remembering that night and quite possibly waking up next to someone I don’t recognize.
4625,best text editor,Was using atom. Transitioned to vim recently as I needed a command line only editor for something anyway and ended up liking it. Oh and nano I guess for like config files and simple stuff.
35693,best alcoholic drink,"Mojitos!
