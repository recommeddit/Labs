31522,best hotel to live in,"Oh, no. Having stayed there, I definitely would not put the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego anywhere near the top of my list of nicest hotels. The area is beautiful, and you can tell there's a lot of history there, but it definitely shows it's age.

There are some things like the floors being wavy in the hallways, the stairs in some places being weird heights or the old cage elevator that have a bit of charm to them, but there's plenty of other things that were just old. Creaky doors, outdated fixtures in the bathrooms, average linens, etc. After the first night, we actually got moved from the main building to one of the other buildings over by the parking lot, which felt about as fancy as an airport Hyatt.

It wasn't an awful experience by any means, but it felt like you were paying extra for the name. I will admit, the property was amazing, but once you were inside, it was pretty meh. I don't want to sound like I'm shitting on it or anything, it was perfectly fine to stay at, but unless you're really into the history aspect, I doubt the hotel is something people on here would be impressed by.

That being said, we started our trip in Santa Barbra where we stayed at the Hotel Californian (https://www.hotelcalifornian.com/) and that is definitely near the top of my list. It was gorgeously decorated, the service was fantastic, and there was tons of bars and restaurants within walking distance."
22792,best celebrity,"Dwayne Johnson actually does seem like a genuinely intelligent and nice guy. I don't care what anybody thinks, [The Rundown / Welcome to The Jungle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327850/) is one of my favourite movies of all time. Perfect mix of action and comedy, in my opinion. And his performance in it was fantastic.

Shit, now I feel like re-watching that movie again."
25201,best spiderman actor,Tobey!
70112,best major to study in college,"Reddit is a fickle place. In one post, you'll read posts congratulating people who quit there jobs and travel, go to museums, watch films, and contemplate their current state in life. But then the next post will talk about how doing and studying such things is a waste. Nonetheless, I enjoy this website, I just think you gotta' do what you gotta' do. If you get off to electrical engineering or Shakespeare, go for it."
3007,best webcamera,"the issue is thickness. if you increase the sensor size your lens will also get bigger. The small sensors have the advantage that they basically focus from near to infinity. They are essentially pinhole cameras. That doesn't work with larger sensors.

Besides, with enough light you can easily drown out the noise of a small sensor. The issue is that people don't have a proper light setup. Fixing the missing light problem with better sensors/ lenses gets expensive and big real quick."
16691,best pet for toddlers,"I guess a rabbit? I don't know much about them as pets though, or their general demeanor. Would she be happy with a Hatchimal or Furby or something pet-like?"
28625,best breakfast foods,Crumpets are the bread products of gods!!
73566,best battery bank,"It depends on if I'm somewhere I'm familiar with or not. If not, I usually leave tracking on, 1 hour intervals, and shut it off when I'm in camp. With that, I expect 2 days of use, at least. Varying factors include number of texts, weather updates, and GPS usage for navigation."
45566,best gaming system,"Yes love that game. 2 and 3 just didn’t capture the original to me, but the first one is gold."
36749,best alcoholic drink,"Happy birthday. I, personally, like really cheap crappy whiskey. Idk why I just prefer it. 
Things that are also good: ziplock; a shot of yager that you drop into a glass half full of red bull and blueberry grenadine. island devil .5oz pineapple vodka, .5 oz tequila, 1 oz coconut rum, champagne, Blue Long Island ice tea, .5 vodka, .5 tequila, .5 rum, .5 gin, .5 blue curacao. And finaaaally, pink lady which is basically gin, lemon juice, cherry juice and grenadine. Some people put egg whites in them too. These are my favorite “celebration” or ladies night drinks. These aren’t all exact recipes just what I remember from making them. Happy birthday!"
53001,best hiphop album,Aquemini and Stankonia definitely would be on this list if I had remembered them.
4085,best online college,"Oh, cool. Thanks, I will."
5701,best programming language for web development,"HTML, CSS, JS, background language of choice (Php / Ruby / Python) sounds like a solid plan.

You can start looking for work after doing HTML/CSS thoroughly and improve your JS on the (front-end) job."
4836,best home improvement store,Lowes. Every HD near me restocks returned items without verifying all the parts are in the box. I've been screwed on everything from locks to ceiling fans to a god damn toilet.
65374,best phone service company,Main thing is -- do you have an issue with AT&T? If not I wouldn't swap. If so Verizon may be worth a try.
12508,best gifts for mom,"I got all of our home movies that were on VCR tapes transferred to dvd. She hadn’t owned a VCR in years, so we hadn’t been able to watch them in a long time. She cried, I cried."
12615,best gifts for mom,"Ugh, I hate that. I'M TRYING TO BE NICE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE TOWELS ALL MUST BE FOLDED WITH THE TAGS FACING THE INSIDE? And then she goes and re-folds all of them."

33069,best energy drink,THE THIRST MUTILATOR!
30721,best country to live in,"America.  I'm not trying to be all ""Murica!!!"", but it really is.  It's literally the center of modern civilization.  Other countries have better human rights, better laws, but when it comes down to it, everything gets compared to American standards, that's not without a reason."
50482,best rap album,Haha right?!
42649,best detective show,Death in Paradise and Longmire
64560,Best Nike running shoes,"Replacement. I usually just have one running shoe for cardio and replace them every couple of years. 

Adrenalines were suggested in the past and they felt good so I ended up just using them. Generally I don't need an up tempo shoe since I'm not really racing/running for best times, but I don't want something super bulky either. Feel like Adrenaline was a pretty good compromise that offered good stability and decent tempo but I dunno a ton about running shoes?"
15382,best tree for the garden,"I had a huge Japanese maple (still not that big), and a huge maple tree growing up.  The maple was great for climbing and the Japanese one turned bright red.   Incredible."
