"I'm pretty sure ""The Windup Girl"" was written in English.  And that ""The Three-Body Problem"" is terrible.  Otherwise, great list."
"Great question. As University of the People is pretty much free, I have no idea how that works. You shouldn't need to take any loans to get a degree there. But no idea if it would work to defer any existing loans."
Or just pack an unloaded magazine. I learned the hard way that is also considered a firearm.
"You can use a million. Lots of brand recommendations here. 

What info you really need is that you need one that does USB C PD - or Power Delivery. Stick to options with that and you will be fine. 

All pixels, newer iPhones, and some new Samsung's I think all use USB C PD. What's important there is that reg usb c on a power bank, will either charge a pixel slowly, or not at all and you'll think it's broken. It's not. It's just a different and newer/more specific standard. Pixels do not Support Qualcomm Quick Charge in any gen. So that's useless for you. 

I use Anker, EasyAcc, or Aukey. But any number of brands are ok. I'm a pixel 3 user and was a pixel 2 user. So I have lots of experience. I've also been using power banks for around 8 years. So I've experience in the space."

Yeah a love letter and my weed right underneath it (previously in the inner zipper pocket) . Good guy TSA agent
"I got my mom an iPad too! No more squinting at her phone to creep FB or Reddit (hi ma, youâ€™re cool as hell). Such a cool gift to give."
"Just curious -- why would you bother to take the time to post speculation on why another redditor couldn't drink orange juice?

Why wouldn't you just wait for the answer?"
bought a hair catcher for my bathtub drain for 5 bucks. May be the best thing I ever bought on Amazon.
"AMEN. Never going back, this is so easy and comfortable and cheap and eco-friendly and hygienic. I wish I had it growing up."
"Watched it on HBOMAX yesterday.  Kept thinking about it so rewatched it today.  Honestly looking forward to watching it again. I thought it flowed really well, and damn Iâ€™ve never seen Robert Pattinson in anything but he was amazing.  Keep thinking the other guy was a like a young Denzel, then felt dumb when I looked him up on IMDB."
