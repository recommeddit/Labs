69337,"Pre-med really isn't a major, though. Plenty of people with a BA or BS in psychology go on to medical school. Making sure you have the right pre-requisite courses is important. Any major can apply to medical school.

Your comments are highly insulting to psychiatrists and psychiatric care generally. Psychiatrists are physicians first, and they utilize their medical training in their daily practice.

I think you should withhold making such comments without the experience and knowledge to back them up.",best major to study in college

I bought it immediately and did as you did and did a factory reset on the 6s and had the carrier unlock it. Now I use it as a remote for just about everything in my house.
