You're a literal saint and I'm a dummy for not checking the internet!!
"There are more people pursing physics than there are jobs for physicists, so the field is very competitive, especially in particle physics. But if you go into it with an open mind, and pick up some other marketable skills (statistics, engineering, programming, technical writing) you can still be fairly competitive in other quantitative careers. There are a few more arrogant people who think that they will be the next Feynman than in other sciences, but that usually gets beaten out of them in grad school. Also, the LHC is only one of the awesome places to work at. Granted it is the hot one right now, but there is so much more to physics than just particle physics, and a lot of very great places scattered all over the world. I'm not telling to avoid particle physics, but keep in mind that there are other exciting subfields like AMO, condensed matter, biophysics, cosmology, and so on.

Overall, 9/10 would do again. 5/10 with rice."

"[Triwa.](https://www.triwa.com/us/sunglasses/mens-sunglasses/) They are expensive but frequently go on sale 50% off and currently have a 15% off promo code: SAGE15 that stacks. 

They make a few models that are reminiscent of ray ban wayfarers and club masters but once you hold a pair in your hands you'll know just how shit and flimsy all Luxotica sunglasses are. They are hand made, hardware is top notch stainless steel, and come with extra screws with loctite already applied that I have never had to use. Mine have survived many drops onto rock and asphalt, so far none of the screws have come loose.  

Their sunglasses are great, but their watches are way over priced. All in all, their products are extremely worth it when on sale."
