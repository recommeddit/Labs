68206,best science fiction novel,"My father had all the L Ron Hubbard novels, including this awesome looking hardback series with really actiony covers. My mother would never let me read them as a kid though, I never knew why, obviously learned about the controversy with Hubbard later.

Ender's Game

Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Neuromancer

Starship Troopers

Hyperion

Pandora's Star

I personally find Dune to be in the 'Star Wars' category of science fiction. Aka fantasy. So wont include it. The 'science' in Dune is more political/cultural than tech.

Foundation gets a nod, but its a bit dense for the average reader.

I feel like Sirens of Titan deserves an honorable mention just for being...different.

There are so many more great books, but I just went with the ones that are most memorable to me. Michael Crichton also never makes these lists but is one of the few authors I have read exhaustively."
