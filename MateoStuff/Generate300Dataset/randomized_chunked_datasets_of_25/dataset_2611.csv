7695,best laptop for general use,"Hey my laptop just broke and I'm in the market for a new one. I'm a physics student and I would like a laptop mostly for coding and lot of multitasking. I dont really need a graphic card but I want it to have short loading times and to be able to run multiple things at the same time  without losing performance. My budget is 700€ but I may extend to 1000€

Thank you guys"

35085,best NFL player,This is almost my exact list except I had Jerry Rice and Jim Brown instead of Madden and Unitas.  Madden didn’t have an NFL playing career so he doesn’t belong.  Couldn’t argue against Unitas though

55527,best action and adventure novel series,"I just started The Name of the Wind. I am not finding that Rothfuss is any special or spectacular at writing. I've only gotten to Chapter 6 and still unsure of whether or not I want to keep reading.

Do you have any advice or comments on this book to help me? My problems so far include the lack of description and characterization. First, I am not getting a clear picture of any setting the characters or in or what the characters look like. Second, whenever a man says anything in this book, it could be any of the people in the room talking until I read the name of the character who spoke it. There doesn't seem to be very much personality to any of them yet."

22370,best celebrity,"I met A few celebs working as an event photographer for fundraisers from time to time.

Chevy Chase, well, the stories are true. He was a huge jerk.

Jamie Lee Curtis was one of the sweetest people I've ever met, bar none and easily the nicest celeb I met working the camera. Very considerate and thoughtful person. She kept checking with us to see if she could do anything for us or if we needed any more shots she could help with. Great sense of humor too."

38410,best newspapers to read,"I think because reading a physical newspaper is supporting a dying industry. An industry that gained its strength during the foundation of a country and created a strong basis for our freedom. (edit: I should note here that I am from the States, and am only speaking about our own history of journalism.) A type of openness with which we were unfamiliar. 

Reddit has a lot of qualms about mass media, and I've seen some attacks on what newspapers stand for exactly in today's electronic world. While broadcast journalism certainly no longer represents what ""Journalism"" once was, I work at a local daily paper and can say we don't have time for that bullshit. We have a newsroom full of young journalists eager to report actual news as accurately as possible, working as hard as is needed to present the story to our readers. 

It's noble because everyone says, ""Why would I pay for something I can get online for free?"" But no one bothers to take into consideration that all those blogs - and even this site - link to the important stories that are often generated by print organizations. And with newspapers dying due to lack of support from a generation that thinks, ""If you can get it for free, why buy it,"" instead of, ""This is something I think I need to support more with more dedication so that it doesn't die, because what this industry does is important.""

Newspapers have been struggling with finding out how to adapt in today's market of electronic saturation, and they haven't yet found their sweet spot. Online advertising rates are too low but all the advertisers know they can get their product or message sen by much more accurate niche markets for a lot cheaper online these days, so it's a tough bargaining situation. 

Like all things, I think the bigger organizations will survive through the difficulties they face now and latch onto the next thing that will define how news is presented in copy form, but like anything where diversity is better, a monopoly will do no one any good and we'll just end up with more Fox vs. CNN vs. whothefuckever, completely biased sides with no voice of reason. Regardless of opinion or morality, newspaper ethics dictate the presentation of fact without sway. The good (and often locally focused) ones do this to the best of their ability. 

This is why I think reading newspapers is noble. Because I find a world without dedicated reporters scary. I think the passion of those interested in presenting this news is noble. And I think there is nobility in the readers who understand this plight and choose to support their news sources in the best way they can. 

Thanks for listening, and please forgive any grammatical errors, It's Sunday and I don't have a copy editor hanging around at my apartment."
