Yeah i might have underestimated the amount of hours i sunk into the game seeing as i played it so long ago. Still just an incredible game with some of the most incredible characters
"SA came in very early in the 90s, so that can't have been the reason. The only reason I can think of is SA and WI do not play as many tests/year as compared to England, India and Australia."
"Oliver Stone’s “Untold History of the United States”

"I know nothing but a different spin to what you asked is kinda what people budget for when buying gear.

I feel that in a fair few amount of countries 100 of local currency is considered significant so what you get for that price is the main limit. Sure enthusiasts will be willing to spend more. So whats the best option for the users style and location will vary.

Yes it is unrealistic that for less equivalent money to receive the same quality; that is psychology for you.

My usage case is pretty much a pocketable device that interfaces with a mobile device so a headset is desirable. Budget wise I want something I can kinda stomach losing. so life goes on and so does the search."
And that soldiers did meth for energy!
"And if you have time, the Marin and Sonoma coasts, north of San Francisco, are also amazing."
Didn't read. You are terrible and don't know what you are talking about. Goodness get lost.
Carowinds since it has about every coaster you could wish for.
"Ah thanks, I didn't know that. That would be quite useful if there was a pretty long stretch to get through."
"I'm in northern Virginia outside DC.  Native alternatives, sure."
Toms on sale for ~$50 or less. They typically make great quality sunglasses. Check Nordstrom Rack. They had a decent selection a couple of days ago when I checked.

"Suggestion: don't put

> NOTE: For this first post, I will not be mentioning DEs (Desktop Environments) such as MATE or GNOME. I'm aiming to keep this list as lean as possible, and I'm personally someone who dislikes OSes asking the end user to choose a DE to install. I would rather a specific DE be chosen and optimized for a given Distro (outside of bare installs like Arch). 

in a code block. It means I have to scroll horizontally."
I think this is the worst thing on the entire internet.
"I'm sure if you copy and paste the make and model into google there will be some at computer parts stores (idk if you have them in Italy, I know some EU countries do, we don't in the US ofc) near by or online. The amazon link was just to show.

"I had neighbors who handed out little pieces of paper with prayers on them.
