"Ah interesting, maybe that’s why I’ve had so many problems with google fi."

You can play Twilight Struggle “hundreds of times” and not be a pro player?  This seems unlikely..:
The fifth one knows he profits by not endorsing good teeth care products.
"Quick question, you say don't alternate scents across short periods of time.  Does that include across seasons?  Or would you recommend having a more 'summer' one for the spring/summer and a more 'fall' one for the fall/winter?  Thanks, sorry I'm very new to this!"
"Very nice summary. Typing from a 6S, I agree with everything you said.

Nonetheless, you got the “Hey Siri” thing wrong. The 6S was the first iPhone to be able to listen continuously for the “Hey Siri” command even while unplugged. Other iOS devices could use “Hey Siri” too, but only while using the charger.

I would also say that even if iOS 13 (and presumably iOS 14) is really fluid on the 5 year old 6S, you can feel it really isn’t optimized for it because of the heating and battery problems that it suffers since iOS 11. But still, it is astonishing how well it runs it."
No prob
I have a slightly different method (see below). I'm am interested in trying your method though. Looks like I know what I'm cooking this weekend.
"I'll get destroyed but, The Matrix. The advertising campaign leading up to that movie was unprecedented. Even today. The biggest mouth would not tell you what the matrix was. You had to see it for yourself."
I actually felt a pang of jealousy reading that. I need a friend that's an hp noob.
"I studied math, which was great because I really enjoyed it and it expanded my mind a ton. If I were in it purely to accelerate FI, I would skip college, keep the money, and go to a coding bootcamp. I could probably have saved $300k by now at age 24."
Prisoners
"Remenissions by Avenged Sevenfold
And
Electric Head (Part 1) by White Zombie 

Two of my all time favorites."
You should probably look at the mineral content analysis on the label then. You may be in for a shock...
Oh I don't doubt it's good lol. I just think the Baldoor worship is more amusing (and makes sense) in the context of its price.

"The Man From Earth isn't well known, but definitely a mind fuck."
">Suck my *cockle*

FTFY"
Think of the free workout you can get moving it every day to play!
"That’s a good comparison on levels of fame. I liked Meek A LOT more earlier on. Radio show freestyles after being up for 2-3 days straight. Fun to hear them. Dreams Worth More Than Money was the last CD of his I purchased. Kinda fell off after that.

Dave East still has plenty of time to make good and become more relevant. Sometimes fame is a curse though. I loved Kevin Gates, then he came out with his first commercial album and his sound went south (not geographically)."
Great to hear that I not only missed the great X2 but also another great ride because both were closed. Thanks for rubbing salt into it :-P
"Understood :)

So let’s say, I wanted to get the Bowers & Wilkins PX 7 with a aptX LL Bluetooth adapter + Modmic Wireless, it would beat all of these headsets?"
Alien by Thierry Mugler. Men especially seem to love it!
About Indy statement or Pirates one?
"I think Australia would be the best.
