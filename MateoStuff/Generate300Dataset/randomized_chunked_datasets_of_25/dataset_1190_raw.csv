"In Texas, we were taught that it was partially to ""save"" Texas. Texas just won its independence, but Mexico didn't accept it. The US comes to save the day while trying to annex Texas into the union (and then take some more land when it came to a peace treaty). In my college history classes, they were more blunt about it being an act of ""manifest destiny"" where the US saw everything West of its borders as inherently theirs and the Mexican-American War was a result of that. There was also a growing issue around slavery and southern states knew they could add Texas as a slave state, along with possibly more slave states with the additional land."
"Austin is about the least Texan city in Texas and I grew up a short drive from Portland and there's not much special about it and in no way feels ""European"". I wouldn't recommend bothering to stop in."
Thatâ€™s meanðŸ˜­....TY :) will look into it
"I bought one last week. Their 10000mAh usb-c version. Disappointingly, if I use a cable with usb-c on both ends, it's ph-1 charging the battery, not the logical direction. 

I need to use the supplied usb-A to micro-usc cable with the also supplied micro-usb-c adapter to charge the phone properly. While ph-1 reports ""charging"" or ""charging slowly"" on the lock screen, the overall charging speed is not too bad (about 2.5 hours for 10-90%). 

Wondering if direct usb-c charging were working, will be faster?

Who has a <10000mAh usb-c pd battery that works well?"
"De Jong is a solid striker, he's just best used as a work horse who produces great headers. Not really what we need in Oranje, but he's a great attacker. Weghorst and Dost are in the same category. Depay is great, so if Gakpo, Boadu, Stengs or perhaps Ihattaren can step up and have a breakout tournament, we're fine."
I love that we got all the way to the AFC championship despite having only two in the top 50 and 0 in the top 25. Shows how solid our team is from top to bottom.
"I have this monitor and although everyone says it's pretty good, I find the contrast to be pretty awful but I don't see a solution for this other than using an OLED TV"

"Kevin Hart

I worked retail in early 2011, and there was this guy who needed some clothes shipped to Atlanta, and I hooked him up with a surprise discount, and he was grateful. He then asked what I was doing that night, I said  nothing, and the guy introduced himself ""I'm Nate, I'm Kevin Hart's manager, he's performing tonight, here's my card, I'll get you in for free.""

So I go that night, thinking I'm just going to go watch the show, but Nate sees me, bring to the VIP Lounge where Kevin and 2 other opening comics are drinking Ciroc & Pineapple Juice, and Kevin was the chillest dude, really nice, talked about Philly, comedy, etc., and the show was basically his 'Let Me Explain' material. 

Mind you, this was early 2011, so it was right before he took off, but it was still cool. 

Nice dude though!"
Where did I say the hand-to-hand fights in Civil War were better? I just listed a reason why I like Civil War so much
I know Cornell does this. I wish my school did.
"Cold blooded, savagely calculated. Kudos."
That juggling from below scene was somehow fascinating.
Oh wow it really sounds like a bible then

It's almost impossible for me to narrow it down to one, because of the myriad of styles, techniques and different factors that play into all of them."
"Aside from the usual $MSFT, $AMD, $NVDA and ETFs.

$COST. Itâ€™s literally the definition of a dark horse in the retail world and wouldnâ€™t be surprised if it starts taking a very good portion of the retail world behind Walmart and Amazon."
"It's a pretty specific extension made for an online platform our company uses. Common users don't have access to that. The websites open in Firefox, but we need the extension to do our work."
Listerine stained my teeth. I think it was either the blue or purple one.
"I don't know how its taught today, but when I was in school (the 90's) it wasn't taught. The context of most US wars wasn't given. Instead they focused on how the war affected the US, and for the Mexican American War, it was the increase of territory from Mexico and the annexation of the Republic of Texas."
Thanks. Itâ€™s done âœ…
"You're mistaken.  The Numidians employed a legendary war machine, called a *hadn't*, which was operated by a team of highly-specialized mercenary engineers.

If the team of engineers operating the *hadn't* had switched sides, Hannibal would have won."
"It's marketed as a fancy luxury brand here. It's one of the earlier bottled water brands here from before people commonly drank bottled water in the US, so it kind of developed a stereotype of bring something upper class people drank. Bottled water was for country clubs and spas, not normal people. Plus it used to come in fancy glass bottles. 

Now it comes in normal plastic bottles but is still more expensive than domestic brands. At a gas station a regular bottle Evian might be $2, whereas you can get a bigger bottle of a domestic brand for $1. I'd say it still has some connotations of being an upper class beverage and someone might gently tease you if it was the only thing you drank or your preferred brand."

"Emily and Richard are the only clever parts of that show. Everyone else is just repetitive and growthless.

And I must say I'm surprised at your inclusion of The Wire. Not because it isn't a well scripted show, because it is, but because you have the Sopranos and Deadwood right next to it. Two shows that, in my opinion, far better showcase wit and writing ability."
