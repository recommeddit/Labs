13533,best research paper archive,"It's the usual issue - authors won't know they can do this until more readers contact them about it which they won't do because authors aren't responding. 

But there's another problem - journals actually have a purpose, which is to give credibility to papers. That's not true of the Hollywood Upstairs Journal of Medicine, but certainly of countless others. 

The idea of systematic peer review (not just ""my antivaxx buddy read this and said it sounded good) and reputation is important. On the other hand, clearly we have a problem of boring studies not being published and broken peer review. 

It's all a bit of a clusterfuck."
10551,best suitcase lock,"Heck, go pay $50-$60 for a ""stripped lower reciever"" for an AR-15, it's the part of the firearm that's legally the gun. But there's nothing to make it work.

62412,Best RPG game on PS4,"Completely solid train of thought, thank you for explaining. 

I agree, it definitely depends on the definition of ""RPG"" that you go with. For me, the exploration and multitude of sidequests, while still allowing for intensive character customization (I think the chip-setting allows for far greater customization than most RPGs, just not aesthetically), plus having a huge selection of weapon options, feels very RPG to me, which I why I initially questioned. You make completely fair points though."

34558,best NFL player,"Also, regarding the 57 games thing, he was already 33 when the NFL even started being a thing and there weren't that many games in a season back then, so he inherently won't have played too many games.
