13533,"It's the usual issue - authors won't know they can do this until more readers contact them about it which they won't do because authors aren't responding. 

But there's another problem - journals actually have a purpose, which is to give credibility to papers. That's not true of the Hollywood Upstairs Journal of Medicine, but certainly of countless others. 

The idea of systematic peer review (not just ""my antivaxx buddy read this and said it sounded good) and reputation is important. On the other hand, clearly we have a problem of boring studies not being published and broken peer review. 

It's all a bit of a clusterfuck.",best research paper archive

You make completely fair points though.",Best RPG game on PS4
