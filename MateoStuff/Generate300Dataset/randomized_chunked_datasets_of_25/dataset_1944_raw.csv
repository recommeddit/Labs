"I think I figured out how to do it in Excel thanks to your help, but it’s requiring a few steps that aren’t ideal for the speed at which we are moving through these files. I’m going to leave this thread open in case anyone happens to know of alternative software solutions. I really appreciate your insight! :)"

"Sure, and then you run the risk of somebody showing up and publishing malicious packages under a vastly popular name. So you've got to vet them thoroughly, and there's another big task with high stakes.

Also your scales are off. Happy pack is about 1/25th the downloads, and node/jquery/etc are all wayyyy larger. Not to mention, Node **was** forked after the community decided that the foundation wasn't keeping pace with standards and the community. Look up IO.js."
"Benfica has been to 7 European cup/CL finals and 3 UEFA cup/Europa league finals \(not to mention national cups where we lead comfortably in every list of conquests\). Benfica's European success starts in the 60's way before most clubs in that titles list, wether you like it or not it is one of the classic great teams of Europe and that's what this thread is all about: all\-time top European clubs."

The best webcam won't make you a better streamer. Just find a good auction for one of Logitech cams on eBay. I personally use a Logitech c290e 3 years ago and never needed another one.
"I'd say choosing a paint colour is easy.
But that's because my answer is to always paint white. Because it is the best colour for every room."
"He may have run the risk of running into another Cutter style situation (was that the actors name?). Angiers past experience was that he was never the man on the stage, never the prestige, and never experienced that applause first hand because he was hidden underneath. He wants to be the man on the stage in order to a) be the prestige and b) beat Borden at his own trick. 

Two Angiers running around could have potentially ruined their own lives. Borden and Fallon have a life long commitment to their art, which Angier (and therefore his exact duplicate) cannot and will not understand. They would fight and argue just as before as he and Cutter did. This is why he has a gun during his first experiment. 

The aspect I LOVE about this is what Angier says toward the end - not knowing if he's on stage or the man in the box. He doesn't know either, so in theory the ""original"" Angier could have been that first copy that was shot dead..."
