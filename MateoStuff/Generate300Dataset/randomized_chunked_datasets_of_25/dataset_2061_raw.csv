Yeah! I like that place too

I live in Belgium and I haven't heard of it on the other hand we do have lots of beers and it might be one that's made for international market only. 

I actually prefer delerium red ,the cherre chouffe rouge , kasteelbeer rouge, or chima red. nowadays as red beers go. 

  
For OP: just try everything and find out what you like (you might want to take your time and not do it all on one night). I also noticed my taste evolves as I grow older.   


I would recommend paring more . Like when you go out for dinner depending on the dish you chose beer, cocktail, wine, ... for example in the irish pub you take an cider with your food, in a mexican restaurant a margarita or something, .... It all depends on where and when you are drinking. I know a few restaurants where you can choose to get with each course a paired wine or beer.    


In doubt you can always ask your server for some suggestions or just take the plunge and try something new"
"Another vote for Spigen, been using them for more than 6 years and haven't had a single crack."
Agreed. In person classes en masse right now is insanity.

">antibiotics can eventually be needed. They won’t help bronchitis

Not totally true. Some bronchitis is bacterial and antibiotics can help. I have to take them yearly for bronchitis reoccurences"

"If you're about straight protection... I still think Otter Box is the gold standard.  My old 4 fell off a three story building and hit concrete, the Otter left not a scratch.

But if you like something with a bit more style, my 5 is in a [Grovemade](http://grovemade.com/collections/case) wooden case that I think is super slick.  Clearly not as solid as Otter, but it's a bit slimmer and I love the styling."
"Man I hate to say it, because I am a huge Stephenson fan and have loved everything he's written (even under his pseudonyms) but you are right about Seveneves. The last third was weirdly paced, over-descriptive, rushed, and poorly thought out. Maybe that part should have been published as a sequel. I would vote for Snow Crash, Anathem, Cryptonomicon, or Diamond Age over Seveneves."
"Came here to say the Uke.
It had a lovely sound, is cheap, and easy to start
A little hard to tune tough, I guess it’s related to the small size of the fretboard"

Just get the PG279Q. It's badass. Love it.
So I met Brock Lesnar in Milwaukee WI at I believe a smackdown show. I believe it was John Cena vs Brock Lesnar as the main event and Brock was put through the announcers table at the end. I came up with my sign that said MilBrockee and got to shake his hand I was pry like 10or11 at the time so his hand engulfed mine. Brock was a big heel at the time he patted me on the shoulder and thanked me for being a fan I was upset I didnt get an autograph I had the red and black markers still. 4-5 years later I was at a Vikings Bears Monday Night Football game. Brock was there again I was trying to get players autographs when Brock came up pointed to me and said “MilBrockee?” Absolutely made my already great night even better. And I got him to sign my vikings program this time. Blows my mind he could recognize me.
"Also make sure G-Sync is actually working, and that you've correctly set 144hz.

The difference between 60 and 144 is night and day. You can't miss it. It's impossible. More likely you have a bad cable, improper settings, or g-sync is not working.

"These albums are more recent but I consider them essential and  I  expect them to be celebrated for years and years to come:

good kid m.A.A.d city- Kendrick Lamar

To Pimp a Butterfly- Kendrick Lamar

Run The Jewels-Run The Jewels

Run The Jewels 2- Run The Jewels

Obviously these are not the only albums are consider to be the best albums of all time but Kendrick Lamar is the new king of west coast hip hop and he sure as hell deserves it and Run The Jewels is making incredible music and helping grow and expand experimental hip hop as it just begins to emerge.

Also, /r/hiphopheads has their essential album of the week posts if you are trying to get an ""official"" opinion on the matter."
"Fiordland Lodge in Te’Aneau, New Zealand.   I could write a wall of text about how awesome it was.  Look it up and go if you’re planning on a NZ trip. 

Also, The Sacher Hotel in Salzburg, Germany."
WWE theme songs really make you feel like a badass
Incorrect. Phish Food is the best.
Oh no. I am going there on vacation next month with my Verizon service.
"I personally feel Google Fi isn't worth it. When it launched it was unique in that it could simultaneously switch between the Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular networks for coverage. 

However, after the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, that coverage advantage disappeared. Fi essentially became another T-Mobile MVNO, and when you look at the T-Mobile MVNO landscape... Fi is expensive. 

$20 on Google Fi only gets you unlimited talk and text. No data. That same $20 can get you unlimited talk and text with 10GB of data from Mint Mobile or 12GB of data from US Mobile. Heck, even T-Mobile's own Connect plan offers 2.5GB for just $15.

Even Fi's unlimited plan feels overpriced. $70 for 22GB before capped speeds at 128Kbps. Mint offers 35GB for just $30, literally under half the price of Fi and with more data.

The Google Fi subreddit has also turned into a support forum with tales of customer woes. Sure, it very well could be a vocal minority that is populating the subreddit, and by all means I'm willing to bet a majority of Fi users are satisfied with the service, but seeing the consistent horror stories of poor customer service, not receiving devices, being without service, closed accounts, and more leads me to believe Fi's customer care isn't what it used to be.

The one feature Fi *does* have going for it is the superb international data roaming. I mean seriously, that feature is awesome. Seamless international data roaming at the same rates as domestic data use? Yes, please.

That said, eSIM international plans are becoming more and more popular, and more and more affordable. Traveling to Spain for Mobile World Congress? Grab a 10GB eSIM plan for 15 bucks from US Mobile, or a 1GB eSIM plan from Airalo for $4.50.

Fi can still be great for some people. However, I feel there are better options out there. You can get more data at cheaper prices from Mint Mobile, US Mobile, and other MVNOs, and I feel international eSIM add-ons are an excellent, affordable alternative for international data use.

So that's why Google Fi isn't in my personal recommended plans list."
"Some of them are built so the front doesn't fall off at all.  
Wasn't this built so the front wouldn't fall off?  
Well obviously not.  
How do you know?  
Well cus the *front* fell off."
"Hell yea Vainglory. The developers stopped updating and creating new heros, but the game is still running. They’re hoping to put everything in the hands of the community, while keeping the same gameplay experience. A great MOBA for IOS, and imo, the best one"
