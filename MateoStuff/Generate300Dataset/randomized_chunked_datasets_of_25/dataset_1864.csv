But that doesn't make it OK for randos on the Internet to just make shit up about it. Nor does it make it OK for the USPA to be all high and mighty when they're the ones who issued the ratings and they're the ones primarily responsible for the failure of oversight."

70431,best major to study in college,"Packaging science is exactly what it sounds like, a major dedicated to everything packaging. At my school, we learn everything from packaging machinery, design using solids works and audios cad, to material science. Jobs are likewise very diverse; I know people working in packaging supply chains, making the big bucks in medical packaging, and even people working on greener packages. Packaging is the biggest industry no one thinks about, everything comes in a package."
