It's been long known that the hand sanitizers increase compliance, which is why they're used in the majority of hospital settings. However, they don't get rid of spores and do a poor job against viruses, particularly uncoated viruses. Since these hand rubs also don't remove material, they're ineffective against those pathogens, and that is important. 

The traditional scrub combined with alcohol based hand rubs is used in a lot of places, but I've never heard of ethanol rubs alone as being an acceptable protocol for a pre-surgical scrub. 

Of course, most of this is probably moot as we agree that in the settings the vast majority of people will encounter, hand rubs work better. They also have the benefit that they don't promote drug resistance."
"If we're talking quality and features exclusively, then yes, MS Office is the champion. That does change however when we talk about other issues, like vendor lock-in, licensing, privacy, etc.

Here's my personal comparison between MS Office and LibreOffice. I use both.

First: Both LibreOffice and MS Office offer a **very comprehensive feature set**. But MS Office is a bit more comprehensive, especially when it comes to features for power users. In Excel you have more chart types available and more options to combine different chart types. You get PowerPivot and PowerQuery, which do not really exist in LibreOffice Calc.

LibreOffice generally lacks some of the ""modern"" features, like cloud integration, good touchscreen support (and inking with a pen) or live co-editing documents between multiple authors.

LibreOffice doesn't include a mail client / calendar but offers a decent vector graphics module, which MS Office lacks.

MS Office performs better in my experience. It seems to me, that LibreOffice is single threaded for the most part. It doesn't fully use, what modern multi-core processors have to offer. Consequently, I find LibreOffice a tad slower most of the time, especially when working with large documents.

LibreOffice GUI is old-fashioned. Not necessarily a bad thing. If you liked MS Office before they introduced the ""Ribbon"" you'll feel right at home ;-). The UI is also visibly buggy, especially on high (4K) screen resolutions.

Generally, MS Office seems more robust. I have LibreOffice crash on me from time to time. It's not extreme, but it happens more frequently than MS Office.

LibreOffice scores points when it comes to licensing, privacy and politics. First, it's free and opensource. Quite simply an unmatched value proposition. It's the only free and comprehensive office suite, that is available on all relevant desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Licensing, price and supported platforms can be relevant if you collaborate with peers, e.g. working on a study project and you don't want to force peers to use a proprietary/paid product.

It doesn't have telemetry and its non-existent cloud-integration can be seen as a privacy-feature. It uses a free format for it's documents, which reduces vendor lock-in, although in practice, the only softwares that really support that format well, are derivatives of LibreOffice. At least those derivatives can exist."

"Me too. I've been running it on my secondary PC for about 3 years and never had any problems (Aside from Nvidia driver issues a couple of times, now thankfully resolved) Mint doesn't seem to get much love for some reason (Edit: Actually, I imagine it's because a lot of competent folk see it as a beginners distro)"
"Philosophy major is not for finding a job. It's for those who wish to pursue college after a bachelors degree. You can go off to get a PhD and become a professor, or you can go to law school. Philsophy majors do really well in law school."

On some of NCL's ships they're coming out with The Haven. Check it out. It's awesome.
"I actually found ""Don't worry, you've failed"" to be quite inspiring. Like, don't worry about being like everyone else- you're you. You're special <3"

"Jurassic World.

The setting is a reboot of the masterpiece Jurassic Park, then all of a sudden it's complete shit."
"I will never forget the conversation I witnessed between my two 3rd grade schoolmates around the time the movie was in cinemas.

A: ""Dude, have you seen The Sixth Sense? You should really go to see it.""

B: ""No, I haven't. What is The Sixth Sense?""

A: ""It's the new movie with Bruce Willis where he plays a ghost.""

Luckily by the time that conversation happened I'd already seen the movie so all it did was cementing the impression that my schoolmate A was a really dumb A-hole."

"For pop and rock, contemporary guitar is great. But the design and the fact that the same note can appear four times can be immensely confusing.

Piano is very linear and straight forward. There is only one C4, unlike guitar. Piano also gives a better visual reference in your head.

If you're just starting and want something fun, stay away from anything requiring breath. You will have a steeper learning curve as you have to practice even getting a proper sound it of it. Hope this helps."
