30504,best Mexican war to study,"The catalyst for the war came over a border dispute. The U.S. put the Texas border at the Rio Grande, something it had been pushing since the Louisiana purchase. Mexico was going by maps based on Spanish colonial maps, putting the border at the Nueces River. President Polk orders the Army to set up at the Rio Grande (present day Brownsville, Texas) to protect the border. Mexico sees this as an invasion and sends the Army to intercept. Leading to the Battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. President Polk then goes to Congress and states that ""Mexico has spilled American blood on U.S. territory,"" and asked Congress to declare war."

4939,best home improvement store,"I don't have just one.  Walmart, Amazon, and Home Depot are where I end up getting most things.  I like to shop around and get the best deal between them.  Sometime I'll even do a mix of them for a project. Home Depots curbside pickup and Walmart's similar program are just so efficient lately as I don't want to be wandering around a store where over 50% of people aren't using masks.  I used to use Ace Hardware, but their pricing, selection, and staff just aren't what they used to be 10+ years ago.  I'm sure this varies from area to area though.  Ace also has a really poor online site that's totally unreliable and they've set me back a few times not having things a week after they were supposed to have them.  

I have an aunt who loves Wayfair and boasts about how she gets lots of free items (they send a replacement and she gets to keep the defective version), but she also spends large amounts of time arguing with customer service.  My takeaway is that Wayfair can be great if you are willing to deal with customer service, but if you dread it like me might be a site to avoid."

37508,best amusement park,"CP 2000's: Millennium Force, Wicked Twister, Top Thrill Dragster, Maverick. Basically 3 coasters that really pushed the envelope and changed the industry forever.

CP 2010's: Gatekeeper, Valravn, and Steel Vengeance. While Steel Vengeance is excellent and easily the best ride there, these 3 rides aren't nearly as revolutionary as MF, TTD, and Maverick. Not to mention that this decade saw many things implemented to the detriment to the park, in my opinion, such as a paid locker system and fast lane.

Other parks have done quite a bit more this decade over CP in my opinion. Dollywood and Silver Dollar City, for example, have both put in many unique and pioneering rides such as Outlaw Run, Lightning Rod, Time Traveler,  not to mention extensive expansions to both parks in the recent years. Cedar Point is a great park, but the name they built for themselves in the industry back in the 2000's is long gone and other parks have come to fill that void."

That is all."
71015,best movies with a cool twist,"I’ve found that a lot of South Korean cinema leaves me completely unaware of what direction things will go.  So, the works of Park Chan-Wook and Bong Joon Ho are  good place to start.

Especially Park Chan-Wook’s revenge trilogy, as well as Stoker and The Handmaiden.

Other South Korean fare like I Saw the Devil and The Man From Nowhere are engaging stories that repeatedly surprise the viewer without resorting to cheap twists."

4374,best text editor,"I got a U3818DW, its a great panel for software development, I also do some photo/video editing and crypto/stock trading on it. All of the screen real estate combined with the Dell Display manager makes it really easy to arrange all of my windows in specific configurations depending on what I'm doing.

Also, even though its not billed as a gaming panel, I can't really see any issues playing fast paced shooters like Hunt: Showdown or RTS games like Company of Heroes 2."
41961,movies like Inception,Interstellar and Arrival both owe so much to Contact. really awesome movie.
37010,best roller coaster at six flags,Dominator is the better floorless but it still doesn't do much for me.  And I am not negating the fact that KD has a great thing with i305 and Twisted Timbers but after that KD kind of goes meh.... I really like Grizzly but would rather ride Roar....  SFA has a more consistent line up of rides that are decent across the board.
