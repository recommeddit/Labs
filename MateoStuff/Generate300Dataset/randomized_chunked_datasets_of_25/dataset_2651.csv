73349,"Well whenever some one ask me what distro they want there are always two options no matter how noob or advanced the user is . They are pop os from system 76 if you want all the ubuntu support and (official) software or Manjaro if you want to run the latest packages probably will be supported for ever and easy to use ui for aur and arch wiki support. If you never heard about aur(arch user repository) or archwiki theb pop os would be a better choice. 

I personaly keep on switching between two just for fun and can daily drive either m if i want. 

PS :- aur is not the easiest thing to use as there are many similar packages and comparing the to find the right and orginal one is difficult plus many popular software are not available in standar repo style but are in aur and thus need to be build rather than install which might not be the faster or even smoothest method but overall more software is available for arch than any other distro in the world . (not official as manny packages in aur like Spotify will download original .deb package and build it for arch)",best Linux distro

We have a squeaky mouse with a rope and rod that she likes to play with and I was able to lure her up to the upper tiers by using that but she just won't climb it. We don't know what her problem is with it.

My kids have tents that she likes to be in. She also has a fleece box with holes that have balls with bells attached that she can swipe. She also has other balls (one resembles a mouse or hamster in a ball) that squeaks we have feather toys. I feel like she has a lot of toys but would rather be outside.",best pet for toddlers
