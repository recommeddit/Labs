23043,best celebrity,"I met Harrison Ford at Disneyland when I was 6 years old. I have only vague memories of that day, but according to my parents, he was standing behind us in line with his wife waiting to buy popcorn.
  
My dad hadn't notice him and was faced away with me resting on his shoulder. I guess we made eye contact and I reached out with my bag of M&Ms to offer him some.
  
According to my parents he said, ""thanks, kid. I'm good,"" at which point my mom and dad turned around, realized who it was and proceeded to lose their minds. When they calmed down they asked me, ""do you know who that is?"" and I didn't answer, so they said, ""that's Han Solo,"" and I guess I just stared at him with my mouth open for several seconds. He chuckled and shook my parents hands and went on with his day.
  
Later that year, we went to see Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and I spent the entire movie freaking out at the fact that I had met Indiana Jones. And once in a while, I'll be watching Star Wars or Temple of Doom, and he'll call someone ""kid,"" and I'll get a big smile on my face.
  
TL;DR: When I was a little kid, I offered Harrison Ford some M&M's and he spoke some words at me."

23224,best social networking site for CS,"I haven't seen it yet, but I see a lot of fear mongering about social media which I feel is unjustified. Social media like other forms of media before it, like print, radio, TV, etc. is a platform to share information. Before social media became mainstream, you could still share information on the internet through other forums (I used to hang out on IRC). People can still distribute misinformation by making their own website and others can find it through search engines. Just as with social media, there is tons of misinformation and manipulation on other platforms and types of media. You'll get it with whenever people are involved. Yet there aren't any calls to clean up misinformation on the radio, there aren't calls to ban TV networks for spreading lies. They aren't talking about banning websites with fake news from DNS or hold their hosting providers responsible for it. So why is social media being held to a higher standard?

What social media has achieved is to lower the barrier to entry, so instead of a few big moneyed interests anyone can have their voice heard. Instead of having to spend a ton of money on a TV ad, anyone can create a simple ad on these platforms and reach customers. Instead of having to hire someone to create a website for you use social media to advocate for your cause.

News websites feeds on bad news. They focus on the negative aspects of pretty much everything. If you hear enough negative things about something you'll feel it's bad. Go out and look for success stories. How social media has helped a small business grow, how social media has helped crowdfund people in need, how social media has given voice to causes that warrant attention. They're out there. People use social media because there is value in the service.

Could social media platforms do more to police themselves? Sure but think about the volume of data going through those platforms. Even if those systems catches 99.9% of bad actors, there will be still millions of pieces of bad information. Think about how you can respect people's privacy while ensuring their security. It's actually a conflicting requirement. 

So personally, I don't feel bad about my work. I also get to see much more positive feedback (through you know -all- the feedback instead of just the cherry-picked stuff the news shows you). It's not like the people here aren't aware of the problems, they are just very hard to solve and mistakes will be made. As with most programming jobs you'll find that people fuck shit up all the time and you can either go complain about it or work on fixing it."

8770,best toothpaste,"Not a dental professional, but after browsing the dentistry subreddit, I came across some discussions on abrasive toothpastes and the like, and you should take a look at [This Chart](https://preview.redd.it/5t02mtxz4r161.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f6906fe985cbb23c34f3d27e781fe565cda7fb0). Pretty much every dentist in the forum said to avoid anything that's more abrasive than midway through the green section. You'll also note that pastes in the red section are actually considered to be actively harmful to the teeth. Close Up with Baking Soda is halfway through the yellow section -- It's just far too abrasive."
48405,best color to paint with,"I think the floor would look better with a paint color that has cooler undertones. It seems like it's clashing with the current warm color. We wanted white for our main living space that wasn't too cold or off-colored and we LOVE the shade we chose--Benjamin Moore simply white. It has slightly green and brown undertones that you can't really see just looking at it, but it looks amazing with wood and plants."
