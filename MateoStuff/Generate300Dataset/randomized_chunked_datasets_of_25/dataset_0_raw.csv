Each year my mother gets me an empty photo album and the next year I give it to her full of pictures of her children and grandchildren.
Elecom smooth is what i landed on and its great. I hardly notice the distortion and the texture is perfect in my opinion. Its a bitch to install but i found an easy work around if you are interested ill share it.
"Verizon > T-Mobile > AT&T > (Sprint when it was around) for me. I've had a Verizon signal in the middle of nowhere. But T-Mobile was 100% nonexistent on the Oregon coast, I've never had a situation except then, when there is absolutely zero signal instead of just a bad one that's hard to get."

"Moscow Mule:

2 parts vodka


1 part lime juice

3 parts ginger beer or ginger ale (I choose vernors)

Serve in a copper mug if you can, but they are rare to come by as there are some state laws that prevent/limit the sale and purchase of copper mugs.

Edit: I should actually point out that this is the drink that made vodka popular in the USA. Back in the day, vodka had never been popular in the United States until Smirnoff began marketing a this drink to the businessman in the 1950s (think Don Draper). Although vodka really took off once more brands began making the liquor as well as the rise in martinis, it was the Moscow Mule that first put vodka on the map.

This would have been a great r/askreddit question

"For me it's about handling feel and performance, but refinement is key at any price point. Shaking, vibration, noise those are all unacceptable. BEVs provide the best of both worlds for me, none of the unpleasant noise, vibration, smells, but all of the power and sporty handling."
Creed all the way!
"They integrate with another product to do the banking pulling in. So it's an ongoing cost for them to pay for that service (it's also probably setup per user, so the more users they have using the auto-import feature the more it costs them. So part of that monthly fee goes to that. But it's also all hosted by them so they have ongoing server costs and all that fun stuff to deal with.

On the plus side, they control the platform now so they don't have to live within the rules of Dropbox. As an app developer who has worked on rather complicated Dropbox sync solutions I can't even begin to explain how awesome it is to own and control the entire stack for sync. It makes a huge difference to reliability and features. You spend less time trying to hack around problems and more time making better features. 

My only major complaint with the new YNAB service is they don't encrypt the data I store there with my own keys. I'd much rather that only I have access to my data stored there. Instead it's encrypted on disk by a shared key that per their privacy policy or security docs only certain people at YNAB have access to. But either way, I'd rather that the keys to the kingdom be held by me, and not someone else. I have no qualms with cloud syncing when it comes down to me controlling the encryption keys."

"What area are you in? I had sporradic issues when I lived in SF, which almost always wound up being that I was on Sprint, had to change to T-Mo with my switcher app. 

Now that I'm in upper east bay, if I'm not on T-Mo, I don't have shit for connection. Sprint is the literal worst network in the world around here. Also, I've been randomly connecting to some unknown network here, and Fi refuses to put a block on it. 

I'm kind of at my end with Fi. Once the Pixel 6 comes out, I'm going to be taking a hard reconsider."
