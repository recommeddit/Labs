"This is just sort of my opinion, it won't fly with most others. But to me I really like just camping in the middle of the California high desert. There are tons of places you can go to where there's nothing. If you're more outdoorsy you can backpack a few days into the Sierra Nevada's and be literally almost a hundred miles from civilization. Something about being around unadulterated nature. Mankind hasn't ruined it. No roads or campground tables. Just you, your tent and the mountains."
"If you declare you are carrying wine/liquor in your checked bags, and use the airlines shipping containers, it's very difficult for it to get stolen.  Again, nothing is impossible, but UPS and FedEx stuff has been stolen as well."
"I agree, mostly. Like I alluded to in my comment, the Sopranos is a better show of ""writing"" on a line to line basis. The Wire's overarching story format (what I would call...crafting....schematic? I guess) is fantastic.

But The Sopranos is about far more than Tony Soprano. It's about the death of an institution, the changing of a country, and an exploration of (a)morality."
Curious what it’ll look like in six months.
"Chemical Engineering undergrad here. I *love it* but it makes me miserable. The only promise in the field is that ""laboral world is easier than academic one."""
"Not over ear but I join the praise. This set is amazing for its price as long as you don't mind pinching some hair with the band on occasion.

It is a very good set. There is a version with an in line mic but I don't have that. It is essentially unchanged for decades.

I can also join previous recommendations on the sennheisers and Sony sets as well as the ath-m50 which is a bit over budget but you cab sometimes find good deals. Also on Amazon.

I splurged on v-moda m100 recently but 70 USD will get you a good pair.

At this price I also recommend looking at AKG cans as well as the German Teufel, but the latter isn't to my own taste. Others recommend it."
"As an Irish citizen, I'm pretty sure our right to a kettle is explicitly stated in our constitution."
All good points! Nothing wrong with getting other people's input.
Modern combat is not available anymore a long time ago or is it because I’m in Germany that would be weird cuz it’s on android still
Thanks I’ll look into this! I’m open to anything between 15-16in

"Dexter is kind of a detective series.  Not my favorite, but definitely worth a watch...atleast through season 4."
I get zinc lozenges right at the onset.  One every 2 hrs. and I kick the cold.

Embermill is so freakin good!
"Play dough is awesome for handprints and footprints once it drys you can keep it forever, you can even put it in a frame to dry!"
Totally understand!
"Duluth Pack backpacks are great.  I've had one for almost 9 years, and it hasn't needed repairs yet.  I forget what their repair policy is, but I think they cover major stuff for free."
There is more money in people with teeth than in people without. Dentures don't need much treatment. The demand side of the equation grows strongly with more people keeping more teeth until older age.
How can I not rinse? That’s gonna leave my mouth dry as hell when I go to sleep.
"I am not saying that RO filtered water by definition is bad, I know that at least Singapore does use it as tap water. I was responding to

"Stable distribution. It receives updates really fast and never encountered any issues with it. Pacman/pamac is great. Easy integration with the AUR is a big plus. I quickly left all Debian based distro's after I started to use Manjaro, a new world opened up. It's my main distro together with openSUSE for months now."
