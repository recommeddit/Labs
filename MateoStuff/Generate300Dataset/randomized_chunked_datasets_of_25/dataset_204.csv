2282,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"You can't beat Rosa's. Making pizzas there was my first job. It was already my favorite pizza and seeing how it's made just increased my love and appreciation more. The dough is made from scratch and rolled to order as fresh as can be, the cheese is shredded from the block so there's none of that plasticy additive that preshredded cheese has, and the sauce is made from scratch and let sit for a day for the flavors to blend. Toppings are almost all fresh cut as well. Really incredible shit."

4749,best home improvement store,"Both. Lowe's has more interior trim, and typically better plumbing accessories. HD has better tools (Milwaukee, their house brand husky, etc ) and better rough carpentry materials. They're both about the same distance from my house, so I go to both depending on my needs. 

Local farm store for fasteners. They put the big box bins to shame."

10323,best suitcase lock,Well of course it can still happen but the odds of them losing firearms is significantly lower then regular luggage. But if they lose your firearms you have something that you can use against the airlines and thats going to a local newspaper. Your clothes go missing? No big deal. Several guns go missing? Thats a big deal.

3547,best college for research,"Try to get in touch with a current or former student. You can ask alumni that you or your parents/friends know personally, or you can ask around on the college's individual subreddit. 

I've also seen on a few college websites the option to speak 1-on-1 with current students, as well as your regional admissions officer."

68156,best science fiction novel,"Just like others have said it is hard to just pick 5 but here we go.

1.	Dune- Frank Herbert. Obviously. It’s amazing!
2.	Hyperion- Dan Simmons. This book is like several stories wrapped into one. Set in an expansive well thought out and creative universe. You really need to read the whole cantos though.
3.	Starship Troopers- Robert A. Heinlein. Just forget the movie it was horrible (I actually like it for its own cheesy merits but it is not even close to the book) 
4.	Forever War- Joe Haldeman. Where Starship Troopers could almost be considered military recruitment propaganda, Forever War would be its opposite. Think Vietnam but in space. 
5.	Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep- Philip K. Dick. A book that left me with so many thoughts and questions but in a good and satisfying way not in a frustrating way.

Honorable mentions

6.	Neuromancer, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Count Zero- William Gibson. All three count as one because I feel like you should read them all. These books started a genre of their own and influenced a lot of books and movies.

7.	1984- George Orwell. Probably the best book on the list except I’m not sure it really fits the essence of the sci-fi genre.
8.	A Clockwork Orange- Anthony Burgess. Same reasons as 1984.
9.	Oryx and Crake- Margret Atwood. Kind of disturbed me but very thought provoking and well written.
10. Ringworld- Larry Niven. Great concept, huge universe.

Guilty pleasures

11. Electric Church- Jeff Somers. Gritty, futuristic, guns, action, good main character.

12. The Last Exodus- Paul Tassi. Heavy gaming influence so really fun read if you’re into that kind of thing.

15538,best tree for the garden,"I would say pistachios because those things seem to be worth their weight in gold.  

I know some people mentioned weed but with the legalization of weed, my guess is everyone and their mom is going to be growing it and the price is going to plummet.  Large companies are going to undercut small growers who don't have the equipment, land size or infrastructure to turn a lower profit margin.  Monsanto is probably working on some kind of absurdly high THC frankin-weed as we speak which will be available at Safeway for less than what an independent farmer can charge.

Some people are mentioning fruits or exotics like lychee but the reason we don't see things like that is because of difficulty with shipping.  Shipability is often the limiting factor with a certain crop.  Do you want to be paying for refrigerated trucks or air shipment for your crop (as well as a certain % of losses)?  Even if you personally aren't the one shipping it, *someone* will and you will be paying for it.  Pistachios are dry, shelf-stable and respond well to shipping.  Maybe a couple pistachios fall out of their shells and slip to the bottom of the bag, that's about it.

Regarding fruits, what some small growers do is stay ahead of the large companies by converting their crops quickly.  Say you were growing plums when they came out with the pluot.  You chop off the branches of the plums and graft pluots.  That way you have a head start over the large growing coops who are trying to grow pluot trees from very small (because the conversion of so many trees isn't economically feasible for them).  And if pluots pass out of fashion and it looks like the next hot thing is plum-icot-arines or whatever, you can convert to those fairly quickly to stay one step ahead of the larger growers.  You could even hedge your bets by having multiple apricot/plum/peach cultivars going at once.  Then your company becomes well-known for new, interesting cultivars and attracts a niche customer base.  So I guess what I would say is rather than decide which fruit, pick a rootstock and scion which is compatible with the highest number of fruits and cultivars."
