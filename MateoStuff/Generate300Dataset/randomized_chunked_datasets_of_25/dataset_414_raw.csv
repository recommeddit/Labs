"1.	Google Calendar is the baseline if my calendar because it works with my email. 
2.	iCal is the app I use to synchronise my various calendars (GCal, Outlook for school email, a few subscribed Google calendars that I toggle on and off as needed, Facebook events, etc) across my phone, iPad, and laptop. 
3.	Edo Agenda displays my list of daily events and functions as my day-to-day task planner."
"Sure, I'm generalizing but I think it's a pretty accepted thing that engineering starts high but tends to level out sooner."

Spoiled for me by a loud nerd narrating the film to his friend from one row back.
"Grammarly is a great resource that works automatically and teaches you along the way! (Also, I taught EFL in S. Korea! Feel free to DM if you're even in a bind!) Good luck!"
Sharp Objects did this quite well.
"Yes, there were moments in Red, White and Royal Blue when I just had to stop and admire the way she used words. I love romance but honestly, that rarely happens, even with my favorite writers. It happened multiple times in that book."
Yeah I'm actually using the 6th edn right now but need the 7th as it has the up to date case studies that i need for these damn assessments.

"The last part is key, ""if you give the webcam enough bandwidth"".

How do you propose this? Like the above poster said, USB 3 and 3.1 are not sufficient. I'm gonna assume this is true to a degree. Then we're looking at PCIe speed now. So for a laptop, manufacturer will need to run a PCIe riser cable from the motherboard to the lid of the camera. That's not going to be cheap. For desktops, your only solution would be a thunderbolt 3 webcam which will be a hard sell because very few motherboards have thunderbolt 3 port."

"It's about incremental gains. You farm one monster to build a set of armor that will enable you to get a kill on a more challenging monster and gain access to its armor set.

Then you mix and match armor and gems in order to put together a ""build"" that will allow you to tack the end game monsters."
Science Friday!!
"That’s basically what I had to do. The finale winds up being really satisfying. Then S2 is great, S3 was good, and S4 is where I really fell in love with the show."
One thing to consider is maybe a couple of different sized ones?  Honestly anything from Japan is great but I'm biased.
