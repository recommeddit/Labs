40238,"> > ""AMD still has ***a long way to go*** to compete head to head with Intel for the gaming crown""

TIL that ~10% in 1080p with a $1200 GPU in 2020 is ""a long way"".

Like having a car that can corner at 1.2G instead of 1.1G because you put on extra sticky track tires that suck for anything else

The only context where it matters is literally racing other people. 

Gaming is just driving. Now driving a fast car is better than driving a slow one, but it isn't racing. Racing other people is competitive benchmarking for its own sake. Only then does it matter *precisely* how fast your machine is relative to others without consideration for any other aspects.",best midrange CPU

5030,"I agree. I have become much more familiar with the layout of the store and where to find certain things than their staff. The breaking point for me at Lowe's was when I was looking for a threaded insert for something I was building. I showed the guy in the hardware dept a picture and explained what I was looking for. He told me ""I don't think anyone makes anything like that. I'm pretty sure you'll have to find a way to machine it"". I ended up just finding it myself and never went back.",best home improvement store

However, things have worked out nearly perfectly for me and I wouldn't change anything. I got a masters degree - will probably get a PhD eventually and can work in a whole host of industries that I'd enjoy if I wanted. 

But like I said, geology would have been more prudent financially and would have been pretty cool - but as a high schooler/undergrad who was afraid of math, I thought it was all calc and looking at boring rocks.",best major to study in college
