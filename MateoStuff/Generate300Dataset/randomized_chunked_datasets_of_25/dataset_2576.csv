26050,best politician,"Maryland governor Larry Hogan. If you aren’t from Maryland, you probably haven’t heard of him because he’s mostly focused on state issues. I’m a democrat, so I don’t always agree with Hogan, but he’s willing to reach across the aisle in good faith so the least I can do is reach back."
34229,best NFL player,This is the most PFF list I’ve ever seen
33381,best electric car,Chevy Bolt.
36441,best alcoholic drink,"Way too sweet for me and a shit load of calories if you're watching your calories at all.

Gin and soda water muddled with lime and a dash of bitters. Not riddled with sugar, tastes more refreshing/less syrupy and has zero calories from the soda."
51347,best iphone case,Why this one over the apple leather case?
40238,best midrange CPU,"> > ""AMD still has ***a long way to go*** to compete head to head with Intel for the gaming crown""

TIL that ~10% in 1080p with a $1200 GPU in 2020 is ""a long way"".

Like having a car that can corner at 1.2G instead of 1.1G because you put on extra sticky track tires that suck for anything else

The only context where it matters is literally racing other people. 

Gaming is just driving. Now driving a fast car is better than driving a slow one, but it isn't racing. Racing other people is competitive benchmarking for its own sake. Only then does it matter *precisely* how fast your machine is relative to others without consideration for any other aspects."
43169,best detective show,Is the killing on Netflix? I know it used to be but I couldn’t find it last time I checked.
13863,best research paper archive,"Roald Hoffman, How Chemistry And Physics Meet In The Solid State. He emphasizes the intuitive nature of chemistry and explains solid state physics through qualitative arguments ... Really nice."
30959,best country to live in,"Belize, it seems like the best central American country for a US citizen."
33704,best electric car,"Totally with you on the dealer markups. Have you looked at the Bolt or the Model 3? I love both of those as well, but the Bolt is a worse road-tripper for sure."
68611,best science fiction novel,"Finally! Someone mentioned Lem!
I can recommend The Futurological Congress by him. My favourite sci-fi book."
62257,Best RPG game on PS4,Yes! I love having a huge map or open world for that reason. I explore EVERYTHING to the point where I almost annoy myself.
50749,best rap album,Guess I need a bigger window.
71617,best movies with a cool twist,"Not to be confused with The Fog. Both have interesting endings, but one won't make you want to get the time you spent watching garbage on a screen back."
44099,best items under $100,Condoms if you aren't ready to be a parent.
73799,best matte screen protector for ipad,Yea! But even the glass protector needs cleaning every so often!
24749,best anime,I rewatched and still loved it
59333,best perfume,Yes! Everyone knew I’d been in the bathroom in high school because of this perfume. Lol
42365,movies like Inception,You mean The Depahted
48050,best color to paint with,"> ...From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry and vision science.

lol did you even read the article you linked? There's literally no reference in that page to the emotional effects of colors either."
5030,best home improvement store,"I agree. I have become much more familiar with the layout of the store and where to find certain things than their staff. The breaking point for me at Lowe's was when I was looking for a threaded insert for something I was building. I showed the guy in the hardware dept a picture and explained what I was looking for. He told me ""I don't think anyone makes anything like that. I'm pretty sure you'll have to find a way to machine it"". I ended up just finding it myself and never went back."
2338,best headphones,"Passive mode seems to be what a lot of headphone manufacturers fall flat on, my WF's passive mode is ""alright"" at best. 

If you wanted the *TRUE* passive experience just pick up a set of open back cans. ಡ ͜ ʖ ಡ"
69330,best major to study in college,"Well... thats tough. If I had to change or wanted to make more $$ right out of undergrad, I'd change from Environmental Science to Geology.

However, things have worked out nearly perfectly for me and I wouldn't change anything. I got a masters degree - will probably get a PhD eventually and can work in a whole host of industries that I'd enjoy if I wanted. 

But like I said, geology would have been more prudent financially and would have been pretty cool - but as a high schooler/undergrad who was afraid of math, I thought it was all calc and looking at boring rocks."
22391,best celebrity,There's no way Paul Rudd isn't nice. He has the same anti-aging gene Keanu Reaves has. It must also cause niceness.
58233,best cologne,"I have tobacco vanille, oud wood and tobacco oud. All marvelous. But my favorite is grey vetiver."
