As someone with a mini version of your description sitting under a metal halide fixture in an apartment in a hostile climate....NNNNGGGGGH.
"And since you said iconic...  I will add Refrigerator Perry...  He was freaking huge (pun intended) in the 80s, even had his own GI Joe as I recall."
didn't think of using it that way... that is not a bad idea at all!
The Ninth Configuration (1980) deserves a mention.

"The added contrast and ""true"" black is something I don't really want to live without.  Especially with dark mode.  It's much more significant than a trivial upgrade IMO."
"Social Dilemma.

The Last Dance was powerful for me as a basketball and sports fan."
Most Washingtonians live closer to wild waves...but it's wild waves.
"Frankenstein is definitely science fiction, one of the earliest if not the first science fiction novel so it doesn't fit quite cleanly in our modern standards of sci-fi, as it sits on the birthing point of a genre."
"Tmobile didn't get my business simply because there is a startling amount of reports of port out scams. It happens across all carriers but seems to happen (or at least be reported) disproportionately often on Tmobile.

Also, my coworker has Tmobile and most of the time he cant even receive calls inside our office. Unacceptable. In my area, Verizon is king for coverage and building penetration."
"I'd also throw in the North Shore, it's beautiful"
"They do label it as a list of the ""top 100 sci-fi books"". Not ""a list of 100 sci-fi books"". So it is very fair to attack the list for not being the ""top"" of sci-fi literature."
Thatâ€™s exactly why you should just use threads like this to your advantage.
"Verizon is the best in CO. I hear AT&T rules east of the Mississippi, Version in the West."
My theatre used to use those as our monitors. Solid audio quality
"Bluebell Cookie Two Step.

It's a mix of cookies & cream and cookie dough... it's the best. However, it's almost ALWAYS sold out at my grocery stores :("
"ultraedit, but notepad++ is free"
Expensive booze.
"Hey now, the IE largely voted blue this past election.  Only two of the IE's congressional districts are still red, and one of them includes a bunch of eastern land not actually in the IE."
"> Why I didn't find it when I was looking for a good file manager?

It's much younger than `ranger`. Give it a try!"
"The Last Dance. I'm a big basketball and sports fan though so that played a role haha. It's coming to Netflix in the US on Sunday!

"[This Acer monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009484&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-Monitors+-+LCD+Flat+Panel-_-N82E16824009484&gclid=CO7umvWM7s0CFdNahgodF_EFtQ&gclsrc=aw.ds) is the one I use and it's incredible. Amazing colors (IPS panel) and a small bezel. It has great viewing angles too. Only problem is that it's glossy, so if you're near any lights it could be annoying. It's 1080p and has a refresh rate of 60Hz."
Outlander! It also has a pretty good (and accurate) show on Starz.
"Baked oatmeal cut to six pieces. Each morning put one from fridge to toaster oven, then bring it office."
