"No officer, I bought this meth to trade with other survivors in the event doomsday scenario."
General use (mainly dealing with large databases with programming and excel).
"Vodka diet coke, or i'll go with Sailor Jerry's and diet coke. They both will kill your workout if you drink too much as what gets you is the hangover not the calories."
DAMN. That's who I was missing from SAF. Thanks. He definitely makes it. I'll replace Sutcliffe with him.
