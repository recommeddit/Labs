3672,"The problem with doing only a top 100 listing is that it would be even more affected by the exact methodology used to generate the list. 

And the methodology for university listings is always more than questionable. For instance most listings based on university reputation say more about the university's position in previous rankings (favoring mostly us and UK universities) or about how impressive a university's name is (favoring ""University of [country name]"" and ""University of [capital city]"") than about the actual quality of the university. 

But including the top 1000 you can at least reduce this to the point where you can say that the list includes a reasonable fraction of all top universities in the world, without having to go into too much detail about whether ""university of A"" is better than ""B university"".",best college for research
