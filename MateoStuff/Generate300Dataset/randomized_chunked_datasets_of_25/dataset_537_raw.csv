"I own one pair of sunglasses, Ray-Ban Clubmasters. They truly go with everything in my wardrobe, but particularly when I'm wearing my more edgy pieces.

I'd like to own a pair of subtle cat eye sunglasses as well. I'm thinking of ordering [these](https://www.aceandtate.co.uk/katie-bio-black-s) (or something very similar) the next time I'm going on a sunny holiday."
"Hmm I have no idea I don’t own a Mac...best thing is post this as question , someone will answer you ."
"Came here to say this! I love her content because she is so thoughtful and respectful while still being funny and lighthearted, and because I can always find something that someone else will like to introduce them to it. My grandpa and I have bonded over her nautical videos."
"Thank you so much! I’ll keep this into consideration. Suuuper hyped to get my own artisan pad. Amazing review, u are awesome!"
This is the correct answer. Nothing compares to Maui Jim clarity
"I ended up going with `needle` but I'm not thrilled with it. The API is too awkward with it simultaneously supporting callbacks, promises and streams.

My concerns with `node-libcurl` were primarily related to `node-gyp`. But I never really gave it a genuine shot, so I'll do that and see if I have any good feedback for you."
So Scandinavia is more gender equal..
Dude literally nothing on that album sounds like death grips other than maybe the first song
"Balotelli is a fucking tit, and he's shite, 1 league goal this season."
"Anything 69,ik he’s a piece of shit but that fucking yelling gets you the the mood"
"Who is the GOAT, then?"
"As long as Amon Amarth is playing, you can literally achieve anything."
I'll give you the opinion of a long-time web developer: most developers use chrome to create and test sites.
"None of those fit... Miami is especially not outdoorsy. There is a beach and that's pretty much it. There's nowhere to hike. The Everglades is a river of floating grass populated by alligators under a cloud of mosquitos.

Also, being outdoors here outside of December through February is generally an unpleasant experience."
Thank you (: when will you make a best gaming laptop list for august?
"Right, which is why I compared it to the book's writing and said the show is propped up by other things."
"I heard it was every three months. I struggle with bad breath even though I take care of my teeth quite regularly and floss. Even my dentist has noticed improvement. 

I think it has something to do with my tonsils though and I may have to have them removed."
IMO Fiji but its expensive so otherwise just Dasani
"Well, Manjaro is my retro-gaming distro of choice. It's the only distro where I could install Need for Speed 2, a game from 1997. 

Linux is the same everywhere, more or less (the same kernel and applications), the difference is the community behind every distro, and the Manjaro folks are the best. It's a real pleasure to have something broken and work it out on the forum with them."
"I agree they recommend the 3950X for a “hobbyist” as a decent machine before threadripper.
I am a hobbyst, compiling stuff on a daily basis on an ageing i7700k without much issue. 
The 3950x is a beast of a CPU that is hard to justify in most cases honestly. 
I could use more cores to let a dev VM run more snappily but goddamn is Steve out of touch on this one."
"TSP is a degreaser that you wash your walls with before you paint so the paint will stick evenly. Go to the paint stores and take home all the chips they have, tape them up on your walls and leave them there for a couple days, you’ll see what sticks out to you. Anytime you walk past and don’t like one, take it down, soon you’ll be left with just a few. Get testers of those and see which one you like. Be sure to put them on different walls and look at them in different lights (morning, afternoon, night, lights on, lights off, etc.) as they will look different throughout the day. Even whites have an undertone that will get pulled out in certain lights.

Look to Pinterest for inspiration and don’t be afraid of colour, it’s just paint and can be repainted if you end up not loving it! Good luck!"
"As much as I understand your desire to spread information. I have a hard time listening to dental-hygiene recommendations from someone whose mouth was in such poor shape.

I have some hands on experince in the dental world (as well as a familial connection to a renowned practice in the NYC area), and some of what you said is either A)common sense or B) partially correct.

There is a paste called GC MI Paste Plus... it contains a milk derived complex of casein phosphopeptides (CPP) and amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). As well as flouride. 

The MI Paste aids in maintaining the pH in your mouth, in the re-mineralizaton of the teeth and presents a reservoir of ionic calcium and phosphate at the tooth surface, among other things."
To be fair most of his life he's been hounded by mobs of people. It would make anyone salty after a few decades.

"Off season was really good. I know it’s popular and not interesting but I really enjoyed it.

Edit: just finished listening to I TAPE and it was also good"
