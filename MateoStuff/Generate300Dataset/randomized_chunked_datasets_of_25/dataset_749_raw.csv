Ummm as a person from Tennessee who has spent many a Halloween collecting loads and loads of candy I can confidently say that while we may be googling Red Hots (which I honestly have zero explanation for) we are not placing them in our Candy Bowls...who the fuck wants RedHots as Halloween Candy?
"Mojitos are great - especially when it’s hot out. The proportions of everything can adjusted based on personal taste - but here’s mine:

2oz white rum
.75-1oz simple syrup
Juice of half a lime
2-3 large mint leaves (try different kinds!)

Combine in a tall glass and use a muddler to chew up the mint. If you don’t have one, just toss a few ice cubes in a shaker and shake the hell out of it.

Top with club soda and lots of ice. 

I’ve recently tried the unsweetened ‘natural’ soda water (lime flavored) with decent results when I didn’t have fresh limes, or was too lazy to squeeze them. Fresh mint leaves are a must, however. I’ve also made simple syrup with baking Splenda - it tastes great, but just doesn’t add the same body that regular sugar does."

There are tons of RPGs that more or less ignore story and just focus on a good dungeon crawl. The souls games fit into that category.
"*Mad Max* and *The Road Warrior* (A.K.A. *Mad Max II*)

Sky Riders (1976 made for TV movie)

*Aliens*

*Aguirre, the Wrath of God*"
"Katy didnt kill the soul sucker, she just wounded it. Shang-Chi definitely killed it

Also i liked Wenwus death personally, thought it was so amazing how much Tony Leung is able to say without words and just his expressions."
"Hyperion is the best sci fi novel I have ever read!

There are a few I think should be on that list like Rendevous with Rama.

Tons of books should be on there. 

FOUNDATION series."
Afghani's have Rambo.
"Same here. I’m about ready to upgrade some of my external battery packs to USB-C, so maybe I’ll grab some good cables while I’m at it."
PA- Hershey! I’m going tomorrow!
"I've always wanted to have a bakery or be a world class cook. I loving cooking and baking so much, and I make amazing food for a 16 year old. However, I'vee read a lot that culinary school is not worth the time and money unless you are truly inexperienced. Most people say just get a job working at a restaurant and work your way up, experience is worth more in the culinary world I guess."
A related question if anyone has ever played Midtown Madness.. do any of these newer games have a cops and robbers mode? It's basically capture the flag with cars. It was an excellent way to kill time and I've been trying to find a new game that offers that play-mode for years.
"As a New Yorker, that was the impression I got of Chicago.

"All instruments are hard to master, but I've found the steel tongue drum (like a rav vast) is very easy to get the basics."
"But if you do that 100000 times, they may develop more acrobatic abilities and longer limbs. Things that help them catch onto ledges."
Fucking YES all night long
"While I agree with you with respect to carbon adsorption, I feel it is relevant to note that with minor changes in water chemistry and constituents (pH, silica, zirconium), the adsorption preferences of granulated activated carbon change significantly. For things like arsenic, which are non-acute contaminants (generally speaking in drinking water), it would be unlikely based on ion-selectivity of the carbon that you would have any effective removal. [Adedge](http://www.adedgetechnologies.com/technology/overview.htm) has a great amount of research concerning arsenic and uranium removal. Their media is a granular ferric hydroxide and the page describes common interactions with ions which decrease efficacy of adsorbtive media. If you really want in depth and highly technical answers, see [this](http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P1009FDL.PDF) EPA study.

Now, if you are dealing with acute inorganic and non-biotic contaminants such as nitrate (infants are especially vulnerable), there will be little to no removal given the nature of the molecule. If you are on a private well and are on septic, have your well tested for nitrate and coliform bacteria annually or more frequently. FYI 40 CFR 141.23, 24 and 26 is the safe drinking water act maximum contaminant levels of inorganic, organic, and radionuclide contaminants. 10mg/L is the nitrate MCL and water above this level is considered a very high risk to public health and generally considered non-potable (in the US). 

Where the OP may have some success with a brita filter would be with turbidity and total dissolved solids. As nopropulsion noted, cryptosporidium, giradia and other microscopic nasties are harbored by turbidity and TDS. While it would be unlikely that you would have total removal, it would be synergistic to filter and then try for microbial inactivation with chlorine. Essentially, you are removing protective environments for the microbes and allowing for more contact time for chlorine with microbes rather than organic matter. This would be assuming you are starting with non potable water.

Ultimately, activated carbon is typically geared for aesthetic improvement. Removing halogenated organic compounds and chloramines, which are compounds that form in chlorinated water, is the typical mission of a brita filter. Taste and odor improvement yes, health issues, probably not.

Additionally, for chlorine odor issues, call your water provider and ask them if they are currently meeting proper [chlorination breakpoint](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=breakpoint+chlorination&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1680&bih=935&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=umZr92Ir4Z1TJM:&imgrefurl=http://www.cee.vt.edu/ewr/environmental/teach/wtprimer/chlorine/chlorine.html&docid=eK-wv8AqT-BG2M&imgurl=http://www.cee.vt.edu/ewr/environmental/teach/wtprimer/chlorine/zones.gif&w=947&h=690&ei=YcHmTsfcBbKGiQLXhNj9Bg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=873&vpy=159&dur=304&hovh=133&hovw=183&tx=177&ty=79&sig=102303205236723783424&page=1&tbnh=131&tbnw=180&start=0&ndsp=41&ved=1t:429,r:4,s:0). Often times, if there is a strong chlorine odor, the water treatment operators have actually not added enough chlorine."

Our house was painted Benjamin Moore Balboa Mist when we moved in and we really like it (we have medium dark floors). It's very neutral greige color that isn't too grey and seems to go with everything.
"> We're all aware that they are not really safe, but they don't have to.

I was under the impression they're reasonably secure against random burglars, and hotel staff would need to swipe ID to enter so if they open the safe to steal they'll quickly be caught, fired, and prosecuted."
"**Australia** - biggest talent pool of cricketers, dominant between mid 90s to mid 00s

**England** - team drama and underperforming in the shorter formats

**India** - producing talented orthodox batsmen

**New Zealand** - losing in semi-finals

**Pakistan** - good bowlers and batting collapses

**Sri Lanka** - performing well at World Cups, reached finals in recent T20 & ODI WC

**South Africa** - excellent touring team and choking at World Cups

**West Indies** - dominant between the 80s to early 90s"

I’m getting this one too. That case has been my go-to case for my last three iPhones and I love it.
