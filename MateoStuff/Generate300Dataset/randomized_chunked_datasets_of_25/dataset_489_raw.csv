Have this monitor. I love it. Super easy to adjust any way you need and works very well if you plan on adding more monitors down the road.

Nobody I know is close by but my company pays for flights back home every once in a while.  Holidays I either spend at home or traveling overseas.

"Either of the calculators linked by u/ PeanutTheFerret should work fine, but _don't_ get the TI-84 CE you linked. The colors look nice, but it uses the same Z80 chip as the original ti-84, and the color calculations bog it down a lot.

(Edit: I'm wrong about this, see the thread below. The CE should be fine)

If you're looking for something inexpensive, go with a regular ti-84. If you want something fancier, the nspire series is nice, if a bit overkill of a calculus class."
"Thanks, had stands ad blocker which was great but then no matter what settings I changed I still got ads. And so thanks for this golden find, haven’t seen any ads since I started using uBlock Origin"
"Sadly, we don't know yet. They may announce it sometime this year, but I'm sure what availability is going to look like."
"This is how I discovered I was lactose intolerant.

Always avoided milk because it made me feel funny. Drank about a million one night in college. The next day was spent sitting on the toilet (which I guess is better than with my head in it)."

"The degree won't do shit.. It's your ability to set yourself up in the right place, put in the work and seek the opportunities that will help you earn ""lots of money"".

Everyone here keeps saying CompSci like it's a gravy train to high salaries. The fact of the matter is, a large number of people who do CS are not qualified in any way to become software engineers - they do the degree because they think it'll set them up without putting in the work to build their resumes or get internships or do side projects. 

Aim to get into the best university you can, choose any traditional subject, think about which career path you want to go down and then execute what needs to be done to be successful in both entering that career path and progressing."

"I got a VG248QE. And that was becouse it was the only one available locally, and any other choice was overpriced/way over target, so there's also that /shrug"
">That being said I probably save 75% of my pay.

As I struggle to figure out a way to pay a $1,500 retainer this week I just wanted to say I hate you.

(I really don't. I'm just incredibly envious.)"
I love the big happy fella that does all the fermentations.
"I 100% agree with this. I have gotten complimented multiple times. 

The downside - it's really pricey. The workaround I have is that I use Aventus on special occasions. My everyday started as an Aventus knockoff but honestly stands on its own. I've gotten complimented on IT as well.

Similar to Aventus - INSANELY cheaper. It's my daily driver and i still get ""what are you wearing it smells great."""
"I live in California, but have visited a lot of the US.  I don't know how much time you have, or what your budget is.

West Coast: Seattle, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite, Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Disney Land (Anaheim, CA), San Diego.  That's mostly North-South, with no other ordering there.  You could pick your interests.  Big cities?  Seattle, and SF for sure.  Beach? San Diego.  Mountains?  Yosemite if you don't mind crowds, Tahoe if you want a little more quiet.  Vegas and Grand Canyon just to say you been there.

Central: Yellowstone, Austin, TX, New Orleans

East Coast: Boston, NYC, Washington DC, Kennedy Space Center (Florida), Miami."
"One of my female co-workers said ""so not to sound weird or anything, but you smell really good."" I was wearing Fiji deodorant, not even the cologne. Haha."

"For me it's a brand thing. HD has Freud, Leviton, Simpson Strong-Tie...just to name a few. These are brands I depend on as a remodeler."
"I don't think this is necessarily true. I'm in computer science and my brother is in engineering, he gets more homework than me."
