34067,"Alright, let's start with the games I haven't played and my estimations of where they'd likely rank if I had. For context, I got into the Pokemon craze near the end of Gen 4 and beginning of Gen 5 and while Explorers of Time was my first ever Pokemon game, Black and White was my first main series game, so bear in mind I have a biased opinion:

I haven't played Yellow and it would basically be the same as Red and Blue with slightly more colour anyway, so only slightly higher.

I skipped LGPE, the idea of only Gen 1 Pokemon doesn't appeal to me, this would probably be near the bottom

I haven't played Crystal, it would probably be only slightly higher than Gold and Silver if I had.

I haven't played Diamond & Pearl, but it would likely be in the bottom half due to being incredibly dated

1. Platinum - When I was a kid, I asked my Dad if he could bring me a copy of Pokemon Diamond, (I was little and really liked it's role in PMD) and was surprised, but not upset when he brought home a pre-owned copy of Pokemon Platinum. Little did I know, that this game was to become my favourite game in the series. I've replayed it 3 times now with all starters, one of which was a Nuzlocke, so maybe repeated experiences are playing a part in it, but I loved how difficult this game was and I felt really proud when I earned victories against the Gym Leaders. The Sinnoh Battle Frontier is also excellent and I loved that Gen 4 gave new evolutions to Pokemon who desperately needed them. If Game Freak decide to make Gen 4 remakes, I only hope that I have is for them to be based on Platinum. I also loved the explorations of mazes in Mt Coronet and Stark Tower. Overall, not much else I can say.
2. Black 2 & White 2 - The content in these games were phenomenal, I remember gleefully spending hours in the PWT, Pokestar Studios and catching Legendary Pokemon just doing my own thing. There was a perfect balance between story and adventure and while yes, the story wasn't quite as good as it's prequels, it was still amazing. The only problem I had with these games was the implementation of the Key System. Seriously, why did you have to beat the game before you could unlock a higher difficulty? It didn't make sense. Other than that, they were amazing.
3. Black & White - I believe I echo the sentiments of many when I say that this game was the best in the series in terms of story, Team Plasma were great villains and they had the best characters in the series in terms of moral ideologies. Admittedly, the difficulty didn't really register to me since I used an overleveled Victini at the time (Hey, cut me a break I was a 9 Year old kid at the time) and when I replayed, I simply used my smarts and strategy to overwhelm enemies, but this was still a difficult game and I still miss the rivalry I had with my friends over whether Serperior or Samurott was better (Trust me, there were massive fights in the playground.) While I do have some minor gripes with the game (The postgame is lacking in comparison to other titles.) The story and creative Pokemon designs more than make up for it.
4. HeartGold & SoulSilver - These games are great, they added following Pokemon which should be in more games, have a wide and all encompassing postgame and lovingly updated the Gen 2 games to their Gen 4 model, but as you'll see, I'm not a fan of Gen 2 to begin with and it frustrates me to see that these games retain many of their flaws; the story isn't great, Johto is infested with Kanto Pokemon, the level curve is atrocious (Which really annoyed me from a Nuzlocking perspective) and it seems like no one would remember these games if not for travelling to Kanto. They're still excellent games to me and I enjoyed playing through them, but in my opinion, they're a tad overrated by the fans.
5. FireRed & LeafGreen - I felt a legitimate connection to my Pokemon in these games (Mainly because it was my first Nuzlocke, but moving on) and the story was well done in it's simplicity. I also enjoyed the addition of the Sevii Islands, but admittedly, this game probably wouldn't be as high if it hadn't been the site of my first Nuzlocke. Still, for what it's worth, if you want a Kanto playthrough, I'd suggest no better than these games.
6. Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon - I just find these games fun, maybe it's because I've played them too much, but I just had a good time with my team in this region. I will admit that most of the negative points of Sun & Moon still stand, namely the long cutscenes and handholding making the game unreplayable, but I played through with one of my favourite teams in any of my games so that might be a reason that I liked it regardless. Also, Team Rainbow Rocket and Ultra Necrozma were awesome. I also enjoy the Battle Tree and Ultra Wormholes.
7. Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire - I really liked Hoenn as a region from the few times I played it before and I remember jumping for joy when remakes were finally announced. I really liked the story additions they made for Wally, Rayquaza and Zinnia as well as the new designs for Archie and Maxie. It was also the first time I played through a game with my now favourite starter Sceptile, so that's probably another reason why I look back on it so fondly.
8. Emerald: I feel like this game would be higher on the list if I played it more (Hey, maybe I should do a Nuzlocke of this). The introduction of the Battle Frontier and Steven as a miniboss sound like great post-game content, but given how I haven't experienced those things and only played through this game as a solo-Sceptile run, I don't feel comfortable ranking it any higher. Other than that, Rayquaza's cutscene was great and I loved the difficulty spike they were from Ruby and Sapphire. (Looking at you Tate and Liza)
9. Sun & Moon - I think these games have a better story than their successors in terms of Lillie, but I don't have as much personal experience and investment with them as I do with USUM and they don't have as much content so they rank lower. Other than that, all my problems with Gen 7 still stand.
10. Ruby & Sapphire - I admit I have limited experiences with these games, they seem fine, but Emerald and ORAS fix many of the issues I have with them. (Emerald ups the difficulty, ORAS has a more interesting story, both have better postgames.) As I said before though, Hoenn has too much water. These are middle of the road games for me. I also agree that Hoenn's regional Dex and Pokemon designs are 
11. X & Y - These games aren't that bad in my opinion, but between the dumbing down of boss battles, excessive Gen 1 pandering and unremarkable story, I can see why people dislike these games so much. However, it also introduced some of the best designs in the series despite there being less Pokemon and the almighty power of Mega Evolution, which I found to be an interesting concept. This is another middle of the road game for me, but is lower than RS because of how poorly Mega Evolution was handled. (looking at you, Mega Mewtwo X and Y)
12. Red & Blue - I admit, these games may be a glitchy mess, but that's part of what makes them so entertaining, watching Jrose11's videos and finding out just how bad the AI is is hilarious and interesting and while I do agree for the most part that these games haven't aged well, I still have fond memories of playing Pokemon Blue on my Dad's old Gameboy, then Red on the virtual console. Also, like I said before, the story is done well for how simple it is. The problems I have with it are obvious; the AI is bad, grinding's atrocious, there are as many meh Pokemon as there are good ones and there's nothing to do after catching Mewtwo.
13. Sword & Shield - Keep in mind I've only played through the main campaign but these were the only games I felt guilty for enjoying. The story was the worst in the series apart from the Gym Battles and while Raid Battles were fun for a time, I didn't like the commercialised nature Pokemon was going in, which really turned me off wanting to spend my time and money on the Isle of Armour and Crown Tundra. Adding to this, the Pokemon designs weren't super well done in my opinion with a few exceptions and the Pro-National Dex protestors made me feel guilty for not boycotting the game.
14. Gold & Silver - I honestly don't like these games, they embody all of the problems I have with HGSS, but with next to none of their redeeming qualities. To add to this, they're just too easy, I might have had trouble with Whitney's Miltank before, but with my experience on the virtual console I was able to beat it easily. The AI in general in these games isn't great and most of the Johto Pokemon are forgettable, not being helped by the fact that again, Johto is infested with Kanto Pokemon. Gen 2 is in a weird spot overall when it comes to Pokemon I think; It lacks the buggy entertainment factor that Gen 1 provided, but isn't advanced enough to compare to Gen 3's innovation when it came to Abilities.

40334,">why the downvotes you dipshits? 12th gen intel is buggy, pricey, and runs hot. I am providing sound advice.

12th gen is not ""buggy"" as there are very simple fixes that let games run just fine. This wont (And isn't even now just by turning off e-cores with the press of a button) be an issue.

Its not really pricey either. The CPU itself is the best price/perf by far and has the most upcoming upgradability (With PCIE gen 5, potential DDR5 upgrades down the line if you want to keep your CPU, completely new CPU architecture that will be adopted by AMD too, way more lanes/m2 slots/new gen usb ports/things you just don't and can't get for those cheap $100 B550 boards).

It also only runs hot under very specific scenarios that 95% of users will never run. Under gaming it runs better then anything on the AMD side most of the time, or at worst about equal.

Everything you said is fairly wrong. There's no reason as of today, 11/16/21 to be going with AMD and a 5600/5800x unless you are looking to save $100 and really cant afford spending the extra.

TL;DR: The $100 extra for a $200 z690 DDR4 board is worth the extra money. And the CPU is better at the same price range. And you get way better futureproofing. And it runs less hot at \*most\* tasks aside from stress testing reasons. And the ""buggy"" aspect is overrated and easily fixed and reverted once your done playing one of the 50 games that doesn't work (And will probably get fixed anyway).",best midrange CPU

22396,"After college, I was living the intern life in New York, so I had to hunt around for a job that would be fine with me working just evenings. The first call I got was Kmart, so for about a month, I worked at Kmart Penn Station. 

One night, this guy with his hat pulled down low and this really cheerful girl came into the electronics department where I worked. It was a wild, wild store with tons of sketchy characters, so right away I was wary of him. Anyhow, they looked at the game selection for a minute, then the girl asked me if they could get Madden 2013. I obliged, took it from the case and began cashing them out. It was over the $50 minimum where I had to ask for ID with a credit card purchase, so I asked the sketchy fella for his ID. He told me, in this hushed little voice that he didn’t have it with him. 

Mhm. So I called up security to get the okay to finish up the transaction. As I’m talking to them, he tilts the credit card towards me. My first thought is, “huh. I didn’t know JP Morgan made a credit card?!” And then I looked at the name. 

Daniel Radcliffe. His girlfriend was beaming at me as the expected recognition washed over my dumb, tired face. He was super super gracious, and my height, which I loved even more (we’re both a firm 5’ 5”). 

And, I was pleased to be so calm and collected about the whole thing that they both got out of there without anyone else knowing who he was.",best celebrity
