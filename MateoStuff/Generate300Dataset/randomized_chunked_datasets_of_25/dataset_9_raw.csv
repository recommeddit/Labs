I'm happy with my TUF.

"Saxx was definitely a life changer for me. Yes, they’re expensive, but not having things sticking together down there is worth it"
"I would recommend this [Acer Predator Helios 300] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CTHLX8C/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 8th generation, i7 hexa core CPU which is one of the best in the market and great for your usage, 16GB of ram for smooth multitasking, good SSD storage of 256GB for faster boot up and loading, 15.6 inch Full HD IPS 144Hz screen which is a must have for this price range, high build quality, GeForce GTX 1060 GPU that should be able to handle games on medium to high settings with very good FPs, decent battery life, very good heat management, backlit keyboard, and it’s within your budget.
 
If you don't like this option then I would recommend that you check my [best gaming and college laptop](https://old.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/8ttl9m/list_of_the_best_available_laptops_for_gaming_and/) to compare it with similar options."
Anybody else enjoying putting a country to the flair in this thread?
"Here's info on bottled water and how they fall in regard to ideal brewing:

 [https://coffeeadastra.com/2018/12/16/water-for-coffee-extraction/](https://coffeeadastra.com/2018/12/16/water-for-coffee-extraction/) 

Then go to the sidebar and click on 'Bottled Water Spreadsheet'

It links to a Google Doc. I didn't want to post that directly as you wouldn't know where it's going.

The better option would be a gallon of distilled + baking soda & epsom salt or Third Wave Water if you're lazy. The link I posted says much more if you're interested."
"You want candy that is just bad enough that no kids will take it but good enough where you can tolerate eating it yourself. I think Almond Joys, butterscotch candies and those pineapple looking things."
I wish it was more common cause the sound is so cool

"Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) about three years ago I was in New York and saw him in the broadway play ""It's only a play""

Afterwards I saw a heap of people walking around the exit and the cast were going to their cars, I saw him and shouted out ""G'day Rupert!"" he stopped and saw me, came over and asked if that was an Australian accent, I replied yes and we had a chat about how much he loves Australia and Kangaroos. 

Also got a selfie with him but he's still got some makeup on so he looks a bit like a zombie in it."
"I guess Hitler could have been respected by many people due to the fact that he was in the position to make a mess out of Europe alone, not that he was 'respected by the people' in that sense. So it opens the argument into a huge can of worms destroyed by semantics. Which probably means I need to revise the question. 

I would really like to have a Vietnamese person answer due to Ho Chi Minh... I think they might have some interesting info because people seem to all rate him highly (I guess I would as well if the west had been bashing on me for decades). Thailand sure love their King, but seemingly always hate their political parties. 

I'm hoping to find a leading politician in the world at some stage respected by most people, irrespective of their ethos. I'm thinking Lincoln  is probably to controversial due to the war situation."

Definitely has the feel of an adventure movie more than a superhero movie.
Around what period was the Hungarian National team successful? Also who were their most well known players? I only really know Gabor Kiraly and Zoltan Gera
"Major Points about most characters are not explained in the game. For instance : Who is Avalach and why does he have a beef with Eredin? What is Wild Hunt and why do they want Ciri so hella much ? Relationship of Yennefer and Geralt? Ciri's bloodline and lineage? 

Those points are hella important to understand the story yet games do not explain it but books does . Games do expand the book's story thus makes it hard to understand for only game fans"
