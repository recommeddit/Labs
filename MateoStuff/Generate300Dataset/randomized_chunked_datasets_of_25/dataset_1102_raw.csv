"No.

I remember drinking a full can of Monster for a biology lab last year and my nerves were shot. I got the whole eye twitching, shaking hands type-deal. It kept me up, but it also made me feel uncomfortable and jumpy. Instead, I'll just take a short walk or a nap to wake me up."
"Day: Jo Malone - Peony and Blush Suede.  
Night: YSL - Black Opium.

I've also had a lot of compliments years ago with a cologne Salvador Dali by Salvador Dali. It... is very commanding and mysterious."
"I think the issue is that the majority of reviewers see playing games only as a job, so a game that's easier to progress through is ""better"" because it takes less time to complete.  
In the meantime, I dropped FM7 after 1 hour for the same reason as you."
Any old *Whose Line Is It Anyway?* compilations i can dig up. Except for Hoedown. Screw that game.

"I've thought about it, but haven't tried... The uncooked mix is very wet, and when I transfer it to the muffin tin I like to fill it a bit above the edges. Plus, it tends to expand a little when cooked, and I don't want an overflow disaster. (I may be overthinking this)"
Try aqua regia. It leaves you with that deep clean as well.
Is there like a telegram bot ?
"I’m fine with someone thinking it’s overrated on an individual level. All the better if they have actual points of criticism they honestly want to talk about! But on a subreddit level sometimes it feels a little cult-like and like the only opinion you’re allowed to have. I don’t mean to shit on people who don’t like BP, I’m just beyond tired of talking about it. If BP, T’Challa, Killmonger, etc. come up in the comments of a thread about all the movies, it seems like people trip over themselves to be the first ones to say it was overrated.

It’s gotten to the point that whenever anything about the movie is praised at all, I’m prepping myself for a ton of negativity from others about it.  I get real Last Jedi vibes from it and it’s just draining and not fun to talk about anymore."
None I was directly involved in but I was surprised that at least one room every weekend is evicted.  People throw loud parties or try to fit 50 people in a room.  Once a couple was evicted for having sex outside their room.  For a while there was a young woman who was a long term guest that every night would hang out at the bar and bring married men travelers up to her room.
"Thanks for the info, i just wanted to know if it was reliable, it's the first VPN I've used so i can't say I'm much of an expert..."
"Huge Boss Deep Red, and Versace Blue Jeans... mmmm"
$40 waterpik water flosser. For the first time in my life I have decent teeth.
"Yeah, but their resources are limited to cheaper materials. I have fake aviator and clubmasters of Ray-Bans from China and bought real ones a bit after. The difference is night and day."
I'm an analyst. I accidentally automated out a co-workers job with about 1000 lines of VBA.
Talking Biotech is awesome. It covers a wide variety of topics and features interviews with fantastic scientists!
Never too late to enjoy gaming

r/qutebrowser is pretty damn good.
"The natural drama of his life was genuine, inspiring, and eye opening to how big the culture of F1 is.  Easily my favorite documentary on Netflix, maybe even my favorite of all time"
"It could be worse, for sure :).

Ha, I admit I'm not an expert on this, but my dad used to take me along on some of his fishing trips along the coast and streams in Denmark. Along the coast I know you can catch sea trout, Atlantic cod, garfish, herring, coalfish and I think mackarel as well.

In the freshwater streams, you can catch perch, river trout and sturgeon (and a bunch of others, but these two I'm pretty sure of)."

80%? More like 95%. Also what is his opinion on electric toothbrushes? Do they make a difference if you know how to brush your teeth propperly with circular motion and use curaprox 5460 toothbrushes?
"I second this—Irish whistle music is really fun to play, sounds impressive, and is relatively easy to get to an intermediate level in!"
