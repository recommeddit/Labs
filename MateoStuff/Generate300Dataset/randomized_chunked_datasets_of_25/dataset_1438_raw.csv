put your definition in the description. hope you dont mind.
"Tobey best movies

Andrew best performance"

"Milan 20-25 years ago. Against them, Pep's Barcelona would have had something like 70-80% ball possession without ever managing to shoot on goal, considering their defence and Pep's obsession with never shooting from outside the box."
Thanks for making this post OP I'm kinda in the same boat
classic raw realness

This. Been great for me.
Having people tell you these movies have great twists kinda ruins their twist.
"I agree Brad is a great teacher, i didn't knew about new crash course, will check it our, thanks"
"What tweaking do people need?  I am genuinely curious because as you said, it works right out of the box.  I am just wondering why people would need to mess with it?  So they can see ads on specific sites?"
I really enjoyed the story. But after initially beating it and getting back to it a couple years later the controls felt very dated. But that might not be the case for you.  It's a great game. And most likely very cheap. And the dlc is actually worth it. It's a little harder than your average rpg but not souls like. You just have to prepare
Or any Hitchcock film for that matter. I'd recommend Vertigo as well.
"Yeah but you might as well as go with sennheisers when you go down a tier.  The k702s are great for music, and are amazing for gaming.  They are $254 dollars on Newegg.  I wouldn’t sacrifice detail for money. With headphones you need to make leaps not steps up.  With the k702 I can accurately place the virtual speaker arcs on Dolby headphone, using my asus xonar.  You won’t find better at this price."
"There was a story on reddit a while ago about a guy and his Jansport. He was sitting on a bench and a guy asked him what happened to the zipper. It got caught in a door or something and became disfigured. Turns out the guy was the CEO of Jansport and ordered him a replacement right away. They are well made and last, would recommend to a reddit friend."
The NE (Electric) Miata. Would be perfect.
"I haven't tried nnn, but I love ranger. Ranger is much faster for me to use than either a GUI file manager or a the standard bash tools.

Granted, I don't use it for everything. If I know the file I want, 

    $ cp ~/my_file.txt ~/Documents/my_file_copy.txt

And the like are much more convenient than opening ranger.

But if I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, or just want to browse my files, ranger saves so much time over

    cd ~/foo; ls ~/foo; cat bar.txt

rinse, repeat."

">  It's not like they're dropping multiple otter loads at once. You're still just dealing with one load of people at a time.

There are many boogies that do EXACTLY that. Plus a helicopter, etc. And you put a Twin Otter at a DZ that normally has a 182 and there is a BIG difference. Or at a place like Zhills that will be flying two Otters and will have them dropping while the other load is landing. 

Like I said... People are going to disagree, but the only defense will be ""It is not that bad"".... I disagree."
Calmer than you are.
"Depending on how much money you can spend, I would go somewhere sort of cheap, or somewhere sort of expensive, and it depends on what you want to see, but I would suggest, either a huge city like New York (which generally has amazing food), or some sort of beach, because some of the beaches in America are really nice. I would do some additional research on prices and things like that so your trip is really nice. :)"
"If the op deletes the post, the content of the post will be visible for us, yes?
I'm asking because I wanna star it, but I'm not sure what is gonna happen if he deletes it in the future for whatever reason."
