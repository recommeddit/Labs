30185,"I had 'California history' in the fourth grade in the mid 1980s.  They didn't say much on it.  Just that the Anglos who started the Bear Flag Republic were heroic rebels and then California was annexed and everything was as it ought to be.  They even showed us a movie that portrayed as much.

They also glossed over what happened to the California Indians and gave a rosy picture of the Missions.  That was pretty typical for the time, and I presume it was all the more so for previous generations.",best Mexican war to study

15472,"u/ZumboPrime has given you quite a good list, and here are some plants that will be complementary to their reccomendation.

&#x200B;

Instead of magnolia (which honestly is a bit overused), try these trees at the back: Amelanchier canadensis, Cercis canadensis, Cornus alternifolia (which has a variegated variety called ""argentea"" - really pretty, but will need some darker back drop to really pop). I would use all three and space them 10' apart, in clusters. 

For shade / accent tree: Nyssa sylvatica, or (non native, but so, so, so pretty) Acer palmatum 'sango kaku'.

I would also use a few evergreens at the back to create privacy: Abies lasiocarpa, Abies balsamea, Pinus cembra. 

&#x200B;

Shrubs: Cornus sericea is very nice, but if you want something similar but larger, Cornus racemosa. Viburnum lentago is basically the same size and somewhat similar in fall colour, but the flowers are more conspicuous. Aronia arbutifolia 'brilliantissima' is *beautiful* in spring and fall, and the flowers are fragrant. 

You might want to try Salix integra 'hakuro nishiki'. If left alone (unpruned), it will overtime form an graceful, arching shrubs.

What you really should do is to have your soil tested at a lab - I recommend SGS. Most plants would like a pH of 6.5-7.2, and an organic matter content of 5-10%.",best tree for the garden
