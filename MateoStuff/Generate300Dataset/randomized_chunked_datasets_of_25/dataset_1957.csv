3477,best college for research,"I always saw Brown as more prestigious than Northwestern. 

It offers stronger undergrad education, and is harder to get into, and 65% of people who get into Brown and Northwestern pick Brown."
70111,best major to study in college,"The problem is, though, that some people who study these subjects never even think about what they will do with them later on. While it's all good and well to ""learn for life"", you should never start a course that will probably make your job hunt difficult without knowing yourself what you'll use it for.

Those courses are important as they enrich our culture, and I sure as hell would not want only engineers and chemists running around. But do some thinking before deciding to take one of those courses.."

35552,best alcoholic drink,"My friends and I have called them Blind Russians for years, but no one ever knows what I'm talking about. I was beginning to think that it was all in my head, that maybe, in reality, I have no friends and no memories of my drunken interactions with them ordering ""Blind Russians,"" I have only fantasies of a life lived in the outside world involved with other humans with whom I have true relationships with. All this time in this god damn cave watching the shadows dance on the walls in the faint light of the flickering fire has really fucked with my head.

Fuck Yeah! Blind Russians!!"
47049,best hand santizer brand,"""99.99%"" is more or less a marketing safety net, as they can't just say 100%. The alcohol in virtually all hands sanitizers will kill any bacteria it comes in contact with, for reasons explained in other comments, but in the case of bacteria lucky enough to be missed when applying the sanitizer, it's just safer to say ""99.99%"".

Similar with the ""99.9%"" chance of preventing pregnancy with condoms. Sometimes pregnancy does occur due to user error or manufacturing defect."
