47049,"""99.99%"" is more or less a marketing safety net, as they can't just say 100%. The alcohol in virtually all hands sanitizers will kill any bacteria it comes in contact with, for reasons explained in other comments, but in the case of bacteria lucky enough to be missed when applying the sanitizer, it's just safer to say ""99.99%"".
