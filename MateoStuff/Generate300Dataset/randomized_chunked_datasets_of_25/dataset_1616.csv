23327,best car racing video game,"Forza Horizon 3 - More arcadey, fun for collecting and customising tons of cars and doing crazy builds.

Assetto Corsa - Pretty realistic sim but not too full on - Tones of easy to install mods for more cars and tracks which i recommend checking out

rfactor 2 - If you want a really realistic sim to test your driving skills

Project Cars - Not as realistic as Assetto corsa and rfactor but more of a sim racer with more polish and better graphics and a good career more

Dirt Rally - Only realistic Rally game worth owning IMO"
