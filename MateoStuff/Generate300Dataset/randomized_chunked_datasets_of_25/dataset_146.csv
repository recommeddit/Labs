> In fact, the main reason `clone()` exists is to allow multiple uses of `Body` objects (when they are one-use only.)

This is just a property of streams, which is what HTTP responses are, and therefore what the `fetch` spec uses. In general, once data has been consumed from a stream, it can't be consumed again from that same stream (i.e. streams are ""single-consumer""). If you want to read a given stream multiple times it needs to be split ([""teed""](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/tee)) first, which I assume is what `.clone()` does under the hood.

The issue with `response.json()` is that it reads the stream (consumes it) then tries to parse it as JSON, in a single expression. If the parsing part fails, then there's no way to retrieve the data that has already been read.",axios alternatives reddit
