"I am surprised no one has recommended a redbud. There are all sorts of varieties.  For instance a red leaf variety like Forest Pansy would look great. 

If you do go with a large tree I would highly recommend an oak. they naturally grow with a great shape. I would not go with a maple for a variety of reasons."

"I bought a decent number of boxes of sculpting clay once and brought them back in my checked luggage. They're they kind that concept artists use to sculpt things for movies or action figures, they come in brick sized blocks and half my case was probably taken up by them.

I'm not surprised they fucked up my luggage that time, to be honest."

Citizen Kane is a classic twist
Waking life
Ray Ban is shit? Part of the sunglasses monopoly lol
"Aw, geez. You gave me an emotion there, how dare you. Thanks! In the words of Galadriel, “May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out.”"
“I brought you flours” is one of my favourite lines. 😢
"He's a homophobic dudebro asshat. It was on in the background at a friend's house, and I heard way too much."
"Your list is pretty good, we share three series in our top"

"Oh, absolutely. I started hanging out in the newsroom of my school the first week of my freshman year. It boggles my mind how there were journalism majors who just didn't want to get involved but were still convinced their degree would get them by."
Yeah I've tried my friend's speed switches and I cannot stand them I ended up pressing all the buttons by accident
"best one imo is the acer predator xb271hu. there is an asus variant of it as well that is the same panel but slightly more expensive due to better frame. i have the predator and i think its the best 1440p panel out there. it's like 500 bucks on sale with 27inches, 1440p, 165hz, IPS (the reason i went with this one), g-sync, HDMI +DP, and a pretty deep settings menu. i think there is a new variant of it from both manufacturers with hdr, but from what i read it's not ""true"" hdr as it's less than 1000 nits peak brightness."
"I don’t know Really. But what makes the MBP displays so nice is the combination of Resolution, colors and the viewing angles."
"Yes, `AbortController` is rather new and it cannot be polyfilled. [https://caniuse.com/#feat=abortcontroller](https://caniuse.com/#feat=abortcontroller)

Use `XMLHttpRequest` and `XMLHttpRequest.abort()` instead if you need to close connection when `AbortController` is unavailable."
"Synthetic thyroid hormones.  Seriously, they are what keep me human and functioning.  $20 a month and I'm functioning well.  Last month I skipped three days of medication, and I was freezing and feeling pukey and gross.

Have hypothyroidism and it sucks ass."
"We just can't do anything right in Nebraska, can we?"
I did not know there was a Mexican America war either. I’m from a northern/Midwestern state so further from the border. We likely touched on it briefly in elementary and/or middle school but it was not a very significant portion of our history lessons
Yeup. Whites sans Hispanics are 2/3 the US population more or less.

"Killer Queen by Katy Perry. I was skeptical at first.. but it smells amazing and my husband loves it. I used it as my daily fragrance.

However! Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture will always be my all time favorite. Honorable mention: Very Sexy by Victoria Secret makes me want to take my own clothes off."
