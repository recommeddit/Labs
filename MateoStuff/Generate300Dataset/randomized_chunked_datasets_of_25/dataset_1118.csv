33915,"Not sure who downvoted you, but I respectfully disagree. I didn't play B/W until about two years ago, and as someone that considered Gen 1 and 2 my favorites, with everything after being somewhat downhill, I think Black and White and the sequels have the most competent stories of the entire series. It did something different and exciting, I felt, with the evil team formula, and wove it more cohesively into your gym challenge than any other Pokemon game has before, or since, especially the climactic set piece during the Elite Four. If I remember correctly, you don't even beat the Elite Four until after you see the credits for the first time? My gripes with a lot, if not all of the Pokemon games, is that the world-ending crisis your child avatar is thrown into, somehow felt like a sidebar to you completing the gym/Elite Four Challenge, with the credits rolling after. B/W meshed them together in a way that I was pleasantly surprised by.  
  
To other complaints about the generation, I had only seen Pokemon designs like Klink and Vanilluxe lambasted, but I've found Gen 5 also introduced some of my favorite Poke designs like Galvantula and Chandelure, and while I'm not sure how I would rate the region overall, I felt like the geography was a departure from previous games, but also had half the world map locked until you beat the E4, meaning more post-game content.  
  
All that to say, I feel like B/W/2 have actually aged fairly well, and served as a great 'soft reboot' to the series, but probably not what I would recommend playing first.",best Pokemon game

But I do remember the motel we stayed at along the Merced river, the rushing water, the bats flying along the waterway on the fall evening.

58938,"It's fantastic but not the sort of thing you'd wear everyday. It's not oud at all. Blast of smoke up top like a fire after it's been put out. Also has a candy lemon sweetness that picks up over 30 mins until it's on level with the smoke. Works really well together and isn't cloying or too agressive, although you wouldn't wear it to work. You'd wear this on cold days outdoors. Performance is also very strong. It's lovely and another one which for the price has fantastic quality. Try to get a sample first since it's quite heavy if that's not your thing. Also I've heard it's a convincing clone of Amouage Interlude but since I've never tried that one I can't speak to it.",best perfume
