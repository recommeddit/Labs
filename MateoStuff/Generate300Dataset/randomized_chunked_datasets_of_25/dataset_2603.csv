25571,best cricket teams of all time,"No worries mate! Pretty good squad though, Ive only been watching cricket for about 20-25 years so its much easier to make a best XI of this era. 

My XI would be:

Smith (SA)

Hayden (Aus)

Ponting (c) (Aus)

Tendulkar (Ind)

Sangakkara (SL)

Kallis (SA) - Criminal to have him batting at 6, but cant put him above any of the others and he is the best all rounder by far. 

Gilchrist (wk) (Aus)

Warne (Aus)

Akram (Pak)

Steyn (SA)

McGrath (Aus)

-----

Very hard to choose between Donald/Akram and Sangakkara/Lara."
