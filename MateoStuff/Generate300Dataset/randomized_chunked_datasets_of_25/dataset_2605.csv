26171,"I'm going to go very unconventional and pick **Robert Byrd**. (Hes the guy in that ""kkk member kissing Clinton"" meme that people post without understanding the history.) My choice is not for his policies, or overall impact, but because of the life he lived. He's a great example of someone who started out with a very sheltered and ignorant view of the world and through reasoning, a willingness to listen, and the courage to self-reflect transformed from a KKK member into someone the NAACP regarded as a ""great loss"" upon his death. 

It's worth reading at the very least the Wkiipedia entry if you don't know all that much about him, [especially the part concerning his views on race.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd#Race)

I think his life story would make for a great movie, specifically if what was a Sorkin-style look at the time when his grandson died and how that made him change his world view, maybe with flashbacks to segments of his earlier life choices.",best politician
