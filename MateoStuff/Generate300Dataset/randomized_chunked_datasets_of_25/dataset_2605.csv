61867,Best RPG game on PS4,"HZD isn't an RPG, but Bloodborne and Witcher are? You have some weird criteria.

Not saying HZD is an RPG, but if it isn't, neither are the other two."

Personally I have everything I could need and really just want some free time to hit the gun range.  My wife is getting pictures made of our kids which is very nice and doesn’t have to be too expensive."
26171,best politician,"I'm going to go very unconventional and pick **Robert Byrd**. (Hes the guy in that ""kkk member kissing Clinton"" meme that people post without understanding the history.) My choice is not for his policies, or overall impact, but because of the life he lived. He's a great example of someone who started out with a very sheltered and ignorant view of the world and through reasoning, a willingness to listen, and the courage to self-reflect transformed from a KKK member into someone the NAACP regarded as a ""great loss"" upon his death. 

It's worth reading at the very least the Wkiipedia entry if you don't know all that much about him, [especially the part concerning his views on race.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd#Race)

I think his life story would make for a great movie, specifically if what was a Sorkin-style look at the time when his grandson died and how that made him change his world view, maybe with flashbacks to segments of his earlier life choices."

40766,best instrument to play,"Guitar is really easy to pick up and learn quickly. You can also jam out with just about anybody if you can play the guitar. I do think the bass is more satisfying though, it's like building the song and putting everything into context, making it a cohesive structure. Banjo is also pretty great, but nobody ever wants to hear that sweet, sweet hillbilly melody."

They’ve got the greatest batsman of all time (Bradman).
