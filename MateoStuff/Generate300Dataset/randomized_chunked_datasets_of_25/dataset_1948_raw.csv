I wrote my own once request got deprecated. It’s basically request but with built in promise support instead of callbacks. It is supports streaming to and from the request just like in “request” and it’s a tiny lib. [beggar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beggar)
"Thunar + PCManFM

I'll switch back to just Thunar once [this bug](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/-/issues/451) gets resolved."
I just watched this on your recommendation: that’s one holy-shit-man what-the-fuck movie.
"All of these. Don’t F**k with Cats isn’t for everyone. Icarus was really interesting. Athlete A was infuriating, but also really informative. 

And Tiger King, well, is like 2020 in a documentary."
"Add a lime to it, and you will never go back to fruitless vodka cranberry."
"I switched from 60hz to 75hz, and I can really tell the difference between the 2. The 75hz feels smoother while surfing on the internet and stuff. In games, the the difference is very minimal, but still better than 60hz."
"I have a pair of Oakley frogskins I really like. The plastic they use is really nice. It's light, and incredibly solid (you can bend the wings back 180 degrees without them breaking). That plus the hinge design makes them pretty much unbreakable. I know that Oakley is a contentious brand, but I think that model at least manages to to avoid the typical chunky Oakley style."
*Murder Mountain.*
"No love for Magoo's? Might depend on which location, but the upper east side one is great. Could be because my siblings and I went to Highland with one of the sons of the owners though. California style pizza like Rusty's."
"I think most of these are pretty good, however, I think they should have separate lists for lifting and cardio. I could see nearly all of these being good, but some inappropriate for my situation."
Too bad your mother didn't
"Tab completion + zsh is good enough that I never need anything else, but I do like ranger."
"Gin. She's got a bit of a problem, but at least she's easy to buy gifts for!"
"No, I just think phones look better without cases and I have insurance which is $20 to replace a cracked screen"
Pride and Prejudice.
Came to say this. Happy it was the top comment.
"Ah perfect, thanks! Let me PM you the original paragraph that spurred this existential crisis."
"My mechanical keyboard, I've got Cherry MX Browns."
"* N64   (Ocarina of Tima)
* GBA   (Pokemon Emerald)

* PS1   (Metal Gear Solid)

I share equal love to all of them."
"Disney is good if (a) you have kids, (b) you want to embrace your inner-child, or (c) you're a couple and want to feel that innocent high school type romance again

Universal is good for media fans, especially Harry Potter

Magic Mountain is good for roller coaster fans

havent been to Knott's in a long time, so can't advise you on the one

dont go to Sea World"
"Ehh, a lot of fish *can* live in bowls, but it's unless you're properly changing the water every other day and testing often for chemical levels, it's actually a pretty miserable experience for the fish. 

If you're doing it properly, a betta fish should have at least a five gallon tank, but ideally s ten. You should get a proper nitrogen cycle going in your tank before you even purchase your fish, and then it needs to be properly heated and filtered. 

Betta fish are marketed as easy to keep in a unfiltered, small bowl/trendy mason jars because ""they live in puddles"" in their natural habitat, but it's only for a very short dry season. In reality, they're long distance swimmers for being such small fish. With proper care, Bettas can live an average of 3-5 years captivity, and often longer. They have personalities, can learn tricks, and they do develop a sort of basic attachment to their caretakers. 

I don't mean anything against you personally! I just hate the misinformation spread by pet stores who benefit from selling as many as they can, and try to combat it as often as possible. It's cruel for the fish and disappointing for the child when their new pet passes away in a month from accidental poor care."
"agreed.

while lists are lists, we can't have the anteaters ahead of us. I mean, have you even visited? It's almost worse than the bobcats."
"Also, you know, it is imported from Fiji."
"I've got a few.  

* Two slices of bacon, cooked in the oven at 400 degress while I shower.  When I'm done, I take the bacon out, drain on paper towels while I cook two eggs in a about a teaspoon of bacon grease. 

Low fat version:

* Spray inside of glass measuring cup with cooking spray. Add 1/2 cup eggwhite, egg beaters, etc.  Nuke one minute while toasting English muffin with fat-free cheese.  Add egg ""patty"", salt & pepper, hot sauce - enjoy."
"Hey, that works! I loooove the Cali veggie pizza w/ goat cheese at CPK."
