Opera GX is really underrated on Desktop
"No love for magazines in these comments? It's the best thing to subscribe to in-print, IMO.

I subscribe to the New Yorker, the New Republic (great if you want a more left-wing perspective) and New York Magazine. Other good options are The Nation, Wired, Vanity Fair, GQ... lots more."
"My best friend's dad is a dentist, and I actually asked him this question a few years ago. His answer: modern toothpastes are all held to such a high standard that you really can't go wrong. It's more important that you brush properly and floss regularly."
"Voight is da bomb!!! What a hard ass.
Chicago PD is a great show, the writting, the actors, the violence... Love it all!"
I agree with your assessment of the movie of Starship Troopers 100%. Do you want to know more? :)
"Activated carbon doesn't tend to remove all the minerals.  Processes like reverse osmosis is where you see the complete removal of water constituents that may be harmful.

I'm unfamiliar with the negative repercussions of drinking distilled water exclusively, but it is my understanding that it is not ideal.  Someone with a medical background would likely have to chime in.  

My guess is that the difference in activity of the water will cause osmotic pressure differences internally which would not be good in your organs.  That coupled with missing out on some key micronutrients seems bad."
So that basically means you will never leave your own country then... Nice to make up such criteria it can not be satisfied by any other place than where you currently live.
"No he doesn't cook it first. It cooks in the oven, along with the eggs. Our pan only has six spaces, but the recipe could easily increase to make more servings if you have a larger muffin pan :)"
"Indeed, that is a great paper. I'd probably recommend [Communication in the presence of noise](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee104/shannonpaper.pdf) as a first read, though.

The historical context around the ideas in Shannon's papers is really interesting, especially how many of the same ideas were developed in Russia and Germany nearly simultaneously. It's both a fascinating paper and an interesting historical artifact."

"**Ronnie James Dio.**

I managed to sneak inside the backstage area after a Dio concert. My friend was too scared to ""get caught"", so he waited outside for me. 

The guy was one of the nicest persons *(celebrities)* I've ever met so far. We talked for about twenty minutes about more or less everything. I had totally forgot about my friend for those twenty minutes we had talked, but I asked Dio if it was okay for a friend of mine to come inside as well. I called my friend and told him that Dio said it was okay for him to come inside. My friend is extremely modest and told me that he didn't want to bother him. I then asked Dio if he could ask him to come inside. He took my phone and talked. ""Hey, it's Ronnie, do you want to..."". My friend hung up (he later told me that he really regretted doing it).

We talked a bit more until Dio asked me if I smoked. I told him that I didn't smoke, he just smiled and chuckled. ""Sorry, I didn't mean that kind of smoke"". He introduced me to my first joint. After he had smoked me out he asked me if I was hungry. 

We got served Italian food. Dio drank red wine with his food and I could wish for whatever drink I wanted. After the dinner he thanked me for staying for dinner and told me it was always a pleasure to hang out with fans.

"Somewhat related, I'm inheriting my father set of cast iron skillets when he dies. He has had a full set over 30 years. I might be looking forward to it, just slightly."
async/await based. You mean it just used promises like all the other ones?
Agreed. It’s a tough but necessary chore. Any particular strategies or conversations you use to dissuade unnecessary prescribing?

What is that?  It's not coming up in search on Netflix"
I live near Eglin AFB in Florida
Yes it is safe.
"Sorry it kept getting reposted friend, fantastic work!"
"`emacs` usually. I don't spend enough time in a Linux editor to keep `vi` paged in. While `emacs` is not exactly intuitive, it's a lot easier to find out things like the right `M-x command`. Also a few of the keystrokes are implemented by default in MacOS, which I use quite a bit (although I think there is a way to switch to `vi` keystrokes)."

"Anker!

[Anker PowerCore 20100mAh](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00X5RV14Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because they are so so cheap and reliable!

or

[Anker PowerCore+ 20100mAh](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B014ZO46LK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) if you have an item that needs more amperage. USB-C phones or Nintendo Switch, something that wants a little more oomf. Not that more exp.

We own two of each for our camper. We live on these things for a long trips. They're also under regulation size for all flights. Both not too bad for (mens) jeans or a jacket pocket for their capacity, kinda bulky but you aren't going to get slimmer for that size. Definitely comfortable to throw in your backpack for a hike. Durable so far (2 years of many many camping trips and flights home)"
"Couldnt have said it better myself, about both the movie and Robert Pattinson. I loved him in this movie and had ne er seen him in much else before. Had to watch it twice in less than 24 hours. Its not a perfect film by any stretch but it definitely hit me in a way that only Christopher Nolan seems capable of"
"Really? Now I have to check prices and availability on the game.  BRB thanks.

Looks like a viable and preferable option!  Thanks for letting me know!"
The song with Zach De La Roca is incredible
