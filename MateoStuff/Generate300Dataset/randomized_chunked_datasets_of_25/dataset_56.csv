9224,best toothpaste,"Some Crest rep gave your dentist a pile of that product so that his patients would see it and go out and buy it. Dentists DGAF and one of mine said plain baking soda would be good enough. My great-uncle died at 85 with all his teeth in great shape and only ever used baking soda. (Still, I went out and bought pricey Crest 3D White last week to see if it will get rid of my stains :)"
66935,best soccer team in the world,Spain wasn't really that good until recently
46113,best trick or treating candy,"The list is certainly made up by kids, because they mistakenly think we care where we fall on the list - What youâ€™ll get is what we can tolerate at the office as leftovers for the following week.

Iâ€™ll agree with this; if one is giving fruit and tooth brushes on halloween, donâ€™t bother. Shut off your lights and go to bed - youâ€™re wasting their time you schmuck."

65754,best college in california,There's no #23. If there's an actual scoring system instead of just random rankings its possible they got they same score.

27790,best breakfast foods,"An egg sandwich. Sharp cheddar cheese, some bacon, and a fried egg on a bagel or croissant."
3387,best webcamera,"The only reason I still recommend the c920 is because it regularly goes on sale for half off everywhere, and dollar for dollar, it will retain quality and give a huge bang for your buck.

Buying something cheap and then going to a 920 in a year isn't helpful cuz it's much more expensive to do so long run. Better to just not use a cam save another 20 or 30 bucks and buy the half price 40 or 50 dollar c920.

It's not like you need to save up an extra 100 bucks - it's 20 or 30. You can do that shovelling some driveways or mowing some lawns for a few extra bucks."

8901,best toothpaste,"This is where the whole ""4 out of 5 dentists"" saying comes into play."
33737,best electric car,"Do you have electricity at home? Then the number of charger in your town is not necessarily a concern. I charge my EV from a wall outlet on my house, with no issues. And you also don't need a ""full charge"" you only need enough for the drive you're about to do. If I need to run a 20 mile errand and I'm at 180/264 charge, I don't wait for 264 to go.

Battery life is a non-issue for most people. Model S and X vehicles are getting over 200k from their packs. 

Unlike a cell phone or laptop, car batteries have significant reserves - you don't charge to 0 and 100%, you charge to like 10 and 90% which keeps the battery healthier longer."

55114,best places to hike in the east coast,"love the photo dude! I mentioned it already here, but I snapped a nice shot on film at that spot too - http://imgur.com/pSAGUey. Really liking your portfolio too! How do you like the XT1 for outdoor photography?"
43290,best detective show,If you like medical procedurals (I see The Good Doctor on your list) I suggest giving ER a spin. 15 seasons to enjoy (some are obviously better than others) and since Michael Crichton was involved it's semi accurate.
18723,best YouTube video,"If you don't like those, there's always Freeman's Mind, a really good Half-Life machinima."
69781,best major to study in college,"Be wary of the popular advice on this thread: ""Major in anything STEM."" I'd put my money on the majority of FI people on this forum are STEM folks who sit in front of their computers all day, hating their jobs... but thats another topic all together. I think Reddit threads in are generally a bad place for these kinds of questions because of selection bias. Just wanted you to keep that in mind. There is plenty of good news for a lot of STEM majors, but not all of them. You can find a lot of articles supporting STEM. Here are some contrary to consider: 

https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm -- Key point: Surplus in academia STEM.
http://www.businessinsider.com/college-majors-producing-the-highest-unemployment-rates-2017-10 -- Key point: Biology and Environmental Science majors have some of the highest unemployment rates.
https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-130.html -- Key point: Majority of STEM graduates do not work in STEM 

In my opinion, you should consider if you really love a STEM field? Are you good at math? Do you like using a computer for the majority of the day? If not, there are a plentitude of opportunities out there, with only an undergraduate degree being the minimum qualification."

25239,best spiderman actor,"Tom > Andrew > Tobey for both Peter Park and Spider-Man, in my opinion. While the Tobey movies were better, I thought Andrew did a better job of portraying the character."
67793,axios alternatives reddit,"Solid choice. What I think node-fetch does better is that they're using the [AbortController API for cancellation](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#request-cancellation-with-abortsignal). The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn cancelable promises proposal.

An interesting observation is that Axios is much popular when you look at repo stars (78k vs 5.6k) but in terms of NPM downloads node-fetch tops the list (19M weekly installs vs 13.5M). https://www.npmtrends.com/node-fetch-vs-axios-vs-got"
