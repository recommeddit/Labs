"The Spanish Civil War is missing right there, in between the great depression and WW2. A war among two different monarchists, radical catholics, rich, fascists, democrats, poor, anarchists, communists, russians, germans, italians... Nearly every ideology in the world fought that war. There were even civil wars within the Civil War, coups d'etat on one side, the lot. In the meantime, the whole world was awaiting the outcome to see what would happen in the rest of Europe; nobody who mattered on the democracy side (France, Britain, the US) did shit because they were too scared about bothering Hitler in some way.

Maybe in 200 years' time we'll see it as the European Wars. It all started with the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and finished with the Yugoslav War of the 90's, the collapse of the USSR, and the reunification of Germany."
"yeah, Iodine is a halogen and thus oxidizes compounds pretty well. When disinfecting or inactivating microorganisms, what is actually occurring is that the disinfectant is oxidizing the microorganism and killing it. So iodine is behaving much like chlorine would.

I believe that iodine used to be used in swimming pools.  The drawback to iodine is color and taste. I'm not sure that it is AS effective as bleach, I've not really looked into it."
Check out [Forging Divinity](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24929067-forging-divinity). It's got pretty solid action and interesting magic. It's a quick read and not too dark.
Borrowing is actually a better idea. It's a great way to get all of your friends and family wanting electric cars too when they drive yours and see how much better they are.

"Ye Iâ€™m still using this 100 buck asus monitor I got for free from someone.  

I also have this TV screen-ish screen as a secondary and it displays the colors much better.  

Iâ€™m guessing the TV screen is IPS and I know the Asus PC monitor is TN."

"Hmm, at the moment most lightweight mice (<80 grams) are wired. There might be several new wireless lightweights coming out this year, Wireless Hati, GPW X, Wireless Finalmouse. Current options are obviously Viper U and the GPW. Both of those are expensive though, and I own neither so others could probably be more informative. The GPW does have time on its side though, and the only issue people report consistantly is double clicks.

I don't know what I would do if I were you, the Model O would probably be a less expensive way to experience a lightweight ambi mouse. Their new cable looks fantastic so I'd make sure to get a current unit. So yeah, unless you're in a rush to try wireless tech, I'd try a wired mouse that's vastly different from the DA, just so you know what kind of shape and weight you like."

"Get something personalized. Yeah, you could get a gift card to that sporting goods store or a case of beer, but something personalized to your father will tug your father's emotional strings, and that's the greatest thing you can do."

"I agree, crystal is the best game in the series.  
It perfected the original formula but also introduced some of the more engaging story features that the later games hinge on.  
Plus a end game that no other game in the series has yet to match short of HG or SS which are still missing the aspects that made Crystal great."

"""Find that one perfect fragrance for you, and use ONLY that. You should NOT have a variety of scents based on the situation or your mood. They are NOT like clothes. Your fragrance should serve as an subtle, pleasant, reminder of you. An unconscious reference, but it has to become that over time. That won't happen if you alternate scents. Do - not - alternate - scents""

This statement is very, very debatable and very, very opinionated. And that is a supper strong opinion. Personally, I disagree, and I bet 99% of people into fragrances share my opinion. Some fragrances are designed for certain situations, or are just more appropriate. I wouldn't where a fragrance that projects heavily and smells very strong and weird to work for instance. I might however, wear it at a bar or something.

I just find your opinion on this incredibly harsh. I understand that it is an opinion, but the way it is worded just comes off as combatant against others who disagree.

Why do you feel fragrances are so static, and should never be alternated? I like to look appreciate fragrances and their effect on scent memory and association.

I hope no one reads your comment and takes your opinion as something other than that, and never discovers how amazing fragrances can be.

Also, Macy's fragrance department is sometimes staffed by contractors from a fragrance house. They are extremely biased because their job is not to sell you anything other than the house they represent."

"Stop your defensive fanboyism and assumptions.  Many of your points are true in general but a bit dogmatic handled. 

Anyway, the comment was about the article not Axios. I haven't used Axios, but I don't think that should be required to read an article about it, it should stand on it's own merit."
"great game. i played maybe a month tops, the reason i left is because i couldnt get ieyasu and even though i got to mid game boss fights that were fun, gems were slowing down and im a completionist type that doesnt like to grind. really though i had 90% of the characters very fast its worth playing"
