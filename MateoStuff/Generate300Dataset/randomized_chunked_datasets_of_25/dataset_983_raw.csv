"No, that's in the other 50%. Horrible Bosses 2 however..."
"> You save 1 line, but have to pull in an entire library.

That feels like the Javascript motto tbh"
I'd say it is R1 for those subjects then. R1 != prestigious school.
"That Horizon is an RPG. It doesn’t have deep RPG mechanics but it has all the ones you listed. No need to downvote, dude."
"Anker battery pack.

The thickness of a slim wallet, profile of a credit card, and if I forget to charge it 5 times, it still has juice left."
I am not growing either of cupassu or the bicolor theobroma. I should look into it though as it is a fast producer. I prefer the Mahakea black kava. It is one of the most potent. The plant can take years to strengthen in medicinal qualities. Typically 4 but it gets better with time. We have a huge pant that is going on 30 years in age and quite potent. Once established and thriving cuttings can be made in the spring and you can sell the propagated plants.
"Since your current breakfast looks like a relatively fit meal:

**Oatmeal breakfast pancakes**

1:1 oatmeal:egg whites.

Splash in a little milk and puree the oatmeal/egg mixture in a blender. Add either cinnamon and some sugar or jalapeno and green onions if you want savory. Pour the mix into a nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook just like normal pancakes.

Alternatively, when I'm eating ""dirty"", I'll make breakfast sandwiches with English muffins, sausage, and cheese and then individually wrap them in paper towels and store them in the fridge. Then I can just microwave them the day that I eat them."

"I studied Theoretical Physics. My career prospects aren't that great either. 

I'm pretty handy with a crowbar though."
"LacyBardot, we are practically scent sisters and you have inspired me to create my own top 10 (a couple of mine are the same as yours; others of mine are very, very similar scents).  I need to sample the ones on your list that I've never smelled!  Thank you!!"
How is it boring? I also doubt that 100% lol
Utah; always has to be just a little bit different
Hahaha
Infinity war more than any of the other movies relied on all the other movies to support it. It's good as an in universe film but stand alone I could see someone not liking it.
"Running a cam at 1080p costs a lot more resources than you'd think. Any 16:9 ratio like 848x480 will suffice. With decent lighting and framing the composition, you should be better than half of the other streamer's out there."
When i click on that link it says the product is currently unavailable
More - it can be proved that this wasn’t the motive: the throttling disappears after replacing the battery
"I hope Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is going to be in there, not holding my breath though."
Whats the difference between the GL and the GN?
"if its a super young kid like, under 5, give out just one piece. trust me, the moms don't want to deal with these little kids and a giant bag of candy."
"I asked this above, but doesn't the constant use of an antibiotic increase the risk of developing antibiotic resistant bacteria in your mouth (and digestive system)?"
I don't think redditors got the memo.
I guess that’s true but I think I’d probably say it’s easy-ish to learn and get mediocre at but one of the harder instruments to master
"Japanese maple isn't typically cold hardy in zone 4, where I live and where OP lives. Maybe they'd survive with a thick layer of mulch in a protected area. Garden centers have alternatives that are similar style maples and cold hardy to zones 3 or 4."
