"A lot of times these days IT isn't so much a college program as a trade. Get certified, in order:

- CompTIA A+ Certification

- CompTIA Network+ Certification

- Either Microsoft Certified Technician, or Cisco Certified Network Specialist. Or both.

These certifications with prove to anyone you want to work for that you know your shit. I've seen people get jobs with this and no college while their college educated peers remain unemployed."
"My favourite tip for testing the paint after you’ve decided on a few options:

Get a piece of drywall, or a stiff board. Drywall is best. About 2’x2’ is the largest you need. 

Get sample pots of the colours you like and paint the drywall pieces. It’s nice to leave a 1” white border, in case the existing colour “interrupts” the sample colour. Get two coats if possible. 

This way you have giant paint samples that you can move to different rooms. 

Don’t just slap a couple brush strokes on a variety of walls to test it out. It doesn’t give you a good idea for one, and I’ve also seen colours go really funny because of the existing colour (a grey went totally purple tested on a bright yellow wall)."
I love how the original The Secret in Their Eyes ends. I suppose it's a twist but maybe others don't consider it that way. The whole movie's perfect to me though.
Which of these games are great to play with a 7yr old?
One of the Scandinavian countries. Probably Norway or Finland.
Donate money in their name to a cause they enjoy.  It'll let them know you care about what they think and they get the satisfaction of knowing that their name is on something they care about.

My former cat haaaaaaaated that thing and if I just picked it up (even if I didn't shake it), she run."
The Barkley Marathons
Best buy has them in stock and if you have a Micro Center near you you can check them as well. I picked mine up for $429 at micro center last weekend
"Thanks, I will try that"
"I totally fail to understand why people like Orson Scott Card's books.  Ready Player One?  Really?

Taking ONLY from the lists below I'd pick:

1. A Canticle for Liebowitz
2. Foundation
3. The Martian Chronicles
4. Neuromancer
5. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
6. Ubik
7. Solaris
8. A Scanner Darkly
9. Dune
10. Brave New World

As much as I love 1984 I really wouldn't consider that book science fiction.  To me the genius of that book is that it's always happening somewhere in the world, every day."
"Yeah, I agree. I drink one maybe once a week. half in the morning/half in the afternoon."
"Nice weasel phrasing there. The ""most recent"" fatality is also, to the best of my knowledge, the only one. So your claim about this being ""disproportionate"" is patently false, especially if you consider, as you should, that Lodi sends up tens of thousands of tandems a year and has been for twenty years or so. Also, the tandem rating was submitted using Yuri's credentials, but was falsified by Rob, and there are reasons to suspect it was without Yuri's active knowledge or consent. Not to mention Bill was in no way involved in training or certifying anyone, it was an independent operation based on his property. And you know who verified that paperwork and issued the rating? Oh, that's right, USPA did! Who then immediately tried to use the incident to spew bullshit like ""that's why you should always make sure it's a USPA DZ and USPA-rated instructors"" conveniently overlooking the fact that EVERY SINGLE TI IN THE US jumping legally is doing that on a USPA rating, regardless of the DZ. Just like you conveniently forgot it. 

In conclusion, you're wrong and have no actual point, which you're trying to obscure in the hopes people will not know any better. Lodi is far from perfect, but that's no excuse for making bullshit up."
"I actually like the Asphalt series. Its arcade-style racing, short but varied tracks, and selection of cars makes me very fond of it.

Second place is Forza. It's still relatively fun and I love the huge selection of cars to choose from. Forza 4 will always have a place in my heart for allowing me to race a Prius against the various supercars. I'm guessing I would have adored Gran Turismo 6 which has nearly double the amount of cars, but, unfortunately, I never owned a PS3."

"Thanks for all the info! My default is caseless + skin for added grip. I’m curious to see where MagSafe accessories go. I like the idea of a MagSafe car mount and charger down the road, so whatever case decision I make, needs to be compatible with that.

And to your point...yes...incredible case options over here in iPhone-land.

Thanks for your write up!"
"Overwhelming response and thanks to you all

Dates are still unclear, but I will be going between April and August and again later on in the season towards next winter

I have sort of a plan for the first trip, going New orleans, west towards Texas, whilst visiting Baton Rogue, to Houston than to Austin and San antonio.

I think people forget how HUGE America is, especially people like me when the size of my country is smaller than a lot of states, like literally it's just massive so there is no way I'll be able to see everything

Portland, Seattle (forgot to mention seattle, but I've always been curious about visiting there) will deffo be on my 2nd visit, and fly from 1 of these cities to see Yellowstone national park (one of my bucket lists) from here I plan to go east and visit Minneapolis and Kansas city.

Money isn't an issue, it's just visa's and whatever and will have a look at this as I am pretty clueless with it all but I think I can visit for 3 months (90 days) so it should be enough time to at least do the majority of what I want to do.

the first trip (in the south) I plan to be travelling texas/new orleans etc for 1 month, and the 2nd trip hopefully 2 months (which will be the north - around winter time)
Anyway thanks for your comment guys, much appreciated and will help me a lot when it comes to properly planning this trip"
"Rats make phenomenal pets. I think of them as tiny dogs. They are not as stinky as mice (male mice stink to high heaven). They are incredibly intelligent - can learn their names and learn tricks. They are affectionate and social. But, always get them in pairs. They go psycho if kept as singletons. You can get 2, 3, or 4, but never just one."
