"I think it was my expectations honestly. I've only seen the movie twice and upon my second watch, I just remember the first time being... Better."

"The other thing that got on my last nerve was the trimming. I can usually trim with brush only. The Sherwin stuff was impossible to do with the type of brush I normally use to trim with when using Behr. I had to severely downscale in size and use a small artist’s brush to get the clean lines (because the paint was thick, like honey and just wouldn’t flow), which took much longer/more work. Oh, and four coats of the trim paint. But, now that it’s all done and the room put together, it looks nice. The color is very nice in our ‘29 bungalow bedroom with zen touches."
"Not me, sorry BUT my best friend's co-worker was on a plane when Samuel L. Jackson got on the plane. Everyone started freaking out over it and were trying to talk to him. But this guy decided he was going to play it cool and give the guy his space. The plane took off and they went where ever. As this guy was getting off the plane he was going to be passing by Mr. Jackson as he was grabbing his bag from the overhead compartment. My friend's coworker knew that he couldn't just walk by so he had to say something but his mind was blank. As he's walking by him he just blurts out, ""You are the fucking shit."" The guy just continues walking and he gets nervous because Mr. Jackson doesn't even look at him. He continues walking and is almost off the plane when Mr. Jackson yells out, ""Hey! No... You are the fucking shit."" I can't even imagine how good this guy now feels about himself."
"The first Grid was awesome, you run your own team and race all around the world with 3 categories (Europe, Asia and America). The feeling of improvement is amazing"
Don't put valuables in your checked luggage.
Wow how isn't Marshall Mathers LP not in there.
"from their videos, you can switch the strap orientation so you can switch shoulders, and it takes well under 2 minutes.  that's a feature i'd like to have."
"I love my Sony MX1000mk2s I wore them at work for 2 years, 10 hour shifts and listen on the side and they are still champs."
"She doesn't want me buying anything for her, so I'm going to a doctors appointment with her a few days after Christmas and I'm going to take her out to lunch when she's done there."
"Normally I take a Mucinex and then an hour or 2 later take a really hot shower (there has to be a lot of steam) and put your face by the stream of water and breathe in the steam. Then blow your nose while in the shower. Every time I get congested I do this and it clears me up pretty good. 
Wow this kind of sounds disgusting now that I read it..."
"I love green tea ice cream. The flavor is relatively subtle, but so pleasing."
Cinnamon ice cream is amazing.
1 tbsp - in about 875ml of ice cream
"I love Raiders but i was at the right age to see The Last Crusade in theaters and i'll never forget it for me its my all time #1. it had both Bond and Indiana,and it also had a knight and sick desert battle

*We named the dog Indiana*"
"HD (3 miles): I like Rigid corded tools and Ryobi cordless, and the garden center is setup a more to my tastes. 
Menards (6 miles): The farthest away, but it has the largest selection of wood in stock and is usually cheapest. However it’s main area is organized by Alzheimer’s inflicted hoarder so it can be hard to find shit. Also usually the cheapest. 
Lowes (2 miles): Closest to me and they also have a veterans discount which generally brings prices in line with Menards prices. 

In the end it will depend on what the project is and if I happen to have any Menards rebates on hand. Since Lowe’s is close, for oh shit trips in the middle of a project I go there almost exclusively."
"Awesome! Thank you! Yes, my TBR is growing..."
TIL everyone else on reddit has a way more interesting life than me
Russ Feingold.
I'd have to check that out.
Not trying to hate but how is it under the radar?
"I have seen Predestination, but I haven't seen Mr. Robot and I've had so many people tell me to watch it so I'll have to do that."
"PCManFM - lightweight, supports GTK themes, all I need."
"I actually liked the colours. Now, a few years later, the XR and 11 have both been offered in a variety of fun colours. I was disappointed that they don’t offer that on their top end flagship the same way Android manufacturers have been doing. I wouldn’t have minded getting a white or blue XS Max."
Couldn’t find any documentary with that tittle on Netflix? Do you know if it’s still on there or what it’s about?
