11039,best backpack for college,"TL;DR - Buy the eBags Professional Slim

My friend, have I got a recommendation for you. I've actually been wanting desperately to find someone looking for a backpack recommendation since I got it and your post just triggered me so I apologize for being overzealous.

The backpack I currently own and swear-by is the eBags Professional Slim. It runs for about $100 which is by far the most I've ever paid for a backpack but I don't regret it at all. It has a padded compartment which I use to carry my laptop. I study Computer Science so I often need to take my laptop with me places so having a dedicated pocket for it makes my life a lot easier. I take notes on my ipad so the lined tablet sleeve is also a major key for me. The quality of the material is superb and the zippers don't look like they'll ever give me trouble.

Sorry I rambled a bit there. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxw6JdUeFX4) a link to a youtube video that really goes through all the features of the bag and please feel free to ask me any real-world-use questions."
14793,best romantic novel,"Oh, I love this question! I like Clair Kingsley, Lucy Score, Melanie Moreland, Ruth Cardello, Melanie Harlow (not as great as the rest imo, but I have enjoyed some of her books), and Katie Ruggle and Pamela Clare. The last two are romantic suspense, and the remainder are  contemporary (for the most part). I'm sure there are more, I had a list on my old phone, but it didn't transfer over to the new one."

6792,best iPhone,"5S/5SE

The best looking iPhones ever (excited for the return to this design language). And just before the time where Apple seemed to build products with intentional lifespans. My 5SE is still rocking strong with no issues aside from the battery. I love this phone."

23112,best celebrity,"Robin Williams, I was deployed in the military and following his comedy USO show he came to the chow hall for dinner and sat right across from me at the table.  Super friendly, to the point that I felt sorry for him because people constantly wanted pictures and stuff.  He really got no peace at all.  But his mannerisms in person were very similar to when he is on stage."

22658,best celebrity,"I went to a BEYONCE concert and was very excited. It was a concert in Tokyo, Japan. Basically, she got upset that no one was standing up and cheering, and after like 3 songs, she wouldn't come back on stage. For like 30 minutes, the crowd just sat there and the announcer kept coming out telling us we should start chanting her name. At that point, a lot of people started leaving. Finally, after 45 minutes, she came back out in the same outfit as the first song (she had previously been changing her outfits for each song), and said ""let's try this again,"" and did the first three songs OVER AGAIN that she had already sung and then ended the concert. Afterwards, we were supposed to get to meet her but we were told she wasn't having a good night so it wasn't going to happen."

58672,best cologne,"OP, I'm very interested in your opinion since I'm staring my collection and I've some similar fragrances are you

My favorite is Spicebomb Extreme, by far. I have Dior Sauvage because I wanted a long lasting, not so expensive, freshie. I was torn between Sauvage and BdC but I went on Dior for price/performance.

Does BdC have space in the collection, when Sauvage is there? I'm not a lover of freshies in general, especially in lockdown, I find myself wearing them even less.

I've tried Eros (Edt) and I didn't like the opening, even though I just sprayed fast at the mall.

I liked the dry down better, with a good amount of sweetness and bright mint. But I'm not sure if Eros or Ultra Male, that I like because it's very dark. But Eros Edp could fix that, but I still have to try it.

I also have Black Orchid, Fucking Fabolous and I like TF Noir but it falls in the same ballpark, and I can't bring myself on spending for more TF atm"
