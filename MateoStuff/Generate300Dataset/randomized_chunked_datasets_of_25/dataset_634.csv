34996,best NFL player,"It’s a great list. Truly the best top 100 list including all eras of football I’ve ever read.

I could nitpick some things like Gale Sayers probably shouldn’t be a top 25 player (maybe not even top 50), considering where LdT is. I don’t think Elway should be above guys like Marino and Favre either.

But man, really great list."

36403,best alcoholic drink,"Red wine. Liquor takes too long to make me drunk so it's pretty easy to overdrink, whereas wine makes me feel it pretty quick."
47539,best state to visit in the United States,I Minnesota so hard I'm wearing Wild underwear....Lets just says it's Twins...Shit still weird. How about Vikings.
5447,best home improvement store,"I think it really depends on where you live and what sort of project you are doing. Where I used to live, the Lowes was great and the Home Depot was a disaster. Where I live now, it's the opposite. 

Though to be honest, I prefer my local True Value, primarily because it is closer to my house and has 99% of the things I need. I find I tend to get better and more knowledgeable service at those places, too. Little pricier, but they are locally owned and operated, so I'd rather spend my money there."

15112,best tree for the garden,"I have a customer that is wanting a very identical thing done at his house. I don’t mind explaining how I’m doing it and pricing they agreed on. We’re in the southeast though so a lot different climate than Ohio. 

1. I’m installing Thuja Green Giants. 
2. Landscaping contractor nursery is where I’m getting them from. 
3. We are planting in about 4 weeks, when our temps down here average around 50-60. 
4. He has opted for a more dense coverage “wall” so they’re going in every 6 foot. 
5. My customer is about triple the length you want but if you put them every 5-6 feet then get about 8 trees. 
6. Size and price depends on your budget. My customer has opted for a 5-6ft tree to start, so he hopefully sees 10-15ft height in 3-4 years. Buying them at 5-6ft height he is paying $90/tree and $40/tree to install, including paying the price for the rental for a mini excavator. 

These are just my numbers for this specific customer in my zone, call your local nursery to find a good tree suitable for your climate."
64732,Best Nike running shoes,"I ran exclusively in Brooks for like ten years. Then they discontinued the shoe I liked. Switched to Nike and was super happy. But it's really a matter of personal taste. I settled on the Brooks shoe after putting hundreds of miles on several different brands/models. Same with the Nike shoe. Definitely buy from a store that will let you try the shoes out on a short run, and go with what feels best."
