You have about three good friends, and none of them share this hobby (fragrance) with you, but they respect you opinion and give you shit about it at the same time."

56027,best action and adventure movie,"It's decent. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it with a hangover yesterday. It does make you suspend disbelief a lot, but if you can get past that, it's a fun flick, especially if you know a lot of the references in it."
