"Definitely not a shape I would ever use, but the gamebitions mouse has some good internal specs (Kailh switches, 3370 sensor, good battery).

I've never owned a wireless mouse bc all the shapes I like are wired... maybe someday though."

"its probably been 15 years since I read them, I should go back and see if its like new again."
"You're going to get a host of people arguing the definition of RPG now, because every game has some RPG elements these days.  Nobody can ever agree on this.  I'm not going to get too deep into that argument but if there are some prominent titles here that I am not mentioning, it's probably because I don't consider it a pure RPG in the classical sense.  

Personally I go with (In no particular order): 

**Persona 5**

**Final Fantasy XV**

**Tales of Berseria**

**Final Fantasy Type-0 HD** (A remake, but I still really enjoyed it)

**Transistor** (This really stretches my definition of RPG, as it is much more a Tactical RPG to me, but I'm using it to fill my list out to 5).


I lean much more towards the JRPG side of RPGs which is why things like Witcher aren't on my list really."
"The organic webbing was actually an idea from when James Cameron was going to direct. It was intended as a puberty metaphor. He also wanted Arnold Schwarzenegger as Doctor Octopus and his catchphrase would have been ""Okey Dokey!"" It would have been a weird movie. It was canned when Cannon films went bankrupt. You can find some of the early scripts online."
They are both good in general.
They’re both pretty equidistant to LA proper.
Get a cheap keyboard and a cheap electric guitar and learn both. This will set you up for creating/playing along with a wide range of modern music and IMO they both have qualities that help your understanding of how music works.

Well, at least he'd be pretty good at getting you into a newer model."

"Cool, didn't know about the forum. Have you all requests been answered? Also how long did it take for them to add the book you requested?"
I think there’s a valid point that if the person carries on streaming they’re quickly gonna have to replace a lot of kit... I guess the people suggesting it just underestimate the turnover rate of new streamers though

"There's a ton of them available on ebay for $10 to $20, including ""vintage"" ones.  Considering how many of them are available and how I can't find anyone selling a broken one, this sounds like a great BIFL item.  Not surprising considering how few moving parts they have, and their lack of fiddly plastic bits.  

Of course, if you really *want* to spend $500 on a fancy designer lamp, go ahead.  But a banker's lamp seems like the perfect desk lamp.  And some of them are pretty damn beautiful, too (but that could just be my inner steampunk talking)."
"Drink a lot of water, as in good 3+ litres per day. 

First day, eat only fresh fruit and veges. Avoid dairy like the plague. Go for a run/other strenuous cardio exercise. Keep going until you sweat, keep going some more until you are dripping with sweat, keep going until you are nearly dead from exhaustion, then turn around and run back home again. 

Once home, drink more water, eat more fruit and veges, have a good 15+ minute very hot shower, go to bed, sleep for 10+ hours. 

Wake up in the morning - what cold?"

"Playing on the good team rather than against it is the knock. Sure his team was European quality but the majority of the league wasn't of that quality and that's who he was playing against. To me there isn't an undisputed GOAT, it comes down to Messi, Best, Maradona and a few other guys."
