35583,"Friends of mine were feeding my wife these at the bar a few months back. I thought she was drinking regular ol' cider. She loves cider, and those taste like a cold variant of holiday cider. I should mention she's a featherweight drinker.


About the same time as she's had three of these, my buddy hands me one, and says ""try this"". I think he's goading me to chug it, so I do. He goes wide eyed as I finish it, and ask him what the hell it is, because it's delicious and it tastes like Christmas.
 

He goes: ""It's an Angry Balls"", 


To which I reply: ""What in the fuck is an Angry Balls?"" 


He informs me of the contents, prompting my response of ""you mean a boilermaker. It's a fucking evil delicious boilermaker! (panicked glance at wife) How many of those has she had!?""


She went from giggly-good-time girl to can't-function-drunk puke machine in about an hour. I got to clean puke out of the window seal of the car. And the door pockets. And the carpet. And the seat. And her hair. There would be no crazy-drunk married people sex that night.


The better part of an hour had gone by, with me de-puking our grocery getter when I rolled the window up and found out the hard way that puke had been introduced to the space between the window seals. There is no easy way to clean that.


Did I mention we'd had Hibachi that night? Rice-filled hibarfchi was hardened down the entire passenger side of the vehicle. It was damn near part of the paint. That was her first and last experience with Angry Balls, mine too, most likely. The joy of the beverage has been tainted by the crushing despair the night ended with.  




TL;DR My wife drank too many Angry Balls, and I went to bed with Angry Balls.",best alcoholic drink
60266,"I'm so thankful that my wife nagged me about getting a freezer for her breastmilk until I gave in.  We have a 10.6 cu ft GE chest freezer, and it's now about 3/4 full with frozen vegetables, chicken, and steaks.  I wouldn't go with any thing smaller than 5 cu ft because you'll probably fill it fast once you realize you have all that capacity.",best freezer brand

To elaborate a little, that touring side got that name because they didn't lose a single fixture; a feat that was quite remarkable at the time as tours back then were 20+ game affairs that would usually spring up a random loss somewhere (the Australian touring side of 1964 for instance went on an unbeaten run from April to August including four tests, only to lose a random 3 day match to Glamorgan at the start of August).",best cricket teams of all time
