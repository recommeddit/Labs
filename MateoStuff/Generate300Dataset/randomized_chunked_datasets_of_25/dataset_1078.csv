1627,best ice cream flavor,I recently had cardamom flavored ice cream and it was to die for!!
72901,best Linux distro,"FreeBSD would be my suggestion. I also like the PC-BSD spin of FreeBSD. For Linux, Debian."
48352,best color to paint with,I use a lot of the Behr Ultra Pure White as it is neither too cool or too warm and seems to go with anything. It's also a bright white so makes small rooms seem larger.
35583,best alcoholic drink,"Friends of mine were feeding my wife these at the bar a few months back. I thought she was drinking regular ol' cider. She loves cider, and those taste like a cold variant of holiday cider. I should mention she's a featherweight drinker.


About the same time as she's had three of these, my buddy hands me one, and says ""try this"". I think he's goading me to chug it, so I do. He goes wide eyed as I finish it, and ask him what the hell it is, because it's delicious and it tastes like Christmas.
 

He goes: ""It's an Angry Balls"", 


To which I reply: ""What in the fuck is an Angry Balls?"" 


He informs me of the contents, prompting my response of ""you mean a boilermaker. It's a fucking evil delicious boilermaker! (panicked glance at wife) How many of those has she had!?""


She went from giggly-good-time girl to can't-function-drunk puke machine in about an hour. I got to clean puke out of the window seal of the car. And the door pockets. And the carpet. And the seat. And her hair. There would be no crazy-drunk married people sex that night.


The better part of an hour had gone by, with me de-puking our grocery getter when I rolled the window up and found out the hard way that puke had been introduced to the space between the window seals. There is no easy way to clean that.


Did I mention we'd had Hibachi that night? Rice-filled hibarfchi was hardened down the entire passenger side of the vehicle. It was damn near part of the paint. That was her first and last experience with Angry Balls, mine too, most likely. The joy of the beverage has been tainted by the crushing despair the night ended with.  




TL;DR My wife drank too many Angry Balls, and I went to bed with Angry Balls."
60266,best freezer brand,"I'm so thankful that my wife nagged me about getting a freezer for her breastmilk until I gave in.  We have a 10.6 cu ft GE chest freezer, and it's now about 3/4 full with frozen vegetables, chicken, and steaks.  I wouldn't go with any thing smaller than 5 cu ft because you'll probably fill it fast once you realize you have all that capacity."
69660,best major to study in college,"I think education is one of the core values of Jesuits. That's why so many private schools (Dominican University of California, University of San Francisco, Boston College, Claremont McKenna for example) are Jesuit in nature, because they founded them!"
40886,best instrument to play,the motherfucking [optigan](http://www.optigan.com/images/37003.gif)
36521,best alcoholic drink,"Well, you never *plan* on going full alcoholic. But drunk you might decide it's a good idea."
57672,best cologne,Tauerville makes some unique scents that I enjoy. Particularly this one: http://tauerperfumes.com/l-air-du-desert-marocain.html
29796,best money managing app,"Agree. I’ve found that the free version is actually best because instead of linking my accounts and auto-syncing the info, I am manually inputting every single cent I spend so I feel it more. No ads. Never crashes. Can’t recommend more."
58111,best cologne,D&G The One. It’s actually the only cologne that I have consistently used for the last 10 years. My sense of smell and preference changes quite a bit and I usually get burned out on any particular cologne and have to switch it up. The One is the only cologne that I finished a bottle of and then bought another bottle. I get a lot of compliments on it.
73441,best battery bank,"I've got an 8,000mAh one from SMARTCOBY, pretty small/lightweight. Kind of hard to find good options between 5k and 10k, which is the sweet spot for me.

I think most probably do these days, but be sure to look for one with pass-through charging (so you can charge the power bank while it charges your phone)."
42338,movies like Inception,"Personally, I have never been more mind fucked in anything I have ever watched until I saw Black Mirror. Its a show though. Pretty much every episode is good, but I suggest watching episode two or three first."
25941,best cricket teams of all time,"No worries.  To elaborate a little, that touring side got that name because they didn't lose a single fixture; a feat that was quite remarkable at the time as tours back then were 20+ game affairs that would usually spring up a random loss somewhere (the Australian touring side of 1964 for instance went on an unbeaten run from April to August including four tests, only to lose a random 3 day match to Glamorgan at the start of August)."
20302,best workout music,Literally everything they do goes hard as fuck.
7936,best laptop for general use,"Is this any good?

47425,best state to visit in the United States,"This is the unpretentious version here: Go to San Francisco, Las Vegas, Washington DC, New York City and Florida. 

Skip the rest, honestly.

Dead serious. The rest of America is like small town Australia, but full of absolutely ignorant people."
5862,best programming language for web development,bad bot
45152,best items under $100,Oh I'm not one of those I still hardly get anything done when I'm medicated. I just don't space out in class as much anymore.
2601,best headphones,"Trust me I am VERY aware of that. It is very difficult to choose just one once I move to TOTLs, which I'll be doing in the next few months. This is a transistionary period. Sadly this isn't even the whole collection either. Too many odds and ends I'm in the process of eliminating. At the end I need one very good closed back for work and a stunning open back for home. So far it's looking like the HD800 may just be the next upgrade as everyone seems to call the Q701 the poor man's HD800"
43411,best ad service for mobile applications,"Yes, add it all your test devices - it is a good practice because of Google Invalid Traffic. It can help you."
62128,Best RPG game on PS4,"Your list is mostly action adventure games. As for rpgs, I picked up Divinity: Original Sin 2 on sale, just to try something different. Wound up playing 130 hours. Use the sales to experiment with stuff you wouldn't normal play. You never know."
7559,best laptop for general use,Decent (8-9 hour) battery life should be good. Weight isn't too important and my budget is $1000.
49207,best gaming monitor,It's $224 now you still loving it I need to buy one?
11031,best backpack for college,"The shirts that the backpack destroyed were from APC, cdg play, Marimekko and cos. I guess it just depends on how sweaty your back is."
