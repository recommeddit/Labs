22661,"Jennifer Lopez.  

I met that cunt at Ramstein AB, Germany during a USO tour.  Every fiber in her being is to be a cunt to everyone around her.  I interacted with her a few times over two days for a ""Salute the Patriots"" music contest/tour, and literally couldn't stand to be in the same building with her by the end of it.

She also made a friend of mine stay in tears most of the time J-Lo was there.  This friend (in base services) worked really, *really* hard to ensure the USO visit was a success (and it was), and she had to spend so much time meeting that cunt's ridiculous needs on her rider.

I was so put off by my experience with her, that I've asked my wife to never play one of her movies or her music in the house.  EVER.

TL;DR - J-Lo rustled my jimmies.",best celebrity
