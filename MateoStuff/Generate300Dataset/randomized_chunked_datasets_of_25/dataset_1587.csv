71444,best movies with a cool twist,"This ruined Interstellar's big surprise for me. 

Spoilers obviously

But when Matt Damon sits up, uncredited, never shown before, two hours into a movie?   I turned to the friend next to me and said ""put two rounds in the back of his head right now ""  because the only reason a major star goes uncredited that long is he's a bad guy."

3096,best webcamera,"Webcams are not terrible, if you use the webcam applications from Fujifilm, Canon, Sony etc. with their cameras.

All cameras with microscopic lenses and sensors are bad cameras. Especially lenses. It's just physics."
66313,best soccer team in the world,Why? You haven’t won a league in 25 years or a significant trophy in 12.
17050,best iOS game,I own it on switch too. I like every version of it tbh. The switch version is a little awkward to control at first but once it clicks it’s very smooth.

23512,best car racing video game,"Upgrading to the top of a class makes a huge difference though. A a720 vs a a800 isnt a fair fight.

That said, I hate doing a rally level in my custom tuned rally car, only to get passed by a fucking lambo with road tires on mud... They artificially make the cars the same, but it's NOT just the performance index system, they are doing something else to give them an advantage, but I'm not sure what exactly it is.

They already do plenty you can't see, like stats for anti-squat and other adjustments we can't change. Not hard to imagine they change other stuff so the races stay fair.

That said, it would be stupid if you were able to turn a Ferrari into a rally car, then faced street only supercars in mud. It would be like racing 3 classes above them."

3022,best webcamera,"They do work in a pinch, but they get hot and FOV isn't ideal. There's a reason they're not used that often"
66159,best soccer team in the world,"Very technical and extremely versatile. He could play as a midfielder, winger and striker and was more or less equally good on all positions.
He had a knack for smart runs into the opposites penaltybox as well."

288,best terminal file manager reddit,"lf + thunar

lf really gets the job done. it's simple and has default vim keybindings which is nice.

but when I need a more ""visual"" manager I use thunar. (+ for drag and dropping into a browser)"
38045,best Marvel movie,"That's a perfectly valid reason to like a movie.
I enjoyed it because it was the first marvel movie where the bad guy wasn't a mustache-twirler. I still think Killmonger was the bad guy, and he wasn't perfectly written, but it was refreshing to see someone other than ""we're hydra and we want to rule the world!"" or some of the other, more cartoony villains of phase 1 (with Ultron maybe being the worst).

Plus the soundtrack for Black Panther is legitimately amazing."
20098,best workout music,Snake holsters. It's a trade secret.
53155,best hiphop album,"Hologram - American Cheese 

(Probably the only debut album I've heard this year)"
56714,best desktop monitor,Pls edit your original post.
26107,best politician,"Well, my understanding was that both sides thought the war would be short because it would just be jockeying for position at the negotiating table, but neither side ended up accepting the other's positions. McClellan was known to be against the war (ran on a pacifist platform in the next election) so it seems less unreasonable that Lincoln took time to replace him, as McClellan was judicious with human lives. 

And regarding the reconstruction... Seeing as how we had almost no reconstruction I think Lincolns compromise would have been much better. By not giving too much too suddenly to black people perhaps we could have avoided the **extreme** violence and oppression from about 1900-1955"
28047,best breakfast foods,Cheese grits are my favorite breakfast food. It tends to be a southern thing though.
