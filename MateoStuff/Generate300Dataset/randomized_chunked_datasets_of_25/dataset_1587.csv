Spoilers obviously

But when Matt Damon sits up, uncredited, never shown before, two hours into a movie?   I turned to the friend next to me and said ""put two rounds in the back of his head right now ""  because the only reason a major star goes uncredited that long is he's a bad guy.",best movies with a cool twist

23512,"Upgrading to the top of a class makes a huge difference though. A a720 vs a a800 isnt a fair fight.

That said, I hate doing a rally level in my custom tuned rally car, only to get passed by a fucking lambo with road tires on mud... They artificially make the cars the same, but it's NOT just the performance index system, they are doing something else to give them an advantage, but I'm not sure what exactly it is.

They already do plenty you can't see, like stats for anti-squat and other adjustments we can't change. Not hard to imagine they change other stuff so the races stay fair.

That said, it would be stupid if you were able to turn a Ferrari into a rally car, then faced street only supercars in mud. It would be like racing 3 classes above them.",best car racing video game

38045,"That's a perfectly valid reason to like a movie.
I enjoyed it because it was the first marvel movie where the bad guy wasn't a mustache-twirler. I still think Killmonger was the bad guy, and he wasn't perfectly written, but it was refreshing to see someone other than ""we're hydra and we want to rule the world!"" or some of the other, more cartoony villains of phase 1 (with Ultron maybe being the worst).

Plus the soundtrack for Black Panther is legitimately amazing.",best Marvel movie

26107,"Well, my understanding was that both sides thought the war would be short because it would just be jockeying for position at the negotiating table, but neither side ended up accepting the other's positions. McClellan was known to be against the war (ran on a pacifist platform in the next election) so it seems less unreasonable that Lincoln took time to replace him, as McClellan was judicious with human lives. 

And regarding the reconstruction... Seeing as how we had almost no reconstruction I think Lincolns compromise would have been much better. By not giving too much too suddenly to black people perhaps we could have avoided the **extreme** violence and oppression from about 1900-1955",best politician
