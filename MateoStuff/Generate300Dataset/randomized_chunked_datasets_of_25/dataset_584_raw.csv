Whatever you get make sure it has a Power Delivery port. With a good watt rating.
"Almost, but Enhance isn't an ad network, or even an ad mediator. We created Enhance as a tool to speed up using SDKs in apps we were developing and helping others develop too. We are sharing it with others now in the hope it'll be useful to other developers.

We exist to create tools and services that makes developing apps and monetizing off of them easy. With Enhance you can insert SDKs into an app in a few minutes, rather than hours or even days, you can swap out which ad networks you use, or even which analytics you use."

"Basically Homecoming to me is just mostly a forgettable film.  It's not *bad*, I just find that the *only* thing I even remember about it is that Michael Keaton is great in it.  

I liked Far From Home more than I thought I was going to, so maybe I'll go back and re-watch Homecoming again sometime.  It's one of the only ones I've seen only once."
"Juice boxes were the best and I have never in my life gotten a full size candy bar
My friend though loves Halloween and she spent like $100 on candy getting a stack of those super big Hershey's bars (not the regular ones you get at a gas station but the like 2 lb ones). I helped hand them out and kids literally sprinted to their parents with it waving it cause it's too big too fit in those little plastic pumpkins they were so excited"
