57155,"The answer depends on your definition of “quality.” There’s different types of bottled water (spring water, mineral water, water from aquifers, etc), and each tends to have a slightly different taste, at least to some people. This is due to the various minerals found in these broad varieties of water. There’s also certain brands that claim their water is ultra pure, or is extra filtered, whatever. Those all more or less taste like nothing, which is probably what a lot of people want from water. 

In terms of whether it really matters which one you drink, no not really. Even the waters with the highest levels of minerals don’t really have enough to make a significant health impact. As for tap water, that very much depends on where you live. Most water treatment plants here in the U.S add fluoride to the water to help with dental health, so that’s one reason to opt for tap water here. 

Ultimately it’s up to you and how much you value minerals/purity vs. cost and potential environmental damage due to the plastics involved in large scale production.",best water brand
