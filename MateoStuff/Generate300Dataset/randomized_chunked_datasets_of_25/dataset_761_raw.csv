"I still use gray because it photographs the best and shows well on all types of screens. a couple darker or colored accent walls happen in higher end houses.

any beige, cream....anything with a brown tone can look yellow or orange on different types of screens. gray is also a good backdrop for more colorful accessories and artwork.

white is OK, but then there's no contrast interest with white trim."
I mean... if you can't use it I can come take it for you...
I bought a pair over the summer. They have them around still.
I recently bought old sprice because i heard it was good. Oh nooo

TSA can and will cut locks if they want in your pelican case. Sometimes they will even damage the bag even if they aren't supposed to open it. In the vase where you're transporting a gun for example.
They all have the same features pretty much. I use Google calendar
Icarus is a great documentary for anyone who hasnâ€™t seen it

A wonderful experimental post-contemporary hip-hop album."
The house at the end of time was a movie on Netflix. If was pretty good too
i've been a guitarist for 8 years so for me it's guitar.
Did not know that. I updated the post and will update the wiki later when not on mobile.
"> No one mentions that this is subtitles Japanese animation vs an actual movie. 

No one mentions it because it's stark fucking obvious.

""I can't do subtitles"" - is the US education system so bad that you guys can't even READ?"
"Huh, didn't even know it did that. Pretty shitty thing to happen"
Jerry Rice for sure. He's without a doubt the GOAT WR. He has all the records and championships to back everything up. You can't say that about many players with such a general consensus that they are the best at their position.
I can't use Reddit on desktop without RES anymore. It's that useful.
"I'll push my state's major cities, as I have spent time in both. Philly is great to get a historical perspective for America. Old City has both the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. Pittsburgh is a uniquely beautiful city because of its natural surroundings, and if you like hockey, the Penguins are one of the most exciting teams to watch.

"Having an online presence as an interesting person that holds cachet in the community is, of course, valuable. Otherwise it's totally irrelevant. I, myself, have a wildly inappropriate twitter that has never gotten me in any trouble."
"I would personally recommend [MX-16](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mx), which is a polished distro based on Debian stable. It's more user-friendly out of box compared to standard Debian, and comes with a bunch of handy tools that make life easier.

But if you want to really mess around with the guts of Linux, you may enjoy Arch Linux, which is installed entirely via the terminal. There are also 'easy' versions of Arch that come with a really friendly graphical installer, like Manjaro and Antergos.

Also, be sure to check out /r/FindMeADistro :)"
