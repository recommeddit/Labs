52179,best hiphop album,"again it was mostly off the top of my head, i feel you but a lot of modern music is great as well"
32614,best vacation resort,"The wife and I stayed at a Riu Palace in Aruba and loved it. We only had Wi-Fi in the lobby, but it worked out fine for us. All the rooms are mini suites and we had (included!) room service every morning.  They're very willing to accommodate you and we tested that by ignoring the room service menu and writing notes with what we wanted to eat. They always made it happen! Great experience.

Aruba is just outside of hurricane alley so you don't run the usual Caribbean risk. It's ""One Happy Island!"""
47931,best color to paint with,It’s lovely. But in 2 years beige will be the new neutral. And in 5 it will be grey again.

52547,best hiphop album,lol daily operation and step in the arena are their best tho
59588,best perfume,"You're mild mannered, on the higher strung / anxious side, and though you present outwardly calm no one would accuse you of being ""laid back."" You think a lot about quality and refinement in the things you consume, but you're not fussy and probably don't like to draw a lot of attention to yourself. You're probably easy to overlook at a party as you're not the type to take center stage, but those who have the patience to get to know you inevitably appreciate your good nature and constancy, and most of your intimate relationships with friends and partners are very long lasting."
7225,best iPhone,"Lul when i want little upgrade for my 5s to 6s
I think you should just replace your battery"
40061,best Chrome extensions,"My father is blind and could really benefit from less clutter with just read.

I installed it and it looks to be working good, but does anyone know if there's a keyboard command that would toggle it on and off?"
41007,best instrument to play,Have you ever played the drums before?
48324,best color to paint with,I'm using Sherwin Williams emerald urethane enamel in pure white for my trim and doors and will use for built in cabinets and shelves at some point. It's a neutral white that looks good with my natural wood floor and decor. I got samples of different whites and painted trim samples to see what it would look like with my lighting. It's worth the extra time
37175,best amusement park,Absolutely Disneyland/California Adventure especially based on where you are staying.
3648,best college for research,"Balseiro is the too notch university for highly speciañiced engineer, to enter you must have done at least 2 years of ingeneering education on another univercity, and then pass a hard af test, and then they interview you, the good thing is that if you are in they cover all your living expenses"
58407,best cologne,Do you know anything about Very Valentino? I love that perfume!
8782,best toothpaste,"It's way too abrasive for day to day brushing. It's like taking a steelwire brush to your car paint to clean it. Sure it will get the dirt off, but damages your paint in the process."
31708,best hotel to live in,Didn't end well for him either
54062,best medicine for a cold,"tea, and hot and sour soup."
41865,movies like Inception,Being John Malkovich
38491,best newspapers to read,"I read The Economist. I had a subscription since 7th grade, but my parents cancelled it when I went to college. I could get copies there, but now that I'm home I don't know what to do. Also the New York Times is free at my school, and again now that I'm home, my meals are lonely."
4126,best online college,Undergrad like from Phoenix? Prob same level as an associates degree.
6573,best Netflix documentary,"Into the inferno! 
Werner Herzog does such an incredible job of capturing the real magic of volcanoes around the world!"
59495,best perfume,"Hey hey, fairly accurate! Funnily enough most of my coworkers are women, haha. Computers, yes, among other stuff."
53957,best medicine for a cold,"That's great. I think they should add Astragalus and Red Marine Algae. 

In MY HOUSEHOLD we use Echinacea, Astragalus, Red Marine Algae, and Vitamin C.  When we do get sick, we kick it within a week, 2 max(the 2nd week are the lingering after effects such as cough/runny nose). We never get the flu shots, and we never go to the doctor for being sick. Just a thought for others reading this.  

Edit - I'm deathly allergic to penicillin and amoxicillin(sp?). When I was younger, the Z-paks and/or Azithromycin worked the first few times but then did NOTHING to help me. I gave up on the doctors I went to and found my own solutions."
57784,best cologne,I think you can order testers from them...
32589,best vacation resort,"Did you check out tripadvisor.com? I use them for all of my bookings to check out customer photos of the places, reviews, ratings, etc. I've never found a place that wasn't listed on there with at least a few ratings and reviews.  You can even sort accomodations/locations by ""good for couples""."
