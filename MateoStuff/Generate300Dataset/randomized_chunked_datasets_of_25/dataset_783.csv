32614,"The wife and I stayed at a Riu Palace in Aruba and loved it. We only had Wi-Fi in the lobby, but it worked out fine for us. All the rooms are mini suites and we had (included!) room service every morning.  They're very willing to accommodate you and we tested that by ignoring the room service menu and writing notes with what we wanted to eat. They always made it happen! Great experience.

Aruba is just outside of hurricane alley so you don't run the usual Caribbean risk. It's ""One Happy Island!""",best vacation resort

59588,"You're mild mannered, on the higher strung / anxious side, and though you present outwardly calm no one would accuse you of being ""laid back."" You think a lot about quality and refinement in the things you consume, but you're not fussy and probably don't like to draw a lot of attention to yourself. You're probably easy to overlook at a party as you're not the type to take center stage, but those who have the patience to get to know you inevitably appreciate your good nature and constancy, and most of your intimate relationships with friends and partners are very long lasting.",best perfume

48324,I'm using Sherwin Williams emerald urethane enamel in pure white for my trim and doors and will use for built in cabinets and shelves at some point. It's a neutral white that looks good with my natural wood floor and decor. I got samples of different whites and painted trim samples to see what it would look like with my lighting.

53957,"That's great. I think they should add Astragalus and Red Marine Algae. 

In MY HOUSEHOLD we use Echinacea, Astragalus, Red Marine Algae, and Vitamin C.  When we do get sick, we kick it within a week, 2 max(the 2nd week are the lingering after effects such as cough/runny nose). We never get the flu shots, and we never go to the doctor for being sick. Just a thought for others reading this.  

Edit - I'm deathly allergic to penicillin and amoxicillin(sp?). When I was younger, the Z-paks and/or Azithromycin worked the first few times but then did NOTHING to help me. I gave up on the doctors I went to and found my own solutions.",best medicine for a cold
