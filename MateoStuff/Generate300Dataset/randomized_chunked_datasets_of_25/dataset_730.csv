49618,best gaming monitor,"I have been burned by HDMI so often that I refuse to even try. If you can get DP, then always go with DP. 

I use iVANKY DP and DP to HDMI cables. I'm quite okay with them.

DP to Hdmi because my work laptop doc only has DP out, and monitors have only one DP in.

And gaming KVM switches are not a thing yet."

62524,Best RPG game on PS4,"The Yakuza series. Yeah, its a brawler/beat-em-up, but its also chock full of RPG mechanics like random encounters, leveling skills, equipment, and shit tons of dialogue and various activities. Easily can get 50-100 hours out of each title."
13718,best research paper archive,"Well, drawing a dividing line between the study of statistics and the application of probability is pretty nearly impossible. In practice statistics is often taken as this horrible little booklet of broken methods which are (slightly) better than nothing, but underneath that surface misinterpretation is an incredibly rich connection to statistical mechanics.

15770,best sunglasses for fashion,"I mean maybe, but if the box gets opened, it's not gonna change anything.  I think they're just MASKS FOR YOUR FACE because that's the image they're trying to portray.  Something about how they're more than (sun)glasses which can sit in the background of one's outfit, whereas these are supposed to help highlight you/your outfit/whatever.  Plus ""masks"" sounds like art pieces more than just some wearable."
