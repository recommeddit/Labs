"Hey, looking for a laptop with 16gb ram and at least 512 gb memory and preferably an amd ryzen 7 cpu (as I've read that it is more efficient on battery and speed). Additionally, battery life and a solid keyboard are important as I program and use excel quite extensively. I should mention that I don't game. I currently have an Xps 15 passed on from a sibling and aside from its battery problems and blue screening I enjoy it. However I've heard Dell QC is not the best.

I've been considering the asus zephyrus G15 (and not the G14 because the G14 is sold out everywhere and not currently sold by Costco). As for the G15, I'm a little deterred on the build quality, being prone to finger prints, and also having heard complaints about the keyboard. Just wanted to hear another opinion b/f spending almost 2k on a laptop hahah"
Sorry 600-1100 usd. (Using the stimulus check and willing to throw in an extra 500 if needed)

"i did this for a few months, it was an experience. there were some comforts such as having a room that was nicer and cleaner than my own apartment, and having nice meals cooked for me every night. but the loneliness did me in and changed my perspective of hotels. i began to see the room as not so nice after all, as it had little niggly problems that a room that no one ever *lived* in would have. i began to question its cleanliness. and having heavy restaurant meals everyday lost its novelty. in the end i hated hotels and was glad to leave that job."
"Same!

He was incredibly forward-thinking in his time. Thank him every time you visit a national park. And if you love mountain biking check out the 100 miles of trail laid out roughly between the north and south units of the park that bears his name in western ND.

I did that thing in three days with two friends of mine hauling our camping gear. On the second day around 3 p.m. we found ourselves riding next to his very own Elkhorn Ranch. The cattle in the area must have been thick when it was muddy because the trail was hellishly rough with hoof prints. We could barely keep our speed above 4mph on flat ground. It was as though Teddy's ghost was looking down on us and making us work harder just for our own good.

Bully!"
I love Pure Poison great fragrance.
Yes indeed. I've seen it on both macOS and Windows.
"For the last decade or so all I've ever bought my mom for christmas is R2D2 merchandise. She loves it, and it has it all displayed. 

But this year I'm thinking of buying her a set of pots and pans, because I used to get stoned and burn pans when I forgot I was cooking food."
"It's really a whole-package deal; Ultra-Edit is a text and hex editor that just works pretty smoothly, and can deal with anything I throw at it, from 1 kB text files to 100MB of binary garbage I have to sift through for some stupid reason. The feature creep is more an argument against wasting money on unneeded upgrades; usually, I 'upgrade' the editor whenever it gets installed on a new system, and leave it at that. Version 14 looks pretty useless (much like the Vista it seems to have been designed for); Version 13, what's installed on this machine, is snappy enough; Version 10 or 11 is also just fine.

As to regular expressions, they're very common in the Unix world (though Perl-compatible ones are not nearly as common as I would like), and *standardized*. For some bloody reason, every Windows developer likes to re-implement his own fucked-up piece of shit regular expression engine. Ultra-Edit has its own retarded syntax, but it is easily configured to use Perl-compatible REs, unlike another editor I use for writing LaTeX, WinEdt, which is stuck on its own brain-damaged REs with no option to change.

Shell extensions are one area of the Windows world that I am happily mostly ignorant of, but Ultra-Edit integrates using a custom DLL. The integration Just Works, and that's good enough for me."
"I'm the same way with the cigars.  I love cigars.  I keep a running Wish List on the Cigars International website and all of my friends and family know to visit the list if they want to buy me something.  I also keep a Wish List on an art supplies website for other friends and family that ""don't wanna help me kill"" myself.  LOL"

Working through it right now and it's a pretty good introduction to the whole process."
I can't believe people are forgetting that they are putting tons of funding into their non-ABET accredited engineering programs and their College of Doctoral Studies!

"1.	Andrew, he’s a cocky douche just like early Peter. I don’t like when he is portrayed as a goody two shoes, he’s not.
2.	Andrew, quips are on point
3.	Tobey had best fight scenes
4.	Andrew had best swinging scenes
5.	Tobey had perfect casting for most of the supporting roles
6.	Andrew is the best actor by far
7.	Andrew had best love interest by far
8.	Tobey has the best movie (SM2)
9.	Andrew had best comic recreation with the death of Gwen Stacy
10. Tobey, no question
11. Andrew

That’s 7 points for Andrew, 4 for Tobey, and 0 for Holland."
"Agreed. My dad is a builder and only goes to Home Depot, because they always have exact kind of materials he wants. I am *not* a builder, and I usually like Lowe’s because the things they sell are closer to finished products than materials."
"I recently did a ton of research on this topic for my whole-house water filtration system, so I'm glad I have a chance to share what I've learned.

My conclusion after all the reading was that RO (reverse osmosis) is usually best for wells, or situations where you're worried about things like lead, asbestos, radium, and other heavy metals. These are usually not concerns if you are on city water (unless you live in Michigan). However, RO is not very effective at filtering things like pesticides, herbicides, and chlorine/chloramines. RO is also wasteful (some systems more than others), in some cases the systems waste 2-3 gallons for each drinkable gallon produced.

Carbon filtration isn't the best at removing heavy metals and won't filter stuff like arsenic, but it is great at filtering organic compounds, pesticides, herbicides, chlorine/chloramines, etc. There's no wasted water with carbon filtration, so it's cheaper/more-environmentally-friendly.

One piece of wisdom I'll give you is **DO NOT RELY ON MANUFACTURER CLAIMS**. Look for the **""NSF Performance Data Sheet""**, and compare those. If they don't provide a NSF Performance Data Sheet I would not trust them.

Here's a performance data sheet for a [Brondell Undercounter RO ](https://www.brondell.com/media/wysiwyg/water-filters/coral-uc300-100-performance-data-sheet.pdf). Compare this to the performance data sheet of this [Aquasana Undercounter 3-Stage Carbon filter](https://cdn.aquasana.com/assets/AQ-5300+_Performance_Data.pdf).

They are both certified for NSF42, NSF53, but the Carbon Filter is also certified for NSF401 and NSFP473 (look at the data sheets above to see exactly what that covers).

For me a 3-stage carbon filter was the better choice. It wastes no water and filters out everything that would be an issue on my water supply, including lots of things that RO won't.

As for which brand you go with? Just compare Performance Data Sheets and costs of different products to find the best bang-for-your-buck. I didn't go with either of the above brands for my whole-house system (I went with a Springwell system), but if I was going to buy an under-counter system I'd probably get that Aquasana AQ-5300+."
Dissidia final fantasy opera Omnia.  It’s a gatcha roleplaying game focused on team building. If you like final fantasy it’s even better but even without it the battle mechanics are solid and the resources are plentiful overall.
