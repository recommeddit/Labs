69545,best major to study in college,The most useful degree is the one you make use of
1535,best ice cream flavor,Oh yum; I'll see if I can hunt that down.
50755,best rap album,"Sorry for the late response. But clearly not enough to contribute to a discussion like this. I definitely stick to my comfort zone, every now-and-then finding something on a shuffle or taking up someone‚Äôs recommendation.

To the point: basically I‚Äôm not hunting for music. Kinda wish I did but I can be lazy/burnt out on my commutes and that‚Äôs where I listen the most."
10966,best backpack for college,"I have an everlane bag for 3 years, but the color on the bag is fading and it is torn on the bottom. I would say the nylon commuter bag is probably better for college. I still think it's a great bag though."
3663,best college for research,"Am I the only one missing a legend? There should be some sort of readability minimum in this subtree. Otherwise it is just clunky charts.

The chart is nice but one doesn't know about the different colors"
33852,best Pokemon game,"BW2, Platinum, and HGSS all represent the peaks of the series for me."
68254,best science fiction novel,I love your selections btw
30366,best Mexican war to study,Obligatory [Simo Hayha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4)
33132,best energy drink,"No:... I used to drink 3 or 4 of them a week (along with a water when I went to the gym).. but after a while I noticed irregular heartbeats (especially under high intensity workouts or stress)... could be that was a pre-existing condition, could also be the energy drinks were making the condition worse.. so I stopped. 

I don't exercise as much anymore... but I also quit energy drinks and am trying to minimize my soda (to 1 or 2 a week)... and I feel much healthier."
41330,best instrument to play,The glass harmonica. It's basically a set of spinning wine glasses that are positioned like a piano.
7439,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I recommend you look at my [gaming laptop list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/). I would recommend the Eluktronics MAX-15 on my list, since it is fairly light but doesn't sacrifice performance. Given your budget, I would up to the RTX 3080 configuration with a Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU, which would be excellent for your uses."
16114,best sunglasses for fashion,I've bought two pairs of Ray Bans from Aooko; couldn't be happier with them. I compared them with a real pair my buddy owns and they are damn near identical. Definitely worth it.
17913,best Kardashian,"Yeah, Kylie has grown on me. It seems like for the most part she keeps her mouth shut (I can‚Äôt think of any huge scandals with her except the ‚Äúself made‚Äù thing, and she probably didn‚Äôt come up with that headline personally). I appreciate that she keeps her life fairly private given her job and the life that she has, we don‚Äôt hear much about relationship or friend drama with her and she doesn‚Äôt seem to put that stuff on blast for $$ unlike Khloe. Of course there was the Jordyn thing but Kylie was pretty quiet through it all.

She also strikes me as a good mom, I saw a video of her and Stormi cooking and when Stormi spilled something she didn‚Äôt scold her but said ‚Äúwhoops, let‚Äôs clean it up,‚Äù there were a few situations like that where she just seemed to provide good guidance and encouragement. 

Overall I respect that she hasn‚Äôt made her fortune off of drama, of course she was born rich and had a HUGE leg up in life but she built a business around something she clearly loves (makeup) and stays out of drama for the most part. She seems pretty relaxed and laid back."
28895,best breakfast foods,Avocado toast. You can throw a fried egg on top if you want too
66448,best soccer team in the world,Thanks for the explanation ‚ù§Ô∏èüáªüá™
21469,best workout music,"Saved for when I'm having a bad day and have to gym, definitely great music for soothing anger"
34053,best Pokemon game,You can play regular DS games on a 3DS
32858,best free online grammar checker,"As a computational linguist who has personally worked on a lot of the rules behind grammar checkers I can second this. Language is very tricky so a lot of the time it isn't feasible to write accurate rules for these systems. Machine learning unfortunately isn't very good at this either. What ends up happening is linguists find speech patterns that pop up repeatedly and then write rules that tell the system that the pattern is  correct/incorrect. The problem with this is that there are essentially an infinite combination of patterns that work and don't work for very subtle reasons. The other issue is that there is no giant book of what is/isn't correct. I have spent a lot of time researching certain phenomena only to find that there is no authoritative source on what is correct. Your best weapon in my opinion is to read as much as possible and picking up a style book like Strunk & White. Also, as a Korean L2-learner I would be willing to bet there are materials in your native language that point out common English mistakes for your linguistic background."

42739,best detective show,"My mistake. TRAPPED. 

You are right.  

It's nice to see all those cute Islander cheeks like my wife's on screen."
48539,best color to paint with,"Agreed, we opened the room but putting in the steel beam as the room was more divided before. I am definitely wanting to make sure it still feels like the room is whole and not make the ceilings seem smaller than they actually are!"
67717,axios alternatives reddit,"I've been stuck on 0.18.x because 0.19.0 broke our configuration. We passed custom keys into the Axios config object, mainly to do stuff like logging and tracking number of retries. 0.19.0 removes unknown keys from the object. So I had to go back to 0.18.x."
3317,best webcamera,Ive used the c270 for almost 3 years before upgrading to the c920. That little $20.00 is still a work horse. Used it as my secondary for a few moths after the upgrade before giving it to my brother to use... 730p30 is def plenty starting out on any platform but twitch especially.
