26522,I would definitely replace **Forbidden Island** with**Forbidden Dessert** of you are also planning on getting **Pandemic** as Dessert differentiates itself while Island feels too much like pandemic light. I would also put **Sushi Go Party** as the main recommendation with **7 Wonders** as the alternate. Last I would replace **Splendor** with **Dominion** as I feel it had more staying power and scratched a similar itch for me.,best board games

29807,"I've found mint more maintenance and cumbersome myself in the past. That of course may have changed. 

The new ynab android app really makes life easy with all the auto-imports, especially since we have multiple people using the app. All I do is monthly set my budget, then enter my expenses as they occur, and rest happens automatically. Now that I have monthly funding goals for most of my expense categories, budgeting takes 10 minutes tops a month after those were set up.

I still adjust on overspent categories as needed.",best money managing app

3313,"While I agree with you. I would never spend $10k on a Downhill bike, as my first buy, because I don't know if I'm going to like the sport. So I'll get a cheaper $2k bike, if I like, I buy the 10k in the future.   


I still will get a good $2k bike, not gonna be cheap and get a $800 bike. However I'll not get the high end. 

Of course, it's different when the scale is in the thousands, but it can apply to low end stuff too. the c270 is a $20 cam with really good quality, it's not a $10 webcam, or just a bad cam. So, as you're entering the hobby, it's better not to spend much if you don't have the money.",best webcamera

We've done more in Europe, United have done more domestically, and of course they have the proper treble on their side.",best soccer team in the world
