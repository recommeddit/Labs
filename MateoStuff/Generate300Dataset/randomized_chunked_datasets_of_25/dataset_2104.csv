Most people don't realize it's higher rated than Pappy Van Winkle's and is under 50 bucks.   
Awesome stuff, even a better surprise if he hasn't had it before.

64535,"Great article. I'm a huge Nike fan and primarily run in all Nike shoes. I've spent a few hours in total talking to the Nike Experts via chat when choosing my next pair of shoes and trying to compare models. When you start running in their different models, you really can tell the difference between the Lunar series, the Zoom series, and the Free's. I have Peg 33's arriving at my door today, and I'm looking forward to getting into them. I had a hard time deciding between them and the Elite 8's which on paper are extremely similar, I may pickup the Elite's just to compare them and return the one I like best. 

As someone else mentioned you missed the Zoom Streak 5's! I thought that was the elite marathon shoe of choice and not the Flyknit Lunar, but you probably know better than I. Looking to pick those up soon for my fall marathon. 

Lastly, can't say enough good things about the versatility of the Lunar Tempo 2. You can use it for temo runs, long runs, recovery runs, and they are so cheap too! Highly recommended for someone looking for a lightweight trainer and general mileage runner.",Best Nike running shoes

2398,"Sony MDR-V6. They've been the broadcasting standards for years, super tight bass. Will last forever, at least until the foam ear surrounds will distenigrate, but are available aftermarket. Best headphones you can get hand's down for < $100. Can't recommend enough. I've had cans costing 100's more (Senns, AKGs, etc). While all great headphone they all have their plus and minuses but you love the V6. Check amazon, as they are getting difficult to find elsewhere. You can thank me later ;) after you've seen them, carefully watch sporting event's, you'll notice almost everyone using them, great response, fairly flat, fit on the ear/ slightly over the ear w/40mm drivers, etc. https://www.cnet.com/products/sony-mdrv6/review/ , https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6, you get the gist.

Also, Mobile Suit Gundam: EXTREME Vs. and its sequels.  They're some of the most over-the-top fun you'll ever import.  Hell, I'd be happy just for Bamco to localize Maxi Boost at the point.",best game console

15984,"Is it worth it on a dollar by dollar basis?  Hard to say.  But if you handle a pair of Ray-Bans in store, I feel like there's a fairly obvious difference in quality between them and cheap sunglasses.  $100 or so worth?  You kind of have to judge that for yourself.

To me, it's tough because a lot of that quality difference is in the lenses, and I need prescription sunglasses, so the stock lens quality doesn't matter.",best sunglasses for fashion
