58413,best cologne,I'm pretty sure she means the natural smell of a man *after* he gets out of the shower.
58932,best perfume,For the price it's a steal. The quality is better than a lot of pricier fragrances
63482,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,[[BattSafePro]] also amazing (sadly not working for me in iPhone 11 Pro at iOS 14.0.1)
11808,best gifts for dad,"Get him a bottle of  [Evan Williams Single Barrel] (https://drinkdistiller.com/#!/spirits/evan-williams-single-barrel) 
Most people don't realize it's higher rated than Pappy Van Winkle's and is under 50 bucks.   
Awesome stuff, even a better surprise if he hasn't had it before.  


Edit:  Sorry on my original post I said Weller Single Barrel.  I totally brain farted and meant Williams.  I edited it and added a link."

47316,best state to visit in the United States,"Eh, NOLA filth is nothing a Z-pack won't clear up. Usually."
64535,Best Nike running shoes,"Great article. I'm a huge Nike fan and primarily run in all Nike shoes. I've spent a few hours in total talking to the Nike Experts via chat when choosing my next pair of shoes and trying to compare models. When you start running in their different models, you really can tell the difference between the Lunar series, the Zoom series, and the Free's. I have Peg 33's arriving at my door today, and I'm looking forward to getting into them. I had a hard time deciding between them and the Elite 8's which on paper are extremely similar, I may pickup the Elite's just to compare them and return the one I like best. 

As someone else mentioned you missed the Zoom Streak 5's! I thought that was the elite marathon shoe of choice and not the Flyknit Lunar, but you probably know better than I. Looking to pick those up soon for my fall marathon. 

Lastly, can't say enough good things about the versatility of the Lunar Tempo 2. You can use it for temo runs, long runs, recovery runs, and they are so cheap too! Highly recommended for someone looking for a lightweight trainer and general mileage runner."
32527,best vacation resort,"If you are from the US, be careful that when you drink too much alcohol you tend to ask for water. DO NOT drink those water with ice. Ask for bottled water. We made the mistake of drinking the local tab water with ice when we got drunk, and everyone who drank the local water end up either threw up or pee out of the asshole for a day or two."
2398,best headphones,"Sony MDR-V6. They've been the broadcasting standards for years, super tight bass. Will last forever, at least until the foam ear surrounds will distenigrate, but are available aftermarket. Best headphones you can get hand's down for < $100. Can't recommend enough. I've had cans costing 100's more (Senns, AKGs, etc). While all great headphone they all have their plus and minuses but you love the V6. Check amazon, as they are getting difficult to find elsewhere. You can thank me later ;) after you've seen them, carefully watch sporting event's, you'll notice almost everyone using them, great response, fairly flat, fit on the ear/ slightly over the ear w/40mm drivers, etc. https://www.cnet.com/products/sony-mdrv6/review/ , https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6, you get the gist. There's now various other variations, you can't go wrong with them."
29675,best game console,"Ninja Gaiden II; it may not have the polish of Ninja Gaiden Black (neither did the original, hence the Hurricane Packs/Black), but it's still a stupidly fun, bloody, and challenging action game.

Also, Mobile Suit Gundam: EXTREME Vs. and its sequels.  They're some of the most over-the-top fun you'll ever import.  Hell, I'd be happy just for Bamco to localize Maxi Boost at the point."
72714,best wireless lightweight mouse,Depends but I guess the best of the best have to be the RVU or GPX
15984,best sunglasses for fashion,"Is it worth it on a dollar by dollar basis?  Hard to say.  But if you handle a pair of Ray-Bans in store, I feel like there's a fairly obvious difference in quality between them and cheap sunglasses.  $100 or so worth?  You kind of have to judge that for yourself.

To me, it's tough because a lot of that quality difference is in the lenses, and I need prescription sunglasses, so the stock lens quality doesn't matter."
44491,best items under $100,"Good, high quality underwear. Not like, the 5 pack for 15 at walmart. Quality underwear from somewhere may not be majorly life changing, but the day to day improvement is amazing."
42406,movies like Inception,The Butterfly Effect
72951,best Linux distro,Arch is probably so high because the documentation is so damn good. Never ever used Arch but Iâ€™m always on that site!

1518,best ice cream flavor,I live in south Florida... it's typically too hot for lavender. I've seen some people do it but items takes a lot of work and doesn't last very long.  I always come back from Portland with a huge Ziploc of it though.
15674,best sunglasses for fashion,"I got an overpriced pair of Ray Ban opticals from a Pearle Vision like... fiveish years back, and they've been serving me well every day since then. Luxottica usually isn't a great value, but some of their brands are solid if you can get the right deal."
