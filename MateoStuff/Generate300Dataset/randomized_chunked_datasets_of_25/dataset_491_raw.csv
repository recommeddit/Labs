underrated comment. energy drinks will only do so much especially once a tolerance has formed (hint: unless you haven't had any in a week or more you have a tolerance) but water does amazing things for your alertness ..think the water in the energy drink is enough? think again
The fifth one *also* recommended it because all 5 are employed by the toothpaste company.  But it's still technically legal (and less suspicious) to say 4 out of 5 recommended it.
"Still, when you look at Romney vs. Obama, wealthy means wildly different things. 

Only successful people rum for the presidency, so they are probably in the top 1 percent."
"Gaming software EQ is terrible and not even worth using so that's a non issue. If your on pc too use the software just get APO if you want to eq your headphone.

It's also a pretty poorly tuned headphone as well.

The flight s has a much better stock tuning but still meh.

99% of 7.1 vss is garbage so that's a non issue"
"You know that nudes of Merkel exist, right?"
Yup. I wanted a long (10’) lightning cable  to fit my work setup and don’t regret getting the cable from Anker. It was a fair price for a surprisingly heavy duty cable that’s worked great.
"Ritz Carlton has the nicest hotels, but there is no free anniversary night. The Ritz card is good for getting gold status though both at the Ritz and Marriott chains"
The Prestige will be one you enjoy.
"If you're a journalism major, getting involved in student publications/media is way more important than classes. Journalists aren't hired based off of their degree, but how well acclimated they are to newsrooms, deadlines, etc. You can't learn the trade in the classroom, only in the field. Classes are to just help you refine your skills and the little things

EDIT: I didn't mean to imply that classes are useless. The degree itself pretty much is, but most of my professors are accomplished/active journalists so they have so much to teach students that really is invaluable. The classes do matter to help you in the field."

Melted marshmallow maybe? I've seen them but I've never eaten one.
"That gonna take a long time to do on phone . My laptop is not working.

Don't forget his others- this week is micro and parasitology!
"Fate Series, Death Note, Attack On Titan, Steins;Gate"
"u/CrazyCatLadysCat, THANK YOU! I bought The Hating Game yesterday and chewed through it in like 4 bingey hours. Awesome read. Thank you! Any other great suggestions?"
Yes he has great intensity
You could stick that bacon in the oven and it will be tastier.
"Whenever I see Starship Troopers, I immediately recommend Armor as a follow-up book. They're a great way to get two different looks at war.

Then I throw Old Man's War at them, because Scalzi's writing is literary candy."
"Fuck it. Name names. Punch some people in the mouth.

… unless you mean me because that Fred Warner ranking is an oops in hindsight sorry 9ers fans."
"Lime margarita on the rocks, lots of salt.
Or a good hefeweizen.
Or cabernet."
"First of all, they're C cups, and it makes me feel awkward."
Top kek..  Seriously though this list is some jive shit
"Thank you for this wonderful resource!

I think there's a correction to be made. The table says Unreal mobile offers international data roaming as an add-on, but [according to their website](https://help.unrealmobile.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042875731-Does-UNREAL-Mobile-allow-roaming-) this is not true. Could we get this updated?"
Sushiya has discount days for california rolls. Super good value.
"Wellllll, I recommend Kristen Ashley A LOT. It’s annoying. I annoy myself. In my defense, she’s written a ton of books and I’ve read almost all of them in the last year, so they’re fresh in my mind. There’s almost always at least one of her books that fits a requested trope. MC? Check. Alpha? Check. Second-chance? Check. Law enforcement? Check. Athlete? Check. Musician? Check. Shy heroine? Check. Sassy heroine? Check. 

Lately, I have been holding back recommending her as much. Even if it doesn’t seem like it! Bwa.

ETA: I have never read Alexis Hall or Klune. What titles would you recommend? Clearly I need to expand my horizons."
