36881,Apocalypse is a solid wood coaster and probably the only thing you're missing out on. Green Lantern sucks and there is a much better 4D coaster that is open and Viper is your typical Arrow looper. It's fun but a bit rough. It's also supposed to be open again soon so maybe you'll get it.,best roller coaster at six flags

26637,"I own it. It didn't jive that well for me due to the nature of that instant loss (also limited time). The amount of guesses can also feel pretty slim. I don't think I gave the game a fair shake and will give the game another try down the line. It's not a game I think people should own immediately, unless they really like word games with a co-op twist.",best board games

33810,"My favourite is BW2, has a wide amount of Pokémon available for use and is fun enough to replay constantly, plus the level curve is designed well enough that you're not notably underleveled at any point and that the challenge comes from the trainers themselves, and not the level gap, and I'd have Emerald and SWSH just behind it on my list.

My least favourite is HGSS (I'll use the remakes as I haven't touched the originals in a long time) due to most of the game being boring, due to a mix of low level Pokémon that end up being the same, mon choice that's more of a pain than anything (half the options are Pokémon I would not want to use) and the level curve being absolutely garbage for pretty much the whole game (overleveled until Clair, and underleveled afterwards with no good places to grind) that the last time I tried playing, I had to stop after Lance.",best Pokemon game

2575,"Aye! Though what bugs me about the Focals is that they are closer to a portable headphone design in size than a full-size headphone design. They have quite heavy cables though, suggesting they really are intended as desktop headphones ostensibly for audio monitoring. I haven't worn them for any long period of time though - are they comfortable for long periods compared to other full sized closed backs? (DT770, 1540, Z7, etc.)",best headphones
