36881,best roller coaster at six flags,Apocalypse is a solid wood coaster and probably the only thing you're missing out on. Green Lantern sucks and there is a much better 4D coaster that is open and Viper is your typical Arrow looper. It's fun but a bit rough. It's also supposed to be open again soon so maybe you'll get it.
59974,best perfume,"Aqualina Pink Sugar is good for the price, however,worth noting that for a few dollars more you can easily get Reb'l Fleur, Fantasy or Purr, which are somewhat in similar ballpark but all smell of higher quality."
26637,best board games,"I own it. It didn't jive that well for me due to the nature of that instant loss (also limited time). The amount of guesses can also feel pretty slim. I don't think I gave the game a fair shake and will give the game another try down the line. It's not a game I think people should own immediately, unless they really like word games with a co-op twist."

39389,best web browser,Don't know what's best but I use Firefox the most and feel safe and comfortable with it. I also enjoy Yandex browser. Recently tried Chromium Edge and I'm really impressed! It could probably be my second favorite browser.
42559,best detective show,"If you have access to HBO max, I would recommend this too. I can't wait for season 2."
52,best terminal file manager reddit,"Ranger, mc, vifm, etc work better when you need to move lots of random files to one directory. Select, then move."

22900,best celebrity,"Why do people seem to hate Morgan Webb? I only watched X Play in the very beginning, i get the feeling that something happened in the later seasons?"
36608,best alcoholic drink,It was a neat glass of rum. Now it just might be Jägermeister.
33810,best Pokemon game,"My favourite is BW2, has a wide amount of Pokémon available for use and is fun enough to replay constantly, plus the level curve is designed well enough that you're not notably underleveled at any point and that the challenge comes from the trainers themselves, and not the level gap, and I'd have Emerald and SWSH just behind it on my list.

My least favourite is HGSS (I'll use the remakes as I haven't touched the originals in a long time) due to most of the game being boring, due to a mix of low level Pokémon that end up being the same, mon choice that's more of a pain than anything (half the options are Pokémon I would not want to use) and the level curve being absolutely garbage for pretty much the whole game (overleveled until Clair, and underleveled afterwards with no good places to grind) that the last time I tried playing, I had to stop after Lance."
4896,best home improvement store,I use Lowe’s over Home Depot because of the app for the military discount. HD offers it revert day here too but you have to prove it every time. Lowe’s just scans my phone and boom!  Discount.
70902,best movies with a cool twist,It looks intriguing! Thanks for the recommendation
15479,best tree for the garden,Check out the Cincinnati Zoos website.  It’s a great botanical garden with lots of insight on plants that thrive in your area.  There you can find brochures on the zoos best large medium and small trees shrubs perennials annuals and grasses.
2575,best headphones,"Aye! Though what bugs me about the Focals is that they are closer to a portable headphone design in size than a full-size headphone design. They have quite heavy cables though, suggesting they really are intended as desktop headphones ostensibly for audio monitoring. I haven't worn them for any long period of time though - are they comfortable for long periods compared to other full sized closed backs? (DT770, 1540, Z7, etc.)"
5932,best programming language for web development,God I am struggling so hard with their JavaScript lessons.
