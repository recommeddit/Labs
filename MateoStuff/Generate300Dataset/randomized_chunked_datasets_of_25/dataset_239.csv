61564,Best RPG game on PS4,"From wikipedia: ""Bloodborne[a] is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4."""
45756,best trick or treating candy,"I went to Walmart. Found a bag with twizzlers (ew), kit kats, reeses... and mother fucking jolly rancher lollipops. Those were my favorite suckers as a kid and someone on /r/nostalgia recently posted about them so of course I shed a million tears because I thought I'd never get to see them again.. but sure enough! Granted, they are smaller but still. That bag claims 215 pieces so I got one and a bag of 400 tootsie roll midgies. So if no/few kids come I'm going to be happy! I spent a million hours in the Halloween candy aisle overthinking my options. Plus I grabbed a bag of candy corn for my boyfriend, though I practically had to dig for those at target. Walmart only had pumpkin spice candy corn which sounds disgusting, and probably is if they're anything like the pumpkin spice Oreos."
35864,best alcoholic drink,Jäger bombs quickly followed by additional Jäger bombs.
56074,best action and adventure movie,"Ahh, Good ole' TItan A,E,"
56656,best desktop monitor,"I might have missed it, but I would add something for primarily esport title players to prioritize refresh rate/input lag over resolution. If you have a 1060+ and only play league of legends a 1080p120 isn't a waste like it might be if you're primarily playing AAA titles"
26620,best board games,You can buy it directly from Elephant Laboratories. I did the other day and am (im)patiently waiting for it.
3660,best college for research,"As an American, I too am happy to see mine on the map. :D"
62726,Best Data Science textbook,"You could, but it would be a really bad idea.  Blindly applying models you don’t understand makes it really easy to fit a model that looks good on paper, but fails terribly when applied to the real world.  Or you’ll end up testing 100 different models without knowing which ones work well for which types of problems.

I’d highly recommend going through Introduction to Statistical Learning first.  Make sure you understand the techniques in it before you move on.  Once you’ve done a bunch of the exercises and feel comfortable explaining what the techniques do to other people, move on to Applied Predictive Modeling."
41374,best instrument to play,Vuvuzela.
43317,best ad service for mobile applications,What's wrong with admob?
36528,best alcoholic drink,Raw egg? Wtf for? Does it just help everything adhere?
13656,best research paper archive,"I've seen people use patreon to fund research before. It's not the most effective method, but even a long shot is a shot."
33089,best energy drink,"Rip it. Cheap, the orange flavor is pretty good, and the lime flavor tastes exactly like a margarita."
65322,best phone service company,its wrong. please update
5408,best home improvement store,Commenting to save. Really useful information here!
17912,best Kardashian,Probably Kylie. The older sisters are are getting on my nerves lol.
41646,movies like Inception,"Source Code is very similar

Bit of a stretch but Solaris (1972) is way different in tone but deals with a person's mind effecting the world around them"
58046,best cologne,"Montblanc legend, YSL L’Homme, Montblanc explorer, and Francis Kurkdjian Paris are my top 4 fav colognes. For clubs and stuff I’d say Versace Eros and Acqua di Gio.

If you want to learn more about fragrances. Check out the /r/Fragrance sub or even /r/fragsplits"
7096,best iPhone,"You could live without it, you just choose not to."
18105,best Kardashian,"I remember there was a video of kylie at an appearance and she took a fans phone did a 180 selfie and didn’t hand the phone back just dropped it on the ground

ETA: I can’t find the video on YouTube or anything about it on google. I remember it was like right when her and tyga started dating"
13240,best gifts for mom,"I would suggest a camera. A nice one. SO said that he wanted to get me one as a ""push present"" but I know its not in the budget right now. I will, however, be waiting patiently for this camera. The one I have is pretty decent, but the pictures I could take with an even nicer one: so appealing. Or, if she already has a camera, maybe a photo printer? I have one that I absolutely love, but it only came with enough ink and paper to print five pictures, so take that into account should you go that route."
23524,best car racing video game,Man I remember the old Gran Turismo games and doing a race a bunch of times to buy new cars.
29556,best game console,"I really considered adding it to the list, but I'm really on the border due to reviews >.<"
