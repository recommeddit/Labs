"In this day and age, I would absolutely recommend learning JavaScript if your goal is to become a web developer. More and more the browser is becoming sort of like a thin-client for cloud services, and JS is the language that browsers understand. Currently, there is also a huge surge in popularity of building native (and native-like mobile websites) with React Native (a popular JS library), and the technology in that space is just getting better.

If you're thinking about doing mostly backend web development, you could get away with minimal html/css/js knowledge but if you're wanting to build any sort of modern web app, you'll need JavaScript."

"I'd recommend Xubuntu, it's Ubuntu but with a more Windows-like interface."
The Devil Next Door!!! It‚Äôs about a man who was deported from the us and put on trial in Israel for being a nazi soldier in a concentration camp.
"The Guardian, they seem to me to be the only news outlet of the ones i have read which don't make crap up as they go along to bend toward their political ideals.

Seems like i will have to check out the 'i' and Private Eye :)"
"Undergrad senior majoring in studio art, I don‚Äôt want to go to art school but I‚Äôm extremely happy with my choice of majors. Any job that I truly want, I can honestly get with the degree I have. Sure, I can‚Äôt get a computer science job, but I don‚Äôt want it.

"what did you do in this time? I'm trying to go back to school after 1.5-2 yrs and a very wasteful period (reclusive, depressed, turned to gaming all day for most of 2020). I decided today to go back but it might be too late for applications for semester 1 (I'm in Australia, school starts this month). And I dread the thought of 5 more months of doing nothing"
"When I was about 15 I found out that when Christmas came around, my mom was the one that bought every single present under the tree. The presents from Santa (I knew that previously, but eh). The presents from my dad to her (later step-dads). Ones from grandparents to us. Basically everything, with the exception of when I bought her Christmas presents. So she always cherished my presents because it was something she didn't buy herself."
