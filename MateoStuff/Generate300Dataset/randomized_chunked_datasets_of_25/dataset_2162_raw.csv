"A microfiber comforter. Microfiber is the softest damn fabric in the universe, literally feels like someone managed to weave Goldbond powder into a solid sheet.

Get a comforter made out of it and you will ALWAYS sleep naked, and it will always feel great."
"If I'm gonna pay for bottled water I want it to be at least semi-interesting... I think my favorite is **Apollinaris**, the so-called ""Queen of Table Waters"" that has been bottled in Germany since 1852. It's lightly carbonated, has 25% of your daily recommended magnesium intake, and is very very slightly salty. Also the preferred water of Patrick Bateman, how's that for snob appeal?"
"Santa Barbara Woodfire Catering out in Goleta at Captain Fatty's Brewery. Their Margarita is super good.

Olio's Pizzeria is good. The Umbra is wonderful.

And Gino's on Figueroa is classic."

This is fantastic. I've been waiting for the real post to upvote it properly.
It's still pretty aracdey compared to the more serious sim racing games (with a good amount of assists to tweak to your liking). But it has one of the best and most fleshed out campaign modes out of all the racing games.
"Nothing wrong with one meal a day: https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/
What you eat/drink for that meal or otherwise is probably more resultant on this belly of yours."
"It's like someone couldn't pronounce Acetate, the material used to make the frames."
"I actually never noticed! Damn that's a goal.  


I always went to Anker products because I felt they were very high quality. Seeing them on the Apple Store solidifies my perception."
"I just opened my copy of *Battle Cry of Freedom* and can verify that there is no coverage of Chapultapec. While he lightly touches on the strategy of the Mexican War, there is no discussion of the battles of that war, except insofar as they relate to the Civil War, whether it be in regard to participants, tactics, strategy, etc. Although a fantastic book, it's probably not a great for OP's purposes."

I've always had a hard time believing there's only ten dentists.
"How do you like elder scrolls blades? I got it when it came out, but felt the combat was a little awkward. (More awkward than the elder scrolls usually is)"
One minor note: is it possible to provide the width of the preview pane to the previewer script?
"Why is that?

EDIT: Why would you downvote me for asking a question? I'm trying to learn something here."
Found the guy who's never been.
