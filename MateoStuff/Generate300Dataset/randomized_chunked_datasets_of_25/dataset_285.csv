10259,"Rotring 600, in 0.7 mm. By far the best mechanical pencil that I have even experienced. Hands down.

For about 20 years I've used 0.5 mm mechanical pencils such as Pentel, and I was satisfied with them.  But switching over to Rotring was unbelievable.  It really surprised me how easy it was to write with it.  It seems weird to say that -- I mean, it is just a mechanical pencil, so I was surprised how surprised I was, as well.  

I am not sure why I strongly prefer Rotring over the various other mechanical pencils that I've used in the past.  Maybe it is the feel of the solid construction.  Maybe it is the metal cut grip.  Maybe it is that it has very little play.  Maybe it is its high weight.  

I switched from 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm and from HB (No. 2) to B (No.1) lead, and that may have also made a big difference.  

Any downsides? Well, it does not have a retractable point like many of the high-end mechanical pencils, so you cannot put in your pocket.  It needs to remains on your desk or in some carrying case.  If you want the retractable point, you'd have to get the Rotring 800.",best pencil for drawing
