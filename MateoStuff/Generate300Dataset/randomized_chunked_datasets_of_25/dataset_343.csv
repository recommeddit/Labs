43486,best items under $100,No matter the knife my wife would always just use pressure to cut things. She was amazed how I was able to cut tomatoes and bread without destroying them. “Let the knife do the cutting”
6712,best iPhone,"The debate following the OP on which one of the most famously throwaway-culture supporting, obsolescence-planning, overpriced, non-user serviceable company's phones is the most BIFL one -- is the wrong one to be having. 

Get an LG V20.  Mine is 5yo, has 128gb in expandable storage via a microsd slot, and a third party 10500mah battery. It suffers from zero issues, and any part that breaks I can either buy and replace myself or send it to my repair guy who does this stuff for a living. It's sitting beside my x230, twice that age, same thing.  No one ""needs"" a Mac or an iPhone.  The world would be better off without them."

73384,best battery bank,I just bought my 10K PowerCore Lite and found out about this... now eagerly waiting for resupply at my local Anker outlet. This is actually optimal for on-the-go day charges and saves some space in the bag. If this is sufficient to power my Pokemon GO obsession while traveling then I’ll reconsider my CARD Traveler + Anker 10K setup.

51077,best rap album,"I mean, I like the ""AM"" album.  But for NME to throw out that Alex Turner is a genius, comparing him to John Lennon, and all the other claims gets a little ridiculous after a while.  I find it hard to believe that the author took the time to take Alex Turner's dick out of his mouth and actually sat down and wrote this review."
1578,best ice cream flavor,"Chili lime.  I used to work at a place that a did a trio of ice cream with that one, dark chocolate, and strawberry peach.  It was awesome."

31952,best hotel to live in,"> Its my understanding that you can transfer them 1:1 to a lot of airlines (although I haven't), and they also have some good promos.

I believe you can transfer them 4:5 to Delta (4 starwood points = 5 delta points)"

59318,best perfume,I wear this too! People compliment on it too and honestly it surprised me at first on how well it smelled because I didn’t expect to smell so nice
45445,best gaming system,"I'm a pc gamer and didn't touch my pc for like 2 months after getting my switch and you can always buy other controlers so you don't break your joycons. I have a 8bitdo sn30 pro cabled (30 canadian bucks) as my main controller and I use the Hori charging station or I use a male usb-c to female usb-a adaptor ( cost me 4 bucks ) to enjoy all my games.

The only time I ever use the joycons it's when I need the motion control aspect, like for botw when you get the motion control shrines."
3315,best webcamera,"Yeah, if you have the money why not. Also for streaming, if you start to make money from it, then you can use the money from the stream to buy good equipment."
55004,best places to hike in the east coast,"The whole east coast is a mountain range (hence the Appalachian Trail running from Georgia to Maine) so it depends what type of hiking, preferred climate zone, time of year, difficulty level, etc. Throw a dart at the Appalachian trail and find the nearest town. 

I am partial to White Oak Canyon Trail in Shenandoah National Park (a spur off the AT) and Old Rag Mountain Loop. However, they can both be busy in peak summer season. 

I thought the hike to Preachers Rock in Georgia was also well worth it for a day hike. Its fun to meet AT through hikers on the first leg of their journey."

11529,best gifts for dad,"As a child my sister and i started buying him walking sticks every year for Father's day. Don't know why. I think maybe he wanted one, and we just kept buying them, every Father's day for about 32 years (I was 4 when we started doing it). Even in to adulthood my sister and I would confer on what one to buy and go in half and half for it, even though we had to order online. After she died, I kept it going. The first one was just a classic Shillelagh that our dog gnarled the end of, but there were ones with knifes hidden in them, flasks, sundials, compasses, and just ones that were pretty. He kept all of them, even had a custom stand built for them. After he died his girlfriend told me that when they would go for walks, as they did frequently, he would always pick one, and if ever they went on trips he had to have one with him just in case they might go for a walk.

They are mine now, and I think my wife intends on introducing the tradition to my newborn daughter when she is old enough..."
