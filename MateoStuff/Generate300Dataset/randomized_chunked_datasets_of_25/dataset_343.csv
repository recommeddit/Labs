6712,"The debate following the OP on which one of the most famously throwaway-culture supporting, obsolescence-planning, overpriced, non-user serviceable company's phones is the most BIFL one -- is the wrong one to be having. 

Get an LG V20.  Mine is 5yo, has 128gb in expandable storage via a microsd slot, and a third party 10500mah battery. It suffers from zero issues, and any part that breaks I can either buy and replace myself or send it to my repair guy who does this stuff for a living. It's sitting beside my x230, twice that age, same thing.  No one ""needs"" a Mac or an iPhone.  The world would be better off without them.",best iPhone

55004,"The whole east coast is a mountain range (hence the Appalachian Trail running from Georgia to Maine) so it depends what type of hiking, preferred climate zone, time of year, difficulty level, etc. Throw a dart at the Appalachian trail and find the nearest town. 

I am partial to White Oak Canyon Trail in Shenandoah National Park (a spur off the AT) and Old Rag Mountain Loop. However, they can both be busy in peak summer season. 

I thought the hike to Preachers Rock in Georgia was also well worth it for a day hike. Its fun to meet AT through hikers on the first leg of their journey.",best places to hike in the east coast

11529,"As a child my sister and i started buying him walking sticks every year for Father's day. Don't know why. I think maybe he wanted one, and we just kept buying them, every Father's day for about 32 years (I was 4 when we started doing it). Even in to adulthood my sister and I would confer on what one to buy and go in half and half for it, even though we had to order online. After she died, I kept it going. The first one was just a classic Shillelagh that our dog gnarled the end of, but there were ones with knifes hidden in them, flasks, sundials, compasses, and just ones that were pretty. He kept all of them, even had a custom stand built for them. After he died his girlfriend told me that when they would go for walks, as they did frequently, he would always pick one, and if ever they went on trips he had to have one with him just in case they might go for a walk.

They are mine now, and I think my wife intends on introducing the tradition to my newborn daughter when she is old enough...",best gifts for dad
