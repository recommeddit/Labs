Is there any chance of it becoming cheaper again, on Amazon or anywhere else, in the next 6 months? And any place I can monitor to check its price across websites?

23200,"Understood. I didn't want to use a freelancer because I want to keep the budget as low as possible and in turn it will help me gain the most knowledge also.

However, I now understand that it won't be easy for me to deliver this service in time. Maybe I will present a few key features of the website as proof of concept at the conference and take my time to develop the website in its entirety, maybe until the end of this year?

In regards to the other bit of your advice, you are suggesting I use JavaScript for both front end and back end development, right? And that MEAN stack is the way to go about it?

What do you think about u/aramboyajyan's advice that I use Django because I know a bit of Python already? Do you have any experience with that?

The story has multiple threads, all connecting at most surprising points. Magic is there, and in not seen anywhere else form. Characters are vivid, and even if they live short and die ugly, there's a meaning to that. I think this has the most potential to call it epic.

&#x200B;

I would argue that reading and implementing the lessons in *any* of the other books in that top 10 would give you a massive boost in productivity - especially when you extend the definition of productivity from independence (getting my own stuff done) to interdependence (working with other people to get stuff done).

5470,"Well, like I said in another comment, it seems to be staffed almost entirely by idiots. I hardly ever go there, and yet I've had more problems with product being out of stock at that store, when the website said it was in stock, than at all the other metro-Indy Menards stores *combined*. Product is frequently not where it belongs on the shelves. Employees don't know where things are.  On-line orders that supposedly were picked and wrapped, ready to be picked up, are nowhere to be found.

Yes, the store opened only a few years ago, but that shortly followed the closing of their previous east-side store at Pendleton Pike and Shadeland -- which *also* was a dud, for the same reasons I cited above, and in addition was small, dirty, poorly lit, and poorly maintained. I suspect that much of the staff, and all of the management, are holdovers.",best home improvement store

Sileo has a huge backing by a very senior and arguably more talented devs, including Kirb, CoolStar, Andy Wiik, and AppleBetas.

Also to leave out the founder and the creator of most of the huge parts of Zebra, Wilson. Shame on you....

This makes me not like this post more.

27310,"I only have 4 names to share since I own only 5 stocks and one isn't a long-term hold. In order of conviction:

1. ROKU: More households cutting the cable cord should continue to support active accounts, especially internationally + advertising $$$ shifting from linear to streaming. I have a $420 - $500 price target


2. IDXX: Don't confuse this with IDX being pumped from Wall Street Bets. This is a better stock that does diagnostics for pets. Continued innovation in animal Healthcare + more people owning pets + people caring more for their pets = more tests for pets. $745 price target


3. ZTS: Another solid animal health stock, #1 in animal pharmaceuticals. Although it's my #1 best-performing stock, lower on the list because it's more mature at almost a $100b market cap.


4. TTWO: Best-in-breed video game developer best positioned to benefit from Xbox Series X/PS5 console cycle due to higher mix of console revenue + the metaverse since they have proven open-world intellectual property like GTA and Red Dead Redemption. My price target is only $175, but it can go higher depending on news about the pipeline and personally believe this is my #1 upside stock, but with higher risk.",best stocks to buy
