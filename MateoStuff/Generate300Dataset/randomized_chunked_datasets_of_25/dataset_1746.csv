6865,best iPhone,i’ve got an iPhone 11 and a 11 Pro Max. love them both
6705,best iPhone,"I moved to an SE 2020 after my original SE was getting too unusable. I like it and it’s perfectly fine for everything I need. Battery life isn’t all that bad for me honestly. It seemed huge at first but still much smaller than the other iPhones at the time. Really hard to beat for the price and barley shows signs of wear in the year or so I’ve had it. 
If I were looking now I’d seriously look at the 12 mini though. Better screen and form factor and will be more future proof than the SE 2020 so should last even longer."
57792,best cologne,These look really unique! Might have to check them out.
27252,best stocks to buy,"Disney definitely fits the bill, upstart another one. Palantir and snowflake maybe a little more speculative.

You still can’t deny the ones that have already run. Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon all have huge valuations but I’d still expect them to be in the biggest companies in the world 10 years from now.

Another I like on the long long hold is NVIDIA.

Full disclosure I own all these stocks but I’m not trying to pump it’s an honest opinion."
