66841,best soccer team in the world,"Yeah but tbf the Russian league makes things weird about the Russian NT. Their player just don't ever go abroad since they have their own version of the English tax where they must have some number of Russians in a team. Every good Russian just stays at one of the bigger teams cause they're on massive wages there. 

Think about it: your average Croat/Serb has a very solid progression in his career playing for all kinds of teams and developing along the way. The Russian hits a Zenit or CSKA Moscow and that's the end of that. Why would they go to a Borrusia or a West Ham when they make as much money playing easier football?"

8941,best toothpaste,"You can not ever get your lost enamel back. The dentin (yellow inner layer of your tooth) can be redeposited, but once the enamel is gone, it's gone. If your teeth are abraded, I recommend asking your dentist for a fluoride varnish to protect or remineralize the remaining enamel. Also, fluoride varnish seals your dentinal tubules which reach into your pulp (nerve portion of your tooth) and cause sensitivity. Here is an illustration of a [tooth](http://www.intelligentdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/P1.gif) structure to help you understand."
