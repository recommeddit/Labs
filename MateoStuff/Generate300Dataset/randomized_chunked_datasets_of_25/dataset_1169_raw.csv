"I was about to mention National Treasure only to look it up and see that it came out fifteen years ago. Dang man, how did I get so old"
The one on the dollar bill
"This exactly. I have 3 boards, one with Blacks, one Reds and one with Nature Whites. I use the Reds at home to game, but the nature whites at work where I actually do the most typing. They're perfect."
So he couldn't get Jeff Goldblum to do the computer work for him?
Nutella.  Not a dentist.
"Nothing at all, even on older ""pre-fix"" 1008 firmware (using vega64)"
Personal capital is amazing
"Try FF7 Remake, it’s active combat vs turn based like most FFs, and is overall great graphics, vibe, and story wise. I think you can play the first chapter as a demo"
I didn't mention Iraq II. The above isn't an exhaustive list.
*The West* is a documentary series by Stephen Ives. Ken Burns lent his name to the project as executive producer in order to give his friend's work heightened visibility.
I can see someone being way more confident at 18. Especially if they are dating someone as hot as Gwen ect and had their powers for awhile and such. I think both did a great job honestly but the stories they had were totally different as well.
Time alone.
Nobody seems to be mentioning Scotland Yard so I’ll just add it in here quick. :)
"Thank you for the nice list. I watched The uninvited and it became one of my favourites. I somehow expected Anna to be the killer but when I FOUND OUT ALEX WAS DEAD THE WHOLE TIME, THE WHOLE TIME. Oh damn I fucking threw my headphones away. Oldboy also became one of my favourites. Probably in TOP5. It was disturbing and the fact that we weren't watching the main character's revenge story the whole time. Oh fuck. And for last but not least, I think No way out is way overrated. I found it boring and I also found the twist making no sense at all. And thank you once again buddy, two of your recommendation became my favourite."
"**[Barbareno](http://barbareno.com/)** for something classy (but not overpriced). **El Zarape** for authentic Mexican food (I don't get the fascination with Los Agaves--if you're in the mood for less authentic, **[Los Arroyos](http://losarroyos.net/)** is MUCH better). And [The Blue Owl](http://blueowlsb.com/) is the food I crave when I'm away from SB, fusion food like nowhere else with lots of local ingredients."
The one that comes with the pixelbook laptop is pretty long - I havent actually checked if it fast charges a pixel phone though but.. I assume so?
wut?
"I typically but them from Apple, since you know that there absolutely won't be any problems with them"
"What's ""good"" to you? A lot of pianists never feel they are ever good enough by their own standards, which can be a good thing because it is a driving force to getting better and better. 

What's your short term goal?"
"Agh. I always try 'where the kitty kitty?' Because once in a while she'll go looking for him and I can pretend I'm alone for forty seconds. But usually she just stands there, stacking Mickey and Minnie books in my lap and poking my upper thigh and saying 'butt.'"
"The Dutch have definitely been more consistent, but they’re widely regarded as being ‘the best team to never win a world cup’ and it feels like they had two generations with a great shot and just couldn’t get it either time"
Maybe we should start one /r/biology. That would be pretty cool.
"my mechanics. 

It’s a dude restoring old rusty items to perfect condition without any talking!  There are other channels like that, which are just as good, but he has to most subscribers. Very relaxing to watch before bed."
"So I have a very old very top of the line 10 years ago gaming PC, and I'm usually fine with fps stutters between 25-60. I can play most modern games pretty okay. But I always play with anti aliasing. Now your post makes it seem like Anti  aliasing isn't actually that neccessary to make the game look prettier? Or is that specific to ultrawide 4k gaming, because you can't see the pixel anyways so you don't have to smooth them?



The card is a Radeon HD6950 btw, funfact it was the best card to mine bit coins when they were like a few cents a piece. I mined half and turned it off because I was afraid this card would die on me early. Still running like a beast to this day."
"These are good recommendations. I'd also add Milk and Honey for tapas and drinks. Los Agaves is the best Mexican food anywhere, full stop. I live in San Francisco now and dream of their menu constantly."
