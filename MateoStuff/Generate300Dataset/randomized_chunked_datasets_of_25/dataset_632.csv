41158,"Becoming proficient at any instrument without having ever practiced in your youth is probably not going to work out so great.  Not to be mean, but chances are you won't get past a basic level unless you can make up for all that lost practice time.  A computer is as much an instrument as the guitar someone has played since middle school, get Live, learn to program the key roll, and read how to program a synth.

58853,"Oh, fun. I'm honestly not sure of the accuracy of this list as I'm very prone to changing my mind, but let's try:

* **Hermès Kelly Caleche EDP**; cool rose and (suede) leather; a long-standing signature 
* **Terre d'Hermès EDT**; sophisticated unisex-masculine vetiver; currently on my third bottle 
* **Guerlain L'heure Bleue**; a nostalgic, post-war masterpiece that truly tells a story; incredibly evocative
* **Chanel Le Lion**; bold and spicy, yet elegant and chivalrous; a lovely study in contrasts 
* **Byredo Bal d'Afrique**; velvety lemon and bright, grassy vetiver; just joyful 
* **Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt**; a likeable, versatile skin scent that evokes a cosy fisherman's sweater;
* **Prada Infusion d'Iris**; cool, dreamy iris; a signature for years until my skin chemistry changed 
* **Ormonde Jayne Champaca**; gentle magnolia and green tea; reminiscent of a lover's palm cupping your face
* **Nishane Sultan Vetiver**; an old-fashioned, moneyed fougere with some funk; the newest addition onto my list and one I can't stop smelling 
* **L'Artisan La Chasse aux Papillons**; truly the scent of childhood innocence, like running in the fields with white sunshine",best perfume

56621,"I'll tell you this to consider when upgrading...basically anything.

Your wallet will always thank you for not getting the bells and whistles that you aren't used to and don't truly need. I'll give you an example: A backup camera on a vehicle. At first glance this doesn't seem like that big a deal, been backing up your entire life without one, never had an issue. The moment you get one though, every car from here on out that you buy...you will want that backup camera.

Stick with the TN. Some claim this and that over TN by IPS, but I have both. With a decent tn panel, it's not as big of a difference as most say it is.

Ps, the whole upgrading thing is true about all parts to a monitor though. You'll always want g-sync and always want 1440p now. Limit your own future 'must-haves'",best desktop monitor
