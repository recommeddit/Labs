59570,best perfume,"I’m so sorry but you are mostly wrong haha. 

Mid-20s, I do think I have good taste, I live in a… medium sized metropolitan area I guess? Though I prefer big cities. And alas, my apartment is not fully bare bones nor is it gross, but my ADHD has kept me from it being overly clean or very well decorated haha."
24535,best anime,">[K-On!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On)

Looking back at it, very little things happened and it still managed to be 10/10. Would watch people eat cake for 50 episodes again"

34628,best NFL player,Not really.  Rings are a more important stat than receiving yards lmao.
41158,best instrument to play,"Becoming proficient at any instrument without having ever practiced in your youth is probably not going to work out so great.  Not to be mean, but chances are you won't get past a basic level unless you can make up for all that lost practice time.  A computer is as much an instrument as the guitar someone has played since middle school, get Live, learn to program the key roll, and read how to program a synth.  

edit:grammer"
31484,best hotel to live in,"The Traders Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, amazing view of the Petronas Towers, best Breakfast  Buffet I've ever seen, plus a rooftop pool/bar on the 34th floor.

40372,best midrange GPU,"Is there a big difference in the 2060 compared to the 2070?

36111,best alcoholic drink,"There's a guy in my town who sits at the bar day and night. One night my friend and I asked him what drink to have, and he said ""The Rocky Mountain Bear Fucker"". Essentially the same idea, except I'm Canadian."
43489,best items under $100,In my opinion definitely a weighted blanket if you have a hard time sleeping at night or have anxiety. They have some at target for $25 currently :)
26375,best politician,Harry Truman had very little money and lots of expenses after leaving the White House. He became president when FDR died and left the presidency with only an army pension and some money leftover from selling his memoirs.

58853,best perfume,"Oh, fun. I'm honestly not sure of the accuracy of this list as I'm very prone to changing my mind, but let's try:

* **Hermès Kelly Caleche EDP**; cool rose and (suede) leather; a long-standing signature 
* **Terre d'Hermès EDT**; sophisticated unisex-masculine vetiver; currently on my third bottle 
* **Guerlain L'heure Bleue**; a nostalgic, post-war masterpiece that truly tells a story; incredibly evocative
* **Chanel Le Lion**; bold and spicy, yet elegant and chivalrous; a lovely study in contrasts 
* **Byredo Bal d'Afrique**; velvety lemon and bright, grassy vetiver; just joyful 
* **Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt**; a likeable, versatile skin scent that evokes a cosy fisherman's sweater;
* **Prada Infusion d'Iris**; cool, dreamy iris; a signature for years until my skin chemistry changed 
* **Ormonde Jayne Champaca**; gentle magnolia and green tea; reminiscent of a lover's palm cupping your face
* **Nishane Sultan Vetiver**; an old-fashioned, moneyed fougere with some funk; the newest addition onto my list and one I can't stop smelling 
* **L'Artisan La Chasse aux Papillons**; truly the scent of childhood innocence, like running in the fields with white sunshine"

67093,best places to skydive in california,"I recommend skydive california as well! Great and super professional dropzone. I'm there almost every weekend, weather permitting."
51501,best iphone case,I tried to do the same thing with AppleCare/no case... cause I thought this was the best way. But these newest phones are slippery. I found myself gripping my device more tightly than I’d like to during normal usage. My hand started to hurt and I ultimately bought an Apple silicon case and my hand pain went away since the case made it more “sticky” in my hand.
56621,best desktop monitor,"I'll tell you this to consider when upgrading...basically anything.

Your wallet will always thank you for not getting the bells and whistles that you aren't used to and don't truly need. I'll give you an example: A backup camera on a vehicle. At first glance this doesn't seem like that big a deal, been backing up your entire life without one, never had an issue. The moment you get one though, every car from here on out that you buy...you will want that backup camera.

Stick with the TN. Some claim this and that over TN by IPS, but I have both. With a decent tn panel, it's not as big of a difference as most say it is.

Ps, the whole upgrading thing is true about all parts to a monitor though. You'll always want g-sync and always want 1440p now. Limit your own future 'must-haves'"

33634,best electric car,"""Everyone should buy an EV yesterday"" people are annoying, but I'd argue the ""EVs are doomed to fail because the can't handle my 800-mile daily commute on a single charge, and there's no charging infrastructure a day's drive from civilization, which is where I live"" people are worse."
