69169,"I think that the thing with many liberal arts degrees is that you should only pursue that if you're really serious about it. If you have a true passion and an unusual aptitude, and you want to get a PhD, work in academia, and devote your life to Women's Studies or Chinese literature, by all means pursue it. But if this is not your plan, you might have a hard time with a BA in Women's Studies. For the hypothetical Women's Studies major, a more practical alternative could be, for example, to take Women's Studies as a minor or even a double major with Psychology or Social Work, and use your understanding of women's issues to do something like work with domestic abuse victims or rape victims. It's a practical, actionable career plan, beyond just finding the subject interesting, but having no clue how you're going to apply it careerwise.",best major to study in college

69345,"I got a BS in biotechnology, which would have been alright if I followed it up with a MS or PhD. If I could go back, I would definitely have majored in either nursing or clinical lab science because those two fields have a ton of job openings. They don't earn as much as some others might, but it's great to have the confidence of knowing you could live anywhere and still find a job quickly. For maximum earning potential with just a bachelors, I think computer science or IT is the way to go.",best major to study in college
