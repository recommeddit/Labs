53306,best usb c charging cable,I see why don't you just use the standard charger cable that came with the phone? USB 2.0 speed is more than enough unless you are like transferring 4k movie files or something.
47864,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Having completed a multivariable calculus class already, I'd say the ti-84 is all you need. I haven't taken linear algebra, though."
69169,best major to study in college,"I think that the thing with many liberal arts degrees is that you should only pursue that if you're really serious about it. If you have a true passion and an unusual aptitude, and you want to get a PhD, work in academia, and devote your life to Women's Studies or Chinese literature, by all means pursue it. But if this is not your plan, you might have a hard time with a BA in Women's Studies. For the hypothetical Women's Studies major, a more practical alternative could be, for example, to take Women's Studies as a minor or even a double major with Psychology or Social Work, and use your understanding of women's issues to do something like work with domestic abuse victims or rape victims. It's a practical, actionable career plan, beyond just finding the subject interesting, but having no clue how you're going to apply it careerwise."

69345,best major to study in college,"I got a BS in biotechnology, which would have been alright if I followed it up with a MS or PhD. If I could go back, I would definitely have majored in either nursing or clinical lab science because those two fields have a ton of job openings. They don't earn as much as some others might, but it's great to have the confidence of knowing you could live anywhere and still find a job quickly. For maximum earning potential with just a bachelors, I think computer science or IT is the way to go."
