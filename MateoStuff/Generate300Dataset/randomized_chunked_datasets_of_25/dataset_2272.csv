49497,"Definitely the XF270HUA (assuming it's the AHVA model). 

The G-Sync equivalents (PG279Q﻿, XB271HUA﻿) are almost €300 more, and the TN options are grossly overpriced (S2719DGF, HP Omen 27, XB271HAU, AG271QX).

While the TN options might be marginally faster, they are pretty mediocre (Omen 27, BX271HAU, AG271QX) or overpriced (S2719DGF), and the XF270UA will be almost as fast while having far better image quality.

The C27HG70 will be the fundamentally slowest option, though having the best contrast ratio.",best gaming monitor

2482,"I dont know if they are country wide or just local to my state, but I have Skullcandy ear buds. They are phenomenal. The pair I usually buy are around 25 bucks(depending), sound amazing and can take a beating. I have washed them, dunked them in water and Mt Dew, put them through some touch conditions. I dont think I have ever had a pair short out on me and the only time they have ever broken was when they got caught in my door and snapped. I seriously cant praise them enough. The best part is, they come with a manufactures warranty that if something does happen to them, you can send them in and exchange them. At least that is how they were. I have never had to, so I dont know if they do it anymore or not.",best headphones

27773,"I usually portion it out and just keep them in the fridge, then microwave it in the morning. I’m sure it would work well if you kept it in the pan too. I keep the portions either in Tupperware or in plastic bags, depending on how much space I have in my fridge. 

I have seen videos of people pre-making breakfast sandwiches with eggs, freezing them in parchment, and microwaving them in a damp paper towel or something like that but that’s too complicated for me so I just stick with the fridge. Hope this helps!",best breakfast foods

One year for my birthday he thought it would be funny to get a card with a Menorah on it and turn the ""happy Hanukkah"" into a ""happy birthday"" with a big sharpie.
