4882,best home improvement store,"Home Depot, I've always liked their selection. Lumber sucks but I do like their other stuff."
71204,best movies with a cool twist,"Primer was one of those movies you have to watch 2 or 3 times - but idk if it's so much of a ""OH MYGOD!"" twist as a ""say what now? hold on I gotta go back and watch it again"""

14564,best romantic novel,Is this one of the trauma porn books you mentioned?
34858,best NFL player,"Honestly happy he’s on here, although as a Steelers fan I could debate him against Minkah. 

Jesting aside though, Bates is so underrated on a national level and across non-AFCN fanbases it’s disturbing."
55173,best places to hike in the east coast,"Woo, always awesome to see upstate get some love."
8228,best toothpaste,glisten
10079,best pencil for drawing,I got a pack of pencils and it included two completely graphite ones. One of those broke in two different places. It's irritating because they're new and don't seem cheap.
46408,best trick or treating candy,"Like, temperature-wise?"
34486,best NFL player,Derrick Thomas
25685,best cricket teams of all time,Don't forget Amla! Prime Amla was the best SAF batsman in his team!
53580,best medicine for a cold,"My pediatrician always seemed to like the fact that I was against antibiotics unless we were sure it was necessary! My son is almost 5 and has never had one and I’m so happy about that:)

Unfortunately my daughter started getting them from the get-go, multiple rounds while I was in labor (group b strep) then after cleft repair surgery, another for chest infection, and another for ear infection. She’s 3 and overall healthy but I am convinced she gets sicker and stays sick longer when they catch the same bugs."
36120,best alcoholic drink,"I first had a pickleback shot at some bar in Brooklyn that is whiskey and bacon themed. The shot glass was creatively folded bacon. God bless that place.

EDIT: Lots of people asking me what the place was called... I honestly don't know cause I was wasted and I'm not a local. If you ask enough hipsters in Williamsburg about the ""whiskey and bacon place"" I bet you'll find it though!"

25885,best cricket teams of all time,"Pleasantly surprised seeing South Africa there. Wessels+Hansie's teams.

We had Pollock, Kallis, Donald, Ntini, Cullinan, the Kirstens, McMillan. I must be missing some other greats. Rice was too old to still play a major role. Hudson was OK, Dave Richardson was solid. I suppose Gibbs also played in that era. Jonty!, I almost forgot - his stats don't show it, but he was a major part of that team - I think not just his fielding, but his positive attitude was great. 

My brother would want me to say Snell - but he was never quite so good."
3867,best online college,"The only reason most people take an education is that ""stamp"" though.
I have thousands of lectures, hundreds and thousands of studies and books, millions of articles at my fingertips. If I want to learn, I can learn."
54415,best artisan mousepad alternatives,Thank you man. The GSR-SE is sold out but I definitely wanna look into the aqua control+ or the inked pad
25555,best cricket teams of all time,"> I've always thought Tendulkar was overrated.

Best ODI batsman ever for me. However, in tests, I'd take Kallis. I'd still take Tendulkar tho and have to push out Sanga."
44229,best items under $100,Oh dear god. This took me back.
8117,best toothpaste,"You probably mean McDoubles, as double cheeseburgers are a little pricier, and they just raised the price on the mcdouble too.  So you might get 40."
