3283,best webcamera,"Know you already got lot of replies, but just to summarize its a very advanced and streamlined macro.. deck? basically. 

But, if you ever did want to test it out without dropping $$$, they do have a mobile app (might only be on iOS not 100% sure) that you can subscribe for like $5 a month and try it out."
16023,best sunglasses for fashion,"[Krewe!](https://www.krewe.com/collections/st-louis-mirrored-1) I love these glasses. I like having one pair of nice glasses for wearing to brunch or shopping, and then having a bunch of cheap ones for boating, swimming, travelling. I need a prescription pair for driving though and I'm hoping to get something with a classic silhouette, maybe [Holly Golightly like](http://68.media.tumblr.com/0e8bcd29a93023a42bad010a39590278/tumblr_ncj4vrWwZ51qhekpro1_250.gif)."

67267,axios alternatives reddit,"Except those aren't really features.

Those HTTP codes have specific meanings and you really shouldn't be handling them the same way, they can also be used quite differently in different systems and with different APIs.

You're going to be writing some filter logic in most cases anyway.

And having the json cast be separate is also good as it allows you to handle connection errors separately from parsing errors, because again, those are two different things.

Axios requires less code if you don't care about handling your errors, but it's actually more code if you do."

15873,best sunglasses for fashion,"I haven't personally worn them, but the quality of construction is excellent. To say they're beautiful would be an understatement. As I recall, I was told by a huge gunglass guy that these were the best sunglasses he's ever worn in terms of both lens quality and how they look. Make sure you can pull of whatever pair you're thinking of before buying them, since they're pretty polarizing (no pun intended). If you can, I'd get them. These are very elegant sunglasses. 

Disclaimer: don't have a ton of experience with these guys. From what I can tell, they're a safe bet."
65869,best college in california,"Let's say there are two towns

Town A has budget of 100 million and 100 residents.

Town B has budget of 200 milion.and 10000 residents.

Virginia has good schools available to a much.higher percentage of citizens - -so.Virginia's system is better."

Ex's mother says: ""Looking for a way out?"" 

King responds: ""Aren't we all?"" and smiles.



Oh! I forgot--I met Native American character actor Wes Studi in a bar. He was kind of self-aggradizing. Wes, my next-door neighbors, and I went to a cigar bar after the first bar. He was flashing money around. He also ran his hand up my shin and commented ""Someone got waxed today."" Wow, dude."
