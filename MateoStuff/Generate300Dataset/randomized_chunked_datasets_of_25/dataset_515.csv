Those HTTP codes have specific meanings and you really shouldn't be handling them the same way, they can also be used quite differently in different systems and with different APIs.

Make sure you can pull of whatever pair you're thinking of before buying them, since they're pretty polarizing (no pun intended). If you can, I'd get them. These are very elegant sunglasses.
