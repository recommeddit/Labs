how big of a difference between i511th gen and ryzen 4500u?
"Some of them might be in the [runners-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/m5te6u/top_100_most_acclaimed_anime_series_of_all_time/gr1ynmu/).  If not, they might still enter the list in the future.  I'll probably to continue to update the top 100 as new lists get published."
"I predict a particular group of people is gonna look at this list and get triggered by it (particularly the top pick).

But the list itself looks ok though. Doesn't match my own exactly, but not a lot of really egregious stuff. I'd rank Infinity War noticeably higher, Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange somewhat higher, and Iron Man 3 somewhat lower, but that's pretty much it. I like your points system, it paints a pretty clear picture of the critical consensus on the 23 films.

Just for kicks, here's my ranking: 

1. Avengers: Endgame 
2. Captain America: The Winter Soldier 
3. Avengers: Infinity War 
4. Black Panther 
5. Guardians of the Galaxy 
6. Marvel's The Avengers 
7. Thor: Ragnarok 
8. Captain America: Civil War 
9. Iron Man 
10. Spider-Man: Far From Home 
11. Spider-Man: Homecoming 
12. Captain Marvel 
13. Doctor Strange 
14. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 
15. Captain America: The First Avenger 
16. Ant-Man and the Wasp 
17. Ant-Man 
18. Avengers: Age of Ultron 
19. Iron Man 3 
20. Thor 
21. Iron Man 2 
22. Thor: The Dark World 
23. The Incredible Hulk"
"I honestly really like both soft and xsoft. The xsoft is very cozy, it just is a little too squishy for my tastes as it seems to make my arm a bit warm from sinking in.

Honestly you can't go wrong with either soft or xsoft otsu v2."
"No, he’s just a mad man."
"AC Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla (origins my favourite)

Witcher 3

Dark Souls 3

Bloodborne

Sekiro

Deaths Door"
"I found a shoe I like, Brooks Ghost, and have never ventured out to try anything new.  Just keep buying what ever previous season's shoe is on sale.   

Will any of these new technologies make a difference for me?"
A bracelet with me and my siblings birthstones on it and a facial.
"The one downside to hotel living is that when the wifi bogs down because everyone is viewing porn or streaming netflix, you can't do anything about it, usually 4 pm in the afternoon to about 11 pm at night. I moved to a medium sized city in the US (Reno) and have stayed at a motel for longer than I thought, as I am in the process of buying a house, and its like $900 a month, no kitchen, although I have a hotplate (my own), microwave and a half-size refrigerator.  One brainiac brought in a propane camp stove and blew up his room (probably to cook a batch of meth, we guess). Back in the day, it was easier to get a kitchenette, but high insurance rates have made a lot of hotel owners remove the stoves and such. I discussed having my own direct internet cable put in, but the owner didn't want to mess with that. I worked years in construction and have stayed months/years at hotels and usually its a matter of asking when you check in for long term rates."
Oatmeal with trail mix.
If you don't need more than 60Hz you can by one of the professional FALD monitors from Asus. Otherwise pretty much the usual suspects until new ones come later down in the year.
"Seriously, the 360 is a great console to start off with. There are so many good games that were on that console, some of them, legendary."
How did I forget about nat geo. I loved that as a kid! Thank you!
Nice article
"A friend of mine has an orange living room and it looks really good. It's a smaller room and a deep orange. If the room were bigger, it might look life a circus."
Tnx will surf
"Sherlock, Lilyhammer, Saxondale, Arrested Development"
"We tried Codenames *once* with 4 people and there was a lot of downtime, minimal engagement, and the game mechanics were too simplistic for it to be actually interesting/fun.

I've watched so many reviews but I'm lost on what keeps people interested about it. A game of Betrayal at House on the Hill, or Pandemic kept people much more engaged. Personally I also like Azul, but I can't tell if I'm the only one, yet."
I use one because I take pen and paper notes. Some classes like language classes require you to bring books to class. I'd buy a cheap one if you don't want to use one all the time because chances are you'll need one eventually
"1/3” is bigger than a lot of smartphones. Tons of R&D goes into image processing there though, and I doubt that any of that effort gets applied to smartphones."
Wipe that shame off of your face. You're an adult now. Drive to the store and get yourself a bag of delicious dum-dum pops.
"For a newer computer, I'd recommend Kubuntu. For older hardware, I'd recommend Xubuntu.

From there I'd recommend Manjaro.

After that, I'd recommend Arch if you're trying to learn. Then Gentoo."
Laphroaig 10.  It is at the nexus of affordability with amazing Whisky.
"Totally different pace than the ones listed, but I love 24."
