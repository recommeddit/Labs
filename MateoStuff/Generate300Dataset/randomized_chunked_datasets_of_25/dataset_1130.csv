38465,"I get the Independent every Saturday and Sunday, and any weekday that I will have the time to read it (rare). I like the cryptic crossword, and there's also something soothing about reading the paper over a lazy weekend breakfast that the Internet and TV news just don't have.

I get the local newspaper once a week as well, but mainly for the job listings.

Edit: choice of paper is solely because it's the only well written UK paper I have come across that doesn't force political opinion down your throat. In terms of reporting style and content, I used to prefer the Telegraph, but don't like the bias in political reporting. I still sometimes cave and get the Sunday Telegraph, their crossword is far more challenging!",best newspapers to read

70023,"If anyone that comes along wants to be a Music Major of any kind, think extremely carefully about that choice. Taking on a Music Major is one of the roughest decisions you can make, and over half of my class dropped after the first semester, leaving them with 15+ hours of useless music credits. It is hard, the content is hard, you will have many days where you will be so buried beneath work, practice, and stress that you will not be able to breathe. You will spend MANY long nights stuck at school because of rehearsals and concerts you don't want to go to and you will have to do things that you're going to think are unorthodox and stupid. I stuck it out but I have a lot of friends that couldn't. Make that choice carefully, it's a four year+ commitment that you have to be sure you want.

EDIT: Just for clarification, I'm a sophomore now at the University of West Georgia and I'm a Music Education Major with a principle in percussion.

EDIT 2: A lot of people commenting on this make great points. All of the stress and such can be daunting, without a doubt. But that doesn't mean it isn't rewarding. Lots of people go into this program thinking it will be easy and that their love of music will pull them the whole way through. That is both true and untrue. If you love what you're doing, it's going to help you, and the more fun you make your major the more rewarding it will be and the less frustrating it will be. Enjoy the concerts you perform, enjoy the friends you're around, enjoy the things you study, and you're going to be okay. But at the same time, love alone will not get you through. You have to work hard, you have to study, you will have to do things that you legitimately do not want to do. But that isn't to say it isn't worth it. If you really feel like you can and want to do this, let nothing stop you. Strive to be the best you can be and play, sing, teach, or write your heart out. But if you think this is going to be an easy ride, you'll find out pretty soon that's not the case. Naturally I wish you all the best and I hope you enjoy it like myself and many others on this thread!",best major to study in college
