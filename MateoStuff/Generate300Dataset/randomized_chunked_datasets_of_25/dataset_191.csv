I found a gorgeous 9x12 foot Persian carpet for $125, cost a bit more then that to ship it from Boston to NYC. Similar rugs might sell for $5000 and up at ABC Carpet & Home"

Seriously? For two years nothing better than Cloud Flight appeared on the market?

They're okay for me, good for gaming and voip, but they're missing one thing that'd make them golden: ANC. I tried to use them in open space at the office, and the lack of noise isolation/ANC clearly shows. I can't get back to a wired headset, so I guess I'll just stop searching and accept that there's no wireless headset with ANC and decent mic, which does NOT rely on ancient Bluetooth HSP/HFP."

73284,best Linux distro,"I haven't read your previous post but here's my input anyway:

1) As a beginner you should chose a Windows PC and install linux on another partition (dualboot). That way you don't burn your bridges, some apps are just not available on linux. I've used linux as my main OS for about 15 years but as much as I prefer linux I still keep a Windows 10 partition, just in case.

2) Of the 3 distros you mention Linux Mint is without doubt the one to chose for a linux novice. It has all the bells and whistles and a huge selection of apps available. I believe they have a friendly community/forum too. (I'm not a Mint user myself these days, its too heavy for my ancient laptop.)"

Fuck giftcards.

50706,best rap album,"1. Smiling With No Teeth by Genesis Owusu is great front to back, nothing but hits

2. BUZZCUT is the best beat Brockhampton's had in forever, absolutely addictive

3. Denzel on the Bruuuh remix (tbh there haven't been many features that've stood out to me this year)


4. Danny's first verse on Welfare is ridiculous, would love an entire album where he's in ODB mode

5. NAINAINAI by ATARASHII GAKKO isn't usually my sound but that entire song is just addictive

6. the original cover isn't it but the deluxe Roadrunner cover is gorgeous

7. Unlocked 1.5, none of the beats fit as well as the originals and most of the features were mid - no reason to go back to it when the original is so much better

8. The Koreatown Oddity! Little Dominique's Nosebleed was one of last year's best albums and I totally missed it

9. I don't seem to like the new Slowthai as much as everybody else - thought it was fine but a lot of the songs seemed underdeveloped and half baked to me

10. Everybody should listen to Smiling With No Teeth immediately"

If you want to stay with the current version, yes. If you want to upgrade to version 4 sometime (I assume that version 4 will be released one day) then you have to pay again.

>It's well worth paying for.

I wouldn't disagree here. Therefore I didn't give any instructions how to deactivate the Nag-Screen.

>The message for getting a licence only pops up when you open Sublime Text and when you go to save things.

I have received the Nag screen only at irregular intervals when saving."

I also am more attracted to its UI than that of the Xbox. Yet Xbox is the more powerful console and I do already own games for it I can play on PC. I feel like I just answered this for myself but Iâ€™m literally so indecisive
