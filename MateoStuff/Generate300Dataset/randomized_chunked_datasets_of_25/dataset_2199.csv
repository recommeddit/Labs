34712,"Jerry Rice. He is the only unanimous best player at his position. His stats are unbreakable, his longevity, and arguably his prime was the best the NFL has ever seen among the WR position. 

But if there was an all-time NFL draft and I had #1 overall pick I'd take Peyton Manning since I think you'd be foolish not to take a QB  in that situation and he would be the sure fire dominant player regardless of whatever team he would be stuck with.",best NFL player

47601,"This is Virginia, for anyone trying to ctrl+f. 

Speaking of historical sites, I'd also recommend Monticello in Charlottesville (then go hit up the outdoor mall, which, as a VT alum, it pains me to admit is actually quite lovely), Montpelier (really beautiful drive to get there especially), and especially Mount Vernon, which underwent some real improvements in the past 5-10 years and blew my mind when I went back. 

If you go to Mount Vernon, I'd also recommend spending some time in Old Town Alexandria - it's a really cool old section of the city with great restaurants, shopping, and is easy to walk around. Arlington National Cemetery is very close by too, between a 20min and 5hr drive depending on traffic and time of day.

Southwest VA has some really beautiful scenery, but not a lot of things in particular I can think of other than the Natural Bridge and good hiking. If you're driving south to North Carolina, I'd also recommend you take 81-77 rather than hugging the coast, because the views from the mountains around the state border are breathtaking, especially in the morning when it's still foggy in the valleys.",best state to visit in the United States
