37138,"Oh I completely agree. Last time we were at Cedar Point, we played ""guess which coasters are currently down despite perfect weather"". It was a really fun way to pass the time, because at all hours of the day(s) we visited, we'd find ourselves in line for a ride and we had a blast just going down the list and trying to guess which coasters were down.

The funnest part was each morning, when we would round the park and queue for Millennium Force (told it was opening late), then run to Maverick and be told they didn't know when it would open, only to go to Vengeance and be told it may not open at all that day, then to give up and go to Gemini and see a chain across the front without them even staffing an attendant to explain it wasn't open. Same with Mine Ride which was at least cycling empties. Finally we found Magnum open with no wait, rode it, then made our way over to Dragster which still hadn't opened.

We did this exact crawl through the park in some form each day and almost always found more coasters closed than open in the back half of the park well after the posted open time.

Cedar Point is a damn joke when it comes to ride up time. I've never seen a park with so many problems keeping rides up for a few hours at a time or even bothering to open on time. And I really, really don't want to hear about ""weather"" or ""safety"". Every other park has this stuff figured out.

Now in terms of SFMM being any better? That's not even a debate. CP is still better in their attempt to open things. SFMM just throws up a sign and calls it a day. It's always a major gamble to see just which SFMM coasters will bother to attempt to open. Back in the mid 2000's I have pictures of the ""closed today"" signs outside the park overflowing and unable to hold all of the plaques for the amount of rides down. On any given day, at least 3 or 4 headliners were closed with half a dozen more smaller rides and it was like that in the middle of the summer. I can't remember them all, but my friends and I considered it a badge of honor when all 4 B&M's, Superman, Ninja, Deja Vu, and of course X were all down for the day during Fright Fest in 2005 I believe.",best amusement park

I recommend the Fever Series by Karen M Moning everywhere. All the time. If you ask for a random series suggestion with no specifics, this is the one I will give you. If you ask for fantasy, I will recommend this. Alpha hero? Fever Series. Heroine that shows growth throughout the series? Fever Series. It's become a problem.",best romantic novel
