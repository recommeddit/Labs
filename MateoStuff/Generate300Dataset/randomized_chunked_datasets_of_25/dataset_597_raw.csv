"For example the 2007 Darwin Award winner who succumbed to a 3 litre sherry enema: http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2007-13.html

EDIT: Sherry is usually around 17% ABV, so that's half a litre of alcohol."
"This is just about every Saw movie, but the first did it the best."
Obama is one of the best American speech makers ever. Easily the best in my lifetime.
John dies at the end is garbage. No. Ray Bradbury or Kurt Vonnegutt? Come on.
I've just started the navigation section and I'm loving it. Some say Redux should not be taught but I was able to understand everything quite well. Stephen is a great communicator.
"[Life is Strange ](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/life-is-strange/id1180101534?l=en) and [Life is Strange : Before the Storm ](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/life-is-strange-before-storm/id1293250289?l=en) ( Life is Strange Prequal ) 
Both free with 12.99$ for all episodes"
"I feel like every long romance series has a book like Zsadist and Bella.  In the Psy/Changling books it's book #3 Caressed by Ice.  The basic premise is seriously damaged hero who the heroine falls in love with and she has to work her ass off to win him over because he feels like he's too damaged.  Though with the Psy/Changling books you do need to read book 2 because it leads into book 3.  However, several of the books in the series might be a good match like Heart of Obsidian or Kiss of Snow.  


If you're really into tortured heroes then The League series by Sherrilyn Kenyon is perfect.  Every hero goes through a horrific childhood and is unloved and betrayed by those closest to him.  Also, there's always a scene where someone/many people who don't like the hero get their comeuppance or find out that they acted crappily."
Insoles for your shoes.  I had no idea until I got some good ones what a difference it makes.
"Does it matter how GOOD a game was (metacritic) rating for its value? 

Good games = higher value in 5 years?"

I remember for years thinking those were bad just because I listened to my sibling and friends.
Could be. I’ve always liked LoCoSuMo more so no complaints from me
"My mother is grateful, if I decide to spend additional days in my hometown on christmas. The gift from my side can be a very small one, but should I spend more time with my mom, she's the happiest person on earth."

"For close to sim-racing you're options are pretty lacking on Switch. Check out GRID Autuosport as that is probably the best, especially if you want to race against other cars. If you're OK with racing without other people then the WRC games are fantastic and allow tons of customization. But it's only rally racing and you don't race against other drivers."

If you are a fan of the Blues I would say the [Mississippi Blues trail](http://msbluestrail.org/index.aspx).
"Cats provide companionship and affection, a belly to scratch, a responsive meow or purr, a buddy to curl up with on the couch, a friend to play with, etc. Cats are wonderful in their own way, and honestly it sounds like you could enjoy one very much."
"Don’t buy shitty USB C hubs off Amazon too! 90% of them are wholesale crap which breaks easily and overheats. Stick with Anker, Belkin, Satechi"
"Depends on what you're looking for in a Halloween event. Best haunted houses and scares are usually at HHN at Universal (Orlando is usually better, but Hollywood is good too). If you're looking for a more family centered event (with minimal scares or less strobe lights, which is a big thing for me) there's of course the Disney Parks, but I've heard HersheyPark is cool too, since they do some special things to some rides and don't really have scarezones or houses (And I'm actually going to their Halloween event this year)."

We just got back from the Andaz Maui. Opened in Sept 2013 so less than 1 year old. Spectacular views. Management even left a bag filled with jams on our door when we asked where we could buy that brand. Now that's taking care of your guests!
I play COD and Brawl Stars and they set it up so it’s not really Pay to Win. Fair games lots of free loot boxes. Good fun all around. More so BS than COD.
