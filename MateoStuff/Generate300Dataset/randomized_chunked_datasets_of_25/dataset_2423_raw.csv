"Honestly, I have no clue. We have a lab tech who is in charge of the shared facilities equipment in the room (autoclaves and such) so for the a great deal of science I hope the answer is ""often"". I've always had clean electropherograms on my CE, but come to think of it, we have had some strange results on some PCR's the undergrads have run. Thanks for the tip and I'll check in with the tech at some point about this.

Question is when do you sell ;)
"Currently use chrome mainly, but since it's become a massive resource hog, I've been trialing Firefox quantum on my htpc and am so far liking it. May switch to that for my main browser."
