"Have you actually jumped in Lodi? Because I have, and we all wore seat belts. I have no idea what you're on, but that's just not true.

Once again, I'm not saying Lodi is perfect. It's got its problems, including what I perceived as failures of safety culture, that made me stop jumping there.

i got a BenQ EW2440L about 7 months ago and i really can't recommend it enough.
Well whiskey. I'm cheap.

"In the US a lot of houses have private wells for their water, and therefore aren't necessarily following all the requirements. I haven't got the slightest clue what the laws are about creating a new well, but I know that old wells were not monitored/tested (or at least not well) for drinkability."
Can i install zebra and keep cydia as well on Uncover.?
"Just listen to the [Chinese version by Jackie Chan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SLJJc8siyU), which is naturally much more badass than the Donny Osmond original ;)"
For some reason I will always picture Joe Green as Moe Green from the Godfather.
Jo koy was really good.
"Just in case you want input from the much more skeptical POV (i.e. I generally hate these films), to me the good ones are Iron Man, The Avengers and Thor: Ragnarok."
"No, I agree. I've read them all and The Diamond Age remains a personal favorite. It just has a different feel than the others."
"Completely agree with that, what’s wrong with chronology?"
"Burberry London, Lattafa Raghba and Lattafa Qaa’ed are all great cheapies."

I feel like coffee ice cream in general is underrated. It’s so good! It tastes like it was *meant* to be an ice cream flavor.
The whole Sprint is half the price and only 1% less coverage thing makes a huge difference. Do you know how many times I’m in a place where Sprint users are trying to get a signal and I’m already 10 steps ahead with Verizon? It’s worth the price.

"I bought the Three Body Problem through one of those ""blind date with a book"" things, where it's wrapped in brown paper and they only give you a small description. I don't read a ton of sci fi, so I'm hoping I enjoy it!"

"Packaging science is exactly what it sounds like, a major dedicated to everything packaging. At my school, we learn everything from packaging machinery, design using solids works and audios cad, to material science. Jobs are likewise very diverse; I know people working in packaging supply chains, making the big bucks in medical packaging, and even people working on greener packages. Packaging is the biggest industry no one thinks about, everything comes in a package."
