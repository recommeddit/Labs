8302,"Dentists definitely recommend electric toothbrushes! I was recommended one years ago when I had a case of acute gum infection and the hygienist I seen recently also asked if I use one. 

I'm prone to having problems with my gums because my teeth are tightly packed, meaning food gets stuck and it's incredibly hard for me to floss. It's cleaning **between** your teeth and under your gumline that so many people miss!",best toothpaste

So you really should be flexible with language skills.   I'd seriously consider Python and Java as good starting places.    Python really is a tool that you can use no matter where you career goes even if used for nothing but simple scripts.

33732,"My Model 3 has been the best winter car I've ever driven, there's never a concern about ""will it crank"" there's no warmup time needed, it's an incredible cold weather (-20F) car. 

Hydrogen is DOA. There's too much energy loss taking electricity, making hydrogen, storing it, then turning it back into electricity before using it to move the car, when you could just take electricity and move the car.

The biggest disadvantage of hydrogen by far though is that you don't have a hydrogen fueling station in every building, but every building (in the developed world, anyway) has electricity. Therefore any parking spot is already a charging spot, with enough planning. Often with no more work than an extension cord.",best electric car
