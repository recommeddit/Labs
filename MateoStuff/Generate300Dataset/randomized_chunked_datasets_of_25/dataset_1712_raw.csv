"Yes, the new paper is good, but builds on the results of the first.  It adds several new characteristics, and refines their previous discussion of angiogenesis and biologic immortality.  Anyone wanting to read it can find it [here](http://pharmacology.ucsd.edu/graduate/courseinfo/Block5-RecReading-2011%20Weinberg%20Updated%20Review.pdf) (pdf).  I would suggest reading it after the first."
It's like a pussy that can suck dick.
"It depends on your location /population density , Verizon works best in most areas on postpaid plans , in some areas it’s congested but vzw has a dense grid so they’re still the best in suburbs and rural areas"

"Well Met by Jen DeLuca is one of my favs to recommend! (Believable) Enemies to lovers trope, normal people with normal problems and normal lives, largely based at a Renaissance faire - which I wasn’t sure I’d like but I thought I’d give it a shot. And loved it! I actually bought the paperback AND the e-version because I love it so much."

My wife and mother of my child wants a beer brewing kit.
"Honest question here - what would the vector of attack be, in theory? How would you launch a DoS against the client?"

How hard is it to get sunglasses in my prescription? I can't wear these over my actual glasses obviously
"We used to let people play ""Duck shots"" (I have NO idea where the name came from) but if there were three of you, you all got given a piece of ice and threw it at the back bar - which ever three bottles of liquor you hit - they went into your shot! Actually came up with some crackers!"
"You'd probably get a response like this:

""Brandon Sanderson is a Mormon. However, I highly recommend his books. You should definitely read..."""

"I've actually picked up two copies of the 12 player pack for Telestrations so we can play with large groups.

It's a total must play and we always look forward to being able to play it.

My advice for the game is to effectively forget about the rules entirely. Ignore the dice, ignore the drawing and writing rules, just do what is fun. It's a game built on the foundation of simply having a good time.

We also frequently pull out other games for cards like Bucket of Doom and CAH. That really gets the ball rolling lol"

Islay preferably.
"That's not even necessary, you can just find greedy rich assholes and do what *they* want."

Thanks for the help! I'll probably do something with it later this week.
"> I'm not sure since these pairs must be around 15 years old or something.

This is why these are the correct answer."
Nestle drains the aquifers of many cities. It is literally just tap water in a bottle. Source: lived next to a Nestle bottling plant that drained our aquifers and put us in water shortage.
I've been charging mine in the microwave. It's much faster.
"Assuming that we are talking about main line games:

It’s a tie between 3 for my favorite and I don’t have the time to explain the reasoning for each, but it’s between Platinum, Black2/White2, and HeartGold/SoulSilver.

Least favorite is Sword/Shield because it has so much potential, but it was all wasted. The Wild area was fun to explore for the first half hour, but then it lost its charm. Meanwhile every other area in the games is so linear and has zero exploration in it.  Not to mention as a Switch game it has so many problems that other Switch games don’t have (Such as stuff spawning under my feet). Also the story is horrible and there is nowhere new to explore after you beat the main story at all (unless you pay an extra $30)
In short, it’s objectively the worst Pokémon game in my opinion. If I can give one thing to it though, the new Pokémon introduced were pretty good."
its this one correct?
