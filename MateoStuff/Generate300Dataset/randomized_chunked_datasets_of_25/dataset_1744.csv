24833,best spiderman actor,"Toby Maguire by a good mile; Although, Hollan might surpass him depending on what he and his team can offer in the next spiderman movie. Let's just not mention Garfield, he tried his best.

Never really understood why everyone liked the idea that Spiderman needs to be teenager. Holland makes spiderman look cool and fun, but he just looks too childish doing it. Why not just call him spiderboy rather than spiderman? It just doesn't feel right. Toby's first movie gave him this aura of maturity without making him look too childish. 

We'll see in the next movie if he's good enough to not need Ironman's baby sitting services, then maybe we can call him spiderman."
