14657,best romantic novel,"Okay, I've read a lot of romance novels in the past few years, and I have some favorites.

First off, a lot of books are poorly written and not particularly imaginative, but I tend to enjoy the genre regardless because I'm guaranteed a happy ending. That being said, I think you should define what you mean by 'best' - do you want stuff that's creative and doesn't fall into the same common tropes that all romance novels have? Do you want something that's ""well-written"" (whatever that may mean)? Do you want solid characters who go through personal growth throughout the book?

Anyway, I looked at the synopsis of Searching for Always, and I must say that I would never read that book (unless I was in a situation where it was the only thing to read). It sounds like it takes itself entirely too seriously, which is never a good thing in a romance novel. Part of the reason why I love the genre is that it's utterly absurd and the authors know it. 

I have a few favorites, and I'll describe them and why I think they're so great. (Also, a quick aside about terminology - the heroine is the female protagonist, the hero the male. ""HEA"" is happily-ever-after). Anyway, here's the list:

* [**The Windflower** by Laura London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/679702.The_Windflower). This book is a bit of a behemoth at 540 pages, and takes a little while to get to the action, but I like it because it's so utterly full of tropes and ridiculousness.  Our heroine, Merry Wilding (no shit that's her name) is the traditional innocent-doesn't know she's beautiful-naive-excessively exuberant type of heroine. Through several inexplicable events, she ends up on a pirate ship. The story wends its way through some unbelievable shenanigans before landing at its HEA. This book also lightly touches on a few historical events, as it's set during the War of 1812. Unfortunately, it was written 1984, so it's solidly Old Romance and has a few of the less appetizing tropes of the era (i.e. poorly defined consent).

* [**The Iron Duke** by Meljean Brook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7864587-the-iron-duke). I would classify the subgenre of this book as ""steampunk romance"". Our heroine, Mina Wentworth, is one of the very few female detectives in a steampunk Victorian London. The hero is Rhys Trahaearn, the man who stopped the Horde from the continuing to enslave the population of England (the book explains this far better than I am now). Rhys is also a bit of a hermit, shunning the adoration of the crowds for a solitary life on his estate. Somehow a body is dropped on his estate, and Mina is called in to investigate. If you thought The Windflower sounded ridiculous, this book beats it. At one point Mina rappels out of an airship over open water to shoot a kraken with a harpoon gun. There are also zombies, and a surprising level of social commentary regarding racism and poverty. Somehow, the romance is enhanced rather than overshadowed by the elaborate setting. If you're okay with some suspension of disbelief, and books that laugh at themselves, I would definitely recommend this one.

* [**A Night to Surrender** by Tessa Dare](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10429836-a-night-to-surrender). This book is an example of the more traditional historical romance, but with a decidedly modern bent. It's also the first book of the Spindle Cove series, which is set in a picturesque little English town where spinsters and the painfully shy ladies of the Regency period go to hide from marriage. I'm not sure if I'd say that it's my favorite in my series (I'd say that honor belongs to the second book, A Week to Be Wicked) but it's a good place to start. The heroine of the story is Susanna Finch, self-appointed leader of the spinsters. The hero and part-time villain is Victor Bramwell, assigned by the Regent to start a militia in the town. Susanna and Victor but heads and then other body parts. It's a delightful read, and well-illustrates the modern approach to the historical romance.

* [**Burn for Me** by Ilona Andrews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20705702-burn-for-me). I think I'm cheating a bit by including this, because there's no HEA (it's a series in progress) yet, but I love this book and it has more romance than it should. Our heroine, Nevada Baylor, is a private detective charged with bringing in an exceedingly dangerous man. When I say dangerous, I mean that this is a magical universe and the guy can control fires. Nevada fortunately has magical powers of her own, but in order to finish the job she enlists the help of Connor Rogan, the most magically powerful ~~bachelor~~ man in the country (also a bit of a hermit; that's kind of a thing with romance). Sparks fly (hah), things get steamy (literally and figuratively), and the next book comes out in 19 days. I'm mentioning this book here because it has a fair amount of romance (and a decidedly romantic cover) but is also extremely fast-paced and engrossing.

* [**Rock Addiction** by Nalini Singh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22839846-rock-addiction). Before I describe this book, I want to say that Nalini Singh has two FANTASTIC paranormal romance series (the Angel series and the Psy-Changeling series) but I've already talked about two other pararom books and I need to add a contemporary romance one. This book is standard rock-star romance - hero is a rock star, heroine is an ordinary girl who just wants to stay out of the spotlight. It's possible that I enjoyed this book for the smut more than for the plot, but that sometimes happens. Anyway, this is a very cute book (I'd even use the word 'sweet'), and delivers its HEA right on schedule.

* [**Servant of the Crown** by Melissa McShane](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25777000-servant-of-the-crown). Sorry, the list was missing a proper fantasy romance, so here it is. In this book, the heroine is Alison Quinn, a bookselling/ printing Countess who just wants to sell books (dammit). Regrettably, her title comes with certain responsibilities, and she's called to the capital city to spend a year as a lady-in-waiting for the Queen's dowager mother. At her first ball, she unintentionally catches the eye of the 'playboy' prince Anthony (the Queen's brother), he drunkenly hits on her, she slaps him and causes a scene, and as punishment they are forced to show the public that there is no animosity between them. This cordiality is shown in the form of public outings together, and they naturally start to fall for each other. I added this book because there's some real maturation for both Alison and Anthony, and because the second half has a fantastic plotline (involving the Royal Library) that runs alongside the romance. The book is not without its faults (the Big Misunderstanding of the novel was a favorite for teen movies in the 90s) but it's good enough that just writing this synopsis made me want to reread it.

If you tell me the sorts of books you usually like, I could give you a more specific recommendation. Also, I only read the first of the Death books by J.D.Robb (Nora Roberts) and wasn't interested in reading further, so you're not the only one to have given up on that series.

Finally, I don't think I can even get started on the worst ones I've read (50 shades comes to mind) because there are so many that are truly awful. Sorry about that :)

edit: I have no self-control and added another book.

edit2: I forgot about a few. Honorable mentions to Warprize by Elizabeth Vaughn, Paper Princess by Erin Watt, Bad Boys Do by Victoria Dahl, The Royal We by Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, Trade Me by Courtney Milan, and Three Wishes by Kristen Ashley. I'm not going to claim that all of these are objectively good, but I absolutely loved them all.

Also, for the record, I read 124 romance novels last year."

68166,best science fiction novel,"Well, this is impossible, but what the hell:I love Herbert, Simmons,  Miéville, et. al. so I am going to try to add a few who aren't listed by some of the others.

Wm. Gibson, Count Zero--the sequel to Neuromancer.  I think it is a better novel and it can be read as a stand alone.

Jack Vance--Tales of the Dying Earth--love the genre and he is the master of it.  Science fantasy at its best. (although Gene Wolfe's Book of the new Sun is close second).

Ursula K. LeGuin, The Lathe of Heaven, just because her other two gems were already listed and I think this one is a poetic gem that rewards with each rereading.

Olaf Stapledon, Last and First Men--really anything by him but this one, and Star Maker are profound.

Michael Swanwich, The Iron Dragon's Daughter--he has several good books but this is the one I loved the best."
48746,best gaming monitor,"Hey friend I know this is way late and you probably already have your monitor but usually dark rooms do fine because your monitor is its own light source. It may affect color but that can be adjusted. Usually you only have to worry about bright lights/natural light because they will be more or less ""fighting for your eyes bandwidth"" with the light your monitor puts out. Your eyes can only take in so much light signal and the more noise/light you don't care about seeing there is, the ""louder"" the light signals from your monitor need to be for them to look clear and nice. Hence why many movie/home theaters are very dark. Projectors work by needing to already bounce the image once off a surface, and you pretty much have twice the amount of noise to inter the image since its image is usually traveling twice as far before reaching your eyes"

35873,best alcoholic drink,Commercial moonshine is pretty much garbage compared to the real thing unfortunately. It just doesn’t taste the same as the shit your buddy’s grandpa has squirreled away and won’t tell you who makes it. Most of the time commercial stuff is just as strong as your typical hard liquors at 40% abv too. Gimme some of that real peach pie or real apple pie moonshine and I’ll be your friend forever! Getting blasted on that stuff is truly a unique experience.
