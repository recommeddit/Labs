37799,best Marvel movie,Thor 2 lol
37967,best Marvel movie,Yeah the audience score is way more reliable. Sometimes I feel with rotten tomatoes that they have random movie critics review them and not actual fans of the franchise. Like black panther is good and all but would any true marvel fan have it absolute number one? (Some tru fans  obviously have too but I mean in general)

22253,best celebrity,Charles Barkley.  He was the grand opening of the casino hotel in which I work. He was very friendly and funny.
33323,best electric car,I don’t disagree with you in the interim… which is why I said “once the batteries are replaced”.
9086,best toothpaste,"There are like 20 brands out there, some even like I said are a ""band"" not even floss. Some are re-usable, you just change the roll of floss so the handle is a lot sturdier than the disposable version. Shop around a bit! Or eat celery after each meal, whatever!"
26472,best politician,"A SuperPAC, unfortunately."
71227,best movies with a cool twist,That was the plan :)
37498,best amusement park,Knott's is pretty high on the list of theme parks I'd say

59254,best perfume,I've been wearing it for almost 10 now. It's so light and refreshing! I just can't even look at anything else lol
57202,best water brand,"I remember seeing a video of someone testing each bottles water for different minerals, chemicals, additives, ph levels etc. it was actually really fascinating. If I recall correctly, Dasani was pretty bad."
3102,best webcamera,"Selfie cams are rarely attached to $1000 phones, because most people dont buy those models."
36927,best roller coaster at six flags,For me the best part about the roar is the firstdrop after that the ride seems really rough.
64580,Best Nike running shoes,"Not the OP, but for me it's the matter of price. I'm can't afford to get shoes from specialty running store, but with Nike I can get decent pair of running shoes for half the price, maybe even less. I go almost exclusively to Nike factory store, and my last shoes Downshifter 6  and Winflo 3 cost me $30 and $65 respectively. 

Once I'm more financially stable I'd like to try different shoes like the Asics gel series or some New balance or others. For now though, my Nike's are treating me well, and are affordable."
29197,best web hosting service,"Definitely [Dreamhost](https://reddlink.tech/dreamhost). Solid cheap hosting, very affordable domains, etc. Don't go with Siteground, they're scammy."

8257,best toothpaste,Burt's bees toothpaste with novamin in the afternoon and Clinpro at night. Soft bristled manual brush.
59259,best perfume,"Its a nice scent but I dont know why would anyone want to make it their signature scent since literally everyone wears it. I smell it everywhere all the time,  on the subway, in stores etc. 2 women in my office wear it too."
