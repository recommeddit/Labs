37967,Yeah the audience score is way more reliable. Sometimes I feel with rotten tomatoes that they have random movie critics review them and not actual fans of the franchise. Like black panther is good and all but would any true marvel fan have it absolute number one? (Some tru fans  obviously have too but I mean in general),best Marvel movie
