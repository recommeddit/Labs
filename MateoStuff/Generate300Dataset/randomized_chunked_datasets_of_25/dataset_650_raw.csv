"I’ve grown up with well water and honestly can’t stand tap water that comes from the city, although this definitely varies in different locations. Because of the treatment it usually tastes chemical-ish to me. Bottled water is more hit or miss though."

"> Home depot has changed their dog policy. The one in my area said we couldn't bring him in there.

It has always been a per-store policy. Most stores allow them, but I have been to both HD and Lowes stores that didn't."

"i can see how costs have gone up due to coivd and in general cleaning. 

out of curiosity i would like to know how much you make an hour actually in someones mouth considering hygienists do about 70% of the work (100% in my case).

""go more often"". so my dentist can make more money doing nothing? sounds like something a dentist would say. :)

im almost 50 i have had 3 cavities in my life all before i was 16 when i never brushed my teeth at all.  i only brush once a day in the morning now. i have had my saliva tested by a dentist because they wanted to know how my mouth stays so good with little care. i have a rare enzyme that protects my teeth naturally i am told.

once every 5 years is enough considering i always have a great record with no issues. the longest i have spent at a dentists lately is for xrays. like i said i usually spend about 5 - 10 min in the chair.

could there not be a setup in charging based more on the work needed and less on a set $X/appointment. maybe i would pay $40 to have my teeth cleaned and john with a bad mouth would pay $200 to have his cleaned. that seems more in tune with cost vs work."
">Is it the same thing in smaller dosages

In general, yes. The other main difference is just that it comes as flavored chewable tablets or liquids, for kids who can't swallow pills.

Zarbees does not do anything besides coat the throat with honey - but that's not necessarily nothing, it can soothe a sore throat and lessen the cough reflex. But if you find it's not doing enough, pick up something with real medicine in it."
