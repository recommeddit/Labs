16297,"I've got a pair of their original models and they were decent, the lenses got a little damaged when I took them into salt water at the beach and it seeped in between the layers of the lenses. When it dried there was some bubbles at the edge of the lenses, otherwise they are still in great shape. My wife got a pair of the newer ones and they are significantly better quality, the SS is a nice touch and the lenses seem better. 

I will personally never spend $100+ on sunglasses again. For $50 these satisfy my need. I live in Colorado where it is sunny 300+ days a year. I have had Raybans, Persols (are better quality but still do not justify their price imo), and a few other designer brands.",best sunglasses for fashion
33285,"I'd agree with the above that it's ID.4 vs. F-150.  I suggest:

* Price out both, really looking seriously at what options you would get.

* Also look at kWh/mi and consider what that would cost you, paying for electricity or for buying a bigger solar array.

Both are great vehicles and great values.

Consider also that the F-150 is a lot more likely to lethal to a pedestrian in a crash.  It should be driven slower and more carefully if you are in a neighborhood or downtown area.",best electric car

31097,"You have air conditioning though so I think you are forgetting that. I moved to Scotland from the Midwest (lived in Kansas and Texas). I thought this as well but what you don’t realise is that high 70s and low 80s are brutal when you have zero air conditioning and we’ve had a ton of that weather this year. 

If you don’t believe me go a week in spring when it’s high 70s low to mid 80s in Texas without turning anything on - no a/c, not even the fan. Then come back and tell me that’s nice weather. Lol.

Edit: oh and make sure that week is full of rain but still warm. Because that’s the weather here. Very high humidity because we all live close to the coast and it rains constantly. If you are from Houston then you’ll understand spring blows without ac.",best country to live in

40349,"That's a seriously bad build for a graphics card anywhere near that budget. 

When using an AMD CPU with integrated graphics, half the GPU PCIe lanes gets bifurcated to the iGPU. As a result you have PCIe X8 going to the graphics card instead of PCIe X16. 

Ryzen G APUs are a generation behind. The 3000G is actually a 2000. The 4000G is actually a 3000. As a result, AMD jumped from 3000 to 5000 to fix this naming issue. The 3600 would be a much better choice for $7, the i5-10400 is a much more affordable choice with comparable gaming performance. 

For $3 more, I would recommend the Gigabyte A520m Aorus Elite - it has much better voltage regulating (8 stage vs 6 stage), a better Ethernet LAN, RGB, and full PCIe 3.0 support. (The B450 chipset itself supplies PCIe 2.0 lanes). 

With a GPU under $1,000, you can easily have 1440P performance. A 1080P 60FPS monitor is a bad choice. 

With the higher end GPUs in this price point, you would want a 650+ watt PSU. 

The best bang for the buck card currently is the Nvidia 1650 Super. The RTX 3050 (regular/TI/Super) will totally destroy this. Manufacturers are scared to make old graphics cards, because they will be seriously devalued with RTX 30 cards. Many 1650 Super models have been discontinued. 

It's basically a challenge to get any graphics card at a reasonable price right now. Trump added a 25% Tariff that started January 1st that doesn't help.",best midrange GPU
