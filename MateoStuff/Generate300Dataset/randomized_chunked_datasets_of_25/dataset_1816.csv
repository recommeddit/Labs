73765,best matte screen protector for ipad,"If youre taking notes im pretty sure you wouldn’t be focused on the screen’s quality that much (or in my case I’m not really paying attention to it at all), you can start off with a matte and see how you like it and if you hate it then just take it off and go with glass. 

Notes on glass sucks but you end up getting used to it after a while; I’ve gone from matte to glass to matte just cause I hated writing on the glass. I could care less about how the screen looks cause my eyes do adjust and it’s barely noticeable.. 

My advice since you said mainly for notes: matte :)"
