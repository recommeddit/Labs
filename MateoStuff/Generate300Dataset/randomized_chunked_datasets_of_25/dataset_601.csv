46228,best trick or treating candy,"Don't listen to him. Tootsie rolls are worse than dum dums. Also, every kid hates Mary Janes."
6095,best Netflix documentary,I very much enjoyed I am a Killer and Eddie Hall Strongman
72103,best movies with a cool twist,That movie seems to get better every time I watch it.  Definitely one of my favorites
14786,best romantic novel,Emily Henry's new novel is even better than Beach Read!
2548,best headphones,NVX XPT100
5656,best programming language for web development,"By far JavaScript. You can do both front-end (fancy UI stuff in the browser) and back-end (getting data from databases, serving files to computers connecting to your website, etc.) with JS. Also note that front-end stuff will require you to learn HTML and CSS, but JS is the actual general-purpose language you'd use for programming logic (e.g. front-end: ""pressing this comment button will send the server all of the text I just typed"", and backend: ""I just received a new comment, better add it to the database"")."
49201,best gaming monitor,"Click the links until you find one that isn't deleted, the comment I replied to was similar. All spam accounts link farming bullshit ""top x"" sites with amazon affiliate links."
19431,best YouTube video,"kevin, if i could only watch one person on youtube, it would be you. :)"
57163,best water brand,"Yeah, maybe it's just old wives tale I hear everytime I work with DI water.  I guess it sounds true but probably isn't. Maybe you don't want to drink litres of DI everyday but maybe it's ok. ... So nevermind"
24584,best anime,"1. Detective Conan - Kinda way too long and 10 years past its prime but there's never been another anime series that's put out as much stuff that I enjoy to the degree I do with Conan. And never a series I've been obsessed with the way I was with it around 2008.

2. Haruhi - The anime that made me an anime fan beyond whatever I found on American tv. Absolutely blew my mind when I first watched it, is still utterly brilliant for much of its 2 season and a movie run (especially the movie).

3. One Piece - The other best long running anime. I love it for the same reasons everyone does, but I will say, I've done a terrible job of actually watching later parts of it. Regardless, it's still everything good about long running shonen.

4. Welcome to the NHK - The most genuine, horrifically real anime. Or at least the best in that genre for my tastes. And I love its use of comedy that is so sad and miserable it stops being fun and starts becoming sadder than any more serious series.

5. The World God Only Knows - The best harem series, by being way more than a harem series. So incredibly good at getting me emotionally invested that I honestly feel like it made me more emotionally invested in series I saw later. It had that big an impact on me."
13911,best research paper archive,same for me as it comes to sci-hub. just two clicks. I'm in heaven.
48390,best color to paint with,I would suggest a light grey or greige (grey-beige).  I think the blog Young House Love has a good post on grey shades.  nice space!

8201,best toothpaste,After lunch and after dinner...
38641,best newspapers to read,"my personal favourite section is 'Street of Shame': its basicly a collection of stories and rumours concerning the antics of various newpapers and their staff. usually pointing out hypocrisy, bad management etc.

'funny old world' is 3 newpaper stories from around the world which are just totally ridiculous - genuine, but silly as hell.

they do a really good job on reporting on certain issues. every week you will find a small section on pretty much everything - TV&Media, Arts, Agriculture, the NHS, local government, Trains, the City and many many others. its also pretty indepth stuff, sure its sometimes obscure and you might not really care about some of it, but atleast they are reporting it.

theres also a pretty large section in the middle which is essentially a parody of a tabloid that week.

i find it great toilet reading tbh. i would definately recommend it if you fancy a high brow laugh at the past couple of weeks happenings."
42370,movies like Inception,10 Cloverfield Lane had me guessing practically the whole time. Then the end is just beautiful.
30259,best Mexican war to study,"They honestly donâ€™t teach much about it. But the Alamo is definitely what set it off. Texas was independent, so if it wasnâ€™t for the Mexicans slaughtering Americans at the Alamo, the US wouldnâ€™t have gotten involved. And itâ€™s not like the Alamo was the first instance of Mexicans messing with Americans in Texas. The Mexicans would sell land to Americans that they knew was Comanche territory, wait for the Comanche to come in and kill all the Americans, then sell the land to more Americans. I honestly donâ€™t know anything about us fighting honorably or anything, but there was definitely a lot of reasons for anti-Mexican sentiment by the time the war started. Oh, and there was a lot of land that was super easy to take for our own."
34621,best NFL player,"Just for fun: Jerryâ€™s 36% coming from non HOF QBs equates to 557 receptions, Larryâ€™s 96% is 1374 receptions, and Mossâ€™ 81% comes out to 795 receptions."
