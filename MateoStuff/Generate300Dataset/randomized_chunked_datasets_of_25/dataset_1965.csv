Does this seem like good value? I‚Äôd be using it primarily for running an app or two and multiple chrome tabs, streaming, etc. 

If this seems good, would you recommend an extra 8gb RAM? I‚Äôve heard 16g is becoming the new standard for Windows 10. If so, what would an additional 8g stick typically cost, and how easy is install?

Thanks so much for making this!"
33984,best Pokemon game,"The ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go‚Äù games are designed for beginners to the series. They aren‚Äôt the most exciting games and don‚Äôt pose much of a challenge, but they‚Äôll teach you what you need to know and they‚Äôre highly interactive. 

The ‚ÄúSword and Shield‚Äù games are basically the modern take on the main Pok√©mon games. They‚Äôre good if you‚Äôre looking to see the latest and greatest Pok√©mon currently has out there. They‚Äôre more difficult than ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go‚Äù, but that isn‚Äôt saying much since ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go‚Äù is mostly very easy.

The ‚ÄúBrilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl‚Äù games are coming out in November, and they‚Äôre the most traditional Pok√©mon experience on the Switch. They stick most closely to the original Pok√©mon formula, which some people prefer for various reasons, whether it‚Äôs nostalgia or simply because the traditional games were much more mysterious. This will probably be the most challenging of the 3 listed here, but it‚Äôs definitely not ‚Äútoo difficult‚Äù by any means."

70790,best movies with a cool twist,"Didn't want to spoil but yes.

Changed the whole movie IMO - from a question to a definite answer.  Most other movies they would blatantly have said character make a dastardly smile over a shoulder or something to tell the audience how really they were bad.  I liked how this film didn't force feed it, hell, it barely let you know.  That and the changes the twist makes to the story are small yet definite."
