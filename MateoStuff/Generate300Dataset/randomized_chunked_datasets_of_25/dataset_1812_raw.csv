"Dolphin mostly because of the feature which allows you to open a terminal panel in the folder you are in. I use it all the time to do quick operations on file or git commands.

Three Words:  Remember the Alamo
Definitely the Riftwar Cycle series by Raymond E Feist! The world was originally created as an alternative to the D&D before being written into a book series and it's huge and fantastic.
