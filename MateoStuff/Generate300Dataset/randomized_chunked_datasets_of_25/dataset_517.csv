26685,"Well, I'd try to have at least one or two games in each of a few different categories:

- Party games: Time's Up and Codenames are both great, so is Catch Phrase.
- Games for new players: something really easy to teach the rules for, like 6 Nimmt / Category 5, Fairy Tale, Settlers of Catan
- ""We have all day"" games: things which take a while but are worth it, like Mage Knight, Eclipse, Too Many Bones, etc. You can plan an event around these.
- Crunchy engine builders: really there are a ton of these so just pick whatever the new hotness is. I really like Altiplano (Orleans is also great), Roads & Boats, anything by Uwe Rosenberg, anything with ""Key"" in the title.
- Cooperative games: Pandemic, Legendary: Encounters (any of them), Mechs vs. Minions, Robinson Crusoe, Big Book of Legends.
- Legacy / campaign games: if you have a set gaming group you might really like going through one of these. Gloomhaven, Pandemic Legacy, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Descent.
- Games for particular player counts: you probably want at least a couple little 2-player games, and if you like solitaire games at least one or two of those. Rose King, Onitama, that kind of thing.

Some of these obviously fit in multiple categories, like Mechs vs Minions is coop and campaign. Anyway that's my two cents! Have fun building your collection!",best board games

17732,"I’m surprised that everyone is saying Khloe who has bullied girls younger than her, e.g., Chloe Grace Mortez and Jordyn Woods as well as being Kim’s lackey and bullying Kourtney for not being comfortable sharing aspects of her life. Bare in mind it’s arguable that Kourtney has shared the most out of all of them.

Khloe uses the persona of KhloMoney and people find her relatable that way as well as because she was the ‘fat’ ‘ugly’ sister but really that doesn’t excuse her behaviour or the way she treats other women.

She is quite misogynistic to women especially those she seems threatened by and simps for men especially traschan so I honestly don’t see how she is the most moral.

Even in the earlier seasons people found her attitudes refreshing but I think that it just showed how negative she really was.

Also this is the same Khloe that said in later seasons that she faked her fertility issues when she was with Lamar as she didn’t want to have kids. Not exactly moral",best Kardashian
