"For me personally, I would definitely have to recommend Wild Wild Country for anyone who hasn’t watched it. Hands down one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen, and I’m still shocked all of this actually happened and I had no clue about it lol. 

It’s a limited series documentary on Netflix based on a controversial cult leader (Rajneesh ‘Osho’ Bagwan) who builds a utopian city in the Oregon desert, and shortly after conflict ensues with the locals and his followers which escalated into a national scandal. 

Found it to be extremely compelling, don’t want to say to much and ruin the gist of it but I highly recommend giving it a go if you haven’t already!"
I almost pissed myself laughing the first time I saw [this response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG8zNSf0c9k) to that video.

Or if you're asking about general non-torrent download sources for that content then you'll want to search/ask in /r/filesharing, /r/DigitalPiracy, or /r/Piracy."
"I mean.. axios is just js, right? It can't do anything you can't do with native js."
For real ^^. Where did it all go?
Best aspect ratio and resolution and refresh rate is 32:9 at 3840 X 1080 at 144Hz
I personally would appreciate it. I notice a significantly improved taste and visual clarity to my water after a pitcher filtration (extremely old municipal pipes)
"If you don't have access to, or can't afford vet care for exotics.  Do not get one. 

Or if you don't have access to ethical breeders or rescues for your exotics.  Don't get one.  Big box pet stores are not good places to get pets."
μm?
"No protection at all! Very few scratches, although Apple did replace it once (a year ago) because my battery had started to swell suddenly."
"Not small sadly it will be quite a bit bigger than your current phone(same size as the X). I’m also looking at upgrading as my battery is fairly bad and my screen is now cracked on my 7. My main frustration is that if you want a smaller phone, the only options really are 8 (which is also fairly old at this point), SE gen 2 or 12 mini."
"I have often had to defend my love of Kid Rock and his music to friends and co-workers who's best argument is ""he just looks so nasty and sleazy"". I often point to things he has done and said that seem to suggest that he is a down to earth , ""good"" person. I am glad a few people can share the sentiment and at least one redditor can attest to the fact."
I can see exactly 1 lake on this map.
"Curve, the number one cologne of people in my 2004 junior high."
Crystal Geyser is fine
"Fuckin up the count, my boy, Mexico, packages, and Forever and a day. Love Madlib+Freddie and I can't wait Bandana but I was scared Shadow was going to be our last Gibbs project for a loooong time."
Do you recommend mouthwash? My dental hygiene seems to have gone up after using it; less plaque on my teeth.
"Thanks! For some reason, stochastic processes tend to sound incredibly bad ass. My other favorite is 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo'."
"Yeah ok will have a look. G pro wireless goes on sale occasionally so I'll try that but viper ultimate is newer and I haven't seen it go down, otherwise I would go for that. I'll check out the g305 as well, thanks for the tips"
Yeah deffo go during cooler months. It won't disappoint.
Illmatic by a long shot.
"How many missions is jaws of the lion and how representative is it of the full versions of the game?

I'm interested in buying it to play with my girlfriend to test the waters for frosthaven but wondering if you could give some insight"
"Contact (1997, Jodie Foster)"
"We thought about it, but my father in law wants to be at ""the beach, in sun"" with his grandchildren. He's of the mindset that he wants to pay for everything up front, with known costs. Old-fashioned, maybe...."
