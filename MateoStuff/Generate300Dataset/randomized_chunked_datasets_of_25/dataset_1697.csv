37075,"I echo the Cedar Point vote is you are up for a road trip.

If not, Busch Gardens Williamsburg is the way to go.  They have a really good collection of roller coasters and the park itself is one of the most beautiful parks in the country.

Hersheypark would be a close second for me.  They have a lot deeper collection of roller coasters but to me, they lack the top end quality that BGW has.  They have the quantity though.  They have 7 really good coasters.   It is also a really nice park, but not on the level of BGW.  Throw in the zoo that is attached, and Hersheypark is one of the few parks I could do more than a day at without getting bored.",best amusement park
