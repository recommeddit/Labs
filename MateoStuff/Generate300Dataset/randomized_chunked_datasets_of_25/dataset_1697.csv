65061,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Dune Coffee Roasters (French Press' new name), Caje, or Low Pigeon are all great."
67817,axios alternatives reddit,It's mostly preference. Some folks like the API of Axios more. Both get the job done for most use cases.
61335,Best RPG game on PS4,I disagree. My mouse broke when i was on my first playthough. I had no choice other than to use controller. And i never felt crippled playing it with a controller. It actually felt smoother
37075,best amusement park,"I echo the Cedar Point vote is you are up for a road trip.

If not, Busch Gardens Williamsburg is the way to go.  They have a really good collection of roller coasters and the park itself is one of the most beautiful parks in the country.

Hersheypark would be a close second for me.  They have a lot deeper collection of roller coasters but to me, they lack the top end quality that BGW has.  They have the quantity though.  They have 7 really good coasters.   It is also a really nice park, but not on the level of BGW.  Throw in the zoo that is attached, and Hersheypark is one of the few parks I could do more than a day at without getting bored."
46513,best trick or treating candy,The vote was split between right Twix and left Twix.
60759,Best comedy show on Netflix,"To Burr and Segura, I would also add Segura's wife Christina P.

Edit: everyone already said those."
11181,best backpack for college,"I have had a Jansport Airlift since 1999 and I still use it to this day for hauling gear (skating pads, rock climbing gear, day camping).

It even has rubbery, cell-walled material in the shoulder straps that I was convinced would tear apart with repeated use but the shoulder straps are still in amazing condition."
59976,best perfume,"I bought a 50 ml tester for $7 and I couldn't resist. It smells much more expensive than it is, but the sharp lime opening can be a little off-putting. Loveee the dry down tho"
33842,best Pokemon game,Which ones do you think is best? BC that's still alot of games to choose from. Want to see if I can narrow it down a little more. Might play all of them at some point I just don't know where to start.

39116,best web browser,They are basically the same piece of software but with a few random changes so I would not be surprised in the least if resource utilization is not entirely consistent between machines.
5476,best home improvement store,"Sullivan Hardware is pricey but if you need to go in a store where the staff is actually helpful they’re pretty great.

The one where you have to get to the train station in 1:15, without a scratch, in random traffic, was particularly brutal. But man when Dieter said there’d be something extra in my cheque, all worth it somehow."
