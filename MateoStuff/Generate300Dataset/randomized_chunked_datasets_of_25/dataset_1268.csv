54029,best medicine for a cold,I went to boot camp in the middle of a very cold Chicago winter. I was sick the entire time up until the last two weeks after we went through the gas chamber. I had enough snot and gunk to fill a bowl.
25358,best spiderman actor,"Well, apparently not just ""handsome"" if his look was the first thing Gwen (who was depicted as the ""beauty queen"") noticed about him.   
Tobey isn't ugly, but he looks too ""simple"" for Peter Parker. And Tom is fine, but if you ask me who does the classic Peter resembles the most, the answer definitely is Garfield IMO  [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfCAHeRUEAEYsL0?format=jpg&name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfCAHeRUEAEYsL0?format=jpg&name=small)

They may not look completely alike, obviously, but he certainly closer than the others.   
So yeah, Peter is suppose to have a really good look, hence why all his troubles with the girls are not because of them not finding him attractive but because of his hero job. And a ""model face"" as you called him, feels exactly right, if you ask me.

And also, TNAS Spider-Man looks like Garfield as well lol.

&#x200B;

And how's she not? She has no personal traits, she's bland, her backstory wasn't explored, her relatioship with Peter weren't explored that much as well, we don't know what Peter even liked her for other than for her looks, not to mention she played the role of a damsel in distress 3 times in the first movie alone."
759,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,"As much of a joke as it sounds, I really do have uneven biceps. One arm is totally toned and the other is but a noodle."
8681,best toothpaste,"Yeah,  I've changed my opinion on the baking soda price thing.  Several other commenters suggested that the premise of ""many poor people across generations have told me that baking soda is substantially cheaper"" as potentially being a generational myth that gets passed down from parent to child and eventually,  that just becomes a thing they believe. So yeah,  I'm wrong on this one."
22357,best celebrity,"Ha! Actually I remember he had a very inexpensive, almost cheap looking, cardigan sweater on.  Had it been anyone other than John Candy, I don't think anyone would have paid this man any mind at all."
6506,best Netflix documentary,I really didn’t even expect to watch this one. I was about 10 minutes in oddly enough I was hooked. Jiro’s story is definitely an incredible one lol.
49484,best gaming monitor,"I think its a great monitor, tho its way cheaper in the US, but if its the cheapest option than yeah go for it as long as its the XF270HUA model."
19075,best YouTube video,Hello my name’s Ninnnnnnoooooooo!
25049,best spiderman actor,Tobey was the first man I saw who got bitches by being sensitive. I’m not stopping until I get his technique down.

61121,Best comedy show on Netflix,Death note.
53586,best medicine for a cold,"I would use those sick days! Bronchitis is pretty bad and it's transmitted by inhaling cough droplets, so be sure to cough on all your coworkers!"
5082,best home improvement store,"Home Depot is the epitome of ""not my department, go see that guy"".

It once took me 2.5 hours for them to find my a tools chest that they said they had 5 in stock of. I eventually left and ordered it online to pick up in store. I got an email the next day saying it was ready for pick up. I arrive and nobody has a clue what's going on. Repeat day 1. I cancelled order, called customer service to get original order refunded and then requested that it be shipped to my house free of charge. The product came in two boxes. Only one box was shipped. They didn't believe me that only one box shipped and ask that I take a picture to verify only one box showed up. I was just like ""how can I take a picture of a box that doesn't exist?"". They told me they would send the second box. Guess what showed up 3 days later? Two boxes or the original product. I called and they wanted me to pay for shipping to send the item back, not a chance, get me a return label. They did, I send it back and then get a phone call that I only returned part of an item and that my credit card will be charged if the entire item isn't recieved.

I now shop at Rona."
45360,best gaming system,"I've been on Xbox since the first one, i also had the very first playstation and the first nintendo. For online games i go to xbox, for single player games i usually play on ps4 and i dont have a switch yet. 

So it varies depending on what im feeling like.

Really? You ask a question and when you dont like the answer you downvote? Really?"
38154,best Marvel movie,"How many do you want to watch? If you only want to watch one I think Iron Man, Guardians of Galaxy, and Ant-Man work best as stand-alone films. Not to say they are the best films. 

If you want to just want to watch the good ones: Captian America Winter Soldier, Iron Man,  Captin America First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Guardians of Galaxy (1 &2), Ant-Man (1 & 2), The Avengers and Black Panther.  Everything else is ok to bad in my humble opinion."
13895,best research paper archive,"I am a scientist, and I normally would not read papers using the method described in the articles you posted. If a nootropic's effectiveness is so speculative that it depends on the exact conditions of one experiment, I don't think it should be recommended. Even totally correct papers vary in their results. Reading just one paper is a classic failure mode that I think you should warn against more heavily, e.g. http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/

Assuming you have a limited time for reading, it's safer to read broadly instead of deeply. Review articles are good for this, but that failing, you can just read several papers from different labs. For a typical nootropics paper, I think the abstract will often be all you need: the dose, time, number of patients, and the results. The only reason to dig deeper than this is if the abstract is incomplete (sadly common) or if you are going to draw precise conclusions from one study, which you shouldn't do anyway."
49430,best gaming monitor,Curious why you're getting a Xbox if you already have a gaming PC
7653,best laptop for general use,Budget under $700
1793,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I second this, Gios on upper state is the best in town and the one in Isla Vista isn't bad either"

63409,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,It’s in the list
53438,best usb c charging cable,"That was some unbranded crap for 2$. I have a very good experience with Ugreen so far, I ordered 3 usb c to lightning cables from them today, hopefully they will not burn down my house"
24502,best anime,"No prob! I'd also recommend watching the opening of the first movie because it wasn't part of the show as well as the part of the first movie that covers post-episode 8/9 stuff because it's handled *entirely* differently compared to the show and it's more awesome at times, even if you don't want to watch the *entirety* of the first movie before you watch the second one. The second one changes around enough that it needs to be watched in full to not accidentally miss something they changed or added."
61021,Best comedy show on Netflix,Don't bingewatch this show. It's a treasure. So well written.
58050,best cologne,Third!
