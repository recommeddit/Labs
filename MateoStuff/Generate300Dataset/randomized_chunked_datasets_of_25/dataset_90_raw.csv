"I love Josh Allen, and his improvement as a passer has been a revelation. But if he doesn't change his running style, he's going to get injured trucking somebody. 

Find me a mobile quarterback, and I will find you 10,000 of his anonymous online supporters who will defend him by saying, ""He's not like the others! He's smarter! He's more agile! He's different!"" But he's not, and Allen is too good of a passer to be laying out linebackers head-on."

"French door refrigerators have more space but also come with more issues 

Side by side refrigerators are a little more reliable in the long run.  

I work in the sales and service industry for appliances. 

Most units of any brand have a life expectancy of about 5 years before something major fails, my experience has seen most of the avoid brands I mentioned failed at a higher rate and earlier than expected."
"Did some simple tests at a couple apis that I use that responds with json. 

On average (50 runs each at 3 different endpoints):

node-fetch: 80.707ms (for const data = await fetch(...)  
node-fetch: 85.985ms (total time including parsing data.res to json)  
axios: 16.394ms (for await axios.get(url))

As much as I hate to learn that axios is not maintained properly, I really cant afford a 5x increase in speed. 

Would love to know what others have experienced regarding to speed/efficiency."

"Not a lot new to contribute as far as styles go (seconding a lot of the advice here!) but make sure you give your cell phone screen a look with the glasses on before you buy -- sometimes the polarized coating on the lenses can make some screens really touch to see. I have Polaroid sunglasses I occasionally wear, and my Samsung phone's screen is hard to see.

Edit: missed two useful words >_<"

"The starters in Gen 1 were your difficulty selection.  It's kind of ingenious, actually.

* Bulbasaur was ""Easy"" because you have type advantage in gyms 1 and 2, and neutral until gym 5 (Sabrina)
* Squirtle was ""Medium"" because you still had type advantage in gym 1, but were neutral in 2 and weak in 3
* Charmander was ""Hard"" because you had disadvantage in gym 1 and 2, and got your first advantage in gym 4 (Erica)

Since then, however, they decided to keep with Fire/Grass/Water as the ""tutorial"" on type weaknesses instead of focusing on the best types to modify difficulty level.  It's still there just by nature of how many type advantages and disadvantages there were, but it was never tuned quite like Gen 1"
