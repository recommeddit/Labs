62792,Best Data Science textbook,"Answers to such questions depend on background. However, for and from the statistics community (as opposed to signal processing, control, or cs) maybe try:

Simon Wood - Core Statistics

It kinda starts from scratch on one hand (tells you what hypothesis test is), yet follows a rapid exposition into regression with MLE and with optimization, then with formulating simple hierarchical models and Gibbs and MCMC samplers. Most remarkably, it shows you R code to support all of that trhoughout all chapters. It ends with GLMs. It's dense, but it has a point of going from scratch->through derivation->to code.

The author is a well published data analyst for the academic sciences, if that helps you as an endorsement."

44658,best items under $100,After trying so many techniques to clear my skin I finally realized that my skin is super sensitive and can’t handle any rubbing or cleansers. Just a good diet and VERY light cleansing and then complex 15 cream. In hindsight I should have realized this was obvious but I was so sold on cleansing routines for so long I got caught up in the marketing. The cleansers were harsh on my skin and my skin would compensate by producing more oil. After a few rough weeks getting off the cleanser routine my skin calmed right down.
33264,best electric car,"An important benefit is to be able to use the battery in your car to power your home during an extended power outage, or at least keep your refrigerator and a few other things running. Traditionally that required a noisy and polluting gas generator, which not everyone has and requires maintenance. Or you can spend many thousands of dollars for a ""whole house battery,"" but why do that when your car has a much bigger battery in it? 

Depending how much energy you use, today's EVs could easily run a whole house for a couple of days, or longer if you cut your consumption."
51163,best rap album,"I'm actually really surprised that they didn't put the Gorillaz there.  Not because they deserve it - I love them, but it's a big world and I'm sure there are 500 better albums - but it seems like the sort of thing NME would faun over."

69977,best major to study in college,"I did this and I'm currently a 4th yr med student applying to residency in head and neck surgery. This is definitely not the smartest route if you are set on medical school. I thought it was great for me but it is challenging to maintain the 3.7+ gpa you need in undergrad in engineering courses to get into med school.  There are much 'easier' routes to med school but if you're interested in research (md/phd) or device development or want to have a more solid understanding of science than a straight bio major then it is a good choice. PM me if you have specific q's

EDIT: Getting a lot of PMs about my statement regarding 'easier routes'. To clarify, I meant other majors that involve much less work than engineering to achieve the same GPA output. Eg, in engineering I would often spend 15-20+ hours on a single problem set or engineering report for a class that requires 10 or so during a quarter, combined with taking 3-4 other classes. To get an A you have to do well on all of these assignments as well as doing well on the midterm/final, but you find that you get less time to just straight up study when you're spending all your time getting your damn MATLAB code working/completing hours of assignments etc. Spending all your time to do well in engineering means you have less time to do other activities that med school admissions committees value including volunteering, research (I still did a lot of this - but then you sleep less), going abroad etc. 
To me, some of these easier majors may be Biology, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and other non-science majors as long as you fill out the med school pre-reqs.
Overall though I think it is best to pursue your 'passion' - something that you can study for hours and not get bored, which for me was was BME/engineering. When you study something like that, you can do really well with less effort and you end up enjoying it more. The hard part is finding this area. That is something no one can tell you and requires some soul-searching. Hope this helps ... I agree with what MDfootball2014 wrote below"

56516,best desktop monitor,"It’s currently on sale at best buy for $380 actually. The 24” version was on sale at least last night for $350 on newegg. Keep in mind for the 27” you want the A07 or newer (preferably A09) revision to minimize the color branding issues this monitor had on the older revisions. I don’t know what revisions the 24” version is on currently but last I heard there was at least an A05 version.
