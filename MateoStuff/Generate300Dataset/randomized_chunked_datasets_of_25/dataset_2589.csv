32487,best vacation resort,"Exactly; pay attention to the negative reviews, that's what you notice more when you're there.

Also, take note of what the negative reviews are complaining about, and see if there's any patterns. If a place has 5 negative reviews, 1 complaining about the poor hot water system and 4 complaining about the cleanliness of the rooms, it's pretty safe to say that the hot water system was a one off issue, while the room cleaning is likely to be a reoccurring issue."

23548,best car racing video game,"It runs horribly on PC for some people - I have it from EA Play on Steam and couldn’t get consistently above 30, never-mind 60, on any settings.
(RTX 2060 Super, Ryzen 5 3600 (6 cores at 3.5GHz))

Edit: why am I being downvoted when I’m saying that the game is badly optimised?

Edit 2: clarification - it runs badly for some people and fine for others, seems to be random luck. To everyone saying it’s only me, it definitely isn’t, as a Google search would show you."

37927,best Marvel movie,"I keep thinking there's no way they can top the current movie (Civil War, Ragnarok, Black Panther, Infinity War, Endgame), and then they keep topping the movie. I almost have to lower my expectations after Endgame, though."

4918,best home improvement store,"Dunn Lumber for quality wood. Ace for small items I need right away since it's closest to me and locally owned-ish. HD for whenever I want more options, plus it's generally cheaper the the two mentioned before. Lowe's if they have a specific on sale or the HD is too busy. Harbor Freight for super simple tools for the lowest price available."

51914,best iphone case,"I’ve always preferred the Apple leather cases. Less grippy than silicone but not too slick, and they look nice. I have the sequoia green and it is very dark. Under artificial light, it can appear almost dark grey, and pairs nicely with the Silver finish. But the 13 Pro is pretty chunky and, despite the big bump, the case kind of keeps the wobbles under control."
6448,best Netflix documentary,"Me too. I have seen this film about 1,000 times while browsing Nwetflix. I think maybe because the cover art is so eye catching. I've heard good things about it, and like the previous poster said, I have no interest in Formula One (or any racing) however, I have been pleasantly surprised more than once by a doc that I thought I would have no interest in.

I do believe I will watch it soon..."
