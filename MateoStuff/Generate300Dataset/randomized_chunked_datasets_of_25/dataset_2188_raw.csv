"So this won't be seen by more than a fraction of who it is intended for, but I'd like to thank every single one of you who commented. It really helped me make my decision and I just ordered the LG monitor. Honestly it could have gone either way."
"Best album so far for me is a tie with:

Armand Hammer & The Alchemist - Haram- Two powerhouse lyricists spitting powerful bars over sublime beats from The Alchemist (that album art... wow).

Czarface and MF DOOM- Super What?- Three dominant MCs bring their A-game alongside  amazing production by 7L. The playfulness of the comic book theme combined with Eso's powerful performance and DOOM's high lyrical content level result in a fantastic album. Though the final track pulls the project down as a whole."
M.E. here. Got into technical sales and manage a sales tram across the Americas. Fully location agnostic. It is all in how you slice it.
Cuz I am right so I gots to win
TIL I've been accidentally making blind Russians.

"Anything in IT probably, IT is just booming and will only get bigger"
"Cisa is pretty much the standard, yes. It’s very straightforward, buy the book, take the exam, and pay annually to keep the certification plus some continued education points you need to keep. It has been many years since I renewed mine, as I’m no longer in that line of work, but it gives you a strong foot when it comes to understanding risks, controls and what ‘good’ looks like"
Walter Payton.  Jim Brown and Barry Sanders rolled into one
"I'd recommend grammarly. It's better for insight on your writing styles than anything. Study up on AP style writing, and you'll learn the basics of grammar. It's not as complicated once you get plenty of practice in."
Definitely this series. The Samuil Petrovich Series by Simon Morden is similar Action.
Thank you for suggesting these!
I like Tim Ferriss's list of [cold remedies](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/03/18/4-anti-cold-cocktails-that-work-from-ancient-china-to-german-alcoholics-and-modern-labs/). The ginger and orange peel remedy is the one that seems to always work for me.
"Just a note, all the UCs are considered Public Ivy except Merced I think."
"I don't recommend blind buying, but Perry Ellis 360 Red is probably one of the safest blind buys in that price range. If you like Acqua di Gio, you'll like it. Even if you don't, you still might like 360 Red."
"Its pretty nice.. Its pretty handy not having to refresh the page, Im just so used to my other options its tough to switch."
"From what I've been told and read, those floss sticks should be for out and about and convenience. Using them to floss regularly just kinda spreads bacteria around, unless you use a new one every few teeth."
"King Richard the Lion Heart. He despised Britain, loved killing people and was a shit soldier who pretty much bankrupted his country by getting caught on his way home from the brutal crusades and having to be ransomed out."
Spotify has audiobooks actually.
"Someone may have already said this, but overnight oats!
I bought a bunch of mason jars and I put in some oats, some yogurts/milk and some fruit in them, then just grab on my way out of the house."
"Sounds great! I make the gravy the way I was taught (southerner here), but your technique looks sound...will have to try :) thanks! 

Oh and sometimes I add in green chile to cook with the sausage for a southwestern flair ;)"
"I find most sci-fi, and maybe especially the works of Peter F. Hamilton to do this for me, probably because he spends so much time (and words) on worldbuilding, Just the beautifully realized worlds really lets me experience the places where adventure happens so nicely."
"I've gotten through AP Calc AB, Calc 1, Calc 2, Differential Equations, and am working through Calc 3 and Statistics with a TI-84CE. The NSpire is banned on a lot of tests in my classes due to CAS, so I know people who more or less wasted money and can't use their calculators. The TI-84 series is great and will pack enough to get you through most math classes.

However, my university also prohibits use of calculators on some tests to only a 4 function all the way through Calc 3, so you may not also use it that much."
"I wore Cooper Square by Bond No. 9 to work one day and a coworker told me that her uterus almost leapt out of her body and strangled me.

My girlfriend damn near raped me when I put on Scent of Peace for Men by the same parfumier,"
