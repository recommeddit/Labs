32657,best vacation resort,"My wife and I went to dreams Los Cabos for our honeymoon and we can't wait to go back for another vacation. It was fantastic!

32363,best hotel to live in,"I found while working in one of the higher end hotels in my city that the really famous people don't want attention. At all. They don't want room service, or staff hanging around. Even the welcoming group of the GM and friends is a bit much, just go away and let them be alone. 9/10 times you would just hear video games or a movie from the room. They just want their alone time.

It's the D list celebs who know damn well they're not all that, that demand the attention. Likely to prove to themselves that see, they are important.

And dont even start on people whose biggest claim to fame involves ""twitter"", ""Instagram"" or ""influencer"". God damn parasites who expect to be treated like billionaires but not cough up a single cent."

17497,best iOS game,"Fact that nobody mentioned Brawl-Stars is crazy. 

Best F2P game i've played in forever, been playing for about 2 years now give or take, spent about $30-$50 over those two years and own literally everything in the game now.

I never grinded, just played a bit everyday or once in a while, sometimes i'll take weeks off before I play again.

All in all, for a F2P gacha arena fighting game, it really doesn't feel cash grabby at all whatsoever. As a person with a very disposable income, I feel basically zero need to spend money in the game unless theres a skin I want."

Dick Francis novels often this theme."
