"That's fair, I've never stayed above a Cat V and my complaint is probably more one of preference than quality (I'm just not a resorty kinda guy). I did feel like that Costa Rican resort was just there so entitled business travels could burn their extra points on a beach vacation (i.e. they were going to get the customers either way, so why try too hard)."
"Well, the 1080i mode definitely looked better on my 720p TV, yes, there was some film grain, but it was way sharper."
Cold leftover pizza.
His speech after the MLK assassination is probably his most iconic moment.
"No experience with Django personally, but as for /u/aramboyajyan's advice on MEAN, I agree that I'm not sure what his main complaint is. Mongo is perfectly suitable for what it seems like you're looking to do, plus it's more intuitive (in my opinion) than SQL. However, I will also admit that I personally have more experience with LAMP than MEAN. I am merely passing on the suggestions that I've heard from colleagues."

"I‚Äôve been using the turbo since November and I am actually retiring them now, since they got to the point where my calves get  pretty sore when I wear them, they lasted me around 600 km. Anyways, what I wanted to tell you is that my experience with the Turbo 2 is that you need some time to get used to them and  find the best way to lace them up. The upper on the heel is minimal and there is no support.  All in all, I loved how responsive the Turbo is and I even hit some PR‚Äôs on them. The turbo is great but it has a learning curve for sure."
"What was the cut-off criteria? I don't see Virat Kohli here. According to this page, he has captained for 52 matches and has >70 win percentage."
"I would be wary of getting anoles, because even though they are the cheapest lizard, they do require UVB lighting and heat, and they only eat live insects. Also, most of them are wild caught and prone to carry diseases."
Arrival
I‚Äôm partial to Irish mules! Jameson instead of vodka üëç
Very cool.
"This is my approach. I find that ""sleeping"" on my work allows me to wake up with a renewed pair of eyes and catch things I wouldn't have caught after a full day of writing. Works out great!"
Deal
"That is a reasonable possibility, but as of now, SEMC devs are trying to keep it free for everyone."
do i have to buy one from a vegan???
Haha I think that I'm biased because Kourtney is my favorite sister üòπüôà
"Listening to it again now, still pissed at the guy who pointed out the beeping noise in The Watcher a couple months ago."
Plus either ConEmu or Cmder come with enhanced far support built-in.
$30 rice cooker on sale from amazon. Chinese takeout quality rice every time. It even steams veg and fish!!
"Get civilization revolution, Skyrim, and Borderlands 1 and 2. Great games.  They should be really cheap right now."
"Thoughts and Prayers - Anthony Jeselnik

Not family friendly at all.  It might be the most offensive stand up I've seen in a long time.   But it's funny because it's clever.   His delivery and timing are impressive."
"Nfs 4 and 5. 

4 is the perfect Nfs arcade game, loads of tracks (all of nfs3 and the new from 4), cool music and game modes, could use some more cars, though.

5 is less arcadey, less round courses, more rallye-like start-finish tracks, most of them great, dozens of Porsches, awesome content."
Wait what
"I'm not sure if this is a stupid question because I didn't watch football when he was playing, but why is Michael Strahan not more highly regarded? He's top 10 all time in sacks and has the single season record, but he was 99 on the NFL's list and not ranked on the Athletic's? Why is he not treated as one of the great defenders?"
