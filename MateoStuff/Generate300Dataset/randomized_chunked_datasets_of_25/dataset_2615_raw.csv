"I’d be interested to know where everyone is located and see if there is a difference based on location as well. 

I still get a ton of grey, but it is transitioning to off whites, creams, and whites. 

I’m in central Canada."
"I agree, it's a really great book that I recommend even to people who don't know R."
Haha. That makes a lot more sense
"I recommend expanding your taste in music. hip hop is good, and there is SOME stuff bumping enough to trance you during workouts, but it's mostly leisure music, like stuff you roll down the street bumping or do homework to. 

Every type of music has its place

If you really prefer hip hop tho, I recommend Eminem, Jay rock, skepta, big Sean, or any hype rapper like that.

But the energy sustain effects aren't gonna be as good as it would if you bumped heavy metal or something, so don't expect that.

But it doesn't really matter if you donors slow paced stuff."
"This and The Vietnam war and The War. All by Ken Burns. Music is phenomenal. Downloaded The Civil War album. The Ashokan Farewell will bring tears to your eyes.
Try to combine The War with “Supernova in the East” in the podcast series Hardcore History by Dan Carlin."
"This was INCREDIBLE, thank you so much!"
at 3m post partum though - clothes can be really depressing....depends on if she's back to her size or not. Last thing I would want is nice clothes in my 3m post partum size...
"hmmm, So far...

Best:  Rockatar Pure Zero Tagerine Mango Guava Strawberry (YES thats one flavor lol)

Watermelon Red bull is a very close second best.

Worst: original Monster or Most Bang energy drinks (has a bad aftertase)"
"Your opinion of Illmatic is boring and ridiculous.

It's 10 songs at just under 40 minutes how the fuck can that album be boring.  It's perfectly sequenced, lyrics are flawless along with the production. You make no sense."
"I really like the Amp Lemonade... probably the most delicious energy drink i've tried so far... Also, the Xyience (sp?) energy drinks are really good as well, green apple, mango, razz, and blueberry-guava i think..."
"• SNES: Link to the Past
• GBA: Pokemon Emerald 
• XBOX: Halo 2 
• PS3: Far Cry 3 ( Not exclusive, but I went for the one with most playtime)
• 3DS: Link Between Worlds"
"No wolves, but coydogs. Lots and lots of coydogs. Also lots of bear activity this year."
English tax is inflating the english team’s value. French team should take the top spot imo.
Will do! Added to my list. Thanks for the rec :)
Obc4l will for ever go down as the best Wu album ever
"Hi, for a simple general use device, I'd go with the Acer Aspire 5 on my list. Ryzen 5500U, 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS display for $569.99."
"""March of the Pigs"" is also excellent, particularly the extended version."
upboat for Dr. Octagon!
Fecal matter
"The thing I don’t like about BlueHost is that they will increase your monthly fee after a year without warning you! You can buy their package at a discount but what you don’t realise is that once the year is up, the price increases dramatically - for the same service?"
$2 - $3 a piece.
If you want a game that is also ridiculously easy for a beginner then I recommend Let's Go Pikachu And Eevee. But if you want something more challenging then it is Black And White as many have recommended here.
"Scotch.

My dad loves scotch, so we get him a bottle of stuff he's never tried before."
"I prefer au coeur du desert over LADM, but pretty decent scents overall. Xerjoff Naxos is really good"
"Actually that one is the 2nd book, the first book is Introduction to Statistical Learning which is a pretty good book for beginners."
