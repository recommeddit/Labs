Even then, it won’t kill all the bacteria in your mouth because there are so many nooks and crannies that will protect whatever bacteria are lodged there."

28638,best breakfast foods,"So sad that nobody from Turkey has commented yet, because Turkish breakfasts are the business. When I was living there, we'd have fresh simit (sesame-covered crusty hoop-shaped bread) hoisted up to our apartment brought to us by the kid from the bakery down the street, sour cherry and/or strawberry preserves, beyaz peynir (delicious salty white feta-ish cheese), kasar cheese (a less crumbly cheese - I think it's called Kashkaval elsewhere?), honey, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, spicy fried sausages, peppers, and lots of lovely tea. Last time I went to Istanbul I found a place that specializes in Anatolian-style breakfasts and went with a friend - I'm pretty sure their kaymak and honey (kind of like clotted cream but thicker and smoother at the same time) should be classified as a controlled substance. I've also had menemen for breakfast (kind of like an omelet, but less solid and a lot spicier - much like migas without the tortillas) and it's delicious, but I prefer it for lunch.

Turkish breakfast, I love you. Actually, no, Turkish *everything*, I love you."

4810,best home improvement store,"I usually go to Home Depot, because it is much, much, much more conveniently located for me.

But if it is for something small or something that I need advice or have questions regarding, I go to our local Ace Hardware. It's just a couple blocks away so I can walk our dog there and she can visit with the dogs that ""live"" in the store.  The staff, even the young highschool kids, are all 10X more knowledgeable than anyone I have encountered at home depot or Lowes, and as such have helped me work through some issues, mostly plumbing problems related to our old house. 

It is really beneficial being a local neighborhood shop, as they see customers who mostly have the same era and style of homes, so their knowledge is quite applicable usually.

I say go to whichever is more convenient for you or has a better deal, and then start going to your local hardware store for as much as you can. Big orange and big blue don't really appreciate your dollars like an Ace Hardware or other franchise/local operation will."
