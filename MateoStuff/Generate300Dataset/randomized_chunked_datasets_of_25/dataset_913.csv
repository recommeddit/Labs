9103,best toothpaste,"My mom has been a dental hygienist for over three decades, and she told me they're pretty much all the same (provided they contain fluoride). One exception is if you have sensitivity- then you should use Sensodyne."
32489,best vacation resort,"There are fake negative reviews too. The shilling industry is not new. Repeated, fake, negative reviews also exist and are often used to sink new businesses before they can take customers from somewhere else. 

There is no magic solution for sorting out real and fake reviews, but looking for places with more reviews lessens the impact of shilling. So does comparing reviews from different places."
66973,best soccer team in the world,"Sorry, they were the best."
56651,best desktop monitor,"While I did ""forget"" to include it or even mention it for that matter, I really don't feel it is necessary or even worth mentioning for what this guide is trying to accomplish. This is a buying guide for someone who has limited knowledge about all the different monitor features. What you mentioned is a niche feature that someone looking for a monitor to play some games on won't care about. If you know about Nvidia's 3D Vision Tech, then chances are this guide isn't meant for you."
27317,best stocks to buy,"+1 for SOFI. Rough past couple months but competitive company with solid user base and an audience that sets them apart from the stodgy old banks. Once they get their bank charter, heck yeah."
73156,best Linux distro,"The aur is my reason. Anything I've found for bsd or git packages or Debian packages are Lal there ready to use. 

To me it seems like doing any one thing is 20% more difficult than on it's ""best"" distro, but I've yet to find something that doesn't work at all. On Ubuntu/mint or Alpine I've ran into basically unsolvable problems."
5312,best home improvement store,Buying kitchen items from restaurant supply stores. They are MUCH better quality and insanely cheap!!!
27607,best bollywood actor,I think he is very goodlooking but he's too bland and arrogant which makes him unrelatable and intimidating
59529,best perfume,Are you psychic ðŸ˜³! Described me to a T! I think Iâ€™m pretty creative ðŸ¤” but I donâ€™t work in fashion. Pharmacist :) but on a break hehe ðŸ˜…
17941,best Kardashian,"1. Kourtney
2. Kim 
3. Everyone else sucks 

A few years ago Khloe was my favorite and I couldnâ€™t stand Kim lol how times have changed."
56605,best desktop monitor,Anyone know how to look for the best monitor for watching dark videos like movies or tv.
54729,best water filter,Yeah I thought it was weird it makes the water start tasting sour or something after the filter was past its life. Until then the water tastes amazing.

There are always general public torrent indexers you can check out. See the Common Post Topics in the sidebar, e.g.

There are also private torrent trackers specialized in that content. You'll want to search through /r/Trackers for more info on those.

Or if you're asking about general non-torrent download sources for that content then you'll want to search/ask in /r/DigitalPiracy, or /r/Piracy.

22745,best celebrity,"i love this cause if it's a random guy that wants to be in the wedding photos, fuck him. but tom hanks in a polo shirt and yankees cap, by all means"
21130,best workout music,"Not a fan of moshing, but this sounds like my type of cardio!"
13860,best research paper archive,"I love ""the selfish gene"", and had no idea it was available online! Thanks :)"
13962,best research paper archive,"It's just the culture. Most of the major breakthroughs came from conference papers and everyone wants to publish at the top conferences. For example, want to publish ML stuff, NeurIPS and ICML are the most prestigious venues. Distributed systems or operating systems? Publish at OSDI or SOSP. Security? USENIX security is where you want to publish.

There are probably some other historical reasons as to why conferences are more prestigious, but one of the reasons is because papers are smaller. Often no one will read a 40  page long journal entry, when a 14 page conference paper suffices. Also, not wanting to sound accusatory, but are you in the research community? Because it's definitely not true that journals are harder to get accepted or have more impact. Not that there aren't good journal papers, but the community definitely cares way more about conferences."
43425,best ad service for mobile applications,"Adcolony, Amazon, Admob

34440,best NFL player,"You're wrong. Period. For the hundredth time; the lack of iconic plays is not a knock on Brady, it's totally circumstantial. But perception is reality for a lot of people and Joe Cool has the more famous moments. Period. Go watch an NFL films movie or something. Me being a 49ers fan has nothing to do with the the thousands of times I've seen Montana's plays. The only ones from Brady that I see are the tuck, field goals, and interceptions. Get over it, get your head out of the sand and stop trying to argue a dumb thing to argue about. The Catch > The Tuck, period, end of story, no debate, go home and get over it. Stop crying about someone saying Brady is as good as Montana but that a lot of people (not me) wont agree due to Montana's iconic moments and never losing or throwing a so much as an interception in the Super Bowl. You done yet?  I'm tired of explaining how this works for someone who has no knowledge of NFL history, or is completely unaware of how a lot of people dislike Brady and will never put him over Montana. This stupid argument you're having with yourself while ignoring the context of what I'm saying is over."
