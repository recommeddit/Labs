I know some people rag on it but I really thought Solo was a fun adventure story. It's sci fi adventure but the spirit is still there.

Agree but also look for used c920s on fb marketplace or OfferUp before you buy a cheaper one. Got my second one for $25

"It was a cool twist, but later all I could think about was that I'd be able to tell if he was alive. I know the, ""that's the whole point, you wouldn't"" argument. I just can't help it."
"I was sure Chocolate Peanut-Butter would be here and upvoted up the wazoo.... but I don't see it at all...

Especially from Baskin Robbins with the Peanut-Butter ribbon.... oh, that peanut-butter ribbon....."
I just do some oatmeal with some sweatener and cinnamon .  50 hours isn't too bad unless you are underselling so you should have time
Good additions!
Of course it's racist. It's racism under the veil of freedom of association. One person's rights end when they infringe on another's rights. It's like not allowing African Americans to not eat in your private establishment restaurant.

"I agree the AT&T plan is one of the best [cheap cell phone plans](https://dailygizmo.net/cheap-cell-phone-plans/) it is sort of like one of those limited/unlimited plans since it switches to I think 2G data if you exceed your limit.  In terms of network coverage, pricing, speed, data, major provider I think that might be one of the best plans out there are the moment.  I got it for my son.  Works great so far."
Demonoid has a decent audiobook section.
"Yeah I got a few things I ordered relatively quickly but after waiting another week I realized they cancelled half of the items without ever telling me. 

Their system is whack. I ordered a couple ceiling fans, 14/3 Romex, switches, face plates, etc and they would mail like 1 box with 1 face plate and another box with another face plate and another separate box with a switch in it. It was the romex and junction box they just randomly dropped off the order for no reason."
"I'll defend Rusty's. It's my favorite ""fast food"" delivery style place in the area.

"Look at all of Logitechs offerings. If you really want to get the most out of it, you will have to learn about lighting and composition. There are lots of YT videos about it, but they all share the same thought: any camera will suck out of the box... proper (not necessarily expensive) lighting is what will make any shot look amazing. If you have an RTX card, you can have the ability to blur out the background."
