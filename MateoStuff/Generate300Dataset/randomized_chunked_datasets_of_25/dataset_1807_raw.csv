"well my family had a 5s from 2013 to early 2020 and it held up perfectly fine aside from being slow. then i shattered it and we officially retired it. my point is, it should work perfectly fine even though its 2 years old. we will eventually see it showing signs of aging maybe on its 4th or 5th birthday, but that happens with all devices anyway."
"I love firefox, I have all my shortcut on it and it syncs on my phone and my other computers automatically, can also send link between a lot of device including my phone. It's a pleasure to use, privacy focused, fast enough for me, and can do a lot of stuff, still keep Chrome in the side for really specific usage (Netflix and Google Earth Studio) but if you don't care about those, don't hesitate, use Firefox. It feels like an apple ecosystem."
"I love how 90% of these come ents are beer and I'm just here like ""but my dad doesn't drink"""
100% HD got it down. Also prefer their in house brands vs lowes. I love all the Husky stuff in general.
"Jerry Rice or Joe Montana, yes there is no arguing with Rice's stats but (in my opinion, as the question states) Joe was, inspirational. The memories I have as a child, the energy, watching him, he is what made me a football fan."
"Well, I'm in my early thirties but signorina by Salvatore ferragamo and mademoiselle by Chanel are my two go-tos."
"I definitely save a lot of money on groceries with my chest freezer. I rarely buy meat unless it is on sale. When I do find a good deal I stock up. 

I also get a lot of free food! In hunting season, and after butchering livestock, friends and relatives give us meat that they've run out of room for and we get often get excess from their gardens too. They don't want the food to go to waste and they know we'll put it in our freezer and happily eat it. 

It is also nice to keep a stockpile of frozen fruit and veggies so we can make smoothies rather than go to the store for ice cream when we get a sweet craving or have veggies on hand when we haven't been able to make it to the grocery store for a few days. 

The extra room is also really nice for meal planning. I can save ham bones for split pea soup or make extra large batches of soup, sauces, pulled pork, etc. and freeze the leftovers for nights when there just isn't time or motivation to cook... and I still have room for ice trays in my regular freezer! 

As for the electric bill, I really have not noticed any change in cost. The amount of electricity used is so small it isn't really noticeable."
"no, they would just be testing realistic scenarios instead of artificial cpu bottleneck scenarios."
"* It also introduced a much faster processor - the A9 was one of the biggest CPU and GPU jumps ever in an iPhone, with 70% and 90% gains over the A8.

* 2GB RAM, which made a massive difference.

* The modem was upgraded to LTE Advanced.

* Gaskets were added to make the phone water resistant. It wasn‚Äôt marketed that way until the following year‚Äôs iPhone 7, but it was the 6S when the iPhone first gained water resistance.

* The Taptic Engine. Just like above, it wasn‚Äôt really marketed that way until it was improved with the iPhone 7, but it was actually the 6S when Apple switched from the old rumble to the precise Taptic Engine using a linear actuator.

* ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù. This was the first phone that allowed you to activate Siri with your voice.


The iPhone 6S truly was a gem. It‚Äôs insane how many improvements it provided.

Apple typically has camera years, performance years, new hardware feature years, new hardware UI input years, case redesign years, new display years, and improved connectivity years. Usually a new iPhone will focus on maybe 2-3 of those 7 categories, and then the next year they‚Äôll focus on 2 more. The iPhone 6S got 5 of the 7 categories. It was truly a *massive* upgrade.

Perhaps that explains why the iPhone 6 was such a small upgrade. It‚Äôs like the new tech wasn‚Äôt quite ready, so it got pushed back, and then the 6S ended up getting two years worth of upgrades in one phone."
"I have no clue or guesses, but I appreciate seeing Salted Green Mango on someones listüëç"
"It has a dark mode, tap half circle at the right top"
I myself made a video on it.  [Take a look at my tutorial video on how to disable turbo boost on Ryzen 4000 series laptops.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl4Fs-ZjlkA)
It's all about the preshow TMs.
"Fun Fact #4: it's not actually made of cheese. It is made of Cheese Analogue, and was placed there in the 40s as a marketing ploy by Kraft."
GTX 1660 Super for $230. Paired with a Ryzen 5 3600 and 16 GB 3600 speed 16 cas RAM gets me a stable 75 FPS max settings (except RTX) while playing Modern Warfare.
I got the work - Lil Uzi Vert
"The Good Place is pretty good, so is B99 and early Modern Family, but it would help to know what kinds of shows you *did* enjoy, rather than all the ones you didn‚Äôt like."
"RIP nate dogg. 

That song is still awesome every time"
"I used to read the Washington Post on a regular basis when I was home from school, but they changed the typeface and layout in order to seem ""more relevant"" to us digital kiddies. It's difficult to explain how disconcerting it is when a newspaper you've been reading for 20 years suddenly looks like something else entirely."
"Don't get Sun and Moon, UsUm is the same game with added dlc. Also, try going after the Mystery Dungeon games, my suggestion is the DS games because the 3ds games suck"
I've got the K702's and HD 800's. The K702's are definitely not the poor man's HD 800.
"Great stuff, love the filters. 

Even though I dont understand the math (Arkham horror seems dragged down big time cause one guy put in in his 90 {and I kinda agree with him}) it gets me able to filter down a world of games to a nice little list.  Well done."
"5.King Of Fighters (SNES)

4.Dead Rising (X360)

3.Super Mario Sunshine (Gamecube)

2.Wild 9 (PS1) Didn't expect that did ya?

1.Madworld(Wii)

Couldn't really decide so I put games I first remembered."
"Jamie Lee Curtis 

I worked with special needs young adults and was with a client at Gamestop. A woman walked in with a teenager and they were shopping around. We were the only customers there and when she asked for help from an associate I loved the way she spoke. 

I went to ask her where she was from and stopped before blurting out ""Wow. Has anyone told you that you look exactly like Jamie Lee Curtis?"" to which she smiled and replied ""That's because I am her."" 

I apologized and let her get back to her shopping. Afterward as she was about to leave I asked her if it would be alright if I called my wife and told her where it was I ran into her (I didn't know if she wanted her location blasted) and she said ""Of course. Want to take a picture?""

Absolute solid human. Love her."
John dies atthe end
