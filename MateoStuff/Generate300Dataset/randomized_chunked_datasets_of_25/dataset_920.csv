34071,best NFL player,Jerry rice.  He holds so many records and not by just a little.  But I am biased.
34767,best NFL player,"This is a difficult question, but if I can define greatness as being a great player and improving a team outside of the system he is in, one of the greatest could be Brett Favre. I could see him succeed in any team when he played and improve the play of his teammates more than any other player I have seen. I think John Unitas was a similar type of player, but I never saw him play, but again, he could have gone into any team and that team would have been a contender. I would say the same for Peyton Manning."
45401,best gaming system,"Well I can't speak for myself because I don't own any current consoles (although I grew up with them from the SNES and Genesis and had them up to the PS3 and 360 along with PC gaming...stopped console gaming altogether in 2013 before the PS4 came out), but from what I've seen with my friends and family who has both, they have different use cases. Some of them have a shitty pre-built or a Macbook Pro and use that for their PC needs and use a console for their gaming needs. Others who have a capable gaming PC and use it for everything and use a console for exclusives. 

As far as those people who have a capable PC and have a PS console, they were more than willing to pick up HZD again on PC for the simple fact that it can run at 60fps. At least that's what they told me when I asked them why they doubled dipped. They said the same thing about RDR2."

57620,best cologne,I’ve tried that one but it smells a bit too soapy for me and somehow more athletic than I ever feel.
7136,best iPhone,"The sides are definitely slippier though. They get... oily? Not sure what's happening. May be the black coating, I had a silver before

Had to get a case for the winter"
57758,best cologne,"My ex gf had this, it's the unisex one right? Anytime I got ready in hers I'd use that instead of my own, great fragrance."
49382,best gaming monitor,"The Lenovo Legion Y27q-20 uses the same panel as the Dell. I picked one up for 364 dollars a week ago. Unfortunately, the sale is no longer active, but I'd recommend keeping an eye out. It's basically a perfect 16:9 monitor imo."
62903,Best Data Science textbook,Got the prac book. It’s pretty useful and gives a general layout on statistical methods to machine learning. Nothing is too in depth and I would pair it up with actual examples that you can work on which will help speed things up.

38234,best newspapers to read,"NY Times is balanced outside of editorials? What are you smoking? Politics pervade everything in that paper, including the weather and music section."
1718,best ice cream flavor,"Vanilla is tops. As it also easily becomes any other flavor. Without it the rest wouldn’t be. But butter pecan, strawberry or peach I would be happy to get over chocolate. Chocolate though if a cheap carton of it will to me taste better than the vanilla from the same brand. Black walnut though was not for me at all."
72100,best movies with a cool twist,"I concur.  I did enjoy the twist to The Sixth Sense and the needing to rewatch the film to ensure it all now made sense.  I also felt stupid for entirely dismissing the fact that he is shot at point blank range at the beginning of the film.  The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and Cape Fear were equally well done.  The Village for me was a cop out.  As was Vanilla sky.  Was very disappointed watching these."

40878,best instrument to play,"Piano. It can be sexy, funny, emotive and anything in between. It shows good finger dexterity. And it's a classic without being a acoustic guitar."

4397,best text editor,"That's the idea, though - you start with a bare-bones editor, and add the functionality you want.  The menu options are all for features you use, so no wading through tangled menus to find the feature you're looking for.  Sure, it takes longer to set up, but in the end you get what you want, not what someone else assumes you want."

71296,best movies with a cool twist,After posting it I had to watch it again. Its so tense and I can really empathize with how frightened Peter must be...I was shaking!
41649,movies like Inception,"If you haven't seen *Memento,* which was what put Nolan in the view of mainstream filmgoers, it's definitely worth a watch.

Can you say more about what you liked about *Inception* that you're looking for in other movies? Was it the style itself, the team-pulls-off-a-heist story, the high concept of going into someone else's mind, the ambiguity factor, the grand landscapes/set-pieces? Knowing more about what you're looking for might help folks give better recommendations.

For a completely off-the-wall recommendation, but one which may be a kind of spiritual sibling to *Inception,* check out *Dave Made A Maze* if you want to have some fun. 

Best of luck!"
