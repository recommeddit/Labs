34767,"This is a difficult question, but if I can define greatness as being a great player and improving a team outside of the system he is in, one of the greatest could be Brett Favre. I could see him succeed in any team when he played and improve the play of his teammates more than any other player I have seen. I think John Unitas was a similar type of player, but I never saw him play, but again, he could have gone into any team and that team would have been a contender. I would say the same for Peyton Manning.",best NFL player
45401,"Well I can't speak for myself because I don't own any current consoles (although I grew up with them from the SNES and Genesis and had them up to the PS3 and 360 along with PC gaming...stopped console gaming altogether in 2013 before the PS4 came out), but from what I've seen with my friends and family who has both, they have different use cases. Some of them have a shitty pre-built or a Macbook Pro and use that for their PC needs and use a console for their gaming needs. Others who have a capable gaming PC and use it for everything and use a console for exclusives. 

As far as those people who have a capable PC and have a PS console, they were more than willing to pick up HZD again on PC for the simple fact that it can run at 60fps. At least that's what they told me when I asked them why they doubled dipped. They said the same thing about RDR2.",best gaming system

72100,"I concur.  I did enjoy the twist to The Sixth Sense and the needing to rewatch the film to ensure it all now made sense.  I also felt stupid for entirely dismissing the fact that he is shot at point blank range at the beginning of the film.  The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and Cape Fear were equally well done.  The Village for me was a cop out.  As was Vanilla sky.  Was very disappointed watching these.",best movies with a cool twist

41649,"If you haven't seen *Memento,* which was what put Nolan in the view of mainstream filmgoers, it's definitely worth a watch.

Can you say more about what you liked about *Inception* that you're looking for in other movies? Was it the style itself, the team-pulls-off-a-heist story, the high concept of going into someone else's mind, the ambiguity factor, the grand landscapes/set-pieces? Knowing more about what you're looking for might help folks give better recommendations.

For a completely off-the-wall recommendation, but one which may be a kind of spiritual sibling to *Inception,* check out *Dave Made A Maze* if you want to have some fun. 

Best of luck!",movies like Inception
