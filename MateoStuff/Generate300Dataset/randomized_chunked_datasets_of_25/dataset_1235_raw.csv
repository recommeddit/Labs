"Hey, I have a question:

Starting from the 70s, if limited overs stats are taken into account, does the list remain unchanged?"
"""could only learn one instrument"" is silly. All great musicians know multiple instruments.

I actually tried to learn the piano when I was in my early 20/late teens but had to give up due to lack of materials online for learning piano. When I got into my late 20s I decided to start learning guitar. I found it much easier to learn as there are tabs and stuff for every song imaginable, while fining piano music for popular songs is very hard. Once I learned guitar well, I returned to the piano and I was able to be a pretty good pianoist from transferring what I learned on guitar. So I say learn guitar first then transition to piano. I find piano tutorials on youtube and stuff like that very poor."
"Awesome, thank you!!"
"Are you in nz? If so which part? The 400nzd cap really kills it though, even if you get a used he400 for say 250usd you may get slammed with customs/import tax when you include shipping. If you have a chance to go to china or have friends visiting, yiu can pick them uo cheap there. He400i is like 350usd in china! And one user on here got a used demo unit from CL for 500nzd which i dont think was a good deal as thats how much i paid for mine new. When they did advertise them in stock on their website and in store, before they were closing out hifiman due to discontinuation he500s were going for 1200nzd, he-6 were 1800-1900nzd....."
"Grid is probably the most realistic racing game on Switch but no modification in it. Great car list and tons of tracks but the career is not really fun. 

CarX Drift Racing Online has extensive car customisation but the whole game is focused on drifting and the handling is very arcade (turn left to drift left, no counter steering). 

Gear Club 2 has car customisation and the handling is okay. Track design is not the best either."
I have this thought once in awhile.  God damn that game is good.  It felt like a perfect blend of Dynasty Warriors and RTS with a badass world and badass music.
It's still fun backwards
Me and my siblings are all kicking in some money (there's a total of 5 of us) and we're buying my mom a ring that has each of our birthstones on it. Her mom has one (8 kids) and HER mom had one as well (6 kids)
But I don't want to change timelines.
SMC was so well executed except for the bots and playerbase. :( Game was amazingly built otherwise.

"Last Christmas I gave my mom a bracelet. She is always happy with what I give her, but this bracelet was special. On the bracelet was a quote that we would always say to each other every night before bed when I was growing up. “I love you bigger than the heavens.” I don’t think I’ve said that to her I’m a few years. Seeing it on her bracelet made her cry. I don’t think I’m going to be able to top it."
I'm really into anything by Tessa Dare right now. She creates intriguing characters and wonderfully silly situations that some how fit perfectly into the story.
"Theater/drama degree here.. Started teaching the subject.. I'm doing what I like,  money isn't the best but then again do we ever really make enough money?"

Holy crap I haven’t laughed that hard in some time
"Yeah. I think [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/oSuqv) is the most up close picture I've been able to get of the Falls (taken yesterday afternoon); I don't think I've managed anything like it from the NY side, but maybe other people have."
Sounds like something people really need to publicise. If it was well known how much group work was necessary in computer science the whole anti-social programmer problem might clear itself up...
"Disclaimer: This recommendation is a world that has 3 series, and sort of 2 stand alone books shoved in randomly, but I do recommend reading the entire series of at least one Hh to understand it all :)

The entire Night Huntress world by Jeaniene Frost. I love all of the boos and have re-read multiple times. There are currently 3 main Hh combinations in this world: Cat and Bones, Clad and Leila, and Ian and Veritas. I would have a very hard time choosing which is my favorite. The only couple with books still being written though is Ian and Veritas.


Separately I still go back to Flatshare by Beth O’Leary a lot, it’s very sweet.

Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating by Christina Lauren despite me not loving other things I’ve read by them.


If you’re looking for absolutely pain and love I couldn’t put down In the Unlikely Event by LJ Shen."
Ticket to ride is a great board game
Why are so many people looking at Kali?
