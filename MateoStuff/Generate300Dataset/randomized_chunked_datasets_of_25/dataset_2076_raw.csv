"I'm utterly biased but short, to the point and revolutionary: [Woese's 1977 paper outlining the discovery of the archaea](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC432104/?tool=pmcentrez) (not formally classified as a separate domain of life until [this paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576.full.pdf+html)) 

Apart from that I also love whole exchange around the development of understanding into vesicle trafficking and in particular Jim Rothman's papers (brilliant experiments, great results, somewhat incorrect conclusions) but probably requires to get into field a bit too much to be of use for this exercise. 

I also love almost anything by [Sean Nee](http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/snee/publications.htm) because he does good science, reports it concisely and clearly and is entirely irreverent (for an amusing, single page, incredibly accessible essay by him (not a paper) check out [the Great Chain of Being](http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/snee/chain.pdf).

Finally, for a wonderful example of scientific squabbling and missing each other's points there is [Trewavas' Green Plants as Intelligent Organisms](http://www.mediafire.com/?8d4p7dygrum1oaf), to which there was [this 33 prominent author backlash](http://blumwald.ucdavis.edu/publications/Alpi%202007.pdf) followed by Trewavas' [reply](http://www.linv.org/images/about_pdf/Trends%202007%20Trewavas.pdf)."

I'm so sorry that you ladies have such a hard time with the internal plumbing. My limited male experience has taught me that none of you are the same and all the advice is bad."

$1500 for a 3060 is way to high imo.. Its only marginally better than a 2060 ( like 10-15 fps more in games)

"[This is an excellent book on the Eastern Front](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Forgotten-Soldier-Cassell-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304352403/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281116643&sr=1-1) by an Alsatian Frenchman who volunteered for service with the Germans in 1942. It's a memoir, and the 1st hand accounts are appalling: for starters, experiencing an artillery barrage (people are simply buried alive sometimes), being stuck on a truck in -30 degree weather with dysentery induced diarrhea and no place even to lay down. Not to mention returning home to a lot of hard questions..."
