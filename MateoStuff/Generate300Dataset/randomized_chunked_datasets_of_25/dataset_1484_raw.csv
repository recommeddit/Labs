"screw the dyson and get the roomba -- life. saver. 

Set the button after meals and it saved so much time. Especially during the food throwing phase. Get the scooba for mopping the floors. Best combo ever."
"Western PA checking in, it isn’t us.

Maybe it’s those weirdos up on the the glorified file tab they call Erie."
"In case you don't like JRPG's, might I suggest Days Gone?"
Amy honestly seems so precious. I feel like she’d be a joy to hang out with.
"I agree, Heartgold is my favourite pokemon game of all time, everything about it is excellent: the story, the battles, and the music. I really like the style of graphics and gameplay from everything from generations 1-5, and then generation 6 onward just isn't the right style."
I wear Nike Epic React Flyknit 2 and like them. But I’m no shoe expert
"Her period romances are great, but her mysteries are not nearly as good. Everything I dislike about Agatha Christie's books, and none of the redeeming features."
Adderal is life. Makes thinking like the normal people possible.
"My favorite album so far this year is Pray for Haiti. First Mach-Hommy album I’ve listened to and I loved it. I’m a big fan of Westside Gunn and Griselda in general so I knew I was going to like it at least somewhat going into it, but it still ended up blowing me away. West just has such a great ear for beats and knows how to curate that type of stuff so well. 

I also really enjoyed La Maquina from Conway. Great work from top to bottom. 200 Pies, Sister Abigail, Scatter Brain, Brusier Body and S.E. Gang were standouts to me. 

Other favorites of mine so far this year are The Plugs I Met 2, If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed, The Off Season, Tha Wolf on Wall St and To Kill a Sunrise.

Been enjoying the new Peter Rosenberg, Lloyd Banks and Smoke DZA lately. Excited to see what the rest of the year brings."
"My aunt (her biological sister) passed away about 2 years ago (age 40, unexpected death). Last year, my sister and I restored and framed some old pictures of the two together. She absolutely loved it and started crying and we started crying and it was just a cry fest."
"yes, **all time**, not from 1900-1950."
Did you get something else than XPS?

"Tequila (preferably Don Julio) with soda and a splash of grapefruit!

Tequila is my favorite but I hate margs because the sugar overload is always too much for me, so this drink is a dream concoction for me. Also, if I want something a little sweeter, I do pineapple instead of grapefruit."
"tree, mv, cp, tar"
"I personally like HeartGold/Soulsilver the most, 2 regions and Pokémon following you is just awesome"
"I loved ""lovely"" as well!!!!!! I also have her ""covet"" which is a very mossy, beautiful scent."
I crack them lengthwise (same axis you would cut along for deviled eggs). don't have to peel much and once one half is off the egg just pops out.
lol same. although i actually was just thinking about finally getting a new console... but now is actually a terrible time to buy them. rip
"Man, I wish we could get that here, my state banned it, can only get the 151 proof, which ends up being way too thin when mixed down."
How does requiem for a dream have a twist ending? I disagree
