49074,best gaming monitor,"Idk how the prices in us are but in Canada I built my pc in may and got a 1440p144 monitor and the cheapest one was a Samsung, I think it was like c27jg52, it was a curved monitor if you had one and didn't like it then ignore me, but honestly it's pretty much the same as a flat monitor, the stand was shit but I wanted a vesa anyways and honestly it's great, it doesn't have freesync but with high enough frames it shouldn't be an issue really, it is a va panel so if you don't like that then it's not for you either."
67003,best soccer team in the world,Guardiola's Barca did the same as well

40229,best midrange CPU,"It's getting hard to find these real world application benchmarks. For me when I searched for 3300x vs 1600af comparison with a realistic GPU in this budget, first non 2080 result was 31st video on list"
67936,best science fiction novel,Zoe's Tale was a YA version of The Last Colony
37185,best amusement park,"If you're going for the best overall experience inside the park, I say Disneyland. If you're looking for the best roller coasters, then you should go with Six Flags. If you want the best bang for your buck and a great experience outside the park, I'd go with Knott's Berry Farm. 

Personally, I like Knott's, because:

* I felt that the ratio of ride:wait was the best (albeit from my experience a few years ago).
* Compared to the other amusement parks, they were moderately-priced.
* It has lots of variety in rides.
* The food options are decent inside the park.
* There's great Korean food right outside the park, from Korean soups to Korean BBQ. There's also a huge plaza nearby called [The Source](https://www.thesourceoc.com/), which has a lot of things to do and eat.
* There's a [Porto's](https://www.portosbakery.com/) bakery very close to the park. They're a beloved bakery in the Greater Los Angeles area, and I really love their Milk and Berries cake. Their potato balls, Plato de Pollo, and fresh fruit tartlets are also very good."
37401,best amusement park,Kings Island because every ride there gives amazing night rides.
12473,best gifts for mom,"My moms favorite cat had passed away earlier in the year so I got one of her favorite pictures of the cat, scanned it, added a poem I found somewhere and added some basic touches and framed it.  She cried for a bit and told me how much she loved it.  Still hanging somewhere I think."
37602,best Marvel movie,"At this point I think everyone is trolling about how they feel about AoU. Really, 20th? Also shoutout to those who predicted the comments lol"
37462,best amusement park,"I wouldn't call it a household name outside of the enthusiast circle. Whenever I travel around in the US alone to different parks and mention Carowinds, nobody has ever heard of it (even at other Cedar Fair parks)."
66970,best soccer team in the world,What's that
67317,axios alternatives reddit,"They had a security issue like that but handled it ~~badly~~ not so great. The fix (for a long lived vulnerability) was in master for 3 weeks before publishing to npm, and then they broke third party plugins. From the original post I linked:

> Denial of Service Vulnerability

> On April 25th 2019, snyk.io users started getting a security warning about a DoS vulnerability in Axios. Others followed after snyk published a blog post about it.
> 
> This issue was first reported on Sep 22, 2017. That is almost 2 years ago.
> 
> And the fix? Just a single line of code.

> stream.destroy();"
72510,best keyboard switches,Someone's going to say something dumb about 2-key rollover on the M that doesn't actually matter 99% of the time.
30148,best Mexican war to study,"In my part of the country it is taught mainly as something that contributed to the Civil War:

1. We learned that the abolitionists and early Republicans opposed the war, seeing it as an illegitimate effort to expand slavery.
2. We read [Civil Disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Disobedience_(Thoreau)) by Thoreau and learned about his argument that Americans should refuse to pay taxes because the taxes were being used to fund a dishonorable invasion of a neighboring country, designed to spread slavery
3. We learned that Abraham Lincoln gained national prominence through the [Spot Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Resolutions), which attempted to prevent the invasion of Mexico
4. We learned that after the war, the slave states were outraged by abolitionists' efforts to prevent slavery in the territory taken from Mexico. The slave states saw expanded slavery as their fair reward for supporting the invasion. We learned that this was a major cause of the confederate states leaving the Union
5. During the Civil War, the military commanders on both sides had served together in the Mexican-American war. They applied lessons from that war against each other"
33957,best Pokemon game,"Yellow, Emerald and Gold/Silver. 

Yellow has Ash + Pikachu as player. Don’t think any other game has that. 

Emerald was just amazing. I think Hoenn was the last “good” region of Pokémon. 

Gold/Silver lets you play Jhoto and Kanto. Blew my mind when I was younger."
20049,best workout music,Why is matt and kim not on this list?
22264,best celebrity,"As a woman, I really don't expect much from athletes. I admit, I'm judgmental and I assume they're meat-heads (I know it's wrong, but at least I fess up to it). But this makes me happy. It's good to know that some of them are stand-up gentlemen."
32084,best hotel to live in,"Tattoos in Japan are usually a sign of the mafia Yakuza. It's pretty taboo in spas. Some are accepting of tattoos, but most make you cover up.

""This is because there is recognition in Japan from historical background that tattoo, so-called Irezumi in Japan, is “something anti-social people get” or “something members of illegal organization such as gangsters get.” ""

""I think that the main reasons why it changed into dirty image are because criminals got Irezumi as a sentence in the same Edo period, Irezumi was outlawed in the Meiji era and later, and gangster members have got Irezumi as a mean to show their power.

In this way, the image is very intensive in Japanese society that people with tattoo = members of anti-social forces, thus there is not a little possibility that customers tend to avoid the public bath if they see a person with tattoo there. ""
