37185,"If you're going for the best overall experience inside the park, I say Disneyland. If you're looking for the best roller coasters, then you should go with Six Flags. If you want the best bang for your buck and a great experience outside the park, I'd go with Knott's Berry Farm. 

Personally, I like Knott's, because:

* I felt that the ratio of ride:wait was the best (albeit from my experience a few years ago).
* Compared to the other amusement parks, they were moderately-priced.
* It has lots of variety in rides.
* The food options are decent inside the park.
* There's great Korean food right outside the park, from Korean soups to Korean BBQ. There's also a huge plaza nearby called [The Source](https://www.thesourceoc.com/), which has a lot of things to do and eat.
* There's a [Porto's](https://www.portosbakery.com/) bakery very close to the park. They're a beloved bakery in the Greater Los Angeles area, and I really love their Milk and Berries cake. Their potato balls, Plato de Pollo, and fresh fruit tartlets are also very good.",best amusement park

30148,"In my part of the country it is taught mainly as something that contributed to the Civil War:

1. We learned that the abolitionists and early Republicans opposed the war, seeing it as an illegitimate effort to expand slavery.
2. We read [Civil Disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Disobedience_(Thoreau)) by Thoreau and learned about his argument that Americans should refuse to pay taxes because the taxes were being used to fund a dishonorable invasion of a neighboring country, designed to spread slavery
3. We learned that Abraham Lincoln gained national prominence through the [Spot Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Resolutions), which attempted to prevent the invasion of Mexico
4. We learned that after the war, the slave states were outraged by abolitionists' efforts to prevent slavery in the territory taken from Mexico. The slave states saw expanded slavery as their fair reward for supporting the invasion. We learned that this was a major cause of the confederate states leaving the Union
5. During the Civil War, the military commanders on both sides had served together in the Mexican-American war. They applied lessons from that war against each other",best Mexican war to study

32084,"Tattoos in Japan are usually a sign of the mafia Yakuza. It's pretty taboo in spas. Some are accepting of tattoos, but most make you cover up.

""This is because there is recognition in Japan from historical background that tattoo, so-called Irezumi in Japan, is “something anti-social people get” or “something members of illegal organization such as gangsters get.” ""

""I think that the main reasons why it changed into dirty image are because criminals got Irezumi as a sentence in the same Edo period, Irezumi was outlawed in the Meiji era and later, and gangster members have got Irezumi as a mean to show their power.

In this way, the image is very intensive in Japanese society that people with tattoo = members of anti-social forces, thus there is not a little possibility that customers tend to avoid the public bath if they see a person with tattoo there. ""
