"Yes, if it's just a few days of no power and you don't need to actually drive your truck anywhere.

Personally, considering the battery backup feature is only with the highest end Lightning package (which is like $90k+), I'd rather get a cheaper Lightning, and buy an actual battery backup for home solar which will work 24/7 and allow me to drive my truck whenever."

"I find her character hard to watch - or listen to, really. So OTT that it' s like nails on a chalk

"That's fair but for the ones I've looked at for every person going above the given range there's another going below, though to be fair most of them do seem to like getting as close to budget as possible even if that means one much newer/better part than the others"
"Same. I work as a data analyst for a very large company and I do some programming and database design. While I got zilch of these actual skills from my time at college and grad school, I directly credit studying logic and argumentation in philosophy and theology courses that caused me to be good at what I do.
