31730,best hotel to live in,"How do you survive on room service? I'm over it after a week.

18169,best YouTube video,One of the funniest things I've ever seen. Absolute genius.
56776,best desktop monitor,"I have this and love this. Blacks could be better, but it's a cheap display. It definitely has a lot of reflection, so wouldn't use it anywhere there's a lot of sunlight coming in."
2906,best headphones,"Sure.  I'm planning to upgrade to either Sundaras or Arias at some point in the future.

The positional accuracy of the K612's are not to be underestimated, though, they are absolutely fantastic -- extremely flat with a huge soundstage.  I prefer them for gaming to the 400i's I use primarily for music."
44788,best items under $100,The Q20s we're game changing for me. I can't imagine working without them now.
7871,best laptop for general use,"You might want to get the 4700u (or 5700u, essentially a 4800u, fairly soon) variant if you value gaming less and are planning to code on virtual machines.

Ignoring the convertibility, I'd personally prefer Zenbook 14 over Lenovo Flex 5 for its portability, the larger battery, and its aesthetics."
130,best terminal file manager reddit,"I love how only the Pythons programmers think it is relevant for the end-user what it is written in. I kinda like the language, but the community is horrible."

33075,best energy drink,"Actually, it didn't need to be fixed.  That's how I drink them...but I'm willing to do a little research with your new formulas.  You, sir, may be some kind of genius....we'll have to wait and see."
10880,best suitcase lock,Every time my bag's been opened there's a love letter from the TSA notifying me.
47709,best state to visit in the United States,"West Virginia : Dolly Sods/Spruce Knob/Seneca Rocks are my favorite.  Spruce knob is where I do a lot of native trout fishing, but even just driving through the mountains in that area, especially during the fall, is absolutely beautiful.

Spruce knob is the highest point in the state and if you go up to the very top, the spruce trees only grow branches on one side because of the strong winds up there.

Also, I'd highly recommend catching bridge day in October in summersville.  They close down the new river gorge bridge and base jumpers jump/catapult themselves off the bridge.  If you know you're going in advance, call the chamber of commerce and ask about a bus pass to take the bus to the bottom/top.  Generally, they close the road to the public that would take you to the bottom underneath the bridge, and the spectators are generally confined to the bridge itself or a scenic overlook off the the side to watch.  With the bus pass, you can hop on the buss that makes trips up and down the mountain to transport the jumpers.  Totally worth it.

There also a ton of hiking/biking trails, some
Of the best whitewater rafting in the country, and Summerville lake all in that area.  Not to mention the original pies and pints, in Fayetteville (which is a few miles beyond the new river gorge) which is a cool local pizza joint that is growing throughout the state that specializes in specialty craft pizzas and craft beer."
39191,best web browser,I find it is way faster than chrome and is not all kitchen sinky like chrome has become. It has some built in Adblock features and customizable settings. I have not used opera.
13137,best gifts for mom,"If going to baby-showers my advice is a date night for the couple. Like a gift card to a nice restaurant. 

A lot of attention is focused on the little bundle of joy and sometimes the parents can get so caught up in preparing for the new arrival they will forget about themselves and are in a state of panic, worry, anxiousness and are probably stressed beyond belief. 

So a nice night out is a good way for them to relax, unwind, and get themselves back on track."
