47709,"West Virginia : Dolly Sods/Spruce Knob/Seneca Rocks are my favorite.  Spruce knob is where I do a lot of native trout fishing, but even just driving through the mountains in that area, especially during the fall, is absolutely beautiful.

Spruce knob is the highest point in the state and if you go up to the very top, the spruce trees only grow branches on one side because of the strong winds up there.

Also, I'd highly recommend catching bridge day in October in summersville.  They close down the new river gorge bridge and base jumpers jump/catapult themselves off the bridge.  If you know you're going in advance, call the chamber of commerce and ask about a bus pass to take the bus to the bottom/top.  Generally, they close the road to the public that would take you to the bottom underneath the bridge, and the spectators are generally confined to the bridge itself or a scenic overlook off the the side to watch.  With the bus pass, you can hop on the buss that makes trips up and down the mountain to transport the jumpers.  Totally worth it.

There also a ton of hiking/biking trails, some
Of the best whitewater rafting in the country, and Summerville lake all in that area.  Not to mention the original pies and pints, in Fayetteville (which is a few miles beyond the new river gorge) which is a cool local pizza joint that is growing throughout the state that specializes in specialty craft pizzas and craft beer.",best state to visit in the United States

13137,"If going to baby-showers my advice is a date night for the couple. Like a gift card to a nice restaurant. 

A lot of attention is focused on the little bundle of joy and sometimes the parents can get so caught up in preparing for the new arrival they will forget about themselves and are in a state of panic, worry, anxiousness and are probably stressed beyond belief. 

So a nice night out is a good way for them to relax, unwind, and get themselves back on track.",best gifts for mom
