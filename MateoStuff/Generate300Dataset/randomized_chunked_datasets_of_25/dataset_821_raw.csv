"Well yes, there's good and bad of everything. But I could make a gallon of mead for $10 (give or take, depending on ingredients). Good commercial meads start at $25 - $30 for a 750 ml bottle. So even with an occasional bad batch it comes out ahead."
How is it possible to have TLOP above Late Registration and 808s? How can you put Graduation second? Why is Complex consistently terrible?
"This thread. I like it.

I'd suggest the Crash Bandicoot series. Immensely fun platformers and a racing game, back when Naughty Dog made games and not movies."

"I personally don't recommend them often, but the new Surface Laptop 4, which wasn't available at the time of me making this list, is a really solid Ryzen 4000 option."

"Ewan McGregor accidentally ran over my bf's foot a couple of years ago when he was filming his Long Way Round series. He was absolutely lovely though, my bf loves bikes so he was over the moon bless him. Apparently they talked about his GS for a couple of minutes together, apparently it's one of his favourite memories. He had to restrain himself a little from roasting the GS as they are notorious for their unreliability"
"On WTF with Marc Maron, Weird Al tells the story about attending the Grammies. Said he was seated next to Prince. Weird Al says that he received a letter from Prince's people in the days running up to the event , saying that Weird Al was not to make eye contact or interact with Prince during the event. So, yeah, there's that..."

Going caseless. as always.
A rice cooker.  Sounds silly but it really did change my life.  I've never made such perfect rice before.
"[Alyssa Cole](https://alyssacole.com/) has some really good books both historical and contemporary. Her protagonists tend to be women of color and her historicals aren't all set in England (which tends to happen in romances). 

I'm also going to second [Smart Bitches Trashy Books](www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com) as a resource for finding well written reviews of romance novels and their daily sales posts are really nice. 

For contemporaries I also like Shannon Stacey, Linda Howard, Julie James, and Nora Roberts (has a huge back catalog with some paranormals in there). For more erotic writing I've enjoyed the Beyond series from Kit Rocha but it's pretty BDSM heavy."

"recently me neither. My hotshot is from 2010, now a days TNF has definitely lowered R&D budgets in favor of a large marketing one. The dad has a few vintage ones from the 80's and theyre still in great shape."
"As always the real LPTs are either in the comments or in the /r/undelete/ sub. The TSA can, will, and is mandated to open your bags and check them. If you put a padlock on your bag they will either open the zipper as descibed above or they will straight up cut the lock or even cut open the bag itself if needed.

Do not put anything you would be exceptionally upset to lose in checked baggage. This includes valuables, electronics, medicines, gifts, etc... Ship it via UPS or USPS, and insure it if it's exceptionally valuable."
