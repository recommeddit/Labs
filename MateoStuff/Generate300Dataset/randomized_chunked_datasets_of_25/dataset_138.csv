More seriously: At the time I bought mine (high school student), I thought it was terribly expensive. Of course now $70 doesn't seem that bad, but I'm quite miserly.",best backpack for college

29514,"You forgot the Kingdom Hearts series, which IMO was one of the best games on the PS2. It's a mix of Square Enix and Disney, which sounds weird at first but I'm telling you, they did it sooo well.

Here's a list of the games and their respective consoles, in the chronological order (will also number the order the games came out):

6th) KH: Birth by Sleep - PSP

1st) Kingdom Hearts -PS2

2nd) KH: Chain of Memories - Original on the Gameboy, and 3D remake on the PS2

5th) KH: 358/2 Days - DS (runs concurrently with CoM)

3rd) Kingdom Hearts 2: - PS2

4th) KH: Coded - Originally a spinoff for a certain mobile phone. It was remade for the DS.

7th) KH3D: Dream Drop Distance - 3DS

8th) Kingdom Hearts 3 - PS4/XBOne (coming soon)


There are to HD remasters for the PS3:

KH HD ReMix 1.5 - Includes KH1, Chain of Memories, and 358/2 Days

KH HD ReMix 2.5 - Includes KH2, Birth by Sleep, and Coded



If you haven't tried it yet, I recommend you play the PS3 version. But, it's pretty playable on the PCSX2 emulator (I played it there and it works phenomenal!)",best game console

Insanely nice place with unbelievable service. The most enjoyable was [Sala Phuket](https://images.app.goo.gl/Pu58Qaswd3uyzEJk7) in Thailand.

If you listened to bass heavy genres you would have found them lacking but if you want clear vocals and acoustics these are the phones for you. As an added bonus of the many budget headphones that have passed through me these are by far the most comfortable to wear.They are currently on sale for $67.95  on Amazon.com


Now - just buy AKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphones, on sale for $68.29(from $159.00). These are considered one of the best semi-professional headphones for under $200 and the fact that you can get them for $70 is just mind-boggling.",best headphones

I used to walk about 1/4 mile down the road where the bus dropped me off and sometimes I'd just kick the bag most of the way. Sometimes I'd throw it into the air just for the satisfying way it hit the ground. These days it mostly just gets overstuffed and tossed into my car or dropped onto rocks from a couple feet up, nothing serious. Now I'm curious as to what else I can get away with.",best backpack for college
