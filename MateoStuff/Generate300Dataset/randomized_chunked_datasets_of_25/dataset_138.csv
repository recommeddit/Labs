just think, he went from being a dentist... to a badass chemist teacher."
41354,best instrument to play,"I love the guitar, acoustic or electric. My favorite electric guitar song is [Falling In Love Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP5UHCMlL7E) by Jack Thammarat.

I also love the sound of a well-trained vocalist. [Music of the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Zci-3ZvYg) with Ramin Karimloo."
11112,best backpack for college,"For silly reasons: they were a status symbol at my high school (specifically the monogrammed sort) and I became prejudiced against people that wore them.

More seriously: At the time I bought mine (high school student), I thought it was terribly expensive. Of course now $70 doesn't seem that bad, but I'm quite miserly."
47483,best state to visit in the United States,"Hilton Head Island, SC"
23153,best social networking site for CS,"LinkedIn is good enough, and Github is very practical if only for sharing your projects. The only big advantage I see from Twitter is if you want to get personally in touch and connected with what other developers are doing in your particular scene or industry. A lot of the more significant contributors in tech are using Twitter."
40916,best instrument to play,And the pedalling. It can be tricky at times

27099,best board games,In general the Dice Tower crowd seems to dictate the top positions. :)

61998,Best RPG game on PS4,"Newcomer to the series here. I just bought the legendary edition and am struggling to push forward due to constantly getting lost and wandering dead ends on the map. Any advice? 

Also the combat is clunky af, game has not aged great."
29514,best game console,"You forgot the Kingdom Hearts series, which IMO was one of the best games on the PS2. It's a mix of Square Enix and Disney, which sounds weird at first but I'm telling you, they did it sooo well.

Here's a list of the games and their respective consoles, in the chronological order (will also number the order the games came out):

6th) KH: Birth by Sleep - PSP

1st) Kingdom Hearts -PS2

2nd) KH: Chain of Memories - Original on the Gameboy, and 3D remake on the PS2

5th) KH: 358/2 Days - DS (runs concurrently with CoM)

3rd) Kingdom Hearts 2: - PS2

4th) KH: Coded - Originally a spinoff for a certain mobile phone. It was remade for the DS.

7th) KH3D: Dream Drop Distance - 3DS

8th) Kingdom Hearts 3 - PS4/XBOne (coming soon)


There are to HD remasters for the PS3:

KH HD ReMix 1.5 - Includes KH1, Chain of Memories, and 358/2 Days

KH HD ReMix 2.5 - Includes KH2, Birth by Sleep, and Coded



If you haven't tried it yet, I recommend you play the PS3 version. But, it's pretty playable on the PCSX2 emulator (I played it there and it works phenomenal!)"
13274,best gifts for mom,"Grandchildren, well that's what mine keep asking for... Gona keep trying with my wifu"
33636,best electric car,"I'm sure niche products will continue to be made and sold to those who can afford them.

I don't see why you should hate or fear the success of something that can help us hand the planet on to future generations."
32122,best hotel to live in,"This is such a tough question because hotels can be qualified so differently. Service vs food vs atmosphere etc. The most luxurious was the [Palace Old Town](https://images.app.goo.gl/aB941gU2ScaRVPRS6) at the foot of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Insanely nice place with unbelievable service. The most enjoyable was [Sala Phuket](https://images.app.goo.gl/Pu58Qaswd3uyzEJk7) in Thailand. I don’t even like the beach, but I still have dreams about the resort and the private pool suite."
43107,best detective show,"not really a ""who dun it"" but the reveal of the mole in season 1 of 24 was amazing and had me on the edge of my seat."
66484,best soccer team in the world,We're ahead of you. The last time we reached a World Cup was last millennium.
34948,best NFL player,"Interesting, thanks for the followup on that. I'd argue that the Butler/Cook play is way more egregious than the Tartt/Metcalf one. Tartt is still in bounds when contact starts, Butler is so far out of bounds that he's off the paint and runs back into the field of play."
18993,best YouTube video,All of his videos are so good. I went back and watched every single one and they're all entertaining. My personal favourite was the No Man's Sky one. Nearly cried at the end.
2555,best headphones,"Before I actually started browsing Amazon.com I would have recommended the AKG k514 MKII. They are clear and airy. Decent highs and lows, but they shine in the middle. If you listened to bass heavy genres you would have found them lacking but if you want clear vocals and acoustics these are the phones for you. As an added bonus of the many budget headphones that have passed through me these are by far the most comfortable to wear.They are currently on sale for $67.95  on Amazon.com


Now - just buy AKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphones, on sale for $68.29(from $159.00). These are considered one of the best semi-professional headphones for under $200 and the fact that you can get them for $70 is just mind-boggling."
11100,best backpack for college,"What are you doing with them? I thought I was pretty hard on mine in High School. I used to walk about 1/4 mile down the road where the bus dropped me off and sometimes I'd just kick the bag most of the way. Sometimes I'd throw it into the air just for the satisfying way it hit the ground. These days it mostly just gets overstuffed and tossed into my car or dropped onto rocks from a couple feet up, nothing serious. Now I'm curious as to what else I can get away with."
19111,best YouTube video,"I like how in one city he heard gunshots and proceeded to run towards them out of curiosity. He’s also toured a South American ghetto, in suit and tie, alone, all while the locals are in the background telling him he’s gonna get killed. Dude’s got some serious balls"
59374,best perfume,"I can’t stand the scent on me, but received the most compliments whenever I wear this perfume - Olympea Legend by Paco Rabbane."
39200,best web browser,I swear firefox looks more like chrome now in those exact ways.
27265,best stocks to buy,"One company I don't see mentioned that perhaps should be - CVS.  

Despite what reddit seems to think... this is not a company that makes the majority of its money on its pharmacy.  Their Caremark and Aetna businesses are health care juggernauts and their MinuteClinic segment is a solid growth play."
41966,movies like Inception,Thorne did help Sagan with the wormhole stuff.
