Lmao I just have big hands my dude. Don‚Äôt take it personally. It‚Äôs tiny. Couldn‚Äôt palm it if I tried
"What I do is place an empty bowl on the porch then place a sign beside it that says ""one only, please""  Probably explains why I have to clean up eggs and toilet paper every November 1st."
Apple products are for the technologically feeble.
"I've heard that about Kim too, that she's really lovely to speak to. I think Kylie gives legit brat vibes"
No way should La Super Rica be on this list. Is that restaurant ever mentioned without name dropping Julia Child? Give me a break. El Bajio down the street is infinitely better.
"Don't mind me. Just checking to see if my static wallpaper changes. Can never be too careful of viruses these days. 

^^^^Sweats ^^^^Profusely"
What else!!!
"Never played with mega evolutions, hope i like it, thanks"
"Nah, Peyton manning is the best qb, he may not have as many rings as Brady, but just look at Peytons stats, he has like 30k more passing yards"
"In no particular order:
1. Monument Valley
2. Thronebreaker
3. Playdead‚Äôs Inside
4. Grimvalor
5. Slay the Spire"
"I guess the argument is that you're gonna end up with 10 different libraries where you don't care about the size. Then you're at 140kb uncompressed (which is also code that your browser has to parse etc, so it's not just about download speeds). Add onto that React and your actual application code, and well. It's easy to end up with quite a bit bundle, and then you have to do some more obstructive solutions like code splitting, etc.

That's all theoretical, of course, I've also never worried about including axios in my code."

Komodo Edit and Notepad++ are both fantastic.
"I used to work at a hotel when I was maybe 20 where this man came in with two young women (definitely teens) and never let them speak, they'd come back somewhat bruised. Then he started coming in with other men (and the girls) everything paid in cash.

My manager said ""it happens. Leave it""

A woman told me the next morning she thinks she was raped by the same men. She woke up naked in her room beat up and with pain in her genitals after having drinks with them.
Management again, ""leave it. She's crazy and was drunk""

So I called the police and corporate and left that day.

Detective called me a couple days later for a report and to come in and ID the man (as well as some 'customers' of the man. Turns out the girls were underage and ""not from here"" is all I was told.
Manager was investigated as a participant and fired.

Any of the recent F1 games
Was there Sunday and I can report that they still have it.
"and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's the scrubbing action/friction that removes pathogens when you wash your hands isn't it, not so much the use of soap?"
"I'm 100% with you. The fact that one night a year, through no fault of your own, a bunch of kids will just show up at your door and demand candy, then either judge you on the candy you give them or throw eggs at your house if you don't give them anything... that's ludicrous. We've got a similar tradition in Germany, not for Halloween but for Saint Martin's Day, where instead of throwing eggs at your house, kids sing shitty carols at you. It makes me sort of glad I'll never be able to afford a house lol."
Amor amor by chacharel ‚ù§ I have been told I smell intoxicating more than once ! Worth a try!
That's hardly true :P
"The reason Webcams in laptops are so terrible is the limited space for a lens assembly. Cell phones are thicker the lid of most notebooks, plus, they can get away with camera bumps. without a lens assembly, the size of the sensor becomes limited too, and auto-focus is not possible either. I'm not sure if it was Linus or Hardware Canucks who made a video about that."
