Hikaru no Go
Code Geass
Beck"
23678,best car racing video game,"Don't pay much attention to PCars 3 comments. It's a fantastic game to teach and for beginners at SimRacing. Starting with games like AC or iRacing it's like starting at gymnastics doing a triple mortal jump. The game teaches very well the basics of weight transfer, the effects of high torque on your car'so behaviour, and how to brake. And you learn a ton of real tracks that will help you out when you transition to higher end sims."
51488,best iphone case,"The clear case is awful. Buttons are hard to push and the case is slippery. Silicone cases are good and comfortable. I prefer the leather cases. Feels great in your hand, color is rich, and the buttons are fantastic. Mason makes a good thin clear case but it’s minimal protection."
12176,best gifts for dad,"I totally agree with this. But I'd still rather get cash than a gift card! Basically:

gift > cash > gift card"
45807,best trick or treating candy,Give me all your Mounds.

50498,best rap album,i like it alot too. but it has some fillers that keeps me from going back to it. at the same time it has some of my favorite tracks of all time tho.
34302,best NFL player,"Noticeably missing is Xavien Howard. I know he gives up a lot in coverage, but I thought PFF still had him rated fairly highly?"
26328,best politician,"Well it is all being recorded.  In some states any lawyer can get anyone's text message records for barely any reason at all.  Just a law suit against someone.  Its primarily used for proving infidelity in divorce proceedings from what I've heard.  

Edit: this information comes from a report I heard on NPR."
56450,best desktop monitor,"Any flicker? As a Samsung 27"" C27FG70 owner with horrible flicker I'm not really that hyped about returning for seconds."
44633,best items under $100,Came here today a nice Kitchen knife
15465,best tree for the garden,"If by ""suburban"" you mean compact clay, then yes, it will do poorly, along with 95% of other plants. As long as you loosen 2-3x the width and plant a couple inches high, I've had no trouble, even in native clay soil. Liquidambar has a taproot and doesn't do well in shallow planting areas e.g. sidewalk plots. Alkaline is easy to remedy when planting.

There are different cultivars of Amelanchier that don't get as big. 'Rainbow Pillar' is a nice one.

Is alternifolia resistance to dogwood anthracnose? I generally don't recommend them much anymore."
69335,best major to study in college,What is the right major for psychiatry then?
23544,best car racing video game,"Codemasters does this a bit. The Gird and Dirt games (at least the older ones, haven’t played the newest ones) start you out in older, less powerful cars and you race in more amateur-type racing leagues.

Then you buy better class cars and can compete on more advanced leagues.

In the original Grid you also have your own race team, and you attract sponsors as you level up, which lets you edit your livery & it gives you additional objectives for bonus cash.

There’s a similar system in Dirt 4, and you hire different engineers and mechanics too."
10516,best suitcase lock,"I read on a gun forum that someone had the habit of bringing a starter pistol with him when he flew. I thought it was kind of silly until I saw someone check a firearm a few weeks later. They don't fuck around.

I thought it was kind of a nifty idea then."
47437,best state to visit in the United States,"You really have to get in there. People suck no matter where you go, but there are no people if you hike for more than 15 minutes."
21561,best winnie the pooh comic,Probably.
43929,best items under $100,I think you just hit all of my favorite things ever.

33294,best electric car,"That’s wishful thinking but the supply constraints are forecasted to last for years.  But crossing fingers.  Put your reservation in … 120K as of a month ago.  Probably more now:
