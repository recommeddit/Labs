10523,best suitcase lock,"Yes, that's specifically the point of this technique is that, *NO*, they won't rip it open when you're not present. It could land them in some *serious* and real trouble for doing so.

They've already searched the contents while you were present, so they know what's in the bag."

22753,best celebrity,"Working in a magic shop in my 20s, Muhammad Ali came in. My boss (huge Ali fan from back in the day) was visibly staggered. I guess Ali was his idol when he was younger.

Ali hung around for a couple hours, we did some tricks for him, he did some for us (pretty good, too, considering his hands trembled and he didn't talk). He was totally beyond cool with us taking some pictures (he posed my boss punching him in the chin), and wrote a ""thank you"" post card to us a week or so later...

...he signed it ""Cassius Clay, oops, I mean Muhammad Ali"""
4864,best home improvement store,"Ok I thought it was just me, but it's almost impossible to get an employees help at HD or Lowes, and even when you do, you get the feeling that they are just waiting for the convo to end because they are so busy!

Local shops may be the best option"

53371,best usb c charging cable,"> Seems to use the same number of wires, just differently.

Seems they're using thicker(lower AWG size) wires to achieve it I guess:

> * It should also be noted that the cables used to transport the USB 3.1 Gen 2 signals will need to have current, voltage and signal integrity characteristics sufficient to handle and not degrade the USB 3.1 Gen 2 signals. While the USB 3.1 Gen 2 specification supports 10 Gbps communication rates and USB Type C connectors are designed for signal integrity at and beyond those speeds, the length of the cable and quality of the cable construction can both be a factor in limiting communication bandwidth.* - [Source](https://www.cuidevices.com/blog/usb-type-c-and-3-1-gen-2-clarified#optimizing-for-usb-3-1-gen-2)"

25614,best cricket teams of all time,"Thanks! I will write up the method soon. The essential tool in this that is different from the ICC rankings is the use of eigenvalue decomposition rather than updating two teams after a series. So for example, if India beats Australia in a series and Australia goes on to beat England in a series, then this counts as a plus for India as well. There are other differences as well, but I will discuss them in the write up."

5348,best home improvement store,"[us-mattress.com](https://www.us-mattress.com) has very competitive up-front prices online. You can basically find the same model as in any department store or mattress firm for less (mattress brands try to rename them to be scammy, so you have to do your research first). They have stores locally here so it's not a fly-by-night operation."

I was going to get a gas car (Chevy cruze) and drive it till I can get the bolt, but would the spark be a better option?? I don't know much about it so where is the best place to find info?"
72369,best keyboard switches,"Thanks for the feedback.  I feel like I can address many of your points.

1. Buckling spring and Cherry MX Green are fairly similar.  By no means are they exactly alike; unfortunately, it's not too easy to describe the intricate differences in a flowchart.  But there's no question--if you're after a heavy, clicky switch, you're deciding between buckling spring and greens.  If you think it would be cool to own a vintage board, you'll get a heavy/clicky experience from a Model M.  If you want a modern board, you'll have to go with greens.

2. I know that clears are more tactile than browns.  Look carefully--the flowchart specifically states that.  Browns are listed as ""somewhat tactile"" while clears are listed as ""tactile.""

3. I included ergo-clears because they are by far the most common Cherry MX switch mod.  Panda clears and ghetto greens are much less common.

4. Since I limited this flowchart to only the most common switches, I did not list any of Cherry MX's super-heavy switches like Cherry MX Click Grey.  That means actuation forces on this flowchart range from 45g-80g.  On that scale, I consider reds/browns to be light and blues/blacks/clears to be closer to medium.  I think the best argument could be made for blues--they could be listed as light/medium.  I set an upper bound for 80g as ""heavy"" even though they are typically seen as medium since there are switches that are heavier than they are, albeit rare ones.

5. I would have added Topre if I knew better how to describe them, but I've never used Topre.

6. I never said the spring force is increased at the bump.  The spring force increases constantly due to Hooke's law.  I said ""keypress"" force is increased, meaning the force you must apply to the keycap is increased.  Everyone has a different description for how it feels, but I don't think the way I worded it was particularly misleading.

7. Black switches are actually quite unpopular compared to reds.  See the most recent /r/mechanicalkeyboards [survey results.](http://imgur.com/a/dFiBW)"
