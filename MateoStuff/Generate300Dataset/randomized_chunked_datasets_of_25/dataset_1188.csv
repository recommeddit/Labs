Ali hung around for a couple hours, we did some tricks for him, he did some for us (pretty good, too, considering his hands trembled and he didn't talk). He was totally beyond cool with us taking some pictures (he posed my boss punching him in the chin), and wrote a ""thank you"" post card to us a week or so later...

Seems they're using thicker(lower AWG size) wires to achieve it I guess:

While the USB 3.1 Gen 2 specification supports 10 Gbps communication rates and USB Type C connectors are designed for signal integrity at and beyond those speeds, the length of the cable and quality of the cable construction can both be a factor in limiting communication bandwidth.* - [Source](https://www.cuidevices.com/blog/usb-type-c-and-3-1-gen-2-clarified#optimizing-for-usb-3-1-gen-2)",best usb c charging cable

The essential tool in this that is different from the ICC rankings is the use of eigenvalue decomposition rather than updating two teams after a series.

72369,"Thanks for the feedback.  I feel like I can address many of your points.

1. Buckling spring and Cherry MX Green are fairly similar.  By no means are they exactly alike; unfortunately, it's not too easy to describe the intricate differences in a flowchart.  But there's no question--if you're after a heavy, clicky switch, you're deciding between buckling spring and greens.  If you think it would be cool to own a vintage board, you'll get a heavy/clicky experience from a Model M.  If you want a modern board, you'll have to go with greens.

2. I know that clears are more tactile than browns.  Look carefully--the flowchart specifically states that.  Browns are listed as ""somewhat tactile"" while clears are listed as ""tactile.""

3. I included ergo-clears because they are by far the most common Cherry MX switch mod.  Panda clears and ghetto greens are much less common.

4. Since I limited this flowchart to only the most common switches, I did not list any of Cherry MX's super-heavy switches like Cherry MX Click Grey.  That means actuation forces on this flowchart range from 45g-80g.  On that scale, I consider reds/browns to be light and blues/blacks/clears to be closer to medium.  I think the best argument could be made for blues--they could be listed as light/medium.  I set an upper bound for 80g as ""heavy"" even though they are typically seen as medium since there are switches that are heavier than they are, albeit rare ones.

5. I would have added Topre if I knew better how to describe them, but I've never used Topre.

6. I never said the spring force is increased at the bump.  The spring force increases constantly due to Hooke's law.  I said ""keypress"" force is increased, meaning the force you must apply to the keycap is increased.  Everyone has a different description for how it feels, but I don't think the way I worded it was particularly misleading.

7. Black switches are actually quite unpopular compared to reds.  See the most recent /r/mechanicalkeyboards [survey results.](http://imgur.com/a/dFiBW)",best keyboard switches
