Perhaps the movies he is doing interest them more in recent times
"I have 2nd hand knowledge of a TON of Prince stories and they are fucking hilarious.  

Cliff's Notes version of a few gems:

* Shooting a video at a beach in Southern California.  Tide comes in.  Makes a huge deal and demands to ""talk to someone about this.""

* Fires an entire staff for failing to somehow get his little Artist Formerly Known As Prince symbol integrated internationally as a standard key on all computer keyboards.  

* At Paisley Studios, Prince wants to record a song right now.  Engineer goes to plug his keyboard in (musical kind.. not computer kind) and Prince in his impatience proclaims he doesn't need that shit.  Plays the song.  Asks engineer if he got that.  Engineer is like .. well.. no.  ""Why not!?""  'Well because you weren't plugged in""

* I like this one.  Prince calls into the studio from off-site to talk to someone there.  Young guy receptionist asks who's calling.  ""......  the boss of you.""

And many many more..

Edit:  Ok because a few people asked I posted a couple more anecdotes here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1m8w6k/which_well_liked_celebrities_are_really_dicks_in/cc7o2q1"
Do a search on commercial chest freezer. Much more expensive.
An amaretto sour - I can’t taste the alcohol but damn when made properly they are beautiful
"That's not really a relative advantage, since a couple of ""apt-get install ..."" will do the same thing on Ubuntu or Debian."
"They do offer 5-years Masters programs at some schools, so you can get your bachelor's and Masters degree in Accounting within 5 years. But then you'll have to study for the CPA exam after that for up to a year while working, so it's up to you. Depending on your state, too, they may count some of your upper level psychology credits towards the 150 limit (that's what they're doing for me with my old biology credits since I used to be a biology major, now accounting major)."
"That speech is amazing but so is his speech the next day usually referred to as ""the mindless menace of violence"" speech. That and his speech to South Africa is good."
Cracked.
Most definitely!
Give out bootleg candies. Become a legend. Go it.
"I didn't really learn about the Mexican American war until college. What o remember is that the US went to war with Mexico after Texas successfully gained its independence, then it managed to take Texas, NM, Arizona, Nevada, and California from Mexico. I think the war was mainly fought so that the US could gain control of California and Texas."
"My sister lives in the apartment where a dentist used to live, so she gets random free boxes of toothpaste shipped to her every month cause they think the dentist still lives there."
Rice cooker. That fucker kept me fed during depression when I barely had the energy to get out of bed. Takes less than nothing to get some rice in there and flip the switch. Want something sweet? Throw coconut and sugar in there. Want flavor but can’t be fucked to make anything? Get some spanish rice or saffron goin. You can throw tofu in there with it if you need . Yeah it’s not the best for you but hot food is better than no food.
"I've always loved The Forever War because it's barely about fighting and the time travel is mostly used as a vehicle to discuss huge societal changes.

Rendezvous with Rama is going to be referenced by the federal government if an alien object is ever encountered in our solar system. It is so thorough and patient and real. It's not a book I recommend to a lot of people because it's actually kind of dry but I think it is an incredibly realistic look into how we would handle something like that.

&#x200B;

The Stars My Destination is another favorite of mine for societal changes, especially when they discuss the wealthy people and how they showed off. I actually just found that book for 25 cents on campus and read it in a day, I didn't realize it was on that list."
Too many watermarks
New? The bolt EUV. Not selling at the moment though.

Reverse osmosis is amazing! We had one for a salt water fish tank (mixing the purified water with salt). Took our water from 400 to 4 ppm! *FOUR!* That is just crazy.
What about the Xbox has kept you in that family?
"Tbf, it was free for quite a while. I got it for free last year."
Apparently Bloc Party is better than Can. Neat.
"Depending on how fancy you wanna go, I would pick out the iPhone that most appeals to you and just replace the battery when it comes to it. My husband has been using my old iPhone 6S Max for 3 years now (we replaced the battery right before he inherited it as it was already 2 years old) and it’s working perfectly. I have a Xs that I plan to use for another 2 years at least (gonna replace the battery soon to get the most life out of it). I figure 5 years for a device is pretty good! My brother has been using an Android for 8 now but it’s really unable to do much and he fights with it all the time. Not worth the headache IMO. 

I would buy a new (or newish) iPhone with the most storage available, and run it into the ground."
And you're watching the disney channel
