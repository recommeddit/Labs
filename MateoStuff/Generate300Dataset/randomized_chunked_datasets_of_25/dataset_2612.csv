5809,best programming language for web development,"ASP.NET MVC is not ""hipster"" at all; C# is pretty popular in corporate environments and relatively unpopular with the kind of people who would use Node et al."
70313,best major to study in college,I have no regrets studying my career but I really want to go back to school for engineering or chemistry.
612,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902) is your best bet right now. Torguard used to be ok, but it's just going down with the years, really. With Nord I have wayyy higher speeds and better connections. 

I mainly use it for Netflix, movies, torrenting, gaming and basically for everything and everywhere. They have [an offer going right now](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902), too."

45125,best items under $100,Just bought one bade off of the Reddit hype. It does live up to the hype. Cheap and excellent.
60617,Best comedy show on Netflix,I think it depends which season 4 you watch. The original one that requires 200% attention or the re-release they did to appease all the people without an attention span. The second one sucked.
5399,best home improvement store,"if you use RES save or reddit save feature it is a link save under your profile, and any and all updates in the future will be here, but if a link is deleted it also goes dead... lucky for you, i dont delete my posts, however if the OP deletes it, it is gone."
68538,best science fiction novel,">don't think the writing is strong enough for it to qualify for something like that (but then again, people handed The Wheel of Time awards

Foundation has shitty writing and it makes this kind of lists often. It's an awesome story and sets a lot of modern sci-fi tropes but it's not known for its prose."
5785,best programming language for web development,"Front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (as much as I loathe it)

Back end: Ruby on Rails, PHP, MySQL/NoSQL (big data), JavaScript

It all comes together though because a good website will have automated headers/footers which should be done in your back end language of choice. Knowing multiple ones is incredibly useful, especially if you're jumping around projects, but only one is really needed (go Ruby!)."

52099,best iphone case,"This is what I'm using. It looks amazing and fits beautifully but I don't think it would protect much in a ""phone meets concrete"" scenario. I've been fortunate not to drop it yet and it gets lots of compliments so I carry insurance in case that fateful day ever arrives."

55224,best places to hike in the east coast,"As much as I love the mountains of the west, nothing feels quite like the deep ancient forests and mountains of the east.
