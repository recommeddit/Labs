this list hasn’t been updated in ages. most monitors on here have had counterparts that replace the older ones for better prices.
"I doubt strongly that a new hobbyist would be able to understand and enjoy Terraforming Mars. Terraforming Mars isn't a gateway game OR a next step game. It's a solidly middle-weight game, that is long, has some fiddly upkeep, and lots of symbology. 

The first games in the top 20 that I would show a newer gamer would be 7 Wonders Duel, Viticulture, Concordia, and The Castles of Burgundy."

Dude if you’ve ever found anything that’s like Device 6 please lemme know I NEED IT
Monte Cristo is SO GOOD. Get the Robin Buss translation. It's unabridged and is excellent.
"The Week is alright though it's painfully brief, I usually easily read it front to back in one 45min bus journey. However if you just need the basics of the past weeks news to stay informed it's a pretty good buy."
scdkey.com - I got Office Professional Plus for $35. Good luck.
Cheap vodka chased by cranberry or orange juice.
The north of Spain fits pretty good with that description
Just watched “I See You” last night. Just when you think you’ve got the plot figured out it takes a couple hard lefts. Highly reccomend
what..?
"The ""Holy Grail"" would be something with FALD, but those are generally not 1440p. You have the Asus PG35VQ, which is a 1440p ultra wide, but it is a VA and does have some black smear.

Outside of 1440p you have the PG27UQ and the (soon the be released) PG32UQX. Those are quite expensive however (The PG32UQX will be $3k). 

If all of that is too much to bay, then The G7 is probably the best bet of the ""good but under absolute premium"" market."

"My parents are dentists, we use Crest. We also use the stuff that the Australian doctor uses, we use Colgate and Oral B. (We prefer Colgate and Oral B, we just have a shit ton of Crest to use up)."
"No no no no NO no no.

Speaking as someone who works at a public health clinic - you can take as many free condoms as you want from me.

We have different brands, types, styles, etc.

* Extra strength (for when you want to get a little rough)
* Extra sensitive (if you want to have a good cry after)
* Multi-colored (in case you want to make rainbows)
* Tuxedo-style (because everyone looks good in black)
* Extra large
* 'Snug' fit
* Non-latex
* Flavored (banana, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, cola, grape, mint)
* Reality/Female/Insertive condoms
* Dental Dams
* Studded
* Ribbed
* Extra lubricated
* Etc.

Never ever buy condoms unless it's 3 AM and you can't get any anywhere else. And even if it's 3 AM, just go to a gay bar - we throw entire boxes at those places. (Clarification: by 'boxes' I mean 'boxes full of hundreds or thousands of condoms,' not the tiny little box that has like 5 in it)

Walk into my clinic and you can walk out with a year's supply. I've sent people off with grocery bags full."
"I was about to comment after scrolling and did not see Tom Ford mentioned! I am a lady, and cannot get enough of the Oud Wood scent, I use it for myself too."

"The suggestions of oaks and copper beech are excellent. If you want a graceful tree instead of a shade canopy, a dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) is an excellent specimen tree that will also get large."
"I don't think golf is a growth industry (it was shrinking for years until the pandemic)...

...but I like all of your other picks. Nice array of potentially huge new industries in their early innings."

"Stade Rennais. Just kidding, french first league is only exciting to french people.

Well if you don't want to be original, Real Madrid or Barcelona. If you want to do big teams but ""less original"", Bayern, ManCity, Manchester United, Chelsea, PSG, maybe like Juventus, Atletico Madrid."
