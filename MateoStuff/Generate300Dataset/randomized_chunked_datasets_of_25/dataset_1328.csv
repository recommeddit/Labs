11148,"Dell.  Buy a Dell laptop.  Get the free backpack.  Throw away the laptop.

I've had my Dell backpack since about 2001.  Last year I finally gave it to my dad who uses it every day to haul around his big-ass Sony laptop.

Now I use a backpack from whatever company has the Swiss Army logo.  I've been abusing it for about 3 years, with my work-issued Dell laptop when I'm at work.  And when I'm not, I take it hiking and biking (It holds maps, water, etc, really well).  On an average day it holds my 15bazillion pound laptop, accessories, and a bunch of extra stuff (small tools, paracord, etc) that I keep with me.  I throw it in the Jeep for the morning and evening commutes (no sides, no doors, so it gets a LOT of wind abuse).  No problems so far - not even a loose stitch.",best backpack for college

12197,"I remember being a little shit when I was asked what I wanted for Christmas one year and I said ""Scalextric""..come christmas day, super excited, open a big box...and it's not Scalextric. It's a track racing game, sure, but it runs off Batteries and the cars are not F1 cars and i try to be nice to my parents but they can tell I'm not that impressed. 

It was till later on that day I realised that they couldn't afford the 'brand name' thing, so they got me what they could afford. So I made a point of playing with it a lot, making out like it was the best thing ever, just so they didn't feel bad.",best gifts for dad
53225,"I am locking this because of the amount of probably well meaning but harmful recommendation based on the highly scientific ""I plugged it in and it worked"" and ""I have plugged it in _dozens_ of times and still nothing is on fire"" tests. We already have enough good and more than enough bad recomendations, I left comments.

There are brands that are very good at the marketing game and because of that many people buy them and then recommend them based on the tests mentioned above. It's much cheaper to play search engines than certify cables. I actively unrecommend ugreen and startech because of this.

In the future as well, unless you have the (very expensive) equipment and knowledge to properly test cables, stick to recommending USB IF certified cables, you can search for them on https://www.usb.org/products",best usb c charging cable
51137,"It's NME, a UK based magazine focusing on rock music. Of course they're going to put lots of UK based rock acts on their lists. If a music magazine from Ghana put out a list of their ""top albums"" would you complain if their list was all African music? Would you complain if an India based music magazine put out a list full of Indian music? Or a hip-hop magazine putting out a list of all hip-hop music?",best rap album

I've never had a problem with it on any of my projects and despite its lack of support these days (which is true) I'm still using it on the F/E of a production build to handle some pretty modern JWT stuff. It's interceptors make that stuff easy to handle.

That being said, going over this list, `make-fetch-happen` is now on my radar and that's simply too good of a name for me not to look into.",axios alternatives reddit
