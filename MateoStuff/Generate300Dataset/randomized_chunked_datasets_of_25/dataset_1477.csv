10730,best suitcase lock,It's a silent alarm.  We wire up the device inside of a mailpiece so that it will go from beacon mode into alarm mode (audible on our radios) upon opening.
62902,Best Data Science textbook,"OP, so that you know, you mention uncle Bob's ""[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)"", but your link redirects to the book ""Clean Code**r**"". They're both great, but different.

I've ordered the book [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962). Looks great to brush up the basics of statistics and machine learning. Since I haven't actually read it yet, take my input with a grain of salt."
27103,best board games,"I just watched the SU&SD review for terraforming Mars. They weren’t too terribly kind and their complaints seemed reasonable.

9414,best toothpaste,"Because you're supposed to go to the dentist twice a year or once a year (depending on where you're from) anyway. So they're still getting paid.

I'd also like to see people apply this logic to other doctors. ""My cardiologist gets paid for me having a bad heart so why should I take these lifesaving meds!""

Plus most people still aren't flossing. Brushing only does so much, you still have tons of decaying food in between your teeth."

40411,best midrange GPU,"In my experience, the 5700 XT is an *infuriating* card and I can't recommend it. I have done a fresh install of every single driver and 19.12.1 is still the only one that works. Everything since then crashes every few hours, even while watching Netflix."

56116,best action and adventure movie,"On the subject of pirate movies, Cutthroat Island"
34999,best NFL player,Any WR who played before the ”player protection” era is better than today's WRs. It's just a fact if a guy can still make catches and get blown up going over the middle they are a better football player.
46297,best trick or treating candy,">Just make it last

Believe it or not the idea of getting the right amount is giving me anxiety attacks. I want to get enough for kids, but not so much that I'll continue eating the candy for weeks.  

Thanks for your advice!"
