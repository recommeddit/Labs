32494,best vacation resort,"Wow, that resort is at the top of my list right now. That's a crazy coincidence."
73496,best battery bank,"Couldn’t agree more! I’ve got the earlier version of this one, and always bring it with me on trips. It’s incredibly valuable to charge my phone, inreach mini, watch & headlamp in pairs, instead of one at a time."
42283,movies like Inception,Fun fact: It's directed by David Bowie's son.

63708,best books for time management reddit,I just started this last week.  Also cut alcohol consumption to one day a week.
68392,best science fiction novel,"The level of freedom the Drones and Minds had in the Culture series made me look much more critically at other media and how they present their AIs. Star Wars is a huge offender in that regard. In fact the droid L3 in Solo: A Star Wars story was a masterful, refreshing breeze compared to how they treat droids."
1043,best ice cream flavor,Fuck yes. Matcha ice cream is the *SHIT*
17821,best Kardashian,"Kris - Smart, practical, sometimes cringey. 

Khloe - Gorgeous, probably the smartest of sisters. 

Kim - Practical and very controlling sbout showing emotions. I think that it's interesting how high her anxiety is. One would say she's the most confident, but nope. You seldom know what she really feels. 

Kourtney - confident, hate her bio diet lifestyle now because I believe that this particular diet is bulshit. She's the least smart of three Kardashian sisters even though she has a degree. Also no ambitions and lack of discipline. BUT she can be the biggest train wreck which is fun to watch. She and Khloe can throw funny tantrums. 

Kendall - She doesn't care about the show, I think that she's the least charming, interesting and is not cut for reality show - her persona isn't very noticable. BUT you don't need that in modeling and she's pretty, probably kinda smart. I think that she's also the most anxious and reserved. Her and Scott bring the worst out of each other. 

Kylie - My opinions: She is more reserved than people think. She isn't as smart as people think but she isn't stupid. Yes, she is kinda practical but her brand would never make it if she wasn't Jenner and wouldn't have money for starting a company. I wish her well, but she was very lucky with upbringing and I don't think that makes her the best business woman, just... a good one I guess. 

Rob - What the hell. You have so much money, what are you doing? No, seriously, guy needs medication and a good and an intensive therapy. I think that he has some mental issues. 

Bruce - He was so cringey but I started watching Kardashians after the Kaitlyn coming out so I guess I already accepted him as a trans female so it didn't feel creepy. People who watched before the coming out - what did you think about him? 

Scott - I kinda dig him, but he's a trainwreck waiting to happen. He could be a tragic character in a fictive story. I feel sorry for him because he has no siblings or parents. He probably deals with serious issues like addiction and I hope he won't drink again."
35095,best NFL player,"Yeah that's why he's famous lol 

One of the most overrated players ever. Yeah he was athletic as fuck but in the end he was cut short by injury and never amounted to much. He's more famous because of advertising than he ever was as a player."
27276,best stocks to buy,It got acquired by Luckin Coffee. Maybe you missed the news.
11140,best backpack for college,"Weird.  I have [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Maxxum-Swiss-Wenger-Notebook-Backpack/dp/B000BYVA8Q/ref=sr_1_13?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1342647538&sr=1-13&keywords=SwissGear+backpack) from college, and I was going to say, ""This one has waist straps,"" but it doesn't look like it does in the picture.  Mine definitely does.  They must have changed them.

It's a good backpack overall, but kind of annoying that it's so thick.  It doesn't do well on planes (lots of cramming under the seat), and I'm always smacking people with it if I turn around in any sort of crowd while wearing it.  It's really comfortable, though, and it hasn't fallen apart over the past 7 years."

4276,best text editor,"Mm, it's the Vista machines I happen to use on a regular basis (not my own, and I don't have any kind of root access or admin privileges or any of that jazz). I actually have to install it fresh every time onto the desktop, and when I do it acts a bit wonky when it tries to open files. It's unfortunately not worth messing around with -- if I need some serious vim action I just ssh into another machine and use my nice .vimrc environment on BSD or Solaris :D"
