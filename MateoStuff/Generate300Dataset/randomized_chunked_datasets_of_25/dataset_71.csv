51791,best iphone case,"Thanks for sharing!  For my 12 pro I ended up with the [SupCase Unicorn Beetle Clear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HVJTX28/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (quite the name). I like the feel and wanted to be able to see the nice pacific blue phone color.   But, now seeing the Ringke, I think I just might have to try that one out.  Definitely hits all the right (other) buttons."
4418,best text editor,"I switched from vscode back to vim. Somehow the performance of the vscode has gotten a bit worse than it was before. It gets laggy and sometimes even freezes when opening very large workspaces, or when you accidentally open very large file. I was using the vim extension with vscode, but i think it made the performance worse.

You get pretty much same vscode functions and tools out of the vim if you install right plugins and configs."

66775,best soccer team in the world,"Only Trent, Hendo, Foden, Sancho Grealish, Sterling, Kane and maybe Mount are (potentially) world class, most others are just very expensive for being English. France definetly has a better and more valuable pool of players by quite a lot."

38683,best newspapers to read,"True, but in comparison to the Daily Mail they are infallible"
56379,best desktop monitor,"Ehh, not the 3 year panel swap, but that might be a good reason to get it fro. dell.

I got the monitor for $810 CDN total and on Amazon it goes for $1080 with tax and everything.

So I could spend the extra $270 for shipping, but that is a lot of money for a monitor and I'd probably get a 1440p 165hz monitor instead."

3549,best college for research,"things you want! 

when I was researching colleges my list comprised mostly of the best programs for my major then location. 

after I was accepted, since I already knew that each of them had amazing programs for my major I started looking into things I wanted. I wanted a cityish environment, close proximity to a chipotle, maybe a target too, has club lacrosse, study abroad options, outside opportunities for undergrad in the area. 

I did these after I was accepted into my schools to narrow down where to go but you could definitely do this with your current college research"
71842,best movies with a cool twist,"""Good  . . . for . .  you, Marty!"" So very snide."
9186,best toothpaste,"What's the opinon on natural toothpaste like [Tom's](http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/76304/300.jpg)?

Now I know what everyone's thinking but I have zero inclination towards things simply because of a ""natural"" or ""organic label; but regular toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling like it's been violated. I can't stop tonguing my teeth after and everything tastes like crap for the next hour or so."

48366,best color to paint with,Just don't get the water based paint even if it's from the brands mentioned. it oxidizes faster than latex. I'd also look into getting ceiling paint from whatever brand you pick and not just regular white. for for bathrooms use the kitchen and bath paint instead of just regular semi gloss
