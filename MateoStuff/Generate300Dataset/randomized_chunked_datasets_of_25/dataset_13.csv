If Jordyn was my friend, after that whole situation I honestly wouldn’t trust her around my man🤷🏻‍♀️ and it’s not that I don’t trust my man, but it’s still disrespectful to attempt to hook up with him. Travis may be trustworthy, but I would still be upset if I were Kylie if Jordyn made attempts. She ain’t trustworthy after all that.",best Kardashian

46813,"The way the infectious diseases attending put it: ""Ideally, you would wash wish soap and water before and after every patient contact, after every trip to the bathroom, after every contact with something dirty. But for soap and water to be effective, you have to wash for a minimum of ninety seconds."" She went on to demonstrate, via two young medical students and a magical chemical dye, that most people washing even for ninety seconds didn't get every little nook and cranny. ""And nobody washes that long anyway. Not consistently. So I would much rather you just use a little squirt of the hand sanitizer between patient contacts than do such a haphazard job washing all the time.""

Hand sanitizer does work against a full army of microbes. In the hospital, we have to be weary of spore-forming organisms like *C. difficile*, as the spores aren't inactivated by isopropanol and can only be *washed off*, but in most other cases, the little dab's nice. Plus, it dries out your hands much less.",best hand santizer brand
