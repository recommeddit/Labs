23007,best celebrity,I once got a haircut next to Adam Sandler. I was like 11. I said hi and he sort of just glanced at me.

18023,best Kardashian,"And I was just thinking about this: it’s not *just*  that Jordyn messed with her sisters boyfriend. If Jordyn was my friend, after that whole situation I honestly wouldn’t trust her around my man🤷🏻‍♀️ and it’s not that I don’t trust my man, but it’s still disrespectful to attempt to hook up with him. Travis may be trustworthy, but I would still be upset if I were Kylie if Jordyn made attempts. She ain’t trustworthy after all that."

13892,best research paper archive,"The Expensive-Tissue Hypothesis by Leslie Aiello. The actual article [here](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2744104) needs JSTOR access, but she published a very similar paper in the Brazilian Journal of Genetics [here](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-84551997000100023&script=sci_arttext).

71818,best movies with a cool twist,Just watched Bird Box what part did you not see coming?  Reminded me a lot of The Happening?  Did I miss something in the movie?
36942,best roller coaster at six flags,It's just my opinion. It looks like a lot of people really like Wild One but it didn't do much for me. It wasn't terrible but it was rough and didn't excite me. I've only ridden it once though.

46813,best hand santizer brand,"The way the infectious diseases attending put it: ""Ideally, you would wash wish soap and water before and after every patient contact, after every trip to the bathroom, after every contact with something dirty. But for soap and water to be effective, you have to wash for a minimum of ninety seconds."" She went on to demonstrate, via two young medical students and a magical chemical dye, that most people washing even for ninety seconds didn't get every little nook and cranny. ""And nobody washes that long anyway. Not consistently. So I would much rather you just use a little squirt of the hand sanitizer between patient contacts than do such a haphazard job washing all the time.""

Hand sanitizer does work against a full army of microbes. In the hospital, we have to be weary of spore-forming organisms like *C. difficile*, as the spores aren't inactivated by isopropanol and can only be *washed off*, but in most other cases, the little dab's nice. Plus, it dries out your hands much less."
466,best terminal file manager reddit,You can't without re-compiling.
