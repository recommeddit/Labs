13191,best gifts for mom,"I think this totally depends on the person. I thought I'd be like this, but after two babies I've realized that I'm less stressed when I can see the baby, at least first six months or so. If somebody else is holding, I can still relax and enjoy myself."

53662,best medicine for a cold,"Well I believe you can take both ibuprofen and acetaminophen every 6 hours, so I don't know if the 12 hours was just an example? I guess *technically* if you really needed something sooner, the mechanisms are different enough that it wouldn't harm you to take them both. But if you're having pain that's not relieved by the maximum allowed doses of OTC painkillers, that's probably an indication to see a doctor."
37266,best amusement park,"No, cedar point‚Äôs just MiAdventure, but better"
50580,best rap album,"The entire album has too much clipping and really detracts from the experience if you have a good rip of the album and a decent set of headphones and speakers. Just listen to the intro verse from Rick Ross on Monster, that shit clips so bad. Hell I'm listening to it right now and man does it get annoying once you notice it since it happens every two seconds on this track it seems."

13557,best research paper archive,Sci-hub works surprisingly well for that.
27698,best bollywood actor,"Ranbir Kapoor. Hands down - his performances have been great overall (not counting Sanju and a few others of course) and him not being on social media really adds to the mystique. He's the only 'star' from the lot; everyone has used social media and such to add to their brand. This man has built a brand with just his films, and yes some may argue his last name too, although I think he's outgrown that in the recent past. That man is really something."
