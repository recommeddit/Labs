54880,best water filter,"Honestly, I have no clue. We have a lab tech who is in charge of the shared facilities equipment in the room (autoclaves and such) so for the a great deal of science I hope the answer is ""often"". I've always had clean electropherograms on my CE, but come to think of it, we have had some strange results on some PCR's the undergrads have run. Thanks for the tip and I'll check in with the tech at some point about this. I do know that it's flowing way under a liter per min, it's usually a 45 minute~hour ordeal for the undergrads to fill up our 20L holders."

70428,best major to study in college,"If you are talking purely painting, sure, but you can make a good living doing freelance if you are dedicated - one of my friends makes excellent side-income doing nothing but painting in her free time - if she did it full time she'd be well enough off to live off of what she enjoys. 

But there's also art required in games, movie/music/indy posters, marketing copy, sign design, and anything with graphic design. Interior decorating is a common related field that is easy to transition to. 

You do not have to be famous to make a living in art. Look around you - I bet you are surrounded by things that required an artistic eye. Hell, I have a concert mug sitting next to me that didn't design itself."
