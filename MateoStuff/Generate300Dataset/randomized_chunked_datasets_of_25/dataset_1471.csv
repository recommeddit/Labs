67024,">  HAHAHAHA! Oh my god, buddy. Did you seriously just try to turn this into a dick measuring contest?   

YOU did when you asked ""Have you ever been to a Boogie?"" 
I see you DIDN'T answer the questions. I answered yours. Kinda rude.   

>  Answer without the skygod self-jerk. It's weird and cringy. 

You tried to make it a dick measuring contest by asking ""If I had ever been to a boogie?"" 

Like I said, people will disagree, but they will be unable to say why it is safe and instead just claim it is not a big deal... The EXACT thing you did. 

I will wait to see if you ever answer that you have been an LO or have an AFF rating. You won't. Like I said, the best argument you can do is claim it is not that bad - QED.   

The irony of you claiming I made it a contest when your started making accusations first.... I just answered your question. You gonna answer mine?

And yeah, I'll put my skydiving resume up against your any day.... Wanna play? Or you just going to continue to try childish insults and distractions?  

>  Why, then, at summerfest do they have LO's who are dedicated to newer jumpers?   

Because they know low timers will show up. Even if it is a bad idea. It is a better idea to have someone watch over them than let them just run around without a clue and without organization.",best places to skydive in california

1. Small dogs can be high energy too

1. Down to the individual dog, and whatever breed still requires training.

1. Does not exist in nature. My hamster recently skinned me £20 for a 5 minute vet visit!

1. Down to the individual dog, requires training, accidents will *always* happen

1. Down to the individual dog, requires training

Dog's are great, but your life will need to change to fit the dog in. 1 to 2 hours (maybe a lot more!) exercise every single day, rain or shine. First thing in the morning, last thing at night (minimum). Training classes, socialisation etc. Do that and you will have a well behaved, calm companion. If you don't, you will have a poorly behaved, stressed furball going up the walls with frustration.

A dog (any breed) should also never be left alone with a child of that age. Young children often can't read a dog's body language and it only has so many ways of saying ""Back off"" before, well, you work it out.

You are being unrealistic. Getting a dog (or any pet) requires commitment. If you are not prepared to put in the effort, don't get a pet.",best pet for toddlers

For instance it lists the best 60W, best 100W, best 10Gbps, best 20Gbps, best USB-A to C..

45455,"PC 

1) My job is in IT. So I need to be able to log in remotely to my work computer sometimes. So I might as well just overbuild the computer I have for that and also use it for gaming. 

2) Many of my favorite genres are overwhelmingly PC only (Turn based strategy, real time strategy, etc). Whereas my least favorite genre (FPS) seems to be consoles number 1 priority. 

3) I like the selection of indie/early-access games available on PC. The most popular ones often find their way to consoles, but even if I am late to the program and am buying them at the same time they come to console, they are usually heavily discounted for PC by that time.
