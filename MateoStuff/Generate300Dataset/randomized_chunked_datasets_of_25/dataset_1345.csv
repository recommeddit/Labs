6962,best iPhone,">they did the planned obsolescence thing on that device.

How, exactly? The current base iPad is using the same processor as the 7 (A10) and the T2 coprocessors in Macs use cores that were derived from the A10 as well. 

>no real upgrades compared to the 6S

The 7+ was the first iPhone to feature a telephoto lens. This was big at the time because every iPhone before it had only featured a single lens.

How exactly was the 7 ""bad""?"
26584,best board games,"Tellestrations is a scam. Just get paper, cut it up in 4ths, and number all your pieces of paper. It’s all about the laughs anyways. Used to do this in college all the time"

33949,best Pokemon game,"I'll go against the wind and advise the first two generations. With the new graphics I felt like a lot of the magic was gone.

But it may be because I had aged, and I don't like the new Pokemon after 250+ anyway. They look like they have a lot less ""personnality"" and look a lot like each other.  
Also I listen to the music from the first two games regularly, but most of the music from the recent ones is unappealing to me."

2908,best headphones,If you're considering the 990s might as well include the TYGR300 or MMX300 Gen 2 on that list. Never heard these two yet but those who heard them said that both images better than 990s. Plus also not having as much of that ear raping treble.
30846,best country to live in,"I was in Germany (München, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Köln) for the World Cup in 2006. I can easily say it's my favorite place I've ever been to. The idea of ""privacy"" shouldn't scare anyone off, I think it's more of a respect thing. In America everyone is in each other's business. It's incredibly excessive. I think most would find the German (or at least Bavarian) way of life to be refreshing."

25436,best cricket teams of all time,I still think Tendulkar and Kohli (or Richards and Lara) are the best two batsman in this hypothetical. Dravid and Gavaskar would also make the SA team maybe.
