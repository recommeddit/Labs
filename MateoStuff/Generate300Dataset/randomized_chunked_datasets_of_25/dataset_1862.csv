went on a cruise with my dad when I was 16 (divorced family, so full family vacations are a no). One of the stops was Georgetown, Grand Cayman. Dad didn't reserve a rental car because ""there would be plenty left"" there were none left. But what they did have was a scooter.
fast forward 3 hours
dad and I are definitely over max weight on this stupid scooter riding around trying to find a public beach. I decided I had to use the restroom and the closest one was the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. I walk into the restroom and it was all marble. No joke. and I saw a stack of pool towels that were totally for guests and I had the most devious idea (I am my dad's daughter afterall). I grabbed two towels and met my dad outside, when he saw the towels he got the same exact idea. Next thing I know we are lounging by the pool that is literally 20 feet away from the Caribbean Sea and I was sipping a wonderful strawberry daiquiri when an employee offered me a chilled moist towelette. By far the nicest hotel I've ever not stayed at.",best hotel to live in

31903,"I stayed at a monthly hotel in Orlando for around three months. Ask them about monthly rates, they may have them, since you wonâ€™t be the only person living there. However, you MAY still be required to pay weekly anyway. 

One thing to watch out for in long term hotels If youâ€™re on the lower price range is the cleanliness. I had to move three times before I settled in my final room because of bed bugs. When you get into the room, check the creases of the mattress thoroughly since weekly hotels do minimal housekeeping. 

Also have them change the linens after you arrive. Just trust me on that. 

Another thing to be careful of in the lower price range are junkies. They tend to frequent and live in extended stay hotels. Keep your door bolted when inside. When not there hide everything. Use the in room safe. Wear earplugs at night. 

When I stayed it was the Home Suite Home ( not actual suites, just regular ass hotel rooms lol the lies ) and I got a discount for working for the company I worked for so it was 125 USD a week. For normal people it was $150 a week. 

I also stayed in an extended stay for a month in Washington DC. It ended up being about $900. Came with a kitchen but nothing worked and no one wanted to fix it. People doing drugs and deals outside constantly and tricks but it honestly wasnâ€™t bad, they kept to themselves and didnâ€™t bother me. Still a little pricy but clean, no bed bugs!

Your other option which is much better because times are changing - Airbnb. They offer discounts for an entire month most of the time and can be roughly the same price. When I lived in Bangkok for 3 months, I stayed in an Airbnb and it was wonderful. Three months under 800 USD. A little studio with a kitchenette in a decent area near the sky train. 

I never would have stayed at an extended stay hotel if Airbnb had been around. If you can, try that first!",best hotel to live in
