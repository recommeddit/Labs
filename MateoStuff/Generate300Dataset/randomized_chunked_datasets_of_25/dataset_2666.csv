Everything she did was just to annoy me, rather just be left alone, etc. etc.  I'm 21 now and I talk to my mom all the time.

You might get some flowers or a card, but only because it was convenient to pick them up somewhere or someone helped them along.  When they say Happy Mother's Day it's more so that they know they should rather than that they want to.  Don't take it out on them, though ... it's only temporary.  In a few years mom won't be distracting them from the text message; the text messages will be distracting them from mom."
