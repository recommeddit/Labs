But it categorizes your expenses so you can clearly see where you've been spending. You set budgets like ""I want to spend $XXX on grocery this month"" and you can see how you are progressing towards that goal.

I like using it because it is a simple way to see all my transactions and account balances in one place rather than logging on to each separately",best money managing app

42154,"[Donnie Darko] (http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Donnie_Darko/60022315?trkid=2361637) - It's difficult to tell if this fits exactly what you are looking for, but I loved both Inception and Momento, and Donnie Darko is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It is the story of a high schooler who is plagued by strange visions that interrupt his rather quiet life.  Very open to interpretation, I ended up doing quite a bit of outside research to try to figure out more about this story. 

Fight Club [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) - Definitely an excellent movie similar to the ones you've mentioned.  If you haven't seen this yet you should, I won't say much more to avoid giving anything away but it is a great movie.

Both these movies are pretty famous, but they were what first came to mind when I read the OP's description, if you haven't seen these I HIGHLY recommend them.",movies like Inception
