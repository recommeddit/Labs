62038,Best RPG game on PS4,"Disgaea is a fantastic series untill the later games. The direct sequel to the original one on ps4 is probably the best one. After 3 they had too much anime shit for me, but the gameplay is still top notch. I dunno if op would enjoy them since they are srpgs"

29966,best money managing app,"I did my budgeting in a spreadsheet for a few years by the time I downloaded mint, so not for me personally, because I had my savings very controlled at that point.

But it categorizes your expenses so you can clearly see where you've been spending. You set budgets like ""I want to spend $XXX on grocery this month"" and you can see how you are progressing towards that goal.

I like using it because it is a simple way to see all my transactions and account balances in one place rather than logging on to each separately"
525,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"That may work well for, well, signing things, but not for marking up an entire PDF. Especially since it requires I use the trackpad, as apposed to my drawing tablet. Doing things maths with that wouldn’t be feasible."

42154,movies like Inception,"[Donnie Darko] (http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Donnie_Darko/60022315?trkid=2361637) - It's difficult to tell if this fits exactly what you are looking for, but I loved both Inception and Momento, and Donnie Darko is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It is the story of a high schooler who is plagued by strange visions that interrupt his rather quiet life.  Very open to interpretation, I ended up doing quite a bit of outside research to try to figure out more about this story. 

Fight Club [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) - Definitely an excellent movie similar to the ones you've mentioned.  If you haven't seen this yet you should, I won't say much more to avoid giving anything away but it is a great movie.

Both these movies are pretty famous, but they were what first came to mind when I read the OP's description, if you haven't seen these I HIGHLY recommend them."
