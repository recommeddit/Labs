29572,best game console,"There are tons of great console exclusive games and no member of the Master Race should be ashamed in playing them. The real tragedy is that these games are held back by not being on PC. 

Imagine Bayonetta on PC on Ulta. Oh man..."

It is hard to choose my top 10 cuz I pretty much like to watch a lot of anime since I was a child, there are a lot of anime that I want to put as well but One piece, Naruto, Bleach, Gintama, FMA, Mushishi, Natsume yuujinchou, SAO, etc were my precious teenager's memories. I have a lot more that i want to put maybe in top 30/40/50 

I don't particularly obsess with ranks cuz I think each story is perfect in its own way and we will be happier without rankings cuz each person has different value and perspectives

Honorable mention: Vinland Saga, Death Parade, Barakamon, Grand Blue, HxH, Mob Psycho, OPM, Zetsuen no Tempest, Death Note, Fate series, Vivy, Haikyuu, Cowboy Bebop, Asobi Asobase, Kiseijuu, Psycho Pass, Dororo, etc"
33939,best Pokemon game,"I beat Omega Ruby a few months ago and grabbed both Ultra Sun and Y when they were recently on sale. Ultra Sun improves on some things (like TM's) but yeah, way too many cut scenes. I heard positive things about X/Y so I'm looking forward to that one."
68222,best science fiction novel,"I am listing recommendations rather than top five because most of the books listed here are also some of my favorites. 

Carrion Comfort ‚Äî Dan Simmons

This book is a wonderful blend of Sci Fi/Horror about people who can telepathically control people to commit acts of violence, often murder, to live longer. Lots of twists and turns to keep you up at night. Very intense. 

Dreamsnake ‚Äî Vonda N. McCintyre 

Set in a post apocalypse world where the main Character is a female doctor who heals people with three different snakes, but the most important one is killed by accident so she sets on a quest to find a replacement. 

Hothouse ‚Äî Brian Aldiss

A book where the majority of humans on Earth are killed off because of green house gasses. Whats left are plant based humanoids who struggle to survive in a dangerous world overran by deadly vegetation. 

The Einstein Intersection ‚Äî Samuel R. Delany 

This one is hard to explain you should read a synopsis by the author to get a better idea. But also a good read. 

The Gods Themselves ‚Äî Isaac Asimov 

Man searches for alternative clean sustainable energy, but there is cost. Not gonna say anymore,  ( I don‚Äôt want to spoil it) however I highly recommend this one.  Works on the idea of parallel universes.  


Some short reads by HP Lovecraft I recommend if you have not read them yet 

BE WARNED, these may give you night mares haha

The Color Out Of Space ‚Äî Lovecraft

At the Mountains of Maddens ‚Äî Lovecraft

If you saw the movie, ‚ÄúThe Thing‚Äù it was based off this book. 

Cheers!
