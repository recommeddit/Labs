54877,best water filter,I pump Argon through with stirring for about 30 minutes.
72829,best Linux distro,"> basic cli

Only if you volunteer to do so, Ubuntu tries really hard for you not to have to touch the CLI.

If, due to hardware-specific trouble or such, there's workarounds that need CLI in their documentation, it's given as a copy-and-paste magical recipe, not explaining what the commands do.

41143,best instrument to play,"From what I've heard, piano is the best instrument to start with ESPECIALLY if you're planning on picking up anything else. I took 8 years of piano lessons, and when I decided to start playing guitar (and later Ukulele) I had no problems picking it up because I had learned so much theory and everything with my lessons. That's not to say you need the theory - but knowing the basic way of things helps out. If you don't want to start out with that, though, I'd go with guitar. :)"

747,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,"I got some sort of smoothie at a BR some time back, took one sip and knew something was off. My girlfriend tried it too and agreed it tasted kind of fermented. We told the girl who made it and she lifted the little lid on the chiller container with peaches in it and got a really disgusted look on her face and called her manager, who got an equally disgusted and embarrassed look on her face. They offered me different one but I asked for a refund instead because I was starting to feel Ill.

26200,best politician,"Dwight Eisenhower, Robert Taft, Bobby Kennedy.

It's hard not to like Reagan, but he's a unique/peculiar case and hardly a conventional statesman.

Jimmy Carter. One of my role models. A truly great man and a truly great person.

Ron Paul. I have a sentimental affection for the man as he was responsible for upending the way I looked at the world, though I later moved on. An honest man. Complicated; deep. An intriguing figure. Enigmatic despite his openness."
