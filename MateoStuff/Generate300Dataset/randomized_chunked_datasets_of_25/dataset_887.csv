1258,"Bi-rite in SF makes some of my favorite commercial ice cream.

Also Blue Bunny in Texas (which is exported to other places) has the best commercial strawberry ice cream I've ever had.

But I like my own best, preferably made with LN2.  Although a friend's goat cheese with fig jam was good. (Better after I added balsamic vinegar to it.)

Bananas Foster yogurt, with burnt sugar and quite rummy boozy thanks to the LN2 hit...

Blueberry lemon yogurt.

Coconut milk with palm sugar.

Sweet cream with blackberries and macadamias (a favorite at ColdStone when they have the components)

Rose petal jam in plain yogurt.

Honey with white sesame brittle.

Forbidden rice and banana.",best ice cream flavor
58153,"**ACQUA DI GIÒ PROFUMO** by Giorgio Armani. It is very versatile, thus usable in every season and during every occasion. And my female acquaintances love it. The scent is very fresh, harsh, and manly.

&#x200B;

**STRONGER WITH YOU** by Emporio Armani. This is an amazing ""cuddle-cologne"". Though it is not as versatile in terms of all year round, yet a fabulous scent during the fall and winter. But during these seasons you can wear it pretty much during every occasion, especially the one I listed above. The scent itself is very sweet and soft.",best cologne
31436,"Funny. My experience of the Netherlands is that it's VERY expensive, the locals are rude, they will NEVER give a good job to a foreigner (or at least never pay equally), the women are mostly ballbreakers, and there is racism coming out the yazoo. Oh, and my biggest peeve of all, fucking scooters in the bike paths... Avoid.",best country to live in

It's also a good idea to choose either a ""warm"" or a ""cool"" color scheme. Paint specialists are your friends. It's worth spending the time going in to talk to someone at like a Benjamin Moore or somewhere similar because you don't know what you don't know! They can also probably help with the smell question - there might be a formula that helps?",best color to paint with

In my opinion, all these cable reviews are missing very important characteristics, which you could get with a cable tester like in your lab.

It's like if you are on the market for a car. Plenty of articles that will describe the possible colors, the seats of the car, etc. Which is nice, but describing a car ought to include whether it's reliable, what maintenance costs are, the hard stuff.",best usb c charging cable
