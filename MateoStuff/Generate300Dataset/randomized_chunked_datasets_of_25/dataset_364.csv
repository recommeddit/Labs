Giving honorable mention to Duluth and the entire North Shore area also.  

The Soudan Underground Mine is also a unique experience."
13284,best gifts for mom,"Just got my dad to agree to no gifts this year.  I could not be happier about it.  There are no kids in our family; adults exchanging Christmas gifts just seems asinine.  We'll hang out, eat a big meal, talk, and watch our dogs play together."

1769,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Second vote for Gino's, best pizza in town by far. Super cheap too. 
Uncle Rocco's (on state) is also good, a bit more expensive but they have $3 draft fig mountain so there's that"
24841,best spiderman actor,"I think Tom Holland quips the best, which is a non-negligible part of Spidey's character."
41106,best instrument to play,"I think piano would probably be the easiest to start with, although it is a tough cookie to master. The piano provides a visual reference to note positions that make it a lot easier to get to grips with. i.e.... Learning how chords are built from 3+ notes.... differences between major and minor.... chord progressions... It's all easier when you have the visual reference of the black and white keys. 
You can learn guitar chords from a book, and memorize them, but I don't think it really helps with learning how music ""works"" or fits together.  And the weighted keys help add expression to the notes you play, that is quite hard to achieve with a keyboard.
Hope that helps"

I'd like to add that it's not wise to use Admob's mediation.  Banned account = no mediator."
55380,best action and adventure novel series,"I would say Catfishing on CatNet may work for you depending on the sort of SF you want. It's very feel good and found family... while also being pretty action packer near future SF thriller for the most part, if that makes any sense. The premise is basically a group of close internet friends and AI moderator from a cat picture forum, have to come together for the protagonist who is always on the run with her mom from a potentially abusive father (obviously warnings for that element)."

41511,best instrument to play,"As a 25 year + guitarist, and a 2 months old pianist. I say piano! :lol:

Though if you are looking at it as a lifetime pursuit(which you should), no reason why you cant learn both. They are different instruments, but my ability on the guitar definitely isn't a hindrance to learning piano. It's actually very helpful for me. As I've a much much bigger leg up than an absolute beginner(My learning curve is much smaller, as I've a lot of knowledge theory wise that transfers over and finger dexterity from the guitar helps too. Hand independence is very difficult, but i'm just using brute force, stubbornness and time to get over that! :lol: )."

2595,best headphones,"I have a friend that works at an audio store who calls me up before any good deals make it to the shelf. These were NOS, made in Austria. The initial part of my comment was to show that Canadians CAN get deals. My 'sweet spot' was adjusted to based on prices I'd seen in stores for new products.  For example, the Q701 regular price is 189 on US Amazon."

70334,best major to study in college,"Thanks! My university has a dual degree program where as long as you finish the first degree (and nursing pre-reqs) in 3 years, you can transition to their nursing school for a remaining 2, and I got accepted! Currently busting my ass to finish this last semester of my current BS, and it’s not the ABSN or MSN direct entry route, but I’m okay with that since those are faster paced and the MSN option requires knowing more about what field of nursing I’d want a career in."
