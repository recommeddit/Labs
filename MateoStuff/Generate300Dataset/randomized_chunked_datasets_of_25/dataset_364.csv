41106,"I think piano would probably be the easiest to start with, although it is a tough cookie to master. The piano provides a visual reference to note positions that make it a lot easier to get to grips with. i.e.... Learning how chords are built from 3+ notes.... differences between major and minor.... chord progressions... It's all easier when you have the visual reference of the black and white keys. 
You can learn guitar chords from a book, and memorize them, but I don't think it really helps with learning how music ""works"" or fits together.  And the weighted keys help add expression to the notes you play, that is quite hard to achieve with a keyboard.
Hope that helps",best instrument to play

Though if you are looking at it as a lifetime pursuit(which you should), no reason why you cant learn both. They are different instruments, but my ability on the guitar definitely isn't a hindrance to learning piano. It's actually very helpful for me. As I've a much much bigger leg up than an absolute beginner(My learning curve is much smaller, as I've a lot of knowledge theory wise that transfers over and finger dexterity from the guitar helps too. Hand independence is very difficult, but i'm just using brute force, stubbornness and time to get over that! :lol: ).",best instrument to play
