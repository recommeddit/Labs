BORK BORK BORK !!!
Bad people come through every institution.  There's nothing special about Harvard in that respect.
"Neil Patrick Harris. Met him at a show in NYC, and he leaned over a couple times to drop a one-liner. After the show ended, I went to shake his hand, and he hugged me, complete with a full fledged ass grab."
"Ah The Plugs I Met 2 was nice. Forgot about that one.

Lloyd Banks just dropped. Not too shabby."
"Excellent points. I do believe that in a salary cap driven league where it’s harder to hold onto impactful players and winning systems that Tom stands alone. 

He has the rings, personal/franchise records, MVPs, AFC champion and division titles, absurd win/loss ratios especially at home, ridiculous sustained QBR, high level consistency and longevity across a decade and a half, coming back from serious injury, and has managed to separate himself in an era of HOF QBs (both Mannings,  Brees, Rodgers, Favre, Warner etc). 

All this is made more impressive by the fact that he really isn’t that special of an “athlete”. He’s never been the fastest, strongest QB with the most powerful arm. 

Just my humble 2 cents from watching him his entire career"
"If you haven't played Dragon Quest XI on the Switch - well, get it on the Switch because it's got more content, but play that shit. At first it seems like nothing super special, but it sneaks up on you.

The Final Fantasy 7 remake is the most fun I've had playing a game all year, and that's saying a lot. It's not for everyone, so try the demo first because it's a good representation of what the full game is like. But they made a killer combat system.

All the FF games are solid but XII plays a lot like Xenoblade Chronicles if that's your bag."
"Some times they have a 5 pack for $30...regular price is $40, so slightly less. These are the slightly 'better' (supposedly) filters too. How are you getting them for $7 on amazon? All I see is one filter for $9 something, and that's the 'basic' filter."
So look up “Tokyo Tower” ... it’s a tall slender cultivar of Chionanthus. There’s a grower out of Hempstead (Greenleaf) who grows them so I know they’re available around here :)
Jesus
Yep. On netflix by the way. (or it was a few months ago)
"[There's a sequel!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcniyQYFU6M)  

I actually like these versions better since I find the noise they make hilarious too."
"Hubert Horatio Humphrey Jr.  From the [1948 Convention Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nwIdIUVFm4) to being a good soldier as VP under Johnson, Humphrey was well spoken, fighting for the cause as he knew how, and loyal to a fault."

Yeah you're right . I feel black panther is overrated . There are a lot of movies which are way better than this one . I feel  this movie shouldn't have been nominated for Academy awards as the best picture when clearly there were other movies which were way better than this one . ( Just my personal opinion )

"What part of that is system maintenance? 
You get a sane DE with literally 1 command on Arch.
Preinstalled software can be viewed as bloat, as most users won't use 50%+ of the provided packages. 
Managing drivers, kernels, packages from CLI or UI is just a matter of taste and arguably CLI is faster. 
Sorry do disappoint, but you'd have to read wiki every now and then on any distro.
Once again, what of the above is system maintenance?"
"Lucifer's Hammer,
Sirens of Titan,

"Just discovered a veggie black pudding and am literally over the moon, it tastes just the same so I'm pretty happy I can eat this again."
The objective way is that it's considered universally as not only one of the greatest if not greatest hip hop albums of all time but one of the greatest of any genre. I read some of your other posts on hip hop and man do you suck. You don't shit. NOW THERE'S YOUR OBJECTIVITY.
"After trying a lot of calendar apps (Dawn, Timepage, Outlook, iOS default app), still I come back to fantastical. It's the best for me because this provides very nice looking, synthetic view on both my pro and personal schedules. 

Additionally to this, the event input feature is very convenient to use as this supports the natural language.

Last but not least, fantastical's editor just releases a bunch of widgets that are, too, nice looking and effective."

"My dad was adopted and I was the first person he ever met he was blood related to which he would remind me of all the time. I was even born the day before Father's day. One year I made a heart out of that foam paper and cut it in half. He used to commute when I was younger and I gave him one half and I kept the other. He kept it in his wallet and took it all over the world with him until he died two years ago. If anyone asked him, he said his number 1 daughter gave him his heart (I'm also his only daughter.)
Another year I found a tiiiiiny pocket sized version of his favorite book as a kid- The Pokey Little Puppy. He read it to me almost every night as his mom did for him. I gave it to him so when he was away he could read it and not get homesick. He also took it with him everywhere he went. I really miss him."
"Not sure I can whittle it down to five. Here’s a try:

- Dune series (Herbert) - the first four in particular
- Lucifer’s Hammer (Niven and Pournelle) - maybe doesn’t count as sci fi, in which case say Ringworld instead
- Nightfall (Asimov)
- The Cat Who Walks Through Walls (Heinlein)
- Perdido Street Station (Mieville)

So many others!"
Thanks! this book keeps coming and dropping off my radar. I should bite the bullet :)
