32303,best hotel to live in,If you're sneaky you could quietly pull up the carpet and then just paint the entire room with diarrhea.
33800,best Pokemon game,Iâ€™d argue that diamond and pearl actually play slower then RBY.  And that the bugs are exaggerated since the average player wouldnâ€™t even run into any bugs on a RBY play through.  That said they still are objectively the worse.

54152,best medicine for a cold,"Colds are all about symptom management. For each symptom, there is a simple remedy. For nasal congestion, hot soup always clears me out. For sore throat + throat congestion, gargle hot water mixed with saltwater. Vicks vaporub is effective as well as a nice shot of alcohol. Drinky plenty of fluids, consume fruits for essential nutrition, and keep active."

The Gat clears are way too light and Kailh blues too loud (according to others lol). The Gat browns are okay but a little light and not enough bump. Should have the Zealios Friday!"

29513,best game console,"Indeed restrictions are BS. though they can sometimes be limitations of a development cycle (does not excuse AAA titles).

Now that prices are more reasonable the restrictions are becoming less annoying (though still annoying), and I hope people who've wanted to play these games take advantage of that fact.

Edit: Realized you're not only a mod, but the creator of PCMR (It helps to read sidebars eh?), and I was kinda worried this thread would be deleted - which would suck - as even I personally intend to use this list in the future.  Thank you for making me feel better :O"

7253,best iPhone,"From what we've seen so far, it will be an incremental upgrade over the 11. But I will say this, they've been dropping the price of their base model iphone from XR to 11 for example. So, if you can get by on your current phone, wait till the 12 launches. If you want, you can buy the 12 at that time, but the 11 will be even cheaper by then."
