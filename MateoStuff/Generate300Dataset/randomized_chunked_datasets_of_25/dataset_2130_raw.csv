"I agree with /u/provoaggie \- I'm pretty sure the above order is order of thrill or intensity, and NOT the order you should ride it in. The park is basically a large circle. Just do rides in the order of that circle, skipping some if you don't want to ride or don't have time.

Do not assume everything he writes is correct or worth following. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted to hell but that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a block function."
Black Panther had a bigger audience and many believed it had a large social impact
"Fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, bake eggs in muffin tins and store in the refrigerator, etc. But if you are not much of a meal prep person or don't like to cook I would recommend healthy oat bars from the grocery store. I keep them in my purse in case I'm ever running late or forget breakfast. I enjoy the Belvita brand and they have many flavor and texture options."

They're both insanely good pads and my top 2 overall."
