53651,best medicine for a cold,"It blows my mind how few people know this shit. It's really pretty simple. Pharmacies really only sell like six ingredients OTC: acetominophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), DXM (Robitussin), diphenhydramine (Benadryl and most sleeping meds), and guaifenisen (Mucinex). There's some oddballs and equivalents too, particularly in decongestants/inhalers, but almost all common combination meds like NyQuil use some mix of the above ingredients."

My degree had a lot of requirements compared to some of the other degrees and I did 2/3 concentrations. I have a BA in Design with Interior Design and Architectural Design concentrations. I do not regret my degree but I am thinking of going back to school to get an MA in History."

46956,best hand santizer brand,"In most situations you don't want to kill the bacteria on your skin. A healthy skin flora has many health benefits. Using hand sanitizer to strip your skin of this natural layer makes you more prone to infection and is generally unhealthy. There are situations where you want sanitized skin such as having an injury or if you are a surgeon, for example.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora)
Skin flora is usually non-pathogenic, and either commensal (are not harmful to their host) or mutualistic (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient pathogenic organisms from colonizing the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's immune system.[3] However, resident microbes can cause skin diseases and enter the blood system, creating life-threatening diseases, particularly in immunosuppressed people.[3"
