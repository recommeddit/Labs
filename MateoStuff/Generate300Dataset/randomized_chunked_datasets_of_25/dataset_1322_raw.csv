Fav Artist I've Discovered: Foushee or Sinead Harnett"
"Oh man, Santa Clarita Diet had some scenes that were absolute side splitters. The morgue scene was my favorite"
"Well, yes and no. The spring has very little to do with the resistance of the switch. The dome being what gives it the tactile feel that makes it so nice for typing. 

The capacitive nature of it also means you don't have to worry about N-Key Rollover and the likes."
"Yes,  baking soda is less than a dollar.  At least in every grocery store I've ever been in.  Just looked it up and I can get it at Target for 85 cents"
"mobilism usually has them same day or day after release in my experience, at least for regular published books (self-published may take a few days to pop up).. If not there, then IRC. I really can‚Äôt remember the last time I needed to use any of the other sites"
">  I've really pushed away Euro games, worker placement, set collection, etc. games

What the hell's left? ;)"
Dragons Dogma.
"That's like saying don't lock your house or car, they can just break a window.  Or don't like your bike, they can bring a lock cutter. 

A lock is still a good deterrant for someone just checking to see if bags are unzippable/easy access.  Someone stabbing a pen in a bag will be more obvious and take more work.

Locks keep honest people honest. If someone wants something there are ways they can get it regardless of locks."
"I went for a Razer Kiyo because anything worth it's salt from Logitech was sold out or +$50 compared to the Kiyo. I will say the Kiyo goes in and out of stock on the manufacturer's website often, but I have had no complaints. From what I read, it compares well to Logitech models and comes with a built-in ring light, which is a nice bonus. Just offering an alternative!"
">Season 1 of American Crime Story was really good, season 2 is absolutely incredible.

Agreed. Darren Criss was outstanding in S2."
"I think the exact opposite. Tobey has the best Peter, jury's out on best Spidey for Garfield or Holland"
"It's amazing that this is even considered reasonable behavior.

Alcohol is so non dangerous to flights that they serve it on board..."
"I‚Äôve had both, tested both, for movie watching or browsing the matte screen protector was just an eye sore‚Ä¶ Everything has a textured look. 

The writing aspect felt like paper with matte screen protector, but it did not blow the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù out of the water for me to be OK with the loss of screen viewing quality."
"And the main character didn't figure out the secret in the end. He literally said ""every night I went into the cage with fear, not knowing if I will end up in the tank or appear back on the stage"". He thought its 50/50 chance, without knowing that he ALWAYS end up in the tank and drowned!"
"Pep's Barca, specifically in the 10-11 season."
"The most time effective method is checking out Brian Johnson's recaps (called ""philosopher's notes"").  

If you are going to read one, I'd recommend Getting things done.

Ashita no Joe is my no. 1 anime üò¢
"Do it! They fixed the part of the first airtime hill where there was a big jolt, so it‚Äôs absolutely phenomenal! I‚Äôm supposed to be going this Friday morning... before my wedding! XD"
"I loved Parasite, and Incendies and Oldboy have been on my watchlist for a while, so I'll definitely watch those and the rest.  Thanks for the recommendations!"
"Same here -- not a gecko, I just mean that the pets are ours and not the kids'."
"Ditto. He gets angry, he gets annoyed and he yells and curses because he's passionate. He wants these places to be sucessful because at his core he loves being a chef, he loves food, it's a huge part of culture and a good dinner can make a shitty week feel less shitty even for a moment. 

If you're going to talk back to him, ignore him or insult his intelligence or experience as a chef of course he's going to get pissed off. He's straight-forward and blunt so these moments happen a lot when chefs are stubborn. Which is hilarious, sure, he's got a colourful assortment of insults to throw at you. But don't doubt the man's intentions, he's a kind hearted soul."
"If you‚Äôre really into RPGs, you should probabaly get a series x and Gamepass. Microsoft pretty much has all of the western RPG makers now"
"One christmas I gave my mom this little necklace with a small, oval tigerseye and she was over the moon for it and wears it nearly every day. I knew she liked that type of stone, but wow."
"The Dispossessed, by Ursula Le Guin. I don't think any other book shaped my way of thinking as much as this. 

Little Brother, by Cory Doctorow. This is the book I would have loved to read when I was a teenager. Of course it wasn't out then, but still. I love Doctorow's stories because it's never a lone hero that saves the day, it's always a community coming together. Maybe he's not explicitly saying it, but his leftist ideals are well represented in his writing.

Red Mars and Green Mars, by Kim Stanley Robinson. Let's keep with the leftist theme. The Dorsa Brevia declaration is probably the best fictional document ever. And yes, I'm excluding Blue Mars. It was ok, but just take the constitutional congress, add it to Green Mars, then make a small epilogue and it's a huge improvement. 

Anathem, by Neal Stephenson. The whole science monasteries thing is awesome.

A Deepness In The Sky, by Vernor Vinge. Just because of the spiders."
