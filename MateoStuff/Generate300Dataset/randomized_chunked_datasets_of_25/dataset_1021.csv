7061,best iPhone,"I noticed a difference when I first switched to the Xr last year, but quickly adjusted. Still a nice panel, despite the lower resolution."
68407,best science fiction novel,"This is spot on from my experience, as well. Book 4 really needs to be read to get the full experience.

I'd only read these for the first time a couple of years ago, but it's definitely on my short list for a re-read."
47551,best state to visit in the United States,"California. Forget the cities come for the nature. 

We got all kinds of nature. Deserts, rainforests, mountains, beaches. The biggest tree, the oldest tree, shit we got trees you can drive a motor home through. We got some really good trees here. 

Yosemite is here, its beautiful it it's also a fucking zoo during peak season. Big basin is one of my favorite state parks. 

But we have a lot. So get out there and see it."
5324,best home improvement store,"I don’t know how well known it is, but we got our sofa from Joybird and it’s the most comfortable couch ever. We got the Lewis sectional. It’s legitimately like a bed."
3422,best webcamera,"Also depends on your category. So i kinda disagree. 
If you are a just chatting person or a talkshow/podcast streamer i would recommend spending more then 20 bucks on a webcam."
69053,best science fiction novel,"I LOVE grass.  I just started rereading again today, for the 10 or 11th time..."
992,best ice cream flavor,"I read a Doomsday prep guide that said to stock up on saffron, vanilla and cinnamon as they will be extremely valuable commodities in a post-international-trade market. I found it interesting, but can't really imagine that I personally would ever accept it in trade for anything valuable (gas, guns/bullets, canned goods, etc)"
39050,best web browser,"the thing is people here try to act as if their daily driver is their brain child to be frank if you have enough ram then stick to chrome because the fact is till the time chrome controls chromium their is really no hiding from google so use chrome as daily driver and tor for other shit.

if ram usage is a issue than switch to edge chromium its just like chrome but uses less ram but tab sync is still not there

if you want customized browser than switch to firefox or vivaldi.

personally i like vivaldi and use it as my daily driver.

ps:if you are on macOs simply stick to safari"

Claims to filter out even viruses to a size of 15 nanometers."
68329,best science fiction novel,"The subsequent books are about ideas, not about actions or, unfortunately, people.  I just started ""God Emperor"" and I recall being shocked (in a good way) that it starts with something happening.  Not much happens in Messiah or Children..."
3506,best college for research,"Well, in my experience, a bunch of people  think this, specifically at my school. It may not be the same where you live."
31576,best hotel to live in,"Couer des Alpes in Zermatt, Switzerland. Excellent hotel and the view from the pool is nothing short of amazing. I'll let this picture do the talking -  [https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/89/f0/11/terrasse.jpg](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/89/f0/11/terrasse.jpg)"
4575,best text editor,"Emacs, I've used emacsen since 1982, since around 1987 mostly GNU Emacs.

Compared to e.g. vi/vim it's ""mode free"" regarding input versus control. That is, you are all the time in ""insert mode"" and perform the commands with Ctrl-keys. The basic Ctrl-keys are the same as the default editing keys in bash. It is easily programmed using emacs lisp, where the original Multics emacs I used was programmed in MacLisp (has nothing with Mac to do), and it has several types of macros, that is recording your key strikes to repeat the same thing over and over, and a macro can be compiled to a lisp function.

It can be used in ""server mode"" which implies that you only need to have one instance of the editor running despite you open it from the command line in different terminal windows.

Regarding python, I consider it not ideal, as by default a program line, due to python's white space syntax is not unambiguous, will be reindented when it's ambiguous when pressing TAB. Therefore I've hacked both the python mode somewhat as well as my style of python programming, by introducing a [""safe"" block structure, like this](https://imgur.com/Xv2UyvJ). Regarding the other editor Geany, you mentioned, I don't know it at all, and regarding vim, I only know that I don't like it, I basically know only one command, how to exit the editor."

29878,best money managing app,"I would use YNAB if it were free personally, but I prefer my handy self-made spreadsheet. It involves a little bit of manual input, but it tracks and offers the same functions any other app would."

38310,best newspapers to read,"Seriously, they're incredibly insensitive."
14702,best romantic novel,"Love In The Time Of Cholera.

One if the best books I've ever read, and my usual fare is sci fi and high fantasy. It makes you feel the life-filling power of love in its many different faces."
29769,best money managing app,"I'll add another vote for YNAB.  I started using it earlier this year when I found out I was being laid off and it has really helped me feel more secure and in control with the reduced income.  I've always saved ""enough"" for retirement and long term/big expenses so I wasn't worried about not having an income, but I've indulged in some excessive lifestyle creep over the last few years, and YNAB inspired me to actively work against riding the credit card float and take better care of my disposable income.  

The upfront $50/year cost made me wary, but in the first month of using it for free, after taking a REAL look at my expenses, I found an easy way to cut $55/mo out of my expenses, and did it the day after I set up my budget in YNAB.  So I saved enough in my free month to cover the subscription cost for a year, and will save another 12x that over the year from that one, single, simple change.   Between that one realization and several other small changes that have helped me focus on my actual priorities rather than spending mindlessly just because I can, I will be off the float within 1-2 more months."
