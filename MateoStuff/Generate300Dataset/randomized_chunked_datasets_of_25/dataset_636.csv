32359,"Can confirm this. The truly rich and famous are in fact rarely ever the ones who make a fuss of their status and can be some of the most polite and sensible ones. It's the influencers who are clawing for deference. This was a few years back but of the many stars who have stayed at one of my hotels,, the most memorable was Lady Gaga. 

When fans found out where she was staying they flocked over to the hotel hoping for a glimpse of her or to get her autograph, but as you can imagine when the crowd gets too big it can cause operational headaches. Gaga was very aware of this and took initiative to manage her little monsters, as she calls them. She tweeted and asked her fans to be good and kept them under control. Even ordered pizza from the hotel kitchen for all of them waiting outside in the driveway. We couldn't have asked for a more considerate guest of her stature. In the words of my GM (general manager) she is ""incredibly switched on"".",best hotel to live in

62941,"[Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) \- I was initially skeptical of its content (seemed like a cookbook) but as an applied text (with a pretty strong theory reference list) it goes a long way in explaining how to actually implement ML and DL with modern packages. I think its a particularly strong companion text to the more theoretical tomes like [Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) and [Goodfellow](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) if you're starting out (Helps that it's updated for TF2.0 and was completely free a couple of weeks ago).",Best Data Science textbook
