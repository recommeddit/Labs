65051,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Get out more?
61784,Best RPG game on PS4,"I second this. I'm almost 40 hours into it, and only about half way I think. I've barely scraped the side quests too, and it is so amazing. One of those worlds that sucks you in and captivates, and I haven't felt like this since Harry Potter."
10844,best suitcase lock,Last time I flew I found a little note in my bag that said the TSA had checked it.
9442,best toothpaste,Ha
33648,best electric car,If you can find one. Kia plans to sell only a few hundred ev niros. I'd be shocked if they mass produce the ev soul.
9110,best toothpaste,You didn't buy the whitening kind did you? Because someone I know was told by her dentist that the whitening ingredients weaken the enamel. Why they would put those things into a toothpaste intended to strengthen enamel beats me.
60922,Best comedy show on Netflix,Several times!
32359,best hotel to live in,"Can confirm this. The truly rich and famous are in fact rarely ever the ones who make a fuss of their status and can be some of the most polite and sensible ones. It's the influencers who are clawing for deference. This was a few years back but of the many stars who have stayed at one of my hotels,, the most memorable was Lady Gaga. 

When fans found out where she was staying they flocked over to the hotel hoping for a glimpse of her or to get her autograph, but as you can imagine when the crowd gets too big it can cause operational headaches. Gaga was very aware of this and took initiative to manage her little monsters, as she calls them. She tweeted and asked her fans to be good and kept them under control. Even ordered pizza from the hotel kitchen for all of them waiting outside in the driveway. We couldn't have asked for a more considerate guest of her stature. In the words of my GM (general manager) she is ""incredibly switched on""."
68080,best science fiction novel,"The Man who Folded himself by David Gerrold deserves an honorary mention, imho. That book (really, only a long short story of about 170 pages) really made my head smoke."
61663,Best RPG game on PS4,"Definitely recommend persona 5.

Also ""Tales of"" franchise is great.

Edit: dragon quest xi 

Also recommend soulsborne games.

Beside that can't remember anything else. Maybe someone will add more"
59493,best perfume,He's a Seer! Witchcraft!
12077,best gifts for dad,I think technically that would make him the prostitute.
56308,best desktop monitor,"I love love love the razer monitor I bought and it's the best I ever had in terms of overall quality, value for money, performance and style. I absolutely adore it, and I have much more expensive unite before but still I would not trade it for any of them.  Also for me 27"" is just the sweet spot imo for single player games and also for general productivity for me at least.

edit: not sure if i am allowed to post amazon links, the exact model is the number 1 on this list: https://digitalaquarius.com/best-gaming-monitors-reviews/"
36357,best alcoholic drink,Tequila: espolon or dulce vida
32920,best energy drink,I just meant that would make it easier on your body
51135,best rap album,"I'm not saying I entirely disagree with you. I wish that the list could have had a wider variety of genres in higher positions myself. But I guess I was just expecting something a lot more homogenous than what actually came out, and for that reason I'm somewhat satisfied."
43074,best detective show,I thought it was magnificent.  I regard season 1 as being the single best American murder mystery ever made.
5844,best programming language for web development,"Can I make advanced web applications in js? for example web scraping and then using the data the way I want, making user accounts, databases, etc"
62941,Best Data Science textbook,"[Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) \- I was initially skeptical of its content (seemed like a cookbook) but as an applied text (with a pretty strong theory reference list) it goes a long way in explaining how to actually implement ML and DL with modern packages. I think its a particularly strong companion text to the more theoretical tomes like [Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) and [Goodfellow](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) if you're starting out (Helps that it's updated for TF2.0 and was completely free a couple of weeks ago)."
36512,best alcoholic drink,Have you tried that methanol shit? I've heard it's a real kicker!
72916,best Linux distro,Kali is not a distro that you install and use as your OS. It's meant to be loaded in VM or from USB stick to do your dirty things and wiping it as soon as it's not needed.
921,best desk lamp,This seems pretty sturdy http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sketchydesignstudio/andromeda-tactical-lighting
69246,best major to study in college,"You're killing me smalls! That sounds awesome. 

Are you commercial or residential?"
29544,best game console,"Vanilla experience was better on console, but mods did fix the issues.  I guess if you don't want to monkey with mods it'd be better, but I still think those mods made the PC experience better personally."
52511,best hiphop album,"Illmatic, madvillainy, the money store"
