"Wait this lineup doesn't make much sense. Younis Khan obviously for Hafeez, Hanif Mohd for Yousuf (actual opener) and Miandad definitely stays but not as WK!! Wasim Bari should come in for ~~Malik~~ Malik^TheFixer.

Edit: Also, could I just LOL at you thinking you needed to justify picking *Imran* over Afridi? I mean sure, one's only *easily* the greatest cricketer Pakistan has ever produced, while the other played all of 20 odd Tests with a so so record, but yea, tough choice."
I couldn't more highly recommend Ender's Shadow if you're looking to get back into the series. Best book of the Ender or Shadow lines imo
Any cheaper options?
I just stopped wearing contact lenses so I have prescription sunglasses that are the same frames as my regular ones right now. I'm looking for a new pair but haven't found any frames that I really like yet.
I meant wireless headsets obviously though many Wireless headsets are Bluetooth.
"The only fancy feature you might want is it ""beeping"" every 30 seconds so you evenly brush each quadrant over the 2 minute total brush time, but I'm pretty sure that's on every model now"
"Yes, I have used an app called droidcam to use my phone as a webcam. I used a selfie stick/phone tripod to mount it. Works pretty well!"
"I have Disney and SWO/BGT passes, I'm not into Universal at all.  Outside the HP areas, which are awesome, Universal is lacking.  AK takes theming to an entirely new level. Plus AK food >>> anything at Universal."
"I agree with you completely, but it's

How much was your PC if you don’t mind me asking? I’m trying to make the jump from console and would love to do it as inexpensively as possible
"I have the LG27GL83a, it's an excellent monitor with two exceptions. 1.) You can't pan the screen horizontally. It can tilt up/down and be raised/lowered, but can't adjust left/right. 2.) The standard base takes up a lot of space. I'm strongly considering getting a VESA mount off the back of my desk to free up the desk space.

Otherwise, colors look good, response time is good, it's g-sync compatible for Nvidia cards, and it's a reasonable price."
"Behind every philosophy major there is a parent saying ""sometimes you just have to let kids make their own mistakes"""
I think this shows how competitive the last decade has been. w/l don't mean shit unless above 2.
Baking soda is an abrasive.
"Cool, never been that high up the east coast :)"
Keep an eye out for Hotpoint and some GE. I've noticed the same manufacturing quality getting shifted over and anything with the R600 compressor is having catastrophic failures.
"Same here, Philippines yo"
"NFS Heat has really good customization, especially if you download Heat+ you can do  some crazy (unrealistic) engine swaps."

"Firefox has extensions on Android, and has end to end encrypted sync across desktop and mobile. It also has exclusive features like containers (login to the same site with different credentials)."

What are you saving your RAM for?
"Thank you, my favorite as well. I also like that Voss comes in glass bottles so no plastic aftertaste. I really notice a better taste than Fiji."
"I'm not going to lie, I'm a broke college student. So I'll give you my list of publications that are free that I constantly read/listen to:

\- The Associated Press, Reuters (wire)

\- ProPublica, The Intercept, WhoWhatWhy (investigations & independent)

\- Democracy Now!

\- NPR

I'm into a lot of investigations, independent news, and wire services because I don't like partisan news. These independent news organizations usually are ""close to bias-free,"" because there isn't a political party that they're supporting. It's just straight reporting.

I was able to get a free subscription to the NYTimes as well because I'm a college student, so if you're a college student, look into that.

I also read my local newspaper, but like someone else said, I work for them, so I get it for free."
