"Empty Bowl inside the SB public market. Try the Northern Thailand Curry Noodle ""KHOA SOI""."
Toscana for traditional Italian style pizzas! It’s in Solvang though. All the food there is worth the drive.
It’s also Nolan
The Polybius video was really well done

"Sure but they get none of it until they agree to be partners. Aka buy our protection or we will beat you and take your money, classic model"
It's not on Netflix.
"Here here, Google Fi kicks ass. I worked as a field biologist for a while and it got great service in a bunch of remote areas in the bay area that I never expected (and my ATT work phone didn't). The hassle free international service is amazing, too. Spain, Morocco, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Japan... Didn't have to do a damn thing for my phone to work in those counties. Landed and got going."
"I use Iriun Webcam with my phone,through the usb port.It works perfectly.Its very good.And its basically free,because i have a phone anyway and will always have and the worst phones have at least a 1080p camera its great."
"Same here but then for the ""education"" category. Particularly the combination of the US being 5, South Korea being 7 and The Netherlands, Sweden and Germany being 11, 12 and 15."
Ha ha ha! Great! And I want to know more about the remedy for a sore throat
There are literally three comments and none mention Leicester
"Forza Motorsport 4 should be up there. It's the only reason I still have my 360. It isn't the most realistic racing game, but it's easy to learn and very fun.

"Yes but strangely not brothers or cousins. A strange phenomenon indeed…

Edit: this was playful banter. It is not an insult… read it again!"
Can't go wrong with a Jamie & ginger!
I really didn’t see the ending coming.
"Best- Infinity War, Winter Soldier

Worst- Hulk (2003) and Captain Marvel"
Isn't that more like the hien in terms of speed?
I got my law degree from some shady online college. I got fired and now I go to a community college with some loveable misfits.
I feel the same although relapse and bad meets evil were pretty solid albums
It makes sense but I would say not just saving money but time. The ability to jump right into a game on an iPad is another selling point. Not that XBOX or PlayStation takes hours but it does take longer. This is definitely more pick up and play.
"Burberry London

Or if you want to be more exclusive, check out www.galimard.com. They are based in grasse, they have greatly made perfumes at a reasonable price. My favorite is 1747."
"No, I only read it I still haven't  *heard* it lol"
"Agreed, Aquafina is actually purified while Dasani is ""remineralized"" of all things"
How is the score related to the size? Do you do logarithms or surface area of the circle?
