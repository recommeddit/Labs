24084,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood - Mentioned lots on here already but like many others I consider it to be the greatest anime series ever produced.

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 1st GIG - It’s a tough call between the 1st GIG and the 2nd GIG their both superb, I think the storyline is a little tighter in the first series though and that’s what wins it a spot in my list.

Cowboy Bebop – The first series I ever watched and the one that’s started my addition. Slick savvy and very very cool

Kill la Kill – Spectacular, over the top, and great fun.

Spirited Away – Any anime list wouldn’t be complete without a Gibli film on it and I consider this one the best the best one they’ve made.

Redline – It’s not smart and it’s not clever but it’s a hellova rush and seriously pretty. Probably the film I’ve watched the most as its just pure fun without being overburdened with complexities like plot.",best anime

I have an Asus Rog Strix GL502VT and have loved it for 5 years. This baby is starting to fail unfortunately but I know all good things must come to an end... Nevertheless, I am looking for a good upgrade. Looking for something that can play modern games and can also run engineering softwares (Ansys, SoldiWorks, Catia and more).

9874,"Ah, these batteries are normally usb a to usb c for charging a device and vice versa. I don't know if there are USB C to USB C for charging. I don't think this is causing the charging speed issue. I have had the charging slowly issue with rapid charging wall chargers lately (i'm having it now actually). I have to reset the phone for it to charge at fast speed, and even then it doesn't always work. This should be the same with the charger. I haven't checked if I have the problem with my portable xiaomi battery. This seems to be an issue thats happening since the upgrade to Pie. Try resetting it then plugging it in again and see if it states that its charging rapidly.",best portable charger
