70940,best movies with a cool twist,I think it was called ID with John Cusack - messed me up
40933,best instrument to play,"Why are tabs a no no If theory is the focus? I'm sorta in the stage of ""ive learned all the open and barre chords on guitar and now I want to branch into more theory stuff"" on guitar, and I use tabs pretty often, so Im just wondering."
30891,best country to live in,"Where do you live that you get such long waiting lists?? Im in Hull at the moment, supposedly a shit hole and I got a dentist appointment as soon as I wanted one, GP normally 2 days etc"
33505,best electric car,Try for a Vanderhall Edison instead.
56358,best desktop monitor,"Trust me, you will just stay on your desktop moving windows to indulge the smooth screen. I have 2 pc's, 1080p and 4K gaming, and my 4K monitor is 60hz whilst my 1080p is 165hz. Honestly, I appreciate high refresh rate more than the higher resolution."
29978,best money managing app,"I'm glad we can all agree that regardless, it is all on the individual to make good financial decisions. With all the knowledge and tools, one still must decide to put them into action.

Edit: Happy Cake Day, friend."
24084,best anime,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood - Mentioned lots on here already but like many others I consider it to be the greatest anime series ever produced.

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 1st GIG - It’s a tough call between the 1st GIG and the 2nd GIG their both superb, I think the storyline is a little tighter in the first series though and that’s what wins it a spot in my list.

Cowboy Bebop – The first series I ever watched and the one that’s started my addition. Slick savvy and very very cool

Kill la Kill – Spectacular, over the top, and great fun.

Spirited Away – Any anime list wouldn’t be complete without a Gibli film on it and I consider this one the best the best one they’ve made.

Redline – It’s not smart and it’s not clever but it’s a hellova rush and seriously pretty. Probably the film I’ve watched the most as its just pure fun without being overburdened with complexities like plot."
35508,best alcoholic drink,Vernors is the greatest.
28673,best breakfast foods,You forgot the mushrooms.
65755,best college in california,I really hope my family doesn't see this.  We went to basically all of these schools and the rivalry is strong.  Especially with Cal/USC.
56723,best desktop monitor,"I have the same one, only a 27 inch. Good monitor, Good quality, haven't noticed any dead pixels in the almost 2 years I've owned it. Ports on the rear are nice and tight. Only complaint is the mount, she wobbles if you hit the desk or anything, nothing crazy and nothing that should be a deal breaker, just full disclosure here."
36650,best alcoholic drink,I’m also a fan of pineapple vodkas!
66340,best soccer team in the world,"but then again, nobody uses this as a metric for a reaseon. Or are you suggesting really that Arsenal is a better european club with simply one CWC then the next three clubs from the table that have respectively 3, 1 and 3 again champions leagues(and i'm not even counting the other cups)?"
62937,Best Data Science textbook,Thank you for the recommendations!
56590,best desktop monitor,"Yes, i saw a Hp elite 27' 1400p monitor at a friend and it made me want to upgrade my Dell 2412h 1200p 24'. 

It's a very noticable upgrade. Personally now i see the screendoor effect at an arm's lengh viewing distance.

Testing a 4k+ 8k video on youtube made me open my mouth. (contrast made a big punch too) ."
53613,best medicine for a cold,Agreed! I get these horrible stomach pains which feels like a burning sensation/I haven’t eaten in days when I took mucinex!
7438,best laptop for general use,"Hello, first of all thank you for your encyclopedic knowledge and suggestions!

I have an Asus Rog Strix GL502VT and have loved it for 5 years. This baby is starting to fail unfortunately but I know all good things must come to an end... Nevertheless, I am looking for a good upgrade. Looking for something that can play modern games and can also run engineering softwares (Ansys, SoldiWorks, Catia and more). Budget is equal/less than $3k, battery life is not too important, backpack life is king. 

Merci beaucoup!"

9874,best portable charger,"Ah, these batteries are normally usb a to usb c for charging a device and vice versa. I don't know if there are USB C to USB C for charging. I don't think this is causing the charging speed issue. I have had the charging slowly issue with rapid charging wall chargers lately (i'm having it now actually). I have to reset the phone for it to charge at fast speed, and even then it doesn't always work. This should be the same with the charger. I haven't checked if I have the problem with my portable xiaomi battery. This seems to be an issue thats happening since the upgrade to Pie. Try resetting it then plugging it in again and see if it states that its charging rapidly."
