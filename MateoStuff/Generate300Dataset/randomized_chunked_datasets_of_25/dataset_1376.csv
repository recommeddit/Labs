TBF I actually don’t mind BlueHost but it hasn’t given me what I need or want, and I’ll be switching back to SiteGround once my 3 months are up. I know, I’m an idiot.",best web hosting service

68417,"I don't know that I can get behind ""greatest work of science fiction ever written"" but those four books definitely return to the forefront of my mind multiple times per year, probably multiple times per month - that's much more often than many of the accepted classics do (I almost never really return to thinking about *Foundation* for example).  


Sure, the intricate layers of the story and the way it reads as an entirely different sort of novel by the end are critical features, but I think people overlook  Wolfe's talents as a prose stylist - this is probably part of what the above Redditor was getting at with the highlight feature. Wolfe has a way of making the interplay of the words themselves captivating to me. Really I can only think of Mieville and Catling as his contemporaries there (hell, maybe McCarthy is a more apt comparison), but I'd love to find a few more writers in that vein.",best science fiction novel

This provides a bridge for such people.",best spreadsheet editor
