Actually, that makes sense.  Luke later has the force-conversation with Vader ""Father.""  ""Son.""  ""Ben, why didn't you tell me?"", which wouldn't be possible if he didn't know."
"Yeah that's why it was kinda funny, she was definitely bottom of the bill, I didn't even know she was still making music."

"Ceasar's conquest of Gaul and the civil war against Pompey was incredible and it has been studied by most military generals to this day including Napoleon, Hitler and Patton. The month of July was named after his clan (the julii, hence his name Julius) and the terms Kaiser and Tsar were both derived from the name of Ceasar. Truly an epic dude."
