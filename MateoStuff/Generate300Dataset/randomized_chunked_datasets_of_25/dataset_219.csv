Jerry Doyle (Michael Garibaldi - Babylon 5) and I chatted for a few minutes while smoking.  Extremely down to earth guy that was cool talking with anyone.  He didn't seem like a 'star'; more like just some nice guy.

Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy - Harry Potter) was jammed in an elevator with us.  At Dragoncon, the elevators take forever.  He was actually making a beer run for some party and he seemed super nice to everyone.",best celebrity
47711,"Mississippi. Depending on your interests there are several things to see here. You could go through the delta and see the MS Blues Trail, visit Tupelo and see the birthplace of Elvis (I actually live in Tupelo and have only seen it once), the cemetery in Columbus where they took flowers to the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers every year and eventually it became Memorial Day, Vicksburg National Military Park, Rowan Oak in Oxford. The more I type out the more I think that you need to either be interested in history or music to enjoy most of MS attractions. But, if you're interested in those things you could have have a fun couple of days in the state. There are several more things to see, I'm just drawing a blank on most of it.",best state to visit in the United States

16072,"American Optical's Original Pilot sunglasses are fantastic. They still make glass lenses, but I'd opt for the polarized polycarbon‚Äãate. And while I know it's not authentic, I didn't get the bayonet temples - I find them uncomfortable.

The other brand I like is Electric - I have a pair of Electric Swingarms that I like a lot.
