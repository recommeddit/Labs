64748,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Dude's from NYC. Probably should not be recommending deli sandwiches to him.
1438,best ice cream flavor,Tylenol
22202,best celebrity,"Probably a toss up between two guys I met at Dragoncon.

Jerry Doyle (Michael Garibaldi - Babylon 5) and I chatted for a few minutes while smoking.  Extremely down to earth guy that was cool talking with anyone.  He didn't seem like a 'star'; more like just some nice guy.

Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy - Harry Potter) was jammed in an elevator with us.  At Dragoncon, the elevators take forever.  He was actually making a beer run for some party and he seemed super nice to everyone."
47711,best state to visit in the United States,"Mississippi. Depending on your interests there are several things to see here. You could go through the delta and see the MS Blues Trail, visit Tupelo and see the birthplace of Elvis (I actually live in Tupelo and have only seen it once), the cemetery in Columbus where they took flowers to the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers every year and eventually it became Memorial Day, Vicksburg National Military Park, Rowan Oak in Oxford. The more I type out the more I think that you need to either be interested in history or music to enjoy most of MS attractions. But, if you're interested in those things you could have have a fun couple of days in the state. There are several more things to see, I'm just drawing a blank on most of it."

58435,best cologne,chloroform?
27255,best stocks to buy,"üòÇ good point, it‚Äôs just I see posts like this and people attempt to pump all kinds of trash they have no interest in holding a week never mind a year. It really annoys me so I wanted to make the point clear. I don‚Äôt do pumps, well researched plays with entry and exit strategies is my game."
998,best ice cream flavor,"I'm not even sure why people stock up on gold  for similar scenarios. I would much prefer to be sitting on a mountain of stored food and medicine, fertile land with a stream, and security enhancing tools such as firearms, reloading presses and fences."
11986,best gifts for dad,Peace and fucking quiet
13693,best research paper archive,"Do you have any friends who are faculty/staff/students at a university? Maybe they'd let you use their library/journal access.

If you can sign up for researchgate.net or academia.edu, some people share research there. Otherwise, people will often share articles with you directly if you email them."
16072,best sunglasses for fashion,"American Optical's Original Pilot sunglasses are fantastic. They still make glass lenses, but I'd opt for the polarized polycarbon‚Äãate. And while I know it's not authentic, I didn't get the bayonet temples - I find them uncomfortable.

The other brand I like is Electric - I have a pair of Electric Swingarms that I like a lot.

44360,best items under $100,The one thing I FUCKING HATE about living in Canada: shopping online. Go to checkout... Free two-day delivery! Oh you live in Canada? Well that'll be three weeks and with an added delivery fee of $45.
19897,best workout music,The Muscle Up Rap - its a real rap by cali /bodyweight stars on iTunes ... it pumps and grinds.

35008,best NFL player,Jim Brown blew your mind?
43333,best ad service for mobile applications,"I have same issue. No ads just state that admob is reviewing activity. They did this to me a year ago. I do not do anything shady, just make simple apps. There is no way to contact admob and find status either."

21929,best celebrity,"He visited my best friend's nephew on the burn unit when nephew was 8. Nephew nearly died, had 2nd and 3rd degree burns over 80% of his body. LL Cool J visited and kept in touch for a while after.

Not my style of music, at all, but I will always be a fan of the person he is."

56683,best desktop monitor,What GPU and CPU do you have?
35329,best alcoholic drink,"This man drinks. I‚Äôm the same way. Really, really dive spots call for a gin and tonic. Well. Short glass. Feel the burn. They have a bunch of run down Chinese restaurants that turn into dive bars in Seattle and I would get fucking trashed for $20 bucks and would leave with delicious Chinese food for the evening. Miss that city."
36948,best roller coaster at six flags,Wild One (but I‚Äôm biased- it was my first coaster).
3051,best webcamera,I feel like I‚Äôd being doing an injustice to you if I didn‚Äôt tell you. It‚Äôs ‚Äúto each his own‚Äù as in each deserves his own opinion.
