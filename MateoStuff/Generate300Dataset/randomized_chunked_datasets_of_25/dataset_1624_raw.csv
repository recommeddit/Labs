I love just sucking on those minty dental floss.
"It's fine to check your box as well. Just include a firearm in the box. 

If you're checking firearms, TSA requires that the box and contents be checked with you present, then locked up with a non-TSA lock. Basically a box with guns is about the only case where they'll care that your property won't be ""misplaced"" after it goes down the conveyor."
"It seems almost cliche now, but people lost their shit when The Crying Game came out. I remember ads specifically warning people who had seen it not to ruin it for others."

Surprises me that no one has though of this before.
I took them on a 10k shakeout yesterday felt smooth the whole time!
Can someone please summarize this without the math language?  I have not been in a math classroom for 10 years and the variables and equations are escaping me.  I've been googling all day and I dont' want to spend an hour trying to get a 2 sentence summary out of this.
"The other thing to note however, is that Rice didn't have as much WR competition the way other HoF's had (Moss + Carter, Fitzgerald + Boldin, etc).

Every WR had a unique situation that affected their stats one way or another. For instance, Fitzgerald certainly didn't benefit from having an extremely low caliber of QBs for the majority of his career.

Do you have any articles about the worse QB equating to better stats for a WR? I'd love to know more about that!~"
Plenty of access. Live in Australia. Have just heard horrible things about the health are system in America so I was surprised to see it so high.
I love that song!
Wait holy shit I've been doing exactly this lately. Where are the cameras.

"Outremer can be found for very little.  Great scents, some are even EDP's and extraits.  Most generally under 20US dollars.  Hard to find in stores (Anthropologie has a limited amount)

\+1 on Pacifica.  

Zum has some very interesting scents.   My favorite Myrrh and Frankincense

And while this did not start off life as a cheapy, Alfred Sung Shi, Pure, and Sung are generally very cheap.

Also, everyone should try SJP Covet.    Def. not your average celeb scent."

"I agree it isn’t been as impressive as years past, but there are definitely albums “worth mentioning” outside of the super underground album you mentioned"
Sad to see the Infinity Blade series didn't make the cut.
"I see. I think that the cheapest device worth going for is the [**ASUS Vivobook 15**](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1883484/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-VivoBook-15-6-FHD-Display-AMD-Ryzen-3-3200U-4GB-DDR4-128GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-in-S-mode-Slate-Gray-F512DA-WH31%2F700011839). It only has 4 GB RAM, so I would upgrade it if possible."
I bought an otter box case. I’m a little worried though because it says it fits an iPhone 12 Pro Max. I bought the 13 pro max though I’m not sure if they’re the same sizes?
"Not yet, finishing a series atm, but this will be next - I'll let you know my thoughts"
