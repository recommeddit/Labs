Yeah was going to say the same one. Love that it's not carbonated and has a lovely taste. Gutted that it's pretty impossible to get in the uk now.
What job opportunities are there?
"I like Whitechapel on my husband.  It might strike you as unfortunately named, but that's sort of the Black Phoenix thing.

http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wanderlust.html Near the bottom.  It's a musky smell with a bit of citrus."
"Yes. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream...

And what's the twist?"
"The curse of the weggy board was funny too,


A luigi board"
"Every month I spend $100 on myself. Tervis tumblers, Yeti Ramblers and a GSHOCK GD350 With the negative display have been my last 3 purchases."
Sounds like it's probably a pretty good list then.
"Sorry, just cologne isn't gonna cut it, contrary to what the ad tried to sell you."
"A few of the perks, according to my astrophysics prof:

1. When astronomers get together, they drink.

2. The higher altitude of most observatories means getting drunk is cheaper.

3. The drink helps you forget how little you're getting paid for this."
I like Hawthorne wipes too!
"I mean, that's like half of BGW. That's why I think it's weird."
Cloudy water is often just the result of trapped air bubbles.
"Here are two not yet mentioned, both very well written and directed films about con-men:

Ridley Scott's **Matchstick Men**.

And Tony ""Michael Clayton"" Gilroy's **Duplicity**."
"It's the same for me and I'll get the PC version of timed exclusive console games, if the game really interested me to play more (MHW, RDR2, ...) and the port isn't a total disaster (unlike launch Horizon Zero Dawn)."
"They might've guessed it completely coincidentally but no, Vader wasn't originally going to be Lukes father, it's just a neat coincidence"
"This is one of the most commercially unaware, common-sense lacking, devoid of perspective opinions I have ever read online, in 20 years of using the internet. My eyes have seen incoherent posts, statistical deception, non-popperian arguments, ungrammatical posts, insane conspiracy theories and logical fallacies. OP's post is coherent and grammatical, yet is orders of magnitude more silly than anything else I have ever read. Perhaps it is BECAUSE he is an above average IQ individual that unironically believes the words he just typed out."
Any of the remakes. Go with something modern.
"Perhaps, but isn't it good until you get sick of it?"
Similar here. My favorite is Pycharm / IntelliJ with Vim Plugin.
awww i love dream!!! she's so cute :)

The internet trains us into such bad habits.  I actually stopped reading your post at ""That's an odd number"" and started typing a joke reply before even reading the next word.  >.<"
I switched to Verizon postpaid from AT&T Prepaid. Deprioritization was pretty severe (sometimes couldn't even send an iMessage) but customer service was quite good. Ended up switching to AT&T postpaid (Unlimited Elite) and it's been very solid.
"The Grand Canyon is a particularly awesome spot if you do it right. Personally, I think just going there to see it and doing nothing more would be a bit of a waste and there just isn't that much to do in Flagstaff. Honestly, not even great for a day trip if you can do it. 

However, there are TONS of multi-day excursions and camping opportunities that can take you through the Canyon. You really get lost in the incredibly beauty and vastness of the Canyon, great hikes, climbs, waterfalls & streams feeding into the Colorado, the wildlife, stars, its beautiful. I've been several times for short to quite long camping trips. Every time has been just as good as the last and the Canyon is so large that I feel as if I've never had the same experience. Just know your limits, its hot as hell and you have to climb up to get out - so don't get too tired from your journey and get stuck down there from fatigue."
"I know, but IMO I shouldn’t need to do that. The argument made by developers for why fetch shouldn’t reject on 400+ makes no sense at all to me and because of that annoyance I’m faithful to axios."
Third for Armani Code in the brown bottle.
