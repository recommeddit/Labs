"Byredo is niche, so you've got yourself started at least. Obviously, I love BdA as well üíó

I really wish someone could make a little discovery sample set of fragrance classics like Jicky, L'Air du Temps, even Fracas ha ha. I've smelled most of them but it took me years! Definitely worth the journey, though."

I cry everytime. Dat walk in the rain."

"Tony Hawk, late 90's. He came to our local skatepark for a demo but it was a tiny little indoor park and he couldn't do much. After skating for a bit to appease the crowd, he snuck out the back across the parking lot to the bowling alley. Me and two friends followed him, he invited us to bowl with him, bought us chicken tenders and french fries and talked about skateboarding with us for over an hour. Honestly one of the coolest guys I've ever met, fast forward 20 years later and I get to meet him again at our local skatepark unveiling that his foundation helped pay for and man, he was just as cool. We chatted a bit at the water fountain, I mentioned that as a kid he treated us to chicken tenders and french fries at the bowling alley when I was just a kid, and wouldn't you know it he was like oh in Amity Ct? Wasn't the skatepark called B17? I was simply floored. He went on to explain he was having a rough day that day and just hanging with three little kids bowling and talking skateboarding made him realize just how great life was. 

Thank you for everything you have ever done for skateboarding Tony!"

I would love to read it when you're finished! The Adirondacks made me who I am. It's important to me and unlike anywhere I've ever been.
"Big 'ol box full of variety stuff they've never tried before: exfoliating bath soaps, those coarse shower gloves that go well with them, few boxes of variety tea (to include herbals and fruits), small sizes of sweet coffee creamer or two (butter pecan is my personal favorite), go to a bakery and get little mini-pies, cookies, rice krispie treats, put it all in the box and take it over.

""Here, a little of everything and some new stuff for you to try.""

She reportedly devoured all of the food in the box in a few days.  Picked up exfoliating soap as a habit from that, too.  Didn't much like all of the tea, but she took a liking to strawberry and peach mixed with chamomile."
"Shang-Chi is amazing and one of the top 5-6 Marvel movies for sure.

That said, it doesn't come remotely close to touching Infinity War or Civil War"
Exactly lol.
Salman was so cute in the 90s omg! In the Janam Samjha Karo title song ufff üòç
"Maybe acknowledge that you appreciate her for what she does for your dad? My stepmom never once tried to replace my mom, even in small instances in public when people assumed she was, she always politely corrected the assumption. I loved that and I let her know I appreciated that.  Likewise, I let her know how much it meant to me that she was with my dad- he was in a bad place after my parents divorce and she got him out of it. That meant so much to me, and it wasn't something my own mother, or myself and my sister could do. 

She isn't a replacement, she isn't your mother, but she could be a good friend and ally. What would you do for a friend?


(I realize not everyone had such a stellar relationship with step parents, and some people are assholes.)"

No clue. She has no hobbies and does nothing. I have no idea.
"It's not too bad tbh, just nothing outstanding."
"for windows, `far`

Comes with a text editor/hex viewer, can move files with the mouse if you want to, can open many archive types, and it has the same context menu as windows explorer including all your custom entries."
"I've used a North Face Recon for about 8 or 9 years now, never had a problem with it. If you ever do, they'll fix it or replace it. Great bag, I highly recommend it."
I can check my local library but I am in a pretty rural place. I think they only got 3 computers in it.

"Well yeah I suppose that is the same here. Not really ""home made"" but breweries converted over to making hand sanitizer."
"The whole song is great, but man that break near the end when the bass pumps up and the talkbox kicks in brings it to a whole 'nother level."
