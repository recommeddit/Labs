Edit: it does have a thick lip around the cameras",best iphone case

We have high forest and mountain peaks over 13,000 feet all the way down to low desert and everything in between.  We have the most ecologically diverse state in the country.  If you like the outdoors then you are doing yourself an incredible disservice by not coming here and driving around for a few days.",best state to visit in the United States

26702,"Adding my own list as I was surprised to see some games omitted.

**1: Sushi Go Party:** An introduction to drafting games that's easy to teach. I've had better luck bringing this out with new players compared to **7 Wonders**, which is definitely a great take on the genre.

**2: Ticket to Ride: Europe:** Much more interesting than the base game without being overly complex.

**3: Bohnanza:** I haven't really played a game that encourages open trading the same way Bohnanza does. Simple to teach also.

**4: Kingdomino:** Simple tile-laying game that's very satisfying to play. Not as overwhelming as **Carcassonne** can be to newer players.

**5: Dominion:** The king of deck-builders with plenty of room for expansion.

**6: YINSH:** My choice of abstract; attracts a lot of attention on the table, simple to teach yet extremely engaging.

**7: Cosmic Encounter:** A little more complex than other games on the list, but provides an excellent experience of space politics.

**8: Deception: Murder in Hong Kong:** My 6+ player game of choice. Very simple to pick up, and can cause the table to explode with accusations and theories.

**9: Codenames:** Fun wordplay game that's a crowdpleaser.

**10: Specter Ops:** Something with a longer playtime that's incredibly intense, while pulling off the stealth genre in board game form.",best board games

2915,"These were my first opens, however, I got a few others to try them (akg712, dt 8xx, 6xx) and make my decision (these were the first of the batch that came in and I put them on first as well, certainly adds bias). 

I have not found them to be muddy or veiled, nor do they have a burn in period (imo). I have one pair myself but I purchased two more during prime day for my best friend and father and tried theirs as well. They sounded virtually identical (I may not be able to hear the difference if there is one) when I tried them (I was wondering about that mythical ‘burn in’ myself). 

Compared to my previous ‘gaming’ headsets they are like crystal perfection as well. I previously utilized Cloud 9 hyperx Alphas (different models, revolver, rev s, etc) and a few other astro/steel series models. 

I will say the easiest explanation for clarity is this:
I listen to a lot of classical and in, for example, tchaikovsky I can pick out the individual elements of the orchestra and where they are on the stage itself. Additionally, in shooters, I can pick out exactly where footsteps come from on a site. 

I think the bass may be jarring for some people — it is not as guttural/boomy as a ‘gamer’ headset, instead being more throaty and pealing out in individual notes. But if you are looking for a thump thump/wub wub you are probably going to want a different headset, as this is much more equipped for tonality, trebles, mids, and soundstage.",best headphones
