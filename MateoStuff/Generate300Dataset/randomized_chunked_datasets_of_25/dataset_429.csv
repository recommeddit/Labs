23862,best anime,"Ive had someone suggest this to me saying that if I loved Elfen Lied, I'd love Monster. 

Would you say this is a pretty good assumption? I have a long ass watch list, but I've jumped a few anime ahead because people told me specifically that I'd like them because I liked Elfen Lied. (Serial Experiments Lain, and Mirai Nikki)"

30814,best country to live in,"The country is beautiful, but you have to deal with the [**M**other **F**ucking **S**wiss.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11pcs1/while_i_lived_in_an_apartment_i_kept_a_linksys/c6oqc3m)

This comment is one of the most upvoted posts on /r/Switzerland. And as a Swiss guy I really think it hits the nail on the head. If you feel like you can not only cope with all that but also adapt to *become* like that, then you are welcome."
59467,best perfume,"Chanel Coco, Chanel Egoiste, Chanel Chance Eau Fraiche (I know perfume snobs degrade it but it’s just so perfect!) Allure Homme line mainly the original & Blanche! Burberry Brit. 


Malle French Lover, Malle Dries Van Noten & some
Of the MFK fragrances."
60320,best freezer brand,"Unless you keep track of every item that you have in there and their expiration dates, you're going to end up wasting a lot of money. My mom *hates* our chest freezer for this reason. Sometimes they are so deep, that the item at the very bottom you'll only see once: when you first place it in there. If you have only large items then this won't be a problem, but for smaller items, it's more than likely going to be very difficult to not have a lot of wasted food at the end of the day."
51622,best iphone case,I got the same case. it arrived today.
38164,best Marvel movie,"I like Endgame a lot! I also remember enjoying the experience in the theater more than Infinity War. It did a great job with the payoff all us fans had been waiting on for sure! Especially when Captain America wielded Mjolnir! I just think Infinity War compared to Endgame overall is a superior film due to pacing, character arcs, story, etc."
6282,best Netflix documentary,13th
15661,best sunglasses for fashion,"[Kent Wang](http://www.kentwang.com/misc/sunglasses)

$55, or occasionally a little less on Massdrop. I have the keyhole sunglasses; they're very sturdy and they look good. I've never owned an ""expensive"" pair of sunglasses, but I can't imagine that the build quality could be much better."
63085,Best online React course,"I would suggest Maximilian Schwarzmüller’s React.js course (it’s worth mentioning that he has a react native course as well),he really dives deep into the concepts and you’ll learn from scratch, everything is explained clearly and you can follow along nicely, he also has a couple of videos on youtube however those are less comprehensive when compared to the Udemy courses.

Hope this helps!"
54874,best water filter,"Laboratory here. The filter unit we use is from [Millipore](http://www.millipore.com/catalogue/module/C79625). It produces water below 5 parts per billion. List price is $12k but I got it down to >$5k with trade-in. The part I think is cool is that the water basically doesn't conduct electricity anymore at that purity. The purity is measured in part by using its resistivity, which is extremely high."
67562,axios alternatives reddit,ELI5 for someone who really has only been using basic features of `request` (I think): can anyone explain what kind of feature differences make the listed alternatives range in library size from half a kb (`node-fetch`) to over 800kb (`urllib`)?
32644,best vacation resort,"I don't have general tips but one specific: I spent my honeymoon (2011) at Bucuti in Aruba (http://www.bucuti.com/)
It's not all inclusive, but I would definitely reccomend it.
Its guests are 90% honeymoon couples.
The island itself is fantastic.
Feel free to reply or contact me for further informations :-)"

66476,best soccer team in the world,"On the other hand, a IA that only wants to manipulate algorithms to favour Poland sounds preferrable to other options."
8703,best toothpaste,"You're correct. Take a look at the raw numbers and you'd laugh at the idea that baking soda was capable of abrading teeth at all. Toothpaste is definitely abrasive, and in a 1-1 comparison is far more abrasive than baking soda.

But baking soda is well-known to whiten teeth through abrasion, and it's not a 1-1 usage. Baking soda is pretty much pure, whereas toothpaste is mostly not comprised of abrasive substances. Additionally, many of the people using baking soda add in some acid, which magnifies the abrasion tremendously. There's some evidence that the abrasive elements of normal toothpaste lose their effectiveness in \~20 seconds, whereas baking soda keeps abrading longer, so that's another potential difference.

The final note is that fluoride is the real champion of dental care, so baking soda is just more abrasion on top of whatever abrasion you get from the fluoride-containing toothpaste you should be using."
33907,best Pokemon game,I'll say anything from Gen 3 (So Ruby-Sapphire-Emerald or FireRed-GreenLeaf). Most bull was already ironed out at that point and it doesn't have much unnecessary fluff added yet.
