"You should try the $800 one Toto makes. That’s like the best purchase we ever made. seat is heated, has a nightlight in the bowl and out, temperature adjustable seat and multiple spray setting with a remote control to customize your buttwashing experience. Cleans the toilet bowl with electrochemically ionized water when done. Lifts the top seat for you with a motion sensor, puts one or both lids down when you get leave.

Only downside is you have to install a GFI outlet by your toilet."
"It's harder to find now, but Michael Jordan had his own fragrance line back in the 90s. That shit was my secret fucking weapon in college."
"Well, like I said it's all about preference and where you feel happy.

Australia is home to me, and always will be, and Norway is home to you. Fair enough, I respect that. And Australian women aren't half bad either haha."

"**Mansplaining**

Mansplaining (a blend of the word man and the informal form splaining of the verb explaining) means ""(of a man) to comment on or explain something to a woman in a condescending, overconfident, and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner"".  Lily Rothman of The Atlantic defines it as ""explaining without regard to the fact that the explainee knows more than the explainer, often done by a man to a woman"". Author Rebecca Solnit ascribes the phenomenon to a combination of ""overconfidence and cluelessness"".

In its original use, mansplaining differed from other forms of condescension in that it is rooted in the sexist assumption that a man is likely to be more knowledgeable than a woman.

"Tech companies are not expressly looking for workaholics.  Sure, it's great if we have people who work hard, and we want people who are motivated and so on.  We even want people who will work long hours at times (and they get paid a commensurate salary).

But when we ask for passion, we're looking for people who are excited about the domain they're in, and who draw meaning from accomplishing something in that domain.  Those people will be the ones who come up with the best and most innovative solutions.  They're the ones who are willing and able to tackle a problem that other people say is too hard.  Or who will raise the bar on what is ""good enough"", and not settle for status quo.  Now obviously passion alone isn't sufficient for this - we're actually looking for passion and brilliance - but those two often go hand in hand.

Those qualities are much more important than being a workaholic, and we will bias towards those every day of the week."

Divinity Original Sin 2?
I'm on board with this and am in no way an Adam Sandler fan. I never though he'd illicit an emotional response from me. Fucker. Gave it 4/5

"[This person](https://www.parfumo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=52043#52043) did a meta analysis of reviews on Fragrantica and Parfumo and came up with a “best of” list. Of course scent is subjective, so someone’s favorite smell can be someone else’s least favorite."
