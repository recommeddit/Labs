"For me, the degree that would do me the most help in the career I want, would be a double minor in English and Creative writing. It might not be an engineering degree in terms of being able to get a job straight our of college, but it's something I'm passionate about doing. To me, that's the most important thing."

"I hear a lot of people complaining about the controls but they're not bad imo. The game is more cinematic so the game is heavily animation based compared to something like Bloodborne. So I don't think it's that there is anything wrong with the controls, moreso the designers decided to make the game as realistic as possible."

"BBQ Ribs? Football? Drinking? There is one city that comes to mind immediately:

Washington D.C.

All of the major museums are free to get into, the national monuments are awesome, there seems to be five new amazing restaurants opening up there every week, and the city is packed with twenty-somethings who want to drink heavily and party.

Also, the East Coast is home to what is perhaps my favorite US cultural institution: [Five Guys](http://www.fiveguys.com/), the greatest burger joint to ever grace this wonderful land of ours. I live in California right now, and the stuff they have out here does *not* compare.

I'm not saying it's the only place to visit in America (far from it, in fact), but anyone telling you to skip the rest of the country and visit California is steering you wrong."
"I'm going to sneak a slightly left field one in early:

* [Mostly Harmless Econometrics](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/)

I think having some understanding of causal inference and quasi experimental methods is critical in data science and this is definitely the best text I've read on the matter (It's baby brother [Mastering Metrics](http://masteringmetrics.com/) is great too). 

I've just come back from a data science and machine learning conference and was shocked at how much time was spent on acknowledging pitfalls that are absolutely obvious to even undergrads in econometrics, e.g endogeneity, identification issues, structual relationships and simultaneity. All issues econometric models are designed to deal with. 

Even if you think these issues have no relation to your own modelling (you're wrong), this text is worth scanning to get a broader idea of what's actually on the table for a data scientist to assess (likely more than you think). 

For the R stack ([APM](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) mentioned above aside):

* Here's Hadley Wickham's instant classic on everything outside of model building, [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
* [Introduction to Statistical Learning with R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) needing no introduction.
* The other Hadley Wickham bible [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
* The surprisingly indepth coverage of deep learning with keras, [Deep Learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r).
* Free time series text with applications in R covering key classical and modern methods, [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.org/fpp2/)."
