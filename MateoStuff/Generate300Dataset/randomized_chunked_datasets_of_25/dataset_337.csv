49069,"It’s a little dated now and you can most likely find something equivalent to it for less but I’ve had my Asus PG279Q for almost 3 yrs now and I couldn’t be happier with it. There are some QC issues where backlight bleed is more present than others but mine is hardly noticeable and I don’t even notice it during gameplay. Linus also did a video on it referring to it as “the holy grail of monitors” It definitely was and still is one of the best all around monitors you can buy.

14662,"I love Catherine Coulter's regency books. She's gotten away from them in recent years, sadly. May Balough is another good writer, as is Teresa Medeiros.

I enjoy Regency era romances the most of all. The worst books to me tend to be ones that have a contemporary setting. I want the escapism! 

As a generality, I would say to stay away from Nora Roberts. Her books in particular are just... dreck... She's too big name of an author to edit properly, imho, and she churns out so many books that she's lost any spark of originality or character in her writing.",best romantic novel
