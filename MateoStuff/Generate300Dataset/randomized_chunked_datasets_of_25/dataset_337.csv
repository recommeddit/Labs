54708,best water filter,They have water test kits that test everything from just the pH(simple tests) to the more elaborate ones that test for specific metals.
46700,best hand santizer brand,"Idk if you have Twitter but FatKidDeals and EveryDaySteals are 2 accounts who post Amazon deals. I’ve managed to snag about 2 gallons worth of GermX and Amazon Brand Solimo hand sanitizer the last 2 months. Just turn on notifications, they restock every 2 weeks or so"
49069,best gaming monitor,"It’s a little dated now and you can most likely find something equivalent to it for less but I’ve had my Asus PG279Q for almost 3 yrs now and I couldn’t be happier with it. There are some QC issues where backlight bleed is more present than others but mine is hardly noticeable and I don’t even notice it during gameplay. Linus also did a video on it referring to it as “the holy grail of monitors” It definitely was and still is one of the best all around monitors you can buy.

26870,best board games,"Aww, I put in a BGG order a week ago. Faiyum and  Merchants of Dunhuang weren't on my radar then."
16047,best sunglasses for fashion,I buy cheap ones. At the moment I really like square-ish cat-eye sunglasses. I found a pair that worked for me at Urban Outfitters for $16. I have a lot of trouble finding sunglasses that aren't too big for my face. They usually end up looking very odd on me.

55456,best action and adventure novel series,"Late to the show here but wanted to say this thread directed me to your Riyria books about a month ago. I just finished them and loved them! I especially appreciated the time you took to let the reader enjoy the simple moments - time in the taverns, in the village, on the road by the camp fire."
14662,best romantic novel,"I love Catherine Coulter's regency books. She's gotten away from them in recent years, sadly. May Balough is another good writer, as is Teresa Medeiros.

I enjoy Regency era romances the most of all. The worst books to me tend to be ones that have a contemporary setting. I want the escapism! 

As a generality, I would say to stay away from Nora Roberts. Her books in particular are just... dreck... She's too big name of an author to edit properly, imho, and she churns out so many books that she's lost any spark of originality or character in her writing."
23238,best car racing video game,Assetto Corsa
9681,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Santa Catalina (ft) has a shared bathroom between two rooms. I believe all the other dorms have shared bathrooms among the whole floor. I liked the portola dining commons for the most part when i lived at ft. 

Ft has a reputation for being a “party dorm” but honestly i didnt find it much louder than santa cruz/anacapa and i stayed there a lot. it just depends"
29108,best calendar tool,Not in the app.
71628,best movies with a cool twist,"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, beautiful cinematography and an ending you'll never see coming."
66120,best college in california,I go to CCA (California College of the Arts) but I don't think there is a big enough audience to create a subreddit for it... apparently us art schoolers are too busy for redditing.
38061,best Marvel movie,"You should be showing the average rating, that’s a better way to compare them."
40899,best instrument to play,"Every instrument has its challenges. Piano?  Sure, it makes a sound when you play it easily but ten fingers at a time doing different things?  Not easy. Trumpet? Easy fingers, hard embouchure. 

Every instrument will be a different challenge for different people. 

Except saxophone. That’s always easy. Until you have to play French music. Then it’s extraordinarily difficult."
14534,best romantic novel,Thank you so much for the suggestion! I will check her out.

30835,best country to live in,My wife is from there and she says it is great for a vacation but actually a pretty boring place to live.
