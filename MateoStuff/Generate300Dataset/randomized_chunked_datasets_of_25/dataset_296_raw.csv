When I was growing up it was all about Peyton Manning. I even begged my madre to buy those shitty Wheaties re-releases because he was on the cover.
Maybe we’ll see when they get closer.
Hahaha.  Good idea...though possibly expensive.
"Rebecca, by Daphne DuMarier. (I'm on my phone, can't check the spelling.) It's a mystery tinged with romance. Very suspenseful. A great read."
God of War isn't an RPG. Horizon barely is either.
"And the Patriots get around the salary cap by having players paid less than they would elsewhere.  Let's not pretend that the NFC of the 80's was weaker than the AFC of the 2000's, so the parity argument is a very thin one."
Some of us were in middle school before axe hit the scene
"The Keepers

Wild Wild Country

Icarus

And if you have HBO Now watched Tickled. That shit gets bananas."
"Do you have the 27 or 32 inch?

Yes the flickering was fixed by turning on VRR, but that also introduces judder to certain games so to me it’s more like a bandaid fix . . if you have no issues I’m happy for you tho! it is a great monitor, in terms of picture quality it is definitely the closest I’ve seen in a monitor when compared to CX"
"“We’ve put in the next generation chip (A11->A12), upgraded the cameras, and put a longer-life battery in a X case.”"
"The locals are just like us. They are going to pick the very best jobs avalible to them. Just because it's a crappy, low paying job by your standards doesn't mean it isn't a job they are happy with.

And at the end of the day, the quality of life of the people who live and work there has nothing to do with whether or not LightningReptar chooses to vacation there or not."
"Second the Pur water pitcher. We have gross city water (chlorinated to all hell) and the filter makes it taste so clean and fresh. It's nice to always have tasty cold water in the fridge. It tastes better than Brita, and cleaner too."
Quick Graph has been pretty good for me when I’m not near a computer and I need to see roughly what something looks like.
Genshin Impact.
"I actually have a bit of art already, my wife thinks I have too much for the size of the space.  It's just not shown here :)."
"I know people *are*, I just don't know *why*."
"stay in school and get a degree kid! Dont ever think those scam online courses etc. will teach you ""how to be a developer"".
If you learn javascript you can both do backend and frontend, so as a jack of all trades I would recommend JS"
cookie dough!
That was my dream hotel when I was little.
OP: who is your least fav?
"I like to use it as a tool. I don't (anymore) blindly follow the suggestions, but I use it as a challenge to my writing. Red sentences are usually convoluted in my experience. I try to have a mix of yellow and unhighlighted sentences to vary the structure, but don't fret too much over it in general. I usually do the purple simpler phrase suggestions, but not always. The blue adverbs and green passive voice are great, though. I check each of them to see if I actually want passive voice / if I can replace it with something better, and check if adverb / verb pairs can be replaced by a better verb or not. Once again, I don't try to get rid of them all, just use it to say ""Hey, is this doing what you want?"" and purposefully choosing how to write it rather than blindly going with my first instinct."
"There are benchmark that are there to test CPU's and get a comparison of raw CPU performances such as cinebench.   


When it comes to games, you are using good hardware then test it at settings that would be expected such as high/ultra. If you are testing low end chips then pair it with a low end GPU and test it in games with that. When I look at CPU comparisons for games I want them to be realistic to what they are going to be used for."

Wish I'd have known this was a thing in college
Why is this being downvoted? What am I missing other than Darvin Cook being a little lower than the other voters?
