There are a lot of ridiculous aspects to Excel, a lot of missing functionality and bad UX choices. There are major obstacles for a lot of use cases.

That said, it's still better than any competitor. I get annoyed when I run into something frustrating in Excel, but I wouldn't even be able to get *to* those points in any competitor. There are a handful of things Sheets will do better, yes, but far more things Excel will do better than Sheets.

The real lesson, I think, is that there is room for a serious Excel competitor. And I think we need one, because here we are in 2020 and you *still* can't change Excel's number autoconversion behavior, or have macros work without clearing the undo stack.",best spreadsheet editor

I make this on the weekend, and I've got a delicious hot breakfast ready in minutes. Add a little milk, or if you're feeling luxurious, add *cream*!

Once it's baked, I portion it out into muffin tins (sprayed with a tiny spritz of oil), and freeze them into meal-sized blocks that are microwave-ready.

**INGREDIENTS**

1¬Ω cups (3 med) mashed bananas  
2 large eggs  
¬º cup white sugar  
¬æ tsp vanilla extract  
¬Ω tsp salt  
¬æ tsp baking powder  
2 cups milk  
2¬Ω cups old fashioned oats  
8 ounces frozen blueberries   
 
**INSTRUCTIONS**

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. 

Mash the bananas in a measuring cup, starting with two or three and adding more until you have 1.5 cups of banana mash.

Combine the banana mash in the large bowl with the eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and baking powder. Whisk to combine. Add the milk and whisk again until smooth.Stir in the dry old-fashioned oats. Lastly, stir in the frozen blueberries (keeping them frozen and stirring them in last helps prevent the entire mix from turning purple). 

Spray an 8√ó8 inch baking dish with non-stick spray and then pour in the oat mixture.

Bake in the preheated 375 degree oven and bake for about 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the center is no longer wet to the touch.",best breakfast foods
