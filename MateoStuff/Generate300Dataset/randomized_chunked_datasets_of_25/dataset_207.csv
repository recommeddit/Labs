45792,best trick or treating candy,"Best:  The ""bit-o-honey"" chews. Careful though, they'll rip out a filling. Oh, and those small Hershey chocolate bars.  

Worst: Fireballs.  As a kid, I just couldn't ever enjoy those, and I always seem to get a lot of them.  They slip down to the bottom of the bag, so you don't realize you got 50 of them until your stash is low."

44741,best items under $100,"God Tier: An ergonomic Mouse, saving my wfh wrists.

&#x200B;

Novelty: Wi-Fi enabled RGB lights (got a 4-pack for 45$ish). Absolutely useless, but my brain makes THE GOOD CHEMICAL when I can yell ""RED ALERT"" at google and make my lamps turn red."
15949,best sunglasses for fashion,"I think the answer depends on various factors and then it's still highly subjective.  I remember when Ray Bans cost less then $20, so it seems odd that anyone would pay $70+ for a pair today.  The increase in price is mostly due to the designer price tag, but I'm sure the quality is also much better today."

29067,best calendar tool,"I have already tried Google Galendar, but I don't want to schedule, because my tasks don't come on regular basis. I just want to save time inputing tasks because 99% are recurring."

17089,best iOS game,"I think you might have it confused with a different game.
