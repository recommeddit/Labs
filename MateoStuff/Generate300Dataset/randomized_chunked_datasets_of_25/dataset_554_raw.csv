"""That... that's actually kind of gross, you know? After that joke, I always clarify that I'm just joking. I do not know how much tartar I actually have. I believe it's the average amount. If we all did a tartar test right now, my name would be right in the fucking middle."""
"Published researcher reporting in. Please, for the love of God, do this. I don't care how many times this gets (x)(re)posted, it's important for people to know. I'd rather share the knowledge for free -- we all stand on the shoulders of giants."
"I apologize in advance for my cynicism but I don't see how this idea is going to work. There are just too many fields of science and scientific papers tend to be in niche and esoteric subfields. I don't know if it is possible for a subreddit, but a tag cloud or some other method to categorize the papers by discipline would make it a lot more readable."
My roommate made a brown Russian the other day when we only had chocolate milk. Not sure how it went.
Is paprika and inception too similar? I don't want to watch paprika and feel like I'm just watching an anime version of inception
Never been but super stoked to attend this year.  Is staying on the strip a real hassle to and from each night?  Seems like staying within walking distance downtown is the way to go.
"Chrome's memory usage never really bothered me; my opinion is, unused memory is wasted memory. I already use ublock origin and bitwarden, I'll have to check out privacy badger. I always just assumed ublock blocked most of the tracking crap already."
"We didn’t Go in depth for me. But basically it was a result of the TX independent movement, which occurred because Mexico wanted to settle the land and control the population better, so allowed American settlers. As Mexico started to realize the danger of having Americans who still identified as American on their land , they attempted to stop it and suppress it, which led to war, and the US stepping in to protect our “people”"

"Okay, I'm sorry. This is my first post and I was unaware. I apologize that my ""common ass minimum wage"" life created such a disturbance to your apparently very important one, as you obviously have nothing better to do than to take the time to chastise me for this cardinal sin of mispost. 
Downvoted."
"I have the momentum 3, to my ears it’s not a competition at all. The XMs are all bass, the M3 actually have some range (although still elevated in the bass)"
Crepe maple.  Spitfire ginko.
I use my veterans discount every time I go to HD.  Just show my license which has my veteran status on it.
Really? Because reviews say otherwise. https://www.whathifi.com/us/reviews/sennheiser-momentum-wireless
"IIRC, Target asked for a <$40 product, but they argued it up to $50."
"Agreed. I'm in the middle of Seveneves but it already feels weaker than Anathem, Snowcrash, or Cryptonomicon. I like the book, but there are some plot elements that have made me cringe multiple times already."
I mean you can always buy a used one as well for cheap. I got C920 for 20$ off Facebook and works perfect.
"My partner's work just let her know John Hancock is offering ""My Money Connector"". From the short video it seems like this might be another option. Has anyone used it?"
The fern is fantastic.
"Also, everyone keeps talking about the boys liking MCU movies. Did they go through the entire MCU on Patreon? I'm not a member because I'm poor, but I may have to shell out if they're covering Marvel."

"I love B&Bs, and that sounds amazing, but I'm pretty sure most of these places being discussed have more than a minimal knowledge of food service hygiene, I wouldn't worry THAT much about the buffet..."
"Exactly. That is not a valid data source to demonstrate the actual popularity and, more importantly, actual distribution of candy brands in each state.

This whole thing is almost completely meaningless in the real world."
Nahhh. My one is a better best thing ;\^)
I've honestly never heard this actually but I also don't play golf or tennis and I do fish. I wear polarized glasses for driving but I never felt like my depth perception was off.
