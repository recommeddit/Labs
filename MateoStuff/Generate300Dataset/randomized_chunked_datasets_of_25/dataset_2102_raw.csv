Yes. I just switched from consumer cellular ($30) to mint mobile ($15) and happy with both
No way is Oxymoron essential. Habits and Contradictions was the better album anyway
"I Stand corrected, but the dictionary wonâ€™t though."
"Have fun returning without your pants or anything else, and maybe die. Oh and PIRATES YAAAAAR"
"Think I watched half of the first episode with a friend but then I had to leave the house and never watched it again. 
Totally gonna start watching it in the next few days"
"There's a similar drink I unfortunately think I invented as a college freshman. I called it a Bulldog. Basically it was a Brass Monkey except sub a 40 and OJ for a bottle of MD 20/20 (""Mad Dog"") and a Red Bull energy drink. Drink your dog halfway then top the bottle off with the Red Bull. Proceed to have a party for one under a bridge somewhere. Wake up missing teeth."

"I mean, if you like it that's great, but I found it super generic and boring. And I think my opinion might be a more common opinion on it especially after watching a few YouTube reviewers review it."
"I know you were kidding, but my accounting friends and I always joked about how off-base the ""awkward/shy/bland"" accountant stereotype was amongst us. Granted we were going into/are in public accounting, which is a little different than your typical ""Debbie in Accounting"" type, but still. I actually worked in the machine lab on campus as a bookkeeper and I was always shocked at how about half the engineering kids that came in couldnt form a sentence or speak like a human in any way."
"Haven't been able to wear Nikes since high school and when I did, it was due to wanting a brand name shoe and not what was best for my athletic needs.  They are terribly narrow."
"Thatâ€™s the great/bad thing about books and these lists, they are so very subjective. I know there is definitely a contingent of people the Hating Game didnâ€™t work for; it takes all kinds. 

I happen to be one of the people who loved it, but I can understand how people can not enjoy it, too. If you do like the enemies-to-lovers trope, is there a book that you think would have been a good addition to the list? (Im always looking for recs!) 

I think with the Milan books, not as many people associate her with the contemporary books she has written. I know I personally constantly forget she has written them because her historical are so prevalent in my mind. I really should read the Cyclone series, though..."
"Kingdoms of Amalur was rereleased for ps4, its the same thing as was before, but if you havent played it then and dont mind older graphics and quest design, go for it, its old school rpg, with its own charm."
"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, but I Feel Like a Millionaire - Queens of the Stone Age"
Definitely. Lot of people compare it to NFS Shift 1 & 2 and its done by some of the same developers.

"Add an r to that ending, that's what I want"
I knew someone who had this with a bottle of Everclear in a paint can. You'll never guess what it was called.
"There are several nice evergreen trees that are hardy in your zone. You could plant evergreen Magnolia, Christmas Holly, Eucalyptus neglecta/gunnii or train Cherry laurel as a tree.

My personal favorite though would be Loquat. It has large, broad, evergreen leaves and if the trees are old enough or grafted, a pleasantly smelling bloom. It also has the Award of Garden Merit by the RHS and if you are lucky and the winters are mild enough, you might even get fruit off of it. For that reason I would get a self-fertile, late-ripening fruit variety to increase your chances (such as Tanaka).

I can also vouch for the very nice smell of Cherry laurel flowers."

That is vile. I guess I'm glad I know.
"Honestly I am going with a high core count CPU so I can replace everything with one computer. It will be running a proxmox and will visualize a media server, Linux for work and a Windows machine for gaming, and a few docker containers for PLEX, and a few applications."
I recently started gaming on an LG Oled display and It makes a huge difference. The colors are just so vivid and it still runs at 120 which feels so nice. Probably my favorite part of my setup now
