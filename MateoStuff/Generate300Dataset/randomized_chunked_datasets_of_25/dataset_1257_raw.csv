Nice! Any feedback on its auto-connection with your bank savings account?
"I consider Illmatic the definitive NYC hip hop album, especially considering it was released during a time period when West Coast hip hop (Dre, 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, etc) was largely dominating the mainstream's attention."

Timecrimes is on Netflix and is definitely worth watching. Also ‘Synchronicity’.
Crystal Geyser all the way. It doesn't have weird tastes like dasani or aquafina. The only thing that matches it is the water from the filter water dispensers around my university.
Pick a charity :~)
"How dense can you be? It's all time top European clubs, not all time top clubs to have won most UCLs."
To be fair though if it was just a list of who won the most CLs then there'd be no point to this. It's about perception and Liverpool's relatively dry last few years have shaped that. Same reason Barca are so high. I imagine too United winning the treble could be used as an example of something they have over Liverpool
"So many good players on the NFC West teams not listed here too: DK, Jamal, Whitworth, Baker, JJ, Jones, etc."
"First of all it's my opinion, so fuck off in that regard. Secondly, I have a legitimate explanation;

Edit: Fuck. You're going to have to take my word for it, but I wrote a 3-paragraph in-depth explanation on my phone, and only the first two sentences posted. I'll do my best to give a brief summary of what it was;

When I first got BK: NaB I had no previous experience whatsoever with any Banjo Kazooie game. In fact, I had never even heard of Banjo Kazooie beforehand. I saw it in the discount aisle at my local toystore, and asked my mom to buy it because I felt like trying something different.

When I first got home and played it, I was blown away. The graphics were beautiful and well stylized, and had enormous amounts of detail in all the right places, but not too much otherwise. The orchestrated music was unique and interesting, and fit each individual area very well. The tongue-in-cheek humor just topped it off for me.

But what I loved most was the core gameplay; engineering. I loved architecture, design and engineering as a kid, and still do now (currently working on a software engineering degree), so I was immediately hooked. The challenges were both interesting and varied, as well as difficult enough to present a proper challenge. Outide of them, I would spend hours just designing machines that barely qualified as vehicles most of the time, because it was so much fun. I never even ended up playing the original two games once I found out about them, because they just didn't appeal to me as much.

**TL;DR I picked it up with an unbiased view and loved it because it's main mechanic drew me in.**"

"~~Gran Turismo 2.~~

~~Because it's really the only racing sim I ever played for more than 20 minutes. Unlocking everything in that game was hard as fuck. Especially as a non-racing gamer.~~

EDIT: Wait... I forgot about BeamNG. Does that count? I love the soft body physics and the more realistic controls (like actually shifting gears to go forward/reverse and shit)."

College will be very difficult if you don't like what you do. If you enjoy the work, it's just a blast. You will see people cry because they couldn't cope, and you get a really thick skin from presenting and getting torn apart on a regular basis. I loved it, and would love to go back. 

My experience working has been they value previous experience much more than a college degree. That being said, if you can't find a paid internship offer to volunteer at one of your teacher's firms or any you come across. Spend time putting together a portfolio, practice your interviews with people, and you'll do fine. 

Getting a license needs to be done under someone that already has theirs and is willing to do the extra work for you, because it puts a burden on them. If you don't graduate from a certified college you're required to work 5200 hours under a licensed architect, if you do I believe it's 3200. I'm not sure that a license is required in this field because I work on my own without one and have a firm rubberstamp my work. 

Jobs are very competitive. There are a lot of jobs but even more people fighting for them. The people offering the job will try to offer you less money than the job is worth since there's so much competition. Don't let this discourage you, as long as you keep looking and be flexible (I've worked in PA and NJ while living in NY) you'll find something you like. 

I really love my work so all the hardships have been worth it to me. I'll keep this account for a while to answer any questions if you have any. 

Quick edit

I graduated three years ago and have been working constantly since. I don't want to sell an architect's license short because I don't know the full value of one yet."
"I used to live next door to the space that is now the Hyde. It’s fairly new, and I’m glad I moved because it blocked my apartment’s ocean view. The restaurant at the Hyde has a lovely charcuterie board, but the parking is a nightmare. If you’re ever in South Florida again, message me, and I’ll give you a list of hotels you’ll love."
No worries. Good luck!
I kinda disagree with Aamir. He comes across as petty and micromanaging. Some of the things he pushed forward in his TV show made me question his intelligence. The rest seem on point though.

Hello. I see that the Gateway 15.6” with the Ryzen 5 3450U and Vega 8 graphics is also listed on your gaming laptop post as well. Is the HP 15” with Ryzen 5 5500U and Vega 7 also suitable for gaming? Which is the better buy if both are listed at the same price?
Zinc and fluids.
