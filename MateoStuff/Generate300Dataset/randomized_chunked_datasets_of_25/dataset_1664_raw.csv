Which Frigidaire refrigerator would you recommend?
"And I'm saying it's quite likely to be in a lot of people's top five, considering it's easily in the top five in terms of ratings. And this didn't happen with Black Widow, lol."

A lot of lonely people going on vacation to end their life. Happens a lot but is never mentioned on the news.
"Depends on where you are at... in Alaska, once you are out of Anchorage they all suck."
"Definitely the first Test Drive Unlimited. I still find myself going back to it. 


A big open world with great variety in races and roads, not to mention the amount of cars that are modeled with accurate interior and details like changing acoustics depending on speed and weather. At least for a racer at the time. Granted, the handling at launch wasn't the best and controller support was/is lacking, but the Gold Edition with, i think it was called ""Hard Mode"" or Simulation, was fantastic in terms of driving feel, especially with a wheel.


 It also had an online component that I'm absolutely missing today and that was the racing Clubs you could create and join. Of course other games did similar things, but here you practically had Clans that organised specialised Tournaments and competitive leagues for all the different car classes and tastes. That combined with an actual auction house and economy, estates, club houses and garages really immersed you in the game. 


Now with Forza Horizon 3 on PC, the graphical fidelity has been surpassed, but I feel the community aspect just hasn't been successfully recreated in any arcade/semi-sim racing game since. Similar to SWG as an MMO. Forza also misses a lot of small QoL features that TDU had. Partly animated dashboards, windows you could open, fully customizable radio etc. 
The Progression in TDU was also a lot of fun. 


If you want to try it for yourself, there is a Mod that reenables FreeRide and online cruising and the launcher has several tweaks that make the game more playable on modern systems. You can get it through the [Turboduck Forums](http://forum.turboduck.net/threads/29561-test-drive-unlimited-project-paradise-v003a-public-beta-available)
If you have a PSP, pick up the disk somewhere, since it's one of the most enjoyable hand held racers out there. Apart from the low resolution of course."

"Don't bother, it's really racist and people are excessively anal about everything.

Just kidding, it's awesome.

Immigration is a hot topic, but small wonder with 24% foreigners (not including foreigners who got a Swiss passport). What some people could see as fussy and pedantic has the positive effect of the whole country functioning well, being very clean, and people being pretty considerate."
