I did not think that I could find someone who made comics so deeply depraved that even I would get slightly uncomfortable, but I am impressed and traumatized. Have a great day and please do not seek psychological help until it is absolutely necessary, lest we might be deprived of the horribly worrying art of a truly deranged mind.

16872,"Assuming you realize that you will be taking care of the pet (and do the appropriate research and decision-making), crested geckos are great, fairly low maintenance pets. Most tolerate handling very well, if your daughter is comfortable with (cute) reptiles and gentle with animals. I suspect that this suggestion will be a bridge too far, but snakes (corn snakes are great for beginners) and tarantulas are also extremely low maintenance pets--depending on everyone's comfort level.

The reality is that despite your daughter's passion right now, you will most likely participate in most, if not all, of the pet maintenance--or at the very least, you'll be pestering your daughter to keep up her end of the deal. I think it's fantastic for kids to have pets and my son has plenty (reptiles, fish, and insects are his passion) and he actually takes care of them pretty well at this point (he's 13), but even with his uncommonly dedicated pet maintenance routines, we still end up having to pick up the slack on occasion and remind him not to neglect his animals. And this is a kid who has been obsessed with animals since he could talk and received his first snake when he was five years old. We've let him keep a number of pets in the years since because he's proven himself capable of taking care of them--mostly. But no kid is flawless--they have a lot going on. Don't ever agree to get a pet unless you're willing to step in and make sure it doesn't die of neglect--or take over its care when your kid is away at camp, or whatever.

All that said, if you can manage to take on a bit more responsibility to get your daughter a pet, do try. My parents let us get a lot of small animals (fish, turtles, newts, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits) and I cherish those childhood memories. They never did let us have a dog or a cat, however, and I yearned my entire childhood for the kinds of experiences my friends had with their furry companions/confidantes. I still hold it against my dad a little bit that he was so adamant about not wanting the mess and fuss of a dog when, as an adult, I now know how much they bring to my life and positively impact my mental health. My son's relationship with our oldest dog is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. They've been together since my son was 18 months old. They're best friends. I'm so glad I was able to give my kid what I never got in that way.",best pet for toddlers
