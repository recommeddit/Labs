I loved his [‚ÄúSleep Is Just Death Being Shy‚Äù](https://youtu.be/-mu780uB7mI ) video so I highly recommend that channel.
"This. Most every local university has an online option now. Go with a traditional school and you'll get a degree worth something. Some of the online only schools are ok, but many are a waste."
"Awesome, thank you for the info!"
Maybe one day there will be libraries other than axios that are maintained
"For the love of God, Watch The Prestige!!!!!!!

Edit: How has only one other person brought this movie up?"
"Volkswagen ID3 and ID4 and their Skoda, SEAT, and Cupra equivalents are strong contenders. As is Mustang Mach-E.

Audi, BMW, and Mercedes also bring new cars next year.

Out of those, I am currently most interested in the Mach-E. Though it is unlikely I can afford a car that costs more than 40k‚Ç¨, and they all pretty much do because of how much taxes we need to pay for a car."
"My girlfriend's mom lives in a house on a private island off of Miami Beach.  The girlfriend and I are down there on vacation last summer and I am fixing the tail light on her mom's car when I see Lenny Kravitz walking up with his little dog.  He says something along the lines of, ""I have never seen you around before.""  I said I was visiting with my girlfriend.  I will never forget this ""tall chick?"" ""Ya.""  Then he got this big smile on his face and said, ""right on."" He high fives me and walked away.  At that moment I knew what cool was and I knew I would never have it."
"I'm the same way- LOVED Aniz in Parks and Rec, but otherwise I can't stand him."
"I mean, you said you needed to look at the source for many options, and having to ""figure out"" documentation is always a big red flag - documentation should aim to be as explanatory as possible. It sounds to me that, while it's complete in terms of having plenty of features, it's by no means complete in terms of usability and maturity.

It's harder to make a straight comparison to node-fetch, given that node-fetch is just a polyfill, and so can just refer to the documentation available for the APIs that is polyfilling. That said, the MDN documentation for the official fetch API is a gold standard, and I would far rather deal with a tool that contains fewer conveniences but has MDN-level documentation, than one that will inevitably have me fighting through source code and confusing documentation to find an answer."
"Not sure, I ordered a skoll and cancelled it before it got here üòÇ wish I had bigger hands bc I did love the model D"
"My dad, for years, had mentioned wanting to go kayaking, just around a lake or something. I found a place that does rentals on a nearby river (really, calm, no rapids at all) and paid for a 15 mile/5 hour kayak float trip. It was super cool, but going out on the water on a mid-June afternoon kinda sucked. My parents liked it so much they went and bought a set of kayaks and go out kayak fishing pretty much every weekend now."
Mark Rober: *cries in bg*
"Given one of the top rated threads has people saying they prefer the canals in Las Vegas to Venice because they don't smell (of the sea?  IDK I've never managed to get a whiff of what offends people), even this place has issues with 'real' and 'authentic' sometimes ;)"
Reads like a billboard ad
I just bought a new one that is 1:1. Much better than the old tech. Taste is amazing and they last a long time.
"My current top 10... 
1. Pandemic. Preferably Legacy Season 1, but vanilla works just fine

2. Dominion. I adore deck builders in general, and dominion is still my favorite. 

3. Race for the Galaxy. Still one of the best Role selection games I‚Äôve ever played. Just the right length and depth for me. I try to only play one expansion at a time. If you‚Äôve never played this game, look up Keldon‚Äôs AI. It‚Äôs admittedly too good, and I can only beat it about 50% of the time after 2 years of playing, but it‚Äôs still one of my favorites.

4. Carcassonne. I mean it‚Äôs Carcassonne. What‚Äôs more to be said?

5. Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small. It‚Äôs a great 2 player game. Get the expansion and never play without it. It ads enough extra variety that as long as you don‚Äôt play every day, you‚Äôre good. 

6. Codenames or Codenames: Pictures. Either way is great. Currently I‚Äôd suggest pictures just b/c it‚Äôs newer to me and more exciting at the moment.

7. Bananagrams. This and Unspeakable Words are the only two word games I enjoy. Having a larger vocabulary doesn‚Äôt automatically win bananagrams for you. You need to be quick and often medium and shorter words are more useful for you. Quick silly fun.

8. Pit. It‚Äôs a classic. Certainly the oldest game in my collection (not counting my nearly exclusively decorative chess set). Plays quickly, plays a pretty wide number of players well, and it becomes raucous fun nice and quickly. 

9. Sushi Go. I recommend spending the extra 5 or 10 to get Party for the variety. Quick drafting game, fun, cute, and simple. Always a joy to play for me.

10. -Monopoly- Just kidding, gonna give this as a tie to Lanterns: The Harvest Festival and Splendor. Two simple games that I had no trouble getting my non gamer family into. Simple to play, you watch a collection of cards grow in front of you and trade in sets for a tile or a more powerful, permanent card. Look nice on the table, and those chips from Splendor are a joy to handle.

Edit. Guess I offended someone. Sorry about that"
Both used.
"Definitely this on both accounts. Typing notes is awesome (they stay synced on all of my devices because of Dropbox), and if you use PDFs of your textbooks, just having your laptop with you means you have all of your notes/homework/textbooks/etc. with you

Still, I'd bring a backpack because it's annoying to carry your laptop or w/e in your hand when you're walking long distances"
Never been to NY so I stand corrected ;)
"The Lifeproof case is great, it's saved my phone from several 4 foot drops onto tile,concrete, asphalt....
It's much slimmer than the 5 version too.  It adds just enough thickness that the phone feels less flimsy!"
"A lot of people have brought up how the war itself impacted the civil war, but as far as the war itself: in my history class they were pretty honest about it just being a land grab that was weakly justified to take things from a neighbor that we had a military advantage over. I don't remember all of the details on the annexation of Texas, but even if you think that's justified, there was no reason to take the other territory other than the US wanting it and being obsessed with Manifest Destiny at the time."
"I checked out the Polestar 2 recently (online) and it looks pretty awesome. Definitely more expensive than what I'd like, but with the federal tax incentive and potentially the state incentive, it would bring it down to about the same as a LR Model 3. Definitely worth considering... I just wonder if there will be issues that come out later on about the Polestar 2 like there have been with Tesla (mostly referring to customer service experience)."
But it‚Äôs such a great value!
