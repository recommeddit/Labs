But really Nalini Singh, must read. Contemporary, paranormal, urban fantasy, suspense thriller with a light romantic thread, you name it, Singh has written a book in it. Give me a request and I can dig up a Singh rec for you.

Any day now, I expect her to drop a historical romance and just complete my life, lol.. 

Also, Shelly Laurenston,  I wanna be her heroines when I grow up. Batshit insane, and truly terribly hilarious, and unapologetically violent. And her heroes are equally ridiculous.  I üòç her so much!!!!",best romantic novel

Some measures and a shopping trip later I own a bra two band sizes smaller and two cup sizes bigger. I didn't know how comfy a wired bra can be! No more empty cups when leaning forward or even lying down.

Edit to add: I actually cried when I got my first well-fitting bra. I don't have weird or ugly boobs (what I thought since puberty). I just had the wrong bra. Fifteen years later, I finally am content and feel sexy. And I wish this for every woman! Don't underestimate what a bra can do for your comfort AND self-esteem!",best items under $100

22438,"James Corden. I was a porter at a hotel a very long time ago, he'd had a couple of very minor TV roles. I had no idea who he was but others did. He came down in the morning yelling at the receptionist that someone had taken vhs tapes from his room. He demanded to know who had access to his room, me being the only person on duty that night with a master key was pointed out and he proceeded to accuse me of sneaking into his room while he slept and stealing tapes. After ten minutes of verbal abuse and threats one of his ""people"" came in and told him they found his tapes in the car and he stormed out with so much as a goodbye.
