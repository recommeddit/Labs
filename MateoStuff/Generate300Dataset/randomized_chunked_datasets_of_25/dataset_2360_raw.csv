"Bang Blue Razz just has a nice classic blue raspberry taste that isn’t overly sweet. Reign’s Orange Dreamsicle is good but a little too chemical tasting. There’s a few other really good Bang flavors (Cherry Blade Lemonade, Purple Haze, Black Cherry Vanilla, Cotton Candy, honestly pretty much all of them except Miami Cola), but I think a Blue Razz Bang is probably my energy drink king."
I tried mixing a few different things with Dr. Pepper the other week but I found that nothing tasted as good as just unadulterated Dr. Pepper.
Fiji is the only water I've paid for that I felt was worth it. It also has the best shape for putting in an airplane seat holder.

It seems to alternate every time I hear it.  I was going to go m's but I watched it again to double check and heard n's this time.
"My university offers a service where they will find *any* published document in the world, free of charge.

Maybe your university offers something similar? At the very least, they should provide a library that has all the newest publications of respected journals in your field."
The Civil War should be required viewing for all Americans. I can't think of a more moving viewing experience.
"It's an action-adventure film with a romance in it. The primary elements are the kidnapping and related action, the romance is secondary. Also, OP specifically mentions not just typical action adventure films. Agreed it's not as good as Raiders, but who the hell hasn't heard of Indiana Jones and really needs it recommended?"
"i read somewhere once where someone was struggling with a similar thing and was venting to their therapist, to which their therapist was like, yo, just eat whatever you want for breakfast... you’re trying to be healthy, practice self care, and hate typically breakfast foods? just have a veggie wrap 

that shit made me rethink my whole start-of-the-day regiment and now i like the idea of nuking one of those steamable veggie packs and hitting the road"
"Ive always thought ""candy"" is exclusively for non-chocolate sweets. I wonder if its because I grew up in Australia and New Zealand"
This is some Junji Ito quality shit right here
No way. Wasn't expecting that at all. My school offers accounting with concentrations in either information systems or professional accountancy. What do you think is better?

"There's is ok, plus it's really cheap so I can always store a couple of 40 packs in my car to hand out to homeless people at intersections while going to and from work"
