"Because it is rated lower by this group of people than BGG at large.

There are a lot of games in this list that have a certain bite to them that keeps them out of the BGG top 100. There are 18xx games, a few more cult classic type games, and there is a bit more focus on heavier games.

Because there's also no Bayesian smoothing happening to the rating here, it allows less played games  to go higher in the ranks. If you look through the list and see games that are rated much higher here than on BGG, it's usually a combination of a slightly more dedicated crowd, and, again, classic games that have withstood the test of time.

Lords of Waterdeep, to me, is not remotely a stand out game. It's not bad, but a bunch of other games do a very similar thing about as well as it does them. 1830 or Indonesia or Sidereal Confluence, however, have a bit more uniqueness to them."
Non-smoked pulled pork?  Heathen.
"It has an 8 on IMDb, and even a 3.9 on Letterboxd. People really like this movie. Not sure why you're trying to deny this."

"Rode in a friend's Model 3 recently.  Hate the styling and the tacked on tablet dash design, but the tech parts are where we're headed IMO. Loved the torque/performance and self driving stuff.

I don't know if electric will get replace things like delivery vans or pickups used to haul, but I don't think we're too far away from an electric fitting the bill for your average suburban family SUV buyer, especially in cases of a multi-car household where the other vehicle is still ICE or hybrid.  Cost and the required behavioral change is the biggest hurdle there. 

To get to further adoption than that, we're going to have to do a lot of work on charging speed and range for consumer models.  I don't see people who only own one car or do a lot of traveling in rural areas replacing an ICE unless they can get a quick 'fill up' on basically any corner.  That's an infrastructure/battery question rather than just EVs though."
"If you have the resources, just enroll in your local community college (after checking the library to ensure that they have the subscriptions that you want). Then, if you don't want to take any classes, drop them the next day, before the semester even starts. You may lose a bit of money depending on the policies on course fees at that school, but you'll have a legitimate login for some pretty comprehensive databases. Also student discounts to movie theaters, etc."
"Here is a similar list from 10 years ago: [Compilation of top anime of the decade lists around the internet – Series](https://aquabluesweater.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/compilation-of-top-anime-of-the-decade-lists-around-the-internet-series/). 

This one includes anime from 2000-2009 only so the results aren't directly comparable. But many of the anime on the older list are still present on this newer list."
"I have a cuddly toy sabretooth tiger, and my daughter is regularly rough with and mean to him. We've told her we're watching how she handles him, and that while she might want a pet, she's clearly not capable of coping with one yet.

(In practice, we know it would be our pet, not hers. But we still need her to be nicer and not so rough.)"
"My power pack is an AUKEY PB-Y13, PD 3.0, 10000mAh, 18W per output.  PD-2, Quick Charge, Compatible with my Pixel 2, GoPro ...  197g

I paired that with a Aukey PA-Y16. High-Speed Charging, PD2 compatible, AC Blades fold in.  Up to 18W each port. 54g

To plug everything in, I pack two Anker Powerline USB-C to USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 Cable (3ft) with Power Delivery"
"Saw this article posted in another programming subreddit. One person complaint that they didn’t like using a function called ‘fetch’ to do post request, another didn’t like that the response from is not automatically parsed into json.

Different folks different strokes, I guess."
"Pretty sure it will be between him and Donald. Every list I saw from other rankers and my own had those guys 1 and 2.

Even for me it was a real tough call. Removing as much homer bias as possible it was really very close between the two. I swapped them back and forth a few times."

"I disagree. The number one reason why I've thrown away/RMAd mice is because the switches developed issues.

Optical switches might not ""feel"" as nice, but that's a trade-off I'm willing to make for better durability."
"I buy games for my pc when they’re multiplayer or will are really pushing the limits visually, or I want to stream it. I get games for ps5 when i want to play on my couch or co op with my wife or if it’s exclusive. I double dip on a lot of indies on my switch as well"
"I've been to, technically, three parks.

Six Flags New England is my ""big"" home park. Staff is friendly, park is small enough to get around, even if the layout is a bit wonky, but big enough to have plenty to do. Also, Wicked Cyclone and Superman.

Six Flags Great Adventure is... monstrous. It's a huge park, with a HUGELY varied set of attractions. El Toro is king. The staff is pretty good, dispatch times can be hit or miss. Did I mention El Toro?

Six Flags St. Louis is weird for me. I was there for an off-season tour last year and it wasn't fully opened. Just Mr. Freeze and American Thunder. Justice League, too. Seems like it's a cool park, and would love to visit it in full swing.


Out of them, I'd probably vote SFNE... But El Toro is so damn good, it's worth the 2+ hour drive alone."
Infinity War is down at 83% so it didn’t make the cut

"Yeah. Bradman basically is that trump card which works everywhere. You can make the crappiest of batting line ups and put Bradman there and suddenly that team can probably beat any other team in the world.

"What happened at MM? I didn't have the best experience either. Nothing personal happened, the park just sucked for me lol"
Not a California resident so I don’t get most of these but they seem really creative and interesting lol
