22689,"Mel would come into my friends work all the time and just sit next to the guy to shoot the shit. My buddy is an chef at a country club and because it was so slow he would just sit at the computer for hours on end and do admin type stuff. Mel would walk into his office, flop on a chair and chill out for an hour or two. Then leave. My friend would get annoyed because he had work to finish before leaving. It became a bit of an exaggerated joke between us about how annoying Mel is.",best celebrity

Everyone should have a limit he wants to spend on a headphone. And you can find very solid options in every price bracket and in every category.

So I wouldn't advise someone to buy a 300$ headphone, even though he could spend a ""kilobuck"" on his first pair. You wouldn't buy anything expensive without having a listen before or the option to send the item back anyways (or at least you shouldn't ;))

At least thats my opinion  ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ

Further I think that fullsize-sealed and portable options kinda go together because if you would care for portability you'd go with earphones anyway.
I've seen several people walking around with M50s, Dt770s and HD-25s on the streets/bus/train/plane/... None of them overly portable but they seem to work wonderfully.",best headphones

As you can see, I strongly favor turn-based JRPGs/tactical JRPGs. I only have three action RPGs on my list, and none of these developers are Western developers. I just think RPGs are done better in Japan in basically every way, but especially in terms of gameplay. Also, my list is not a hard top 10. These rankings shift around often.",Best RPG game on PS4
