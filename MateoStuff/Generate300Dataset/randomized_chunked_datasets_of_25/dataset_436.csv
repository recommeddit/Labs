36856,best roller coaster at six flags,Just ride everything. If you really don't have time then dark knight coaster is pretty skippable and green lantern is horrid.
4183,best text editor,"Visual Studio Code (*not* Visual Studio, which is a full IDE) works quite well, with C/C++ plugins. Try it out: https://code.visualstudio.com/

If you don't like telemetry, you can disable it by editing configuration file or just try VSCodium (https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), which is Visual Studio Code without Microsoft branding and with disabled all kinds of telemetry.

Both are free to use."
22689,best celebrity,"Mel would come into my friends work all the time and just sit next to the guy to shoot the shit. My buddy is an chef at a country club and because it was so slow he would just sit at the computer for hours on end and do admin type stuff. Mel would walk into his office, flop on a chair and chill out for an hour or two. Then leave. My friend would get annoyed because he had work to finish before leaving. It became a bit of an exaggerated joke between us about how annoying Mel is."
735,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,"I detest it. And it's sort of an inside joke between us employees how gross it is. (But maybe that's because we're not two years old.) However, the people that order it range from toddlers to young women to butch bearded motorcyclin' dudes soooo, to each his own."
6732,best iPhone,That’s my least favorite model to date. Too heavy for one handed use.
2628,best headphones,"If interest is there and money to spend, why not get something nice~ 

Everyone should have a limit he wants to spend on a headphone. And you can find very solid options in every price bracket and in every category.

So I wouldn't advise someone to buy a 300$ headphone, even though he could spend a ""kilobuck"" on his first pair. You wouldn't buy anything expensive without having a listen before or the option to send the item back anyways (or at least you shouldn't ;))

At least thats my opinion  ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ

Further I think that fullsize-sealed and portable options kinda go together because if you would care for portability you'd go with earphones anyway.
I've seen several people walking around with M50s, Dt770s and HD-25s on the streets/bus/train/plane/... None of them overly portable but they seem to work wonderfully."
62691,Best RPG game on PS4,"1. SMT: Persona 5 Royal
2. Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age
3. Dark Souls (Remastered is the best version)
4. Demon’s Souls
5. Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions
6. Disgaea 4 Complete+
7. SMT: Nocturne
8. SMT: Persona 4 Golden
9. Dragon Quest XI
10. Bloodborne: The Old Hunters Edition

As you can see, I strongly favor turn-based JRPGs/tactical JRPGs. I only have three action RPGs on my list, and none of these developers are Western developers. I just think RPGs are done better in Japan in basically every way, but especially in terms of gameplay. Also, my list is not a hard top 10. These rankings shift around often."
45391,best gaming system,I honestly tend to feel the opposite by virtue of only able to move in 8 directions vs the whole sweet 360 range.
56800,best desktop monitor,"Definitely get IPS. That's really all you have to look for. Secondly make sure it has the ports you want and you might not want a glossy screen, but that's preference."
28013,best breakfast foods,Where I live waffles aren't a thing :( we have only recently started getting fried chicken and waffles in restaurants based on american food!
13900,best research paper archive,"Great tool to put learning to the masses.

I have donated to SciHub because they are awesome.

I also disable ad blocker on the open science sites."
9139,best toothpaste,"I currently have 3 canker sores. They're such a bitch. I really need to switch toothpastes and see if that helps.

Edit: Thanks for all your suggestions, I'll definitely check them out."
29071,best calendar tool,"Try [Lanes](https://lanes.io). It has a calendar view but you can drill down to weekly or daily view too

> Drag and drop tasks from a todo list, especially recurrent ones

Yep, possible.

Although it doesn't go deeper than daily, so may not fit your requirement for 5 or 10 minute slots."
3668,best college for research,"The dots definitely aren’t all the same size, and they’re also different shades of red and orange."
763,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,No kidding. Well I know where my fat ass will be all weekend
9216,best toothpaste,Contrarian! I like it
65742,best college in california,What no slugs!?!
60851,Best comedy show on Netflix,Ron White is pretty fuckin' great.
55760,best action and adventure novel series,"If you like YA I would recommend The Immortal Life of Nicolas Flammel series by Michael Scott. 

Or any of the series by Rick Riordan. 

My husband recommends David Eddings, the Belgariad series."
53986,best medicine for a cold,"I'm not allowed to drink orange juice, any ideas for alternatives?"
16400,best sunglasses for fashion,"Agreed! Dropped my pair here and there on surfaces that would normally shock me and they keep their integrity.  Also great glass lens, and boutique stores straighten them back to original condition for life."
41884,movies like Inception,Only seen only will see once.
33176,best energy drink,Right. Just not five hours worth.
70181,best major to study in college,Did they factor in whether or not those students had major related internships in college? that's a HUGE factor in todays post-grad world
266,best terminal file manager reddit,Why would you want to open it in sudo?
