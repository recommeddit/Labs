9090,best toothpaste,"This is 100% anecdotal and coming from someone whose teeth have always been in good shape (no cavities). But I also hate flossing, and never have, just put up with my dentist yelling at me for not doing it every time I go for my cleaning. However ever since I started using a Sonicare I got for Xmas 2 years ago, my dentist now congratulates me for my newfound dedication to flossing. Ha!"

69921,best major to study in college,"First of all, make sure you know what linguistics is first. It's not just learning a lot of languages and it's not learning prescriptive grammar/ style rules. Those are the two biggest misconceptions I see. 

Second, I would advise either double majoring or minoring in math/ statistics or computer science. A good deal of linguistics research looks at statistical models of language, and both statistics and programming will help you deal with your language data. In addition, Computational linguistics (my field) is pretty sexy right now and it's great if you love problem solving. It's also nice if you love linguistics but also like having money and eating not-ramen."
