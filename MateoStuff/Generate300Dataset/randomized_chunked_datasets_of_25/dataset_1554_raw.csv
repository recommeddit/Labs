I hope you guys never break up. It would make Century Club even more awkward.
FT people are the people I still talk to the most post-college tbh

"I love your list. Any particular thoughts on Polo Red Extreme and Chanel Allure Homme Edition Blanche? Those are two that I've had my eye on recently, but unfortunately retailers around me have stopped carrying testers for these."
Get a hamster. They are pretty easy to take care of and not very expensive. I wouldn’t get a dog they are a ton of work. We have 2 that we had prior to kids and everyday I wish we didn’t have them. They are so annoying but they are older so I can’t really just get rid of them since no one will take them. Plus the worse part is we travel a lot and it cost us $60 a day to kennel them when we do. Ughhh.
Legends of Runeterra cards game same Hearthstone?

Hashtag United got some votes.
"I love this part. My favorite part of the standard Economist article is when they say ""Of course, we believe in [free markets, freedom of speech, freedom of choice etc.] and so here's what the [President of US, UK, EU, Bolivia, etc.] should do.""

They're usually right."
"I was never really into Warhammer 40K at all, but I picked up Eisenhorn years ago and it was amazing. Dan Abnett is a fantastic author and since then, I've found myself immersed in all sorts of crazy awesome scenarios stretching across the W40K universe. I can't recommend him enough!"
Check out Bedtime Stories. They focus on supernatural happenings and events. Really good stuff!
"Die Hard

Terminator 2

Aliens"
"I played a bit, and it's not that much harder than piano. To play like Ton Koopman, that's hard, but that goes for every instrument: composers keep writing until they've written something that can't be performed."
Hi sorry to be a pain she said between 15.6 - 17inch if you have any recommendations would be appreciated she don’t mind going up to £700
I'm a little offended Infinity War isn't on this list.
A dollar or two
I bet you had to pay extra for all those Nitrates.
"I picked up a RAVPower 26800mAh PD Portable Charger about two years ago and love it. 

At this capacity, you won't find anything ""thin and light"", but this beast is powerful enough to charge my Google Pixelbook (Chromebook) and easily fast charges anything else I plug into it. Has served me well during many travels."
[this pillow](https://www.sleepcountry.ca/bio-soy-pillow/product/14BIOSFTPIL) gives me a great sleep every night and I’ve had it for years. Over $100 but they usually have this but one get one free promo on
Happy birthday! I LOVE jalapeno margaritas-sweet and spicy. Also love gin and tonic.
"Github and LinkedIn are sufficient. Recruitment doesn't really happen on the other platforms. You only need Facebook or Twitter to market yourself if you have something to market, like a blog or project you want to promote. Most people don't."
Oldboy.
"PC is my main platfrom. I barely touch console(ps4) except when I want to play coop.

On Pc mods, unofficial patches, customisable graphics are the reason I prefer it. Not to mention free online service."
"My Kindle, easily. Can't even describe how many hours I've blown away curled up under my blanket enjoying a good book"
