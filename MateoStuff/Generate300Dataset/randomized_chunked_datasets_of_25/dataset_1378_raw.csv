Fits the style of the album perfectly.
"I don't know that there's one most useful major, but I would say computer science is pretty useful.  You can do IT, development, or you can even do your own start up if you're good enough.  The skills learned with a CS degree won't be going away any time soon."
"Lol, you mean 10th best safety in the league Jessie Bates, like someone had him pegged earlier in the week?

In all seriousness, glad to see him fairly ranked here."
"White Russians basically taste like chocolate milk.

You can put a *lot* of vodka into a screwdriver or Cape Cod before you can taste it. The purpose of vodka is pretty much to take non-alcoholic beverages and turn them into alcoholic beverages."
You can certainly do that with a synth. I also have piano samples that can be manipulated to crescendo.

"It's not weird! Handing out candy is one of my favorite things to do, and I don't have any kids. I love seeing little kids in costumes being all adorable.

I've lived in my house a little over a year now, and last year I got my candy ready and got all excited and turned on my porch light and sat and waited and not a single kid came. I live on kind of a weird side street separate from the rest of the neighborhood, but I know there are a bunch of kids around. 

This year, I still bought candy, and I'm going to put a costume on my dog and turn on my porch light and hope for the best in the cold rain we're supposed to get. I see the same kids every day when I'm walking the dog; part of me wanted to tell them all where I live so they'll come get candy from me, but I also don't want to get arrested so I did not follow through. ""COME TO MY HOUSE, CHILDREN. I HAVE CANDY."""
Im a fan of nearly any fruit tree you like? It can be a pain cleaning up the mess or getting to it because animals but its worth it.
I haven't seen it yet but my sister has been a much longer Marvel fan and said it's her favorite.
A good quality backpack. I got a north face backpack when I was a freshman in high school and I have it to this day 10ish years later!

"Well HTML is undoubtedly necessary.

>What I want to know is, coming from Java/C#, what language should I pick up to start doing web stuff?

What were you doing in Java or C#? These days C# is very popular for web development in the enterprise world. Both Java and C# can be used as backend languages."
"I'm torn between ""The Game"" and ""Skeleton Key""."
"I'd looked for over 10 years but could never find one that didn't just want to play jazz. (or was older than my father) Just got this guy a month or so ago. He'd never even sat behind a Hammond before, but he's picking it up quick and he loves the hell out of it!. He's played lots of piano and really digs my Rhodes, too."
"Indeed.

**Village spoilers to follow:** I mean regardless of whether you feel it works or not, it's definitely related. The Village is about the way we cope with evil and pain. The society presented to us has decided to run from it, to hide, to pretend it doesn't exist. Misguided but well-meaning, they use fear as a tool to protect their families from the difficulties they endured. Of course they eventually find that evil can still infiltrate their primitive paradise from within."
"Season 5? Stop when that season is over. It's a great, well written show that goes off the ledge when he goes in the box."
