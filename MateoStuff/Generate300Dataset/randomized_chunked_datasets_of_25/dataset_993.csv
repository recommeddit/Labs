13208,best gifts for mom,"A HOT MEAL.  ALONE.  When I was a stay at home mom, I nursed and had the baby 24/7 pretty much.  (Ex wasn't exactly helpful; hence - EX)  I remember going out to eat with friends and/or family involved me holding the baby the whole time and eating cold food with one arm while trying not to spill it on my baby's head.  Then I'd eat as if I were in a timed competition, because I knew I'd need to nurse or do something with my baby that required both arms.  I never finished a meal.  So, as a former stay-at-home mom, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND allowing your wife to eat a HOT MEAL without a baby in her arms at least once a week.  It's like a little piece of heaven most people don't understand.  :)"
10571,best suitcase lock,Also if you really want to you can take the lower from a firearm and put it in there. Technically a firearm in a sense of law so it can be locked and TSA can't say shit
20294,best workout music,Ultimate Suicide is my PR song. Shits so fire
34265,best NFL player,How is he better than current TJ Watt
26716,best board games,"Same with Twilight Imperium (3rd and 4th), although there might be a bigger difference between those two."
65343,best phone service company,then you should be getting band 13 inside just fine then
27687,best bollywood actor,Shahrukh's last few films have been really bad but he still has a certain place in my heart. Hope he again finds the critical reception he deserves very soon.
20247,best workout music,[Call On Me - Eric Prydz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQSYo_pC-QA)
6629,best iPhone,"I am in the same boat, I also have a back up SE to limp by if needed. I am hoping I can wait till 2022 and they will have another small form factor phone. I don’t want something the size of a graphing calculator in my pocket."
19124,best YouTube video,NakeyJakey is pretty good
42882,best detective show,"Manhunt: UNABOMBER is a drama based on the real life hunt and capture of the UNABOMBER, Sam Worthington and Paul Bettany are fantastic"
73275,best Linux distro,"It does not matter if it was long since you mentioned a lot of important things! Sometimes , for example when I was looking for discord I think or another software it said that it is available for Ubuntu/Debian and I know that Mint is based on Debian but I was not sure if it would support. And that's what I meant with windows apps , to be able to find apps for the linux distro I will be using ( because it seems to me you cannot download the same apps on every linux).

&#x200B;

I will check out PopOS once I find out which one out of the 3 I prefer , in order to compare them. Thanks !"
65827,best college in california,">30-40k a year for a UC is out of the question.

You realize there's also CSUs, a few of which are better than most UCs. Half the cost too."
40431,best midrange GPU,"Just get a 1660 Super or if the 2060 Super is under 400 in Canada, get it. 

Don't buy a 5600XT unless you're willing to do all of those driver installs and updates. This year alone had a ton of updates from AMD's side for their GPUs.
(Also, Nvidia cards are more efficient than AMD)"
23520,best car racing video game,"Homologation not homogenisation but yeah. It makes sense in practice since it's what real race events are like (every car has the same engine, etc) but it's only fun if you want that ""the only thing that sets me apart from my competition is my driving skill"" sort of vibe. If you want the more street racing, all the cars are different vibe, then it's definitely not the game for you."
59585,best perfume,">I can tell you’re an experienced connoisseur of fragrance

Eh, been at it a little over a year but it's definitely something I spend time on every day.

> You are a stylish, extroverted person

Not really :/

>...who holds themselves to high standards. You present a strong but not narcissistic image of yourself to others.

Definitely.

>I imagine you’re between 28 and 38 and very successful in your profession. The warm, sweet, and woody elements in many of these speak to a more reserved, sensual side that you like to hint at but not display openly all the time.

Pretty close, I'm in my early 40's and am mostly pretty reserved except when I'm not.

>You’re quite fashionable

Not really...

>but warm, and very open with those you know well.

Pretty much."
19551,best YouTube video,Gotta rap for the Christian Youth!
52649,best hiphop album,Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury is easily one of the most underrated rap albums of all time.
65459,best phone service company,"I think it would also be nice to have a chart or tab for deals.  Common deals to look for, when to look for them.   

Also, for the services that are monthly, I'd make additional colomns.  $20/mo for 8GB on Mint is very misleading.  You need to add a ""3-month prepaid"" colomn, ""6-month prepaid"" and ""12-month prepaid"" so that these can be filtered. And this way all the price points are included.  

Not everyone wants to or can do short/long term prepaid."
9539,best toothpaste,Like what type of whitening? I use crests 3d white series quite a bit
26220,best politician,"Dick Nixon was a goddamn masterpiece. He didn't even have to have Congress on his side to be in absolute command. This may be a tired cliché by now, but he deserved to go down for something better than a stupid burglary."
44978,best items under $100,"Foot massager. No joke, these things make you realize why certain parts of your feet or lower back hurt after a long day at work. I started using one a few weeks ago and it's helped my posture and my ability to stay on my feet for long durations by leaps and bounds."
22043,best celebrity,"In a meet and great type interaction, it would be Jonathan Frakes.

In a professional interaction (I worked a related industry). The Dali Lama, All the monks I dealt with on that day would have to be the most polite people on the planet.

In a hey I've just meet a celebrity type way Steve Irwin."
36858,best roller coaster at six flags,"i don't personally mind GL, but certain body types don't take kindly to stand ups so the hate is understandable imo"
70636,best movies with a cool twist,Not to give too much away but it starts as a crime thriller and then takes a hard turn into something completely else.
