you’re into gourmand and sweet feminine fragrances and probably into self care or beauty as a whole (like makeup or skincare)
"Infinity War. 

The Empire Strikes Back of the MCU."
"Those are the best. Pull into the gas station, fill up on oil and check the gas.  Since it's burning a quart a month, it's always topped off  with fresh stuff, and doesn't need changing."
I have a spigen glass protector that fits well.
The Game.
"I'd recommend one of the chi-5 (the 5 dorms in the middle of campus).  Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa (the ""shorties"", 2 floors and kind of shaped like swastikas), or San Nic and San Miguel (the ""towers"", 8 floors).

FT (Santa Catalina) is about a mile from campus and surrounded by construction.  Manzanita and San Raf are on the edge of campus and quiet and not very social."
What that doesn’t come up in my App Store. Been tryna get it on mobile forever
"I agree that it's Khloe! I find Khloe annoying, but out of all of them, she's the one I have the most respect for. She seems to me to be the most supportive and empathetic."
It's called a flaming Moe
Which is crazy. Asics is murder on my knees. Literally gives me so much knee pain I am limping the remainder of the day. Just about any pair of Nike running shoes prevents any and all knee pain.
I'm from Edinburgh. Other Scots mistake us for the English.
Usually you can see a one page preview of a paper and have to pay for full access. This post is addressing cases like that.
"A bit more obscure, but the Chad Vader series.

It's a sitcom-style comedy following Chad Vader, Darth Vader's relative who works in a grocery store. One of the first high-production YouTube series many people have seen."
Back in sanjose my favorite place to go was round table but it seems they don't have a location here. What places would you guys recomend that is anything like roundtable?
"For British people, my friend's dad is a producer on QI, and he says Alan Davies can be a real dick to anyone he doesn't think is important enough.  David Mitchell is lovely though."
"I use cd, ls, find, cat, and rm"
I see you are not considering Anker as an option! Is it not available at your place?
"Miller Lite.

Of the basic/starter beers, this is the best of them."
"Making a murderer 
Evil genius’s 

Personally I liked the Pyramid code as it brought to light many things I had no idea about"
"> I let the kids pick.

Fuck that. I bought it and I'm a busy man. I slam that shit in the bag. Boom! You feel that? That was a full size son. Now get off my porch."
"Stick to the built in chromium edge browser. It's a high class browser with very good startup and performance. The RAM usage and CPU usage is far lower than Chrome (not the lowest but still the best). For privacy, it has built in privacy and tracking blocking measures which you can customize to your heart's content. Brave does use less CPU and RAM and has better privacy options, but I'd stick with edge and not waste any storage downloading extra browsers for Windows 10."
"I use the HP 22cwa and I think it's pretty good. The stand isn't the best (it's a bit wobbly) but it's IPS, 1920x1080, and 21.5"", which makes the screen look sharper compared to, say, a 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen."
"At my cousins wedding they had the butter balls with rolls and one of my aunts thought it was ice cream so she took a HUGE bite out of one of them without realizing it was butter. She was so embarrassed when she realized it and just said ""Oh I just really love butter!"""
Rudy!
