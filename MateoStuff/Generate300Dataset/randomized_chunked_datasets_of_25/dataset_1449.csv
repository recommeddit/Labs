55365,"[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) is basically this. Yes, it's set in space and all, but it's more of a humorous adventure novel than a sci-fi novel. I think it can appeal to almost anyone. You'll especially appreciate the early chapters.

Another great option is [The Sot-Weed Factor](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24835.The_Sot_Weed_Factor). A very funny ""history"" novel, and you'll never look at the early Pilgrims the same way again.

Also try [If on a Winter's Night a Traveler](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/374233.If_on_a_Winter_s_Night_a_Traveler) and [A Wild Sheep Chase](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11298.A_Wild_Sheep_Chase). They are wonderful.",best action and adventure novel series

73135,"If I understood correctly its more about the desktop and help files of the Distro than the actual distro itself.

 Of course it should be one .iso File, burn it to a USB stick with rufus (from windows, dont know equivalent in Linux yet), start it, install it, ready. Not something where you have to pick everything yourself.

I liked Linux Mint but it just crahed two times and I had to solve it with a reboot. I recommend the KDE desktop, its the most similar to Windows, beautiful and includes some useful tools and the ability to theme and change everything really well.

Atm I use MXLinux, before tried Mint and manjaro but manjaro has a divided reputation. It is based on Debian (the origin distro of many) and is pretty popular, without a company behind it. The KDE version is pretty new and there is only one type, but its the newest supporting new hardware.",best Linux distro

9004,"The active ingredients can differ. Stannous fluoride has been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride. [PDF source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1951625/pdf/pubhealthreporig00021-0087.pdf). Other toothpastes use sodium monofluorophosphate as their fluoride providing ingredient. You may notice some correlation between price and active ingredient, but it seems it mostly comes down to the marketing of the inactive ingredients. 

Here's a short list of some popular products and their active ingredient:

**Sodium Fluoride**: (most common)

* Aquafresh Ultimate White, Extreme Clean, etc.
* Rembrandt Intense Stain
* Crest (regular), Tartar protection, Crest Complete
* Colgate Triple Action, Colgate Total (also has triclosan)
* Aim
* Gleem
* Arm & Hammer
* Mentadent
* Sensodyne (also has Potassium Nitrate)

**Stannous Fluoride**:

* Crest ProHealth

**Sodium Monofluorophosphate**:

* Tom's of Maine Whole Care, Clean & Gentle, etc.
* Rembrandt Deeply White
* Aquafresh Cavity Protection
* Colgate Cavity Protection, Colgate Whitening Baking Soda
