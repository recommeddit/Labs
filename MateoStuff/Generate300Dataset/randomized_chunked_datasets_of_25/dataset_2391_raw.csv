"So you're walking through the French Quarter. You're wearing sneakers, sandals, suede shoes, or something that never needs to be polished. A man approaches you and offers to shine your shoes, and you refuse, because they are not the kind you shine. He says, ""Okay, how about a little friendly bet? I'll bet you [X dollars] I can tell you where you got your shoes.""

Of course he can't, you think to yourself. I bought these in a store out of town that he has never heard of before. So you take the bet. Then he says to you, ""Before I tell you where you got your shoes, I will remind you that I didn't say I would tell you where you bought your shoes, where you purchased your shoes, the store they came from, or the town you bought them in. Because where you got your shoes is on your feet, on Bourbon Street, in New Orleans, Louisiana. So you owe me [X dollars]."""

"Honestly can't really fault it.  I've thought about leaving Ireland but there's nothing hugely wrong.  Taxes are high,  but not Norway high,  weather could be better but having spent the year in Colorado and dealing with snow all winter I've grown to appreciate it here because even thought it gets to colder you can still do whatever you like outdoor wise (within reason).

"Were you hired to work for a company, or are you doing freelance type jobs where you bid on work? Would love to hear more about how to land this type of work. I only know basic JS/HMTL/CSS...and all I know about WordPress is how to use the CMS (but nothing technical)...anyways, I love learning about it, but it all seems fairly abstract and like any type of paying job is far out of reach. Haha."
"[Platt, ""Strong Inference,""](http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:3f8TlWK12EIJ:scholar.google.com/+platt,+strong+inference&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33).  It's about doing science.  If you're ever going to go into research, it's a really good one to read.
