33063,best energy drink,Downvoted for sanctimony.
68487,best science fiction novel,"But its definitely SOMETHING.  It's unique and stimulating.  It has an interesting twist.  And it's in interesting prose.  So maybe it didn't give you what you wanted, but it definitely is going to hit someone hard."
33113,best energy drink,"I don't anymore, Those NOS drinks were my favorite, I'd drink Monster if those weren't available, and because they made me crazy and I'd talk too much. Coffee is much better. Also, lots of sugar and calories, it adds up when you start getting old."
51680,best iphone case,UAG Pathfinder in olive drab.
60518,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Get ready to watch it in a loop for years lol, it becomes addictive"

69316,best major to study in college,"I changed my major from Animation to Film and Television and regret it. If I went back I'd double major in both, take Film so I could learn what I wanted to learn, Animation so I could have a job after school."
49119,best gaming monitor,"If you wanna go really exotic, I got a Pixio PX329. 144hz. I really like it!"
4254,best text editor,I don't give a crap about any text editor wars. I try out many as well. I still don't have a favorite one. Currently using micro as my text editor. The only one I'm really fawn of is ne. I vim and even emacs. I guess I just like them all. I just switch to another one. When I feel like it. Currently my main text editor is micro for now.

28956,best breakfast foods,"I was just recently introduced to them a week or two ago. Also somewhere my mom found premade, fresh biscuits at a place called cash and carry (don't know if they are national).

Definitely a good option. Especially if you have a lot of people."
4976,best home improvement store,I do this at Walmart. They had changed so many aisles this past year. The app tells me the location.
17762,best Kardashian,That doesn’t mean you should tweet a pic like that though. Khloe should’ve put her down with words lol
5740,best programming language for web development,"Again,

> Beyond the file extension and the syntax, they are **identical** and always kept at the **same** version.

Neither is ever ""newer"" than the other. They are the same."
60236,best freezer brand,"I've had both chest freezer and an upright freezer and wouldn't go back to a chest freezer. 60% of the contents of the chest freezer served only to keep the most frequently accessed items at a reachable level.

I would also not recommend a frost free freezer. A frost free freezer uses more energy and freezer burns food more quickly. You have to be more careful to keep the door properly closed with a frost freezer (use the lock). Even the smallest air gap on the seal will cause frost to form on the interior. You don't have to do a full defrost to keep the frost down. Whenever the frost seems to be building up I unload a shelf into a laundry basket with a towel on top or picnic cooler and scrape off the frost with a plastic spatula. The door is open for only a minute or two max and nothing gets much time to defrost. I haven't fully defrosted the freezer in 8 years. Another tip-- do your ""defrosting"" in the winter time and just unload all the food into laundry baskets and put it outside in the cold."
15710,best sunglasses for fashion,"Just got a pair of these on eBay, they are great quality"
66682,best soccer team in the world,There's always 5 other top tier teams at any give tournament so you're looking at best 1 expected trophy during your golden generation
61644,Best RPG game on PS4,"Both a great, ffx is better story telling but ffxv obviously has way better graphics. Of the two, id say play ffx if you are looking for a long rpg to spend tons of time in"
55590,best action and adventure novel series,"Seconding ""Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn"" by Tad Williams, and the Joe Abercromby trilogy.

Would also recommend Raymond Feist's Riftwar Saga (the first trilogy). And Terry Brooks Shannara trilogy (the first trilogy). Feist's characters from the Riftwar Saga (Pug and Tomas mostly) have stayed with me for decades."
66389,best soccer team in the world,That's a fake
71299,best movies with a cool twist,"I didn't put movies in that were (sadly) spoiled for me already. And this is a personal opinion but I know, Saw has an amazing twist, especially for it's time. Even if I know that Jigsaw was there the whole time, I was still shocked. It would've been in the top 6-7 for sure!"
36138,best alcoholic drink,"Sailor Jerry's spiced rum, cherry cola, and orange juice. It'll change you."
