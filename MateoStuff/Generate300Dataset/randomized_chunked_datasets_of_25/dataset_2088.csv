60317,best freezer brand,"I'm a huge fan of freezer paper over bags. It's cheaper, I've never had an issue with freezer burn, and it holds its shape better so I can stack items more easily. It can be a bit messier when it comes time to thaw, but I just put a plate under the package and have no problem. Rather than freezer tape, I just use regular masking tape to close the packages."

53701,best medicine for a cold,"Exactly. I hate when people continue with their stuff (work, school) when they're sick and then complain constantly that they feel like shit.  Take one day off and just sleep. You'll feel better the next day, and I don't have to hear you bitch."
18038,best Kardashian,"Kim- I really respect her hustle and her ability to take things in stride and just handle shit that gets thrown at her. Seems like the most level-headed of the bunch. She's a very sweet person. Seems like she has recently discovered an actual sense of humor which has been refreshing// Dislike how she tends to invalidate others' feelings and acts like her opinions are facts. Definitely has bratty tendencies. Not a fan of her style these days. 

Kourtney- IMO has the best style of the sisters. I like that she doesn't get taken over by fashion fads as much as the rest of them. She's good for a one-liner, has a very dry sense of humor (perhaps being with Scott for 10 years rubbed off?). // Seems like she is severely delusional. Has very little drive/work ethic. Way too flakey. Takes all of her Kardashian privileges for granted, yet refuses to do her share of contribution to the brand.

Khloe- Definitely the most grounded/in touch with reality. Seems like she genuinely appreciates what they all have and I suspect has always prepared herself for it to go away. I respect her loyalty and how hard she loves. Seems to have the most developed personality, probably because she didn't get by her whole life by just being pretty// Obviously gets way too wrapped up in her romantic relationships. She hasn't really been single since Lamar and I think it would do her good. She's very reactionary. Comes off as slightly unintelligent to me sometimes.

Kendall- I like how she kind of does her own thing from the rest of her sisters. She has a cool sense of style. She seems to be the only one to maintain a close relationship with Caitlyn, which I respect despite my feelings about a lot of Caitlyn's actions. // Kendall has literally zero concept of reality and makes no attempt to gain any kind of perspective. Maybe the most boring? I honestly don't have much of an opinion on her, positive or negative.

Kylie- Obviously has crazy hustle/business savvy as she is the highest earner of the fam. Seems like a very attentive mom and loyal partner. She definitely has a relatable quirky/goofy side that doesn't get shown on camera very often. // Seems very entitled. It irks me that she complains so much about being famous. Comes across very bland on the show most of the time. I really dislike her Instagram persona.

A couple of likes/dislikes on the family as a whole- They are all ride or die loyal for each other no matter what, and have kept family their #1 priority. Most other celebrities/people in the business seem to have nice things to say about them, which I think is pretty telling for an industry of people who could have easily rejected them. // They all have obviously had major work done, yet deny it which is super toxic. Zero chance those butts are all natural lol. I don't have a problem with plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures, but the fact that they have been lying for years about having them done is irresponsible. They also treat pets like they are disposable (except for a few) which really bothers me."
37234,best amusement park,"I think sometimes Cedar Fair will remove rides they don't feel is worth the maintenance cost, even when they don't have a replacement lined up. Us over here at KI just lost Vortex and as far as I know there are no plans in place to put a new coaster in its spot.

I get that ridership was probably low but it was still a great ride. I wish they'd not take prominent coasters out until they have a replacement lined up."
72527,best keyboard switches,"I've had push to talk on for years for this very reason! At this point It's muscle memory that if I'm talking while using a computer, I move my thumb to my PTT button. Even when I'm not using my computer. Or my mouse. And I'm talking to somebody IRL."

12198,best gifts for dad,"If this situation comes up if I have kids, I'm just going to tell them we can't afford that. The amount of weird shit and disappointment adults will put on their kids in order to not tell them that they're struggling financially or even just on a budget blows my mind. 

If my mom had told me ""you girls didn't get new bikes this year because we can't afford it"" I would have completely understood, but instead I had to labor under the notion that they hadn't realized we'd both grown 6 inches and were ok with us bouncing our knees off the handlebars, because anytime the question came up they'd just breeze straight past it instead of being honest with us."

Well, Gibbs hasnt been active for a while on social media or anything.
So it might take a while for Bandana to release, who knows ?

The few tracks thats been released after he came out of jail has been recorded before (im pretty sure about this) and was released by other artists like Harry Fraud for their tape."
