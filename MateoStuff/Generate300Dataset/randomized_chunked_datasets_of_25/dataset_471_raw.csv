"Rory McCann (The Hound from Game of Thrones). He was in Sydney, and I figured I never get this opportunity any other time, so I went up to him. He was very nice and shook my hand. He didn't want a photo, but not a big deal, was just cool to meet him! 

And this was like a few days right after his chicken episode where he was like ""I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room"""
"They seem legit to me, I'm hoping they're real because of how funny it is to see Pooh as such a dick."
The Ecstatic too.
"Nice list! You really think TFA is the worst huh? As a veteran, I think I have a soft spot for it."
There is no best Pokemon game as it is up to opinion. My personal favorite would be Black and White
I absolutely loved the Leftovers!!!! Itâ€™s a great series!
"Strictly Background - follows a bunch of people living in Hollywood that spend their days as background actors. A bit long, but so interesting. Most of the people seem a bit delusional and it's sad, but fascinating."
"Saas is not the same thing as Sass, by the way."
"More of a combination of individual books and series:

* Dune by Frank Herbert- I like the entire series but the original book is best.
* Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons.
* Ringword Series by Larry Niven - in fact most of his Known Space collection is good.
* Mission of Gravity by Hal Clement.
* The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey - started watching the show and read the books and they have really revived my love of reading which I have to admit has dwindled in the past while.

There are many more I hold in equal esteem but I will limit to the original request of 5."
"You save a couple of lines of code yourself, but pull in a library of a couple of thousand lines instead. I'm strong on re-usability but that was definitely not the best example."
">PFF basically says that Mack consistently wins his 1-1 matchups and that matters more to them and their rankings than raw sack numbers.

As it should. Sacks happen 5-15 times a year for most. Why in the world would we limit our evaluation to maybe 10 reps a year over the other 600 times they were on the field? Give me someone with no sacks winning 25% of the time over someone like Jarran Reed having 7 sacks as a DT while being fucking awful on the rest of his reps"
"I don't think there are too many beasts/monsters in the book, although the magical FBI agent does ride a ""ghost hound"", which is twice the size of a horse and can talk."
I haven't even heard of it.  I'm downloading it now and will try it out.  thanks for the suggestion.
"I mean the side bezels are a little much, but look at the forehead and chin combo on the new pixels. THOSE are bezels."
"""Is it better to die a good man or to live as a monster?"""
"Exactly. Except Michelle, I don't know her."

"Absolutely, if that description of Priest of Bones sounds good to you, then you will have a blast with it.

I assume avoiding Amazon is an ethical stance, and if so understandable. If you are ever interested in dipping a toe into LitRPG, message me and I can just email you the .epub file of Dive as a starter. Oh! Or check out Royal Road for free, completely non-Amazon reading. The editing on that site is...well, there isn't...but you get what you pay for, as the saying goes."

Poor Marla. That woman had a big heart.
Which is why I have a squeeze-bottle of absolute ethanol next to my sink.

"Bro as one of those low income people go and fuck upon thineself. Seriously. That EIC doesn't do shit except make sure we get enough money back to stay poor. 

You sir, need to start to be more concerned with the condition of your fellow Americans."
