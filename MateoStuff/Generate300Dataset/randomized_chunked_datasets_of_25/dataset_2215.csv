10386,best suitcase lock,This is what I did when I flew to/from Sweden. Double layered cargo pants and wore a hoodie and two coats. Took me what felt like half an hour to get all the metal off at the detectors.
36351,best alcoholic drink,"Red wine, I prefer Merlot but I'll drink whatever's there. 

Big Whisky fan but that can really dry out my wallet. When able, I'll buy a bottle of Highland Park, Old Pulteney or Glendronach.

Used to be a vodka and redbull drinker but that shit would make me go mental."

4741,best home improvement store,"(*)Rebate in the form of a Menard's ""gift card"".  

Since you mentioned them, I'll pass this 4th-hand info along: My wife worked at one of the others and pretty much to a man the electrical contractors who came to her store told her (and anybody who asked) to NEVER EVER buy electrical equipment from Menards. Something about being cheaply made and shoddy and failing way too soon and in some cases being outright dangerous."

15831,best sunglasses for fashion,"Another popular style is the P3/keyhole shape. This is another classic style that has become super popular in the past 10 years. [Here's a guide I wrote on the style](https://fromsqualortoballer.com/p3glassesroundup/) (they're my personal favorite). They're a great way to wear round lenses without looking anything like Harry Potter. 

Also, some of my favorite brands:

* aviator: American Optical
* p3: Garret Light, Oliver Peoples, Bespoke Dudes Eyewear
* Browline: Shuron"

34362,best NFL player,I know it's your opinion but mahomes is clearly #1.
30222,best Mexican war to study,I removed we learned about it but being so far away from the area it affected and how long ago it was I learned it I’m not sure on much of the details other than we fought over land. I think if I lived closer to the areas involved more details would have stuck. The civil war kind of dwarfs in lives lost and changes to the contra and how it functions and we spend a lot more time on that in school. Also I live closer to the areas affect and have visited battlefields and other sites related to it so it’s more prominent in my memory.
34649,best NFL player,"I know and I will just scroll past it. I'm just annoyed because I subscribed to the Athletic a few weeks ago because I was tired of this type of content and wanted ""meatier"" coverage of my teams. Now, when I go to the latest Giants articles, the featured article is Lawrence Taylor's ranking. I just think this type of content should be reserved for free sites"
