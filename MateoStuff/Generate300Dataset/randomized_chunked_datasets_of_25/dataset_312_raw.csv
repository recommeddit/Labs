How does it look now? Any better than a year ago?

"A wonderful dish, but people get pissy when you run the blender in the morning."
"Nice - Vince Vaughn on a plane, he was super nice. Also very doting you his wife and kids. Super tall.

Rude - Kevin James, he was so condescending and rude to his assistant. Didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the fans that wanted to meet him."

"> He was trying to teach us machine learning from day 1 for some reason i dont know.

Possibly a resume padder wanting to be able to say ""YEAH I TOTALLY TEACH MACHINE LEARNING TO LIKE 100 STUDENTS"""

">You also can't play the original on the 360 because the 40 button, 3 stick, 3 pedal controller is required to play, but is not recognized by the 360 as a control device.

Point made. This will be the one game that gets its own category.

Also, screw the ""sequel"""

seriously! Me too. Would love to see a small pickup as an EV.
I started with the Microsoft whatever 3000 and with good light it was acceptable.  One of the most important thing with a webcam is lighting.  You can make cheaper look better with good lighting

"Apparently there were no worthwhile recordings prior to about 1950 either.  

I kinda think it would be more credible if they just stuck to rock.  They don't know shit about jazz.   Look at their 4 token instrumental jazz albums:

* 79 - Miles Davis - Kind of Blue 
* 188 - John Coltrane - A Love Supreme 
* 303 - Charles Mingus - Mingus Ah Um 
* 323 - Miles Davis - Bitches Brew

Such brave choices.  They include these 4, but no other instrumental jazz out of the other 496 albums.... yikes.

NME should stick to what they know and stop posing."

True. Computer Science isn't only programming.
This is the thinky answer.

I was told by my mom that i should have a signature scent and after using this one, I never looked back. My roommates and friends all steal a spritz every so often and my boyfriend absolutely loves the smell"
"I never liked RT's rating system (seriously, Black Panther is #1 and Infinity War isn't even in the top 10...)

I find IMDb's ratings much more accurate:

Avengers: Endgame - 8.8

Avengers: Infinity War - 8.5

The Avengers - 8.1

Guardians of the Galaxy - 8.1

Iron Man - 7.9

Thor: Ragnarok - 7.9

Captain America: Civil War - 7.8

Captain America: The Winter Soldier - 7.8

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - 7.7

Spider-Man: Homecoming - 7.5"
"That's a tough one, because honestly I think cats and dogs are the best pets for youngish kids who want a pet you can ""pet"". When you say you don't have the space for a dog, can you clarify what you mean? I ask because many breeds of lower-energy dogs-- which is what matters, not the dog's size-- do fine in small spaces including apartments."
