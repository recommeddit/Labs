This thread is going to be delicious to browse soon.
"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He was walking out of the restroom at my work place. I commented, ""I smelled what The Rock was cooking"" as we passed each other in the hallway. He turned back and gave me the [People's Eyebrow](http://gifsoup.com/view/3738992/the-people-s-eyebrow.html). Actually got to chat with him a little while, and led him to the edit bay that he was looking for."
"or if you already bought a 2.0 model,[ this company](http://www.gourmet-coffee.com/Keurig-DRM-Freedom-Clip.html) makes a clip that 'hacks' it so that you can use any k-cup with it."
Are you sure she's not a well designed AI humanoid? I heard ok cupid is full of them.
"I donâ€™t understand anyone who thinks ATT is in the running for the best spot. Its coverage is no better than either of the others and its business practices are just horrible.

Verizonâ€™s business practices are shit but it at least has the best coverage to make up for it.

T-Mo is the best company to deal with by a mile and when you have signal, itâ€™s usually good signal (faster). Their coverage is not as good as Verizon though not nearly as far behind as they were a decade ago. If you spend most of your time in cities like I do, t-mo is a no brainer."
I bought two pairs of Shady Rays this year and they have been solid.  They will also replace them twice for free if you lose or break them.
because i want to build a web server for all my books
i am guessing none of these is available at a regular US grocery store except the tabasco?
Fuck off with your fancy pants ice cream! This is war
When Andy fires back at him asking who Kevin James plays lol
"Nose hair trimmers. 

My dad usually says gifts are a waste of money and that people should get useful things instead.

He uses that sucker every Sunday night. My brother's been trying to top it ever since."
Just finished the Office a few weeks ago. Planning to get the box set so I can rewatch it anytime. ðŸ™‚
R1 schools have PhD programs.
I personally found Mint better than BS.
70h? You mustve really rushed it. Im like halfway through the game and im at 75h. Im taking the time to max out all my confidants and level up
Can we start a list? I nominate peter Hamiltonâ€™s commonwealth sage
"Did the same as a kid, turns out you can basically max the specs on the starter miata so it's as good or better than anything else you get later in the game."
The [War of the Roses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses). That thing is confusing as hell. Bonus: Final Fantasy Tactics is based on it. The remake is even called Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions.
"In Scandinavia and island countries up North it's very expensive, a bottle of decent beer (were talking like domestic, nothing fancy) would be around $8-10USD at the cheaper places. I didn't even bother going to the nice places. They often had ""uni specials"" where you would get 5 shots for 100kroner (about 3.5USD each), which was the cheapest way I found any sort of drink at a bar. Thats why so much pre-drinking, and drinking on way since they don't care if you drink on the streets and such."
"**Snape, Snape, Severus Snape...**"
Get origins. Itâ€™s really beautiful and fun
"Hotel Sant Francesc in Mallorca. It used to be the mansion of a rich Spanish family, and it was converted into a hotel. 

Everything was minimalist yet decadent and beautiful. We got upgraded to a suite, and honestly I still dream about it."
"ARQ, The Endless, Upgrade, and Moon are a few I'd toss into the pile."
"My best friend has an online Bachelor's in Graphic Arts. He now works as a technical writer. He seems happy with his current gig, but I attribute it more to his strong work ethic and not necessarily his degree."
