36242,best alcoholic drink,"My dad and a buddy of his ""invented"" a drink in college they call the tootsie roll, which is a shot of orange flavored vodka in a big mug of root beer. Tastes just like an orange tootsie roll pop.

(No idea if they actually invented this, I'm sure they borrowed it from someone)"
6041,best Netflix documentary,"Icarus was so good, try to go in as blind as possible because it’s a wild ride. Athlete A is really well done and interesting but also upsetting because of content, but if you’ve enjoyed the Epstein doc then I think you’ll be fine in that regard haha.

Edit to add: American Factory and Voyeur."

26569,best board games,"Terraforming Mars has held the most replay value for me so far. The game itself takes a couple hours to play, but it’s always a blast and it’s somewhat of an evolution from Catan. It also has a decent solo-play variant. 

If you like Munchkin, Cosmic Encounter plays very similarly (you play attack-value cards and other players can add to yours to help you, or add to your opponents to screw You) but is considered a much better game. It has TONS of aliens, each with a unique power, and many expansions, so lots of replay value. It can promote some fun player interaction with trying to squeeze alliances out of people before backstabbing them later. It’s pretty widely loved in the boardgame world. 

Additionally, I’ve had a blast with Santorini. It works best as a 2 or 3 player game, and the games are usually quite quick; typically we’ll play 3-5 matches in a row before moving to a different game, but I’m always down for more so I think it’s got lots of replay value. 

Lastly, Codenames has the most replay value of the party games but you probably will be ready to move on after a couple hours. However, we’ve never gotten tired of bringing it out. So we’ll usually get a good 2 hours out of it in a night, then be ready for more the very next night. Not bad for such an affordable game (and Codenames Duet is supposed to be a great 2-player variant). 

I’d add that the “deeper” games like Agricola and Terra Mystica will have much greater long-term replay value, but they’re consequently more difficult to learn as a new player."
4541,best text editor,Wonder if VSCodium has arm64 builds.  I have official VSCode on my PC Ubuntu install (which is on an external SSD so I can swap it between my machines) but I wanted a good code editor for my Nintendo Switch (running L4T Ubuntu 18.04) and VSCode wasn't distributed for arm64.
70091,best major to study in college,"Right, if you want to go to college for something that leads directly to employment, which I am by no means looking down on, then this is the list to look at. However, as someone who love learning and doesn't mind doing all kinds of strange jobs (From managing a coffee shop to cutting trails in southern ID) then perhaps this isn't the list for you."
5473,best home improvement store,"> shit always goes wrong at night for some reason

Preach, bro. Thanks for the tip -- will definitely keep Trust Hardware in mind next time something breaks after hours."
37747,best Marvel movie,"He didn't say anything about ranking the movies ""OBJECTIVELY"", the OP just was sharing his SUBJECTIVE opinion on the films and asking others to share their own SUBJECTIVE opinions as well."
66085,best college in california,[/r/DVC](/r/DVC) has been created.
57032,best water brand,It tastes like what I imagine water particles in clouds might taste like.
43080,best detective show,House lives in 221B Baker Street. It's pretty on the nose with Holmes connections.
64779,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Joe's Cafe is a solid choice. Good menu selection, full bar and decent prices for a downtown spot"
11711,best gifts for dad,"I made my dad a toolbox when I was in junior high. He wasn't a construction man by any means but it was a school project we did. Either that or a birdhouse.

Fast forward 9 years and he started using it when building a new deck at our house! Kinda cool feeling to see it brought back out from the depths of my childhood."
21741,best winnie the pooh comic,"I was like ""aw man, this fucking repost again?!"" but then I saw the name. You do some kickass and creepy artwork, thanks for sharing it!"
7764,best laptop for general use,"Hi, my list doesn't include a lot of business grade laptops (since they rarely interest people), but they do have great reliability. The [**Lenovo ThinkPad E15**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/product/lenovo-thinkpad-e15-laptop-15-6-fhd-display-intel-core-i5-10210u-upto-4-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-nvme-ssd-hdmi-wi-fi-bluetooth-windows-10-pro/) is a solid choice if you're mainly doing general use tasks."
9031,best toothpaste,Enjoy saving up for the thousands of dollars you will spend on your teeth later.
23132,best social networking site for CS,"Creating accounts and leaving them empty let you control your online presence.

52066,best iphone case,"Just going against the majority here:

I just bought this case five days ago based on this recommendation. Arrived from amazon in two days, and now after 3 days the back has already scrunched up. When it came it also did not look new. Just a warning from a personal experience story

EDIT: since I now need a new one, was wondering if someone has a non-spigen case to recommend?"
24102,best anime,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is my #1, Anohana 2, K-On 3, then FMA B 4.

Also, give it a fair chance. I started off being like ""what is this shit"" but by the end of season 2 I was crying my eyes out."
10250,best pencil for drawing,"In that case, I would highly recommend going with Palomino Blackwing pencils. I work as an animator and freelance illustrator and they are probably the most popular drawing tool in the industry. They’re not mechanical, but they have the perfect smoothness and easily give you both light and strong dark lines."
