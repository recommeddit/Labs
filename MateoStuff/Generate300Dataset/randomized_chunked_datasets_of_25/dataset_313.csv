26569,"Terraforming Mars has held the most replay value for me so far. The game itself takes a couple hours to play, but it’s always a blast and it’s somewhat of an evolution from Catan. It also has a decent solo-play variant. 

If you like Munchkin, Cosmic Encounter plays very similarly (you play attack-value cards and other players can add to yours to help you, or add to your opponents to screw You) but is considered a much better game. It has TONS of aliens, each with a unique power, and many expansions, so lots of replay value. It can promote some fun player interaction with trying to squeeze alliances out of people before backstabbing them later. It’s pretty widely loved in the boardgame world. 

Additionally, I’ve had a blast with Santorini. It works best as a 2 or 3 player game, and the games are usually quite quick; typically we’ll play 3-5 matches in a row before moving to a different game, but I’m always down for more so I think it’s got lots of replay value. 

Lastly, Codenames has the most replay value of the party games but you probably will be ready to move on after a couple hours. However, we’ve never gotten tired of bringing it out. So we’ll usually get a good 2 hours out of it in a night, then be ready for more the very next night. Not bad for such an affordable game (and Codenames Duet is supposed to be a great 2-player variant). 

I’d add that the “deeper” games like Agricola and Terra Mystica will have much greater long-term replay value, but they’re consequently more difficult to learn as a new player.",best board games
