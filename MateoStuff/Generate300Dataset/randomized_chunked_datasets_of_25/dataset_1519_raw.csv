"Yep that's why I got my degree in English with Creative Writing concentration. I graduate in May, still looking for a job, but it was worth the 4 years. Plus, we have skills that many employers are looking for, like ability to think quickly, creativity, and most of us have a good handle on grammar and sentence structure."
"I just can't classify Outlander as a romance in my head. Don't get me wrong, I *love* the romance in the series, but IMO, it is too much of a mix of genres to recommend it as romance. Not saying you are wrong or that it shouldn't be on this list!!"

"This might sounds like a weird question - but what is the use case of having a file manager in the terminal?

I don't understand the benefits to using Ranger/MC/If - all my file management needs seem to be covered by built in bash commands.

How would you pitch this to someone like me?"

I thought [Harper's Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Island) did a decent job of this.
"I generally operate under a principle of, ""It's better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it."" Maybe the AC is too high or (come winter) the room is a tad drafty. But I've got a sweater in my backpack. I brought a sweater and don't need it? I won't accidentally leave it behind because in the backpack it goes. Maybe for some reason I need a pencil instead of the pen I always use. Maybe there's an interesting bird and I want to take a picture. I've got my camera. Maybe my phone is running low and there are no seats near outlets - I've got my power-pack. Left my wallet on my desk? There's a spare $10 in there for lunch. Long break between classes? I've got a book. Power goes out? Flashlight. 

But the marginal value of all that is low, so... whatever floats your boat."
I have two of them that I recently bought and love them. I'll buy another in a few months when prices go down.
"I feel like I may have gotten a dud. Mine like doesn’t fit in the case. It’s like the camera bump is slightly too big. I have to keep pulling the case over the corner like once an hour. I feel like if I drop it, the phone is going to fly out of the case."

"*More things to consider:
All panel types have problems. My IPS pannel has HORRIBLE backlight bleeding. Only noticeable in full black screens so not so bad. But when it's there it's horrible.
Oled would be perfect. IF THEY DINDN'T BURN
Colors usually suck. These companies produce tiers of monitors, some extremly expensive, others doable. A lot of times the doable monitors have the same panel as the super expensive ones. So to compete, they fuck the color corection. Can be fixed, but without the tool - it will never be quite right. Still, muuuuuuch better than shitty office desktops.*

Heh, so true.

Currently on rather okay Acer Predator display. Useless for movies, ridiculous backlight bleed at bottom. Very good for everything else tho. Even colors are pretty okay once manually calibrated a bit. HDR seems like crap tho.

Also tried Phillips hybrid between TV/LCD. Super nice sound, useless semi-ambilight, very decent HDR. Unfortunately really poor color balance across screen and piss poor backlight near corners (basically looks like there is almost no backlight, so it has heavy vignetting near sides).

Very good as movie machine, very bad as everything else. :D

OLED last fine about 7k hours .. and then they dont.

Sadly mix of good refresh rate, good colors, good backlight are probably impossible (maybe some high endDELL?). EIZO unfortunately seems to not give any care about Foris lineup. :/"
"When I say Power User, I mean that I regularly make 200+ character formulas and the spreadsheet can take 30 seconds to recalculate.  I think Power User is a useful way to describe the difference between someone who manually enters the numbers for a table (and doesn't use much of Excel's functionality) and a person who has multiple indirect lookups and 1000+ line worksheets.  The first person is not going to see much of a difference between Excel for Mac and Windows."
