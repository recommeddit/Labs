36155,best alcoholic drink,"Flaming Dr Pepper:

8 oz. lite beer

1 shot Amaretto

splash of 151


Fill a shot glass with Amaretto, and float a bit of 151 on top.  Light shot on fire, drop into the beer, and chug.  Tastes like drinking a Dr. Pepper."
64536,Best Nike running shoes,"A little more on the Zoom Streaks:
1. As of a couple months ago, I would say they were tied (with Adidas Adios Boost) for the most popular competitive marathon shoe. These 2 shoes are almost always seen in the front of marathons. I'm not sure if there was any shift when the Boost 3 and Streak 6 came out. 
2. I have worn 2 pair of Streak 5s. I love running in them, they are my favorite shoe I've ever worn. They were very light and supportive enough to train full-time in. The first pair lasted ~550 miles before some of the flywire started to break. The second pair lasted ~150 before some of the sole fell off. I switched to Streak LT3s and I don't like them nearly as much. I'm planning on getting the 6s soon, not sure if I'll wait for the LT3s to wear out or switch early."
12910,best gifts for mom,"I have to get Mothers day gifts for my wife, cause my kids are 3 and due in July.

I have my ""remembery stuff"" list, kept in a cloud based storage area, into which I paste everything and anything that my wife says she likes or wants.

That way, when a gift getting opportunity arises, I check out the list, which ranges from little £10 gifts to major things, pick something which fits the budget, something she wanted a year or so ago, and has forgotten all about, and get her that.

Boom. Gift is something she likes. Gift is something she has forgotten she wants. Gift is something i've remembered she wants. Everyone is a winner!"

36045,best alcoholic drink,"Semi-honest answer: soda water, sugar-free cola, or SF energy drink with spirits. You can get vodka made from pure potatoes if you're concerned about gluten, but it's pricey.

Brutally honest answer: phenibut, benzos, and GHB."

47736,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,When I took math you weren't allowed any calculator. All answers were either symbolic or exact. Undergrad math if that matters.

22272,best celebrity,"Wolfgang Puck. We went to one of his new restaurants, he was there checking the kitchen and going around to all the tables and asking how everyone's meal was going. It was my mom's birthday so he ordered her a free dessert (some sort of delicious austrian pastry). Cool guy."

13954,best research paper archive,You can use sci hub to bypass paywalls.
73720,best matte screen protector for ipad,Is it a matte (paper-feel) protector?
29181,best web hosting service,"I prefer to go with a control panel. It’s just easier, simpler and more efficient. I save so much damn time when working on my websites. I’m also leaning towards A2 at this point as the cost seems just about right, and will allow me to host more sites that I’m currently contracted for. But I’m not sure, I’m torn between that and SiteGround. Looking at your criteria, what do you think is the better choice? Both seem to have good reviews."
