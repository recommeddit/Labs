"For the smell:

Pull the carpet like you stated.  If possible open windows and doors to get fresh air in.  If the house has duct work (central heat or AC) have the ducts PROFESSIONALLY cleaned.  I had a house I bought cleaned, and it seemed like a gimmick for but for an extra 100$ they sprayed this stuff in the ducts that was supposed to kill bacteria and be a odor neutralizer.  It took the house from smelling a little funky (it was a vacant house for a while) to smelling like nothing.

I also have a air filter that is HEPA with ozone and UV.  That thing can really clear up the smells in a room.  Depending on room size, it can take a while, but it does help.

As others said, you can paint, and that can help, but washing the walls might work too before you paint (if they are nasty anyway, you will need to at least hit them with sand paper to remove grime before you paint.  It is much easier to paint an empty house, but you may not know what you want.

Places like Sherwin Williams offer assistance with picking colors.  If you are getting new furniture, some furniture stores will send out a design expert that can help you pick colors (I think Ethan Allen and Lazyboy)."
I hate that commercial so much
"An old one but it does keep surprising you: *Deathtrap* with Michael Caine, Dyan Cannon, and Christopher Reeve!"

Crepes with nutella and a warm waffle. Its glorious.
"Can't upvote this enough.

In addition to everything you've said, NC is quickly becoming a huge wine producing state. A lot of the tobacco farms are being converted to vineyards and the quality of wine being produced is very good; right now it's very similar to the Napa Valley scene in the 60s-70s. 

Most vineyards are still fairly small and if you go on a weekend you can oftentimes sit and talk shop with the owners as you drink some excellent bottles of wine."
"Much more milk than cream, both to work in the gelato machine and to balance out the extra fat from the ham. Whole eggs, cornstarch. Sliced the ham thinly, infused in the hot milk and cream for about 20 minutes, then hit with an immersion blender for maximum surface area. Strained after I made the custard and added a little scotch in at the end of smokiness. Was amazing with gooey chocolate cake and caramel."
"OMG blue Bell ice cream. Im vocal about my strong opinions on ice cream (it's my kryptonite) and about 10 years ago I was in Texas training for a job driving in the remote areas between Austin and Houston.  Randomly, my trainer asked me if I've ever had Blue Bell ice cream. I said no and mumbled some rebuttal on how my Yankee ass (WNY represent!) is very aware that Ben and Jerry's has the lockdown on good readily available ice cream. My trainer pulled over and ran into a gas station to return with two small individual tubs of blue bell, vanilla of course, so you can focus on the foundation of what these crazy ass texans THINK they know about what makes a good cold dairy product. I pulled back the lid and shoved that wooden tongue depressor in there and tried a bite. Damn, I still remember that day. Ben and Jerry's was dethroned as my grocery store go to. It was Been and Jerry's to me now. I sulked back to yankeeland, tail between my legs dreaming of when I might be able to travel South enough and cross the Mason Dixon line to the land of milk and honey and whatever else blue Bell puts in there. I confide to my wife about this discovery and moan every few months. God bless her, she tried but she never did understand that blue bunny ice cream is not blue Bell. Thankfully, I finally moved out of that second rate ice cream area and down to the good ol South. Grits are on the menu and I graduated to a DAMN Yankee. After getting a hankering I go down to the local grocery and start looking. Not at that one, go to another.. Nope. Go to the website and find out that my sorry ass moved to a rural damn area outside of their distributed zone. So I vow, one of these days I'm just going to get in the car and drive until I can go to a H.E.B. and pick up a case of shiner Bock and give myself diabetes by way of fucking ice cream."
"I went to a community college then a university to end up getting a bachelors and masters in Spanish, which you pretty much can't do online.

I had two friends do online college.

1 went to some unknown online university, spent $$$$$ and graduated and its not taken seriously because nobody recognizes it and its only online so I think some people don't trust them or something.  She has had a terrible time and she's in debt-a lot. 

My other friend went to an actual college that has a good online program.  She takes one in person class and the rest she does online.  It's called the PACE program for working adults but its an actual, accredited university here (she could in any semester actually take in person classes if she wants to or if something isn't offered online) and she is almost done and already has a job lined up. 

I think the difference is just respect for their effort (because who knows who did the work in the completely online classes) and recognition of the school.  Also, my friend at the actual university ended up spending less! 

Good for you for going back-just be smart about it! And definitely look into pell grants! And don't go to any school that isn't accredited.  

My ex boyfriends mother went to one of those 12 month nursing school things and it wasn't accredited so the only places that will hire her are the companies that work with that school...and she can't use the year if she decided to actually become a nurse, which she won't but it wouldn't even be an option to transfer.  

Good luck!!"
"Thinking you will get any viable answer here is naive. 

Alkohol will always fuck with your body and thus your workout the next day. Less alcohol means better fitness the next day. It is simple as that.

The only difference you can make is to drink lots of water and eat something before you go to sleep to refill lost supplements and liquid."
"It's a reliable metric if by ""best"" you mean ""most bang for your buck."" All of the top-ranked Forbes schools are still elite, after all; it's just a slightly different weighting of criteria."
"If you are talking about which has the best high-end hotels, they've nearly all got some good ones.

Marriott has a ton of great category 9 hotels which are amazing.  These are typically 'JW' properties.  They also partner with Ritz Carlton so you can stay there with marriott points.

SPG has very nice properties imo.  Some of the W locations in big cities are excellent, although I haven't stayed at many (i usually transfer SPG points).

Hyatt has a lot of great high end stuff, especially the various Grand and Park Hyatts.

Hilton has the 'Conrad' hotels which are typically very, very nice.

Fairmont is a niche brand but they probably have the best average hotel, as everything they do is basically luxury."
"Hi, congratulations on your new home! 
A few suggestions, not necessarily evergreen. 
Have you considered pleaching across the back wall? Would require regular pruning/ training to keep growth in check, but would keep an open feel to the garden and give screening from neighbours. The RHS gardens at Wisley have some lovely examples of pleaching.
I love eucalyptus trees in a small garden, but check very carefully for growth rate of your chosen variety! Again, pruning can keep under control. 
A beautiful tree for small gardens is an amelanchier lamarkii, small, stunning at every season, but it is deciduous.

Not a builder so can’t give advice on the wall and roots proximity. 
Whatever you choose, enjoy!"
"Love these picks! Ormonde Jayne Woman and Guerlain Mitsouko narrowly missed my list as well (ditto Un Bois Vanille, actually), and Narcisco Rodriguez is a good old friend too. I've also had my eye on Cap Neroli, but have yet to actually smell it."
"We'll make the quarters then lose a close game to some team who have a better defense.

And that'll be that, we'll look back fondly at the best footballers the country ever had but will never get rid of the lingering ""what if"" , especially the wc semi final.. if we had reached the final I'm sure we would have won the whole thing, Lukaku and Hazard/KDB would've dominated in those circumstances."
It also produced the lady who saved the Afghan Girls' Robotics Team. They produce all sorts.
I played the demo on pc is the phone experience pretty good ? I don’t own an ipad
Me too but that doesn’t really help
"Oh, come on. The [original](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/web03/2010/4/8/0/creepy-pooh-bear-is-creepy-30109-1270700415-0.jpg) is weirder and funnier."
"As someone who regularly gets chest infections toward the end of a cold, I think it’s worthwhile pointing out that antibiotics can eventually be needed. They won’t help bronchitis, but if after a couple of weeks you have a deep chesty cough with green mucous and/or blood, it’s worth getting your dr to check for pneumonia, which is bacterial, and can put people in hospital. Not disagreeing, but I wound up very ill one winter because I didn’t ask my dr!"
Predestination is a really weird one.
"> climate  
  
People from the US northern states would like southern Norway, much milder than the US north.  
  
> cost of living  
  
Must be seen relative to your income in the new place.  
  
> ease of integrating into the culture  
  
Easy in countries with the same or very similar language but countries such as Norway offer you a free 1500 hour language training class as an immigrant to ease the process.  
  
> shopping/conveniences   
 
I have no idea what this means!  
Edit: In Norway you can get up to 400Mbit bi-directional Internet connections and have better cell phone coverage than the US. You can shop until you drop. Other than this, I am not sure what you are on to."
"Bath “sand”.  I tried making homemade bath bombs, but it didn’t work out well, so I ground it down to a sort of sand-like substance.  She’s asked for it two years in a row now, and I suspect this will be the third."
"The Rum is gone?

Why is the Rum gone?"
"I didn't care for it because it's a movie full of meaningless action in a film that didn't feel like that's what it ""should have"" been, if that makes any sense.  I actually liked Kong: Skull Island a lot because it felt like an action film on every level; for Jackson's King Kong, I don't know, I needed more gravitas from almost everyone cast in that movie and I can't say I was satisfied with anyone."
