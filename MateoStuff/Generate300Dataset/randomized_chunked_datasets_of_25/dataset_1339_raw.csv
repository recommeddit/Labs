Just a grab bag of metal with some rock here and there. Mostly clean vocal stuff. Lots of Power Metal. Lots of older bands: Judas Priest, ACCEPT, W.A.S.P., Saxon, etc. 

Shuffle, hit the skip button until something gets you pumped."
Ice brings out the flavours though.
"Made this in France with flowers that are just opening, steeped in milk/cream at a fairly low heat for what seemed to me to be a very short time. Then they squeezed the flowers into the batch and I think this is what really makes the difference."
And that's a famous person's story about MJ... normal people are probably treated far worse.  I know that /r/nba has their fair share of stories regarding MJ and how much of a self centered asshole he is.
"Just got introduced to Reddit cause the new love for tabletop games .... and mate ffs you are a the first one to talk about Magic Maze... you are a god :)
Not sure if can go against forbidden dessert or pademic in terms of coopness but.. if you wanna join coop with party game epic fun game this is the game."

"Kourtney won me over in early years and in especially Miami, and I love the boundaries she sets now. She is also very interesting to look at-some might say the most."
">I know what 'systemd' is and wish to avoid that.

"Ferret owner here! I love my four little noodles so much, but they are not an ideal pet for inexperienced pet owners or young children. They require a lot of time, attention, and cleaning. They can and will nip/bite. They also have a lot of health issues which can be costly to treat.

Out of my four current ferrets there is only one that we can trust with our daughter. And even then we would never allow him to be around her unsupervised."
"My husband and I go extravagant for my mom every year. We got her an expensive watch that years later, she still talks about. We got her a new iPad last year and she loves that she could replace her old one. She is our world, so we treat her as such."
Hawaii.
"As a stem major I definitely can’t have as much fun as my business major friends, but if you are organized and plan ahead a little bit, there’s time in most weeks to go out or even just hang out with friends and have a good time"
Very long time. The 6s is almost 5 years old I guess and is going to support iOS 14
"In what world does vodka not give bad hangovers, and can I live there?"
Would Swiss Army Man be an adventure?
"History of the entire world, I guess."
"My advice to use to get a pressure cooker.  

The entirety of the process still takes 15 minutes but the eggs come out perfect every time and very easily peelable.

My guess is the pressure itself pushes the meat of the egg away from the shell.

Edit: looks like others agree"
"twas my first :p loved it too

didnt quite like that it just kind of threw information at you, and didnt explain it right away. like it expected you to know what they were talking about."
My dad has a subscription to the WSJ that I read whenever he hasn't thrown it out. I sometimes pick up my city's paper. I also enjoy a plethora of magazine subscriptions :).
"Thanks yesthis11. Your post makes so much sense. Of course I would obviously spend time with it to train and exercise, but maybe I am not quite ready yet. I am just trying to learn more and more. I absolutely hate people who get a pet/dog and keep it locked up in a cage or secluded in a room or outside on a leash. I think its cruel! If I do get a dog one day, it would be a real family member that I would keep by me all the time when I am home etc... that being said though, not sure if I am ready for that lifestyle change just yet.. I have always wanted a dog, but my current lifestyle doesn't make it a very easy option to consider at this point..."
"You're safe to start with something generic. Then one day after living there for a few months or a year, once you get to know the patterns of sunlight and shadow in the rooms, you may suddenly realize you need a dark blue kitchen, robin's egg/lavender bedroom and spicy office. Well, that's [what I chose](https://imgur.com/a/PJitufE). Or maybe you'll stay with fashionable grey or that warm sandy tone that makes pasty skin white look great. I had that on the other office walls. I agree with other people that if you don't have very strong feelings about colours, as I do, then neutral and then changing the accents when you feel like it are a great way to go."
"Ooh those looks pretty damn delicious, thank you."
I would reccomend Blue Mountain State if you are into American Pie type comedy
