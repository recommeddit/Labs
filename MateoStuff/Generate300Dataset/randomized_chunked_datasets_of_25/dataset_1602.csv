5196,"Story time... Once bought a kitchen light fixture from Lowes. Got it mostly installed only to find out the plastic cover they'd included in the box was the wrong part to fit the end brackets. Took all the parts I had left that weren't screwed to the ceiling, and the box and receipt, up to the store and asked them if they could swap that part for the right one.

And the answer was no. They said I had to go home, take down the whole fixture, fit it back into the box, and exchange it.

After raising enough of a commotion I finally got one of the CS reps to agree to let me go swap the parts from another box, but that advice ""wasn't on behalf of Lowes"" (he actually took off his apron to make the point) and they'd disavow any knowledge of it if anybody asked.

In contrast, Home Depot has previously just let me return the one incorrect piece for the whole refund if I'd wanted to (I actually had to argue that I just wanted an exchange, thanks).

You'd think I'd eventually learn to make sure all the pieces are present before I start, but no, that would be too easy...",best home improvement store
