"actually, I went to clarkson and they actually made us learn linux first semester first class in the c++ course. plus linux is made for coding, so, that senior knew exactly what he was talking about most likely =P"

As opposed to what? Every year they recommend the iPhone as their top choice.

I was pretty disappointed in Magic Mountain as a park. Great coasters, trashy park."

"Laksa or something with eggs & bacon if I can't be bothered.

"The dpi was an accident. I have two dpi adjustment buttons on my Razer Naga mouse, and had accidentally turned it all the way to maximum (8200 dpi) and just got used to it for a period of years. I didn't realize that was fast until I was talking to a friend about a new mouse/mousepad last week, which was when I cut it back to 4400 - less feels very sluggish to me for the moment. I'm going to try to move myself down to a more realistic setting, which hopefully the added control from a good pad will help with. Fun fact since I'm talking about it, my total range of motion with my mouse was about half an inch to cross both monitors.

 I play mostly stuff like Path of Exile, Hades, and some League. Shooters I always swap to controller for, bad habit from my xbox days. Also probably because it's very difficult to have stable aim on 8200 dpi. 

I think based off what you've said I'll go for the soft and see how that plays out."
2012 is often used as a cut off because then it's clear people are talking about Pep Guardiola's Barca.  You are right though.

But I swear I can stop any time I want.
"You can try some classic sword and sorcery (like Conan). I recommend Elric, Corum, Hawkmoon and Erekose by Michael Moorcock, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser by Fritz Leiber, Kane by Karl Edward Wagner. I have not yet read some of those, but I intend to and most people seem to like them.
I haven't read any, but propably Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms books also match what you want."

"I did not know this. I fly a 1970s Cessna while wearing polarized sunglasses, and I've never noticed any issues. I'm guessing the older instruments don't have polarized glass."

Philly honestly reminds me of the NYC of my youth which I think is a huge part of why I love it. I would move to Philly tomorrow if I could. <3
"Yeah like what the other said - winter is laughable to the rest of Canada, virtually non existent with average of 0c to -5c, hardly snows. Summer is typically 23-28c. This is one of the reason why Vancouver is consistently ranked in top 5 of the best livable city in the world."
