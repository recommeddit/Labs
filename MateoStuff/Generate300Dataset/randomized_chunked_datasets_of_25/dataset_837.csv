44472,"A downside to this I found was being too accustomed to it. When I had blackout curtains for a few years, I'd only be able to fall asleep in (near) pitch darkness, and exacerbated my insomnia if any other little thing was wrong.

Travelling? Multi-site camping? Crashing at a friend's or someone's place? All became completely sleepless nights. 

Naturally, this depends how much light your room gets and how often you might have to sleep anywhere else. Sleep masks work well, unless you're the sort to take them off in your sleep.

-------

Edit (after the first two sleep mask recommendations): I used eye/sleep masks as a transition period, but found it better to train myself to get used to sleeping with a bit of light. This was a bigger issue in my 20s when I'd often stay at a buddy's place or at a hook-up on a whim. I did get better curtains, but actively refrained from blackout curtains for that reason.",best items under $100
