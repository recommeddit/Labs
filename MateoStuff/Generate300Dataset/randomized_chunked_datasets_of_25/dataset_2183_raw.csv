"Great, thank you! Btw, did you get the Symmetry + Mag Safe case? Or was it just the regular Symmetry case?"
[[TouchFlow]] works same with the cc module tweak for it
"I knew it was a big sacrifice for the wireless option but as far as wireless standards, I thought the 2.4ghz were the only decent option around..... at the risk of sounding ignorant thought, is the wired option i.e USBC to 3.5mm included a viable option or is the quality dependant on the headset and not connection?

Sounds legit
"Sorry, I didn't see the ""Stop me from being lazy"" extension."
"Jodie Foster.

Worked on her directorial debut way back in 1990, Little Man Tate, as a lowly unpaid art department intern.  Everyone on the crew was unbelievably cool.  Had the pleasure of sitting next to Jodie at lunch a couple of times.  She seemed absolutely without ego - just funny, warm, brilliant and kind.  Easily the most down-to-Earth celebrity I've had the pleasure of working with."
A good bullshit face. Those politicians know when they're lying.
Weird is usb-c is pretty solid
"These are the ones I keep going back to:

Blindsight by Peter Watts

Anathem by Neal Stephenson

Poseidon's Children series by Alastair Reynolds

Spin by Robert Charles Wilson

Neptune's Brood by Charles Stross

Flood/Ark by Stephen Baxter"
"If I really want to get crazy, I'll put on some [Devildriver](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevilDriver) or Lamb of God."
"That doesn't make it an RPG. Just ""RPG elements"" which sadly is all that's required these days :( RPGs need branching paths, dialogue trees, persuasion, multiple ways to solve problems. God of War and Horizon aren't RPGs at all imo."
Damnnn they pricy
"Well, more like multiple niches, yes, longer cables, angled plugs, flat cables, USB C cables that screw in place... whatever a professional setting requires."
Greatest show ever. I will fight to the death defending it.
"I loved the plot twist in The Prestige so much, I saw it in theaters three times. Any time I see it on TV I need to watch it, and it is easily one of my top 10 favorite movies. WAY better than the illusionist, IMO."
Rhodes. Sounds amazing in any song.
"I think a gerbil would be a good fit. They're nicer than hamsters in my experience, and they're smaller and thus less work than a rat. Just know that they don't do well in those small plastic cages you get at the petstore. Just pick up a good sized aquarium tank and put the bedding right in there. If you have questions feel free to pm me."
Barry is love. Barry is life.
Don't bend them and only grab the plug when you pull them out of a socket. Don't press the plug against your body when you lie on the couch with the phone plugged in.
"> Which meant a lot of time doing nothing, then a few nights locked in the lab to get the code compiled & submitted by 11:59:59

This is the most apt description of a CS student's life I've ever read, especially the part about submitting by 11:59:59."
Silent Witness is a great British series. Worth checking out if you can get it.
"I didn't partake in anywhere near the full amount you can do and I finished it in 169 hours. Very stylish game, and it's great to play something so character focused and have those characters be so good."
"I got a set of the 30ml perfume, lotion and shower gel for 30 dollars. For context, I live in Kenya."
"And really, has vision ever been anything other than a burden to you? :)"
Poor Eeyore :(
