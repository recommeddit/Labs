73757,best matte screen protector for ipad,"They’re not difficult to remove at all. You just use your fingernails and pick them up from the end.

You won’t be able to use them again though. Once you get a bit of dust sticking to it, you’ll never get them off. Maybe if you’re in a completely dust-free environment you might be able to keep them for later, but I highly doubt it."

44794,best items under $100,A Kuhn Rikon can opener that pops open the can from the side. Much better than the top slicing models that make contact with the food. I had an old Swing-A-Way Made in USA can opener that finally died after 22 years of use. Switched to a European brand after finding out the new Swing-A-Ways were Made in China and have quality issues.

24062,best anime,"Yeah definetly watch Madoka Magica knowing as little as possible. I didn't know the plot, but I went in knowing what to expect and honestly it was incredibly disappointing after hearing all the hype surrounding it."
9969,best portable charger,I have an anker one as well. I get  3-4 charges out of it.  The battery stays charged up so I can pull it out of a drawer after a month of not touching it and it's still fully charged. I'm very pleased with it.

44713,best items under $100,"*  Menstrual cup - has probably saved me $100s at this point
* Safety Razor - I can't believe I used to spend $25 on 6 Venus blades that would last like a week when a 100 pack of these blades are better and $5. 
* Heavy duty reusable grocery bags - No need to worry about carrying too much crap and ripping plastic/paper bags, never get charged 5c for bags again
* CBD oil - I have annoying sinus pain now and then, this stuff helps for the times that advil doesn't. Was also great when I pulled a muscle in my back a few wks ago.
* Spotify subscription - So cheap for how much I use it. I know it's not an object but it replaces all the CDs I used to have to buy in the olde times
* Metal pilot pen that fits their refills - These pen refills are magic, I take notes for work every day and send letters to people and this current refill has somehow been going for a year? Basically a never ending pen."

11385,best gifts for dad,"If you really want to get him a meaningful gift, this thread won't help. The best gift you can possibly get someone is going to be unique to that person. My recommendation is to think hard about what he does in his free time and try to shop in that category. For example my dad (before passing away) knew more about computers than me, which is very rare for a parent, so I might have gotten him something having to do with older computers that would give him a feeling of nostalgia."
