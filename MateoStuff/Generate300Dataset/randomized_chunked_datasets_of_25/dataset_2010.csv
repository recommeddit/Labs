25544,best cricket teams of all time,"> 7) Gilchrist - Only rival would be if Sanga was WK. Boucher and a few others could challenge as keeper alone, but no one else for WK/batting combo

Not even AB de Villiers? Sure, he doesn't have as high a strike-rate as Gilchrist, but I'm sure he could bat that quickly if necessary."

30147,best Mexican war to study,"The U.S Army was definitely well prepared for the war - it was woefully unprepared for the War of 1812 and suffered greatly as a result for the first two years of the war, but came out of it as a highly effective and professional force, and went into Mexico as one thirty years later."

9277,best toothpaste,"Dental nightmare here. I've been seeing my dentist every few weeks since I finally grew the balls to step up and get my shit fixed. 

We've gone over this quite a bit, because there are these wild toothpastes all over the world that are expensive and make crazy claims. (Especially in Japan, like holy shit, you can get a $300 tube of toothpaste that claims it rebuilds your teeth over there.) 

His answer is always, ""does it have flouride? Good. That's the one."" 

It can be one from Dollar Tree or some expensive one that promises to whiten your teeth in x amount of weeks. (It probably won't, and might have abrasive stuff in it that will do more harm than good.)

Also, worth noting, be extremely careful with foreign toothpastes. Most are pretty good, but some can have some really unsavory stuff in them. Imagine my surprise when I read a study done on a few brands of Indian toothpaste, and one I had used before, Colgate Herbal, was found to contain fucking nicotine. 

If anyone has any questions about general dentistry stuff and the mistakes you can make as a patient, i'll happily try and answer, and i'm sure my dentist would be receptive, too."

Republicans would rather have a gay or muslim president than an atheist one, which is saying a lot."
