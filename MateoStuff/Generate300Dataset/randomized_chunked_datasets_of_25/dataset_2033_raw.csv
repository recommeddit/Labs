"Happy Reading, can't wait to see what you think when you read them."
My dentist who is awesome and recognized in his field doesn't use any tooth paste.  He just flosses and uses mouthwash
mind explaining a bit more about why? Really trying to learn here
"Lmao at the doves. 

We have bunnies around here too, though somewhat rare I will see them a few times a year. 

We had to live and let live with some wasps two years ago because we discovered the hive too late (would have been dangerous to tangle with it, where it was built). Luckily wasps all did in the winter so removed it around November.

Whether or not you have a gecko pet it sounds like you are rich in wildlife at least :D"

Excellent choices
"I use sensitivity toothpaste and I can tell a huge difference in the sensitivity of them when I use it versus when I use cheap regular shit like Aim. My orthodontist even recommended it to me so there has to be some truth in that, right?!"
"Yep. They're cheap as hell, too with CA incentives. I've been really tempted by an e-Golf with the physical gauges. It's just a shame that there isn't a fun one yet."
Probably piano. It's one of few I can think of that doesn't require skill to not sound bad playing a single note. Not to take away from it of course - its lack of expression makes great piano music even more impressive. But most other instruments you can expect to sound pretty terrible for a considerable period of time.
"I'm going to suggest my personal favorite city of Orlando, Florida. There are plenty of flights between England and Orlando. I'd just suggest staying away from International Drive as you'll find it full of British tourists so probably not too interesting for you. If you go downtown though you'll will probably have a great time. If you're a big NFL fan, you can drive a couple hours north to Jacksonville and see a Jaguars game (they're doing excellent this year and they're lead by Orlando area native Blake Bortles) for ice hockey, you could watch Orlando's own Solar Bears play at the Amway Center in downtown Orlando. The only downside from your point of view is that Orlando never really gets cold (maybe 40s (Fahrenheit) at the coldest) but as someone who lives in a cold state I'd call that a huge positive TBH."
"This sub sure swings heavy, huh?

Also, yay spirit Island, suck it JOTL."
Five dozen eggs.
"Fair enough, and what are you expertise in this area/which one is the better one?"
The Good Place was really good!
"Every special by each of these men is fantastic: John Mulaney, Bill Burr, Tom Segura, & Dave Chapelle.

Also, not necessarily a stand up, but Seinfeld‚Äôs ‚ÄúComedians in Cars Getting Coffee‚Äù also has some great humor as well!!!"
"Old fashioned, but I like Melissa Nathan, especially 'Persuading Annie'. I really dig Ilona Andrews (read every book)  and recently discovered Racheline Maltese and read her 'A Queen from the North', an alternate history take on Royal romance.

Beverly Jenkins writes historical romance with woc. I love her strong heroines."
"Most of the higher tier Ghiblies will probably make it. Wouldn't be surprised to see literally every Miyazaki. Every Kon film for sure with Perfect Blue very close to the top. What I'm really hoping to see is Mind Game and Patlabor 2 perform well. I see overwhelming critical praise for the latter in particular (and Satoshi Kon himself praised the former!) so I'm optimistic. Also interested to see how Yamada does given that she's newer. Liz probably won't make it because it came out in 2018 even though it deserves to, but everything else has a decent shot imo."

this depends. I live in the bay and today paid $2.30 for gas. don't buy milk often so can't compare.
"I was up late the night before and we left early to get down there.  I didn't want to sleep on the way down so I threw back one of these.  Nobody told me to shoot half of it now, and then half later."
ranger for sure
"Just join your local library. If you are banned/ have a ton of overdues at your local, join some other library online. It's free. Also, if they don't have a book that you want, you can still generally request it, particularly during COVID-19, they are more likely to get a copy I would think. If you need any help just ask!

Where would we be without you?
Interesting ü§î I've never had to log into multiple zoom accounts to get this done. Have you encountered problems before?
That's why I said *ability* to become a neurosurgeon.
