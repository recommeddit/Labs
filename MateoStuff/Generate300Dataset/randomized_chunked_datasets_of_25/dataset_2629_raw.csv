"I think the overall show is poor. The writing is the most jarring element.

David Cross is a good but not great comedian. His best role as an actor was Tobias in Arrested Development, which was written for him.

Shaun Pye who co-writes with him (you might know him as the insufferable 'Greg' from Extras) is also not in the elite bracket of comedy writers. He had written for TV before, but I think mainly panel shows (Buzzcocks etc.).

TV comedy writing is about three things: an emotional anchor for the audience (someone relatable we can root for), a lens through which we see the absurd (it could be through the eyes of the everyman, or it could be something else), and jokes about the absurd.

Simplest example in modernity is The Office. Tim is the everyman we root for. He is also the lens through which we see the absurd: Gareth, David, et al. The Office's jokes aren't scripted and delivered with split-second timing a la Seinfeld; they're just David or Gareth being David or Gareth, and then Tim reacts.

Seinfeld is a good example. We can all relate to Jerry, and we root for George. The absurd is whatever Seinfeld chooses to pick apart: condiments, low fat yoghurt, the mail. And the jokes are overt, scripted, honed to perfection, and we get them rapidly.

If you watch TIDOTM it just doesn't feel professionally made. The pacing and editing is poor, and the actors aren't protected by good writing. There's no heart to it. It's got shades of the absurd (why would this man ever be trusted to go and do this job? Why would he surround himself with these people?), but unlike e.g. The Mighty Boosh, it doesn't embrace that wholly and seems to try to place itself somewhere between a traditional sitcom, mockumentary and surrealism. It just doesn't work as a concept.

Finally there's the title. It just about makes sense, but 'increasingly poor' is clumsy, and 'The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret' falls into a category of quasi-Goth absurdist humour that to me is as jarring as those 'accessible' post-rock bands which cropped up in the early 2000s and had brackets in their song names like ""Jeffrey watches the world burn (around him, a songbird sings)"". Like ""Rhod Gilbert and the Cat That Looks like Nicholas Lyndhurst"" or ""Greg Davies: Firing Cheeseballs at a Dog"".

I watched the whole thing because I like David Cross and have a sort of morbid fascination with Shaun Pye (insofar as I've never seen anyone with a face so perfectly smug), but it's just *bad*."

"Trinidad & Tobago:

We vary based on race, money and day. 

We have street food that could be bought before heading to work called **doubles**. They are two fried channa (chickpeas) pieces of dough folded with chickpeas/curry/tamarind sauce/cucumber. People line up bright and early to buy some and it's also sold at night, only time you might not find it is betwn 1pm-7pm or so. 

**Sada Roti/Pholurie/Paratha** can be eaten in the morning with pumpkin (mashed), tomoto choka (ummm, grilled tomatoes seasoned) or bodi or with butter. Sada roti is served with condensed milk, but it's more of a treat sometimes and may not be eated before school. This is cooked in Indian households, people of African decent would have pholurie/paratha for lunch or dinner. 

**Fruits** of all sorts! I don't remember any house that I went to that didn't have a fruit tree of some sort in the yard. There is usually a basket of SOMETHING at my aunt's house. Oranges, pomerac, bananas, paw paw, cherries, mangoes. And then imported apples, plums, pears and things of that nature. 

**Fry Bake or Roast Bake** Fry bake is not baked, but fried and we say fry, not fried. It's essentially dough that is made into little balls, flattened and fried until they puff up and is soft and golden and delicious. It's eaten with eggs and sausage (hot dogs) or with saltfish (bacalao/codfish), smoked herring, butter/cheese. Roast bake is the same dough, it may have coconut flakes in the dough and it's put in a cast iron and placed in the oven or a gas stove with something covering it. Eaten with the same as the fry bake, but also with pumpkin (mashed). 

**Tea** is anything hot and may include, coffee-tea, coco-tea (hot cocoa), horlicks, ovaltine, nesquik or just plain ol tea. Something or anything is dunked in this. Also in ""cocoa tea"" crackers are mixed in. I never did it, but kids love it. 

**Crix**, the vital supply!!, simple circle cracker, a little heavier than a saltine that now comes in many different flavors and is eaten with cheese, butter, peanut butter, jam (pineapple, guava), eggs, sausage (hot dogs) or vienna sausages (fried with onions, ketcher and peppers). 

Then the usual cereal, milk, eggs, toast, bacon. Maybe yogurt now as it's been introduced to country on a cheaper scale."

"Yeah it's a big hole in the switch marketplace. Not without reason: no analog triggers, sim racing games are often quite demanding since they all try to be gorgeous, etc.

Gear Club Unlimited exists, but it's very simple and probably not worth your time honestly.

So uh... I mean XCloud sure is coming along well if you've got the network reliability for it lmao (either way you can test Game Pass Ultimate for a month for $1, so it's not exactly a huge investment to test). That has dang near every sim racing game on the market that isn't exclusive to another platform. 

Unfortunate that I gotta recommend a whole other platform to ya, but yeah it's a real big hole in the Switch library."

"of course it DOES NOT however, in natural software nature, every year there’s a new iOS version which ideally have more features than previous year’s.

The more features the system has, the more it consumes processing power.

And to add to this, their QA prioritize (i think) newer iPhone models than older models so if your old iPhone happens to be slow due to newer iOS, it’s just that it is fixable but QA and engineers don’t have that luxury time to fix for small shares of users.

I have both 6s and SE 2020, 6s on iOS 13 is still freakin extremely fast in terms of gestures and fluidity. But i cannot the say the same for my 2014 MBP 13inch on macOS Big Sur. The performance between Catalina ang Big Sur is day and night."
">The sinner

The rest of the list is not in any kind of order, but I'd say that if you liked Manhunt as a proper detective, you definitely need to watch Broadchurch, The Killing (the original series is danish, but american version is amazing as well), Broen is a swedish/danish detective with amazing plot twists, and I'd also add Deadwind, it's a rather exotic one, because it's from Finland. Hope you like it. :)"
