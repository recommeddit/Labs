23100,"About twenty years ago, when ""I'm Just a Girl"" first started getting radio play, I did something I had never bothered to do: I went to go see the band, of which I knew nothing. Having just gotten off of work, and looking like absolute crap-- glasses, blazer over wrinkled pants, unkempt hair-- I arrived early at the venue and realized I had no idea where to find the actual ticket office. I stood outside the place; there was no one around, and no sign of the coming show except for the band's tour bus. I pondered this for a bit, then a pretty platinum blonde happened by. I stopped her and asked if she had any idea where the ticket office was. She blinked, tilted her head, and then said, ""I don't know either. Let's go find out!""

She led me into the venue, through a small group of puzzled-looking dudes tuning their instruments, then had me stand around for a moment while she ducked into some deeper chamber to go ask various people about the when and where of ticket-purchase for this particular show.

She returned shortly with the required information, then smoothly led me out.

I still had no idea who she was until I came back for the show a few hours later, and Gwen Stefani was, of course, leading the band.",best celebrity

37026,"Cedar Point is literally the worst example for theming. Their ""theming"" is pretty much just the lake setting. None of the rides have themes except maybe for Maverick, but they have done a terrible job keeping the theme up and now it's basically nonexistent. I love CP but that's ridiculous to say they have good theming compared to a place like BGW.",best roller coaster at six flags
