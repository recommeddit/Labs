23100,best celebrity,"About twenty years ago, when ""I'm Just a Girl"" first started getting radio play, I did something I had never bothered to do: I went to go see the band, of which I knew nothing. Having just gotten off of work, and looking like absolute crap-- glasses, blazer over wrinkled pants, unkempt hair-- I arrived early at the venue and realized I had no idea where to find the actual ticket office. I stood outside the place; there was no one around, and no sign of the coming show except for the band's tour bus. I pondered this for a bit, then a pretty platinum blonde happened by. I stopped her and asked if she had any idea where the ticket office was. She blinked, tilted her head, and then said, ""I don't know either. Let's go find out!""

She led me into the venue, through a small group of puzzled-looking dudes tuning their instruments, then had me stand around for a moment while she ducked into some deeper chamber to go ask various people about the when and where of ticket-purchase for this particular show.

She returned shortly with the required information, then smoothly led me out.

I still had no idea who she was until I came back for the show a few hours later, and Gwen Stefani was, of course, leading the band."

37026,best roller coaster at six flags,"Cedar Point is literally the worst example for theming. Their ""theming"" is pretty much just the lake setting. None of the rides have themes except maybe for Maverick, but they have done a terrible job keeping the theme up and now it's basically nonexistent. I love CP but that's ridiculous to say they have good theming compared to a place like BGW."

11093,best backpack for college,"I'm still using my Jansport pack after 15 years. Got it in middle school, and after giving up on college it became my outdoors pack. I tore off the logo a long time ago and picked up a stain from somewhere, but the rest of the pack is pretty much perfect. It's become my every day carry bag for the last year.

You can use 'em for more than just school, ya know."

I have a benq xl2430t and I am very satisfied with it, but it really needs some cleaning now and I am afraid of doing something wrong and damaging the monitor."
8743,best toothpaste,"Absolutely. I use a rinse at night after I brush called Biotine it leaves a little bit of a residue in your mouth but it's not unpleasant, just takes a little to get used to. The mouth guard keeps you from grinding, also keeps your teeth and gums moist. Definitely notice the difference in the morning, now it's just routine."
22882,best celebrity,"Lady Gaga.
I sat down with her and had someone take a picture of us. I complimented her on her show but I was overall super nervous and flustered. I quickly got up to walk away but she grabbed me, told me to sit down, and demanded we talk some more and take a few more pictures. It was glorious."
