It's fucking garbage. Stay far away from it. Cannot recommend this case for anyone.

Leather feels super cheap. The volume buttons are super difficult to press. The force required is absurd. The plastic has clear, sharp molding lines that makes it uncomfortable to hold. The leather edge is so sharp that my pinky hurts after 10 minutes of holding my phone one-handed."

56211,best action and adventure movie,"Yeah, it ends in disillusion and tragedy, so it doesn't have that upbeat connotation that I certainly have with the term ""adventure"". It IS an adventure in the sense that it explores what was (for most of its audience at the time) an unseen corner of the world, but than, it was the age of Cinerama, and the film is almost a semi-travelogue.

As for action, I disagree with Lean that action somehow ""cheapens"" a movie. But I do still like the movie a lot, so. Bridge on the River Kwai is probably closer to being an action film."
