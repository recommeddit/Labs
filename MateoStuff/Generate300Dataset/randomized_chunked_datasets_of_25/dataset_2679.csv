65184,best phone service company,Verizon flawless-att ridiculously expensive in comparison. Verizon customer service is better too.
13839,best research paper archive,"I really like Rodney Brooks' 1999 paper [Intelligence Without Representation](http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/representation.pdf), one of the few papers I remember from when I was studying artificial intelligence. The paper argues against a dominant trend in AI at the time and for a radically different approach. His central rhetorical device --- comparing artificial intelligence to the study of artificial flight --- is an idea that has stuck with me ever since I read it."

517,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"I'm having the same issue. The stylus works really well with the art software included, but it's not possible to open or import .pdf files in this software. Using the stylus with Mac preview seems laggy. I have an old version of Adobe Acrobat Professional, but it crashes whenever I try to change the pencil colour from red. The free Adobe program seems to just do signatures, not general markup. I just downloaded a trial of PDF Expert and it seems to work well."

22791,best celebrity,"I have to vouch for The Rock.  I met him at a Wal-Mart when I was 11.  I saw him in the home and garden section, I said something dumb like ""Whoa The Rock!"" he was dressed in one of those $500 dollar shirts with fancy glasses and turned, took the glasses off raised his eyebrow and said ""What are you looking at jabroni?"" then started laughing and shook my hand.

Still not sure what he was doing looking at fertilizer in the middle of Kansas though"
