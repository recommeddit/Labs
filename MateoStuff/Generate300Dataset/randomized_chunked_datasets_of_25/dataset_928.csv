33955,"I'd suggest either Ultrasun/Ultramoon OR Heartgold/Soulsilver.

I'll be honest that I'd learn towards the last two I mentioned though. They generally encompass everything good about the games. Sun/Moon and the Ultra versions are good and the most polished ones, but it's story-heavy (lots of cutscenes, even though in Ultra the beginning is much faster) and the story is not even that good. Although, in that case, I'd definitely suggest to go for the Ultra versions. More content, more Pokemon, in general it's better. You don't need to play the original Sun and Moon to play it.

And for the last question: no, there's no reason to play the other version. Unless you want to complete the Pokedex, but in case of the latest games, there's always the online trades for that (online play is not available anymore in Heartgold and Soulsilver).

Another good one is Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. That ones had loads of legendaries you can catch in the post-game, but that could be my nostalgia blinding me since Sapphire was my first game, so naturally I loved the remake :p",best Pokemon game

63192,"I mainly use zebra 75% of the time but on occasion it has issues with some repos or packages mainly because of the way it handles dependencies differently than Cydia. I love cydia, never have any problems and is my go to should I encounter any issues with other package managers. It is a little slow to launch/load to get into the app which is one of the main issues I have with it. I really like installer and am still tryna acclimate to the odd organization of it. Iâ€™d like to be able to use the queue without having to wait for all my repos to update, itâ€™s inconvenient if you simply want to remove something. I also use saily which is pretty cool, it reminds me of rock (rock your iPhone) if it had a baby with sileo. It has a lot of potential but a few things arenâ€™t in English, like the news source but you could make your own as they give you the info to do so. Would like someone to port the zebra or installer news sources to saily. I donâ€™t fck with anything coolstar creates. I have used sileo but my experience with it was awful. 
All that said, anyone know if Lime is still in development?
Iâ€™m staying on 12.2 because the whole point in jailbreaking for me is to use my device however I see fit and iOS 13 isnâ€™t feature rich enough to compensate for the lack of tweak compatibility and I depend on many unsupported tweaks that will not be updated. I absolutely love unc0ver but on occasion I will use checkra1n. Checkra1n definitely runs more like stock but I donâ€™t have any issues with any of the 335 packages I have installed using either unc0ver or checkra1n.
Iâ€™ve been tweaking my setup a lot and as is with everything enabled my scores in Geekbench are higher than a stock iPhone X. I plan on making different setups via flashback for aesthetics and for performance but I havenâ€™t gotten around to it just yet.",best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit

Personally, my favourite light scents are Frederic Malle L'eau d'Hiver (as the name suggests, like a first snow), Prada Infusion d'Iris (powdery iris), Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt (although this one isn't really that light on me), and Annick Goutal Mandragore (almost a spicy, green citrus; rather hard to describe). I like the Hermes Jardin line very much as well - they're fairly light and aquatic/green, like if Monet's watercolours were rendered into perfume form.",best perfume
