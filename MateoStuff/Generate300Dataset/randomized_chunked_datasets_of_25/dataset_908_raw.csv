"Honestly there is nothing wrong with spending lots of money starting out if it's something you're really into, as long as you're having fun enjoying yourself you should just do what you enjoy. Sometimes having nicer equipment and webcam can help bring yourself confidence and motivate you to create higher quality, I know when I started off with fitness/going to the gym, I spent a lump sum of money on supliments like bcas creatine and protein, as well as getting myself some nice gym clothes to workout in, and it help give me some confidence and motivate me to continue to go, I'd assume the same would go for streaming."
"I think this is why rankings suck lmao. Itâ€™s so subjective, I think the fact that Iâ€™m from the northeast makes me see northeastern as much better than Purdue, because frankly I never heard of that school before this sub."
soap and water. soap and water.
"They did but the rules were quiet a bit different. 

They had spots for punters, kickers, and returners. Also, only a little bit of the voting was leaked so it's mostly here's 100 players with very little information on who is 1 or 100."

Banana Clipper and Job Well Done. Those should've made the list if we're going to discuss Run The Jewels.

Fully agree. I think his books are dreadfully written. The Dune books he co-authored completely ignore the character motivations established by Frank Herbert and are ludicrous.
"I'd also argue that the United team from 2006-2011 was better as they reached 3 champions league finals winning one of them and also won 4 out of 5 Premier League titles. The like of prime Rooney, Ronaldo, Tevez, Carrick Scholes, Vidic, Ferdinand and van der Sar were the core of the team!

Great article though!"

"They aren't great literature full of clever characterisation or subtle themes, but you're *never* going to get that when your primary requirement is ""action packed"".

As action novels go they're not bad - the world-building isn't as good as Peter F. Hamilton or Iain Banks, but they're enjoyable enough, and (*unlike* later Banks) his books at least have a coherent plot and narrative which proceeds from a beginning through a middle to an end."

"11 Pro Max Otter Box Symmetry case. And if they have them out in November, the Star Wars edition cases. Last years Xs Max symmetry Star Wars cases were awesome.

Edit: replaced commuter with symmetry. Symmetry is the one piece case. And itâ€™s the Symmetry Galactic collection that features a Star Wars decal on the back."
Better ILPT just fuckin visit /r/piracy and look at the megathread.
Thanks for the suggestion but Woodstockâ€™s is hands down the worst pizza Iâ€™ve ever had and actually inspired me to make this post after eating a fluffy slice of the bread that they call crust.
why would you recommend against santa rosa? I was actually considering that because I thought the Wellness LLC seemed interesting and practical. Any advice on that?
I asked a travel agent last week to make some suggestions given my budget and a few ideas of locations.  She asked me to let me know what hotels I wanted to stay in and any attractions we wanted to do. She was no fucking help.
"Elements of Statistical Learning.  It's basically ISL but all of the theory involved.  You might also want to check out Computer Age Statistical Inference.  It's also very focused on the math, but more on computational statistics methods."

"Buy a cared-for iPhone SE2 128GB with two Smartish cases (AppleCare expires May 2022) like mine! :P

I'm not sure that the battery life of the 12 mini is better than the SE2, but if you want 5G for the future, 12 or better is a no-brainer."
As a Canadian it is really upsetting to hear about all the things that can supposedly be had for $100 in other places.
SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SHERMAN WILLIAMS!
