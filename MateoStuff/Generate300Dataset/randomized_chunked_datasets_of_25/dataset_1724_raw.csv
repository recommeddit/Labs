"Loved that park. 

Me, wife, son and daughter, 10 and 9 years old then, While standing in the tunnel at the glass looking into the Hippo enclosure, a huge hippo floated up with its ass against the glass and let its bowels lose. It was shooting onto the glass for ever. Like 3 bales of green hay being shot at you. Good memories."

"If you really want chalk, get Vicco from India. It’s an herbal one and actually contains real chalk. I have several towels with permanent stains from wiping my mouth after brushing with it."
Do you have a link to the knife itself or somewhere I can buy it? That sounds like a steal and something I'll use.

"The TI-84 CE is a Godsend, at least for me. The best calculator I've ever owned. I'd  come undone if anything ever happened to it."

"Are the books actually good though? Like, clearly and entertainingly written? I read the short story ""Watchcrab"" by him online, and it was absolute dreck. It made me really hesitant to pick up anything else he's done."
My favorite movie of all time
"Just because something is used doesn't mean it's thriving. 

How are you equating that ""being used"" is the same as being alive? At my last job we used Zend framework 1.x despite the last update being in like 2012. Just because it's functioning doesn't make Zend 1.x alive and well haha. 

Nobody is saying that being dead makes the tool suddenly unusable. It just means ***as a project***, Axios appears to be dead/dying. I have to imagine a lot of people use it because they're like me. They had no idea there were so many concerning issues with the project. I had no idea until I saw this post."

"I feel like this is the minority opinion regarding San cat... Portola is alright. Nothing fantastic, nothing terrible. Just lower your expectations and you'll be fine.

Regardless it is a major inconvenience forcing either to rely on the bus system or to bike some ways away to get on campus. It makes anything other than class harder to attend because you wonder if it's worth the bike ride/hassle. Though Just my thoughts mixed in with what I've heard. I personally live in Santa Cruz and it's pretty awesome that we're in walking distance to the beach."
