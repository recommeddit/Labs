"What's the point of this? The TSA is just going to cut it before anyone else even gets near your bag. Or is this to know whether or not the TSA went through your bag? In my experience the TSA always puts a card telling you they searched your bag, and even if they don't it's pretty safe to assume that yeah they did."
"Jurassic Park III, in the way that I was expecting one and there wasn't any."
"I have the 29” version, and it’s quite nice as well."
"I waited on James Taylor once in New Preston, CT, he's nicer than his songs. I didn't ask for an autograph, but I did tell him my dad was a big fan. Before he left, he came into the kitchen and handed me a note; ""Dear dad, carry on, love, James Taylor"""
"Manjaro is not good for beginners... It is a good distro, great in fact, but not the best for new users...

There is no ""best"" distro, but I would highly recommend one with a more stable release schedule, better stability, and ""simpler"" to understand for new users I would recommend Linux Mint or PopOS, followed by Ubuntu or any of it's variants and spins."
"While that is literally true, there are certain conventions that tend to be associated with ""JRPG"".  These days, I don't even feel that a game necessarily needs to be made in Japan to be a JRPG.  Child of Light or Citizens of Earth jump out to me as being very ""JRPG"" style games that were made outside of Japan.  

If you want to argue purely semantics, you are basically playing a role in every game.  Which obviously nobody is seriously arguing, despite that being the literal meaning of the label RPG."
"[This one is all of my top 5.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fsDsy3ZNKo) But then again, I only ever watch cat videos."
"It's mentioned, but not dwelled on much.  It comes up in High School US history classes, but it's not a major topic, at least in Kentucky.

It's taught as two things:

1. A squabble with Mexico over borders and territory that helped expand the US westward.

2. A precursor to the US Civil War, as many of the major leaders of the Civil War were veterans of the Mexican War and first saw combat there."
Whether or not it was a twist wil confuddle me for many tim
Definitely check out Alyssa Cole
Wouldn't it be more comfortable for you and cheaper for your employer to just rent a small apartment?
Not so much the first one or the one with Jeremy Renner but the middle 2 are absolutely action packed from start to finish
"Oh hmm. Being John Malkovich... That's an amazing movie. Definitely a head trip for the characters. Not sure it's a mind bending movie though. 

Memento, definitely. I originally didn't add it because it's mentioned by OP. I've since added it since people keep suggesting it."
"Pokemon Black/White

Very fast paced, interesting story (certainly not award winning, but still decent), lots of QoL things not in previous games, etc. It still feels great to play to this day. 

A lot of people say HeartGold/Soulsilver, but I personally think they're not that great. They are much more open ended than other games in the series; if that's something you like, maybe you'll like them more than i did."
Google Chrome
"Asymmetric war games generally under performed on that list, and they're pretty much my favorite games.  War of the Ring, Twilight Struggle, Root, etc."
"Not necessarily, unless you know the right place to look or buy from."
"My go-to websites have already been mentioned, here are two more that I haven't used very often, but are fairly useful, in that they have books/articles in foreign languages

"Thanks for your reply. Yeah, I had a coversation about this issue with another shidenkai user, and we came into a conclusion that its my ceramic feet that may have worn out the glass surface. I've ordered now hien soft to try smth different."
"Linux mint should be really beginner friendly if you’re comfortable with windows, Pop_OS is a little more Mac-like although they’ve began to come into their own a bit more in the past few updates. Both are fantastic but I’d push you towards mint if you don’t have any special use cases like an NVIDIA gpu"
There's nothing to say about all that except a big yikes.  I hope you all get through this mess unscathed.
Is poo supposed to look like a wendigo from fallout 76
There are airfreight companies that can deal with airport to airport shipping. It costs heaps of money but I'd imagine that would be an option when travelling with hunting rifles
"The game, starring Michael Douglas
  
Also, the Spanish prisoner. Although I guess that’s just more of a mystery maybe"
i agree.
