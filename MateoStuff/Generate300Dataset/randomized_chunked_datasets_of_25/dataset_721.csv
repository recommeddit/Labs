29178,"I like SiteGround. Their customer service team are very friendly, helpful and - best of all - efficient.
Their basic plan is pretty good to, and can handle around 10,000 visits per month. That’s the kinda traffic I get at the moment. And if my website grows quickly, I can just get an easy upgrade. 
You also get unlimited subdomains and emails, which I think is pretty cool. 
And in the event something goes wrong with your website, I found that they ask for as much information as possible so that they can help you sort it as quickly as they can. If, however, they can’t fix it from the server side, they will instead send you over to someone who can help you. This really pleased me and I’d say that SiteGround is easily one of the best when it comes to customer service. It’s as though they’ve actually invested proper time, care and money into securing the best agents. 
Overall, my experience with SiteGround has been very good and I have no qualms with recommending them to others. That said, for a cheaper option, GreenGeeks is also okay. It’s not as good as SiteGround IMHO, and they don’t seem to be completely open when it comes with how much visits are allowed (they’re also a closed book when it comes to disk space - is it unlimited, is it not?).",best web hosting service

66700,"It's worth keeping in mind with Croatia and Serbia that they often draw their players from their diaspora population as well as their local population. Some examples which spring to mind are Ivan Rakitic and Milos Veljkovic who were born and raised entirely in Switzerland, but due to their parentage, and presumably a strong sense of identity with their parents' homeland, opted to play for Croatia and Serbia respectively. It can be a bit misleading to look simply at the population of the country to determine their potential pool of players, for that reason. Still very impressive for them, either way.",best soccer team in the world
