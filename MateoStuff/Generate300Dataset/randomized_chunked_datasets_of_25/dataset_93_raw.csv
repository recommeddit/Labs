"Indiana Jones, James Bond, The Mummy 1 & 2"
Stewie Griffin...great guy.
"Exactly this. 

Appropriate layering is cheap and warm. When you work hard and need to cool down to prevent sweating and becoming cold, you can do that.

It might not be a status symbol, but you are warm and your wallet is fat."
"Not all of them were written in the 21st century, but Iain M Banks's Culture books stack up with any sci fi I've read.

Anathem by Neal Stephenson.  I see Seveneves and Snowcrash below, but Anathem was vastly better than either in my opinion.

The Martian by Andy Weir.  It has it's critics and I get where they're coming from especially after Artemis, but I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it so it must have something going for it."
The cosmopolitan in Vegas! I always loved that hotel but what made it better is my husband upgraded it to where we had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain from our balcony and a Japanese jacuzzi tub as well. Definitely was hard to even leave the room.
I don't think black books is still on netflix.
"You‚Äôre missing bibliotik.me, it‚Äôs pretty hard to join though."
The piano:)
i like how innocent he sounds when he's about to click play on the live stream
Yes it does but other than a linux distro I will have windows 10 in case it is needed. Thanks for those points you mentioned!
Nah but I take them out of the fridge like 30 min before to take the chill off.

"I don't like how he stole credit for TZP. If you see the movie, it has a clear first half (focused on the kid, very sensitive and empathetic) and the second half where the hero and saviour makes an appearance. Very tonally different and it's obvious who directed what part."
"Watch the cinematography, listen to the dialogue, and dissect the character development, themes, and plot. It's a pretty serious movie with some lighthearted elements. 

Now compare it to a modern Marvel film. It's unreal how different they seem."
Troll 2
"Yeah it was blown out of proportion by critics. I just feel like a ton of people use ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù to mask what they mean, ‚Äúbad‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs not my number one but number six for this franchise is still *really* good!"
These are awesome... I added all but three of these to my playlist. Thanks for the info :)
My brother did a good job describing why he drinks energy drinks the other day. He is a carpenter and I work in IT at a desk all day. He said he cant drink coffee anymore at work because it just makes him want to relax. So he just pounds back an energy drink when he gets to work and is ready to start hammering nails all day. I on the other hand get to work with my coffee and relax at my desk while sipping that sweet java cup for the first hour of work.
"only on some products! the powerline ii is one of the few that have the lifetime warranty, the majority of the other usb cables anker sells only have an 18 month warranty."
"Don't bother lol.  Roll isn't bad, but Race is just so much better.  Every time I played Roll I found myself wishing it was Race."
"Yep, I think it would require one person dedicated to it."
"H-sina ,  is Denmark the warmest of the scandinavian countries? , so everyone has a bicycle , but what if it snowsü§îdo they put salt on bike trails? i lived in cold Vermont when married, but now i love living by coconut trees in key west... & thanx for fishN info"
"Week-long loops are tough. Doing a two car shuttle would let you do a chunk of one of the long trails.  Actually, doing part of the Long Trail in Vermont would be a good choice.  It's much more remote feeling than SNP is.  

I'd look at the White Mountains in New Hampshire. There's enough trails there that you could definitely do a week-long loop, or do an end-to-end with the AMC's shuttle service running you back to your car at the end. The scenery is about as epic as the east coast has to offer. There's a bunch of above treeline alpine hiking, waterfalls, moose, beaver, etc.  But it comes at a price; there's lots of restrictions on campsites, and you usually have to pay."
"exactly. our team has few players in prime years at the moment (25-29 age range). it's either players over 30 who's value has dropped or players in early 20s who didn't reach future value yet. starters in prime years are basically just livi, kova and broz."
"I don‚Äôt wanna sound like a 13 year old on YouTube answering FiRsT CoMmeNt but in this case I was the first person in the whole thread to write BP is overrated, and I had no idea it was a ‚Äúthing‚Äù. There was no crowd. Yet everyone just came charging through a hole in space while I was standing 300 feet below it."
