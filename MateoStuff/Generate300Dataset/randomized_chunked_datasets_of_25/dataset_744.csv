70472,Had to take two programming classes this past school year and I completely agree. Some of my classmates would often call to attention how much more they knew than the rest of us. I wasn't even really bothered by this until the professors started handing out pop quizzes and speeding up their coverage of the material because they began to think we were all that type of person. It really became that much more of a challenge for those like me who were new to all of this.,best major to study in college

26759,"I'm sorry, I'm just having a giggle over here trying to imagine how one laminates praise for a game.

But, seriously, to OP: **Terra Mystica** is the #2 game on BGG for a reason. It's a heavy Euro-style game, but it's a seriously amazing game that takes many of the same social interaction and area control aspects of Settlers and blows it up to an epic scale while still maintaining a fairly comprehensible rules set. It's a very complex game, but not a complicated one.",best board games
12829,"At age 17 my mom drained the college savings my grandmother left me for a tit job an tummy tuck. Soon after she left the family for a guy 10 years older than her, in the messiest way possible that nearly led my dad to suicide. A year after she tentatively came back (after getting scammed for nearly everything she had and having nowhere to go) 

Its been a year since, I'm not really sure what my standing is with her. Its... awkward",best gifts for mom

The only downside is about 60 min round trip each day of commuting, which I am more than happy do to because it saves money and keeps money in the family.",best freezer brand
