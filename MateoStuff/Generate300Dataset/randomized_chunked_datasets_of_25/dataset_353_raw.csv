"As a fellow language professional, I have to respectfully disagree here. ""Git gud"" is not really a constructive thing to say to someone asking for a simple tool to support their learning and gud-gitting.

Perfecting an L2 takes much time and effort. For the long game, yeah you're right, OP should constantly work to improve their command of the language, frequently check their favorite reference works and guides whenever doubt arises, and so on. But in the meantime, they just want something to help them in their everyday work.

MS Word spellchecker is fine, though I wouldn't rely on it too much for grammar and style. Still, it can be instructional in a general sort of way, as in ""Oh, *in order to* IS a needlessly wordy phrase, I never thought of it that way..."" Grammarly and all the other 3rd-party automatons don't improve much on Word's basic features imo; the only difference is that they cost extra."
I bought a Cyrill (speigen sister brand) silicone case from amazon for $9 CAD. Has anybody used one of these for another phone? Or have any idea how close it is to the Apple one?  If it is terrible Iâ€™ll just get an Apple one.
"You didn't need to be!  That should have been the first thought, to ask the professional for help."

Moscot Lemtosh. Classic and timeless.
I agree. That was the first one I thought of when I found this thread. I've gotten decent compliments with my prada carbon as well (sort of a sauvage clone) but my Bleu de Chanel EDP if by far my favorite and biggest compliment magnet

I'm about six episodes in and I haven't really gotten that 'gotta watch more' feeling yet. But I hear it's common to not be in love with it right away...true for you or was it pretty instant?
"A Banana. Seriously. An Orange. An apple. It doesn't take much. 

My fav is bacon, eggs, English muffin and a fruit. But during the week, I try to do a fruit and a cup of cottage cheese. That's all. Keeps me good til noon, and I'm a tub - 270 pounds of massive, manly, testosterone oozing man. 

Seriously, I think we over think breakfast."
