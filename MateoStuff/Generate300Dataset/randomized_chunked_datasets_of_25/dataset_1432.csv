I had the pleasure of talking to Lem personally and this is something I will never forget. He made me think differently about every aspect of my existence. It seems cliché when I say it but I truly believe in it."

28750,best breakfast foods,"> sausage

This is so difficult for a german speaker to translate, so I'll try to explain it for others: In here we make big sausages which are then cut into very thin slices and used like ham. This often causes confusions when translated to English."

16663,best pet for toddlers,"Leopard geckos are the most basic of reptiles to keep after the initial start to set it all up--if you aren't sqeamish about also keeping live bugs for them. I would say quite low-maintenance overall, with periodic need for cleaning the tank and obviously feeding every 2-3 days.

But the geckos themselves don't need a special light the way some lizards do (either for UV or for heat). 

--They need a warm area on one side of the tank so they can move around according to their temperature needs. You use an under-tank heater, which is a flat pad that's sticky on one side, you just slap it on underneath. 

--They need a ""damp hide"" for when they molt, to help their skin come off, a small tupperware box you keep damp, there are different ways to do this from keeping paper towel wet (easy but dries fast and can get moldy) to stuff like the ""frog moss"" i have in mine which comes in a box as dried chunks of moss that retain water for a long time after you wet them. 

--Weekly you need to feed them their crickets dusted with a couple kinds of (inexpensive) powdered vitamin/calcium. Helps keep their bones healthy.

Likewise you need to take care of your crickets--there is powdered food you can buy and premade gel to give them water (crickets are very stupid and will drown easily in a bowl of water). A couple of paper towel rolls in a tall-sided rubbermaid container with holes in the lid and you're good. 

Here are some pics of mine:  
- [Gecko face](http://imgur.com/NEoQg8B)  
- [Current tank](http://imgur.com/z6Eu004) (sorry about the reflections). This tank is a 30 gallon, I used to have gerbils in it years back. You can use a 20-gallon tank just fine too.   
- [Chilling at the rock pool](http://imgur.com/zZ8nAuT). I filled a low and wide plastic container with river rocks and water. The tupperware with the door cut out is her ""damp hide"", and the bowl in front with the powder is the calcium dust. Some people leave it in for on-demand feeding, some don't. (the second supplement still goes on the crickets even if the calcium powder is in the tank.)

My tank has ceramic tile on the bottom. Lots of people discourage using a sand substrate because if they eat it accidentally it can get impacted in their guts and kill them. Also tile is easy to wash."

29006,best breakfast foods,"I seem to order Joe's Special/Scramble at every breakfast/brunch spot I go to so it's probably my favorite breakfast item. It has eggs (egg whites for me), spinach, ground beef, mushrooms, onions, basil and oregano in it. It goes great with crispy hashbrowns and and an English muffin with strawberry jam. Oh yeah, and a mimosa! Chef John has a great [recipe](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2014/04/joes-special-true-original.html) for Joe's Special."
2506,best headphones,Sony mdr7506 or mdr v6 are what I use. The 7506 are much punchier with the bass and fit somewhat tightly. The v6 is like wearing a pillow and has a nice warm sound. Neither costs more than eighty bucks I think. I'm not sure since these pairs must be around 15 years old or something.
