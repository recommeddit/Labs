45258,"Cool, I appreciate your suggestions. It seems like there are no bad choices between PS4, Switch and Xbox.

Maybe I'll aim to buy all of them! Might take a while to free up enough cash for that though.

Which is the cheapest?

Thanks!",best gaming system

61951,"I will always recommend Tales of Berseria. My personal favorite of the series, with an excellent cast of characters and a well-refined battle system. Lots of fun to play through co-op with a friend. Thought the story did enough differently to give the series a breath of fresh air, so it's a bummer that it seems to have been a bit overlooked.",Best RPG game on PS4

53546,"So this is accurate. Cetirizine (Zyrtec), although a 2nd generation H1 antagonist, can cause a little bit of sedation. Loratadine (Claritin) and fexofenadine (Allegra), the other two most commonly used 2nd generation antihistamines, should not. People should know that antihistamines that cause sedation also help dry up secretions caused by allergies (i.e., lacrimation and rhinorrhea). Cetirizine is a wonderful compromise. It should cause much less sedation than first generation antihistamines (e.g., Benadryl), but still provide some help with secretions, which other second generation antihistamines will not. Hence, many doctors and pharmacists recommend it. If you don’t experience secretions as part of your allergies, go ahead and choose a different second generation antihistamine and be free from sedation. Disclaimer, we all respond differently to medications. If cetirizine knocks you out, that is unfortunate and not typical. As an aside, secondary to the small errors in this well intentioned post, I’d recommend always asking your local pharmacist questions. Cheers!",best medicine for a cold

10885,This is the information I've seen in the past. You can check an unloaded starter pistol in your luggage and your luggage ends up more secure and likely to reach your destination. If you have expensive equipment in your luggage it prevents concerns that people are stealing/damaging stuff. And no one wants to be the guy who lost a suitcase with a gun in it.,best suitcase lock

62517,"- The Witcher 3 (Full fledged, huge open world, high fantasy RPG)
- Nier Automata (Action-JRPG, with some of the most unique characters and writing you could hope for. Also, amazing music) 
- Horizon Zero Dawn (Great world and combat, light on the RPG elements) 
- Dragon Quest XI (Tradition style JRPG that feels like it was plucked out of an NES and rebuilt to be beautiful on the PS4)
- Final Fantasy XV (Action-JRPG with a cool road trip vibe that's unique in gaming. Not the best story of the franchise but absolutely worth a playthrough)
- Persona 5 (A fairly unique highschool Sim/Dungeon exploring JRPG that oozes style and plays a bit like a mature Pokémon)
- Dragons Dogma (Some of the best combat in the history of gaming, high fantasy and fun. A bit dated, but a lot to love)
- Bloodborne (It might not scratch your RPG-itch if you're looking for a big extravagant world, but this was my biggest surprise. I expected to despise this game and fell absolutely in love it, so I have to recommend it)",Best RPG game on PS4
