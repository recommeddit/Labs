44799,best items under $100,For me it was LiPo jumpstart pack. Just under $100. When I first saw how small and light it was I thought no way this will work. Have jump started my truck from dead several times over the years. Stays fully charged for 6 months. I canâ€™t count how many times I have used this to save me or other people.
