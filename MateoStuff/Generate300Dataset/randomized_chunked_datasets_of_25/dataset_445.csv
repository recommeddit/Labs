58754,best cologne,"Yup, I would agree with this.  
Fragrance-as-an-accessory is definitely looked down upon by enthusiasts, but I think if it's what you prefer, then it's ok, especially if you're young and trying to figure out where your preferences fall on the [fragrance wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragrance_wheel)."

45622,best gaming system,"He said he earns about 400$ a month, so if he has to pay bills and can save about 10 bucks it would totally make sense it takes time to save up. Just don't judge anyone for the money they have. Living from month to month can be very hard"
31832,best hotel to live in,"I usually stayed on the strip and just bought shuttle passes. The shuttle works pretty well. You just park your car at the World Market Center (I think that's the name) on first day show your printout and they give you a wristband for all 3 days. Pretty hassle free.

This year decided to stay at the Main Street Station and going to walk to the venue. I have stayed at the Downtown Grand before and it is a nice hotel. There is an awesome pizza spot across the street (forgot the name)"

54139,best medicine for a cold,"Wash your hands before touching your nose or eyes, so you never get a cold to begin with."
36308,best alcoholic drink,"Ah my son, you expose your own ignorance I'm afraid. I said the best bourbon. What you mention is not bourbon, and is wildly expensive"
35740,best alcoholic drink,"If I may make a little adjustment to your recipe, use ginger beer/spicy ginger instead of ginger ale. Total game changer"
9563,best toothpaste,"> I’m curious about the post above saying manual. 

If you are brushing properly, an electric brush will make little to no difference.

If you aren't, then an electric brush isn't likely to help.

In other words, an electric brush can give you a false sense of security and make you lazy, leading to you not brushing properly."
42595,best detective show,"The Fall is so fucking good. Incredible acting and such a great twist on the classic detective show. I’ve seen almost every show on the above list, and this show sticks with me more than any other - I find myself thinking about it all time. Watch it!"
52324,best hiphop album,">Theres a lot more to hip hop than Kendrick, just sayin'.

You should be telling the majority of rym's user base this, not me. I don't think he should have *two* albums in the top 10."
68873,best science fiction novel,"It took me a few chapters to get into the flow, but after that I really liked it. A thoughtful exploration of humanity in loneliness."
40279,best midrange CPU,"I looked up benchmarks and in gaming they seem to be extremely close, especially when I am gaming on a 1440p ultrawide, and 4k VR headset. Is there any reason at all to spend 50% more on the 5600x for strictly gaming? 

&#x200B;

I'm also surprised AMD hasn't released a 5600 non x or something else to compete with it in that segment, are they getting cocky lol?"

7800,best laptop for general use,"Hi, if you're specifically looking for a 15.6"" 2-in-1, that's definitely a very solid choice for the price. The only other option I would recommend looking at is the [**HP Envy x360 15""**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7169&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-15z-ee000-8mf60av-1). I provided the link to make a custom configuration. Either one would be a great choice for your uses. The HP Envy x360 15"" comes with a Ryzen 4000 processor and can be configured with a 400 nit display."

61382,Best RPG game on PS4,"Vampyre is free this month on ps+ don't know how good it is not played it yet. I think most of the older final fantasy games are on the store if you want nostalgia, possibly dragon quest 11 I loved every minute of that game.
Seen it mentioned already but divinity original sin 2 is deffo worth checking out.
Kingdom hearts, Kingdom of amular remake is out.
I personally feel detroit become human is a fantastic game, no combat but hell of a story and choices matter."
34830,best NFL player,"Believe me, err, Billieve me!! He makes me nervous a lot of times too :/ I hope he lets up a little on the running this season, and not even just that, sometimes he is so stubborn and won't go down. [This nearly gave me a damn heart attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVxMInnjWto) and I am shocked he was only out for one play after that. We dodged a huge bullet there!"
50497,best rap album,"Every buddy underestimates The Mouse and The Mask. Oh well, I guess Dangermouse's cartoony production isn't for everyone. But I think it's one of DOOM's most energetic, unique, and best albums."

45694,best trick or treating candy,whaaaaaaat? I love those!
2578,best headphones,"Hey Lachlan,

I have the Spirit One S I just picked up not too long ago. Although I have not tried any of the headphones you listed above, the Focals are not all that comfortable. It is not a problem for me since I never have headphones on for over an hour at a time so it's forgivable but for people who have them on for hours at a time should look elsewhere. I also have quite thick frames on my glasses and I did notice a slight bass leak due to the smaller cups and tighter clamping force but it's definitely something minor and doesn't detract from the overall listening experience imo. Ymmv."
