65982,best college in california,"Uh, no? Literally the opposite. If out-of-state students were removed, in-state low-income students would suffer the most."
56793,best desktop monitor,Asus VN248H-P. Was the most crisp monitor I've ever owned until upgrading to a 2k monitor recently. I've had 3. 1 for Xbox. They're amazing for the price.
14724,best romantic novel,"I wrote the modern-day version, City of Singles

36386,best alcoholic drink,"Tequila and Rum. Can't choose which I like more. Also, palm wine but it's not readily available in the US."
62476,Best RPG game on PS4,">  RPGs need branching paths, dialogue trees, persuasion, multiple ways to solve problems

I'll have to disagree with that. What about the RPGs that don't have these things? Like all the Final Fantasy games, Dragon Quest, Soulsborne, etc...? What do you consider those games?"
43566,best items under $100,If I had them near my desk I'd probably end up slowly pulling them apart cause I fidget with everything in reach
44132,best items under $100,"I would take this a step further and say marathon entry fee.  

Pick one that's 6 months to a year away, enter, then tell all your friends and family, let them laugh.  There's no better way to dig yourself out of a slump than to make yourself the protagonist of an underdog story."
61800,Best RPG game on PS4,Totally disagree.

14783,best romantic novel,"{Sunshine by Robin Mckinley} 

The way that McKinley writes is the perfect amount of detail for me. It's lyrical without being belaboring. Many authors describe very little of the scene, while others go overboard and are too descriptive (I don't want to know the exact playlist for every scene...). Mckinley harnesses our understanding of the everyday and blends it with her extraordinary fantasy setting. For example, most people know what a bakery looks and smells like. Mckinley leans into that but then also demonstrates why this bakery is very special. It's just the perfect amount of detail in every regard, very unique."
3565,best college for research,"Follow them on social media. If you want even create a special anonymous account for it, most schools have at least a minimal presence on instagram and plenty have a lot of accounts to follow, everything from dining, career services, activities planning, sports, and clubs. After a while you can start to get a feel for the campus vibe!"
37298,best amusement park,"It's rough out here in the Northwest, where I've lived my whole life. The only good park is Silverwood (no offense to Wild Waves and Oaks, but the former is primarily a water park and the latter is tiny), and I've never lived closer than 3 hours away from it, and am currently about 7 hrs away (I'm actually closer to Lagoon here at 5 hrs). Really wish I could have a ""home park"" to pop into a few times a month (or more) like a lot of you guys here have."
37005,best roller coaster at six flags,"Solid report. I went last Monday and actually enjoyed the park for the most part. The staff was great and the park was very clean. None of the rides are stand out for me, but Superman is solid but definitely not running like new, haha. I really liked it in the front row compared to back. Wild One, Jokers Jinx and Batwing I thought were fun. The park needs a big homerun ride like an RMC for sure."
53178,best hiphop album,"Listened to the whole thing, I really dig chasing ghosts, think that's my favorite. The lil changes in the speedmix is wild too. Keep it up man you're really good."
3895,best online college,"My friend is a hiring manager for a fortune 500 company- they dont hold only online degrees (Phoenix) up to same standard as an actual university, he wont hire anyone from online degree. Im not sure if everyone else is the same- but thought it was worth sharing."
38125,best Marvel movie,"I’m kinda surprised to see Age of Ultron omitted! It’s a good curated list otherwise, all of the movies you listed are indeed essential to the overall story."
55377,best action and adventure novel series,"I have, and red seas is also my favourite! mainly because of the pirate  ladies. but Republic was the last book of the series I'll likely read, because I got tremendously bored with flashback structure of the novels, that don't seem to serve a real point anymore."
49219,best gaming monitor,I got the LG 27GL850 and very happy with it! also you can not really go wrong with any dell
49636,best gaming monitor,I dont think resolution more than 1080p good for gaming and watching. Because mostly people will game and watch from 1080p source. It will get blurry if your 2k/4k monitor watching 1080p source
32,best terminal file manager reddit,"I used Norton Commander in the DOS times. Since then, I cannot live without an NC clone. It's the first thing that I need to install on a new system."
67272,axios alternatives reddit,Polyfills are your friend :)
1945,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Gino's, by far. Happy to see many comments that echo it. The pizza is great, sandwiches are great, the prices (especially lunch special) are great and their weird homemade ranch is just one of those things you crave once you have it."
24869,best spiderman actor,"Yes, best includes coolest."
2614,best headphones,I think they're definitely the ortho sweet spot for brand new cans. I'd much rather a NFB-15 + HE400i over a HE560 tbh.
73306,best Linux distro,"You can't go wrong with Manjaro with Gnome or any other Arch-based distribution. The AUR is godsent, Arch Wiki is extremely helpful and community is evergrowing, rapidly!"
