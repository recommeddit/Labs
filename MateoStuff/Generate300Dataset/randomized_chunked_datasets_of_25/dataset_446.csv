14783,"{Sunshine by Robin Mckinley} 

The way that McKinley writes is the perfect amount of detail for me. It's lyrical without being belaboring. Many authors describe very little of the scene, while others go overboard and are too descriptive (I don't want to know the exact playlist for every scene...). Mckinley harnesses our understanding of the everyday and blends it with her extraordinary fantasy setting. For example, most people know what a bakery looks and smells like. Mckinley leans into that but then also demonstrates why this bakery is very special. It's just the perfect amount of detail in every regard, very unique.",best romantic novel

None of the rides are stand out for me, but Superman is solid but definitely not running like new, haha. I really liked it in the front row compared to back. Wild One, Jokers Jinx and Batwing I thought were fun. The park needs a big homerun ride like an RMC for sure.",best roller coaster at six flags
