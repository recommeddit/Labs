Ha. Lowe’s is my favorite but mostly because they are pet friendly.
"In my experience, honey and lemon in tea. Dash of cinnamon for luck."
Do you plan on staying connected to an external monitor while gaming?
Yes it works very well...
"Hot toddies. Mine are simple, super hot black tea and whiskey or cherry brandy. Drink at least three a night until cold is gone."
just straight zsh. Don't see the need for a dedicated file manager.
"Overnight oats work really well for me. I prepare it the night before and stick it in the fridge and grab it the next morning.

2 cups of oats


1 cup of frozen berries


2.5 cups of milk (I like to add a liiiiittle bit of water too)


1 tbsp of chia seeds


Honey to taste


Plus any other fruits (I like ripe bananas)"
"RHEL... because the need your business/money as much as they need the community, and work for both."
"I did a christmas stocking exchange with my dentist neighbor last year, and the stocking he gave me was stuffed with tiny bottles of toothpaste. At first I thought it was cute. ""Awww.. he's so into dentistry that he gives toothpaste as gifts."" Then I realize he's just a cheap bastard that gave me a bunch of free samples from his office.

He dresses up as the tooth fairy and gives out the same toothpaste on Halloween. (Plus candy)"
Pretty much anything I enjoy EXCEPT Mounds/Almond Joys....ugh.
What if the president was spiders//!!1!!?/?/?////????
"Navy is a clicky switch, and about as heavy as stock switches come (you can by springs much heavier than their 90 grams, but you're modding the switch). The click bar of the Navy (and lighter weight box jade) is very distinct though.

I know you said you didn't want to, but I still think a switch sampler is still the right move here."
"You're right there are definately more packages in the AUR then there are in OBS. Dont know about stability though, afaik all TW packages are at least tested in openqa before release and i've never encountered any installation breaking updates. But i've never used Arch so i can't really compare them."
"I have a better way. I wrap my meat in Saran Wrap. Very, very tightly so all the air is out. No freezer burn. Then I throw a piece of aluminum foil over that. Works like a charm."
Mirror? I'm on mobile and the link is dead.
"Watched the “Cats” series and fortunately it moves slowly enough that one has time to ff through the worst parts, the parts you know you’ll never be able to remove from your brain once you’ve seen them. Query: did they actually show it? Or was it blurred out? Just knowing what was happening was bad enough."
I’m from the northeast and I don’t think anyone thinks this.
Patxis is more than acceptable haha. It's great and does the job.  Takes 50 min to make a deep dish tho
Wyze camera. Awesome product for the price.
"I'll add compatibility info.

I found some of those links as I failed to get the upload version work in any convincing way.

Uploads are still a work-in-progress, and probably deserving of a stronger warning of it's compat... (Assuming I can get it reliably working)"
Yes.  Edit: Some other version exists?
"This js disgusting and I hate you but it looks like it took a lot of time to draw so have my updoot, please never make xi jinping so horrifying ever again"
"Ooh I like this one, too!"
Oops. It was not. Thanks for catching that!
"I'm with you. Even people I know who like the theme and type of game admit that they ""never"" table it because of the setup and the overall dedication required."
