"People may say you'll just piss out the vitamins but I take a shitload of vitamin C as soon as I start feeling the symptoms of a cold. Too lazy to look it up now but I'll take close to 10 vitamin C pills a day. When you get diarrhea, then you know you took enough. 

In the last 5 years, I haven't had a cold last longer than a day because of this."
"The controversy was largely around the new SmartHDR feature that was introduced with the XS. It had a tendency to create less natural images due to aggressive shadow brightening. This was especially bad on human skin since it flattened the texture by removing the shadows from your pores, giving a sort of skin smoothing effect."

"It's not. It doesn't even have basic features. It looks clean, yes, so does sileo, and I'd use Cydia over Sileo any day.

That said, I have not tried the latest update, and I might do that now. I probably will still use Cydia because it's just so reliable and nostalgic."

"I find that really hard to believe. Even if they don't recognize ""Carowinds"", I've met loads of people who've heard of ""that giant green coaster in South Carolina... what's it called?"" ""Fury 325"" ""yeah I guess – I saw an article on it a few years ago"""

"I haven't bought plastic water bottles in over a decade and use reusable (insulated metal) water bottles for the car but had a Brita pitcher at home.

But then I installed one of these in my kitchen about a year and a half ago:

It's friggin awesome, I have a separate tap for filtered water that we use for drinking, making coffee, etc. I feel so fancy when I use it but it's really not that expensive and wasn't hard to install either. Well I had a handyman buddy of mine do it so it was super easy ha ha."

"I second Butcher's *Harry Dresden* series, super fun urban fantasy (don't let the writing in book one stop you, it gets exponentially better).  *His Dark Materials* trilogy by Pullman, *The Mists of Avalon* by Zimmer-Bradley are huge favorites.  While not strictly fantasy, I loved Anne Rice's *Witching Hour* trilogy too."

"Flossing saves your gums.  You'll notice this later in life if you haven't flossed.

One quick test is if you floss and you smell the floss and any part of it smells like death, that's kinda obvious.  If you floss just a few times a week, or up to once a day, parts of your mouth will no longer smell like death.

And they smell like death due to the stuff decaying in there between your teeth and gums as the bacteria lay down some nice cement and start to build their homes.  

FLOSS, DAMN YOU!

**EDIT:** plaque bacteria are like coral.  The plaque hardens to the calculus/tartar and the bacteria make their homes in there.  You're got a nice budding coral reef starting under your gums.  After your gums die off, the fish and eels can finally start moving in.  But really, the bacterial plaque hardens up due to the calcium ions in your salivia and forms a home for the bacteria to live in.  And this pushes away your gums and ligaments and then bone.  And the bone doesn't come back.

So, FLOSS DAMN YOU!"
