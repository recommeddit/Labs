50644,best rap album,"Bro it'sjust not even the right place to ask this question. No disrespect but make a post, don't put it in thread asking about something completely different."
71168,best movies with a cool twist,Any movie mentioned in this thread will be ruined if you haven't seen it already.  Plot twists are supposed to be a surprise that you didn't see coming.  Not something that you're actively looking for and anticipating.

Also (although unrelated to the topic of file management): rest of `moreutils` is also worth getting familiar with."

61863,Best RPG game on PS4,"I think you misunderstood me.
 
I didn't say that ARPGs are not RPGs. They definitely are, and has always been.
 
But many games are described now as RPG, when they would be more of action or adventure games.
 
What I said is that almost any game now try to fit in the RPG genre in description, because the name is appealing more than before.
 
I love both types, turn based or action."

73743,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Cool of you to try some comparisons.

I had a chance to try out Paperlike since that's what my pal uses, but opted to get iCarez and just upgrade if the quality was worse for mine. iCarez is very smooth, easy to install, and the quality was very similar. I think the fineness the the matte finish makes the screen quality drop equally to the Paperlike but the trade off is worth it to me and you get used to it."
