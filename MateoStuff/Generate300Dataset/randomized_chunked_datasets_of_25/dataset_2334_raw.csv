"Hugh Jackman, the man is Australia's answer to Keanu

Edit: nearly 4k up doots, holy crap, even his name does good things for people, thanks everyone."
It’s worth it if you need the drop protection but at the cost of making your phone much heavier and bigger.
"I've been so obsessed w that album (and their last one before that)

The transitions are so great, the hooks are catchy as hell.

Bossa Nova Corps -> Kno U is crazy (no pun intended)

I also love the ""motherfucking gami gang"" at the start of ""Isopropyl Alchemy"" and the *Jimmy Newtron* sample I forget which song. It's a really good synthesis of pop punk sensibilities and math rock/metal intricate guitar work."
Frig off Randy
Where can you get one?
I paint my rooms with RGB.
"Sociolinguistics is not so much why language changes as it is how language impacts society and how society impacts language.

Job wise, there are some linguistics jobs with the government, some with search engines (Google keeps a few), some forensic linguistics jobs (decoding a recording that will be used as evidence in a criminal case), and a few codebreaking things. Not a whole lot, but there are options not in academia."
To be fair if I was doing all of that I'd also do my best to avoid any legal attention.
Whens Daiquiri ice making a comeback?
I heard a lot of great things and terrible things about paperlike. There is so much controversy over this brand I am just super confused at this point haha
Omg yes. Every single boy I knew back then smelled of Cool Water. Reminds me of awkward kisses at the skating rink any time I catch a whiff now.
Holy shit this is legit as fuck
"I’m a sports writer at a new sports publication, so I feel an obligation to support The Athletic.

Besides that, I subscribe to two local area newspapers, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal."
Who knew the guy in the hairpiece was Bruce Willis the whole time?
"The stars my destination
Childhood's End
Martian Time-Slip"
Bloody Mary - it’s a meal in a glass.
"Good, that's a relief :)"
Are you 100% certain of that? I’ve never seen WP more than ~$100.
Saint Paul has a lot of old clay pipes for sure.
"I call it a Russian Lemonade.

Vodka. Ice. Lemons. Like a whole lemon cut up, but not squeezed. Let it slowly sink in. No sugar. Nothing else.

Mid-range Vodka works fine, don't use anything worse than Smirnoff. Make it very cold."
Pro-tip (at least for the 30-40 y/o male crowd here): Pandora + Welcome to the Jungle station = Win.
"I fully agree, although if it wasn't for his injury then his value would also be higher"
The reviews read really great but a case with a cutout for the Apple logo is the mark of the douche (IMHO). I loved the Spigen Neo Hybrid until the bumper broke after 3 months and Spigen support told me to pound sand.
"i agree with this but these jobs are just as competitive to get as many engineering jobs as their are more applicants and they offer better employment opportunities than most engineering jobs IMO. hard accounting skills are useful, even if you aren't an accountant."
"Yep.  
Pretty great arrangement. Can watch anything you want."
