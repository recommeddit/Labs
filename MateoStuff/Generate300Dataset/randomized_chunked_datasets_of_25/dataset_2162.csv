56973,best water brand,"If I'm gonna pay for bottled water I want it to be at least semi-interesting... I think my favorite is **Apollinaris**, the so-called ""Queen of Table Waters"" that has been bottled in Germany since 1852. It's lightly carbonated, has 25% of your daily recommended magnesium intake, and is very very slightly salty. Also the preferred water of Patrick Bateman, how's that for snob appeal?"

And Gino's on Figueroa is classic."

23376,best car racing video game,It's still pretty aracdey compared to the more serious sim racing games (with a good amount of assists to tweak to your liking). But it has one of the best and most fleshed out campaign modes out of all the racing games.

30534,best Mexican war to study,"I just opened my copy of *Battle Cry of Freedom* and can verify that there is no coverage of Chapultapec. While he lightly touches on the strategy of the Mexican War, there is no discussion of the battles of that war, except insofar as they relate to the Civil War, whether it be in regard to participants, tactics, strategy, etc. Although a fantastic book, it's probably not a great for OP's purposes."
