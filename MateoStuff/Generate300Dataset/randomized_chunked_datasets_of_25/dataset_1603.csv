Eating one large meal likely isn't as bad for you as you think, it can allow you to eat less in total but keep up your metabolism."

25357,best spiderman actor,"Yeah handsome but not a straight up model face like maybe MJ or something. Peter is not ugly but neither is Tobey or Tom. Andrew is just way too handsome if you ask me.

How is Mary Jane poorly written? Need some explaination on that matter because that's what most people tend to say but that's subjective. What's your reason behind it."

2. Planet Earth 1 + 2

3. The Office

4. Documentary Now

There are documentaries that I'm glad I watched and are probably better made, like Icarus, but these are my favorites. And I'm counting the last two, close enough."

34128,best NFL player,You are basing that off of 2yrs. Lets see if he is consistent and if he can keep it up for at least another two years. He needs to win because of his QB skills not because of his defense for me to even consider him in that category.

26779,best board games,"Definitely add:

**Cash n' Guns** to your list.  It is an amazingly fun 4-8 player social/bluffing game which includes foam guns in the box for pointing at your friends to rob them of loot you stole.  Always a good time.

**Machi Koro** is another new gateway game. A great Japanese city builder.  Can be taught in less than 5 minutes. 

**Lords of WaterDeep** - a fun worker placement game.

**Smash Up** - excellent competitive card game where you pick 2 factions and smash them together into your deck and fight over area control.  Tons of variety with constant expansion.  My wife beats me every time."

41095,best instrument to play,"I disagree. The key system is not intuitive. It's ass backwards IMHO. 

I can play keys (I had a career doing sound design and music for games), but I wouldn't recomend it as a first to others.

If you are looking to play keyboards, I've seen complete beginners perform miracles on a hexagonal keyboard, but clearly that won't help here.
