Also wanted a built in stand for watching videos and options were limited for a good case that has that but still lays flat and without extra bulk.

There'll always be 3-4 other teams ranked around your level plus a further 4-5 that can beat you on a good day, not to mention the additional handful of sides that might very well take points off you if your team aren't going at 100% on matchday.

That's without taking into account that even the biggest superstar of a team is unlikely to play more than 6 or 7 tournaments over his career. You don't get many opportunities.",best soccer team in the world

42551,"If you want to watch an excellent movie I suggest you ¨36 Quai des Orfèvres¨ It´s a fantastic   French movie partially inspired by actual facts. It´s not the usual crime movie. It´s about a competition between two French cops seeking promotion as Head of the Parisian Criminal Investigation Department (the title is the address of that Department). This competition  becomes increasingly ruthless and blurs the usual lines of morality involving all the Department, until it is really difficult to distinguish the good and the bad guys. Besides, also the setting (the Parisian criminal underworld) is very intriguing. Finally, the director is a former cop (so he knows that environment).",best detective show
