5003,best home improvement store,"HD loaned me $1k in materials for my eagle scout project after Lowe's laughed at me. 10 years later, I enjoy spending my shittons of money at HD now.

Edit: gifted $1k in materials."
5142,best home improvement store,Neither if I can avoid them. I prefer Menards for the selection and price. Just a better store imo.
51483,best iphone case,"I haven’t read too much into the others at this point bc price was the biggest factor right now for me. Also wanted a built in stand for watching videos and options were limited for a good case that has that but still lays flat and without extra bulk. I currently have an iPhone X and I’ve had a Spigen case on it for years. No complaints, they always have solid products"

27496,best bollywood actor,"I think you missed the /s. 

He's a capable actor, no doubt about it. But to say he's some kind of GOAT actor is just bizarre."
34801,best NFL player,Someone called him DeShaun Cosby in another thread and it was kinda awful and funny all at once
35442,best alcoholic drink,Hooo SHIT!
25118,best spiderman actor,The people behind Tom Holland understand the character far better than the folks that worked with Toby. I'm not saying Tom Holland earns 100% of the credit or even that he's a better actor than Toby. With all factors at play he is by far the best Spider Man.
34431,best NFL player,"Jesus TO is HOF no doubt but i don't see how you can put him in the same sentence as Jerry and Moss. As for Marvin, if you put arguably in front of his name then sure."
66673,best soccer team in the world,"Super fucking hard to win titles om the international level even with great players though. There'll always be 3-4 other teams ranked around your level plus a further 4-5 that can beat you on a good day, not to mention the additional handful of sides that might very well take points off you if your team aren't going at 100% on matchday.

That's without taking into account that even the biggest superstar of a team is unlikely to play more than 6 or 7 tournaments over his career. You don't get many opportunities."
20189,best workout music,"Gods gonna cut you down - Johnny Cash

The beat of the song is perfect for running. I don't know why but something about that song really just gives me the chills and amps me the fuck up"
26425,best politician,YOU ARE ENTITLED TO NOTHING!
42551,best detective show,"If you want to watch an excellent movie I suggest you ¨36 Quai des Orfèvres¨ It´s a fantastic   French movie partially inspired by actual facts. It´s not the usual crime movie. It´s about a competition between two French cops seeking promotion as Head of the Parisian Criminal Investigation Department (the title is the address of that Department). This competition  becomes increasingly ruthless and blurs the usual lines of morality involving all the Department, until it is really difficult to distinguish the good and the bad guys. Besides, also the setting (the Parisian criminal underworld) is very intriguing. Finally, the director is a former cop (so he knows that environment)."
70402,best major to study in college,"English. Was too afraid to major in humanities, but the few English electives I took were the only instances I enjoyed learning/being at college."
3613,best college for research,Is there a particular reason that France seems to have a significantly lower density of top 1000 universities than its neighbors?
62721,Best Data Science textbook,Thank you fellow covfefe lover.
58722,best cologne,Do you think you could solve the problem with the moderate projection by simply spraying more or would that make it be unpleasant for the people around you?
63542,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"I probably use Cydia or zebra at least 10x a day if not more. For updates especially but also to score new tweaks and uninstall others. Constantly trying to perfect my layout and flow and more than anything fictionality and stability.
If everything just worked perfectly I probably wouldn’t use them any less lol."
65530,best phone service company,Born and raised Alaskan here. T-Mobile is non-existent. Go with either ATT or Alaska Communications (ACS). With ACS you can get a killer internet/cell/cable deal too
24326,best anime,A very nice list. Would be interested in a movie version.
