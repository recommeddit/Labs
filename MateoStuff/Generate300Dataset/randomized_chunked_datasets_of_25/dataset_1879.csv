67764,axios alternatives reddit,"Speaking of problems with the article...

> It is a terrible behavior for Fetch to receive a 500 status code from the server and treat it as 200.

That's not even true. People only get this idea because the promise doesn't automatically reject. Fetch behaves like this because it makes a distinction between a network error (the server can't be reached for whatever reason), and a completed request where the response happens to have an HTTP error code.

If you don't like that design regardless, you still have the option of rejecting when `!response.ok` or `response.status === 500`, etc."

70242,best major to study in college,"Been there. Art school isnâ€™t cheap. If youâ€™re okay with being tens of thousands of dollars in debt for a degree that even if you complete wonâ€™t get you any closer to a job except office work, have at it but you can learn how to write without getting into debt for it. Find the writer communities where you live and go to workshops and read your ass off, learn to meditate and visualize imagery as hard as you can, and youâ€™ll be in the same boat as everyone who graduates minus the student loans."
40949,best instrument to play,"I wanna say percussion is not just rhythmic training lol itâ€™s a very wide range of instruments that all require different techniques. Drum set, snare drum, mallet keyboards, and timpani are all just as difficult to master as any given string or wind instrument. Shit even tamborine has advanced techniques that you canâ€™t just do without training. And if youâ€™re a percussionist you have to master all of them lol"
