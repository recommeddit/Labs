5957,"I was really just talking about scaling when I mentioned ""You aren't gonna need it"".

When it comes to schema design, that's an area where I would take the opposite attitude.  With schema design, you really want to ensure it won't be hard to expand/change things in the future.  

[Here's a related quote on the subject from Linus Torvalds](https://lwn.net/Articles/193245/):

He was talking about git there, but it makes sense when thinking about a good SQL schema - vs using stuff like NoSQL in order to write less code or deal with scaling. The most important thing is your data structure (SQL schema).  There's better ways to solve performance issues without making compromises to the schema design.

But obviously need to balance what's worth putting more time into now -vs- unlikely to be needed any time soon.

I suggest normalizing the database as much as possible.  And make lots of uses on SQL VIEWs that JOIN tables together for most of your output/read queries.  I'm finding that more and more now, that I very rarely queries tables directly for the ""R"" (read) in CRUD.  Most of my queries used for displaying existing records to users comes from SQL VIEWs.  Makes things much simpler when dealing with permissions and soft-deletes etc too.",best programming language for web development

5897,"Seconding this. I've been writing a chess engine recently and for performance reasons I had to switch from Python to Golang, and I've been loving Go so far. It has pretty much most of what you want in a modern, compiled programming language.

In fact, Go honestly seems to follow Python's Zen better than Python does sometimes lol. Which...can be a good and bad thing sometimes (for example there's no ternary operator, since Go's philsophy is that there should be one, unambiguous way of doing something. But you get used to things like this pretty quick, and sometimes it really does  make you to write cleaner code).

Oh, and the learning curve wasn't bad at all. Now keep in mind I have experience programming, so Go might not be the language to start with (emphasis on the might), but it's definitely a great modern language. 

So OP and others, definitely check Go out, especially for people coming from languages like Python and Ruby who are hesitant to dive into a language like C++.",best programming language for web development
