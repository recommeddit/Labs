That plus the hinge design makes them pretty much unbreakable.

16865,"Ehh, a lot of fish *can* live in bowls, but it's unless you're properly changing the water every other day and testing often for chemical levels, it's actually a pretty miserable experience for the fish. 

If you're doing it properly, a betta fish should have at least a five gallon tank, but ideally s ten. You should get a proper nitrogen cycle going in your tank before you even purchase your fish, and then it needs to be properly heated and filtered. 

Betta fish are marketed as easy to keep in a unfiltered, small bowl/trendy mason jars because ""they live in puddles"" in their natural habitat, but it's only for a very short dry season. In reality, they're long distance swimmers for being such small fish. With proper care, Bettas can live an average of 3-5 years captivity, and often longer. They have personalities, can learn tricks, and they do develop a sort of basic attachment to their caretakers. 

I don't mean anything against you personally! I just hate the misinformation spread by pet stores who benefit from selling as many as they can, and try to combat it as often as possible. It's cruel for the fish and disappointing for the child when their new pet passes away in a month from accidental poor care.",best pet for toddlers
