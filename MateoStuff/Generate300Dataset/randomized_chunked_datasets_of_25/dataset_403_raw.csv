"I second Wallet! Its free tier is just unmatched by any other free tier of any other personal finance app. Up to three accounts, inviting UI, and almost set and forget if you set up your planned payments right. :)"

We also have great views of the Tetons with fewer people than the Wyoming side. 

If you're into more hardcore camping/backpacking there are all sorts of amazing places in central Idaho."

My first girlfriend in high school wore it. Going on 20 years later if I smell it I turn completely dumb. Spray it on a dead raccoon and ill ask it out.

"I invested a 100e into a game capture card and connected my DSLR into it. So if you have a Camera with a HDMI output you can do the same and the quality will be a lot better than what most webcams can achieve :) I made a video on that matter: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yhMBbH3kk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yhMBbH3kk)

"1. Luther 
2. Sherlock

Both of these series have a ton in common with TD.  Despite these listed being BBC with a bit different formatting as American TV, they all have common themes and moods. For instance, they all have amazing Detective Protagonists. Luther (Idris Elba) specifically shines because of how dark and convoluted crime-solving can be. His hands aren’t always clean, but he does what needs to be done in order to solve rather disturbing puzzles. It’s wild. Sherlock is a bit different considering it has some humor to it; however, it can get very dark as well. Both are suitable choices to scratch that TD itch. Trust me I’ve been there. Lol 

TL;DR: Luther and Sherlock are both very dark, unsettling detective dramas that center around protagonists who aren’t always on the straight and narrow but will always find a way to stop evil by putting themselves in harms way."

"A lot of these remedies seem to be based on only one or a few studies. This isn't sufficient evidence to support the use of a remedy. I'd consider this a very nonconservative list, and should probably be taken with a grain of salt."

Word trickled out that the European nations planned on restricting US trade, creating a trade union that would be similar to today's EU, only (more) exclusionary and protectionist."
"I'll politely disagree. Imo, it can't carry enough stuff to be a daily workhorse college backpack. It's great for bringing stuff to the office or gym, but there are way better options for campus"

If you're comfortable with Makefiles (and you can make them much simpler than some do!) then look for a text editor with just a little more....

I quite like geany, it gives intelliguess functionality (""predictive text"") and also will list functions and variables in the side bar which can be very useful for rapid navigation of code.

while it does have an integrated terminal I prefer to alt-tab to a separate terminal to maximize the size of the code window.

available for Linux, Mac, and other more difficult to use OS's [https://www.geany.org/](https://www.geany.org/)"
