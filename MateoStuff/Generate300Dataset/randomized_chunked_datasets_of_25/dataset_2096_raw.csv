"I'd say that you should look at business grade devices if you want good build quality. So, Latitude from Dell, EliteBooks from HP, ThinkPads from Lenovo, etc. I don't think that any company offers as good user repairability as they once did in the past, unfortunately, but there are still good options out there."
Waiting for mod approval. I'm a new user.
"Well, and I do try to be respectful at all, but if I say that those people are doing something racist am I calling them racists?  And does ""racist"" have to be boiled down to just an insult?  It's not like I'm just calling people assholes."
"It still sucks when they steal not-so-valuable stuff. When I flew to Argentina, I had my brand new adidas sandals and dress shoes stolen out of my luggage (I had a lock). Both were inexpensive but I needed those items so I was pretty pissed."
"Libre and The One are too thick and creamy for me.  I liked the opening of The One.

I love Black Opium (only for cool weather nights for me) and Black Orchid is amazing I love it but will probably never own it.  I have Mon Paris and am still trying to find my poison but I think this one is on my short list."
Is it related to Gino's in Buellton? Best pizza in the SYV for sure.
"Anc isn't good for gaming sadly it's why most companies don't mess with it. It negativity affects not only audio quality but also gaming preformance.

RF wireless is honestly dying.

Bluetooth is so much more advanced and better, it will be the future of wireless. For headsets it is limited for bandwidth for a good mic."
"Yeah, the Sinnoh games are excellent. They have a sort of sharpness or cleanness to them that I feel HGSS lacks. It could be nostalgia, though; Pearl was my first video game."
"Ill check them out. Currently alternating between a pair of Spyder 3M mittens, and Oakley's Leather gloves 15k. Both pairs I got under $30 on sale, but the Spyder gloves are far superior. Hands never get cold or wet"
"I got my mom a brand old Nexus 4! It's two years old never been opened, but it's a Nexus, so it can still run Android 5.0 with zero bullshit. I spent all night upgrading it through every major and minor Android version that's come out in the last two years, and charging the battery inductively, so she gets to be the first person to actually take it out of the wrapper and peel the screen protector things off, and it'll be ready to go.. I'll be turning it over to her in less than an hour :D

After she moves into it and whatnot, I'll replace the radio firmware so that it can use 4G too."
"That doesn't actually happen, I just made that up as a test. Darth Vader is actually a gungan."
Would you mind sharing a picture of you have it on u to our own phone?
"Firefox -- sorry -- but these days, for anyone who cares about privacy just one bit -- time to move from Chrome"
"‘Arrival’ has one of the smartest twists I’ve ever seen in a film. A brilliant, underrated gem."
Didn't he make a website just for the poster you can't buy?
"Guerlain Gourmand Coquin 
Hermès Rhubarbe Ecarlate
Hermès Un Jardin Sur Le Toit"
I haven't seen the movie.  What does it turn into?
"dentist here.  depends how much whitening you're looking for.  if its just a little, maybe try crest whitestrips or similar product over the counter.  if its more than a little, i'd recommend seeing your dentist and getting trays made, then tx with carbamide peroxide overnight for a week."
+1 for $SUICIDEBOY$
"Tried it out just now. Does it crash your MS Word while quitting the application?

If I enable it, use it, then disable it, quit MS Word - this crashes Word."
I refused to believe my state’s favorite Halloween candy is frickin Milk Duds...
[snugally.com](http://snugally.com) I personally know the owner and she literally hand picks artisans and products. Small selection but good quality stuff.
"I thoroughly hated FF15. It had a lot going for it but I felt like it shot itself in the foot in too many ways.

It’s just a hate it or love it game. 

Glad you were the latter."
I thought the MCU connection brought that movie up rather than holding it down. It's my favourite Spider-Man film.
Watch him as he goes.
