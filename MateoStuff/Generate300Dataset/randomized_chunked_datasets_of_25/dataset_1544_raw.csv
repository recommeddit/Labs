"Vim personally. Simple, but has everything I need. I've looked into other options, but personally none provide anything that would make me want to stay. Emacs seemed promising, but I quickly learned that it would be a challenge because I was born deformed (I only have 10 fingers)."

WHAT?!"
Disappointed because of lack of Bangarang. That song will literally boost your squat by 20 pounds.
Try using their hosted UI....FML
Just a quick bit of research and I think I may also join this waiting room.
I know— but it’s better than nothing. I ended up buying from there for garden bed supplies and it was nice to basically get a gift card back.
"It's not any more dangerous than an 18-year-old skydiving.  Drop zones are concerned about liability, though, and in the USA this becomes exponentially more complicated when someone under 18 is involved."
"Feminine, in touch with your emotions and proud of it--except for what you would consider the more base emotions like anger, which you strongly abhor."
"Many of the Elizabeth Arden - Green Tea line. I've only disliked one of the several I've tried, Green Tea Mimosa. The rest have all been likable to one degree or another. And they're really inexpensive."
Superagent is a popular choice as well. I've never used it myself but I'm familiar with the API since I've used supertest for testing. I've had good experience with it.
"I would say Dasani because it tastes like metal, but nestle is just a shitty company and I’ll take metal over giving them any of my money"

"Depends, if I'm getting back on the piss then yeah, hair of the dog, if I'm hungover and not going anywhere, the best I can manage is a strong cup of tea!!!"
"The 90s East Coast bias was always justified though: better producers, better lyricists, better concepts, classic LPs like Illmatic, The Infamous, Ready To Die, 36 Chambers, OB4CL, Capital Punishment, IDAHIH, The Sun Rises In The East....plus it's the damn birthplace of this genre. What's to hate?

Also, most of the 90s West Coast g-funk was fucking dumpster juice anyway."

[The reviews on Amazon aren't very kind. Very expensive and not as strong as it claims to be.](http://www.amazon.com/Milockie-17312-Hotel-Safe-Lock/dp/B0042WWMA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399656802&sr=8-1&keywords=hotel+safe+lock)
Persona 5. It’s absolutely fantastic. The intro is a bit slow but after that you just wish that the game lasts forever. Best 110 hours I’ve ever spent in a game.
"Hard to say. Everyone is different.

I currently own Sennheiser HD58X, Philips Fidelio X2HR, Philips SHP9500 and AKG K702.

I found the 58X and X2HR not very good for FPS gaming where as they are recommended often (And why I bought them in the first place). The SHP9500 are better for gaming for me although no patch on the K702 imo."
"TIL about bedsheets, American health care system."
Thanks. Will check it out.
"First off thanks for the great review, cleared up some things for me. One question I do have is how does the glide of the raiden compare to that of the otsu v2? I am currently deciding whether or not I want to try out a v2 but I also really love the raiden's glide and I wouldn't want to lose too much of that. I just want to confirm with someone who owns both pads before I pull the trigger on a new otsu v2. Thanks in advance"
"Firefox, easily. Great privacy settings which is a priority for me."

"You won't die from drinking alcohol while taking acetaminophen, as long as it's both in moderation. A cocktail with your Sunday brunch and 1,000 mg of acetaminophen will only take 6-8 hours to metabolize."
"Awesome, this is happiness for a lifetime under $10.."
