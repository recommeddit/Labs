1946,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Definitely Gino’s. Big floppy slices and perfectly chewy dough. Simple and delicious. 

Woodstock’s tastes like marinara sauce and breadsticks. You can ask for “thin crust” but it just means they don’t fold the crust over to make that disgusting sauce pocket. I actually think their gluten free crust is decent - it’s more like a thin crust pizza.  But overall Woodstock’s would be my last choice other than Pizza Hut."
65320,best phone service company,"Whatever you choose avoid PCmobile.at all costs (PCmobiletalktous@loblaw.ca). They are the worst. Terrible service. Terrible customer service. They double bill, suspend service for unknown reasons and you'll spend hours on the phone trying to fight for what you paid for. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid"

55558,best action and adventure novel series,"*Mistborn*, Brandon Sanderson

*Codex Alera*, Jim Butcher

*Memory, Sorrow and Thorn*, Tad Williams

I really, *really* enjoyed all of these. (Which is not the same as saying they're good, as I'm very much aware.) They all feature their own big fantasy world to explore and lose yourself in, suitably epic stories and stakes and an enjoyable (and sizeable!) cast of characters to follow along and come to care about. I'd rank them as firmly high fantasy, like Lord of the Rings."

It's one of it's flaws actually, there isn't really any big replayability factor you can obviously pick different cars and upgrade them differently but there isn't much to it since it's very linear, it also has a weak endgame
