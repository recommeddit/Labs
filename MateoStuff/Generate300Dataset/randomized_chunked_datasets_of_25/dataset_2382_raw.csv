"People said the same about our NT between 2000-2008, but the unfancied, boring 2016 was the one to win. Labelling them a golden generation just adds extra pressure."
Grammarly does not pick up on comma splice run-ons or any of the sentence structure/length issues that crop up so often-- unless you pay for premium features.
:(  Too bad. They looked great. And this is coming from a guy who has  had two pairs of full prices Wayfarers stolen.
I‚Äôve ordered the Apple iPhone 11 Clear Case.  I‚Äôll probably pick up a leather option too
"Former Prime Minister on New Zealand Helen Clark. She pushed through Civil Unions, legalised prostitution, created the New Zealand super fund and Kiwisaver, got a Free Trade deal with China (along with Brunei, Chile, Singapore, and Thailand), started the TPP,  got rid of fighter pilots from the Air Force, made student loans interest free, unbundled the local loop for phone lines, cut child poverty, and reunited Labour with the left after the Lange government insanity while maintaining fiscal logic.

I really hope that she becomes UN Secretary General (even though I know that probably won't happen)"
"Easy... my Sony MDR-7506 headphones. I live in an apartment building with 59 other tenants and the walls are paper thin. I've had mine since 2012 and other than having to replace the ear pads a time or two, they've held up very well."
Same here. Great monitor!
"In practice I believe we can see good playing skills as something objective - you play good if you sound good. How good you are is the subjective part I think. As such, in my view the piano would still be one of the easiest instruments because you'd be able to sound good, good in any given measure, fairly quickly."
Don't forget the mayonaise if you watch him. You gonna need it.
Classic chocolate
"I know you said closest to, I just wonder what else they would have to do to pass your RPG litmus test."
"Second this- plus its in my neighborhood, great people"
"Cobra Kai is super good, season 1 and 2 just released on Netflix season 3 on the way."
"So, is that considered ""natural?""

I've always wondered...."
"All I can tell you is that seven years ago tomorrow- ha, wow- my husband and I took our honeymoon vacation to Sandals Whitehouse resort in Jamaica. 

All-inclusive, couples only, great food, beach fun, everything you could hope for.

10/10 would honeymoon there again!"
I‚Äôm a big fan of VOSS. I like the water and I like the bottles they come in
"A longsword. I have a collection of other weapons, some fantasy based, but mostly katanas. I‚Äôve not been able to find a more historically based longsword I‚Äôm actually happy with. It‚Äôs only really gaudy looking ‚ÄúTemplar‚Äù sword and stuff. Of course, I haven‚Äôt really looked very hard yet."
Rhino shield by evolutive labs.
it seems best course of action is to just ignore them completely and hope they continue their mass mailing campaign and forget about you.
It sounds like your bf could use a healthy dose of grow the fuck up.
"I work for a big hotel chain and I have got to say, this is the impression we try to leave on all of our guests"
"I think I'd keep with my mechanical engineering major, but I would take some more management and business classes. I minored in philosophy, which I'd keep, but there were a few bs classes sprinkled in that would have done me more good if they were more finance related."
NFS UG2 too! Loved my full maxed Golf GTI
