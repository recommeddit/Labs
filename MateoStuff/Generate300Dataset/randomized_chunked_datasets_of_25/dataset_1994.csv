Can someone summarize how this conclusion was reached?"
56784,best desktop monitor,"250 budget? 

How about a 29"" LG ultrawide? Ther is a 25"" one, and while some people find it small, it suits my desk size perfectly and I find it amazing over 16:9 monitors."
67762,axios alternatives reddit,"It is fine, until it isn't and then you got a big problem cutting it out. 

It is a bit naive and based on assumption there is only one API and you'd never need to get stuff from another that might return 401 but is not related to your user stuff. Just don't do it."
42826,best detective show,"Japan loves crime/mystery/cop dramas and there's usually several to choose from every season.  Here are just a few examples (that don't include romance).  

 - Keiji Yugami - excellent cop series but has some ""drama"" in the sense that the relationship between the two cops is important to the story.  No romance though.  
 - Shinzanmono - A slightly weird, loner cop arrives in a new neighborhood to uncover the ""truth"" behind certain crimes.  
 - SP (Security Police) - Lots of action/combat. Mystery drama about a policeman working security detail with an unusual sixth sense type of ability solving the mystery behind a terrorist like organization.  
 - Kurokochi - A serial drama telling a fictionalized story about solving the (real life) unsolved 1968, 300 Million Yen robbery.
 - Joker Yurusarezaru Sosakan  
 - Strawberry Night (the original with Takeuchi Yuko, not the remake with Nikaido Fumi)   
 - Sniffer - Man with super smelling abilities solves crimes.  
 - Lucky Seven - A not-as-serious in tone detective series.  High budget, all star cast though.  
 - Smoking Gun - Like Lucky Seven, not as serious in tone
 - Kagi no Kakatta Heya - A light, mystery of the week show about sealed room murders.   
 - Nazotoki wa Dinner no Ato de - a very light, comedy mystery so maybe not what you're looking for.  
 - Unfair - A loner female cop chasing a serial murderer.  

If you don't mind long running episodic dramas (eg: CSI, Law and Order etc) then Aibou is a long running (currently on season 18 or so) and very popular drama with no romance.  It's the best quality of this type and features several specials every season and has also spawned several movies.  

Keiji 7-nin is another one of the better long running (currently season 7) episodic cop dramas. 

There are also several similar dramas that aren't operating at the same budget level as Aibou but none the less do well in the ratings like Kasouken no Onna (currently on season 19)."

Bottled water is all the same and a huge waste of resources. Environmental catastrophe."
31783,best hotel to live in,"I vowed off exercise a few years ago.  After thinking about it, it seems like an enormous waste of time just to try and look a little bit better in someones eyes.  Now, I understand the health reasons and some people need to do it, but the average person needs a 20-30min walk a day and to eat healthy.  So that's what I do.  I walk a lot at work and eat healthy.  Seems fine and I stopped feeling guilty for not going to a gym."

I showed him and afterwards I asked, “are you an actor sir?” He paused and looked at me with a friendly smirk and said “Sometimes “. I smiled and nodded. I decided to roll with it and dropped the subject. He seemed to appreciate it and approached me again with another produce question a couple of weeks later. Seemed like a good dude with a pleasant vibe."
