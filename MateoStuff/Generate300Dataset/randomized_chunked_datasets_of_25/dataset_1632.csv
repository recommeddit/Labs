52116,best iphone case,"I have tried a few but the best for me is the [clear Urban Armour Gear (UAG)](http://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-iPhone-Display/dp/B00LCAVRLS). For additional protection I also suggest the [Tech Armor Ballistic Screen Protector](http://www.amazon.com/Ballistic-Protector-Tech-Armor-Premium/dp/B00EL94RQE).

The UAG is stiff enough that I think it helps to reduce the chances of the iPhone getting bent. The UAG, especially the clear version, is not bulky but the lip is high enough to reduce the chances of damage to the screen when the phone is dropped accidentally. Word of caution though is you have to be careful when removing it as it is a tight fit."

14896,best romantic novel,"This is really cool, thanks for creating it! 

That being said, I really don't understand why people like The Hating Game. I read it after seeing it recommended so many places, and it was so bad I'm not even adding it to my Goodreads. 

Courtney Milan's Cyclone series on the other hand... Books usually end with me just sitting on my couch clutching a tea and bawling. They're just so human. Can't believe they didn't make the list!"

I just asked her what she recommends and she said ""Anything with flouride, everything else is just bullshit companies are using to get you to buy it. Toothpaste is toothpaste"" Thanks mum :)"
