69941,"Good engineering programs will have a gen-ed type intro to engineering class you should take in your first two semesters.  It should give you a chance to try out different types of engineering.  


I would recommend talking to professors that teach the higher level classes.  Let them know you are interested and see what they think about things that interest you.  i.e. job prospects, job security, grad school requirements for positions you want, pre-requisites for upper level classes, possible minors that wouldn't require a large extra load of classes, co-op positions, etc.  


Then if you still have the time, try to network with some actual practicing engineers in the fields you are interested in.  Go to some job fairs your first semester, even if you aren't graduating anytime soon and just go check out the prospective companies and talk to them.  Get a connection that could give you an in for a co-op in your second or third year.  Those damn things are worth their weight in gold when you get out.

Good luck!  It's a fun ride, but do your homework.",best major to study in college
