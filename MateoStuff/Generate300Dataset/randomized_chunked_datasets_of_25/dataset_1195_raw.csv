"5600x! Higer single core performance and over core performance. Well u wanna get out of the debate? Watch videos from the holy grail, gamer nexus and all. Amd is really doing a good job with their cpus.

U will see YouTube is full of build videos all surrounding 5600x. Watch pc centric, he builds almost every rtx 3000 series around the 5600x. I mean why re invent the wheel? Why fix if it ain't broken? There must be a reason most youtubers who are into building go for the ryzen 5 5600x!

If u can find a good price, can evem go for a ryzen 7 5800x. I did, myself."

It will keep your mouth basic for a long time though. Brush with it before bed, lightly.

Tooth Enamel has a mohs hardness of 5. Baking soda has a mohs hardness of 3. Its also water soluble."

"Open = sex is on page. Described and could be at different levels of explicit-ness. 

Closed = fade to black or mentioned that sex has happened, but it happens off the page. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any ones where sex doesn‚Äôt occur at all and I typically would label those as chaste, but chaste books could fall under a ‚Äúclosed door‚Äù book."
"The transfer entry is so usefel with how I want the app to work for me. I now have complete visbility of my money down to a peso. What I do at the end of the day, I transfer coins from my cash account to a piggy coin bank. I like my money without ""butal"". I am a self diagnosed OC person that is also a minimalist with everything, but I found the app to be just enough for me. But haven't tried too many apps out there. I wanted to just master one and stick with it and so far it has made me handle my finances smartly."
"But if I am not mistaken those 3 distros I mentioned , support more apps."
"Yes, Raiden is in striking distance of shidenkais speed and very comfortable. I do have to point out, I've had one spinout, but for the amount of time I've used it I think that's appropriate.
