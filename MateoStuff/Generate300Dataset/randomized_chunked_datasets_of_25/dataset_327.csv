55640,best action and adventure novel series,"I know that many disagree, but the other two in the Takeshi Kovacks series were similarly action packed, if not quite as all-around great as Altered Carbon."

31971,best hotel to live in,"Hyatt offers cat 1-4 every year.  Hilton offers gold status with its card (free internet, free breakfast for 2, room upgrades etc.  Everyone always underestimates the breakfast benefit, in many places they're full breakfast buffets or restaurants, saving you probably at least 30-50 dollars each morning) whereas Hyatt offers lower tier status.  Hilton Reserve offers any weekend night (Fri, Sat, Sun) if you spend 10k on its card.  The coupon expires within 1 year.  If you sign up now, they're running a $100 statement credit, making the first year freeish.

Hyatt only has about 500 hotels to IHG, Marriott or Hilton's 5000 each though, so if you want a hotel that's almost everywhere, pick one of those.  IHG, Marriott also offer free nights, though IHG is on any hotel and Marriott is cat. 1-5, though Marriott has significantly less hotels in 1-5 range than Hyatt does with 1-4."

I agree."
32707,best vacation resort,"My husband and I have gone to Sandals Whitehouse (Jamaica) and Secrets Maroma (Mexico). If you're looking for a week to relax, all-inclusive is the way to go. If you're looking for adventure, it's probably not the route to take. I also think that it is well worth the money because of all of the inclusions. There's a lot to do on the resorts and we found the food/drinks to be excellent. We spent approximately 4,000 for each of these trips including flight. Here are links to two reviews I posted on tripadvisor for more info: http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1009314-d499965-r98093271-Sandals_Whitehouse_European_Village_and_Spa-Whitehouse_Westmoreland_Parish_Jamaica.html and http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1007582-r115699879-Secrets_Maroma_Beach_Riviera_Cancun-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html

59858,best perfume,"Jo Malone wood sage and sea salt. It was my wedding perfume, and it's one of my favourite scents hands down. I wish it would last a bit longer, but I've never smelled anything like it. 

Another I like is Chanel chance. This one is nostalgic for me, and just reminds me of holidays, and special events. It's much stronger than the Jo Malone one, so it's not an everyday scent for me, and I use it sparingly. It's the kind of perfume you'll still smell on your wrists or clothes the next day.

Viktor and Rolf flowerbomb is another favourite. It's floral and vanilla-y, but with just enough musk to make it really sophisticated and sexy. Very addicting smell!

Last one I promise, Giorgio Armani Si. I can't put my finger on what this smells like...it's floral, but sweet, but not in a candy way. Maybe a tiny bit of citrus? It's just such an unusual scent, super interesting."
68832,best science fiction novel,"but it was science, it was magic(or hallucinations)"
73304,best Linux distro,"Mint is easy, debian is stable and ubuntu is ubiquitous."
38160,best Marvel movie,"Just replying to throw some support behind this take. *Infinity War* is an extended best of showreel with no substance. I like *Endgame*, which actually dares to be fun and somewhat meaningful."
11104,best backpack for college,"But, they fix them for free, for ever!  Plus, I have had mine since 5 th grade.  I'm 30 now."
32346,best hotel to live in,"I worked in security for one and housekeeping called us all the time for drugs they’d find in a room. The first thing we’d ask for is the room number and we’d look up the name of the guest. If it was a VIP or someone important to us we’d tell them to leave it there and “we’d take care of it.” 

If the guest was someone we didn’t know and not important to us we’d go up there and take it out of the room, then threaten to evict them from their stay if they did it again.

The clues/hints we would use:
-what’s their status tier? Diamond members almost always got a pass 
-how did they book the room? If it was a 3rd party like Expedia…no pass
-how many times had they stayed at our specific property? 5 or more…pass
-how much had they charged up? If they were spending money on property outside of the room rate…pass

Basically you could have cocaine in your room if you spent enough money."
35143,best NFL player,"Not gonna lie in my mind he's getting 12 but I just don't know whom he's replacing. Maybe Kelce/Tyreek since they might reduce each other's votes. I'd love seeing Garrett in the top 10 tho, love me some more defenders."
54805,best water filter,"I use eSpring from Amway (yes, the MLM company). I think it's $900 to buy the unit and it comes with a filter that lasts about one year of daily use for a family. Replacement filters are $200 or so. The beauty of it is that it's not just a filter, but also passes the water by a UV light to actively kill pathogens. It keeps the fluoride in the water, though (if that's a concern to you)."
58825,best cologne,"Scents are very personal. It's all about what you feel is right for you. Definitely should go to a large store like Macy's and test some out. I'm sure there's someone who could help you. 

Personally, I prefer chrome azzaro for spring and summer. It smells like the beach to me. Just really fresh and oceany. For fall and winter I usually choose a more earthy scent. That's just me though. Find something that you like."

Here's a link to the 256 GB SSD version, which is within budget. Great battery life, low weight, and can handle lighter games."
54174,best medicine for a cold,"Re: zinc .... this is a bit controversial.  Zinc has been studied in viral infection, in humans mostly related to diarrheal illness and most commonly in third world settings ... so not in your average over-fed westerner.  It seems that zinc supplementation during diarrhea in previously malnourished kids may have some benefit.  Evidence of that in kids that aren't well nourished is hard to find.  Good studies in upper repiratory tract infections is also hard to find.  Zinc overdoses can happen ... so .... no idea if it works or not.  Don't use them myself."
