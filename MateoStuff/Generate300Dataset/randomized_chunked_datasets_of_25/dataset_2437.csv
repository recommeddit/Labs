70553,best major to study in college,"I'm an engineer and business owner. We do a fair bit of science and math. There's a reason math-heavy careers tend to command $100k+ salaries once you're established in the field. If you're not skilled enough to handle complex math, that kind of limits your options, and when you want to know which career gives you the best opportunity to get a higher salary... well... that's probably the one you'd want.

Don't panic, though. You can still earn over $100k per year in other ways. In terms of lowest barrier to entry, being a really good salesman can drive your total compensation into six figures; this works across multiple fields, too, so you can pick what you are good at selling (houses, swimming pools, kids toys, etc.). Most attorneys have decent earnings, but they do require additional schooling and passing the Bar. Medical school is difficult and expensive, but it's another path. Perhaps the best way to earn $100k+ annually without a degree is to invest about $2.5m in a diversified portfolio; but, you'd need that amount of liquid assets first."

49043,best gaming monitor,"I’ve had the Asus 27” iPS 144hz 1440p that everybody sweared by and it doesn’t compare to the LG model the exact same one you are considering is the one I switched to and I won’t ever go back! It’s quite literally a dream monitor! Colors, Blacks, refresh rate, response time, everything is 10/10 A-1 sauce! Even though it’s a little expensive it’s got such a nice picture quality that I may consider changing all my TVs and monitors in the house to LG."

29657,best game console,"It is worth noting that the PS2 version of Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 is almost completely different from the Gamecube, Xbox, and PC versions because the latter was made by one studio while the former was made by EA Black Box.  It looks much, much prettier and is overall more fun, but runs at a lower framerate.  Sound familiar?  Recommend checking it out if you've played the others.

Also, the Xbox version has bloom whereas the PC version does not."

23926,best anime,"We have similar tastes! I do think the Kara no Kyoukai series deserves some more love. I still have the Monogatari series over it though. I'm curious, have you watched Monogatari? I'm going to check out Shinsekai Yori because of your list"

52088,best iphone case,"It sounds like it might have actually been defective. I'm in seattle, where cases tend to get damp sometimes, and i know several people who have them(albeit the 5s version). Even people who have had them for pretty much a year at this point the leather itself might be worn/stained/""have a patina"" but the integrity of the case is fine. Maybe that one had a shitty glue job? that's just weird to me."

>(Tries a bit) yeah that is rancid. I can feel my tongue going numb

>(Eats more) that taste is metallic and disgusting. I can't eat anymore

> (Finishing the rest) that was definitely bad

Steve loves those things. He's like the Bob Ross of MREs and it's perfect. His enthusiasm is contagious and I hope he never changes (when it comes to MREs at least)"
28843,best breakfast foods,"I second over night oats! I hate most hot oatmeals, but love overnight oats and I spend about 10 dollars on ingredients every three weeks or so!

My recipe is a little different, because I don't like it too runny!

1/3 cup oats
1/3 cup vanilla greek yogurt (I use Dannon light and fit)
1/3 unsweetened vanilla almond milk
A sprinkle of cinnamon
And a sprinkle of whatever dried fruit sounds good (apples or blueberries are what I like best)

Then I mix it all together, let it sit over night and top it with 1/4 cup of granola. 

It's around 300 calories and keeps me full until lunch!"
