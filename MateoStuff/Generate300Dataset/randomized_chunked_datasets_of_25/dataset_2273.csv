55409,"I saw this comment and decided to read the book it promotes. let me just say, despite the first 20% of the novel being rather slow (ad at times disjointed) exposition, I'm 50% through and it has been nothing less than an exquisite read so far.",best action and adventure novel series
5709,"So here's how you go about it: you need a portfolio, and you'll build it in steps. 

* Step 1) make a few free websites / webapps / mobile-apps. Build a promotional site for one of your friend's / family's businesses (eg, their photography website, etc). If you or a friend have had this ""killer app idea"", crank it out in Ionic. And of course, #3 is your actual portfolio website itself: `{yourname_or_businessname}.com`. Step 1 should take ~1mo.
* Step 2) make a few _cheap_ sites/apps. Now you have something to prove your worth, time to test the water. Do this at [oDesk/upWork](https://www.upwork.com), [Elance](https://www.elance.com/), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com), [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com), etc. These are websites for finding global talent. As such, you're competing with devs willing to work for $5/h. It's a career non-option for westerners, but it's a great place to start practicing with clients. These sites' customers kinda _expect_ to get what they pay for - trust me, I've hired from these sites, and have friends who did too. ""The work was sub-par, but hey - can't beat the price!"" In other words, you won't feel your career / reputation on the line quite as much in these ""practice grounds."" I'm sure I'm making legitimate bid-site users cringe, but that's how I've used these sites. Step 2 should take ~1-2mo.
* Step 3) Now you have 4-6 portfolio pieces, you're in! The best way to get a solid gig is in person or through connections. Go to [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/] (search ""javascript"", ""angular"", etc) and present / network. Ask your friends / social networks if anyone's looking for talent. Now, this is a slower process than hunting online, but it yields higher-paying gigs, better clients, and overall more rewarding work - ask anyone. _While_ you're doing this (in the background) start searching online, but remembering that in-person/connection gigs are usually better, if you're presented with one of both ;) Ok, online. My favorite sites are the following:
  * W2: as in careers, part-time/full-time, on-site _jobs_: [indeed](http://www.indeed.com/), [simplyhired](http://www.simplyhired.com/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/), [hired](https://hired.com), [TopTal](https://www.toptal.com/). **Ignore this section**, since you're looking for freelance.
  * 1099: as in freelancing, remote, one-off gigs. My favorites: [gunio](https://gun.io/dash/), [remoteok](http://remoteok.io/), [peopleperhour](http://www.peopleperhour.com/). RemoteOK aggregates many good gig boards, so I've excluded _those_. Any other boards someone would recommend? Also, google search jobs in your chosen technology, eg ""angular jobs"" or ""react jobs"". Some more I haven't investigated: [awesomeweb](https://www.awesomeweb.com/), [whitetruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com/), ~~/r/forhire ([nevermind](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/3c9sep/does_anyone_find_work_on_rforhire/))~~",best programming language for web development

27696,"Shahrukh Khan. My childhood is intrinsically linked with him. My parents tell me that I used to sleep-dance when Aisi Deewangi used to come on TV. I remember watching DTPH as a kid in the theatre and trying to convince my bemused family that I want a love marriage in the future because ""someone somewhere was made for me"". I rebelled when they refused to change my name to Rahul (they convinced me to keep my present name by reminding me that my real name is actually one that SRK had in another movie). Whenever I'm down, I hark back to his old stuff and all the happiest memories just come rushing back. Oh and if you don't believe that ""pyaar dosti hai.."", please, be married for a couple of years and wait for the romance to die down. At the end, love really boils down to the depth of the personal connection you have with your partner


It's an emotional, irrational choice, but I love that man. His (possibly fabricated) backstory, his persona, his general opinions, his charm and wit during interviews... And of course loads of his movies. Of course, he's done some bizarre films in the past few years story-wise, but


After all these years?
