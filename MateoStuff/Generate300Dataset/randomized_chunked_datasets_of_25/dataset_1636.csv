2618,"I would say around $50-80 for IEMs, and $100-200 for headphones. Though certaintly not the best, the vsd5s can be had for $69, and the Sennheiser HD598 is for $150 on amazon (same price as my AKG612pros), so I would say thats a pretty good setup. 

For headphones the massdrop K7XXX is a steal at $200, and though certainty not 'endgame', is pretty far up there. I A/B'ed my AKG612 with an HD800 and while the latter is much more resolving and clear, the difference isnt worth the $1000+ premium (and I was using a Sennheiser HDVD800!)",best headphones

My wife on the other hand, she likes wearing Ray Bans because they're Ray Bans. So we have several pairs of Ray Bans around the house. And she'll continue buying Ray Bans, much to my chagrin..",best sunglasses for fashion

You could do anything from programming an automated assembly line, sitting on a computer designing, being out on a factory floor troubleshooting a problem, basically anything...
