2618,best headphones,"I would say around $50-80 for IEMs, and $100-200 for headphones. Though certaintly not the best, the vsd5s can be had for $69, and the Sennheiser HD598 is for $150 on amazon (same price as my AKG612pros), so I would say thats a pretty good setup. 

For headphones the massdrop K7XXX is a steal at $200, and though certainty not 'endgame', is pretty far up there. I A/B'ed my AKG612 with an HD800 and while the latter is much more resolving and clear, the difference isnt worth the $1000+ premium (and I was using a Sennheiser HDVD800!)"

66688,best soccer team in the world,what makes it all funnier is your current squad is probably stronger than the 2016 one too. So you guys won a major title with probably your weakest team in the 21st century.

41784,movies like Inception,Feel that. Plus you can watch cube zero without having to watch the second one which is cool.
16081,best sunglasses for fashion,"From what I can tell, the quality hasn't seemed to suffer. The build of my newer pair feels solid and the optics seem the same. That said, their poly lens optics are very good, but their glass lenses are incredible. Overall, I can't see myself buying any other brand at this point.

My wife on the other hand, she likes wearing Ray Bans because they're Ray Bans. So we have several pairs of Ray Bans around the house. And she'll continue buying Ray Bans, much to my chagrin.."

12300,best gifts for dad,I genuinely wish I'd put a lot more effort into fathers day. My dad died a couple of year ago when I was 24. I'm now a dad myself I have a 1 year old. A gift doesn't have to be expensive or even physical. Time is free so use as much of it as you can. My dad died at 48 which is no age at all.
19437,best YouTube video,Dead Meat. Even if you’re not a horror movie fan. They’re funny and solid reviews so I get to be informed and not have to sit through a 90 minute movie.

32580,best vacation resort,Just got back from a beautiful spot near Tulum a few months ago. Very safe and we had a great time! The resort even sets up a market place on site to support local businesses :)
33187,best electric car,"Turo! It's not free, it was so much better to test for 3 days instead of 30 minutes."
69863,best major to study in college,"There are tons of job opportunities for Mechanicals specifically.  It's the broadest field of engineering.  You could do anything from programming an automated assembly line, sitting on a computer designing, being out on a factory floor troubleshooting a problem, basically anything...  I just graduated last week from Missouri S&T, it is VERY uncommon for a Mechanical to graduate without a job lined up.  I highly recommend it."
29731,best money managing app,"I just always import.  It's especially annoying at the end of the month when I want to sort everything out and assign leftovers to savings but they're not in yet, but usually I wait because 5% of the time either I enter it wrong or the charge comes in a way that doesn't link correctly, like when Amazon splits up charges by shipping unit."
51921,best iphone case,"Not the other person but for me I have always liked the leather cases. They are slim especially the Apple variety and I like the patina they get over time. They will be insanely bright at first but will naturally get darker over time.

I went with the blue years ago and it is essentially almost black at this point. It’s also falling apart but it’s like I think like 5 years old at this point.

There are people who speed up the process to get the aged look right out of the box."
19936,best workout music,... There must be an error here.  I don't see [Macho Man by The Village People](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO43p2Wqc08) on the list.  Definitely an error somewhere.
