30571,"This is the exact explanation I got. I was under the impression that Japan wanted to do some empire building in their neck of the woods, but were afraid that if they were to get bogged down in fighting in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya the Americans would come across the Pacific and either attack Japan itself or make supplying the forward deployed forces impossible. They planned to destroy our Pacific presence in one fell swoop, make their land grabs in Asia, and be back to defend their flank before we could re-mobilize.",best Mexican war to study

34304,"> In what world do you lead the league in picks (10) and you aren't even in the top 50 PFF players?

In a world where this list is the 50 best players in the NFL for **2021**. From the introduction:

> [""The ranking below is a projection of what we think will happen and not necessarily a reaction to a spectacular or underwhelming 2020 season.""](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-pff50-ranking-50-best-players-nfl-2021)

PFF already released a list of the top players for the 2020 season only and Howard was 26th. But for this list, they're considering past performance as well as projecting for this year, so leaving Howard (who isn't young and doesn't have a spotless record of performance with 2 good years and 3 meh ones) off seems fine to me.",best NFL player

New Zealand, Canada or Australia aren't so bad, although every other animal tries to kill you down under.",best country to live in
