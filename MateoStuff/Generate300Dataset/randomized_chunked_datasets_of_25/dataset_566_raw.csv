"This is a great list! Very happy to see Evangelion, Bebop and Madoka at the top."
"Learning how to make and exploit personal contacts is the most important thing you can learn in college. 
Join a frat. Exploit the alumni. 
Keep in touch with well placed friends. Exploit them. 
Kiss up to your well connected professors. USE THEM.
It's how the real world works."
I remember it being taught in away that clearly showed we were the aggressors. Outside of that i don't remember
Ooh will try it out.
"Any writing utensil will do for quick sketches on the go as I don't like carrying a pencil pouch and stick to a mechanical pencil and sketch pad.
When I actually have a piece I wish to refine or actually work on then any art pencil works. Led is led and charcoal is charcoal. I just go to Hobby Lobby and grab a small variety set of 9H to 9B that they have. I also buy a smaller black leather bound sketch pad (for my on the go) and a more larger/normal one."
"Def one of the Chi 5 dorms if you want to have more chances interacting with other people. It all depends on how social you want to be. But Chi 5 dorms provide that the best. The least chance would be manzi and san raf as they are mostly occupied by 2nd years. But then again, RAs hold events and stuff there too so if you want to meet new people, you still have a chance."
"Then I shall have to say Scientifik aswell (r.i.p)   
Criminal is THE most underrated hip hop album ever for me"

"I'm crying right now, I would be peeved!"
"[Actually you do need an invite. ](https://www.myanonamouse.net/inviteapp.php)

>Unfortunately, if you are reading this, MyAnonamouse has become a victim of its own success. We have so many fantastic members, that we have had to close our doors to everyone without an invite.

You currently have to go through their IRC server during specific 25 hour time slots only on Wednesday or Saturday to get an invite."
I wish I would have pursued the STEM to MBA program at my university. I am currently pursuing a degree in civil engineering but wish I would have known about the accelerated MBA program sooner. Now it is too late. I would much rather do technical sales and the business side of things than design/field work.
Also a huge fan of the Magpie Lord series.
It can’t possibly be the fact that it’s been out for 4 days.
I have hiked the Sleeping Bear Dunes every year since I was 10. It never ceases to amaze me with its beauty.

"> cannot legally distribute them widely

My favorite part of writing my thesis was needing to get permission from journals to use *my own papers*. One journal has it written explicitly that you only need to copy the agreement, the other 2 I had to email asking them to use my own words. Then I  had to thank each journal for that permission....felt awful."
POKI!
This guy like bourbon? Plenty of good bottles to be had for less than $50.
"I just teared up a little. Right now I'm a combination ""that's my *mom*"" in that tone and ""ugh *mahm*!!""

I can't wait to just be mom again."
"It does have a very high skill ceiling as well. However, yes, a lot of the difficulty with being a professional pianist is that merely being a good pianist doesn't mean you'll get work. Hell, being a great pianist doesn't necessarily mean you'll get work."
exurb1a is a really nice channel to watch. he offers tons of insights into the human experience while still remaining funny.
