"HD does all the same, military discounts, electronic receipts, etc....Lowe’s is less than a mile from me, HD/Menards are side by side 6-8 miles away.  I started going to HD/Menards last year because Lowe’s screwed up soooo bad with appliances.  I ordered an ‘in stock’ washer the first week of November.  It finally got fully delivered the 1st week of February."
Wow. You seem like a real high achiever...
I got bored and bought a bass guitar once for $89.

ha i always go into these threads to make sure the rightful ruler is in place
FYI he took over direction very early and not in second half
I had a fantastic honeymoon at a Sandals as well. It was the best service and adults only. It was quiet at night though. Not too much entertainment. But we didn't mind as it was our honeymoon. We stayed at the Sandals La Toc in Saint Lucia.
"Well this is deeply fascinating. I would love to see this in an interactive format on the Web (and indeed the /r/cricket sidebar once it's been thoroughly QA'd). Any chance on posting the algorithm, or is it something you'd like to keep to yourself for now?"

"I dont wear colognes, i just apply a good aftershave after...i shave. 

My current favourite is Ogallala Bay rum. It makes my skin soft and sexy, repairs it and moisturises it as well as adding a pleasing, subtle sent."
