If all you need is to remove the taste of chlorine, try an undersink filter from the hardware store. Just buy the cheapest one. Check the price of new cartridges and divide by the duration in gallons or months. You may find that the limiting factor is the six month replacement schedule and not the number of gallons passed through it.",best water filter

Honourable mentions that I love a lot (this was hard):

- Tokyo Sinks 2020 (Very much loved this even though it gets a lot of hate)
- 91 days
- Erased
- Fairy tail
- A silent voice 
- One Punch man
- Tokyo Ghoul 
- Toradora 
- Violet Evergarden 
- Space Dandy

These are all anime I have finished and love alot. A silent Voice would be in the top 10 however, I wanted to keep it to 1 movie.

Anime I'm watching and would put into the top 10 as it stands:

- Wonder Egg priority  (could be one of my favourite of all time)
- Jujutsu kasien 

Any anime people can recommend for me to watch on what you'd feel I like?

69352,"In the end, it only matters how heavily your school is recruited in regards to your major.  I'm majoring in accounting and went the CC -> state school route.  I'm enrolled at the #2 state school for my state, which is only a top 30 iirc.  I get offers from the same firms kids from top tier schools get.  In fact, I just signed a contract for an internship with a B4 firm and some of the kids who will be interning with me are from Ivy Leagues.  

Now, if I was going finance, this wouldn't be the case.  IB and the lot specifically pic from top tier schools.  Finance is an extremely difficult major when it comes to recruiting.  It seems you either go IB or bust your ass doing something else for little (compared to acg/CS/eng/SD) pay.

You are also 100% correct about networking.  The kids going to the big firms either know someone on the inside or they went to all the recruiting events and got to know everyone there.  Those are the people getting offers.  Take the time to do it, get the free food/drinks, meet your potential coworkers, and soak it all in.  The school will not ""put you in to jobs"".  You do that yourself.  They simply provide the floor for you to meet recruiters.  That is 100% it.  I wish more people would realize that you need to hunt DURING school to find a job.  It won't magically drop in your lap after you graduate with a piece of paper.

Just Google the majors you're interested in, what the work involves, how recruiting goes, etc. and make a move.  You still have a while to decide.",best major to study in college
