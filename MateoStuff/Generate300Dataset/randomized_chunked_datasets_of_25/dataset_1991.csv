We ruled out the Universal Studios because we all are not that into movies and we think Disney land is too expensive and we'd rather see some more of LA while we are here.

68330,"Read all of Frank's book (the first 6) and burn all of Brian's. Frank Herbert's series was epic. Admittedly, many questions were left unanswered, as he died before he could wrap things up. Brian's works could be used for toilet paper and I still think it'd be a waste. Rarely have I put a book down before finishing it; it took me just a few chapters to determine that whatever story was behind it, it wasn't worth fighting through the writing style that Brian and Kevin J Anderson displayed.",best science fiction novel

This last Monday I walked in a game store and found one with new internal parts that works.  I grabbed it, an extra controller, and a mario cartridge.

10622,"Travel insurance can be finicky when it comes to lost or stolen luggage in transit. They would rather the airline or airport paid, and the airline or airport would rather the insurance company paid. So you can end up in the middle of a dispute about who is liable.

Also, if you're carrying anything remotely valuable, the limits on travel insurance for luggage are often too low, so you'll want supplementary insurance for those items.",best suitcase lock

14661,"Well, ""publish"" is a tricky word right now because there's SO MUCH romance being self-published, and I think most of my experience with absolutely terrible stuff is from self-published authors. There are some publishers/ imprints that (in my opinion) don't really care about how well a book is written, and for which the editing standards are rather lax. If a publisher offers some sort of club where you receive 3 romance novels a month, they're probably focusing more on quantity than quality. Some even have really specific requirements for their authors, which further constrains creativity and enforces uniformity. I usually have good luck with Avon books, and the opposite with Harlequin, but I can't say for certain that that's a rule and not just luck of the draw.

Also, re self-publishing, there are some good authors who eschew publishing houses and don't suffer for it. I *think* Courtney Milan is a good example of this, though I'm not positive that she's independent.",best romantic novel
