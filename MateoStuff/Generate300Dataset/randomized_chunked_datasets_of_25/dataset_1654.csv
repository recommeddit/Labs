62491,Best RPG game on PS4,"I think I snookered myself, ended up in a place where I needed some oil for my sword, didn’t have it, or the money to get it. Have you ever found yourself in a position like that on it?"
61971,Best RPG game on PS4,Just sunk 110 hours into Dragon Age Inquisition and have not finished the base game yet but I'm a side quester. I loved the Witcher 3 and heard it ruined DA:I but I have really enjoyed it.
58079,best cologne,"Hahaha that is a pretty clever move! And I completely agree man, Dylan blue is definitely a fantastic scent... Versatile, fresh and clean and the longevity is great too! Glad you enjoy it!"

67379,axios alternatives reddit,"This is why you don't jump on hype.

I had considered migrating from `node-fetch` but I didn't like the feel of axios code. It felt more verbose and at the same time, not as obvious what actually happened inside of its internals."
58035,best cologne,"Wow I did not expect my cologne to be the top comment. I thought it was my secret smell lol. 

I use the ultime version for the last 4 years, and i love it still. My other one is lacoste white"
60201,best freezer brand,"Many of their appliances, including many of their refrigerators, are still built in the US including in Louisville, KY. They also still do much of the engineering there. The same people that designed and built their appliances before the company changed hands still do."

23651,best car racing video game,NFS Heat has pretty great progression system and the best car customization in the AAA space
73842,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I say just get a silicon pencil cover.

I have a matte screen protector but based on my testing, the silicon pencil nib cover can be an alternative to a matte screen protector if writing feel is what you're after."
2468,best headphones,"I like Bose. Good response, clear sound, and a noise canceling system that can kill most any annoying sound. Expensive though. 

Sony makes a really nice headphone, I had NC7s and NC8s for a while, and some headphones I liked but forgot the model number of. As I'm typing this, I'm using some MDR-ZX110NCs. No complaints.

Beats are overpriced, overrated, and anything else can most likely outperform it.

When I used to volunteer as a sound designer, we had a set of some Audio Technicas that I never had any problems with, whether I was running mic check or just using 100k worth of audio equipment to play Blink-182.

 But seriously, a good set of Sony headphones will serve you well for audiophile use. Audio engineering, see this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6sjh0r/audiophiles_of_reddit_what_headphones_would_you/dld9hbt/

I'n almost sure that's what we used, and they worked amazingly."

3402,best webcamera,"I have my set up sourced from a laptop, and I use my default laptop webcam and honestly, for some shits and giggles, it's not a bad way to 'start'. It's a dream to actually get into streaming, but I'm echoing OP here, starting cheap and small is definitely the way to go, rather than investing in something you may not develop commitment for."
64725,Best Nike running shoes,"On the other hand Nike get bad rap on running forums like reddit because someone went to a running shoe store and the salesperson told them that ""real"" runners don't wear Nikes, they wear \[fill in the brand that store sells the most of\]."

47977,best color to paint with,I like the idea of a darker grey in a baby’s room. I think I read that in infancy they may only see black and white. They need that high contrast. I have seen many do and black and white checker board with very intense colors which I love. And babies see it better.
