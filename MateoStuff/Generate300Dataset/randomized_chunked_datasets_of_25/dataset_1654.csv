2468,"I like Bose. Good response, clear sound, and a noise canceling system that can kill most any annoying sound. Expensive though. 

Sony makes a really nice headphone, I had NC7s and NC8s for a while, and some headphones I liked but forgot the model number of. As I'm typing this, I'm using some MDR-ZX110NCs. No complaints.

Beats are overpriced, overrated, and anything else can most likely outperform it.

When I used to volunteer as a sound designer, we had a set of some Audio Technicas that I never had any problems with, whether I was running mic check or just using 100k worth of audio equipment to play Blink-182.

 But seriously, a good set of Sony headphones will serve you well for audiophile use. Audio engineering, see this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6sjh0r/audiophiles_of_reddit_what_headphones_would_you/dld9hbt/
