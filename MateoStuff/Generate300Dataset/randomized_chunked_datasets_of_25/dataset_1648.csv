51313,best iphone case,I was also gonna get pink silicone but I ended up ordering the OtterBox Figura Case (the second  one in that link) I may have to pick that cloud one up though! It looks amazing I’m just always worried about third party clear cases yellowing pretty quickly
11464,best gifts for dad,"If you husband has never had custom boot you can probably get buy doing this game/keepsake even better if you have kids. Make a foot memories gift for Grandparents. Photocopy his foot and a custom boot can be made close to those dimensions. If he wears half mid calf they will probably want other dimensions, but an idea to at least get you started."

36959,best roller coaster at six flags,"From my least favorite to my favorite.

SFA - Only worth it to get the credits. I'll probably return when they RMC Roar.

SFNE - Good ride collection, horrible operations. When I was there (last time was Goliath's opening year I think), they were assigning seats on rides that had no lines. Will probably revisit at some point for Wicked Cyclone and to ride Superman again.

SFGAm - Large collection of rides, has the original Batman, Raging Bull is good, and Goliath is pretty good. Nothing really makes my top 10 steel though. Goliath comes in at number 7 wood for me which, despite being a weaker RMC, is still an RMC.

SFOG - This is a great little park with a quirky layout but very good ride collection. Scorcher is my favorite Stand-up, they have the best Batman (in my opinion). Dare Devil Dive is really underrated. Goliath and Mindbender are both amazing. The one drawback is that the wooden coasters are horribly rough. Both Cyclone and Scream Machine come in at the bottom of the 48 wooden coasters I've ridden. If they get retracked or RMCd, I'd be glad to go back down to experience the park again.

SFMM - This is a destination park. Sure, the coasters could be considered weaker than most, but the park it has a lot of coasters that are definitely in the top half of my rankings. The highlights here are Superman, the first coaster to reach 100 MPH, Tatsu, the most intense and probably best American flyer, and of course X2, which is my number 3 steel and has an experience that can't be described. Last time I was there was 2013, so I haven't experienced Twisted Colossus yet, and I've heard that it's really good as well.

SFGAdv - This and SFMM are really close for me but it really comes down to the fact that I visit SFGAdv more than any other Six Flags park because of how close it is to me. It has a pretty good line-up that has 3 half-decent B&Ms (Green Lantern, Superman and Batman), 2 really good B&M's (Nitro and Bizarro), two really good indoor family coasters (Dark Knight and Skull Mountain), a Vekoma Madhouse (Houdini is amazing), the tallest coaster in the fucking world (Kingda Ka), and one of the absolute best wooden coasters in the world (El Toro). The collection is amazing and makes up for the park's terrible layout. Seriously, El Toro is worth the trip there alone, and when you combine that with the rest of their lineup, you know the price you paid for admission was worth it.

I'll be going to SFStl for the first time this year, so we'll see where that stands."

27305,best stocks to buy,"XOM, along with every other energy company, is not interested in going bankrupt.

Oil and gas is the primary product for these companies because it’s economically superior. As soon as something else steals that crown, they’ll switch the producing that.

It’s fairly simple. XOM has the means to pivot 100 times if they want, as do a plethora of other energy companies.

If you don’t want to invest because it’s “against your morals” or whatever, that’s fine…but let’s not pretend it’s a financially-prudent decision"
9087,best toothpaste,"Coincidentally I saw a dental hygienist just this week, and she said that these are ok, but traditional dental floss is better because it's thicker. Whether that's fact or just her opinion I couldn't say. (I use the ones in your picture too)"
