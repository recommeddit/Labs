69667,best major to study in college,"Just a lot of spiritual abuse, bullying, ignorance, inaccurate theology.

I didn't realize how bad most of this was until I began attending my (Christian) college, where my classes were taught by world-renown biblical scholars."

63097,Best online React course,"This is completely on point man. I know - I have done 30% of his course. I would really be happy to do the Schwarzmuller's course, but the problem is that the Schwarzmuller's course has huge problems:

a. He is coding on his own without explaining anything to me and I can't follow him.

b. He introduces useReducer prior to talking for hours about hooks.

While a. might be my own problem, b. is not my own problem, i.e. this problem will affect everybody who interacts with this course.

Thus, what I am doing as follows:

1. I watch videos from Grider and I AM LEARNING STUFF FROM EACH OF THEM, AND I AM ABLE TO FOLLOW EACH OF THEM.
2. Then I create my own codebase based on the section in question. in my own codebase, I use FC instead of CC (Class Components). Whenever I use FC, I find some problems with some solutions he uses for CC, so I google through those problems and I mentor with the mentor. (The CC-FC concversion skill is useless accounting for the current conditions. But it's the price I have to pay in this case. Like, I like rollerstaking. And there's a great stretch of road on the enbankment where I can rollerstake 30km. In order to get there, I need to travel for 20 minutes by bus and 20 minutes by  underground. A friend said that I am an idiot because I could easily rollerstake in the district where I live. I live in Bibirevo Moscow and I travel to Mendeleevskaya Train Station and then I go to the Kremlin and then to Vorobyovy Hills and then back to Kremlin on the other side of the river. The point is that I train for the marathon that I wanna do in the spring 2022. And thus the ancilliary investment of traviling for 1H to the starting point and then 1H back home is completely justified. Why? Because I would not be able to do the same thing in my own district. I tried, and it sucks in terms of enablers for this action plan. My friend doesn't have the same action plan, and thus it's difficult for him to understand me. But, uknow, after I've done my first marathon, I will win. The question here is ""win over whom"" and ""win what""? Google the locations I am talking about and think through this case. This will expland your mentality and you might start thinking about coding in a more utilitarian way which is good coz coding and coding careering is so freaking abstract. Who are trying to win over and what exactly are you trying to win? )

As a result, I get the following outcome:

1. I love every minute of this journey, and I eagerly start the working day every day. I will start today's working day in 5 minutes and I am actually looking forward to it - I don't self-zombify myself.
2. I am learning something every day, I am doing whole projects.
3. There were 3-4 cases when I lost track and I wasn't able to follow the lessons by Grider. In those cases, I needed to stop the course and do the training in specific subjects (CSS Grid, refs in React). After investing the sufficiently large amounts of time into those scopes, I was able to completely follow the course. Thus, ""followability"" is 100%.
4. I don't persist CC into my own codebase and it has only FC. Thus, whenever i do the first interview, I will be talking about FC and not CC. If somebody asks me about the course I did, I will explain my stragegy and how I was doing it. And that person might say that it's BS and I should've done Schwarzmuller, to which I will retort that the Schwarzmuller's course had the bigger problems which I wasn't able to solve. And what do you do when you can't solve a problem? You just sidestep it, and you keep on moving toward the goal. My goal is to find the job opportunity in React within 2 months. I am already going to ""informal interviews"" and I already know 3 Leads, 2 Juns and 3 Seniros. How many do you know? If I had decided to stick with Schwarz, I might have stopped learning coding completely. Seriously. He's that bad. I got to know those folks thanks to me doing the Grider course.

Share you opinions, fears and considerations. As you can see, I invested heavily into writing this post, so you can - and should - come back with a detailed list of considerations, so that we can mastermind together. Also, DM me and I will give you my Telegram so that we can set up a mastermind group and keep on sharing.

P.S. In my POV, there's 97% chance that you are camoufaging another problem by trying to pick the best course. You are afraid that you won't be able to get employed and thus you are fretting that going react might not be the best solution. Whatever course you choose, the decisions in this scope won't enable you to solve this problem. 

I am going to informal interviews and I am getting to know 1-2 React devs every week while I only did 30% of the udemy course. 

how many react dev do you get to know per weekl. Your goal should be one. Networking is the most important skill of any dev. Otherwise, you'll be an Indian with $300 salary working internally."

And there are other little habits to keep your teeth nice and strong like not brushing your teeth right after eating or drinking anything, and not using your teeth on hard things like cracking open pistachios. Many people also need mouthguards when sleeping to protect against grinding"
