The animation style alone made me stay away from it for so long but I feel like it's a must see after so many recs here!
"1. Foundation by Isaac Asimov 
2. Little Heroes by Norman Spinrad
3. Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny"
"Yup! Mine is the Swig Savvy off amazon, I’m sure it’s all the same shit"
"Yeah, Deepness in the Sky definitely works as a stand-alone.  It's really a pleasure to read."
I watched this twice looking for somebody falling asleep on stage.
That's for formal dining you casual

"Gotta be 60hz and arcadey for me. Ever since Ridge Racer and Daytona in the arcades, less than 60fps has been unacceptable for this genre. Racing is one genre that I tend to prefer on console to PC though - with a gamepad and big TV. (And the 'arcade racing' genre was never very big on PC anyway)

Loved OutRun 2. Thoroughly enjoyed Burnout 2+3+Paradise. And Mario Kart games are always great for local multiplayer.

Also loved the first Trackmania game on PC, IMHO they went downhill when they came out with the stadium stuff (less precise control, too much speed, seen-it-all-before?), but they're still good fun in short bursts.

Not a whole lot of recent stuff there though... have I missed anything good?... I wish the Burnout series was still going, really. My only recent racing purchase has been FAST RMX for the Switch, which is pretty cool, but not cars."
Yes! I meant to mention that in my original post: /r/Scholar and /r/Scientific are complementary reddits.
"I was stuck in an airport once and as the hours passed I started reading the fine print on... basically everything. My water bottle, and I'm pretty sure it was the nestle water, said it was purified water from the public water supply of Allentown, PA"
"I think you're missing RedHat which is easily the first one: #3,075"
"Bake your own rice crispy treats if you have the patience, because then the kids get to have a snack during the long walk that is Halloween"
"The US is so big that I'll never have to interact with/live around ppl who voted for trump in large numbers. Our big cities are just as liberal as any major western city (San Francisco, Seattle, LA, Chicago, NYC, Boston, Miami, DC, ect.). This on top of the fact that most of the most livable/most admired states (Washington, Oregon, California, New York, Mass., Hawaii, Colorado, ect.) did not go for Trump."
"I'm probably the opposite of everyone here, but I got my degree in CS (my M.S. in fact), but I hate software development. Yes, you get paid a lot, but it doesn't feel like I'm doing anything real or anything that matters. If I could do it over again, I might do a degree in another science, like biology, and do medical research."
"I'm gonna go play resident evil 5 now, thx m8"
Plus healthcare is far from guaranteed.
"Not really. Performance in games is going to be similar on both laptops, and that Y540 doesn't have a good battery life."
"if you're such a worry wort, you should just stop drinking everything except for perfectly ph neutral distilled water without any added compounds.  oh wait, you'd DIE if you did that.  because you NEED minerals in order to live.  so stop being such a worry wart.  ph 3 vs ph7 isn't going to kill you.  neither is a 0.6ppm vs a 0.1ppm water that contains fluorine.  at this point, we don't have enough knowledge to say that drinking acidic water every day is going to kill you faster vs a ph neutral water.  and the same goes for drinking water that has higher ppm of this or that.  with your mindset, you probably shouldn't even be drinking coffee.  because some research somewhere has shown drinking coffee is bad.  just like i'm sure you've seen some research somewhere that says a higher ppm of this or that is bad for you, which has got you all tangled up in a rut."
">Having said that, you can admit that Tesla builds a phenomenal EV and still not like them.

Funny you should say that--that's where I'm at on the matter! 😁

I wouldn't want a car made by them but it does still seem like they're setting the standard in a lot of respects for BEVs."
What kind of open ended questions? I don’t really understand what you mean.

I can often find the books but a huge number of them aren't being seeded.

"How so? I love Se7en but wouldn’t call it unpredictable? 
If you refer to the very last scene involving a certain item on the ground, then maybe it’s a bit of a surprise. But it doesn’t “twist” the plot? There are plenty of great surprises, though!"
Thaaaaanks for explaining!!
