53799,best medicine for a cold,"Drinking 1-2 tbsp of raw apple cider vinegar mixed into a glass of water. It helps clearing your head/sinuses, kills bacteria, and helps with a sore throat if you gargle it warm.

Also a ton of Vitamin C, tea and sleep. And also rom coms. Those always help."

57182,best water brand,"Tap water costs around [$0.005/gallon.](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/about/live-healthy/tap-water-vs-bottled-water)

Most bottled water is 16 fl oz.  which is eight bottles for one gallon. That makes it $0.96/gallon at your price assuming each bottle is 16 oz (which is remarkably cheap for bottled water).  

So, you can get 192 gallons of water from your tap for the same price you buy a gallon at the store.  Tap water is a LOT less expensive. (If you filter your water at home the tap water will cost more but still be substantially cheaper)

Also, aside from the plastic pollution remember bottled water may be taken from places that will miss that water."
3206,best webcamera,"You are right, but so many ppl are reviewing 922hd as worst in the quality compare to 920 HD... Its weird in 2021 not able to find quality wrb cam review, YouTube and so many blogs where reviews are done with apparently dumb reviewers... All waste of time... To go thru.


Well I was assuming that in 2021 where ppl have 1gib internet connections it should be good to see relatives on Skype etc in the best quality as possible... We are not living in caves anymore..."
34448,best NFL player,"Ask Brady if he'd rather play with a salary cap or no cap but the defense can basically have their way with him without being penalized.  I think I know how he would answer.  I think I know how Joe would answer as well, and they're both probably the same."

5948,best programming language for web development,"###As someone who has been a PHP+MySQL developer for 18 years, and generally hated JavaScript for most of this time:

**JavaScript.**

haha... I've only come to this revelation in the last two months or so.

I'm in the process of learning Node, Express, React and a few other things.  It's really the way everything is going, and I can already see that this workflow is going to be much more efficient + powerful in the long run. 

One language for everything (for webdev at least).  

Node is even becoming pretty popular for building and distributing command line + GUI programs... even programs unrelated to webdev.  Microsoft's very popular VSCode editor (a GUI program) is even written in JavaScript/Typescript.  You also can even use JavaScript inside PostgreSQL.  

I thought that composer/packagist (PHP packages) were awesome in how many there are to do so many different things for you.  But NPM (Javascript/node) blows it away.  And it's pretty cool being able to play around with npm packages in your web browser before even downloading them.  Click the ""Test {packagename} in your browser."" link on the right-hand-side when browsing https://www.npmjs.com/

PHP+MySQL are still going to be around for a long time, and there will be plenty of work here, especially given that common systems like WordPress and Magento are built on them.  Also php/mysql are both are easy to learn for a few reasons: 

* Just technically easy to use for people new to programming
* PHP has the best documentation of any language I've ever come across - the comments are quite helpful too
* There's a bajillion guides for n00bs on the web - however much of it is now bad advice, especially if it was published 2+ years ago.

But I likely won't ever be starting any new projects with PHP or MySQL.  Large ones at least anyway.

On the database side - PostgreSQL is superior in MySQL in pretty much every way, aside from a few uncommon use cases.  Also I suggest not wasting any time with any type of NoSQL database (as your primary datastore).  In most cases postgres will be better.  There are of course exceptions here too, but unlikely to be relevant to you in your first 5 or so years of being a webdev."
