25668,"I generally agree with your first and third paragraphs, but I can't say the same for the middle paragraph. 

Personally, I think high quality aggressive fast bowling is the most exciting thing in cricket. Call it barbaric, but the game is raised to another level when the bowler is a genuine physical threat and not just a threat in cricketing terms. The crowd roars, and you get goosebumps all over. Every second you feel like something is about to happen. In this department the West Indies are supreme, and combined with the stylish batting of Richards (among others), the West Indies were high on entertainment. 

But I don't like what your second paragraph suggests. Liking a cricket team is a very subjective thing, but how can you imply that the Australians didn't ""wear the crown well""? During their period of dominance they were the most entertaining team by a very long way. The sheer brilliance of Warne was awesome to watch, McGrath's relentless wicket taking was a lesson to every bowler, Steve Waugh is the most clutch batsman I've witnessed, junior Waugh's batting was as sublime as anyone's, Ponting was obscenely good in that period from 02-07, Gilchrist's ability to take the game away was almost unfair. They were even great to watch in the field. Healy is the best pure keeper I've seen, Taylor and Waugh are the two best slip fielders I can think of, and whatever Ponting couldn't catch he could throw at the stumps faster than you could blink.

The Australians wore the crown pretty damn well. You don't have to love them, but I can't help feeling that associating them with the notion that ""they've not been good champions"" is just irrational bitterness.",best cricket teams of all time

25667,"WI of the 70s and 80s will always be (subjectively) better for me. Waugh's team were very good, but I got more enjoyment from watching the Windies. Both could be bullies on their day (Sir Viv was not averse to excessive and intimidatory appealing) but I always found the WI to be more exciting and better to watch. Plus they had Marshall.

I'm kind of reminded of *The Damned United*, Brian Clough commenting on Leeds before taking the post (and yes, I am aware that it's a work of fiction): ""They've been champions, yes, but they've not been *good* champions, in the sense of wearing the crown well."" Waugh's team will be remembered for being highly talented and successful, but I cannot bring myself to love them.

It's a similar reason that I prefer Lara to Tendulkar. Completely subjective, and disregarding of the stats. But Lara somehow is a better embodiment of the spirit of cricket to me than Tendulkar. In many ways it's unfortunate that they were contemporaries, because otherwise I'd see Tendulkar in a more positive light.",best cricket teams of all time
