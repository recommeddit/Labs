34660,best NFL player,"So you’re saying AD used to be Adrian Peterson, but then it switched."
29704,best game console,"The Genesis was amazing. The games all had a certain, unique feel to them. Plus, the game's OSTs on the system all had this badass techno/electronic/Retrowave sound to them.

I love it."
20517,best workout music,Yes you can.. I blame the economy
38065,best Marvel movie,"There is so much wrong with this that I don't even know where to start. I mean, I'm not saying my opinion is better than any else's, but I mean, what even is this monstrosity? So many questions. How does Infinity War not make it into top 10? How is Winter Soldier at 9? How is Black Panther at the top? And those are just the the big ones..."
21876,best winnie the pooh comic,"Anyone else feel like piglet is just totally done with poohs shit. Pooh comes around every day and smothers him in honey, threatens to eat him then leaves.

And piglet just sits there with that bored expression on his face."

29678,best game console,"man i sure do miss the hell out of gears of war, i remember playing that shit for hours"
51912,best iphone case,I just made the same switch. Is it me or is the new leather nowhere near as good as the Pro 11 case? It seems it’s the thinnest layer of leather possible. The 11 case had some thickness to it.
21672,best winnie the pooh comic,more like winnie the dick
69210,best major to study in college,"> No regrets (luck and timing had a lot to do with my good fortune).

Having seen enough people around me being quite successful (and others, failing pretty badly), I have come to the conclusion that blaming it on luck and timing is often a gross oversimplification.

Some people keep making smart choices, take risks, and always find new challenges, and eventually one of these risks works out and they ""get lucky"". Others always play it safe and do what conventional wisdom requires, and not surprisingly, ""luck"" never finds them.

There never is a guarantee that any particular gamble is going to work out. But unless you give ""luck"" a chance, it doesn't matter how much you keep talking about luck and good timing; it'll never be you. 

I used to dismiss the achievements of people who simply got luck; these days, I feel that if luck is given as the reason, then we probably haven't heard the full story."
5108,best home improvement store,"I also miss Orchard Supply. It was the closest hardware store (and only one when I was young) and small enough that I knew where everything was. My local one always had a nice garden center and pet supplies, too.

But despite that, I still hate Home Depot more than Lowe's. I can never find anything at HD, the inventory system is worthless (there should be 20 of something, but there are zero on the aisle), and their app only ever says ""ask an associate"" when I try to use it for item locations."
34151,best NFL player,Jerry Rice or Sweetness.

13758,best research paper archive,This is a definite must read. Explains a lot about cancer and its mechanisms in an extremely concise manner. The update to this first paper is also very helpful. The link for that is floating around somewhere here.
60439,Best comedy show on Netflix,*Stop acting like a disgruntled pelican.*
41148,best instrument to play,"That's no reason to discourage him from learning an instrument at all. No one said he had to play at professional level and the idea that you can't learn after 21 is just stupid bullshit.

HEY OP!! I HOPE YOU ENJOY YEARS OF PLAYING WHICHEVER INSTRUMENT YOU CHOOSE AND DON'T LISTEN TO THESE NAYSAYERS!!"
17352,best iOS game,I stopped reading at the Kim Kardashian game.
26135,best politician,"And what is funny is that he was the most pugnacious of the Kennedys in private.  Apparently, his brothers, who were more physically imposing than he would bully him growing up."
47403,best state to visit in the United States,"Unless you are going to Mount Hood, Oregon, the only place to ski 12 months a year in the continental United States, you don't want to make that trip in August or September, if skiing is high on your list."
16215,best sunglasses for fashion,"Check out Shady Rays. Not too expensive and they look good. And you get two fuck ups, where they will send you a new pair for free"
28182,best breakfast foods,"About 4 months ago I purchased a food processor with a shredding disk. Since then, every time I have the time to make breakfast, I make hash browns from scratch. There's nothing better than fresh hash browns with some red onion, a little cheese, and a side of bacon."
5009,best home improvement store,"Ah, cool, cool. Was just wondering. Peace."
68803,best science fiction novel,"Ahhh, thanks."
