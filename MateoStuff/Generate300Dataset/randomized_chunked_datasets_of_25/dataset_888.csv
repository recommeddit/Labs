69210,"> No regrets (luck and timing had a lot to do with my good fortune).

Having seen enough people around me being quite successful (and others, failing pretty badly), I have come to the conclusion that blaming it on luck and timing is often a gross oversimplification.

Some people keep making smart choices, take risks, and always find new challenges, and eventually one of these risks works out and they ""get lucky"". Others always play it safe and do what conventional wisdom requires, and not surprisingly, ""luck"" never finds them.

There never is a guarantee that any particular gamble is going to work out. But unless you give ""luck"" a chance, it doesn't matter how much you keep talking about luck and good timing; it'll never be you. 

I used to dismiss the achievements of people who simply got luck; these days, I feel that if luck is given as the reason, then we probably haven't heard the full story.",best major to study in college
5108,"I also miss Orchard Supply. It was the closest hardware store (and only one when I was young) and small enough that I knew where everything was. My local one always had a nice garden center and pet supplies, too.

But despite that, I still hate Home Depot more than Lowe's. I can never find anything at HD, the inventory system is worthless (there should be 20 of something, but there are zero on the aisle), and their app only ever says ""ask an associate"" when I try to use it for item locations.",best home improvement store
