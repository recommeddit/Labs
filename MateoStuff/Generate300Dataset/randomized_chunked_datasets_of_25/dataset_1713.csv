68362,best science fiction novel,Thank you! I bought ‘A Fire Upon the Deep’ straight away. You never know what you’ll discover this way. Looking forward to discovering a new author :-)
31081,best country to live in,"I currently in Vancouver and grew up in Ottawa, can confirm that Vancouver climate is very mild. It might be the only place in Canada where it doesn't constantly snow and doesn't have -30 winters. It might snow 5-10 days in the winter, it might get as low as -10, but that's nothing compared to the rest of Canada. There's just a lot of rain. 

Can also confirm that Vancouver checks off all the boxes that OP mentioned, it's a beautiful place but cost of living and especially real estate is very high."
2273,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Right? They put a little too much of that butter sauce for me but they’re super good.
4719,best home improvement store,"I know HD is a flat fee, so if you buy 10 pallets of pavers it will be the same fee as if it were 2. It's a good deal for bulk product but not so much otherwise."
20496,best workout music,Or Take the Power Back!
57610,best cologne,Daaamn. Pretty genius
30031,best money managing app,"SAME! Super helpful ng sumifs function. I love being super organized and specific with my expenses and finances in general, and I figured na it’s much better to just make my own rather than use an app na limited ang features based on my needs and preferences."
41735,movies like Inception,Donnie darko is the ultimate head fuck.
39262,best web browser,"Safari is probably the best looking and most elegant browser, but it lacks extensibility.

I'd say the next best option would be Firefox."
24232,best anime,"Nice, that's fantastic. Seems like you had the sources ready, in case someone was asking for them, which is always great, since it makes the list much more trustworthy (without sources, it tends to just look like a personal list).

Really like the list BTW, since it seems more varied than most lists out there, as it's not as heavily skewed towards male+dark+action anime as many ranking pages from the west, tend to be. Still very few kids anime (only Heidi of the Alps), but that's to be expected when gathered from online rankings, and it's 1 more than expected."
1911,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I have a ton, I’ve spent most of my time in SF, so definitely Tony’s, but really anywhere in North Beach is good. Honestly almost every place in the city is good.

I mostly don’t like the soft bready “pizza parlor” dough that places like Rusty’s, Marty’s, Giovannis, woodstock’s etc use. Sure, I’ll it eat it and won’t bring it up but I wouldn’t consider it to be “good pizza”.

Edit: being downvoted?"

22776,best celebrity,"""too bad. may we have a autograph from your daughter instead? we're huge fans"""
34095,best NFL player,"Barry Sanders... the most elusive player in NFL history. I go back and watch his highlights occasionally just to blow my mind all over again... and every time I re-realize that there simply isn't anyone like him in the NFL right now. 

Just to show how dominant he was at the position, some career YPC averages for a few notable players:

- Marcus Allen - 4.1
- LaDanian Tomlinson - 4.3
- Tiki Barber - 4.7 
- Jerome Bettis - 3.9
- Emmitt Smith - 4.2
- Walter Payton - 4.4
- Barry Sanders - 5.0 - did I mention he was playing for the 1990's Lions?

Jim Brown and Jerry Rice come close, but [nobody's had moves like Barry.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsFhZy9oxuk&feature=related)"

54091,best medicine for a cold,"take a hot shower 3 times a day, and try to blow as much mucous out of your nose as possible. The hot water will make it go runny in your sinuses and it will come out in handfuls. It is absolutely fucking disgusting, but it washes right off and then you get out with clean sinuses.

I do this because I don't like taking drugs for minor sicknesses, I don't like their side effects."
70716,best movies with a cool twist,Go fuck yourself
29847,best money managing app,"If you don’t mind me asking, how do I go about learning to make my own sheet? I feel so overwhelmed with the different functions. I know my goal is to make one my scratch and set it up in a specific way. Just don’t know how to get started"
15594,best tree for the garden,"Hops. Or, in the long term, black walnut. (EDIT: Long term like 30+ years. Wood for veneers is what I'm talking about.)"

18190,best YouTube video,OH JESUS CHRIST
18817,best YouTube video,"Did you win your middle school film festival? I think there are a lot of really good ideas in this film. I think 11 year old you might not have had a grasp on theme and tone because it seems to dip and swirl and lose sight of two themes I really enjoy in it: the play on perspective, seeing common things from a different perspective greatly changes my thoughts on it, but nostalgia too. I'm sure you didn't intend nostalgia to be a big part of it seeing as you were a young boy, but watching this gave me an insight into childhood I haven't felt since I was that age. Kudos man, my films when I was 11-12 were about me kicking alien ninjas in the face and there were no alien ninjas ever on the screen..."
15524,best tree for the garden,Thanks :) this is actualy what we have growing on our land. Except the cherimoya. We are buying trees this year to plant.
