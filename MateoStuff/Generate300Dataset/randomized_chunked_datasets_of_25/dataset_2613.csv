Dreaming about it.  If, for you, the instrument that calls to you is the nose flute, than that is what you should learn to play and master.  Music comes from the heart.  To play really well you and your instrument have to be connected on some ineffable level.  -- If you want to master music _theory_, (ie, achieve a superior academic and intellectual understanding of musicial communication) then piano.  If you want to master _music_, then you need to match your soul to the instrument.",best instrument to play

46746,"So, in reply to someone above, I dug through a couple MSDS, and a few other published papers for some math time.   
 I'll paste it below, if you want to be really alarmed:    


**The lowest lethal dose for humans is listed at just 143mg/kg oral, and 428mg/kg dermal**   

Other MSDS show acute toxicity (single dose needed to produce toxic effects) of methanol in humans as 100mg/kg oral, and 300mg/kg dermal.   
(https://www.labchem.com/tools/msds/msds/VT430.pdf)

Also, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol, it is recommended that methanol be considered cumulative, so every individual dose added together.   

 According to the publication ""Methanol Toxicity"", Permanent visual damage can occur from a single 30ml oral dose.   
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482121/)

The same publication recommends, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol,   
that methanol be considered cumulative, for purposes of treatment (all doses over days, added together, considered as total dose)


**Time for some real (and alarming) napkin math:**   

The lowest lethal dose by skin absorption, for your hypothetical 200lb (90.718kg) man,   
 would be just 38.8273 grams over multiple days.    

Worst case hand sanitizer tested so far in the ban list is Lavar Gel containing 81% Methanol   
 (47.9349 grams of sanitizer contains 38.8273 pure methanol)

Hand sanitizer weighs 0.875 g/cm3(ml) (data from purel advanced, cause it was the first MSDS I found)

The minimum amount needed per use to cover small hands is 3ml (source: https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(16)30690-3/abstract).    


**So, if the hypothetical 200lb man had small hands, just over 18 applications of Lavar Gel hand sanitizer, over a few days time, would be enough to potentially kill him.**   
Yea, worst case chosen for effect, however:   
If you are working in a customer-facing position, you probably sanitize your hands way more than that every shift.   
Even some of the lower tested ones on the ban list were over 20% methanol, so go ahead and multiply that by 4, and it would still be easy to get that much exposure in a job where you sanitize regularly.   
And this is just to kill them, the effects of Methanol toxicity start lower, and are really bad, some permanently damaging.


**TLDR; The potential for death and permanent damage is way higher than one imagines by skin application of methanol in contaminated hand sanitizer for the average worker**

Edited TLDR to specify contaminated hand sanitizer, the allowable amounts of methanol in proper hand sanitizer is too small of an amount to be worried about.",best hand santizer brand
