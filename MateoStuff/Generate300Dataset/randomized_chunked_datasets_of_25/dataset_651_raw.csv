"For a native that hasn’t had pizza outside of Southern California, what makes a good pizza? 
I find Patrini’s has the best sauce and sometimes I do crave that cracker style thin crust"
"Came into this thread thinking of this. I leave satisfied.

I also think *The Stars My Destination* (or *Tiger, Tiger* for the purists), by Alfred Bester is very action packed. But maybe I just read it in a very action packed moment of my life."
":( I didn't realize you were divorced. 

What are your kids like?"
6 months! He's good.
"Definitely healthier. The only low quality of the dining halls is the meat which is to be expected. I work for dining services and disagree with you, having seen the ingredients used and how often fresh central coast produce and dairy are brought in. I am also a nutrition enthusiast and avid gymrat,  so I'm pretty knowledgeable on macronutrients and hardcore with the food I choose to eat.


I get access to baked sweet potatoes, fresh produce from the Santa Ynez valley, along with organic milk, and a decent piece of meat with every meal among other things. Can't complain."
"The bigger problem with Redux in the course is that the Redux team specifically says it should not be used by new React developers and is an advanced pattern. But Grider teaches it as part of a beginners course, which turns a lot of people off with its complexity. I had a conversation about a year ago on HN with a Redux dev and Grider himself where the Redux dev asked Grider to stop teaching Redux to newbies because the advanced topic and complexity leads people to hate Redux."
Gin&Tonic or Long Island Iced Tea.
"Obviously I don't know your situation, but it may also be that he is afraid of putting that title on you, as it may scare/piss you off.  That would be my concern.  But I agree with the responses, you guys should discuss it."
Try 'Doing Data Science'
"Do you have any scientific reference for your baking soda comment? Not doubting you, just having trouble finding one myself!"
Maybe because I am a bit of a metal head this list slightly disappoints me. I always find Slipknot awesome to work out to. Pulse of the Maggots is awesome before doing a huge squat set.
"Why McGrath tho? I've never understood why people put him in all Time xi. He's great but I think haddlee was about the same with the ball, but hadlee can bat so why pick McGrath over haddlee?"
"I could not get enough data on LAC's from the rankings that I used. Only USNews ranked the LACS among the four that I used

See my reasons above for why I did not use the Forbes ranking for myself"

"Gone girl leaves you with a weird feeling a the end. Definitely worth the watch, though."
"I’m pretty sure it was because Chloe insulted Kim for posting her nude bathroom pic and then Kim also replied and said something like “let’s welcome Chloe moretz to the party, I loved your (some sort of risqué mag cover she recently did) boo”. I don’t think it had anything to do with the Taylor and Kanye situation."
"That goddamn peanut butter spackle in the orange and black wrappers.  I think some refer to it as ""taffy"" and I'm pretty sure it was engineered by evil dentists to tear fillings out, break teeth and leave a trail of tears from houses to their offices.  The fact that it's peanut butter appeals to so many but once that glob of hate is in your mouth and you have sunk your teeth in, you realize you made a horrible mistake but there is no going back.  You feverishly chew and chew, hoping to God the pain building in jaw is temporary.  And I don't even know if you can chew that crap into a reasonable pulp.  I think, in my experience, you work up enough saliva to either swallow and pray there aren't any sharp corners left or spit it out.  No one really eats that stuff unless you're in stage five sugar withdrawl and all the good candy is gone.

That stuff is the **WORST**


And the best... Reese's Peanut Butter Cups..."
She’s got a promising career ahead of her. I was pleasantly surprised at her album- but then she came thru with that Ricky Martin feature? Damn this girls got a dope trajectory
"how is saying someone has a 25% chance of winning, and having that person win, indicates the models were ""wrong""? That's a dumb thing to say"
I’m in the same boat. Waiting on model d reviews to go with that or just bite the bullet and go buy another ec1 with the new coating
New lazy boy recliner.
Ive played true skate the most consistently lol
"How clicky are the buttons on the case for you? I've got the leather case for my 13 Pro but the buttons (especially the power button) are very mushy and hard to press when compared to the leather case for the 11 Pro I had before.  
Not sure if normal or a defective case."
"If my local library had even half the books in stock that I search for, I'd be there. I prefer the feeling of an actual book. But this website is awesome. Used to have to navigate torrent sites to hope to find a book. This has everything I've looked for so far"
Here for this answer.
