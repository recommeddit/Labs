"I've heard that about FP from a lot of people - I'm friends with a couple baristas there so maybe I get preferential treatment! I typically buy their beans more than I get coffee to go, as well.  
  
Caje's new spot on Hayley is super cute - their pour overs are delicious and the lunch menu is an added bonus.
  
Low Pigeon specializes more in espresso - it's a little pricey but definitely the best I've had in town. It's also directly across the street from Caje."

+1 for ELECOM after trying Paperlike (1) and Moko.

Dude you wanna go to a party together? You seem like you’d be fun at parties
/r/FragDecants  is also a great resource for buying smaller quantities of fragrances. I've bought small bottles of a bunch of Creeds which I never would have bought at full retail.

"It's like a who's who of mid 90s east coast hip-hop producers. DJ Premier, Q-Tip, Large Professor, Pete Rock. It still amazes me that he managed to get such amazing producers on a debut LP."

"KDE's `Dolphin` 'cause I like it, works fine for my needs and... Well... It's part of KDE.

I heavily use `F3` and `F4` shortcuts/features and I like that way."

"Funnily enough I'm in SLO now, we haven't been to either unfortunately tho. We've only been coming up here for about two months since we moved and an hour and a half away (we're closer to Santa Maria, but man that place sucks a big one). We will definitely try both places, Scout looks promising!! Thanks for letting me know they exist!!"
