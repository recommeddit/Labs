Like Iron Rattler or Superman Krypton?"
"I strongly recommend Chicago, but I'm a resident so I'm biased. If you're considering Chicago, try hitting up [/r/chicago](/r/chicago) first. The sidebar has a great set of recommendations for things to see and things to eat. Also, little known fact: we have pretty solid beaches. They're beaches on a lake, too, so you get the weirdness of vast, mostly waveless, freshwater swimming spots.

There's a very strong redditor community here. People would probably be happy to show you around and take you out.

Alas, if your goal is ribs, you can get them here, but they're nothing like the ribs in Tennessee or the Carolinas. That said, consider Charleston, South Carolina as well."
I'm a dentist here in Sweden. I suggest you go fuck yourself.

"Waffles with a little grits mixed into the batter is excellent. That texture.

Yeeep. I had rats for years. I've not got 2 cats and a dog and they're so much easier(and less expensive) than my rats were.
C’mon KY. Swedish fish? I know we’re backwards but damn.
I haven't tried Philosykos in years but Profumum's longevity is excellent. Even their freshies last 10hrs+
"Urgh, I bought an emo hammock and my experience with it has been miserable."
"It's not my favourite, but I really enjoy The Rundown with the Rock and Stifler."
What a team!

Metro and Evening Standard. They're free.
"Northern New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine"
With regards to Shinsekai Yorki I got to episode 10 and I just couldn't do it anymore. It wasn't for me personally and often times I had to force myself to go on. I think that by Ep 10 if you haven't gotten me engaged it's kind of too late.
Which one in particular are you looking at?

"Hmm, interesting, I think he was leading a competing group, a private one. I'm probably mistaken."
"Don't care what the ""best"" is. I use Chrome and it does everything I want and it plays nice with my Android phones."
"Only on Reddit one stumbles upon gems like this (at least it seems like it, I'm installing it now)"
"I don't find them too loud but I can see why someone would say otherwise. To be honest when I have someone in the same room I usually play games that go better with a controller anyway. If I am using my keyboard for gaming that means I am playing battlefield 1 or league of legends with my friends and you know what?  The sound that comes from the keyboard is irrelevant compared to all the talking and sometimes screaming and cursing hehe. So yeah, I don't want my SO anywhere near me when I am playing with my friends online."
That excluded OpenSUSE because I said I wanted to install programs myself during installation. I just installed OpenSUSE and I have the choice of what got installed.
