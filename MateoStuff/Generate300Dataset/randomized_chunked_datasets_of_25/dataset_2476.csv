68519,"My absolute favorite book is God Emperor of Dune, the 4th book in the Dune series. It is one of those books that you either love or hate because its so different stylistically from other books. Its a lot more monologue than action, but what that means is you NEED to pay attention.

To me, Dune is so exceptional because its not just a book but a full on experience.",best science fiction novel
