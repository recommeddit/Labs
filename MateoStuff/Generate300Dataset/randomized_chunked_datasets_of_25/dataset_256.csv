55863,best action and adventure movie,The pile of shit that was Raise the Titanic(oh hell ya there was another Cussler movie)made Cussler swear he'd never do it again. He eventually let them do Sahara because of some script control and we all know how that turned out. It was a decent flick but it sure as hell wasn't a Dirk Pitt adventure. I believe it's safe to say no more Pitt until Cussler is dead and even then probably not.

926,best desk lamp,"I didn't want to lose any desk space to the footprint of the lamp, but still wanted a high quality adjustable lamp.  This one is a bit expensive, but it's been fantastic.  LED, you can adjust the color temperature and brightness easily.

62475,Best RPG game on PS4,"I would argue that AC Odyssey is more of an RPG than AC Origins though. Odyssey has different dialog options, lots of upgradable loot, skill trees, optional side quests and you can totally finish missions in different ways. I agree it's all very light, but in that way it's not that different from the Witcher which Ubisoft clearly tries to mimic with the new AC games."
