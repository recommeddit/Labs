57166,"Distilling and deionizing are different things.  Both of them result in more pure water than you start with, but in different ways.  Generally, distilling has a hard time removing certain compounds that happen to have about the same boiling point as water, deionizing will have trouble with non-dissolved matter, such as sediment, bacteria or other organic matter.  Of course you can also add regular filtration to remove some of that as well.",best water brand

52137,"i bought [this](http://www.mytrendyphone.eu/shop/iphone-6-ballistic-138329p.html)(which in the US, is an [AT&T exclusive](http://www.att.com/cases/ballistic-glitter-jewel-iphone-case-for-iphone-6.html) it seems like. only linked that weird eu site because it was the only place with a good picture) kind of as a joke, and a temporary case while i found one i liked. I ended up loving it. It's really slim, except at the corners. It elevates the phone off of a surface quite a bit(like probably 5mm) if the screen is face down. Stays on good, doesn't stick to my pocket. 

Also it looks *hilarious*. Everyone has something to say about it, or at least does a double take. 

The 6 versions of cases i've liked in the past, like the candyshell just did nothing for me. I'm debating getting something like a grovemade, miniot, or iwooden... but this case is actually pretty nice. It's like one of those super thin TPU cases, but with corner, drop, and face down fall protection. And it only bulks up the phone at the corners. Also it's hilarious.",best iphone case
