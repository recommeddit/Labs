Apparently people keep finding this post while searching for info on Berkey filters.  So, here's some useful links I found while finishing my research.

Here's The Wirecutter's article on the Berkey:  https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/big-berkey-water-filter-system/

Basically:  If it's not NSF certified, you can't trust it.  ""NSF compliant but not certified"" means ""noncompliant.""  The more ridiculous your claims are about contaminants and longevity, the more expensive it is to do NSF testing.  Therefore, Berkey didn't want to pay the money to back up their claims, so they paid a smaller lab to do cheaper tests that you can't trust.

I ultimately bought the Brita Longlast, which is cheaper and more convenient.  I learned about it through this Wirecutter article:  https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-water-filter-pitcher/

None of Berkey's competition in the gravity filter space is NSF certified (I think), so I wouldn't waste your time, money, and counter space on any of them.

I'm in the middle of doing research about gravity-fed countertop water filters -- stuff like Berkey's units.  I haven't actually bought one myself; I'm still in the research phase.  Sadly nobody on Reddit seems to be talking about these things outside of doomsday prep subreddits.

Here's Berkey's website (though you probably would end up buying on amazon):  https://www.berkeyfilters.com/

The other main competitor I'm looking at is AquaCera:  http://www.aquacera.com/gravity-systems.html

I'm presently interested in AquaCera's CeraMetix filter elements.  You should replace the filters in units like these once a year because of the potential for bacteria growth (even though they claim to filter bacteria...), so the question is more than just ""What's the price per gallon of a filter element?"" because you're going to replace them yearly.  IIRC the CeraMetix elements are $40 each, and you're going to want two of them each year, probably, which is $80 yearly for filters total.  Berkey's replacement filters are $150 for two, which is too much.  Also, the CeraMetix filters are supposed to filter out fluoride and stuff too without add-ons, so that's an advantage over the Berkey filters.  (Fluoride might be a neurotoxin even at the diluted levels found in fluoridated water, but I haven't done enough research to say with certainty if that's true or not, and is likely outside the scope of this subreddit.)

I currently own a Brita filter, and it doesn't help the water very much at all.  I have not been impressed with it.

While the ZeroWater filter system is in the same ballpark as Berkey and AquaCera in terms of how well they filter the water, their filters last a fraction as long.  Their filters are $15 and filter 40 gallons max.  If you assume a two-person household drinks two gallons of water per person per day, that's ~1,500 gallons a year, and about $560 a year for filters, but only if you replace them every 40 gallons according to the manufacturer.

None of the filter elements are BIFL, obviously.",best water filter

67257,"Error handling shouldn't be ""expected"". If you are expecting an error from a request, then you have an issue with your system (or of course could be unfortunately dependent on a faulty system).  


One of the reasons this comes up is because programmers use 404 incorrectly a whole lot to mean ""empty state"" instead of it's actually meaning. For example if I request /users/4/allergies and user 4 has zero allergies, I should get back \[\], and not a 404, because an empty response IS the valid resource that is there. However, many developers have returned a 404 in cases like this.  


The issue is that this pollutes the meaning of 404 and makes it hard to understand. Is this just a resource with an empty response? Or did I actually call a non-existent resource?  


a 404 should always be the latter, which should always be an error. It should not be expected, and thus should throw, and not be handled inside your normal flow control.",axios alternatives reddit
