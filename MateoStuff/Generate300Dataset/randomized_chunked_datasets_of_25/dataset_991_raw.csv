">Edit (x2) do not brush your teeth with baking soda or similar products. Youâ€™re never going to grow back that enamel youâ€™ve sandpapered off every morning and night!

Are baking soda toothpastes bad too? Or just the straight up baking soda? Are the whitening toothpastes that abrade your teeth messing with my enamel?"
"Lavender. 

I used to hate the hell out of flower flavored things - made me feel like I was eating soap but one day I decided to go for it and suddenly Lavender Ice Cream has changed my life forever."

"Thanks, just favourite films and actors of mine.... I am quite interested about your list. Your knowledge on old films is very extensive. I have always taken your recommendations seriously.....+ you are the coolest guy I have seen on this sub which thinking about your age is impressive....."
"Another Irish here.

Firstly, I'd say that Ireland is basically a centre-right country. I'd wager that about 80% of the people I've talked to (mostly teenagers) are for marriage equality. However, my father's generation (~40) would be more like 55-60% in favour. In any case, I expect that Ireland will only become more liberal in the next few decades, as my generation matures.

Speaking Irish is utterly optional. In fact, the majority of Irish people could only speak a few sentences (myself included, though I've become a lot better in the last year or so) . Unless you go to the Gaeltacht areas, where Irish is the primary language, you won't have any trouble, and even then they're hardly going to throw you out for not talking ""as Gaeilge"".

Regarding college choice, I'm afraid I can't give you anything more than conjecture, so take what I say with a pinch of salt. But, as far as I know, UCD is a more STEM focused college than Trinity, which is more well known for its arts and humanities (particularly the English department). Therefore I suggest you go to UCD for a CS course (not to be confused with the college on the other side of Dublin, DCU.)

I hope that what I've said helps you in making a decision!"
"Stetson, this list shows an incredible amount of work. Great job!! I used to try to maintain a much smaller list but gave up with all of the changes that happen in the prepaid sector. This was before T-Mobile greatly expanded their network so I didn't include T-Mobile plans at that time due to coverage. I've been a prepaid customer since 2008 and I've tried quite a few providers since then. I've looked at your latest update to your chart and I see that you list Ultra Mobile's $39/m 50gb plan but you don't recommend it. I'm just curious as to why you don't. Have you not tried the plan yet? I see it as similar as US Mobile's 'unlimited all' except the taxes are less and it includes hotspot, international text and some international calling. It doesn't include international roaming like US Mobile does but that seems to be the only downside. I think it compares very well to the US Mobile All Unlimited plans on Verizon but at the lowest price point."

"KOURTNEY--chill, mom, not as concerned with fame as her sisters...the secret badass of the show and the coolest sister (unpopular opinion, i kno)

Cory--chills in the background while Kris treats him like shit

Kylie--Probably the most ""interesting to look at"", winning the game of life rn...however i somehow feel like she's under too much pressure.

Kim--Kim is becoming kind of a dork to me...But I like that? She's surprisingly human

Khloe--hung Rob out to dry and continues to...she looks like a meme?  ALSO--conspiracy theory that Kylie's style has been heavily influenced by Khloe's...I feel like its subtle?But they were close... she deserves more credit IMO? 

Rob--tragic...watched an earlier episode where Rob cries during family therapy and says ""I feel like my dad would have understood me""

Kendall--i feel like she thinks she's cooler than she is?

 Honorable mention: blac chyna...almost blac Kardashian!!!!!!! COME ON. That is epic"
"Don't forget that Villeneuve was a pantywaster who was brown-trousered-scared of the British. At the time of the battle he'd decided to retreat, but his ships were so poorly trained that they couldn't tack through the wind or stay on station, resulting in his entire fleet being a crescent-shaped smear on the ocean when Collingwood and the Royal Sovereign bum-rushed them.

About the only ship in the Combined Fleet that distinguished itself was the Redoubtable (French 74) which managed to keep the Victory off the French flagship and needed the combined attentions of both Victory and Temeraire to make it strike. As I recall, the Redoubtable lost well over half their crew dead, with the majority of the survivors wounded. Only 35 men out of 650 made it off that ship alive and uninjured."
"Last year, my son's daycare made a foam board picture of him with his handprints on the back. Being a newborn, we have tons of pictures of him, but this one is special to me for reasons that are tough to explain. When I changed jobs, it was the last thing I took off of my old desk and the first thing I put up at my new one."
Smart bulbs. Put one in a lamp in your bedroom and have it slowly brighten in the morning. It will change your life.
"oooh ive got 4 currently. all are relatively cheap, with the most expensive around 80$ (but half price if you buy two)

* absolute fuchsia diamond paris
* princess marina de bourbon paris marina blue
* scandalous from Victoria's secret
* i am happy from maurices

absolute fuchsia has a distinct scent, hard to describe, sweet with a strong tinge of the alcohol

marina blue is a very light, fresh scent, it reminds me of the ocean a bit even though it isnt at all salty.

scandalous is the ""heaviest"" scent i own. its the sort of thing i would wear on a date where i planned to do more than kiss :P

i am happy is a light, fruityish scent, it has the least smell of the alcohol, and lasts the shortest period of time (it was only 18$) Its the sort of thing i put on in the morning, or marina blue, rather than fuchsia or scandalous, which strike me as more evening scents :)"
That's owned by T-Mobile.

I was in the middle of googling it to see what it smelled like. T_T"

"I have a few different colognes for different occasions.

* 1. Dior Sauvage - Safe scent, need to go easy on the trigger with this one. It's extremely popular and if you're at an event/wedding you'll probably notice it on other people.
* 2. Prada L'Homme - the cologne I wear when I'm on the job. Very clean and inoffensive. Smells like expensive soap with the prominent iris note.
* 3. La Nuit de L'Homme - This one is for dates/close encounters, it doesn't last the longest or project too far, but that's not the point, it's sensual and soft yet masculine.
* 4. Dior Fahrenheit - This one is a classic from the 80's, it has a unique gasoline-type of note that comes from the leather/violet leaf, this one works on cold winter days.
* 5. Creed Aventus - I only wear this one on special occasions, I lucked out and got a bottle at Costco for around $70. You'll see a lot of hype online for it, but it's definitely not worth the high price tag of $300+ in my opinion.

Best advice I can give is to go to your local department store and get some samples and see what jumps out at you. Don't get too sucked into what you see online or what girls say is their favourite, in reality as long as you apply the right amount (1-2 sprays) and the cologne works with your body chemistry, you're going to smell good regardless of what you choose."
"I have a couple depending on how I want to race that day. 

All out thrill and adrenaline:  Dirt Rally.

Simulation Feel/good FFB: Assetto Corsa

Fun with friends drifting/setting lap times: Forza 6.

All these games offer something different. I probably play dirt rally the most, it's just so much fun and the game is hard as fuck, so it's very rewarding when you start killing it.

Assetto Corsa has an excellent handling model and is very challenging. Another bonus about this game is there is nearly unlimited cars/tracks through mods, oh and drifting is phenomenal, however there's no way to ""keep a score"" As there is in Forza.

Forza is a game I've been playing since forza 3, and I still think it's the best casual racing series ever, shit load of cars, fun handling model, seamless multiplayer with friends. Obvious downside is it's on Xbox one, but Horizon 3 is pretty good (not as good is the ""motorsport"" games in my opinion) and can be had on pc."
"Ohhhh......I'm very private and travel alone. My first thing is to stick the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign up. I was in and out (B-and-B) would have breakfast, talk with the staff and other guests, hit my festival, etc.

I was SUPER annoyed when I came back the fourth day to my room being cleaned and the sign ignored. It never occurred to me that maybe they were just ""checking up""."
Thank you for the suggestion friend!
"Dentist told me to avoid the whitening toothpastes as they really do a number on your enamel!  I had no idea until I told her at my last cleaning that I'd been experiencing some temperature sensitivity all of a sudden...I just thought it was because I was older and when she found out that I had been using whitening toothpastes, she told me to stop.

best thing is to floss at night every night and brush twice daily (AM, PM).

Avoid sugary things as much as possible.

what also helped me - and I have no idea if this actually helps - but after eating or drinking anything other than water, I always rinse my mouth with water.  It seems to help (?) because in my 46yrs, I have only had 3 cavities and both were tiny enough that it could be filled w/out freezing.  The last time I went to the dentist prior to my last visit was about 2yrs, no cavities."
