"That is awesome to hear.  I will need to re-look at it.  BTW, what is ALM?"

"To add to this as a Michigander:
If you're looking for some non-outdoorsy fun check out Ann Arbor and Detroit, and if you're a beer fan go to Grand Rapids, die and go to heaven."

"There is a subreddit for everything!

I thought that this would be a neat idea, looks like it was already implemented. Sometimes there are just some papers that I don't have access too / interlibrary loan doesnt work."

"Mid-century modern, blended Modern (30's) and Contemporary('44-45) minimalism(60's-70's). I feel like it was/is The Benjamin Button, of the American visual design arts movement.  

I've never been formally educated in interior design, but I'm totally open to being corrected on the subject!"

"is anyone here reading Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow et al? 

How did you find the book thus far ?"
"Yo much love for Q, I can only hope Oxy takes that next step (this question should be reposted after the album drops)"
"I've only ever used Linkedin and Twitter, yet at a minimum, I would suggest Linkedin. 

Otherwise, you should have a spreadsheet or rolodex and email folks every now and again to check in and update them on your life."
I used to have a similar problem I started buying longer angled plugs so I wasn't bending the cable as much or yanking on the wall side either.
"Here's a workout mix I made.  It's geared toward pumping you up for max effort lifts, so it's all aggressive house music. http://youtu.be/dkPS1Nx1Q80

I'll definitely use this thread for suggestions on a more mainstream mix."
"My go-to choices are [The Prodigy - Smack My Bitch Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoURQz1_c0U) NSFW, [Motorhead - The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_JF8oSxXtM) and the montage theme by [Vince Dicola for Rocky IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuzZmWVNlkQ)."

I liked the movie. But it was so obvious with the Chinese guy and the cat and the twins and everything that it kept me from enjoying the movie as much as I think I otherwise could have."
"You forgot the French and Indian war. Or the entire war against the Indians. I think we all agree that was pretty unjust, but we wouldn't all be here without it."
"But it didn't directly replace Chiller because that was out of commission long before TDK came along and awesome as Chiller was, it was very unreliable."
