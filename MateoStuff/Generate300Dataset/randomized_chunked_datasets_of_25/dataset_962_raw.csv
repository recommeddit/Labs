I find so many that enjoy boardgames and similar hobbies who have never heard of it. Its just plain odd honestly.
I had to fight my SO to paint some of the walls in our house... Off white walls with white blinds were his only acceptable look. We have one accent wall and the bedrooms are light versions of colors.
Man...I can smell that room from here.
"I liked this one, but I found it to get a bit dry nearing the end. What did you think?"
"That's my secret, I'm always hungover"
Agreed!
"Might be really late for this but thank you for this great list, you did what like other 10 threads failed to do."
When's your mixtape dropping?
"That worked? My wife felt the need to clean before the maid arrived, ""So she doesn't know how dirty the house gets!"" It was a huge stressful thing.

I clean the house instead."
I’m using Zebra almost full time now instead of Cydia. One con for Zebra is the lack of a user/expert filter for installed packages.
"I recommend the following: 
Fire/red/leafgreen (can be played on DS lite), followed by heartgold/soulsilver, platinum, emerald (original), followed by the other pokemon games in order of release (Black/white, black/white2)

If you don't want to jump between graphics of newer/older games move emerald (original) to immediately after firered/leafgreen 

Honestly, I absolutely adore Gen 1-4 and I would STRONGLY recommend for any pokemon fan to experience Gen 1-4 
A lot of people say Gen 5 has the best story but Gen 5 is my probably least fav. gen and I really hated the pokemon designs of this gen. It was the only gen where I hated the starter pokemon (but I will admit the story is interesting and the game has a good difficulty level)

Gen 6 (X/Y) felt weak to me and story was too short, the game was too easy, the evil team lacked any charm to make them memorable. Honestly, you could completely skip this gen and it would make zero difference but if your a hardcore fan, you'll probably still come back to play X/Y...actually, looking at everything as a whole, I would rank Gen 6 as the lowest, and Gen 5 slightly above it for having an engaging story and large amount of post-game content 

Final note: it would probably be really difficult to get your hands on a legit copy of firered/leafgreen and emerald now so BEWARE OF FAKE GAMES 

EDIT: If you can't get your hands on firered/leafgreen/emerald immediately, start with platnium. You can also play heartgold/soulsilver BUT won't understand all the references without playing Gen 1 (firered/leafgreen)"
"It makes sense for Washington, considering Spokane is around 45 minutes away from Silverwood. Idaho is pretty interesting. The CDA area is obviously searched more for Silverwood, but Boise is pretty split. SE Idaho which includes Pocatello and Idaho Falls areas is definitely Lagoon considering it’s like 3 hours away"
I can confirm that Tommy Lee Jones is a prick.
"> best ramen north of LA

What other ramen places have you sampled between SB and Los Angeles? If I was travelling to Northridge and wanted to get ramen between here and there can you suggest two or three places to try?"
When Mino Monsters 2 came out they removed the first one seemingly abruptly. I enjoy 2 but I love the original and am sad I can't play it anymore.
"Whites mountains in NH/Maine or the adirondacks in upstate NY, both have dozens and dozens of incredible hikes/views."
audio books always non-fictin. workout the mind and body at the same time
well I’m going to give myself another chance haha. I’ll admit the first time I tried to watch True Detective season 1 I got so confused 🤷‍♂️ but now I watch things with subtitles and it makes me paying attention a lot easier.
"He means it’s mostly inconsequential as there are very few valid reasons to have images in excel sheets (I know, you do it and you think it’s useful, more power to you. It’s still irrelevant in a spreadsheet software)"
"All the information on this thread is incredible and extremely useful, so up to date. Please feel free to vote up this thread to make it more searchable on Google :)"
[The Richard Simmons one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRrvPpZtqIU) still kills me every single time
"Cool, thanks for the pic. 

And no worries, my desk is usually packed with stuff too."
"Is the one about the running still on there? The Barkley Marathons it's called I think. Maybe not the best, but the first I thought of. It was super refreshing and fun, for a topic that didn't really interest me before."
Wow I cant believe people taste differences in bottle water... all water kind of seems the same to me so I mostly just use the tap.
"> Enjoy my friend.
