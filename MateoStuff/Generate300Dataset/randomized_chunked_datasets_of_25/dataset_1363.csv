30153,best Mexican war to study,"Well, I think he had some pretty good generals. 

But many of them fucking *hated* Santa Ana.  He was an asshole.  Like an epic-level asshole. He humiliated whenever he had a chance, and was careless in the expenditure of his troops’ lives.  

This pissed off a lot of them.  It’s no wonder they only half-heartedly fought for him.  And when he took off, they wasted no time writing a bunch of really bad shit about Santa Ana - a lot of it was just malarkey to make him look bad.  

But Santa Ana was guy who used to brag and brag about how he made his own troops suffer; and there was plenty of evidence to believe *that*. 

It just goes to show you: being a good military leader isn’t just about understanding strategy and tactics.  It’s also about being a good listener and treating your troops well...or at least not treat them as “so many chickens” as he was purported to have said in a room full of his generals.  

If it weren’t for the fact that the guy pussed out and signed over Texas in exchange for his life, bankrupted the Mexican treasury, and set off two centuries of socio-political instability, he’d probably be remembered for being a pretty good general.  

But Santa Ana just could get past being “Santa Ana.”"

41061,best instrument to play,"If we're comparing like for like, surely the piano. You can probably learn ""Twinkle twinkle little star"" with one hand on the piano in less time than it takes to learn how to get sound from a clarinet.

But because it's so easy, the expectations are higher: A piano player is not only expected to play a single tune like most other instruments, but also to provide any additional voices, a bass line, and their own accompaniment. That's what makes it hard, you're basically doing the job of what would take four people in a string quartet all on your own.

Other contenders for easiest instrument:

* Recorder: Very simple to make sound; unlike most other wind instruments there's no special trick to it, just blow. No extra keywork to learn. Simple and fairly logical fingering in the first octave. But in the upper register it's less easy: Inconsistent fingering that bears little resemblance to the lower register, half-holing the thumb hole with a gap that needs to vary in size depending on which note you want, and you need to carefully calibrate the breath pressure to avoid squeaking (took me a couple of months to learn as an adult).
* Guitar: Simple to learn a few chords and sing along. Very simple to transpose in semitone steps (with a capo). But if you want to play the guitar like a piano, with melody and accompaniment at the same time, it's harder than piano.

You can appoint an ""easiest"" instrument only by arbitrarily restricting the comparison: Easiest learning to play the ""twinkle, twinkle"" melody in C major? Piano and recorder are close, I guess a few minutes for both, but I think piano wins from the visual feedback. (Hardest is probably fretless string instruments like violin, going from zero to an in-tune ""twinkle, twinkle"" could take months.) 

Easiest to transpose by a semitone? Guitar wins by a mile. 

Easiest to transpose by an octave? Piano, no contest. 

Easiest to learn to play the melody _and_ the accompaniment? Not all that easy on piano (i.e. it will take more than a few minutes), but for recorder or clarinet it's impossible, and while the guitar can do it it's harder to understand what you are doing, so piano wins.

But if you want to play at expert level, it's going to be hard with any instrument. Simply because experts have spent years practicing, and if playing a basic melody is too simple they'll add complexity elsewhere.
 
I have played piano and guitar (a few years), recorder (a few months), and clarinet (a week), so I have primarily commented on the instruments I've actually played."

12703,best gifts for mom,"I'm gonna temper the recommendation of the bath stuff for your average mom. I'm 29 and I have yet to get through a Christmas without at least 2 bath items coming my way. Unless a person's mom is ALL ABOUT BATH STUFF (in which case hit up Lush), go easy on the bath stuff. 

And if a person simply MUST give in to the temptation to give a woman bath items, at least try to think about their smell palate. Woody vs fruity vs gourmand etc. Don't just whip into Bath and Body Works and grab the sparkliest stinkiest thing in sight; think about it a little bit."
