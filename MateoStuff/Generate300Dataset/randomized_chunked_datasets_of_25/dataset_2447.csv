72550,best keyboard switches,"Are blacks your preference? I know they are heavier than the others, but what googles tells me is most membrane keyboards have about the same or heavier actuation point anyway (60+g). This would be my first mech keyboard buy so I'm a little nervous, I don't really want to go down the rabbit hole of buying a ton of different switches :P"

Look at how many times Ubuntu or another flavor of Ubuntu is mentioned in this thread. Just go to the source; you don't yet know why you may prefer a different flavor and support will be easier with vanilla."

8721,best toothpaste,I had bad oral hygiene for a while because of depression. I have more sensitivity now at a young age because of it. Is it really possible that using flouride toothpaste or an enamel restoring toothpaste like sensodyne can restore the enamel I destroyed? Can restoring enamel help with the discoloration?

45264,best gaming system,"I think it depends mostly on the type of games you like to play. 

Nintendo has a very specific style, so if you think you'd like solid gameplay in cartoon fashion with often a less-serious tone, as well as couch co-op, then the Switch may be the way to go. It has a ton of great exclusive franchises like Mario, Splatoon, Zelda, Pokemon, etc. but doesn't have a ton of major AAA releases though because of its much more limited processing capabilities. A Switch will also give you a good degree of mobility, if that factors into your decision at all. Also, in my personal opinion, the joycon controllers absolutely suck. Theyre very uncomfortable for any extended period of time (I'm talking like an hour) and are way too small. But you could always get a Pro controller which is more like an Xbox or Playstation one. 

The Xbox is a great console, especially the One X if you have a 4K HDR TV (or even if you dont, everything still runs and looks better just not as good as it could). It is definitely the 'best' way to play third-party titles. Gamepass and EA Access also have large libraries of great games for a monthly fee if you wanted access to a bunch of games right off the bat those are both exclusive to Xbox. It supports a ton of backward compatibility as well, if you wanted to try out any games from the Xbox 360 or even original Xbox generations. That being said, it's first party library is severely lacking which I will go into more in a second. As far as an overall entertainment device, I think the Xbox is a superior console to the Playstation. Purely for gaming though, that may be a different story. I also prefer the Xbox controller to the Playstation one, and the Xbox Elite controller (although pricey) is by far the best controller ever made in my opinion. 

You'll want to get a Playstation 4 if you are most interested in its story-driven first party exclusives, because there are a wealth of amazing titles you can only play on Playstation. Namely The Last of Us, the Uncharted series, Spiderman, God of War, Until Dawn, Infamous, Horizon Zero Dawn, and more. Sony is absolutely killing the exclusivity game right now. It can also do pretty much everything the Xbox can, although I personally like the way Microsoft does things better. There is also a game subscription service like Xbox Gamepass but I don't think the games are as good overall.

These are my personal opinions so take them with a grain of salt, but I do own all three and have been a gamer most of my life. Hope this helped!"
