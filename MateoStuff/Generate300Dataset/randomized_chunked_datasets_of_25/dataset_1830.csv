42878,"I FULLY UNDERSTAND the request here, and I normally would not suggest this given what you are asking but I fully recommend watching Dark. It may tell a sci-fi story, but god damn does it have some of the best acting and drama a Netflix show can have. 

I highly suggest giving it a shot despite the general story being based around time travel. Plenty of real world mystery and thrills to go along with the sci-fi nature of the show imo.",best detective show

I know you're just commenting on these players because they mentioned them, but it's worth noting that all of these (except Phillips) didn't get called up, so their value is irrelevant for the graphic regardless",best soccer team in the world

28382,"Once you have steel cut or quick 1 minute whole grain oats, you can never go back to the instant oatmeal in the packets. Instant is disgustingly mushy and smooth, like baby oatmeal. Also, way too sweet!

1/2 cup oatmeal, 1 cup milk and 1 Tb. brown sugar mixed in a coffee mug doesn't look like a lot, but it will fill you up for several hours. If I eat this before I leave the house, I'm not even hungry at first break at work (9AM).",best breakfast foods

Plants vs Zombies 1

I play a few more here and there, but after quitting Hearthstone a year ago these are the games I keep coming back to. I guess I like mild strategy without crazy difficulty. 

I was excited to purchase Slay the Spire when it released, but quickly realized that after 100+ hours on PC I was a little burned out and the iOS controls were too slow for the pace I’d gotten used to. Same thing happened with FTL. As a casual player, it can be surprising how much reducing moves per minute can slow a game down to a crawl. Even using a mouse on the iPad doesn’t compare to a computer. If I’d started these games on iOS, I’d probably still be hooked on them. 

Not sure why I explained all that, but there it is.",best iOS game
