For 2-3 years I would say go for the XR, but if you want it to last until 2024 or 2025 then I say don't.  
The phone was released in 2018, so in 2024 it will be 6 years old, that's super outdated. Just for example, the iPhone 6 is 6 years old now and iPhone 5S is 7. I would either go for a newer model or get the XR but lower my expectations.",best iPhone
