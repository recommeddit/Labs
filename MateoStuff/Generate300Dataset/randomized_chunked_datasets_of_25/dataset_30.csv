Perfect for camping and if the power goes out as well."

7286,best iPhone,"> I want to use a phone for 4-5 years. 

For 2-3 years I would say go for the XR, but if you want it to last until 2024 or 2025 then I say don't.  
The phone was released in 2018, so in 2024 it will be 6 years old, that's super outdated. Just for example, the iPhone 6 is 6 years old now and iPhone 5S is 7. I would either go for a newer model or get the XR but lower my expectations."
2988,best webcamera,This is also pretty much why TV speakers and AAA video games have been getting progressively worse over the years. :p

64163,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,That's really smart! I've noticed it getting more difficult to find things in both my music and book libraries - I'll try something similar; it's a little like sub-libraries :D
