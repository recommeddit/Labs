31948,"I am a former Starwood Platinum...  While I have never had Hyatt or Marriott status, I have had HHonors Diamond and am currently IHG Platinum. I find that SPG's Platinum bests Hilton and IHG top-tiers for perks and recognition.  SPG has also added new perks for high-volume plats like anytime check-in and a few confirmable suite upgrades, as well as lifetime gold and platinum tiers.

I am currently going for lifetime gold but it taking longer than I had hoped, partially due to less travel than anticipated but also the miniscule number of SPG properties compared to other chains. It seems like most markets have a tons of IHG, Marriott, and Hilton properties with a couple SPG hotels and even fewer Hyatts.",best hotel to live in

Costs are about equal to the average tuition for any other private U.S. college, but you only have to pay for it if you end up deciding not to be a priest. You also have to be debt free in most cases before you enter the seminary",best major to study in college
