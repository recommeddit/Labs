31948,best hotel to live in,"I am a former Starwood Platinum...  While I have never had Hyatt or Marriott status, I have had HHonors Diamond and am currently IHG Platinum. I find that SPG's Platinum bests Hilton and IHG top-tiers for perks and recognition.  SPG has also added new perks for high-volume plats like anytime check-in and a few confirmable suite upgrades, as well as lifetime gold and platinum tiers.

I am currently going for lifetime gold but it taking longer than I had hoped, partially due to less travel than anticipated but also the miniscule number of SPG properties compared to other chains. It seems like most markets have a tons of IHG, Marriott, and Hilton properties with a couple SPG hotels and even fewer Hyatts."

69655,best major to study in college,"I ultimately didn't end up going to seminary, but seminary studies are typically covered by the diocese (a bishop has to sign off before you enter the seminary). Costs are about equal to the average tuition for any other private U.S. college, but you only have to pay for it if you end up deciding not to be a priest. You also have to be debt free in most cases before you enter the seminary"

37542,best amusement park,"My friend my point was that Cedar Point’s three 200-300 footers are all very different and have different design goals, whereas Steel Phantom and Steel Curtain were both made to be record breaking looping coasters over 200 feet and breaking/matching the us inversion record.

CP= not the same
Kennywood = kind of the same"
41895,movies like Inception,""" Mr. Nobody""! Please, it's so underappreciated and I try to share it whenever the context is right. Hopefully it's still on Netflix. It's a slice of life movie revolving around the butterfly effect. It's very detailed plotwise like Inception meaning you won't know what the hell is going on unless you watch it from the beginning"
