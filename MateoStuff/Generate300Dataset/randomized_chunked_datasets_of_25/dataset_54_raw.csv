"For this to work, I'd suggest averaging only the top 3 or top 4 of each park. Take Canada's Wonderland, for example. 17 coasters, but only a couple that stand out. But then you have Holiday World with five coasters and The Voyage."
Not bad!
"I wouldn't say that they 'go downhill' as much as they continue on that 'way out there' path.  There were some seriously cerebral moments/ideas in the following books, that were poorly mirrored in the Son's prequel books, but I still ate them all up."
"Didn't like TDU 2 as much as TDU 1, but for me TDU 1 still holds up as a decent game.

Had exactly the progression I wanted and it was pretty difficult back in the day when I had little experience with racing games."
"I am so with you on this. Strangely, I had just looked in the freezer shortly before I logged on and found this thread, and someone has eaten all of two flavors out of the carton and left one!! Whoooo does THAT??!!! So frustrating."
"The Punic War's, specifically The second Punic War. Hannibal is just so amazing, one of the greatest General's ever. At Cannae he faced 85,000 Roman's with only 50,000 soldiers and came out on top, 50,000 dead Romans and only 5000 dead In all of Hannibal's forces."
"LG GL83A-B, basically a GL850-B without USB hub & wide color gamut but quite cheaper."
Voss horrible taste
Just messing with you. Lol. Look it up please.
"Adderall is the best energy drink! Right next to, Vermonster"
"[The Market For Lemons](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=hkaigWlUSsoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA201&dq=The+market+for+lemons&ots=7VwqleIJ7Q&sig=4K7gJlMue3po82ZLdCaGgLEuJy8#v=onepage&q=The%20market%20for%20lemons&f=false), by George Akerlof. Decades of people taking shots at the neoclassical economy building unsuccesfully, and this guy comes along with the simplest example and tears it down easily. He got a Nobel for it, too."
“zebra won’t fail you” why does it mismatch dependencies for multiple tweaks then
"Sega Genesis: Sonic 2

"The Adirondaks are the raddest, most accessible mountains coming from NYC. Really amazing place, and a HUGE area. Things get a little more wild in New Hampshire and Maine, but the Daks are spectacular."
it’s more of a sim right?
"Depends on what genres of music you like best.  Keyboards and pianos are out of the question if you're into rock, for the most part.  Bass is easier to learn than guitar due to the lack of chords you'll be playing, but guitars are smaller and might feel more comfortable.

I started with a keyboard, graduated to the guitar and then drums.  Bass came naturally after I learned guitar.

Learn by ear.  Fuck learning by reading sheet music, it's useless as fuck.  Write your own songs, don't play covers. 100% of cover bands are fucking horrid and so unoriginal that they make me want to vomit. You can't fuck up songs that *you* wrote."

"For RPG’s, I would highly recommend The Witcher 3. Not everyone’s cup of tea but give it a couple of hours and you will feel the immersion. It will however take a lot of your time.
For JRPG’s, there are plenty starting off with Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Persona 5, Star Ocean, and Tales of."
"I was just using that as a general term for ""shit that goes on your brush"" I think gel is fine."
What's wrong with continuing using request?
Do you support the US marines?
Le Labo’s Another 13.
"Specifically, buy wool socks like Darn Tough or Smartwool. They don't smell or become useless if they get wet."
"Act has fluoride, while the standard Listerine and whatnot don't. Basically it's easier to just say ""go buy Act"" instead of saying ""go buy Scope or Listerine, but not the normal kind, but the one with the label that has fluoride"""
"Literally finished this one an hour ago. Moana deserves more love, it was overall a great film."
