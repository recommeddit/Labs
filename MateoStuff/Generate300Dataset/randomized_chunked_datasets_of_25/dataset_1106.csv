3870,"I don't have an online degree, but I did take 13 courses from a distance ed university (AthabascaU in Canada), mostly for medical school pre-requisites. 

Pros: very flexible, if you are really motivated, you can get through the coursework much faster than at a brick-and-mortar school. I finished a German course in 10 days. It allowed me to work 20-30 hours a week with a lot less stress - not commuting and parking like 1.5 miles from the lecture hall several times a week saves you a lot of time and energy. 

Cons: if you don't have your shit together, you will fail HARD because no one's holding your hand. At a lab session, I met someone who wanted to go to vet school and was taking a few courses to meet her pre-reqs. She was late with every single assignment for no reason - she told me she had done them all, but just didn't submit them. She then didn't submit the lab reports within the one-month deadline and failed the course. She tried to appeal, but the university basically told her she knew full well what the expectations were. 
Edit: another big con is social isolation",best online college
10841,"ELI5 (Never been through an American airport).. Why do they open your luggage when you're not there? Any baggage you take on the plane have to go through that a scanner, along with your belt and such, and you have a luggage inspection when you arrive at your destination.. why would there be a need for TSA to go through your luggage in between these two inspections?
