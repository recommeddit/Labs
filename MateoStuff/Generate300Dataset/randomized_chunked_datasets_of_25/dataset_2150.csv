38616,"Any of the broadsheets are worth reading. Of course the Guardian and Indy tend to be more liberal and the Times & Telegraph more conservative but they all feature intelligent editorials, a good range of commenters and a variety of news both national and international.

If I can make one suggestion -- try not to read solely the newspaper whose political views best align with your own. By reading the Telegraph if you're a natural lefty, or the Guardian if you're more right-wing, you're going to get a much more rounded perspective on events than if you purely stick to media you agree with.",best newspapers to read

65633,"If you have decent Sprint service, Kickstart isn't bad - unlimited data for $25/month and usually another $5 or so for taxes/fees.  Obviously the concerns there are the quality of Sprint coverage in some areas and phone compatibility, along with what will happen to the plan in the distant future if Sprint and T-Mobile do merge.

If you have an iPhone or a few select Android phones, Visible may be the way to go - $40 for unlimited on Verizon with hotspot (but speed-limited to 5Mbps).  They're owned by Verizon and a relatively new service, so it has both the pros and cons of something really new and finding its way.

Next, Cricket is owned by AT&T and uses their network.  They have two unlimited plans: $55 ($50 with autopay) for Unlimited, but speed capped to 3Mbps and $60 ($55 with autopay) for Unlimited Extra, but deprioritized (no speed cap).  Both have pros and cons and searches around here and /r/cricketwireless should help.  For what it's worth, I'm on the cheaper one with a group discount and it's really only noticeable under certain circumstances like app updates over cellular.  In many areas, AT&T's network is pretty consistent, so that's a good tradeoff for speed bragging rights.

AT&T Prepaid has two unlimited plans, too: $65 ($55 with autopay) gets you unlimited, but deprioritized data like Cricket Unlimited Extra), and $85 (75 with autopay) get you data with 22GB until deprioritization, the ability to turn on HD video, and 10GB hotspot.  Almost every other unlimited plan throttled video to ""SD quality.""

Metro has a $50 unlimited plan, too, but they're owned by T-Mobile and use their network, so if you're unhappy with T-Mobile, this may be more of the same.

These are by no means exhaustive, but hopefully a starting point.  How much data do you use?  There's a lot of 8-10GB plans that may also be worthwhile if you don't really need unlimited.",best phone service company

I still recall getting to know Apple when I bought my first PowerBook back in 2002. As I started gathering apps I had fear about the walled garden I had heard of and indeed I saw the options were limited where Windows seemed endless... then as I found the bits I needed and located most of what I wanted, the fear eased.",best iPhone

60288,"As far as brands I'd go with sub zero, but that's $$$$. I can't say any other brand is better than frigidaire other than sub zero. I assume you're in the US and if so, they may be pulling your leg on when they can get the freezer in, but good luck. As far as chest freezers, the inside skins are very thin and the lines the freon run through are right there. It is very likely that throwing a frozen package of meat caused a small leak... about as likely that it came leaking from the factory (small leaks can take months before you notice a loss of performance).

As for brands, I carry GE, Frigidaire, Beko, and Speed Queen. Don't think Beko has any freezers but Speed Queen definitely does not. I have yet to experience an issue on any I've sold.",best freezer brand
