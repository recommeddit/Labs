32106,"Not a woman, but I have to chime in on this one...

Back when I was a kid, my family used to stay in Atlantic City a lot. My grandparents were pretty regular gamblers, and so they always got the invitations to come back ""for free"" and obviously spend more money ha. One of their favorites was Caesar's.

But one time, we were running many hours late and told them about it on the way. ""Sure, no problem, we'll hold your room!""

So we get there, and they had given it away. With absolutely zero normal rooms, or even suites left to give us, they only had *one* option. The emperor's suite. Holy crap, it was awesome... There was a small gym, a big fancy glass table, less of a dining table and more of a ""small conference table"", two (or three?) large rooms. The damn thing was practically a luxury apartment on its own!

And all because they mistakenly gave our regular room away! It was epic.

I actually just looked up some videos of it on YouTube, and I'm not sure how many of them they have. I distinctly remember the layout being different than in the videos, and the whole suite much larger. Maybe I was just a lot smaller? :)",best hotel to live in
