71958,best movies with a cool twist,"Not a movie but The Good Place has some fantastic twists.

Also the Truman Show has one of the most disturbing twists ever. 

Most Nolan movies get pretty twisty and most people like The Prestige but I always found Memento's twist better."

Possibly my favorite detective thriller ever."
27492,best bollywood actor,Yeah but method acting means you would know the irl characteristics of the character and would try to be accurate to them
31268,best country to live in,Or you could get a job??
28,best terminal file manager reddit,"At some point even I thought that I am more than good with running the utilities and working iteratively e.g.

- run grep, copy the first file path in the list (select and middle paste) and edit... then go back to the second
- cd, ls, vi OR run command with fish/zsh shell's TAB/auto completion... cd...

ranger changed my outlook towards content visibility as I could see the complete directory at once and just go to the file, hover and work with it.

Found nnn much later. The first thing that hooked me was the filtered navigation mode (just type the partial names to automatically cd or filter out a file). zsh has something similar but nnn's implementation is somehow instant even with 1000s of files in /usr/bin. Also, the matches are visible nicely sorted. Later I explored more and found several useful features. Speaking of the above 2 use cases - nnn makes these workflows look absolutely trivial. The first one is covered by find & list (you always have the list of results with you) and the second one by continuous filtered navigation."

35383,best alcoholic drink,"Pink Panty Droppers. Dump a bag of ice, 24 Lite beers, a 5th of vodka, and some pink lemonade mix into a Gatorade cooler. It just tastes like slightly fizzy pink lemonade. You can't really taste the beer or the vodka. A batch of these things will kick a party into overdrive."
