28,"At some point even I thought that I am more than good with running the utilities and working iteratively e.g.

- run grep, copy the first file path in the list (select and middle paste) and edit... then go back to the second
- cd, ls, vi OR run command with fish/zsh shell's TAB/auto completion... cd...

ranger changed my outlook towards content visibility as I could see the complete directory at once and just go to the file, hover and work with it.

Found nnn much later. The first thing that hooked me was the filtered navigation mode (just type the partial names to automatically cd or filter out a file). zsh has something similar but nnn's implementation is somehow instant even with 1000s of files in /usr/bin. Also, the matches are visible nicely sorted. Later I explored more and found several useful features. Speaking of the above 2 use cases - nnn makes these workflows look absolutely trivial. The first one is covered by find & list (you always have the list of results with you) and the second one by continuous filtered navigation.",best terminal file manager reddit
