31355,"Well its not like theres much else to compare education. Its not like you can compare countries for english comprehension when they dont speak english or compare them for knowledge of italian history when they arent italy. 

Science and math are universal, so are probably the best measure for comparing education.",best country to live in
15559,"Another tip for planting any fruit tree to deter deer, make cages around the trees. That is what I helped my friend with. The cages though have to be tough enough to stand up to some bastard deer that wants food. Also we put a ring around the trees with fishing line. From experience growing other stuff outdoors, fishing line seems to freak deers out.",best tree for the garden
22481,"Bill Nye. Horrible. I took a group of high school students to an engineering fair at University of Illinois in 2001. Bill was a special guest. This was a big deal for one of my students as he was the inspiration to pursue science. My student made a t-shirt that she wanted to get signed by him if she got the chance. We drove four hours to get there, walked around and viewed the projects that were on display, and watched some battle bot competitions. On our last walk through, here comes Bill down the hallway. I nudged my student to go ask for an autograph. She told him that he was a huge inspiration and asked if he would sign her shirt. He said that he did not appreciate that she was interrupting his walk. She showed him the shirt. He rolled his eyes, scribbled on the shirt, and tossed it to her. She looked like she was going to cry. Instead she walked over to a garbage can and threw it away. He said, ""Whatever"" and went back to looking at the projects.",best celebrity

Waited on Gene Wilder for his birthday years ago, he was incredibly nice and laughed so hard he cried when I told him we had ‚Äúeverlasting pistachio‚Äù ice cream.

Betty White was hilarious and tipsy after wine and would not stop flirting. If I had been 60 years older...

NPH was also gracious as humanly possibly, insisted we have a drink with his table while we waited on him, and tipped like a champ.

Seth MacFarlane was amazing. Drew me an original cartoon and signed it there at the table. After paying and tipping 100% he refused to let me buy him a shot of whiskey and instead bought me one, then invited us to meet him out later.",best celebrity

68710,"It is hard going until you start figuring out what some of the concept words mean, but once you get a glimpse of what's going on it really takes off.

The problem is that what's going on is at first really confusing both to the reader and the main character, because there are major gaps in both his and our knowledge of the world and plotline... which works to help us understand the problem the main character is dealing with but is also kind of unpleasant for both us and him until it starts getting untangled a bit.",best science fiction novel
