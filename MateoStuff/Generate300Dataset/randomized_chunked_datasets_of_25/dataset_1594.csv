5190,best home improvement store,"Return policy: ONLY if you have the card.  I've been screwed in the past by something I bought from them that I know for a fact Lowe's would have taken back.  It was beyond the 30 day period, but, as I said, Lowe's beats them hands down.  I appreciate your feedback and comment, thanks!"

3071,best webcamera,"The only technology that’s really getting better is semiconductors, which explains the computers and amps. Outside of this though most things are stagnant or progress very slowly. Technology only gets better in very specific and niche ways, but not in the sense that every aspect of it improves, some things just kinda get stuck."
33564,best electric car,"u/Bojarow is pretty knowledgeable and objective in my view. Mostly sticks to interesting tidbits of info that others miss, and clarifying things. Strong member of the sub for sure. Do they have a bias against Tesla? Maybe, I'm not the final word on anything, but nothing imo worth getting upset about and certainly not in a toxic way.

If you read my history you'll probably think I'm some anti-Tesla type too. And maybe I am, who knows. I personally think Elon is a lunatic and there's a small but vocal minority of Tesla fans online that make it difficult to have normal discussions. I also think Tesla does some really cool stuff and I'm very glad they exist and are pushing EVs forward in their own way. I'll never forget the first time I drove one - I was grinning ear to ear for a week (and I used to ride motorcycles and had a BMW, so I'm vaguely familiar with speed). I just don't let that singular experience result in unquestioning loyalty.

I think we're all a lot more alike than different and we all want to see more BEV and less ICE. Cheers."
