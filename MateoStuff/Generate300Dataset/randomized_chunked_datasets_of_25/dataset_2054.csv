13227,"The absolute best shower gift I got was from a couple of girlfriends of mine. They got me a gift certificate for a massage/soak at a local wellness center, and they both came over to the house, watched the baby, and gave my house a good cleaning. It was amazing. 17 years later, and that's the gift I remember the most. If she doesn't have anyone that she trusts with the baby, you can watch her/him while your wife goes out, and hire a housecleaner to come in for a couple of hours. If my husband did that for me, even today, as a full-time student and mom of teenagers and tweens, I would be over the moon!",best gifts for mom

31157,"Someone recently expressed to me that Eastern European cities tend to be very clean, and it may be a cultural thing. I was surprised to hear it too, but maybe that's the reason?

Anyway, in the U.S. we have plenty of pee, trash, and homeless, so I'm curious to see how DK compares in that regard.

Before I went to Prague a couple of years ago I read a blog from a European visitor who called it dirty. Then I got there and it was vastly cleaner than anything we have in the U.S. So I did somewhat develop the idea that this concept is relative.",best country to live in

72763,"The Logitech G305 might work. It's great in fingertip and wireless. If you swap the AA battery for a AAA lithium with a converter you can get it to around 84 grams and still get around 2 months of play form one battery.   


I searched for G Pro Wireless prices in Aus and the lowest historical price I saw was around  $165 so that may be an option too. If you take out the bottom plate on that you can get it to 77g. 

Unless the Razer Viper Ultimate goes down in price, those are pretty much the only solid wireless options at the moment.",best wireless lightweight mouse

Annual Winnings: 

FC Barcelona: **8**  ('12-13, '10-11, '09-10, '08-09, '05-06, '04-05, '98-99, and '97-98)

Real Madrid: **7** ('11–12, '07–08, '06–07, '02–03, '00–01, '96–97, and 94'-95)

Atletico: **2** ('13–14, and '95–96) 

This pretty much knocks out Atletico. 



Obviously, Madrid and Barcelona are pretty much even, but for a newcomer to football, I'd say Barcelona has been more relevant in recent years.",best soccer team in the world
