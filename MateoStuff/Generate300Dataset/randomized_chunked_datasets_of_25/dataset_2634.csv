One guy made a Spotify playlist of them all.  He got gilded 7 times.  The next day he trolled everyone by changing the entire playlist to just loop the Friends theme 20 times.

52753,"Opinions are subjective. I’m not saying any one album is missing. 
I’m saying all of the answers on here are “old head” answers from back in the day. These are answers people use to try to sound like a hip hop head. 

You can’t honestly tell me nothing in the 2005-present shouldn’t  go on here.

47574,"Utah is a GREAT winter destination. This past winter I was there and the Cottonwoods were getting 1+ feet of snow pretty much every day and Moab was like 80-85 during the day. Most days in SLC were in the 50s except the two days where it snowed quite a bit.

Brighton, Solitude, Snowbird, and Alta get amazing snow in the winter. Park City, Powder Mountain, Deer Valley, and other resorts near SLC typically get less snow fall but it can vary from storm to storm. If you stay in SLC it's not a big deal because they're all pretty close and can chase the powder if that's your thing.

The southern part of the state is extremely impressive. Arches and Canyonlands are substantially more impressive in person. You see a picture and you're like ""yeah that looks cool."" And then you go and you don't say a damn thing because you don't even know what to say. Zion is ridiculous.

Utah is, IMO, the most underrated state. It gets a bad rap because of the Mormon thing. When I've been there I've never had a problem with enjoying myself and the Mormon inspired things (like beer dispenses from taps must be 4% or less, otherwise the bar has to serve it from a bottle or can) are mostly just background noise or minor inconveniences.",best state to visit in the United States

3376,"I spent in total 100 dollars for my stream setup. Most expensive part was my elgato stream deck that was 60, I bought a logitech webcam and mic for the other 40. If you fool around with the settings, and using a lamp pointed at your face, the image can look super crisp with a cheap webcam. It's not dslr quality but it gets pretty close. I haven't had any complaints about my face cam quality so far from viewers either so it must be passable ☺️!",best webcamera
