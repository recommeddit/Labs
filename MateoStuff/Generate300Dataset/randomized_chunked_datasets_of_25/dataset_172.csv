This morning, I woke up around 7:30am and first thing I did was check and it was being sold by Amazon for $599 and it said there was like 10 left.

Chad Michael Murray & Lee Norris

My brother went out for drinks with them cause he was friends with a friend of Lee’s (minkus from boy meets world). Said Chad was a douche that held them up changing his jeans 5 times. Lee was sweet and surprisingly charming

Terri Hatcher

Got a hair cut from a guy who was a stylist at the Sundance Film Festival (had a binder of pics for proof) and he said that Terri was a heinous bitch

Bush Twins

Brother’s friend went to their birthday party at the White House, brought black dildos as gag gifts. Security couldn’t stifle their giggles. He says that the Bush twins are “boss” and really genuine and with a raunchy sense of humor

Justin Timberlake

Know a girl that went to New York to visit friend who does interior design for celebrities. They all went to a very exclusive club. Girl got dared to go up to Justin and pinch him on the butt. She did it and ran away. Later, when he was leaving, he came up behind her, pinched her on the butt and whispered “nice move” and walked away",best celebrity

The hours are good, just early.  Earning potential is generally good but not amazing.  Timber markets can fluctuate very hard and make job security not the best, depending on who you work for.  I'd say just be absolutely sure you love working outside, rain or shine.  Days where you are working on a steep ass slope, crawling through thorny underbrush in the rain can be really taxing.  On the other hand, good days make it feel like you've got the best job in the world.",best major to study in college
