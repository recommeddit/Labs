9692,"So I lived in San Raf as a first year this year, and I'm staying for next year.

Pros:

* Close to IV and campus. You can get most places in 5-10 minutes walk.
* The suites (in the main building) are nice. One bathroom shared by 4-8 people, and you get a common room.
* No triples AFAIK. It's all singles or doubles.
* It's really quiet. Very few fire alarms or loud parties waking you up in the middle of the night.

Cons:

* The ""suites"" in the mountain/ocean cluster don't have a common room, but you still get a private bathroom.
* Physics/engineering classes are on the opposite side of campus so it's a bit of a commute (but still only 10-15 minute walk at most).
* There's not that many first years, it's dominated by sophomores/upperclassmen. In my experience it's definitely harder to make friends with people from a different year.
* You are pretty removed from first year life/culture. 90% of first years live in the other dorms, so you might find it hard to relate to their experiences.

Overall, I'd recommend it if you're not interested in party culture and want a more quiet/relaxed atmosphere. It's definitely still possible to have a social life and I've made some great friends here, but it won't revolve around partying.

As far as dining commons, honestly, all of them are pretty good. I usually go to Carillo since it's closest, but I often make the 10 minute walk to eat at DLG or Ortega if they have something really nice on the menu. DLG has tacos every day.",best dorm hall at UCSB

They walked right by our host, tried to seat themselves, got upset when told they couldn’t just sit wherever. Ended up going to the bar to sit, were rude the whole time and left 10%.

57588,"Came here to second any recommendations of Margiela’s Replica scents. I had been wearing Pac Sun for ages since a high school girlfriend got it for me. Tried Dior’s sauvage as a daily driver but it was too distractingly strong for me and I kept noticing when other guys would wear it around me and feel unoriginal. 

Finally took my girlfriend to Sephora this summer with some time to spare and had her pick out her favorite Margiela scents and a few others to try on me to see how she thought they would wear on me. Jazz club had caught my eye and she loved the idea of the Barber shop Replica but the one that won out was Music Festival Replica. It’s been my favorite daily driver for all of fall now. Check out the Margiela Replica line of scents. They hold their own.",best cologne

[POSSESSOR ](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5918982/)

Possessor was my favorite movie of 2020 and very similar to Inception, only way, waaaay darker. It’s about a shadow organization that takes over people’s bodies and uses them to commit assassinatons. Highly recommend this one, but heads up: nudity and GRAPHIC violence warning. If you decide to watch it, make sure it’s the uncut version. The title will specifically say “UNCUT.”",movies like Inception
