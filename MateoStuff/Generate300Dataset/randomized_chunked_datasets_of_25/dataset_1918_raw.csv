Good game but the repetitive music (especially same music during every battle) is very obnoxious.
"Lowes and Home Depot are literally across the street from each other where we live.  I usually opt for HD simply because I like orange more than blue, but I've been going to lowes more often lately for no apparent reason.  I now realize that I might be a little odd."
"I think this totally depends on the person. I thought I'd be like this, but after two babies I've realized that I'm less stressed when I can see the baby, at least first six months or so. If somebody else is holding, I can still relax and enjoy myself."

Tim Robbins plays a great villain. His character really makes me judge my new neighbors."
"Yeah I just got it. I never got an orangered from your reply? Anyway, im not being facetious, im serious! HAHA I was looking through some of your comments and your a super witty chick."
"Well I believe you can take both ibuprofen and acetaminophen every 6 hours, so I don't know if the 12 hours was just an example? I guess *technically* if you really needed something sooner, the mechanisms are different enough that it wouldn't harm you to take them both. But if you're having pain that's not relieved by the maximum allowed doses of OTC painkillers, that's probably an indication to see a doctor."
"No, cedar point‚Äôs just MiAdventure, but better"
"The entire album has too much clipping and really detracts from the experience if you have a good rip of the album and a decent set of headphones and speakers. Just listen to the intro verse from Rick Ross on Monster, that shit clips so bad.

"Spigen clear cases are the shit. It doesn't add much thickness to the iPhone SE, and I've dropped my phone a couple of times with no damage."
Bagpipes!
Sci-hub works surprisingly well for that.
"Ranbir Kapoor. Hands down - his performances have been great overall (not counting Sanju and a few others of course) and him not being on social media really adds to the mystique. He's the only 'star' from the lot; everyone has used social media and such to add to their brand. This man has built a brand with just his films, and yes some may argue his last name too, although I think he's outgrown that in the recent past. That man is really something."
"Pandora‚Äôs Star/Judas Unchained, Dune, Hyperion"
LOL. This is a totally valid answer!
"My favorite hotel is probably the Conrad in Tokyo, impeccable service."
