5041,best home improvement store,"Home Depot > Lowe's

HD is usually a little cheaper, has awesome cheap 5 gal buckets, and has 4 self checkouts + one register. Lowe's takes forever to get through checkout, usually only 1 or 2 registers open, rarely 3. Forget going to Lowe's on the weekend, it's a complete shit show. HD gets worse on weekends as well, but not Lowe's bad. This is of course my local stores, probably not a nation wide thing. 

Lowe's feels more like Sears + Hardware store  
HD feels more like a dedicated hardware store."

24240,best anime,"There is nothing inherently wrong with any particular list on your compilation, but don't you think your selection of list skew slightly more towards the older animes?

And I am saying this as an older anime fan. I was very surprised by how many early to mid 2000s anime that were in your list, and when I saw your selection of list, it all made sense.

A lot of these were written in the 2012, 2013, 2014 etc. Alot of the big 2010s anime haven't came out yet/barely made it cultural impact. There is even a list that was written in 2001.

A few one that I can name of that didn't make into your top 100 or were placed too low - Attack On Titan, One Punch Man, Jojo, Demon Slayer, Made Into Abyss, Haikyuu, My Hero Academia, Promised Neverland, Kaguyasama, Re:Zero, Sword Art Online. Note, this aren't my favourites, in fact I haven't even watched some of them, but clearly they had an impact in the anime industry / anime fandom."
69372,best major to study in college,"I would go back and not go.  I went before the sky high cost of college, but my job now only requires a GED and 6 months work experience.  I cap out at 135k after 15 years, with a pension after 25.  If I would have just been honest with myself that I hated school, and was not going to a white collar field I would have been better off."
9548,best toothpaste,"I had chronic canker sores until my 30s when it occurred to me that my toothpaste might be the issue. After some research, I learned to avoid SLS. What a life changer! The only time I've had a sore in the past three years is when my boyfriend bought a Toms toothpaste and neither of us read the ingredients, assuming it was safe. SLS free is not always easy to find, so I stockpile them when I find something good at marshalls, ross, etc. 

Jason's coconut toothpaste is my favorite, followed by Bronners cinnamon."

37557,best amusement park,"You’re lying right?

28930,best breakfast foods,"Nothing.  It is very easy to prepare.  It costs exactly nothing.  And it gives your cells time to engage autophagy, and regular autophagy will heal all kinds of problems.  It is the very simplest and easiest form of [intermittent fasting](/r/intermittentfasting)."

1117,best ice cream flavor,"Damn, so many possible answers. A really good black cherry or black raspberry is the best. But I love shiso leaf and multigrain flavored ice cream too. You can also never go wrong with classics like grasshopper pie/mint chocolate chip and strawberry cheesecake."

43635,best items under $100,prescription contact lens *edit*  didnt realise how many people would want to know where to order.  So far my fastest option is ordering from opticontacts.com   they will only take a week or less.  Lens.me is another option with more exotic brands but they take much longer to arrive as they ship out of dubia.   Neither will ask for prescription from doctor.  You just manually input your rx
