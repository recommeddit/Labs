"Nemo. 

Supports SMB/NFS/SFTP mounts with an addon, can split in half (F3) to easily compare, supports tabs, open folders as root, and even open my terminal to the folder I was currently in (You can set the default terminal that opens). 

I've used it for years, never needed anything else."
"A very limited selection of diversity because Jo Malone is the only brand I have bought myself in my life and I've tried a fair few ones in the range, but I definitely have preferences, in no particular order 

\- Wood Sage and Sea Salt. Very nice, musk and unisex scent, non offending. Smells good on its own for the short period it lasts but also very good for pairing.

\- Myrrh and Tonka. Amazing. Sweet, heady, aromatic and very pronounced notes of lavender but not overdone, a very sexually appealing smell and definitely unisex. Very good paired with something floral or citrus but smells incredible on its own and high impact.

\- Mimosa and Cardamom. Same as above, while it can be paired with something, it can definitely be worn solo because of how unique the smell is. Creamy, unusual and enveloping. Also unisex.

\- Amber and Lavender. I LOVE LOVE it. Strong, clean, soothing, sexy and soapy, like a posh barbershop. Another unisex scent, I would argue that while it is still feminine it is more leaning towards masculinity. This is one I would wear on it's own, but still good for layering.

\- White Moss and Snowdrop. A limited edition but a very unique and sophisticated scent, clean, dry cut and powdery. Despite the name leaning towards Winter this one can definitely be worn all year round. Yet again, unisex.

\- Wild Bluebell. Wouldn't be my complete favorite but very pleasant nonetheless, not hugely impactful but a beautiful, simply floral scent. Very good for pairing with a more heavy scent to give a lovely floral twist. 

\- English Pear and Freesia. Beautiful fruity scent, easy to wear and enjoyable and comforting.

\- Basil and Neroli. Very strong and unique, feminine but leaning more towards masculine, smells delicious.

\- Vetiver and Golden Vanilla. This one reminds me of Myrrh and Tonka a lot but is like a copy and paste version, very smoky and sharper. While it is unisex I would also argue this one is more leaning towards the masculine side.

\- Wild Fig and Cassis. Warm and sexy and delicious, very comforting and the fig note is very pronounced. A firm favorite with a high place on the list. 

Lmao I need to be more adventurous and try different brands for a change."
"So Intel refuses to put the Intel graphics card sticker on the laptop unless the laptop has dual channel RAM. My question is what is the difference between the graphics of a laptop running an 11th Gen Intel chip with single channel RAM vs dual channel RAM?

Is it significant? Is it something to look for when purchasing a laptop?"
"And on what basis you say this, can you point out any interview where he say this ?"
How big was your group? Got 12 of us going. We reserved at the El Cortez but looking to switch. Wondering about sleeping arrangements and whether we can book 3 rooms with 2 beds each or absolutely need to book 6 rooms? I read the El Cortez is strict with how many people stay in each room.
"I've been to great America, magic mountain, and discovery kingdom, and i put them all tied for sixth."

"Sometimes I pre-make a ton of breakfast burritos. Scrambled eggs, onion, green pepper, bacon, sausage, cheese, even potatoes - just depends what I have in the house. Put in tortillas, wrap in paper towel, wrap in tinfoil. Stick in the freezer. Then every morning microwave for a minute or so and boom. Delicious breakfast burrito. Also take the tinfoil off first lol"
"I don't really like social networking, for various reasons BUT.

Individuals in the industry use facebook as their storefront basically and can give you alot of information or updates on important topics.

Twitter is a must though. Devs on twitter are always linking useful things, new projects, you can interact directly with developers instead of through an e-mail wall or random facebook comment. The interaction and people you could meet on there is quite incredible. 

You do not need an online precense, you don't need to post your personal info on facebook or twitter or anywhere else. You could be a2 on twitter and never tweet once. But you can follow and read all of these developers. You are doing yourself a disservice by not having twitter IMO. It is ALOT to get going and maintain to begin with but pays off in the end IMO."
"81MM steel mortar case. flare gun. declare firearm when traveling by air. use heavy duty puck locks with hidden hasps (not master lock!) you keep key, no one else is legally allowed to open it, and it has to be done with you present. no TSA locks. period.

flare guns are legal in all 50 states but when flying must be checked as firearms. you don't even need flares.

re: http://deviating.net/firearms/packing/

includes lots of info, pictures of the mentioned mortar cases and locks. if you travel with some pricey gear, for gods sake get a [decent lock](https://securitysnobs.com/Abloy-Protec2-PL-975-Hardened-Steel-Puck-Padlock.html).

The Song of Achilles killed me! Such a great read. And it's wild how long Nora Roberts has been writing and still manages to stay relevant. Love her.
"neti pot to help flush away sinus pressure.  Use it a few time a day to speed healing.

Get some organic chicken legs (or conventional, just pushing my organic agenda).  Saute some celery, carrots, and onions. Put the chicken leg in.  Put some water in.  Boil it.  Maybe put some noodles in it.  There is stuff in chicken skin that actively fights colds.  

[Here](http://archives.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/diet.fitness/10/17/chicken.soup.reut/) is a shitty link.

Rest, cruise reddit and drink juice.  No gin."

Operation: Doomsday is my personal favorite.
"That depends on a few things, length of stay being a big one. But generally you could hope for anywhere between 10% and 40% off, depending on room type and demand. Larger hotels are generally more open to the idea and many will have arrangements with local colleges and businesses. Hope this helps"
"Is spartacus that complex? Been thinking about getting it and BGG says the weight of it is only ""2.7"" which is a weight I'm comfortable with..."
Yes it does . I just tried with Truestcuts which combine both tweaks.
