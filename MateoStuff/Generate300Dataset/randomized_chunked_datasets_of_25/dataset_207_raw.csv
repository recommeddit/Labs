"Best:  The ""bit-o-honey"" chews. Careful though, they'll rip out a filling. Oh, and those small Hershey chocolate bars.  

Worst: Fireballs.  As a kid, I just couldn't ever enjoy those, and I always seem to get a lot of them.  They slip down to the bottom of the bag, so you don't realize you got 50 of them until your stash is low."
"I recently recommended to my girlfriend that she get her parents a ""gift basket"" of sorts. Gourmet treats, drink mixes, self-made baking mixes, and the like."
Looking at a couple all inclusive resorts in Belize. Coco may Plum is on the top of the list. Anyone have any suggestions on that one?
"God Tier: An ergonomic Mouse, saving my wfh wrists.

Novelty: Wi-Fi enabled RGB lights (got a 4-pack for 45$ish). Absolutely useless, but my brain makes THE GOOD CHEMICAL when I can yell ""RED ALERT"" at google and make my lamps turn red."
"I think the answer depends on various factors and then it's still highly subjective.  I remember when Ray Bans cost less then $20, so it seems odd that anyone would pay $70+ for a pair today.  The increase in price is mostly due to the designer price tag, but I'm sure the quality is also much better today."
But Planetary is amazing....

"I’m talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo [cuckoo clock noise]"
I wore both Terre and Merveilles... It's amazing what they both do with orange.
Thomas was injured the majority of last year? Kamara is listed as the 5th best running back? Making this list in itself is impressive. This list has them as top 50 out of 1664 roster makers. That's high bro
"I have already tried Google Galendar, but I don't want to schedule, because my tasks don't come on regular basis. I just want to save time inputing tasks because 99% are recurring."
You forgot about those really nice middle class moms that give out homeade treats like cookies and ghost shaped rice crispy treats.
"This.

Movie tickets and a dinner cert. from Costco!"
"Just don't talk about The Stuff. It knows, and it doesn't like it."
Will do for sure
"Wondered why you had to explain that, then remembered where I am reading this..."
"I think you might have it confused with a different game. In FTL, you play as a Federation ship on a suicide mission trying to take down the rebel flagship to end a long war between the two. You also don’t get any more powerful when you restart, so it’s a purer roguelike in that sense. You can unlock more ships and stuff though if that’s what you meant."
"Fucking lies! It’s peanut butter cups in every state. Come on kids, am I right?!?!"
FUCK the slo mo
Why the hell did I come in this thread after skipping breakfast and 3 hours until lunch :(
"It certainly does. But the light quality is fine, and some things you don't need to BIFL."
"When I was growing up, there were 4 newspapers in our city & we received every one.  Today, I receive the WSJ six days a week, local paper seven days & almost daily read at least one (of the remaining 2) of my hometown papers online."
I guess he was unavailable at the time.
"Don't obsess that ""she never be your mother"". She's one of your parents and she probably makes your Dad happy. Giving her anything on Mother's Day would probably make her feel really good. I'm speaking as a step-child, my relationship with all my parents was so much better when I let go and let them be parents."
