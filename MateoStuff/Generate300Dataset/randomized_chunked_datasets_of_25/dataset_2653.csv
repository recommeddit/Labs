69608,best major to study in college,"My mom stresses crazy easy as well, she doesn't handle trauma well, but discovered she could handle elderly care and peaceful death, so she's actually ended up a nursing home RN for about 10 years then a hospice RN the past 15. Although in my mind, it'd be a lot easier to deal with trauma than to literally dedicate your career to taking care of people who are actively dying, but she claims it's easier"

7189,best iPhone,"Personally I found this at a 40 dollar cheaper price which every dollar counts in my budget right now, and because of the better battery life, the XR gets almost double the hours of screen on time the XS gets, not sure about the XS Max but that was about 150 dollars more than the XR I bought. Also I actually prefer LCD because OLEDs use pulse width modulation to control the brightness (basically rapidly flickering the display) and that makes me and some other people get headaches after using it for a half hour or so straight and can even cause dizziness or nausea. I just get a headache more with an OLED, the screen on this is perfectly fine as it has a pixel density of 326 and the LCD contributes to that longer battery life, and can still play 1080p video it just scales it to the display since it has a high enough pixel density. Still a gorgeous display. It’s also compared to the standard XS (not the max) is a larger display at 6.1” verses the smaller body and screen on the XS. It’s perfect, not too big not too small. I’d honestly recommend this over the XS because of the battery life, larger display and over all size over the XS, and it’s cheaper in most cases if you search for the right deal."
