12029,best gifts for dad,"When I told my girlfriend that I was going to start biking to work, she talked her dad into giving up his bike (which he can't ride anymore due to knee problems). It is a 30 year old 10-speed, and she worked with her roommate who works in a bike shop to get it restored. She gave it to me for my birthday and I was totally floored by the amount of effort and thought that went into it. Total home run."
27609,best bollywood actor,"God if someone says Ranbir (ratatouille) kapoor , I'm fighting"

A lot of my research is about mathematical oncology and I often [blog about it](https://egtheory.wordpress.com/tag/mathematical-oncology/), but always wanted there to be a good podcast on cancer research.

11879,best gifts for dad,You can find drones on Amazon with cameras for $50. A lot of which have free shipping. What dad doesn't want a spy drone.

That's why I decided to ask the Reddit community"

72351,best keyboard switches,"Oh yes, forgot about BOX Blacks! I like most BOX switches, so I‚Äôll give them a try. Thanks for the recommendation!"
32924,best energy drink,"I recommend Focus Aid or Red Bull. Bang's BCAAs aren't for cognition and CoQ10 is in too small amounts to do any good so really it's just Bang's caffeine there to help with focus. However it would be metabolically better to have a steady stream of caffeine from multiple Red Bulls as opposed to one large dose caffeine of Bang.
The other drink, Focus Aid, seems a bit harder to find but it contains caffeine *as well as* other ingredients to help you focus: Vitamin C helps make neurotransmitters, which send messages to nerve cells. A deficiency in Vitamin D increases risk of cognitive decline (meaning IDK if it'll help you in one night but maybe a long term thing).
#important : Choline is your BFF here.
Alpha GPC gets metabolized into the active form of choline...More good news for your neurotransmitters."

You might try seeing if you can browse to the site via [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) or get a paid torrent friendly VPN (see /r/VPNTorrents) in the case your country or ISP is blocking it.

Otherwise you'll have to try using a general public torrent indexer, or join private torrent trackers for audiobooks (see /r/Trackers). AFAIK there are no other public torrent sites specialized in audiobooks."
