32924,"I recommend Focus Aid or Red Bull. Bang's BCAAs aren't for cognition and CoQ10 is in too small amounts to do any good so really it's just Bang's caffeine there to help with focus. However it would be metabolically better to have a steady stream of caffeine from multiple Red Bulls as opposed to one large dose caffeine of Bang.
The other drink, Focus Aid, seems a bit harder to find but it contains caffeine *as well as* other ingredients to help you focus: Vitamin C helps make neurotransmitters, which send messages to nerve cells. A deficiency in Vitamin D increases risk of cognitive decline (meaning IDK if it'll help you in one night but maybe a long term thing).
