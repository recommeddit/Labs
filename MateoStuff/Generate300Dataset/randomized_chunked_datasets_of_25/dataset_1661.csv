67655,"Do you mean two separate sponsors asking for two conflicting requirements?  If so I'd imagine they'd either fork it and give both sponsors what they want, or possibly give the company with the request that's likely to be less popular a custom version while the main version goes with the other request.  Devs typically hate to do this  though (since you could start with two versions and eventually have 6, 12, 16, etc), so if there's any way to just pass in an optional switch and have that all be in one code base they'll certainly want to do that.

There's usually a way to make that work in a single code base.  Developers will typically go very far out of their way to make it work, and even if it's something much more fundamental, like which platform you're running your code on, there are still options involving build processes.  I'd like to be more specific, but this is where I typically bow out and have a back end developer explain it since it'd be them doing the work and I don't want to misrepresent what they do or have it appear that I'd be the one making it happen.",axios alternatives reddit

13952,"PhD student here: ACM, IEEE (lots of journals but can't access much without using a Russian website or paying), and Google Scholar are my go tos for general searching. If I want to dig deeper I have to start looking at conference proceedings. That's where the CORE conference portal helps. Just type in something like ""artificial intelligence"" and it will come up with conferences that have to do with AI. It also ranks them so you get an idea of how good they are.

1. You need an adult toothpaste if you are older than 6 years old and it NEEDS to contain fluoride.  Ideally greater than 1000 ppm. 
2. If you have a bunch of cavities or high risk of cavities (ie having dry mouth) then you must ask your doc for a prescription toothpaste of 5000 ppm. 
3. The most important step is to SPIT NOT RINSE YOURE TOOTHPASTE OUT. (Spit as much as you can out)
