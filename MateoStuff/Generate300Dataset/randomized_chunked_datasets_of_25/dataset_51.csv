11425,best gifts for dad,"I want my dad to focus on his damn health. I want the crazy go anywhere guy. Unless I smoked a ton and wanted to watch Law and Order repeatedly,we wouldn't hang out. It is horrible. I want my dad back. Not for me and my selfish ideations. For my mom. She's hurting without him. Sure he there physically but her husband isn't. Her lover is gone. I want them to be the couple that I was to model my marriage after. I want my dad to want another year of life. It's too much to ask but damnit, I want my father, my daddy back. F.M.L."

64587,Best Nike running shoes,"I have the Men's version of the LunarEpic Low's and the Pegs...I use the LunarEpics for my short distance runs / casual day to day \- and I use the Pegs for all my longer runs and all my races...love them both...i'd just make sure you're comfortable with how ""spongy"" the LE's feel over a longer period of time...they feel like clouds on your feet when you're just walking around and for shorter runs...but I can't speak for how they feel over longer distances \(over 10K//6.2M\)...also, my one gripe with them is that their sole collects little pebbles and debris like crazy...it's mildly annoying when you're running and you can hear/feel the scraping of them!

Was just at the Nike Outlet the other day and they had the LunarEpic's for 100 CAD. I think they had the Pegs 33's on for around the same, as well."
