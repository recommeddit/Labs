56386,"I mean, I had a TN panel as my primary for gaming before this, do all my singleplayer gaming on my OLED and have a lot of experience on IPS too.

The black level smearing exists, but only in scenes with extreme contrast and very fast motion. I primarily use the panel for competitive FPS and it's perfectly acceptable in terms of average g2g. Again, non-issue imo considering the monitor's specs. 

Would take this HDR1000 200hz 1440p ultrawide over any IPS panel on the market if we're disregarding price.

Having said that, I've used lower-end VAs at friends' houses before and some of them are literally unusable for fast paced games imo.",best desktop monitor

67501,"I use axios for everything, which is amazing if you work a lot with Apis

A good pattern to use is creating an axios instance with all your defaults set, and then indeed only exporting functions to re-use.

If you have a standardized return format, you can also use interceptors to pre-format standardized responses.

    // /utils/api.js
    import Axios from 'axios'
    
    const axios = Axios.create({
      baseURL: url,
      crossDomain: true,
      timeout: 200000,
      withCredentials: true,
      credentials: 'same-origin',
      responseType: 'json'
    })
    
    axios.interceptors.response.use(
      async (response) => {
        if (response.data.ERR) {
          return Promise.reject(response.data.ERR)
        }
        return response.data.RSP
      }, 
      async (error) => Promise.reject(error))
    )
    
    export const getAccount = 
      (origId, acctId) => axios.get(`/orgs/${orgId}/accts/${acctId})
        .then(json=> json.ACCT)
    // the interceptor pre-formats your response. saves you tons of boilerplate.

[An example](https://github.com/doxick/eve-maps/tree/master/client/app/utils/api) of how you can use this, including multiple axios instances for different baseUrls",axios alternatives reddit
