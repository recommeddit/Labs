It’s woodsy, floral, light, powdery, but not overwhelmingly so. It has non of the saccharine sweet “femininity” that many modern perfumes for women have buckets of.

55299,"If you want adventure, try Rafael Sabatini's books. If you read several of his books you night notice some plot elements get repeated, but they're still great fun. *Captain Blood*, *Scaramouche*, and *The Sea Hawk* are, I think, his best-known.

And of course I have to add my usual plug for the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. Some of the best historical fiction around.

Sword and sorcery adventure: Conan the Barbarian stories by Robert E. Howard. Very good light entertainment. Howard is no Tolkien, but he does evoke something of the same feeling of an entire world out there of which he's only telling parts. There are various pastiches of Conan, but they're generally not quite as good as the original stories. Amazon has a Kindle edition of Conan for $0.99.",best action and adventure novel series
