65178,best phone service company,ATT and Verizon is the best bang for your buck. I have both (one is work phone) and I rarely have no service. ATT is the worse of the two but the different is negligible for the common consumer. Both city and rural. Sprint is still shit but its going to be moot once they finished the merger with T-Mobile. T-Mobile right now is perfectly fine in urban and city areas BUT its completely unreliable in rural. There are exceptions but youre better off assuming it doesn't work. I know T-mobile has been aggressively expanding their coverage and added with the Sprint infrastructure that may change things. Recent years I've only heard of improvements in their reliability in the urban/suburban areas. I still hear complaints in rural areas.

61195,Best comedy show on Netflix,"IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKSWING???

(Not really clever or witty, that line, but still hilarious.)"
4170,best text editor,"For C programming there are two options:
1) Vim: editor not an IDE. It's my choice. Vim has a lot of plugin for autocomplete and for customization.
2) CLion: one of the best IDE that I ever used. It's very easy to use, it is configurated perfectly since the first start.
Seeking information about Vim you could discover Emacs, my advice is to avoid emacs because it's very complicated as editor."
13726,best research paper archive,"Two pages into the Cohen paper and I've already learned so much. Granted, my field doesn't deal with statistical analysis all that often, so I'm not an expert, but this is a fantastic paper."
60017,best perfume,"For someone who rarely pays more than Â£40 for perfume these days, I've barely explored cheapies. Getting a good deal on something pricey must be more satisfying ðŸ˜œ

Les Senteurs Gourmandes Vanille de la Reunion is my cheapest fave. It was Â£23/100ml.

ETA do celeb scents count? They're cheap by default but if so, Rihanna Reb'l Fleur and Rihanna Rogue."
61766,Best RPG game on PS4,"Id say Nier and HZD hit about every criteria of RPG i can possibly think of. 

Levels, Questing, Upgradeable gear, etc."

54587,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Zero is the safest one because it's the most premium version of all the pads people are used to. Otsu v2 is pretty unique, but I find it hard to believe anyone wouldn't like this surface. Otsu v2 is really insane! Honestly all artisan pads are and they all fit a niche well."
69283,best major to study in college,"Because of the other institutions we work with my speaking French is an advantage. We also happen to have projects in the country I focused on for French colonial influence and I was able to impress a visiting scholar from the country with my knowledge of his country's past and present situation. The guy was really cool, I like working with him, and it was a good cause. This led me to volunteer there for 9 months. The combination of this, my being an English speaker, and relative fluency in Mandarin led to my being offered the position.

Honestly, I'm faking it til I make it at this point."
34009,best Pokemon game,"If you don't mind running tru Johto again then go Hearth Gold or Soul Silver, very excellent games.

If you want to experience something new, I'll put black 2 /white 2 at first, then at the second place Platinum or Emerald.

Good luck!

Gen6 X or Y are good entries just because of the new improvements of 3d models and such but story wise it is very poor, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are great entries that would be my third recommend."
64047,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"Quick question, as it does say its free. But when downloading it prompts for a 4.99 payment on each|? Any ideas/guidance would be hugely appreciated"
43565,best items under $100,Yes! I surround my desk with them so I've got something to look at while I'm waiting for stuff at work. It's very satisfying to watch them grow over time and I also think that being near plants is something that's psychologically good for humans on a very primeval level.

15118,best tree for the garden,"Oh, wow... that's the advice I needed.  

The sites I looked at that sell the seedlings gave the impression I'd have a thick privacy wall by the end of this summer."
30175,best Mexican war to study,"The Mexican-American War receives very little attention in American history classes at the primary or university level, and it is not a big part of ""public memory"" in the sense that there aren't many books written about it, monuments made to it, etc. 

These days I think it would normally be taught as a war of conquest. At the time it was extremely controversial and many Northerners in America thought that it was a fake pretext for the South to grab more slave territories. Abe Lincoln's most notable act when he was in Congress was to sponsor an act called the ""Spot Resolution,"" where he demanded an investigation to determine the exact spot where Mexican troops had allegedly fired on American troops. Northerners suspected that the alleged event that triggered the war had been made up by the Polk Administration as a pretext for a land-grab."
