"You're only being 'punished' if you have the mindset that college degrees exist solely for the purpose of getting you a job. If that's your stance, then yeah, it was probably a mistake to get a degree in fine arts.

If you just wanted to *learn things*, then nobody is punishing you."

"Fun fact: I have one of these in my lab:

[https://www.totalphase.com/products/advanced-cable-tester-v2/](https://www.totalphase.com/products/advanced-cable-tester-v2/)

Among the many things it does, it tests the DC Resistance of various wires and pins. It will effectively measure voltage drop at maximum rated current (3A or 5A). It will actually even do a per-pin measurement of all of the Vbus pins and all of the Gnd pins individually to suss out bad contact resistance at the connector too.

For a 5A cable, the Vbus path must not have more than 100 mΩ of impedance. The Gnd path must not have more than 50 mΩ."
