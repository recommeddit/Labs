You linked to a webcam with a slow fixed focus 12mm equivalent lens and a sensor that I'm guessing is somewhere around 1/2.3"" Type if we're lucky (probably even smaller).

That is an example of a bad webcam, and the fact that you are seeing it as being an upgrade over most webcams further demonstrates just how bad webcams currently are. It may be sufficient for people's use cases, but that doesn't make it a good camera using modern technology.

The difference between that webcam (or the worse webcams you're upgrading people to that one from) and something like an Elgato Facecam (or one of the cheaper competitors without Elgato pricing) is night and day, and that's still not even a good camera. It's just better than most of the rest of the webcam market.",best webcamera
