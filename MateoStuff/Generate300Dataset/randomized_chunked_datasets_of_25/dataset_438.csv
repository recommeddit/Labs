33717,best electric car,"Off-road electrics are great, as you can make them completely water proof and they have instant torque, think about it, but I don’t like the idea of an American sports car having one just for nostalgia, but other countries cars can be electric, and our non sports cars and I will be fine"

39828,best Chrome extensions,"They started sticking them *in* the videos nlw too.

I dont mind the 5 sec clip at the start but Wish is a garbage store and forcing me to have to watch their shit ads multiple time isnt gonna make me change my mind. In fact, cutting so adburptly to it only reinforces my negative sentiment towards the brand."

>I've used this, for a client, and it looks fine. They suck because people dont know what 1080p means, or why they want it, and buy 720p or lower.

You linked to a webcam with a slow fixed focus 12mm equivalent lens and a sensor that I'm guessing is somewhere around 1/2.3"" Type if we're lucky (probably even smaller).

That is an example of a bad webcam, and the fact that you are seeing it as being an upgrade over most webcams further demonstrates just how bad webcams currently are. It may be sufficient for people's use cases, but that doesn't make it a good camera using modern technology.

The difference between that webcam (or the worse webcams you're upgrading people to that one from) and something like an Elgato Facecam (or one of the cheaper competitors without Elgato pricing) is night and day, and that's still not even a good camera. It's just better than most of the rest of the webcam market."

5446,best home improvement store,"Of course there's a difference. They're entirely different stores. And HD caters more towards contractors, while Lowe's caters towards homeowners. (Lowe's is dropping that and going after the contractor market in the future though)"
