39000,best web browser,There is an extension/add-on called [Page Load Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/p8yoet/page_load_time_is_the_photo_finish_of_browser/) for people who disagree with this.
52722,best hiphop album,"Honestly, if you're not a DOOM fan, you're not an actual person."
50527,best rap album,"Clipse - Hell Hath No Fury

It's an entirely Neptunes-produced album, which makes it enormously cohesive, and it has this dark, gritty, minimalistic vibe with synths that seem from outer space and bass that will straight rattle your shit. Even though this feels like one single whole with the same building blocks, every song is different and unique. F.e. Ride Around Shining's twisted glistening sound vs. Wamp Wamp's thumping warped bongos . No other album illustrates as clearly what the Neptunes were capable of in their prime, and it was fucking magnificent.

Runner-ups: GZA - Liquid Swords; Jay Z - The Blueprint; Dr. Dre - Chronic 2001"
7411,best laptop for general use,"Thanks for making this post, as it's been a good minute since  I've done laptop shopping and am still ignorant about what's what.

Looking buy a $1200 or less laptop (to replace my Asus Q524U) that can run simulation and CAD programs simalteneously and seamlessly, as well as (if possible) run newer games like the upcoming Battlefield.

Prefer no touchscreen, as I have heard that it contributes to poor battery life and gradually takes a toll on laptop performance. Lmk if this is completely wrong."

11584,best gifts for dad,I have one. Scared the shit out of me the first time i woke up to them.
30333,best Mexican war to study,"I joined Reddit just to add this, though no one will see it.  The Taiping Rebellion in China has got to be one of the craziest things you will ever read about (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion).  Basically, this guy (Hong Xiuquan) was on his way to take a civil service exam.  Some missionary was preaching and handed him a translated version of the Bible.  He had some dream where he was standing next to Jesus and God or something.  Then SEVEN YEARS LATER he digs these pamphlets out of his closet and interprets the dream to mean that he is Jesus' younger brother.  From there he basically started some type of cult and took over half of China.  I don't know much besides the basic outline, but something like 20 MILLION people were killed as a result.  It has to be one of the most bizarre stories that no one has ever heard of."

52604,best hiphop album,"You rappers doodoo, baby shit, just basic booboo."
56033,best action and adventure movie,I thought Aquaman was a great adventure movie. Sure you have to be able to get past the script but if you can get lost in the spectacle and adventure it’s good goofy fun.
28807,best breakfast foods,">stir in the frozen blueberries (keeping them frozen and stirring them in last helps prevent the entire mix from turning purple).

Where's the fun in that?!

Thank you for this: I'm actually feeling a bit motivated to do the shop & meal prep this week!"
54792,best water filter,I use zero water; it's slightly more expensive than a Brita but it filters chromium 6 and lead (most filters do not). For me the extra few dollars up front was worth it.
73610,best battery bank,"If you've been using the old USB-A type chargers, those deliver 10W tops and generally 5W or 2.5W if they're cheap. 

A standard laptop does NOT use 60W constantly so you do not need that much wattage. 60W means you'd burn through your onboard battery in a little over an hour, whereas running at a standard level of usage (7-8 hours of battery life) puts you at around 10-15W. 

I also looked up the Surface Book battery consumption and some models pull more than 100W under heavy load and drain even while plugged into the wall. If you really need to keep a battery running during high load applications, you can probably afford to spend a bit more.  

You also get what you pay for. The manufacturer claims that it ships with a 65W cable (why though, if it can do 100W?) and so the buyer needed to get a 100W cable to use it. No response from the buyer and nobody else has done testing, so assume it's 60W like all of the others."
45692,best trick or treating candy,Agreed! Im glad someone else out there has some fucking sense
18108,best Kardashian,What the hell that's just rude I'd ask for her autograph and tear it up in front of with a comeback like sorry i dont want autographs from entitled children lmao how absolutely awful!
60454,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I've only seen bits and pieces of it. I dont usually watch drama type shows, but I enjoyed the little bit I did watch!

The mom/wife is so hilarious, sometimes i think shes overacting, but it works so well for the character."
68165,best science fiction novel,"I absolutely love the genre of, ""a community reacts to disaster"" and all the reactions in One Second After strike me as authentic. All the characters do what they want to do, rather than just because the author is trying to set up a scene.

The writing and editing are perfectly acceptable IMHO. Forstchen has been writing perfectly acceptable pulp genre novels for decades. If you are a fan of literary fiction that would explain our different responses (I don't care for that flowery garbage ;-)  If you are left wing politically (I vote for whoever is going to rack up the least debts) you might be offended enough by the politics to have developed a grudge against the writing and editing.

For me it stands side by side with Lucifer's Hammer at the top of its genre."

28849,best breakfast foods,"Egg ""muffins"" (mini frittatas) are handy,  you can make them and freeze for a quick reheat and go.  Making different flavor combinations means you get variety.     
Overnight refrigerator oats with chia and fruit. Yogurt.   
SMOOTHIES! Peel and freeze a bag of bananas, buy a big bag of prewashed mixed greens and freeze as-is (you just grab a handful,  they stay loose frozen), frozen fruit like berries.  Blend water or milk,  a frozen banana, handful greens, half cup other frozen fruit, a couple tbsp nut butter, or raw cashews or chia or hemp seeds, a few ice cubes.  Always good and filling.    
Egg sandwiches.
     
Big fan of leftovers for breakfast, you can put an over-medium egg on anything."
56653,best desktop monitor,"I'm new to this stuff, so I just have a couple of questions:

-I see that a 1080Ti is recommended for 1440p/144hz gaming, but wouldn't that be for AAA gaming? I've read that 1070Ti can work as well.

-Isn't there a lot of debate around what size of monitor is the best? What do you guys recommend?"
41916,movies like Inception,"Honestly, it's one of the most quotable movies I know.

If it hadn't been for that opening scene in Times Square I may have turned it off in the middle because there was a period was it was pretty chick-flicky and then it totally redeemed itself in ways I never imagined. That scene with ""tech support"" somehow made the beach boys feel chaos inducing! Incredible soundtrack."
56760,best desktop monitor,"I have two of [these](https://www.amazon.com/AOC-I2267FW-22-Inch-Frameless-Brightness/dp/B00CLZ047Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468252934&sr=8-1&keywords=aoc+i2267fw) and they look amazing for the price! It has an IPS panel so the colors are very vibrant. 

FYI: Only DVI and VGA but a both of mine use HDMI to DVI cables"
47319,best state to visit in the United States,"As you mentioned, Minneapolis or Chicago would be good big cities to visit, especially if you want to see an NFL or hockey game. If you are in the Upper Midwest, be sure to at least spend some time driving along the shore of a lake and visiting the small towns along the shore."
