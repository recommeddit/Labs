23267,best car racing video game,"Sim games are typically as faithful to real life as possible. They have a high skill ceiling and are much more difficult to be fast and toy suffer the consequences of physics. Sometimes you can tune or customize cars but not to the extent you think.

Arcade racers are usually focused on racing in their own sense and don't try to replicate real life past you being in a car. Forza mixes the two pretty well and customization is great. 

Honestly, if you're just getting into racing forza is a good choice."

31671,best hotel to live in,You really have to like being by yourself.  I eat dinner every night at a restaurant alone but sometimes sit at the bar and talk to the staff.  You basically are alone and develop casual relationships with people.  I love to read so I don't really mind but occasionally get the blues.  I miss home quite a bit since that's where friends and family reside.  I try to fly back one weekend a month.  As far as scary or freaky....no.

56430,best desktop monitor,"> What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve.

Every panel is different. Your panel is not indicative of another panel even in the same product line. You absolutely can not make this claim accurately. Panels from the exact same line bought from the same batch can have completely different gamma curves, out of the box contrast ratios and even different color temperatures at the same values. 

This is why calibration is so *individual* and why you should not randomly apply settings that someone else tells you are *good* because whats good for one panel might be complete garbage for another.

> What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve.

Out of the box Gamma1 I had a gamma curve of around 2.3 (Samsung claimed calibration at 2.26)

After my final calibration I have a gamma curve of around 2.22 (Gamma2) with a contrast ratio of 2370:1 with my black equalizer to 12, contrast 75, brightness 25. 

Compared to OLED its pure garbage, compared to IPS it offers ""deep blacks"" and a ""contrasty"" look and it aint due to a 2.4 gamma curve because I dont have  2.4 gamma curve.

*edit*

Im using an x-rite ColorMunki. In all fairness..I only bought it for calibrating my CRT originally and im sure its not the best on the market for calibrations. So...maybe take that into account I guess."

29222,best web hosting service,"It depends on countries you live in. I only have experience with Cloudey, their support is fast and helpful, but their server is not litespeed server though, so if you loved litespeed you might be disappointed. If litespeed is not your concern then I absolutely recommend Cloudey."

26888,best board games,"I've played  **Brass**, **Food Chain Magnate**, **A Feast for Odin**, and  **Twiliight Struggle**  10 to 50 times  and they're seriously good games.  Biggest ping against most of them is the opening becomes a bit samey and you can tell the creator meant for some things to be viable that just aren't, but if you get over it they offer a great experience at least through the number of plays I've done."

39281,best web browser,"My firefox is using 241MB of ram with 4 reddit tabs open and my whole system is using 1.3GB. What website are you on or how many tabs are you running? Often there are scripts on pages that will blow out the ram usage, which is not browser based. Except google sites which intentionally cause issues on none Chrome browsers, very much a Microsoft move."
13386,best spreadsheet editor,"One can clearly make a more versatile and efficient spreadsheet language. 

Since Excel and most of the other knock-offs came out there have been major improvements in computational science. Nowadays we have languages like Julia which use JIT compilation (it's like python (or VBA if you are more familiar with that) except it produces fast machine code after the initial compilation). Something like a Rust/C core program and using Julia for the actual embedded language would be a vast speed improvement.

Now if you were using the spreadsheet for mathematics that's where the real improvement would be. You could ""easily"" (as in technically feasible) build a full computer algebra system in the spreadsheet. Which is why I referenced using Matlab for spreadsheets since it's actually conceptually close (and a language i assumed would be well-known here) and would basically just need an gui interface for a spreadsheet. 

The reason why nobody does it is because Excel works just well enough for business (even a lot of businesses resort to specialized software after a certain scale). That's it. I don't get how that's a unpopular opinion here."
