"The response time is not for gamers if you look at real gtg on the dell, it's more suited for office and content."

"I wish I could double upvote you for `got`. Server code absolutely does not need all the features an isomorphic library like `axios` provides, let alone all the rest of bloat it includes for both client and server."

Actually started reading this but heard there is only one monster? I do like the writing so far.
"Maybe Kevin's intention wasn't to split the pie, but OP thanked him as the pie was arriving, putting Kevin in an awkward position where he had to split it."
"Rodgers, Brady, Mahomes, Kelce, Adams, Donald and Henry should be guaranteed top 10.

I would consider TJ, Diggs/Hill/Ramsey and Allen to round the top 10"

"Alright. I saw on buildapcsales about a month and a half ago you could get it for $375, should I wait until that deal comes back maybe? Or until like Black Friday? Iâ€™m not sure."
"Probably the Virgin River Hotel and Casino in Mesquite Nevada.   It got fairly bad reviews from what I see online (had to look up to find the name of the town/hotel, luckily Mesquite is a pretty tiny town so it was easy.), at 3 stars, but it's the best I've personally stayed in.    According to the blurb:  ""Budget hotel with pet-friendly rooms plus 2 outdoor pools, arcade, free breakfast & a 24-hour bar.""


There are probably a lot nicer ones, but it doesn't really matter to me what inn/hotel I stay at as long as the heating/cooling works, the beds are clean and comfortable.   At the end of the day, all hotels are for me is simply a place to sleep."
"Seconded, they are just really great powerbanks. Had mine for close to 3 years and it still holds an excellent charge and works perfect even after being treated rather rough"
"Brad Pitt, without a doubt.  I have a job where I run across famous people with some regularity, and he was one of the few that was really and truly warm and genuine."

"If you like the deep cuts, I'd reiterate Contact, like others have said. I'd also add Gattaca (1997)"
Is Disco Elysiam that good? Iâ€™m generally curious.
It's such a wide array of fragrances that it was honestly like 90% a shot in the dark haha.
"The article doesn't include a few important points. 

First, it's more than just money. Doctors make a lot of money, but they also go to school for the better part of a decade, come out of school up to their eyeballs in debt, and spend years before they even think about working a 40 hour 9 to 5 job. They make a lot, but they spend a lot of time away from their family working a high stress, high demand job. This is just an example, I'm sure we could name ten other fields where the same type of thing occurs. A smart man once said to me, ""college is an investment in yourself. You're investing so you can work with your brain not your back, and have better hours and work conditions (hopefully). Doctors work hard but the payoff is a good career that gets better with time. They're hard workers, they just want to work hard in an office instead of a ditch. 

The list makes sense in the respect that it illustrates the careers you're most likely to find good paying and stable work in. They're not playing favorites, it's just an observation. 

Secondly, college is an investment. The money you put in should be invested with the hope that you'll pay off the initial investment and make some in the long run. your also investing in a better job, not just for pay but work conditions, retirement, benefits, hours, etc. If you have a few hundred thousand to throw at a degree that will land you a job doing something you could do without it, hey, it's your money. 

I worked on the railroad for a decade without anything more than a high school education. I made a good amount of money, but the trade off was working a hard job with shit-ass hours and no room to move up. At 28 I was at the ""top of my field"" and it didn't look good. 

Finally, there's life outside of college. I like the railroad and it's wasn't a bad job. I left because I wanted something that paid the bills but still allowed me to spend time with my family. I need money to live, but family is more important and college allowed me the chance to find a good career that didn't take me away so much. I went to college to invest in myself. I don't regret it, but the flood of college goers has me saying ""fuck it"". I'm teaching my daughters to weld and drive construction equipment."
"Hah, thatâ€™s a good idea! I could also add the wood if I know. Thanks for the tip."
"No place has guaranteed health care. It's either rationed or paid. Forget getting paid well for your social science interest unless you are the best in your field, countries with public education tends to have a lot of people with degrees competing against you for those jobs."
I like to blend essential oils. I get way more compliments on those scents than when I wear perfume.
