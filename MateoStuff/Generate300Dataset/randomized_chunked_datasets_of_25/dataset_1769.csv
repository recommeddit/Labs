45399,"Ps5, series x, switch, pc. 

Ps5 in bedroom for action adventure games. Nier, immortals, etc. Also fighting games and exclusives. 

Series x for back compat and exclusives. 

Switch for exclusives. Haven't touched since Zelda. It's actually packed up in my garage. 

Pc for most games for multiple reasons. 

-Cheaper games

-No online fee
(Anthem unusable on series x without gold. Plays just fine on pc) 

-Any game with precision aiming feels much better on pc. Shooters. 

-Emulation. Currently have a Wii set up on my PC. Playing punch out and Silent hill on the Wii in HD. 

-Mods. 
Even slight tweaks make all the difference. Like more gore, faster walking speed, etc. 

-Multitasking

-Older games

-rts/strategy games.",best gaming system

11. No love story- I liked the platonic relationship between the characters and that they didn't need to push anything onto Katy and Shang-Chi, there was enough emotional moments that a relationship would be forced 
12. Karaoke- I mean, who doesn't love karaoke

72099,"You make your point well and I could see having a decent debate on the subject, but I disagree completely. In fact, the twist in The Village not only completely destroys the tension built through the entire film, but also diminishes any sense of connection and relatability we may have felt for the protagonists. Ask yourself, what is to be gained from knowledge that it does not actually take place in the past? Could this village not have been a congregation of pioneers tired of the greed and death that filled much of the early american history? That they made a settlement away from everything else in order to escape the evil and pain of the world? Does the fact that they started this village in say, the 1970's as opposed to the 1870's make any change to the story we've been told so far, or even have any impact on the themes presented? This is the very first(and possibly only) case of Shymalan having a needless twist. In fact, I think the village would've been a much better film had they simply 1. Not had the twist. and 2. Saved the reveal of Bryce Dallas Howard learning the monsters aren't real until  AFTER the chase with Adrien Brody. Those two things alone would've made that film on par with his first three. But his ego got too big, and his lack of understanding of his own works shown through.",best movies with a cool twist

I might start doing the firearm thing.

Not too long ago I had nothing to do so I got to the airport way early. Once inside security I noticed I had plenty of time to make an earlier flight. So I went to the customer unsupport desk and the lady told me since I already checked my bag there was nothing they could do. As I'm sitting on the plane waiting to take off I get a text that my bag had arrived.....on the fucking flight I wanted to be on.

41002,"Difficulty is a multidimensional thing.

You can get a nice tone from a piano rather easily, but to find the correct notes, or even fitting ones with all 10 fingers at once (or in rapid succession) is a whole other story.

Then on the other end of that spectrum there´s the violin, on which you have to master some rather complicated techniques just to get one decent tone, but on the other hand aren´t expected to do the harmonic maths required for the piano - at least not to that extent.

Then there are instruments that are easier to play but also rather limited in their tonal possibilities, like pentatonic dulcimers or the irish tin whistle. The latter has a catch though: It is made for playing in the keys irish music traditionally uses, and makes playing fast in these keys relatively easy. On the other hand that speed, and the rapid embellishments are expected in irish music.",best instrument to play

65669,"I've done and worked for all 4 carriers. 

Here's my honest, no bullshit ranking, based off my experience in the west coast, and Utah/Colorado 

Verizon: Best for coverage. Data speeds abysmal in congested areas(which is everywhere with a population over 5k). Worse if you have a deprioritized plan. Customer service lacks with hold times and stores have this strange civil war between corporate and indirects. 


AT&T: Second best for coverage, second best for speeds. Tmobile is faster. Customer service lacks, not in hold times, but in the amount of overseas reps for literally anything. Pretty balanced company. Shit billing system and they need to lose TV though. 


T-Mobile: Best for customer service, best for speed. Does not work in buildings still as of 11/2018. Coverage 3rd place for that reason alone. Still lacking rural coverage. 


Sprint:
