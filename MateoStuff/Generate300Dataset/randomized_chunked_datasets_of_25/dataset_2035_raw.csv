"HB regular pencils, different pencils wont make you a better artist"
Don't. Kids are germ-ridden animals.
"I thought of that before but since the screen will be like \~10cm away from the wall, desk/wall mount just feels awkward no matter how I slice it. And I'm not really in a spot that allows me to change my desk unless I change a few other furnitures as well"
"I walk around town with the pound strapped down to my side   
No frontin just in case I gotta smoke somethin 



Good ass album"
"It's great if you're out and about. Hell, I've even used mine at home because my phone was low and there wasn't a wall plug close enough to charge my phone from where I was sitting. I swear I'm not being paid to say this lmao."
I've always wanted to do something more on the operational side than just back office stuff. What kind of job do you do?
Straight vodka and sorrow.  Wake up next day and repeat.
"Oooh, I found another Russian troll trying to influence Americans. /s"
"This is a really good point, but I think this falls under the Peter Parker aspect of the movie, which is why I think Tobey is the best Peter. That being said, “FLYYY” ... “UP UP AND AWAY WEB!”"
"Here is [the recommendation chart](https://i.imgur.com/q9Xjv4p.jpg) that is usually linked by bot-chan. I think it is a good way to find shows to watch for a beginner, though you should also have a look at [MyAnimeList's Top Anime](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php)."
"I only wear sunglasses under $20! I lose them so much, it really adds up even at under $20 a pair. I don't understand why people buy expensive glasses other than prescription ones. There are soo many cute sunglasses that are cheap."
"This is probably the best sub-$100 purchase I've ever made. It's substantially better than toilet paper, and still a lot better than wet wipes (which I see suggested very often in various threads).

I use so little toilet paper now. I buy a 12-pack...once a year? For two people.

**EDIT:** I'm getting a lot of questions about installing a bidet. If you're interested to know what needs to be done to install one, [take a look at this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhExm0UFxAw)"
"Lowe's, I worked for Home Depot for a summer before quitting and taking a better job elsewhere and it was probably one of my top 3 worst places to have ever been employed, literally was written up for failing to have a positive enough attitude because and I'm quoting verbatim here "" I didn't smile enough "" I started job hunting immediately after that first one and it was such a pleasure to give them one shifts notice ( that's their own policy you only have to give a minimum of one shifts notice) that I was quitting."
"[Shakshuka](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/04/shakshuka/) rocks. It's eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce.

Gruel is yummy. You add several handfuls of oatmeal to last night's stew, and end up with thick, hearty, deliciousness.

On the lighter side, miso made with broth and thickened with egg is quite nice."
"The New Balance 320 from 1976 weighed about 9.6oz.  40 years later similar cushioned running shoes still weigh 8oz.  They also have more comfortable midsoles.  For arguments purposes, that may be less than 4 seconds per mile for a typical 9 minute miler. Let's say 1 second per decade or 0.1 second improvement per year.  

There is no real cutting edge in running shoes.  99% of your performance comes from your legs.  All of the running companies make entirely competent shoes. None make shoes that are significantly better than the rest.  Most make their shoes for less than $5 in a third world country. They all have marketing departments.  

We all buy into something.  
- Some of us would never wear brand X
- Some of us only brand Y
- Some of us enjoy being early adopters of each new tech
- Some of us like to be part of each new sub-trend (minimal, maximal, zero drop) 
- Some will wear the same model shoe for 10 years (even if it's changed beyond recognition in that 10 years and so have they)
- Some of us enjoy spending too much on our passion
- Some of us enjoy spending as little as possible on a great hobby that the only gear you really need are the shoes.
- Some of us enjoy reading this Reddit and devour each new ""which shoe is best"" thread.

I'm sure that there are multiple marketing departments that have lots of flip charts with all of these categories and more on them.  They probably know shoe X is more likely to appeal to type F and will probably sell better in NY than Oregon and will ensure that their stores are appropriately stocked the week after runner X wears them in race Y.

Don't even get me started on 100% polyester $50 running shirts  ;-)"
"I can agree with the jacket, I have had a Canada Goose for over 10 years, upper body never colds in a solid winter jacket. One aspect ill never cheap out again is a winter coat can be well worth $1,000 with the right insulation."
"Out of Penn entirely.  I figured if I wasn't going to stay at Wharton, it wasn't really worth the expense.  I could major in history somewhere else at one third the price,  so I finished at Penn State."
I read Lancome and was like.... uh... LOL
Vampyr is a good game. Have u tried?
"Nice, I’ll have to try it!"
"everybodys situation is different, work with what you got in your bank and how serious you want to be.

if you make six figures, heck, go get top end stuff, you obviously can afford it.

if you make minimum wage, craigslist what you need."

"This is brilliant. I'd love for this is to turn into an interactive chatbot that can help users filter down to find the best plans that fit their needs.

I've looked at ChatFuel, HelpScout, [ChatBot.com](https://ChatBot.com), Flox XO, Mobile Monkey, Flow.ia, and Intercom. Last time I looked into this my top pick was ChatFuel for around $15/mo.

My delays are figuring out the best chat software/tool, cost, and the logic flow for setting it all up. I feel like expanding to Canada, Mexico, and European plans, along with continuing to produce YouTube videos are my current priorities. 

Definitely open to ideas on this though. Maybe I'm overthinking it or overcomplicating it?"
You can actually even automate your tasks by recording them as macros and editing the VBA code. I found it super useful when I didn't know VBA.
"I’m going to try symmetry with built in popsocket for a pro max. Popsocket is super useful for a large phone. I am worried the case is gonna be huge though. 

I generally used official leather cases in the past. But I think they are overpriced for what they provide - fairly bulky, poor protection on the bottom, and slippery.

Clear case has no appeal at all to me. Clear cases look terrible whenever I see them and look worse over time with dirt and marks. Dark case or leather is the best.

I went caseless on my XS for a long time until accidentally dropping and shattering the screen. I had apple care but it’s still a hassle and the replacement screen had some dust under the camera lens. These phones break so easily, I just don’t think it’s worth going caseless as much as I love the naked phone."
