69575,best major to study in college,"Stand-alone language majors.

How are you, student learning a language in <4 years, going to compete with a bilingual speaker who also has skills for the workforce?

You **must** pair it with something else. If you want to major in a language, you double major."

52385,best hiphop album,"Yeah I figured that out later in the thread, I completely misread the post lmao. Thought you were saying it was your top 10 on RYM"
33045,best energy drink,Have you ever considered using a powdered energy drink that you can pick how much you make each serving? 2 scoops when you need extra caffeine or 1 scoop when you just want something nice?
39794,best Chrome extensions,"> Butt to Butt Plus: Changes all mentions of ""my Butt"" to ""my Butt""

29939,best money managing app,"I tried Mint, kept having to close and reopen the app anytime I wanted to add something manually so I gave up, I just use the google spreadsheet in the wiki, it tracks my savings accounts too which is great 

A lot of people like YNAB, but I’m not necessarily looking for a strict budget type tool that I need to pay for, ultimately I think it comes down to personal preference and what your goals are for the app since each probably has their own pros and cons"

38133,best Marvel movie,"Well, if you're watching for the commentaries, they're all great. Movies themselves, I don't know. I think they're all pretty watchable, but I don't know if that's enough for you. 

You probably will forget ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Captain Marvel"" and the first two ""Thor"" movies immediately after finishing them, but they're still fun as you're watching them. 

""Avengers"" is kind of a perfect action movie. 

The ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films are the ones with the most distinct style. 

People will swear that ""Black Panther"" and ""Iron Man 3"" are the ones that are truly great, and you might agree, but to me they're good in the exact same way the other ones are."

62041,Best RPG game on PS4,"I tried that and enjoyed it but didn't really see that there was much to the game: find monster, kill it, get some xp and gear, go back to town, restock and then go back out and kill another monster.

I've played it for about 5hrs so I wonder if the game opens up any more later on. What is it that brings you back to it?"
