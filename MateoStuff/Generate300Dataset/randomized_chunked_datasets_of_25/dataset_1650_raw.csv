"[torrentmac.net](https://torrentmac.net) is another good site. [mactorrents.io](https://mactorrents.io) has been offline for over a week now, which is my usual go-to. [minorpatch.com](https://minorpatch.com) is good, too and tends to have things before [macdrop.net](https://macdrop.net)."
"Not exactly high fashion, but these are really comfortable for my wide temples. [Maui Jim Twin Falls](

I can run in them, sleep in them, and have taken them on many cross country and international trips.

I have two and got the second one last year only because the plastic was getting too loose after 5 years."

Another monitor.  Your productivity will increase dramatically.
"Well fuck! With all the organization I've put into it, it's way better than gmail for me now..... Guess I'll need to find another solution."
"In no particular order, I'd say Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Walter Payton, Jerry Rice, Joe Montana, Deion Sanders, Lawrence Taylor, Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, Joe Namath."
Professional quality? Almost all high-level headphones are open past $300. Really I can only think of the Fostex TH-X00 as closed above that.
"Mean while van Gaal says: 'The Netherlands is no longer a top nation, so we shouldn't expect those results anymore'. Fuck off really, we should qualify easily for every big tournament at bare minimum."
Moon.
you just convinced me -- about to watch it :)
"Since it’s based on google search volume it’s probably not actually the most popular Halloween candy, he’s just inflating the search numbers."
"SUCH a awful follow up!!! I mean, why bother ffs?"
"> Andreas Christensen is the second highest valued Dane for €30m. But that doesn't even make him a top 50 most expensive CB on Transfermarkt.

I couldnt believe thats true so i checked and it actually isnt; actually Christensen is tied to the 31th most valuable CB together with Akanji, Mancini, Gomez, Mings, Stones and Ginter."
"Tom Segura’s Disgraceful is my all time favorite. Any of John Mullaneys (but the kid rock one was my least fave), all Bill Burr, Anthony Jeselnik (idk how to spell) Thoughts & Prayers, and the first Joe Rogan one"
"Not only that, there are multiple in-game achievements that can be earned based on both of them.  (The Onyxia encounter includes ""Many Whelps!  Handle it!"" and ""More Dots!"")  Players can also earn a title of ""Jenkins""  by triggering dragon whelps (can't remember the exact parameters) in Upper Blackrock Spire."
That isn’t the retail price.  That’s an amazon third party seller price

"The best is both the iPhone 4 and iPhone X, as I do think both set a lot of standards for what we think of as a “smartphone”, both in terms of design and performance. 

Both are packed to the brim with features that while not exactly new, were the catalyst for becoming main stays, as well as new technological innovations that remain unmatched for years. Both also set the standard for the next decade of design (the 5 and 6-8 all build upon the original design of the 4, just how the 11 and 12 (and future iPhones) are evolutions of the X).

The worst is the XS because, I mean, it’s the XS."
Agreed! I have been loving my $30 6GB Teltik plan!
"One thing I'm definitely tired of is how West Coast hikers brag that they don't need trails, and they just walk in the direction they want to go.  Yeah, go ahead and try to do that on the East Coast.  Someone will find you body in 2-5 years.  Not all areas, but in some areas definitely be careful.  Also the humidity is more of a challenge."
"18 league titles and 5 European cups (Liverpool), 25 league titles and 5 European cups (Barca). They have us beat by 7 league titles, which is a lot."
