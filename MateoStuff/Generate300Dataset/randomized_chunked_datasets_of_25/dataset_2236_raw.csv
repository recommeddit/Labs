"Thank you. If you want something durable and reliable, I'd say go for this [**Lenovo ThinkPad E15**](https://lenovo.vzew.net/3Vk2k) on sale.  [Take a look at my playlist with Ryzen 5 4500U benchmarks in games.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl2jvuy623sgmopA8S34wAz5D0XvCCCo8) It can definitely run the games you plan on playing. 

It is not on my list since it typically has poor availability."
"I too was spoiled by living in SD for a few years before coming here. You will never find any equivalent to the quality/variety of Asian cuisine here but I've found Mexican food that makes me happy.

Mexican: Hands down, El Sitio in Goleta off of Calle Real. Many people will say Lilly's which is pretty good but nothing has satisfied me more than El Sitio. If you want good sit-down Mexican food go for Los Agaves. It's excellent quality.

Thai: I've tried a couple Thai places and they have all been kinda just meh... They satisfy the craving but they're nothing like SD places. If you find a good one just let me know, I've been going to Pattaya Thai on Hollister.

Indian: I've tried 4 Indian places here and the best one by far is Tamira on Figeuroa and State street. Best tasting, priced just right, and excellent lunch buffet. The owner is super nice and actually remembers me every time.

Chinese: I've failed to find anything other than greasy American style Chinese food. It's great when I'm drunk/hungover/high but otherwise it's just average so I can't recommend anything.

Pho: I've only tried two places: Noodle City and Saigon Noodle House. Noodle city wins easily. The broth at Saigon was way too salty and the ingredients were scarce. I'll admit I only have limited Pho exposure while in SD but Noodle City is closer to what I like and remember.

Indonesian: Sama Sama is the place to go. Just do it. It's tapas/family style and pretty good.


Honestly, I was initially very disappointed with the lack of cheap, delicious food here in SB (I can't get carne asada fries at 3am? What the hell is that‽). Over the past 3 years though I've found a collection of restaurants that I love to dine at. Admittedly, most of the excellent places are more on the pricey side, but I can still afford to eat there once or twice a month. I can suggest a few places to check out that don't fall into the categories you were requesting:

Olio e Limon and Ca' Dario are excellent romantic (kinda spendy) Italian places. Of all the place I've tried, these were by far my favorite. 

Olio Pizzeria is amazing higher end pizza. They have a good selection of imported beer and make fine cocktails as well. The pizza is delicious and priced nicely.

Milk n' Honey is great tapas. They also have a large drink menu and everything I've tried from it has been exceptional. This is probably my most visited restaurant on the slightly more expensive side of things (it can be cheap, my bill is usually 50% alcohol).

The Lark is, in the words of one of my good friends, jizz worthy. This is definitely a special occasion type place though ($$$).

Brazil Arts Cafe is a good place to go eat some authentic Brazilian food and watch soccer games. Not very expensive either!

Mesa Verde is all vegetarian and vegan food. I was pleasantly surprised by it. The jack fruit chorizo with blueberry chipotle tacos were amazing and I never felt like I wasn't eating something meaty and satisfying.

Cielito's I've been to once. It was tasty Mexican tapas. It was spendy but going during happy hour made it better.

Places that I haven't tried yet but have heard good things about: Blush, Black Sheep, The Hungry Cat, Finch and Fork, and Zaytoon.


Hope your food endeavors in SB go well!"
"I'm highlighting the fact that the vast majority of university rankings published today will be given in terms of a post-graduate metric, in this case research score. I have yet to see an infographic similar to OP's relating to undergrads."
No bugs yet for me and the combat does take time getting use to but i found it to very immersing.

"yes, but for your situation, I think ram is more important.  You aren't gaming, or doing anything that would necessitate a high powered graphics card. While I believe a macbook pro, would suit your needs, I actually own a laptop which would be suited for school. a thinkpad nano, with the i7, 16 gb of ram. weighs less than 2 lbs, and is very easy to carry, long battery life, and with a 65 watt GaN charger, you can take it anywhere."
And that *does* seem like a reasonable request.  Especially for Mother's Day.
TY!
Also the degree seems to not mean much by itself. I have hired a hand full of graphic designers and have never once asked if they have a degree. I only care about their portfolio and work ethic.
"Thank you very much, it was really helpful."
"Hi Legos. I'm very impressed here. This was a lot of work, especially replying to everyone.

Would you take a quick look at this? Ryzen 7 5700U with 16gb RAM. Assuming I can get this for $550...From what I've seen, it seems like it'd be hard to beat. Would you jump on this, or may I have better luck finding something better for the price? Battery and weight are not important to me. Thanks!

They bill the card every $1000.
"Well just about anything related to Ubuntu or Debian will also apply to mint.  It's a more noob friendly version of Ubuntu which is a noob friendly version of Debian.

Obviously more to those steps but it sums it up well imo."

"I have an Anker 10k PD Redux myself. 

The Nitecore NB10000 looks nice as does the Anker Nano for your desired purpose. (I haven't used Nitecore's powerbank but enjoy their headlamp)

I recently found out from a pack shake down that the [Zendure A3PD](https://www.amazon.com/Zendure-10000mah-External-Portable-Nintendo/dp/B07H9YS4D2) exists. No experience with Zendure though and no idea how much that thing weighs. I bring it up because it claims to support pass through charging. This is a feature that was removed from many reputable brands of power banks I believe due to lowering the overall life span of the battery cells? (Anker for isntance) However if that is the only problem and it really has the advertised capacity/speed and one was ok with sacrificing potential longevity for pass thru charging on the duration of a thruhike it might be worthwhile? Can't speak to the quality of the build/if it is even built to match advertised capacity/weight/the brand actually standing behind them. No name battery banks have been notorious in the past for having fake cells full of sand every ULr's worst nightmare?"

But thst’s not why I use them.  Their servers are reliable and support is really good as well.
