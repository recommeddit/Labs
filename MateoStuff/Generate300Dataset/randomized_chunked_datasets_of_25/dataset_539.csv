53631,best medicine for a cold,"This is probably gonna get buried, but you should add a liver warning on acetaminophen. It is **incredibly** toxic if you can't properly metabolize it, and should **never** be taken within 24hrs of alcohol or if you have impaired liver function.

It is a seriously dangerous chemical that people treat like candy."

70416,best major to study in college,"I work at a medium size marketing company (150 employees), only about ten people here have a degree in marketing.  Most of them are MBAs or English majors.

The best way to make your degree pay off is to not have to pay for it.  Any degree you pay for completely with scholarship money is going to be worth it.

The next way is to get a degree that doesn't cost much.

A vocational certificate in electrical, AC, or plumbing repair will give you a good paycheck for very little investment.

An associate's degree in nursing, dental hygiene, or radiology will also give you a good paycheck for very little investment, and better working conditions.

A bachelor's degree in engineering, accounting, finance, nursing (again), statistics, economics, or business.

A master's degree in pharmacy, physician's assistant, MBA, or any of the master's version of any of the bachelor's degrees.

PhD's aren't worth it if you are just doing it for the money."

57633,best cologne,"You have to go try them on yourself, and maybe get a friend to come with you. Different scents work for different people.

People have said they like floral & fresh on me. I've tried the oriental fragrances and they smell like aged piss on me. I use Giorgio Armani ""Acqua di Gio"" simply because I can buy it at Macy's for like 50% off with coupons. Call me basic, it's ok. I like it and it's not offensive to people."

57222,best water brand,"Quality is a tricky word. Do you mean purity or something like chemical tuning? The clearest vs the best tasting? Harder or softer? Acidity? Is it quality alone or also price to volume?

They do have different “flavors”, the taste of the special blend of minerals added. Some folks prefer the taste of some over others.

Acidity is generally not a significant factor. High pH (low acidity) water doesn’t affect body pH with a single exception of stomach acidity. High pH might help you a tiny bit if you have acid reflux or indigestion but the same effect could be achieved with a Tums or Rolland.

There is a minimum standard of purity for bottled water in the USA. All waters should easily be better than or on par with the most drinkable of tap waters. 

I’ll give you my direct option: 

>Find a water that is reasonable price per quantity as well as an enjoyable flavor. The banding itself doesn’t matter, it’s more about enjoying what you like. My preference is on a larger quantity then price then higher pH. 

My go to was this $2 1.5l high pH with a dark blue and green label, can’t remember the name. It had a slightly dead taste to it, refreshing if cold but effetely neutral when room temp. Otherwise, it wasn’t noteworthy outside of being one of the cheapest price to amount ratios in a (large) bottle size at the high end supermarket I used to work at. 

Was it overpriced? Yes. At something like 4.50 per gallon, it was expensive. Was it something I enjoyed? Yes, I prefer my water that way. Did I do it all the time? Hell no, I might get it once a week, when I needed a small pick-me-up at work.

At that point, the water becomes like any other drink: enjoyment or entertainment. It’s no longer just about guzzling sustenance."
