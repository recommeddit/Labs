26086,best politician,"It also depends on what you mean by respected. There are plenty of politicians that are respected by their own party.

(Well that is a simplification but basically right) It is only thorough a historical perspective (and people who disagreed with him dying off) that he became universally loved. 

I was just trying to find examples that were respected by the majority of Americans as well as internationally. (At least if the statues of Washington and Lincoln in the UK are any indication)"
