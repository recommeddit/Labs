Out of the other, more well known rankings, US News has them at 49, and WSJ/Times has them at 83 (including LAC's). So they miss out by a little.",best college for research
30439,"The Burns documentary is fine, but if you're truly interested in learning about the Civil War and Reconstruction (which I find far more interesting than the war itself) check out David Blight's lectures on Open Yale Courseware.

It's essentially like taking a course at Yale from one of the most prominent Civil War scholars without the tens of thousands in tuition. I can't recommend this series enough, you'd have to spend hundreds and read for months to get the kind of knowledge blight gives in only 20+ for absolutely free.

https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/blob/HEAD/LIMITS.md has a full list of the differences between it and the browser.

There's chatter of bringing `window.fetch` to Node.js core too at https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19393 which is getting very positive feedback, so choosing anything else at this point with `fetch` slowly becoming ubiquitous seems almost like a misstep.",axios alternatives reddit
72554,"The fact of the matter is, as it's been repeated multiple times, you should use the ones you enjoy. At the end of the day, no amount of in depth analysis of actuation force and rise time and other metrics make a difference in the vast majority of usecases. Even if you're a pseudo-serious gamer, it's highly unlikely that you're at a competitive level where these subtle differences will make a major detriment between wins and losses.

The point I'm attempting to make is that many, many gamers will emphasize things like hardware, fps, or even character selection as the reason they are winning and losing when in actuality, the raw technical skill is far more important in nearly all spheres except the highest levels of competitive, professional play.",best keyboard switches

38177,"I mean... Is your Google broken? It's one simple search, but I guess I'll just copy and paste for you. Haha. Here: 

https://www.google.com/search?q=which+is+better+infinity+war+or+endgame&oq=which+is+better&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l6.4518j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

If you search ""Which is better Infinity War or Endgame,""on the front page (without clicking next), there are 8 result articles... 6/8 lay out what I think is solid reasoning how Infinity War is superior. So that is 75% of op-ed pieces by both fans and critics because some are from reputable publications and others are things like Reddit. To me, it is the Episode V of the MCU. 

HOWEVER, inconsistent to that, I found that on Rotten Tomatoes, Endgame edges out Infinity War with 93% over 84% and then the audience score is basically the same for each although Infinity War is barely ahead by a slight margin so I find that pretty interesting... Infinity War shows a ten point spread over Endgame on Metacritic though and also edges out the IMDB score by a margin... So out of 4 things: Rotten Tomatoes, the audience score for RT, IMDB, and Metacritic, Infinty War is ahead in 3/4. 75% again... At least I'm able to show my work! Hahahaha",best Marvel movie
