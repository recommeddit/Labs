"Love it! Always good, and it’s pretty ☺️"
If you can go over that budget settle for something like Sennheiser HD800s[HD800s](https://intoptrend.com/best-headphones-reddit-2021/). These are better sounding headphones and for sure you can gain a lot more if you are using an amp.
And https://technitium.com/dns for those that don't want/have a pi. Still in development but fully working. They just added a DHCP server not too long ago.

"Assetto Corsa for road racing and Dirt Rally for, well, rallying. In VR of course."
I only read our local paper in print--because the Web site is horrible. My issue with print papers has nothing to do with technology. I just don't like the really big pages and all the jumps.
So the ketchup goes on the bacon sandwich or that’s separate?
Christopher Nolan’s second best movie after Inception imho
"Silicon case, pretty good in aspect but magnet lint unfortunately. :/"
"USC and Cal are both listed as #22, so there's something slightly off about the tally."
Xf270hua IPS 1440 144 loving the great colors. Also has freesync.
"> Now I keep most walls neutral or light/subtle, and let artwork, furniture, etc. have the overwhelming colours.

Also, when you want to sell the house, it's a hell of a lot easier to put the art/furniture/etc in storage and stage neutral art/furniture, than to have to repaint the walls."
"I have heard praise for this film endlessly. I don't doubt that it is a good film, but I feel like I have seen enough drug documentaries in my life - quite a few about the 80's cocaine subject. On the other hand, I am pretty curious as to why this film seems to stand head and shoulders above the rest. I'm sure it will hold my attention, and that I will probably end  up enjoying it, I just can't seem to ever press play on it."
"I'm currently painting my house with Kelly Moore Premium Professional interior. I can't speak to how well it's going to hold up long term yet, but I'm really happy with the coverage I'm getting from a single coat over primer.

I'm spraying, though - not sure if the result would be the same rolling it."
"An uncle of mine made loads of money, but that meant little because he hated his job so much he eventually committed suicide."
And no real focus on the actual roster. It's like Kanye decided to be DJ Khaled rather than Rick Ross with the MMG projects.
"an activity! someone else mentioned bungee jumping, but that money could get you a day trip to hike somewhere cool, or you can spend it gradually on museum admissions, concert tickets, etc. OR take a class on something weird you've always wanted to learn: pickling, how to make your own candles, or recreational birdcalls. fuck if I know what your secret passions are. get out there and do something! :)

enjoy your Benjamin."
"It's between Fight Club, Memento and The Prestige."
Superb list
"The Hilton in Chicago.  It was lovely, the staff was considerate, professional and accommodating.  It may very well be a small thing but for the first time in my life I sent out dry cleaning. I received the item back first thing the next morning and I felt extremely spoiled.  I might be confusing two hotels but I think they gave us cookies at the front desk also. I was traveling a great deal between Dallas, Chicago and New York at the time so I may have the cookies confused.  Either way I felt like a queen."
There is a reason sites like sci-hub are so popular.
Now imagine you *major* in CS!
"I just watched The Great Hack last night and thought it was well done. It’s about Cambridge Analytica’s rise and fall, their role in the 2016 Trump campaign and Brexit (the latter of which I had no idea was connected)."
Amazing game. Best of the generation in my opinion.
