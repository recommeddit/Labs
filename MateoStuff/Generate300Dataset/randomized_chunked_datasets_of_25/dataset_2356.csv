69358,best major to study in college,"I wouldn't change my major (CS), but I would have dropped all the random classes I took in favour of Chinese for four years instead of one."
47782,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,No love for the TI-86?!
4027,best online college,Just to clarify.  The bachelors does not meet NSA CNSS 4011 only the masters program in information security & assurance.  Don't know if that's a big deal to some when choosing an online bachelors program but thought I'd throw it out there.

8916,best toothpaste,"While I'm thinking about it this is a question I've had for a long time.

On the front of toothpaste (in the USA) it says ""Fluoride Toothpaste"" but if you look at the back it says a different active ingredient which I can't quite remember but I'm sure you know.  ~~I think it's sodium pyrophosphate from a quick google search.~~  Edit: It's Sodium Monoflourophosphate.

Why, if Fluoride is the most important thing, does it not show the active ingredient as Fluoride?"

41434,best instrument to play,"Well basically, you never stop learning. There is always some hard piece that is too difficult for you. But with dedicated practice you can be playing some beautiful pieces after 2-3 years. Maybe longer maybe shorter. It really depends on how much effort you put into it, your teacher etc. Most important thing imo is just playing as regularly as possible, atleast when you are starting out. It definitely sounds like you want to play piano, it's a beautiful instrument, I'd say go for it."
13975,best research paper archive,"Cool, I kind of did the same thing, except the subreddit was for papers that I thought was interesting. It's only been in existence for about 2 weeks though. Will subscribe to yours. :)"
24054,best anime,"I can't speak for OP but I think Naruto, before Shippuden, had this special charm to it that's hard to describe. The characters and plots were simple enough for kids and newcomers to anime to understand, but the story didn't feel shallow (besides the obscene amount of filler). When Shippuden started, I felt like they wanted to cater to a more adult audience and introduced all these convoluted and interconnected plot lines and it was missing that charm from the first series. Also they started adding too many characters to care about. The original Naruto reminds me of all the time I spent when I was younger talking to my best friend about our favorite characters or story arcs and how we would act out fight scenes on his trampoline (we were lame I know). I personally wouldn't outright put it on a list of ""must see"" anime, but it's good for what it's trying to be."

26936,best board games,"Okay 3 years and Gloomhaven still is considered number 1?  I haven't been able to pull the trigger on paying for that game since it feels like it's going to be another Twilight Imperium in that I play it 1 time maybe in a year, but generally it's on the shelf for 2-3 years before I find people who want to invest time in it."
41545,best instrument to play,"I googled what the most versatile instrument would be because I had a feeling it’d be the drums. Google frequently finds quite good discussions via Reddit. Almost a reliable source. 
That’s how your question popped up. 

Too bad you didn’t pick up any instrument. But we’ve all been fooled by momentary motivation. 
Shit i sound old. 

See ya"

57754,best cologne,"Granted she was quite drunk but that happened haha, it's great because while others think it's played out l, where I'm from I'm the only one wearing it and I've to buy it online, so when guys here girls compliment it they ask me what it is and I tell them, they ask where they can get it and I say 'oh it's online, not in shops around here' so that kinda puts them off and keeps it scarce."
