19439,best YouTube video,I read that with his voice
52840,best hiphop album,Book of Ryan flew under the radar somehow imo. This is a really powerful project from one of the best.
71698,best movies with a cool twist,"The twists in Fight Club, The Village and Shutter Island are all a bit predictable imo."
23098,best celebrity,Because Bill Clinton never forgets a bitch!
64454,Best Nike running shoes,"Boost is so much better than lunarlon it's incredible. But not all boost shoes have the same type of boost as others (weird, I know). The ultra boost is the best and most comfortable boost shoe I've tried on. My friend has a pair of Boston boost that he loves though and they seem like they would be more suitable for running!"
43709,best items under $100,As a working musician I hate Spotify. As a human being who wants a quality service I love Spotify. My only gripe is with the mobile versions of the app. Some versions have features that other versions don't and all versions are missing a lot of elements that the desktop version has. Even then the PC version is glitchy so you can't win either way.
42546,best detective show,Dexter!!
13144,best gifts for mom,You won't go wrong. Promise. Merry Christmas!
53067,best hiphop album,His discography is great plus the live performances have so much energy! 10/10

28909,best breakfast foods,"Scramble a bunch of eggs and cook them in a muffin tin with liners, when they are done bag them and tag them, (ziplock, label, fridge), you can add cheese, meat(cooked), or veggies to your eggies before cooking if you like."
69589,best major to study in college,I understand that you are the machine
9724,best dorm hall at UCSB,Nothing. Best god damned time of my entire fucking life. If I could go back I would do so in an instant. Enjoy every second of it. It will probably be one of the last times in your life when you won't have to worry about eating or cleaning.
18940,best YouTube video,"Sci-Fi short - [Abe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xovQcEOdg8)

Horror-ish short with a very Twilight Zone feel - [Still Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La6T8Bq6CsU)"
21398,best workout music,I usually have [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJdMjRHRLfg) on repeat. Arnold is such an inspiration.
10628,best suitcase lock,TSA locks are the worst locks in the world.
26932,best board games,"You know, generally I would recommend Forgotten Island as gateway to Pandemic, because it shares a lot of core mechanics. If she has already played Wingspan though (which is fairly complex imo), she will probably be fine."
55548,best action and adventure novel series,I read the whole thing. I'm still not convinced it was all that great.
59797,best perfume,Oh god yes. I wish it weren’t so expensive. I use it incredibly sparingly. Anyone have any cheaper recommendations similar to it?
34153,best NFL player,"That's the beauty of this game - no clear, outright winner. Good question though; I'd give the nod to Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, or Jon Blackwell."
60503,Best comedy show on Netflix,New Girl for sure.
31040,best country to live in,"I’m biased (like everyone) but I’d say Australia and NZ are very high up on the list. The only unfortunate downside is the cost of real estate - which is unsurprising given the number of people that want to live here. 

Safe, excellent healthcare, excellent education systems, fair legal system, great opportunities and stable western political systems. Hard to get into if you can’t meet the skilled migration requirements, though."
46842,best hand santizer brand,"Nope.

Hand sanitizer may be good at killing germs, but for overall cleanliness, the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/cleanhands/) recommends soap and water:

>It is best to wash your hands with soap and clean running water for 20 seconds. However, if soap and clean water are not available, use an alcohol-based product to clean your hands."
51618,best iphone case,They are. I so wanted the R2-D2 one giving the message. But no lie they are all fucking sick! Bobba’s is sweet and so is the all white Storm Troopers one and the 2 different styled Vader ones. Really hope they have a collection for the 11 pro.
