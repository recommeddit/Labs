"Here's a back asswards answer.

My dad works as a flight attendant for united and he had Bam Margera on his flight. He said he was one of the most polite, kind, and patient people he's eve had on a flight. Apparently he even denied any alcohol that was offered on the flight."
Van Hoesenberg from Adirondak Loj. 15 miles and yes 12 hours too. I was holding my son back on the way down but there was nothing I could do. One step at a time. Definitely hobbling on the way down
"I support all the ideas of ""time away!"" I'd also suggest a gift cert to a local store they enjoy shopping at/malls/etc and maybe with their favorite drink/coffee/ etc. Just stuff they like to do alone that they can't get the opportunity.

OR give them a day (without the money) alone and you get the house scrubbed professionally.  Like ""I got you this Coffee and a day alone and don't come home until 4pm because theres another surprise"""
"I've run over 17,000 miles in Nike shoes (mostly Pegasus) in the past 10 years. They seem legit to me."
"**DO NOT BUY OR USE THAT STYLE OF LOCK.**

They are extremely easy to unlock, requiring no effort or guesswork.  By applying downward pressure to the locking ring, pulling on it as you would to open it, you force the dials to stop rotating at their ""unlock"" position.  Basically all you'd have to do is pull on it, turn the dials until they stop, release tension and pull again.  I learned this lesson young at summer camp when the counselors found all the shit I smuggled in that I wasn't supposed to have (it was all candy and soda.)"
"Lumber, siding, rocks, bricks/pavers, mulch, insulation, drywall, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, paint, roofing, cabinets/countertops, flooring..."
SB law states no one shall be made aware of brophys until the 8th year of their residency.
"Indeed. I love the small features like the blue led lighting, better cable management hole, frame rate counter, and swivel base."
"This movie is the ultimate mindfuck, I loved it so much. Triangle is another one like that."
Parts of it definitely still do. Other parts have gotten a lot better since the 80's. :)

"I LOVE sage green... My husband, on the other hand, is not a fan. What a weirdo!"
"Huh, never had that problem, works just fine for me. I'm using it currently."
I like ancient sounding music so this [ancient lyre replica from Mesopotamia sounds mesmerizing](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4QRxsZhjg) And the link in the description is [pretty interesting also.](http://www.peterpringle.com/silverlyre.html)
"The Crying Game.  It was amazing when it came out because no one gave the ending away to anyone else before they saw it.

edit:  If you want to watch it, just don't read anything about it before hand"
"I would go with Genshin Impact, for reasons already said by one poster.

Also rans: Eve Echoes, Infinite Lagrange, Second Galaxy, Arknights, Honkai Impact 3rd, Perfect World Mobile, Dragon Raja, Super Mecha Champions."
I second Magic Maze.
"The higher you go, the more force you gotta give to the blowing, with cold focused air (instead of a warmer air when blowing lower notes). Gotta harden those abs when blowing !"
"Obviously. But not every baggage handler in every airport has one of these. Since I'm trying to prevent really low-effort opportunistic theft (of clothes, shoes, etc), this still makes sense for me."
I’ve heard crest strips are good but you can’t get them in the UK. Otherwise; go see your dentist and have them bleached professionally. Wouldn’t bother with anything you can buy from the supermarket.
do they protect the edges as well?
"Will do, we haven't had any yet but we may be lucky. Feedback from techline has been watch anything not  out of the Mexico factory in regards to refrigeration. I guess they've had a greater than normal failure rate."
From Dusk till Dawn is another left turn out of no where.
"So it’s kinda like this: there’s a difference between antibiotics and sanitizer.

Let’s think about if you wanted to wreck someone’s car: you could do a small targeted attack (cut a brake line, drain the fuel, ruin the steering). For every strategy you choose, they can improve it (locked fuel door, etc). You could also take the less glamorous approach and just completely destroy the car baseball bat at midnight style. 

That’s what alcohol does, it’s the crude style, it’ll always work, and you can’t really stop it."
">Sometimes add raisins for a treat


What a sad, sad life."
