When I first tried it, I was really taken with it, but then my roommate made the connection to a cleaner that's common in malls/restaurants in the Middle East, where we both used to live, and I can't unsmell it. I actually just busted out my sample of it when I saw this, and it's still amazing (though I'm still haunted by the mall bathroom association).  If I had a top 30, it'd be there.",best perfume

3732,"This index is based on reasearch scores. I suppose that the chilean universities focuse more on the reasearch work than in the education, that´s why they are so overrepresented. UBA it´s for sure a top 3 university in LATAM, but the research work over there isn´t the greatest, because most of the public reasearch in Argentina it´s carried out by the CONICET, and the pubic universities focus on the educational prospect.

I´m not informed about the peruvian sistem of universities, but if i had to guess, i suppose the same is happening over there.

In conclussion it´s a nice index to meassure reasearch works, but it´s not so good at the time of meassuring which are actually the best universities around the world (developing an index to measure a concept so abstract as what makes a University better than others it´s not a easy task).",best college for research

29339,"The NES or Genesis. The NES does deserve to be number one, since we probably wouldn't have consoles today without it. It was my childhood console in the early 90s. Almost everyone I knew had one.

The Genesis was truly amazing for the time. I unfortunately didn't own one at the time. Instead I had an NES, but a friend had a Genesis and I remember playing over his house and being completely blown away by the ""High Definition Graphics"". It doesn't seem impressive today, but the Genesis was a powerhouse back in it's day. It came close to arcade graphics which was incredibly impressive.

Edit: Just realized you said this gen, but mentioned the Xbox 360 and Wii? You should make your title more clear. It's very confusing.

The Switch so far is my favorite console. It's probably the most innovative console since the Wii. I love being able to take it on the go. Being able to play SNES and NES titles is also a huge plus for me.

The Xbox One and PS4 don't peak my interest at all. The Xbox One is my least favorite, due to the lack of exclusives. I have a PC, so it really makes it completely pointless for me to own one. The PS4 isn't bad, but again nothing interests me.",best game console

That said, I personally think LibreOffice is much more usable and closer to Excel and integrates well with the rest of the office products, and runs on Windows/Mac/Linux.

Calligra is also an open KDE option that runs in Linux/BSD.",best spreadsheet editor

54669,"Stay away from Zerowater and Brita. The filters are tiny and way overpriced. Buy a plain pitcher to store your water in the fridge and fill it from one of these that just screw onto your faucet, no installation required. 

&nbsp;

You can start out with a single counter top water filter and use your choice of at least 50 different filters in it. You can get commercial quality filters for this style that will last an entire year for under $25 online. If you have special filtering needs (want to remove fluoride or bacteria?) you can get a double filter counter top version.

You can get these units for much cheaper on eBay and buy filter(s) of your choice. This type of filter is an industry standard size.

&nbsp;

If you want the cleanest water at home I suggest a reverse osmosis counter top system. The initial cost is much higher but you are receiving a better filtered water in return.
