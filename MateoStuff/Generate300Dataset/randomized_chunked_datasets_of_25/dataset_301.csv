22811,"Nicest - Marie Osmund. My ex-girlfriend used to babysit her kid. I met her on some riverboat party that she was hosting for something. She was lovely.

Coolest - Dave Grohl. Had some beers with him in Las Vegas. I asked him if her was playing in town, and he said ""No. Just hangin' out."" So we drank beer and talked about stuff.

Worst - Dr. Phil. He was berating some waitstaff in the ""high roller"" room. In her face, screaming, red-faced.... He saw me giving the disapproving stare and screamed ""What are YOU looking at?"" I said ""A piece of shit"", then walked away.",best celebrity

39166,"I think we can not avoid that we use ""free"" products and the coin exchange it's our data (personal behavior) but we can decide -setup what settings we can let them see and what other they mustn't have from us.

Every website have tracking cookies: Google analytics cookies, comScore cookies, omniture cookies, Adobe analytics cookies, double click ad cookies...... So you're afraid of the browser but every page you visit it's collecting info from us.

In other hand, you don't use chrome but you use Gmail...it's the same thing.. you're part of their third party data for ads.

You don't use chrome but you use extension from chrome webstore or extensions from Firefox store. It's the same, you let them collect some information within the extension

I think you need to search / decide what browser let you work fluently smooth with your browsing habits. That it doesn't kill your computer/laptop from a lack of memory or high cpu process because of the amount of tabs.

I was a big a fan of Firefox but it started to kill every machine I used because it was a great consumer of resources

I've tried Vivaldi, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Brave

Vivaldi it's my personal hope  that they can  fix  the buggy and slow issues they have to become my default browser. The custom GUI, the web panels ( a floating version of a Mwebsite in the side bar of the browser) and the extension handle from both stores chrome and opera are my motivation to move to this browser.

Opera in other hand it's right now my default browser. I use a lot of extensions and alot of tabs for office and personal projects. It has also the option to install extensions from chrome store and opera store. The GUI it's not bad but it's faster vs other browsers with all the stuffs mentioned before.

I don't know man, we can not hide to prevent the privacy stole of our personal data at all. In that case disconnect from internet. Become an island we no internet. As I mentioned before just check / manage what settings you let them see, also in extensions there's a extension that it's called police extension and guide you to know if your personal data it's save or not",best web browser

23693,"Dirt Rally.  Picked it up about 30 seconds after it appeared on Early Access and has been my go to for the last 2 years for racing.  The career mode is just about perfect in terms of progression and style.  Probably the hardest racing game I've played.  I've ""beaten"" the game I guess, as in finished a few seasons at the master difficulty level, usually coming in 2 to 4th in points, and I've yet actually win an event.  I'd happily continue playing for years with more cars and stages.

For those in the PNW, Both the Oregon Trail Rally and Olympus Rally are coming up in the next 2 months.  I highly recommend spectating at least.  Oregon Trail's Friday night stages at Portland International Raceway might be the easiest rally spectating in North America.",best car racing video game

62110,"If you like shooting then Borderlands. Itâ€™s so so amazing and other than BL3, you can get all refinements and DLCs with previous BL games. The correct order of playing is BL1 > The Pre Sequel > BL2 > BL3. BL1 is a little off putting because itâ€™s the oldest (thereâ€™s a remaster available) but it shows itâ€™s age. It got on me after couple of hours and I didnâ€™t want to stop playing it and the other parts. Hours and hours of running and shooting around the open world and finding loot.

Edit: not that BL3 is any bad. Itâ€™s the best of the series imo. But there are 2 season passes. One is for DLC campaign and the other for extra content. Iâ€™ve yet to check them out.",Best RPG game on PS4

I have no idea why because he knew well that I didn't drink either. It was such a weird present but mum told me that he took her to 3 shops trying to find the exact right thing. So the set of mugs became one of my favourite gifts because he put so much (muddled) thought into it. And yes, I cried.",best gifts for mom
