22811,best celebrity,"Nicest - Marie Osmund. My ex-girlfriend used to babysit her kid. I met her on some riverboat party that she was hosting for something. She was lovely.

Coolest - Dave Grohl. Had some beers with him in Las Vegas. I asked him if her was playing in town, and he said ""No. Just hangin' out."" So we drank beer and talked about stuff.

Worst - Dr. Phil. He was berating some waitstaff in the ""high roller"" room. In her face, screaming, red-faced.... He saw me giving the disapproving stare and screamed ""What are YOU looking at?"" I said ""A piece of shit"", then walked away."
45839,best trick or treating candy,"HELL YEAH: Snickers, Reeses, gummies (any kind), Twix

FUCK: Tootsie Rolls, candy corn, Twizzlers, Junior Mints, York Peppermint Patties"
40214,best midrange CPU,7C/14T are available to developers.
67437,axios alternatives reddit,"Proper error handling. Making assumptions that your end points will be always returning what you are expecting is foolish. Secondly, it returns javascript object, not JSON. So that's a little bonus. Cannot timeout. Does not allow to cancel request. Forget upload progress bars and no cookies by default."
39166,best web browser,"I think we can not avoid that we use ""free"" products and the coin exchange it's our data (personal behavior) but we can decide -setup what settings we can let them see and what other they mustn't have from us.

Every website have tracking cookies: Google analytics cookies, comScore cookies, omniture cookies, Adobe analytics cookies, double click ad cookies...... So you're afraid of the browser but every page you visit it's collecting info from us.

In other hand, you don't use chrome but you use Gmail...it's the same thing.. you're part of their third party data for ads.

You don't use chrome but you use extension from chrome webstore or extensions from Firefox store. It's the same, you let them collect some information within the extension

I think you need to search / decide what browser let you work fluently smooth with your browsing habits. That it doesn't kill your computer/laptop from a lack of memory or high cpu process because of the amount of tabs.

I was a big a fan of Firefox but it started to kill every machine I used because it was a great consumer of resources

I've tried Vivaldi, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Brave

Vivaldi it's my personal hope  that they can  fix  the buggy and slow issues they have to become my default browser. The custom GUI, the web panels ( a floating version of a Mwebsite in the side bar of the browser) and the extension handle from both stores chrome and opera are my motivation to move to this browser.

Opera in other hand it's right now my default browser. I use a lot of extensions and alot of tabs for office and personal projects. It has also the option to install extensions from chrome store and opera store. The GUI it's not bad but it's faster vs other browsers with all the stuffs mentioned before.

I don't know man, we can not hide to prevent the privacy stole of our personal data at all. In that case disconnect from internet. Become an island we no internet. As I mentioned before just check / manage what settings you let them see, also in extensions there's a extension that it's called police extension and guide you to know if your personal data it's save or not"
8480,best toothpaste,You have been banned from r/pyongyang
14391,best romantic novel,I love all of yours except for Iâ€™ve never heard of Simple Wild. My library has it and it looks fantastic!
1965,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Woodstock's Pizza in Isla Vista is the only great one I've found nearby.
6390,best Netflix documentary,"I haven't watched many of them but I'd put Nanook of the North for his importance. Also, for a recent one, I liked 13th on Netflix."
17864,best Kardashian,"Khloe is my favorite come at me ðŸ˜‚ and Kim of course. Cait did Kris dirty, making her my least favorite. Kylie is also annoying but I love her skin care and make up lines. Kendall is boring and a brat."
69402,best major to study in college,"Yup. In journalism, your grades mean nothing compared to the real-world experience and connections you gain. Newspapers don't really care about your grades, they care about your skills and motivation.

In MBA and law, same deal. MBA is basically a gigantic networking degree. Law, you are not going anywhere if you haven't laid the path ahead of time. Those are the only degrees I can speak on."
23693,best car racing video game,"Dirt Rally.  Picked it up about 30 seconds after it appeared on Early Access and has been my go to for the last 2 years for racing.  The career mode is just about perfect in terms of progression and style.  Probably the hardest racing game I've played.  I've ""beaten"" the game I guess, as in finished a few seasons at the master difficulty level, usually coming in 2 to 4th in points, and I've yet actually win an event.  I'd happily continue playing for years with more cars and stages.

For those in the PNW, Both the Oregon Trail Rally and Olympus Rally are coming up in the next 2 months.  I highly recommend spectating at least.  Oregon Trail's Friday night stages at Portland International Raceway might be the easiest rally spectating in North America."
3816,best college for research,Forbes is the clear outlier here.
36640,best alcoholic drink,Like the White Claw hard seltzers? I had one at my state fair this summer. Perfect for if you want a bit of a buzz but still want something refreshing on a hot night.
59434,best perfume,"Obviously from its #2 spot, I think it's awesome.  It's a big tarry smoke note (some people say leathery, but idk), heavy incense, wood, with some spices (black pepper, the notes say licorice, I get clove as well).  It feels very moody and dramatic to me. If you go for smoke and dry incense/wood stuff, it's a must-try."
64892,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,I feel you! It was a quick go to for me for ever before I moved. Their Tri-tip is awful by itself but I do like their Tri-tip sandwich and chicken by itself.
23721,best car racing video game,"You know, I bought that game when it came out and only have 26 minutes of playtime and for the love of me, I can't remember why I shelved that game."
38289,best newspapers to read,"New York Times â€¢ Washington Post

Also, NPR, but that's radio."
62110,Best RPG game on PS4,"If you like shooting then Borderlands. Itâ€™s so so amazing and other than BL3, you can get all refinements and DLCs with previous BL games. The correct order of playing is BL1 > The Pre Sequel > BL2 > BL3. BL1 is a little off putting because itâ€™s the oldest (thereâ€™s a remaster available) but it shows itâ€™s age. It got on me after couple of hours and I didnâ€™t want to stop playing it and the other parts. Hours and hours of running and shooting around the open world and finding loot.

Edit: not that BL3 is any bad. Itâ€™s the best of the series imo. But there are 2 season passes. One is for DLC campaign and the other for extra content. Iâ€™ve yet to check them out."
17083,best iOS game,"Flick kick is like that, not as artful as tiny wings but fun repetitive simple/one-handed gameplay."
12567,best gifts for mom,"Yep. My son went out with my mum to buy me a present when he was about 7. He was fixated on the idea of buying me a nice tea cup or coffee mug. I have no idea why because he knew well that I didn't drink either. It was such a weird present but mum told me that he took her to 3 shops trying to find the exact right thing. So the set of mugs became one of my favourite gifts because he put so much (muddled) thought into it. And yes, I cried."
15969,best sunglasses for fashion,I bought some Randolph Engineering Aviators and I think they're definitely worth it. Also they're not made by Luxotica so that's a bonus
13412,best spreadsheet editor,"This might be a bit obtuse to the question, but why not use something like csvtk or pipe it to column.

For eg:

`csvtk pretty -r -s"","" < input.csv `

should give you an right-aligned columnar table in the terminal.

Other-wise, just:

`cat file | column -t`

But yeah, other than this I tend to use Libreoffice :)"
50614,best rap album,GRoDT and the Black Album
47339,best state to visit in the United States,"Dallas is great but it's not really an entertainment, tourist-focused city. We do have a sports team from every major league (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS) and basically every touring musician stops at Dallas at some point. There's some good museums and the Fort Worth stockyards are pretty cool."
