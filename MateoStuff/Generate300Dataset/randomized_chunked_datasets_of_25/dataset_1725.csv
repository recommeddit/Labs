20252,best workout music,"I got a double wide, and I rode a plane."
49194,best gaming monitor,"Tbh, last IPS I got from LG looked like shit. Grainy and visible vertical lines at max refresh.  Still have it because I could not return it.

I had an Acer also, for a short period before returning. That was some kind of horror movie. Huge discrepancy in brightness between upper and lower part of the screen.

A monitor can be quite expensive and manufacturers pass intentionally subpar panels on the market because they are labeled as ""gaming"" and that's supposedly the main feature. A convenient excuse.

I don't have the time and will to hunt for a good unit. So,  with LG and Acer I have personal experience they slip garbage on the market. Never gonna buy from them again.

I will trust Dell/Alienware. Never had a problem."

54699,best water filter,"I used the Pur faucet attachment for a couple of years but finally stopped because it wasn't a perfect seal. It would drip when you turned the water on (in non-filter mode) and spray water up and to the side if you turned the water up to higher pressure. I even bought a few different gaskets over the years to try to get it to stop, but they never worked completely."

26845,best board games,"I just wanted to thank you for mentioning Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion. I didn't know this was a thing. Nothing quite like having a $200 40lb board game sitting on the shelf because I don't know where to start lol, I'll have to check it out!"
65987,best college in california,As a banana slug I am le sad lol
65824,best college in california,"FAFSA and Cal Grant are there for low income house holds. California has the cheapest in-state tuition of any state in the US. There's always private loans as well. 

My parents didn't make a lot and I got some decent help from the government, but I graduated Cal Poly SLO with only 10K in student loans, which honestly I probably could have cut out if I lived a lot more frugally."

58310,best cologne,"This is, without a doubt, the sexiest cologne I've ever had. I always get compliments on it when I wear it out. My fiancee still compliments me on it when I wear it. It smells like you're going to get laid."
13848,best research paper archive,"If you're looking for a more modern paper, [Takahashi and Yamanaka paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16904174) on iPS cells  is a good one, especially if you want to teach methods/concepts used in current research. This is a paper that played a pivotal role in the stem cell field. Classic papers are good; methods and concepts are important to understand, can be demonstrated and largely accepted. The Yamanaka paper is a classic paper of a currently, still evolving, and (somewhat politically) controversial field. The series of studies presented in the paper are really tour-de-force experiments."
12264,best gifts for dad,"My dad is a ""prepper"". Stocks up on ammo and guns and stuff like that. Says I should buy silver to use for trade when the economy collapses. I'm not here to debate any of that but to say I found the perfect gift for him. For less than $30 I got him a solid ounce of silver in the shape of a .45 Acp round."
16013,best sunglasses for fashion,"Maui Jim makes the best lenses too! All my sport glasses are Maui, and I have a few fashion pairs from them that I like too."
47336,best state to visit in the United States,"Minneapolis feels surprisingly east coast like in the way the city is laid out and run, but the people are definitely straight up Midwest.  We've got football and ice hockey for sure here!  Also, a lot of Immigrants live here, and they brought a lot of great food, which might be part of why it feels a little more east coast to me.

Although, if you want to see a good game, maybe go to green bay.  It's actually quite a nice city, and quite a bit smaller if that's something you're interested in.  I personally like the bigger cities, hence living in Minneapolis, but, if you're trying to get a picture of america, you need to remember that a lot more of us that Europeans live in smaller cities, towns, or completely rural.

It's been asked here before, and overwhelmingly people find Ohio to be the most generic state.  Not in a bad way, but they have a little of everything american.  I don't know if there's a specific city that I would suggest visiting, though.  I personally liked Cleveland a lot, though.  It has a surprisingly good theater and music scene, along with good food, although not very international at all.

If you want to go to a specific city that does a good job at capturing a lot of different aspects of America I might suggest Omaha.  Super underrated city IMO.  It's got a little Midwest, a little Western, and just a tad southern, but not much at all.  It's a bit smaller too, so not overly touristy."
