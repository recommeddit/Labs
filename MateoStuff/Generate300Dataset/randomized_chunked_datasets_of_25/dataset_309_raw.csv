"I don’t know why people would risk damaging their several hundred if not thousands of dollars of equipment to save $15 on certified cables from known and reputable vendors. $2 seems shady af, not to mention it came from aliexpress. Yeah, you had it coming OP."
"I have been on the sprint BYOD for $5 with autopay and $15 insurance (somehow still under $20 on my bill) but the promo is over in a few days so am looking for a new plan. Really I have had good experience with Sprint but in my home it can be a bit shady with only 1-2 bars.

Registered nurses make a lot (2 year associates degree). Finance degree (never not going need that). Civil or mechanical engineering for obvious reasons. Chemistry majors tend to end up in the pharmaceutical industry (unsure if you'll actually need a MS degree later instead of just BS degree). Business management degree.

When it came out it was free for a whole day. I stood in line in front of BR for 4 hours for it and by the gods was it worth it.
"I just purchased the Pixio PX277 Prime it is a 27” ips panel, 165hz refresh rate, and scored high for Hardware Unboxed, i will come back to this thread when I get it set up this week. It was $329.00 on amazon"
