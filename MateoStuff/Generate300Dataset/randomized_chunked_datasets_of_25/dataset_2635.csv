Saying ‚Äúno brand wars‚Äù but spending your time pointing out differences is what creates brand wars.

No one needed to discuss Tesla.

What‚Äôs been obvious for a while is those who dislike Tesla the most bring it up at every opportunity.

36765,"Depends on the situation. Most of the time I get a local beer, usually a kolsch, weiss, or amber (though I've recently developed a love of New England IPAs, whereas normally I'm not an IPA fan).  If I'm not getting a beer, I stick to a few basics that are usually hard to screw up:

&#x200B;

A glass of red wine. As long as it's not super cheap swill, red wine is usually a good option.

&#x200B;

Scotch and ginger. Two fingers of scotch with a splash of ginger ale.

&#x200B;

Vodka sour or whiskey sour. A staple at pretty much any bar, near impossible to screw up if the bartender has any experience.

&#x200B;

Mojito. If I'm feeling summery or eating something tropical/latin then this is my usual go-to.
