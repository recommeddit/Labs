16976,best iOS game,"Hey there, new to the sub. Just wanted to say thanks for the list. Hope to see more on here, for many genres"
33559,best electric car,"My point was that it doesn‚Äôt need to be discussed. I didn‚Äôt say it was an attack.

Saying ‚Äúno brand wars‚Äù but spending your time pointing out differences is what creates brand wars.

No one needed to discuss Tesla.

What‚Äôs been obvious for a while is those who dislike Tesla the most bring it up at every opportunity.

This is a post about the Id4 let the comments celebrate the car"

5306,best home improvement store,Mcmaster bones you on shipping though.
59488,best perfume,"A social worker with the money to buy fragrance? I don‚Äôt buy it :-P haha. For real though, dealing with the stuff social workers have to deal with counts as an artist to me."
31292,best country to live in,Technically it is Norway. They score high on pretty much everything.
63086,Best online React course,"Totally agree, I‚Äôve done a few of the Udemy courses and Maximilian‚Äôs is by far the best. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more."
64534,Best Nike running shoes,"I'm a huge fan of the Wildhorse 3, it's a great trail shoe for more technical trails where you're going to be needing the rock plate and aggressive traction. The cushioning makes 4-5 hour days on the trail comfortable and you go slower on the trail anyways so I don't mind the extra weight."
70473,best major to study in college,I love my CS kinfolk! They're arrogant in the childish way that you almost want to believe half of the stuff they're saying.
47829,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,I‚Äôd recommend learning how to graph on matlab. It only should take you 20 mins or so to learn the basic code required to graph most things you might want and it‚Äôs significantly more versatile.
56592,best desktop monitor,"1080p 22"" to 1440p 27"" was a huge upgrade for me and 1080p 27"" monitors look terrible to me."

29550,best game console,"Halo's all I was on 360, I played the shit out of all of them. I've been faithful to pc for 3 years now, but still miss halo 3 and Reach more than any other game on console. So either, i'm going to have to wait until the very unlikely event of MCC coming to pc, or dig up a potato and enjoy some good ol' lan/splitscreen with my mates."
17201,best iOS game,Coincidence! I was just playing soda dungeon on my chromebook.
58568,best cologne,DRAKKAR.
36765,best alcoholic drink,"Depends on the situation. Most of the time I get a local beer, usually a kolsch, weiss, or amber (though I've recently developed a love of New England IPAs, whereas normally I'm not an IPA fan).  If I'm not getting a beer, I stick to a few basics that are usually hard to screw up:

&#x200B;

A glass of red wine. As long as it's not super cheap swill, red wine is usually a good option.

&#x200B;

Scotch and ginger. Two fingers of scotch with a splash of ginger ale.

&#x200B;

Vodka sour or whiskey sour. A staple at pretty much any bar, near impossible to screw up if the bartender has any experience.

&#x200B;

Mojito. If I'm feeling summery or eating something tropical/latin then this is my usual go-to.

&#x200B;

MaiTai. I go to Hawaii for a work convention every year. This is my go-to drink pretty much anywhere I go in Hawaii."
24359,best anime,"TTGL is one of my all time favorites, but I was shocked to see it so high up given changing tastes over time"
23823,best car racing video game,"Project Cards, Assetto Corsa or I-Racing(this is one can get expensive).  

 You can also go the ps2 emulation route for Gran Turismo 3/4 if you want as well."
19866,best workout music,Meek - Ooh Kill Em
33694,best electric car,"Yeah, looks like the Tesla is the only option with a comfortable margin on the distance. The new drivetrain would definitely do it, 370 mi range vs a 281 mi drive."

52421,best hiphop album,Don‚Äôt think GKMC should be here. Lacking Ready to Die...
12245,best gifts for dad,"Similar to this, one year I gave dad a personalized calendar with pictures of him and mom when they were young, the family over time, etc, and added important family dates like birthdays to it"
44588,best items under $100,"The All American Association Against Acronym And Abbreviation Abuse Anonymous group is not a group that you join, it's more of a collective of like-minded individuals."
34550,best NFL player,"That, and the game was a bit different back then. His time wasn't huge, but his influence was."
