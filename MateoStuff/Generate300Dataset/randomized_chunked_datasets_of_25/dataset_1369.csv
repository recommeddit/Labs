73626,best battery bank,"You can use a million. Lots of brand recommendations here. 

What info you really need is that you need one that does USB C PD - or Power Delivery. Stick to options with that and you will be fine. 

All pixels, newer iPhones, and some new Samsung's I think all use USB C PD. What's important there is that reg usb c on a power bank, will either charge a pixel slowly, or not at all and you'll think it's broken. It's not. It's just a different and newer/more specific standard. Pixels do not Support Qualcomm Quick Charge in any gen. So that's useless for you. 

I use Anker, EasyAcc, or Aukey. But any number of brands are ok. I'm a pixel 3 user and was a pixel 2 user. So I have lots of experience. I've also been using power banks for around 8 years. So I've experience in the space."
