32410,best vacation resort,"Agree with comments on avoiding Sandals....Not just for a girls trip, but any trip. 

We’ve been around the Caribbean, and most of the all-inclusive deals have been underwhelming with the exception of Cocobay in Antigua, but it’s geared towards couples also.

Went to East Bay Resort on South Caicos last August and it was fabulous. Basically like being on a private island and beach. Accommodations are condo style and the price was really good. They have an all-inclusive option, but we ended up saving money not doing it.

The staff is great and the place is pretty new. Check it out on social media."
29148,best calendar tool,"You might find [NotePlan](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/noteplan-markdown-calendar/id1180443101?l=en&mt=8&at=1000l3&ct=rdd) interesting. It’s technically a very powerful Markdown-based calendar. It works well with macOS and iOS, and if you use IFTTT then you can actually automate a lot while always have a complete picture in your NotePlan and your Calendar. It’s available on macOS as well, [NotePlan for macOS](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/noteplan-markdown-calendar/id1137020764?l=en&mt=12&at=1000l3&ct=rdd)."

34436,best NFL player,"Like I said, I'm not knocking Brady at all.  I'm just saying from a highlight perspective you'll always remember the Catch or the Jerry Rice touchdown with barely any time left against the Bengals in the Super Bowl.  Brady's comparable plays are the Tuck Rule play, Vinitieri kicking a game winner, or the defense making an interception.  It's strictly circumstantial and really only affects the eye test if you factor in biggest moments."

72919,best Linux distro,"You have to realize that a lot of those people don't even know that much about this sort of thing. It's fun as a newbie to just install it to feel cool for a bit, realize you're way in over your head, then drop it.

That's usually how it goes."

995,best ice cream flavor,"People were certainly willing to pay a lot for spices in the past, and they made a lot of people wealthy and powerful...I've heard that one supposed reason that spices were so valuable was that in a world without refrigeration, people tended to eat a lot of meat that would be considered rotten by modern standards, so having spices to cover up the taste was a pretty desirable thing.  

Now me, if I'm thinking about what would be good to stock up on for barter in a post-industrial society, I'm going to go with drugs.  Or even better, the equipment and precursors to make them.  Stuff like antibiotics and opiates would be incredibly valuable.  Even something basic like Imodium could be life-or-death in some circumstances.  If we're talking apocalyptic wasteland levels of societal breakdown, stimulants like meth or even caffeine would be pretty valuable too."
