12091,"So there are ways to go about it without asking them directly - usually it involves both thought and splurging. If you're going to buy something hobby-related, you want to shell out extra money otherwise they will probably already have whatever it is. 

For instance, I had a leather guitar strap custom made for my guy. He is a huge Led Zeppelin fan so I had LZ quotes tooled into it along with his own symbol. He said it was the best gift he had ever received.

53576,"As a primary care doctor I just wanted to say great job OP. I don't know if you're a doctor or pharmacist or what, but this list and the advice in general is great. 

As to when you should stop self-treating and see a doctor make sure it's not a bacterial illness needing antibiotics, I think the following symptoms would be reasonable thresholds to seek treatment for cold-like symptoms: fever (measured with a thermometer), shortness of breath or cough for more than 4 weeks. Even with these symptoms viral illness is still the most likely cause, but the possibility of bacterial infection is high enough to warrant a checkup. Of course if you're older than 65 or medically complex get review earlier as bacterial infections are more common in this case. 

As a side note, if you do see a doctor but worry about antibiotic overprescribing, it can help a lot to mention to your doctor that you'd prefer to avoid antibiotics if possible. Many doctors feel that patients will be upset if they don't get antibiotics, so telling them upfront will take this pressure off and allow them to make a rational decision as to whether you need them or not.",best medicine for a cold

You're not alone. The ESLs love their semicolons and commas. Who the fuck needs a period when you can make one big paragraph using semicolons and commas?

It's words on the screen for a word count. oh, and don't forget to give us a history of the thing from Wikipedia first and use like half the content for that because getting to the point in the last paragraph is super cool.",best free online grammar checker
