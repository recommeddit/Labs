12662,best gifts for mom,"> I think we got part A of the story. And I think we got part Z of the story. I think parts B through Y would provide context that would make everything make sense.

How do I immortalize a Reddit quote?"
45007,best items under $100,"There are lots of smaller, local brands around as well as bigger ones like Thinx. I have pairs from both Aisle and Revol. Revol are much cuter, but both are super comfy and so much better than pads, tampons, or cups."
72281,best adblocker extension,"I'm referring to uBlock Origin Extra, not uBlock Origin."
17386,best iOS game,"Casual go-to’s are: Card Crawl, Hue Ball, Morels, Kenomo Mahjong, Juicy Realms, Good Sudoku, Alphabetty Saga, Solisquare, FAIF. 
Favorites are Dungeon Raid, Robosockets, Super Drop Jam, Hero Slide, Sword & Poker, all gone. Hoping GameClub will release them. Also Ridiculous Fishing before Vlambeer abandoned it. 
Would recommend Peak’s Edge, Mini Metro, Solitairica, Frost (card game), Jaipur, The Firm, Chip Chain, Horizon Chase, Highway Runners, Missile Cards, Dungelot, Card City Nights, Slay the Spire, Fidel, Hipster Chess, Black Paradox, Six Match, Drop7, Domino Drop, Swap Sword."
60321,best freezer brand,"I'm single and have no use for another freezer. My freezer (part of my fridge) holds enough for one person. Besides I eat a lot of Greek yogurt and that's where I get at least 40% of my protein. 

When I did have a chest freezer when I was married I found we lost a lot of items to freezer burn because we would forget about them, and they'd get lost in the bottom. A chest freezer just didn't work for us. 
A smaller freezer allows me to find stuff easily, and lose less food."
62182,Best RPG game on PS4,"Just be aware the gameplay can be really frustrating and clunky. Story and graphics are great, but it's not fun as other RPG's generally are."
25812,best cricket teams of all time,"Completely agree with this. From around the time Sobers got going, the West Indies went from ""strong"" to untouchable. What made it even more intimidating is that no team had dominated the game in quite the same way till then. 

In sports, it often takes a team or a player to prove something is possible and then a bunch of others follow. I'd say the Aussies of the 00's may never have happened had the 70s and and 80s Windies not shown that that level of dominance was possible"
50489,best rap album,"Paul's Boutique..I don't think samples have ever or will ever be flipped like that again

that shit is amazing, each song has an experimental but very rock/boombap feel"

60586,Best comedy show on Netflix,Derry Girls for sure. It is a travesty how unknown this show is
40887,best instrument to play,"Lol from your post I can already tell  you that regardless of what you play, you'll seem like a douche trying to impress women"
67627,axios alternatives reddit,"They don’t have to help. It’s free and they don’t have to accept any responsibility, at all. It even says it in their MIT license. The license is there for a reason."
41103,best instrument to play,I think the problem with trumpet is that it's really hard and you have have to be really good to get laid. With guitar you can get laid just by holding one.
47659,best state to visit in the United States,Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha. Consistently rated one of the best zoos in the world. You can spend a whole day there and still not see everything.
47690,best state to visit in the United States,"Petit Jean is one of my favorite places. Love the history, the beauty, and the view of the river. I'm not from Arkansas but whenever I take people there who haven't been, I make it a point to go to Petit Jean and do the overlook, the falls, the bear caves, etc."
955,best ice cream flavor,"As far as I know you can still get Dole whip at Disneyland, though it’s been a while since I’ve been there so I’m not positive."
24380,best anime,AIEEEEEEEEEEE DAE THINK AOT TOP 10 FOR SURE???? AIEEEEEEEEEE s*creeches*
28184,best breakfast foods,"I'll give it a try, but sweet potatoes have never done it for me. Who knows, maybe this will change that."
46334,best trick or treating candy,"1. Whichever kid takes the most candy slingshot-ed point blank in the face without crying gets that many pieces of candy.
2. You hold the bowl as close to your crotch as possible then let them take it out of the bowl.
3. Buy some insulin for every 10 pieces of candy. You should buy 25 bottles of insulin and give them to kids with the candy.
4. Chase kids near your house, slingshotting them with candy while telling them to grab some candy from your crotch/bowl.
5. Stay until their parents come to the door asking what the hell is happening.
6. When you run out of candy provide them with a trick, when they come to the door and yell ""trick or treat"" go to the door and collapse. Hold your breath for as long as you can and then get up and close the door. 
To prevent TPing place bear traps throughout your yard and sling shot the Tpers with rocks. 
I hope this advice helped and that you will have an awesome halloween

This one was surprising.. But the compliments have been stunning:

3893,best online college,yup. what i was wondering as well
68507,best science fiction novel,"I actually preferred *Fall of Hyperion* the best, but it's really a continuation of *Hyperion*, so I treat the two books as essentially one.

The two *Endymion* books were fine--not as good as their predecessors, but fine books in and of themselves.  I've read many other books by Simmons--*Illium* and *Olympos*, *Drood*, *The Hollow Man*, etc....  Most were interesting/good.  I how no issues with Simmons' writing, other than perhaps the tendency to overreach his plotlines, which can lead to somewhat disappointing ending--I'm thinking specifically of the ""battle of the Gods"" implied at the end of *Olympos*.  But perhaps I was expecting too much--how can a mere human write a convincing battle of Gods."
52749,best hiphop album,"My list always changes but here are the most consistent I could think on top of my head in no particular order.

- Nas - Illmatic
- Madvillain - Madvillainy
- Quasimoto - The Unseen
- J Dilla - Donuts
- Ghostface Killah - Iron Man"
36777,best alcoholic drink,"Happy birthday!

So when I first started drinking I stuck to very sweet drinks like Malibu+coke/lemonade, various flavours of Sourz, and vodka+orange squash, and then in my early 20s I'd moved onto things like snakebite (beer+cider), Jagerbombs (Jagermeister+red bull), and tequila shots. I do not necessarily recommend any of these if you're trying to be classy/fancy - save these for when you're trying to be very drunk.

For a nice, lowkey kind of drink, spirits and mixers are a good shout! Vodka can be mixed with almost any soft drink, I like gin best with lemonade and rum with coke. Cider is tasty (Swedish brands like Rekordelig make really good flavoured ciders, but apple is good too!), and I'm very picky about beer but I've found a couple that I like.
