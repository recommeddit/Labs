When I did have a chest freezer when I was married I found we lost a lot of items to freezer burn because we would forget about them, and they'd get lost in the bottom. A chest freezer just didn't work for us. 
A smaller freezer allows me to find stuff easily, and lose less food.",best freezer brand

In sports, it often takes a team or a player to prove something is possible and then a bunch of others follow. I'd say the Aussies of the 00's may never have happened had the 70s and and 80s Windies not shown that that level of dominance was possible",best cricket teams of all time

2. You hold the bowl as close to your crotch as possible then let them take it out of the bowl.
3. Buy some insulin for every 10 pieces of candy. You should buy 25 bottles of insulin and give them to kids with the candy.
4. Chase kids near your house, slingshotting them with candy while telling them to grab some candy from your crotch/bowl.
5. Stay until their parents come to the door asking what the hell is happening.
6. When you run out of candy provide them with a trick, when they come to the door and yell ""trick or treat"" go to the door and collapse. Hold your breath for as long as you can and then get up and close the door. 
To prevent TPing place bear traps throughout your yard and sling shot the Tpers with rocks.

68507,"I actually preferred *Fall of Hyperion* the best, but it's really a continuation of *Hyperion*, so I treat the two books as essentially one.

The two *Endymion* books were fine--not as good as their predecessors, but fine books in and of themselves.  I've read many other books by Simmons--*Illium* and *Olympos*, *Drood*, *The Hollow Man*, etc....  Most were interesting/good.  I how no issues with Simmons' writing, other than perhaps the tendency to overreach his plotlines, which can lead to somewhat disappointing ending--I'm thinking specifically of the ""battle of the Gods"" implied at the end of *Olympos*.  But perhaps I was expecting too much--how can a mere human write a convincing battle of Gods.",best science fiction novel

36777,"Happy birthday!

So when I first started drinking I stuck to very sweet drinks like Malibu+coke/lemonade, various flavours of Sourz, and vodka+orange squash, and then in my early 20s I'd moved onto things like snakebite (beer+cider), Jagerbombs (Jagermeister+red bull), and tequila shots. I do not necessarily recommend any of these if you're trying to be classy/fancy - save these for when you're trying to be very drunk.

For a nice, lowkey kind of drink, spirits and mixers are a good shout! Vodka can be mixed with almost any soft drink, I like gin best with lemonade and rum with coke. Cider is tasty (Swedish brands like Rekordelig make really good flavoured ciders, but apple is good too!), and I'm very picky about beer but I've found a couple that I like.
