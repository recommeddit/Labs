"Sorry, my expertise ends at knowing how to spell 'caries'.

FWIW, from what I've heard from my dentists regarding a pretty fucked up tooth I have, the answer seems to be 'no'."
"Wonderstruck Enchanted by Taylor Swift. My SO said that when a girl/women walks by with this scent it makes him miss me because its my scent xD. Also noticed that every time I wear this perfume, my man gets more aroused and I get lots of complements from people :)"

"1. The Last Hour of Gann by R Lee Smith (TW: proceed with caution - multiple rape scenes)
2. What the Wind Knows by Amy Harmon
3. Angelfall by Susan Ee
4. Overture by Skye Warren
5. Cottonwood by R Lee Smith

The first one was easy - fav book of all time. What do they have in common? They all have a thread of fantasy to them, really(except for Overture by Skye Warren). Some kind of adventure, or story. Made up creatures and made up lands. I would reread all of these books. There are other books that were really excellent but I wouldn't consider a favorite because it just wasn't memorable enough. I consider a book a favorite if I still think about it months and months after reading. I've read sooo many amazing books. It's hard to narrow it down to such a small number!"
I switched from ranger to `lf`. Its like ranger but noticeably faster.
"Not sure why anyone would claim there's nepotism at the UCs, and I go to a CSU. They serve different purposes. CSUs prepare people for good jobs. UCs do that as well, but have more of a focus on scientific research."

"Use firefox or Vivaldi, nice browsers and are very private browsers something that every chrome users need! Brave is also nice browser but many people say that it is not a very privacy specific browser! Firefox new proton ui is a lot nicer and many users are switching to firefox!"
"Met him in '07 after a show during his Straight Outta Lynwood tour and 12 year old me was so star struck, I couldn't stop looking at my hand after he shook it."
That's what happens when you make a great product that solves a problem.

That rampart AMA was pretty special.

I’ll name a few 1) silk pillowcase 2) humidifier 3) a suction cup to go over the overfill drain in the tub. It gives me a few extra inches of bliss to soak in.
"Ive recently recieved an artisan classic zero mid and before that ive always used qck+ heavy and since i play a lot of csgo i just couldnt get used to the artisan, it felt way to fast and hard to feel comfortable on.. how so?"
Yup! Tygar is it! Women just love the scent though I’ve gotten compliments from gay men too. lol

"I just gotta say, I dont know you so take this with a grain of salt.... but statistically you are probably not allergic to any antibiotics. More than 90% of people who think they have an allergy to antibiotics are actually reporting a symptom of what they are being treated for. (Saying that azithromycin makes you cough, when its the pneumonia that actually made you cough)

Then, of the remaining people who do have a
Drug reaction.... it almost never is an allergy.  Its usually a side effect, which is very different than an allergy. (Taking aspirin causes heartburn)

You should go see an allergist, because if you ever get truly sick and end up hospitalized, if you tell someone you are allergic to every antibiotic, you’ll wind up dying of something very treatable. Get allergy testing done officially."
"Honestly axe isn't bad, just gets a bad rap from teens over spraying. The company employs some top noses when making those formulations.

Dark Temptation is an A*Men clone, while Bond No. 9 copied Axe Peace when creating Scent of Peace."
"*The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath* By Lovecraft.  It's short, epic, and I read it often."
