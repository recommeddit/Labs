70545,"To be more specific, here are the highest paid undergrad degrees:

1. Comp Sci / Software Engineering
2. Electrical Engineering
3. Petroleum Engineering
4. Mechanical Engineering
5. Industrial Engineering

Of those, only comp sci / software engineering isn't extremely heavy on math.  And you still need to be able to do some math to get through the program, plus to be any good at it you need to be able to think *very* logically.

Law / Business yea, but that's not undergrad.  Law is getting crowded, yes.  If you go to a good regional school and get top 10% or so in your class you'll do fine.  But that's not undergrad.  So, same concern as psych there, that you'd need more schooling (professional school not grad school, but same deal).",best major to study in college
