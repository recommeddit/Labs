36877,best roller coaster at six flags,You may want to check a map before trying that order. SFMM is a very large park and it also has some very big hills to climb. I'd choose a more methodical approach around the park rather than a run back and forth across the entire park between each ride approach.

5746,best programming language for web development,Could also use Javascript through the Node.js framework for backend but otherwise this is the best answer here by a long way. Personally I chose Ruby on Rails because it had the best free learning materials online.
50628,best rap album,"I'm going to throw a curveball here.

A Tribe Called Quest- Midnight Marauders was one of my choices... but I've come to the conclusion that..

De La Soul- Stakes is High . First De La album without Prince Paul on the boards... and it beats everything that he's produced. Covers many sounds of hip hop, and has aged better than fine wine."
