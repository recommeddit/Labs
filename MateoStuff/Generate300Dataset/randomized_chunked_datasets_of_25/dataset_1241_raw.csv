For me it was LiPo jumpstart pack. Just under $100. When I first saw how small and light it was I thought no way this will work. Have jump started my truck from dead several times over the years. Stays fully charged for 6 months. I canâ€™t count how many times I have used this to save me or other people.
"I'd say go for the HarmonicDyne Zeus. Big soundstage and good imaging, great for gaming and music and movie watching, it's a good option. It costs $350, however."
"Not a detective series, but the best series Iâ€™ve ever seen is The Americans."
Use them both.  Compare prices and items and use the best one.
These are deciduous trees and will give very little privacy in autumn and winter.
Portland and Seattle. They are both awesome with good public transportation and the are close together
If you're already using fetch there's no reason to switch to axios. The only thing it can do that fetch just plain can't is upload progress tracking. Everything else is basically a QoL addition.

This was so lovely to wake up to this morning. Thank you for sharing this.
"Mos Def & Talib Kweli are Black Star 

Illmatic

The Low End Theory 

Honestly the new Tribe is creeping up there, it was easily my AOTY but I'm still listening to at least half the tracks every day. It's a fucking fascinating album to me."
"Similarly, every other one of Jon's songs and The League."
I stayed there too. Enjoyed it so much I changed my flight time back to England just to make the most out of relaxing. Totally worth getting a flexi ticket.
"Iâ€™ve personally switched to zebra as my full time package manager and itâ€™s nice. I would say it can be a bit buggy, as it is still in beta but itâ€™s way faster. I also feel like it isnâ€™t the smoothest as Iâ€™ve tried sileo and for some reason when installing tweaks it feels so much smoother. If zebra could get that down it would be amazing."
Plus the Po Valley.
"Oh god, I don't know. Oceans and dolphins and rainbows? With a little bit of citrus or crispness to it, I guess? I'm not good at describing things like fragrance and wine. It smells good, trust me. But only in moderation, too. All things in moderation. I find there are a lot of douches who pile the stuff on, and that automatically invalidates its power."
