"well since they are the most widely supported club on the planet its pretty obvious MOST of the supporters aren't from Manchester, doesn't take away from the fact that probably 3/4 of Manchester is red.  And yes i am from Manchester and yes im a United supporter."
But its not great when some peoply try to hype one of the newer ones just because they have no other option or they generally hype everything which is new...

I have found Lowes/Sherwin-Williams partnership brand FAR superior to the reformulated HD Behr Paint.  Behr used to be terrific paint, but HD ruined it."

"My Dads bday is right after Father's Day every year, last year was his 60th. His girlfriend asked him what he wanted and all he said was, ""for all my kids to be in the same place so I could see them together."" He lives in San Diego. I'm in Colorado, my bro is in Seattle and my sis is in San Diego too. But not too close to my dad... We all pulled our money together and moved mountains to make it happen, and when he saw us all there at his surprise, my father, someone who has never cried in front of any of us, buckled to the ground in tears. It is legitimately the thought that counts."
"A bunch of favourites that I would check out not on your MAL or anilist. Openings/trailers are linked to give you a feel for the show.

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series with animation that holds up amazing well today. It also had one of the best endings in anime in my opinion. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well-regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that.  (recommend the dub as a sub watcher)

- Redline (2009) Adrenaline the anime. Film is just basically about this massive death race and has some of the best animation ever.

[Redline Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t26m_Q6ENo)

- Mob Psycho (2016) Action comedy about a psychic boy and his mentor a con artist fighting other psychics and the various spirits that plague their city while he learns to grow as a person.

[Mob Psycho 100 OP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lpApXzwAP0&index=2&list=FLsNBO_i0YOwmyoaxjB-AZ7g&t=0s)


- Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) Teens are forced to fight for the survival of mankind against monsters known as Angels. Quite a few themes like a look at the writer's ongoing depression play a huge role in the series (make sure you watch the film End of Evangelion for the ending)

[Neon Genesis Evangelion OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU21rCWkuJw)

- Shirobako/Bakuman (2014) (2010) An anime literally about making anime and an anime/manga about making manga and all the ins and outs of both industries.

[Shirobako OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_46zFe7lwRM)

[Bakuman S2 OP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkEQ58iMmNg)


- March Comes in Like A Lion (2016) Deals with a pro shogi player (Shogi is like chess though there are a few differences) dealing with depression and overcoming it. This one is another favorite but it’s a slower anime so just be open to the fact. It also has some wonderful side characters and can be quite funny at times. The shogi scenes are also really good even if you don’t know the rules since the focus is on the psychological battle between the two characters and Shaft really did a lot of great work on the imagery.

[3-Gatsu No Lion S2 OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvOK6DiZw1M)

- Ghost in the Shell (Film 1995) (SAC 2002) Film is more philosophical taking a look at human consciousness and what it means to be human. SAC is more of a straight up crime drama.

[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG  OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0)


- Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (2016) Really good period drama about the art of rakugo (a form of theater/storytelling) and the various characters attempts to preserve it from the various hardships around them as well as use it as a source of confidence and identity.

[Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu S2 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1HjJfGt_xk)

- Made in Abyss (2017) Kids have to survive in a descending pit as they ward off the many things that want to viciously murder them. Some amazing world building and beautiful movie level backdrops and animation and world building down to just understanding how the ecosystem of the abyss works. (warning does have some graphic content involving children viewer discretion is advised)

[Made in Abyss Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4gyYjpL4ME)

- A Silent Voice (2016) Deals with redemption group think, bullying, living with a disability and suicide. Film has some awesome shots and an unbelievable soundtrack. I would also read the manga after finishing it (as the movie skips over stuff).

[A Silent Voice Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfK6UgLra7g)


- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) A great epic space opera with a conflict focused on a corrupt democracy fighting an enlightened despot. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book of 10 original has covered all. My advice watch the two prequel films My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War (skip the first two episodes of the main series after seeing the films overture covers the first two episodes better) then the original OVA, Gaiden and then the remake.

 [Legend of the Galactic Heroes OP 3]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hryo6H57y6I) 

- Psycho Pass (2012) A cyberpunk detective story and one of the better villains I have seen in anime. Has some interesting views on society mainly dealing with the issue of an over monitored  state. I would say it’s like Minority Report if you have seen that movie. 

[Psycho Pass OP 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Q4emwDFYg&index=1&list=PLAbghykhSTZPNEqvWnC8ZuAEU_PazwJZm)

- Ping Pong the Animation (2014) Great sports series about aspiring Ping Pong pros and the hardships they go through great animation and music with a very different rougher art style that looks great in the matches. Incredible character development in a very short 11 episode span.

"I can’t agree with this more. I was a CP cast member at WDW and we have to buy our shoes and they have to fit “Disney look”. Most of the oldies had expensive Timberlands that I couldn’t afford as a broke college kid so I bought these cheap boots because I thought that would suffice. Turns out, walking around Disney constantly combined with driving the old Safari trucks (the floorboards would heat up and helped to melt your shoes) meant that the boots I bought barely lasted a month. Ended up calling my parents for money to buy a good set of boots and they last the rest of my program. Don’t underestimate a good pair of work boots. 

Same can be said for character shoes (a type of dance shoe usually preferred by directors and choreographers in theater). A good pair of character shoes can last years and be the difference between being able to walk the next day after a performance or having to soak your feet in Epsom salts to bring down swelling and just general pain."
"If you’ll be taking notes a lot, MATTE! I’ve been using matte screen protector since I got my iPad. At one point, I tried glass protector, but I went back to matte after a week because it was super slippery and I hated the glare."
