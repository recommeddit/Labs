"manowar - Kings of metal

I definitly recomend metal music"
"Both of these lists are bullshit: with the exception of the top 2 or 3 on that ''best'' list, none of those are things you major in, they are things you go to a trade school for. On the flip side, I disagree with Liberal Arts, Drama & Graphic design being the ''worst''. If you bust your ass and you know what you want you can get more than those salaries as well. The person who wrote this article doesn't know much."
"Old spice. Yum.

Nautica makes a delicious cologne for men. It's my favorite."
Microsoft's binary still has other tricks up its sleeve
"Oh man I love turtles so much. There's one at a pet store near me and he's so social, always follows you when you walk next to his tank. I feel sorry for him he needs some company

What's the silliest thing either of your turtles have done?"
"Thanks, I'm pretty sure I've heard that series mentioned on here quite a bit. Isn't the author a contributor on here or something?"
Maybe I need to go back now that I'm an adult. 16 year old me just thought it was a bunch of rocks. I'm kinda ashamed of myself
ok leftist.
"That's the problem. I don't have the ability to do that, funds, etc."
"I'd say Law-abiding Citizen.

That reveal that HE was the one doing everything, that no one was helping him, and he'd accounted for being in any random solitary confinement cell blew my mind."
"Plus you have to get to the airport at least an hour, probably 2 hours, before the plane takes off so thereâ€™s that"

"Silica is the same thing as silicon dioxide, see above posts."
"Interesting, around Boston AT&T and Verizon are pretty close but head up to NH or Maine and Verizon comes out way ahead."
">Why does every single one of those sound like it was recorded off of a landline from 1960? Its always this horrific quality that you can barely understand. No phone sounds like that anymore

So that's the gotcha. Landlines are still using the legacy frequency ranges we have used for a century. Additional digital compression may be added by the phone company and phone system the radio station is using as well. They may also filter some frequncies as well if they can be problematic like hiss or background hum.

HD voice sounds great on modern phones. But if you are not calling an HD voice enabled line, which is pretty much every landline, you are falling back to older cellular voice codecs, which are far heavier compressed then landlines. This could be as new as ones introduced with 3G in the 2000s, but Verizon for example, still falls back to the CDMA codecs they used in the mid-90s and was designed for 2G, and as a result, sound absolutely horrid.

So you are hearing the result of legacy cell phone compression, on top of landline compression, on top of radio station phone system compression. That may be genuinely what the phone call sounds line once it reaches their equipment."
I'm glad to hear you found it useful.
"I know growing up, our hamsters would immediately chew their way out of the cool looking plastic cages with all the tubes and crap they sold at the petstore.

It kinda sucked because I really wanted my hamsters to be happy with all neato tubes and shit to climb but nope..they'd chew out EVERY SINGLE FREAKING TIME."
