3902,"And you are qualified to make that determination how?  No offense, but some folks have no other choice but to go online.  Dismissing their resume out of hand because of where they got their degree seems a bit uppity. 

For instance, I worked two jobs supporting a family while going to school online.  What I learned there was as academically challenging as any B&M school would offer, if not more.  I got a degree in business, Project Management, and was able to pass the PMI CAPM and PMP tests on the first try within the following few months.  I also kick ass at my job.  

Biggest difference between B&M and Online?  My son is going to school now.  He touts the ""Social experience"" and ""Collaborative environment"".
What?  Binge Drinking at Frat Parties?  I'm 50 years old, own five houses and served 22 years in the Army.  Earned 5.2 Million dollars for my company as a contractor, and the fucking HR filters wouldn't get me to an interview until I had a BS degree.  

Just about pisses me off when someone says that going to a Brick and Mortar school while being a twenty something single kid with parents and financial aid paying the bills is harder or somehow more  challenging than keeping a roof over a family, working 60 hours or more a week to replace the 100K job you lost, being a father and a husband, and having to properly research and cite every thing you write, meet weekly objectives, papers, projects, postings, all properly researched and cited.",best online college

I've used both extensively.  If you want the most reliable/consistent cell experience in FL AT&T is the way to go, if you want something overall that's still pretty good and can give great speeds, T-Mobile is it.

37181,"Disney and Knotts will be closest. 

Disney is, in my opinion, the best but itâ€™s also the most expensive and the tamest. Really close to Santa Ana though. You could do Disneyland *or* California Adventure or do both in one day with a Park Hopper. Lines havenâ€™t actually been too and since capacity restrictions lifted, but the *big* popular / new things (Spider-Man in DCA, Rise of the Resistance in Disneyland) require some early morning planning. Good food options, much better if you guys are both actual Disney fans. We used to be annual pass holders when that was still a thing but have gone a few times recently and it was still very fun, despite no fastpass. 

Knotts is, in my opinion, one of the best options for the money. It has the kitschy ghost town area, lots of food, some roller coasters, and itâ€™s pretty affordable. Pretty fun, imo. Still pretty close to Santa Ana. Weâ€™re also passholders here. 

Universal is fun *but* imo itâ€™s some of the worst value only because almost all of the rides are simulators. I will say: lines have been short af, Jurassic World and Harry Potter / Forbidden Journey are great, and there are some unique experiences here (specifically the tram tour). More expensive. Tame rides. Farther from Santa Ana but not out of reach at all. Weâ€™re also passholders here and go quite a bit, at least once/week. It is a more unique experience, compared to the next oneâ€¦

Six flags is great *value* if you like roller coasters but is by far the least unique experience (imo) because well, itâ€™s Six Flags. Itâ€™s fun - there are a ton of thrilling rides, itâ€™s inexpensive. Pretty bad food and a far drive from Santa Ana. If you guys are all about roller coasters and not theming, this is the one, but in *my* opinion itâ€™s the worst lol. We still have passes for this one too though, only because theyâ€™re so goddamn cheap, but as far as a unique experience this ainâ€™t it. 

SeaWorld (all controversies aside) is fun - there are some smaller roller coasters, obviously the sea life, and some actually okay food and drinks. Itâ€™s also pretty, and the weather is good. Downside is that itâ€™s pretty far and you *do* have to be into the sea life stuff to really get your value - which may include some of the marine mammal stuff which can get uncomfortable for some. Imo itâ€™s better when thereâ€™s a food festival. Honestly Iâ€™d skip it though, to be honest. 

All in all if you guys like Disney IP and donâ€™t mind spending the extra money, Iâ€™d go with Disney. I think itâ€™s the most unique (very different from WDW in my experiences), memorable, and quintessential, but if you guys will be bored with the tamer rides then you may consider one of the others.",best amusement park
