48998,best gaming monitor,"I originally bought the vg27aq but there was an issue where a few pixels in the top left of the screen displayed the image from the bottom right of the screen. I went through 3 of these monitors before deciding it must be a firmware issue and ended up returning it. Afterwards I bought the lg27gl850, and it provides identical picture quality with no issues whatsoever."

68270,best science fiction novel,"-Armor by John Steakly: This got me into scifi

-Council Wars by John Ringo: probably the most realistic vision of the future I've ever read

-Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis: one of the best commentaries of current events

-Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson: A masterpiece. This combined with the Ringo books is our future. Also makes me incredibly suspicious of any plans to colonise Mars. 

-The Ringworld books by Larry Niven: I like the idea of being so bored with being old and rich that I go on crazy adventures to alien artifacts.

-Tom Strong by Alan Moore: it's a comic and it's a great treaty on morality and virtue."
10497,best suitcase lock,"When I expect to be in crowded areas/lines (airports, tourist attractions, etc) while wearing my backpack, I just use a paper clip or twist tie to close the zippers together.

15242,best tree for the garden,"I taught horticulture and landscaping and I have 2 ideas you might like: a) Spring impact with a Magnolia tree underpants with spring flowering bulbs (personally I like the King Alfred daffodils, tulips and grape hyacinth combo) or b) a grouping of 3 clump Birches planted as an island then UPLIT with white spotlights. I did this at one of my old houses and people always complimented it.  Even in winter it is striking. The Birch trees look good underpants with Daffodils and Vinca minor (periwinkle vine) or spring and summer bulbs and Gold Coast juniper which spread."
