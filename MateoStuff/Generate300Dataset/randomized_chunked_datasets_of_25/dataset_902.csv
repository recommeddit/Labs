52083,best iphone case,"Just returned my leather case. Had it for about a week and it was already falling apart. The leather was coming off the edges and it was bubbling on the back. No drops or anything, mostly in my pocket or sitting on my desk at work. Pretty disappointed as it's a great feeling and looking case."
55406,best action and adventure novel series,"Lucifer's Hammer was such a damn blast. I remember my sister's boyfriend letting me read his copy and constantly talking about how great it gets once the comet fell. Took me forever to get there, but holy hell. I read the following 400 pages in about four days, it was just so damn good. And the reliance on Hard Science just makes it that much better. The idea that that could really happen exactly as described makes the whole read so much more astonishing.  
Might very well be one of the most underrated novels of all time. I wish more people would read it."
3100,best webcamera,">Image processing

---

>Not really considering how big of a difference even a selfie camera is over a webcam.

You're basically backing up the point. Selfie cams are usually attached to $1000 phones with extremely powerful cpus that do lots of image processing.

Edit: ""I have a _____ brand phone and it wasn't $1000 it's got a great front facing camera"". Okay, $750 phone, $600 phone, $450 phone. The point is the same. Smh."
34679,best NFL player,"Warner doesn't even belong in the HOF, neverminded in the top 100 layers of all time. Such an over-rated flash in the pan."

23574,best car racing video game,"A guy released a patch for it in 2019 as well, so it'll work on modern systems with that."
7251,best iPhone,"Minus display for me, camera is great not two camera System, but this one is nice, other all is super."
49555,best gaming monitor,What?
55286,best places to hike in the east coast,"I don't know, I'd classify beaches as outdoorsy. Boston in the spring is full of runners and cyclists. NYC and DC are all very oriented on outdoor tourism.

If OP meant things like hiking or off roading, I'd assume he/she wouldn't ask for cities."

71568,best movies with a cool twist,"Agreed. Now it's common knowledge, especially with the prequels out, but originally it was amazing."
26479,best politician,"Turn 'the death of civility' into the new family values in order to appeal to everyone.

Who could possibly argue against turn signal awareness, [the waiter rule](http://i.imgur.com/564sy.png) or staying off that goddamn cell phone when someone is trying to talk to you?

Tell a few apocryphal rude douchebag stories and you can get more votes than those welfare queen tall tales garnered for Reagan back in the '80s."

1912,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Lmao I agree with you. I’m from NJ originally, and there is no real comparison out here. 

Agreed with you on Rusty’s / Giovannis I’ll eat it at work, but it’s not good pizza it’s just decent and good value. 

I personally gave up on pizza and embraced the local stuff here. SB, compared to other places I’ve lived, has an amazing variety of cheap Indian / Asian food, so I’m finding myself eating a lot more Indian food now."

47517,best state to visit in the United States,"Disney World/Orlando area. Went twice in 2018, once for a marching band function (thinking about that makes me almost cry. 6 days in Disney with all my close friends, no worries and just hanging out.) and again with my family a few months afterwards. I had never been to Florida before that, and as a lower middle class Ohioan, going twice within 100 days was phenomenal."
38675,best newspapers to read,The Independant.  Pretty much the only one that doesn't make me want to eat my own face.
32862,best free online grammar checker,"Before diving into book purchases you need to decide two things: what level of grammar help do you need (beginner, intermediate or advanced like a highly educated native speaker) and do you want English grammar or American grammar because they are different.

Once you have decided, have a look at the many internet reviews of grammar books to choose one appropriate to your needs."
