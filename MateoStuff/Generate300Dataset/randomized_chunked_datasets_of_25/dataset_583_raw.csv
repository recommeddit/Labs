That made it much better! Great suggestion. I will include it along with consistent line colours across graphs in the next set.
My dad died some time ago. I try to go fishing on Fathers Day because thats what we liked to do together.
"Male here, but I would like to ask the female redditors, what about Antonio Banderas - The Secret?"
Can you just toggle this? That would be so great for grinding.
"I’m pretty sure  Economics is the most common major at USC. I’d probably guess that HPDP isn’t that common, and replace it with either Human Bio or Political Science from my personal experience. Otherwise I agree with this list"
"Obviously Hansa Rostock.

They had Turboneger as their stadium hymn."
"I prefer the second generation to the first, despite playing the first generation originally."

Everything bagel with cream cheese and lox.
"Thor Ragnarok is a mid-80's sci-fi/fantasy B-movie disguised as a superhero film, I love it so much."
If it's not on the list I don't recommend them.
"Yes, you can go buy one off of any site that sells 11 phone cases."
"Of the individual hero movies, its my favorite in the MCU."
"Anecdote, but my Anker 10000 power bank started swelling significantly one month after the warranty ended.  They didn't replace it or anything, which is understandable given it was technically out of warranty, but that experience didn't leave me with much confidence in the brand."
"One of my college professors gamely told us his I'm-a-doofus airplane seatmate story. This seatmate was having a little mobility trouble and asked for a hand putting away his carry-on, a black hard-sided case. Chit-chat ensued: ""Oh, is that a musical instrument?"" ""Yes."" ""Music's so great. I play a little piano myself. What do you play?"" ""Fiddle.""

Guy didn't seem too chatty, so he kind of let it drop. Kind of had that ""wait a minute, my seatmate looks kind of familiar"" sense but it wasn't until he'd seen him walk off the plane on crutches that he recognized Itzhak Perlman."
"Yes, I always wondered why it came up for me, and apparently it appears for EVERYONE."
"I have an iphone x and using it w google fi.

I will be switching to android soon"
You can.
"Ok, if you wanna be headstrong about it, go for it. All I'm saying is that people DO put whatever is new and shiny as the ""top"" for a bit. I can promise you that there were a lot of ""This is a top-tier MCU movie and it was incredible"" posts when Black Widow came out, that got tons and tons of upvotes and awards. 

Again, I think the movie kicked ass. It was great for the MCU, but look at my other replies to see if people, especially general audiences, would put this over the other great films we got. I could definitely agree on it being top 10, top 5 is just too optimistic for it."
"I'd take that, actually. Goldfish > crappy chocolate."

Scream used to be great but is aging badly. RR however is still as epic as ever!
People forget that the only thing that is required to be a dad is to spawn. Beyond that they're still individuals!
I agree
There are a few coming out such as the Samsung G7 although that is curved.  This years new monitors appear to have been delayed due to the coronavirus.  I’m looking at buying a new monitor too but hoping to get one with enough bells and whistles to not feel outdated in a couple of years.  Right now I’m on a 24 inch 1080P with 144 hz refresh rate.
