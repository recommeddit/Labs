Happened to me while I was down there. Except it struck me while walking around the marina on a hot summer day with no bathroom in sight. Scariest 20 minute butt squeeze shuffle I've ever had. Almost shat myself.
i thought it was pretty mediocre too
TIL fetch is vanilla js... I thought it was a library.
Couldn't agree more. Atlantis found is my favorite... It needs to happen
"I read all of my news online except for Washington City Paper, which I read while I'm out eating lunch on weekends."
5..4...3...2..1! Pump the fuck up!
"The Leftovers,Sons of Anarchy, Six Feet Under, Bron/Broen, Bloodline, Black Sails, Deadwood, Mindhunter, Fargo. Great shows. The plot and the characters are great and well written. Highly recommended."
"Charcoal toothpaste is actually abrasive and can cause abrasion to your teeth, leading to tooth structure loss.

I'm a dental student."
AKG K-240s are a great pair of headphones that won't break the bank.
"Adam Vinitari is the NFL's All Time Leading scorer. 

It would be an insult to not put him on that list."
"I’ve stayed at Royal Pacific, Hard Rock, and Surf Side so I can’t speak for the whole spectrum. I can say Surfside was a beautiful hotel for a value. Bus service was easy and frequent. Really enjoyed my stay there.

I personally prefer the HR or RP for the short walk to City Walk and faster security (usually a walk-up). Both hotels have beautiful scenery and theming as well as great restaurants. At that point it becomes a matter of preference if you prefer a pacific tropical theme or artsy music vibes. RP is usually a little cheaper if that matters."
"I don't know if some subscriptions are different, but I only pay once for the year, and it's $50. It was rough to come up with the first time, but I've got a cool YNAB budget now that lets me put away a dollar a week so when my scrip comes up again, it'll be easy ;)"
"While I like them both, me and my friend have a tradition of getting hammered and beating Super Mario World (no star road) once a year. Kill it in just a few hours at this point. Been at it for 11 years, it's awesome."
"TextNow has introduced Free unlimited text&call on cellular. No data, but it's very useful because it precludes having to be on WiFi or installing VoIP client on another device."
"UK drill music, nothing gets u more hyped than hearing violent rap about stabbing opps in the neck with ur rambo blade"
"I’ve got the new SE and it’s very good. If I was to go back in time though, I’d have liked to have known about Fairphone and taken a gamble on that. Looks like a good phone and more ethical than apple products."
"Yes, it's like the worst representation of a list ever."

"Don't do something you dislike because you think it's a good career path. Work is going to be a major part of your life, so aiming for something that you can't stand doing is a bad idea."
"Putting the song title before the artist... Oof.

That should only be done if you use ""by"", never with a dash."
"Where I live, a good hearty breakfast consists of white rice, miso soup, a peculiarly sweet egg concoction (it's not an omelette, I don't give a shit what the natives say), some pickled vegetables, and a slab of salt-grilled mackerel. If god loves you (let's be fair if god loved you you wouldn't be awake in time for breakfast) you get a big piece of fish, or two pieces of fish. Three pieces of fish.

Or at least, this is the basic menu at a hotel or something. I think most people only eat breakfast if their wife or mother makes it for them.

So yeah, cup of coffee and a cigarette probably.

EDIT: Yes, as many of the comments have noted, this is Japan."
"My favorite panty-dropper? I would have to say my body's natural pheromones. Seriously. Have fun wasting your money and smelling like a douche, though."
My girlfriend wears FCUK for men and it sure is a panty dropper for me. We're doing the long distance thing right now and she gave me bottle to keep around and sniff!
My kids do this. I'm not used to it at all. I spent 12 years catering to every whim and now I hardly see them anymore. They never tell me about their friends. I would wager the op has young kids. What I want is for my kids to spend time with me doing things that I want to do with them.
"I've found Sci-hub less effective these days, but yeah they're still around. Also consider using [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) for searching OA content. Industry people think much of what used to be paywalled will be open access as a standard. Publishers would make money on APC (what the author has to pay to publish) and selling bibliometric data.
