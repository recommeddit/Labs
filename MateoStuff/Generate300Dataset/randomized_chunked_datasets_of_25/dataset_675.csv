46231,best trick or treating candy,"When I lived in a neighborhood with some friends from college, we set out a bowl with a sign that says take 1. 

Being the bored college kids we were, we hid in the bushes and around the porch and scared the shit out of any kids who didn't obey the sign.

One kid actually took the entire bowl and probably shit his pants a few moments later."
38175,best Marvel movie,"That was my first reaction too so I get it and if Endgame didn’t focus on it, I’d totally agree but they make you and the characters sit with it. And this is probably just me but I could see the sliver of possibility that Nakia/Okoye/M’Baku become BP and they make Miles Spider-Man.  Not saying likely, but I could see it. Because frankly I hate that we know all this behind the scenes crap and dont want to hold that against a movie that again, shocked me when it ended!"

39649,best podcast for biologists,"I'm sorry but those guys are completely ignorant, especially when it comes to anything science-related. Really hard to listen to for me because of how wrong they get so many things."
33180,best energy drink,"I drink Rockstar once in a while, but for taste. It doesn't really seem to do anything for me energy-wise."
16517,best sunglasses for fashion,"Everyone has said what I would have said about brands (the comment about having 3 ""types"" of sunnies is solid gold advice) so Imma just speak to the importance of trying them on. 

When it comes to the more expensive purchases ($200.00+) I think having a chance to feel the quality of the frame and seeing how they look on your face is important. Sometimes little details like the width of the arms or like the angle of the nose peice totally change how the glasses feel/look.

Once you've figured out your fave brand/frame ordering online to change up the lense or frame combo is less stressful."
72751,best wireless lightweight mouse,Razer Viper Ultimate is the best money  can buy in terms of wireless mice and tech. It is better than GPW because many GPW are known to develop double click issues. Razer Viper Ultimate will never develop those issues because it uses optical switches for m1 and m2. Plus the coating on the RVU offer better grip than the coating of the GPW.
