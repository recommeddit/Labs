68353,best science fiction novel,"The way the priests tale is told was absolutely perfect, especially as someone with a lot of experience from faith circles."
73449,best battery bank,"For USB charging devices like phones, I just carry one of those cheap little oblong power banks containing an 18650 battery. I cut a notch in its door edge and removed the vendor's stupid glue, so when the battery is flat, you just pop the door with a screwdriver (I bike so I usually have one) or key and swap the battery for a charged one and carry on. Maximum charge for minimum bulk - just make sure you carry the batteries in holders so they can't short."

45640,best gaming system,So many good memories and so many good games on the 360. Hope you enjoy playing!
43434,best ad service for mobile applications,"There are plenty of ad networks out there, offering several different ad formats like:

&nbsp;

1\. Banner ads

2\. Interstitials

3\. Native ads

4\. Video ads

5\. Surveys

6\. Exit ads

7\. Others

&nbsp;

It really depends on the profile of your apps and which mechanisms currently best applies to the concept of your app. When you find which model you want to follow (let's say CPA with rewarded video ads) you need then to find the proper network for your own apps. Each network is stronger in different areas. It is always a good idea to mediate and combine networks to fill gaps in  fill rate, set floors to eCPM and many other options

&nbsp;

You can have a look at AppBrain listing of all ad networks:

&nbsp;

[Android Ad Library Stats](http://www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/ad)

&nbsp;

where you can see the categories and apps using each network and their popularity/adaption in the Android ecosystem.

33453,best electric car,That’s what you call a delay. If a vehicle gets delayed it will no longer come out at its designated time. This isn’t semantics. It’s just making a pointless argument.
65537,best phone service company,"Colorado Springs (USAFA, Peterson, Schriever, Cheyenne Mountain)

It's a mixture of AT&T and Verizon, some get by with T-Mobile, very few if any Sprint.

I personally used AT&T and rarely had calls drop other than 2 very specific spots on the way to Schriever on Hwy 94. Can anyone say Garbage Hill? lol"
65883,best college in california,"Yeah I didn't realize he was an MBA, thought he was an undergrad hence the SAT statement. But yes post grad is much more expensive."
73839,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I was wondering about this. If you have apple care, can you just pay the $50 or whatever to get a new screen if it gets scratched up?"
58186,best cologne,I always associate this smell with shit since my family used this as bathroom air freshener for like 8 years.
66037,best college in california,"It’s a good plan. I distinctly remember walking by the art building on my way to comm and theater every day and being so immensely jealous of the program. I worked so much there wasn’t a way for me to justify an extra art lab time in my day’s schedule and I had to literally walk by the classes outside on the green. Siiiigh. 

I wish you you luck. :)"
70842,best movies with a cool twist,Lol. That movie did not turn out to be about what I thought it would be about...
198,best terminal file manager reddit,Another vote to ranger. I haven't used anything else but I saw screenshots of others and ranger is the one that looked better. I haven't had many complains about it.
46685,best hand santizer brand,"Do you have any Distillers around?  


We have some here in Utah producing Hand Sanitizer and you know its safe, because they make alcoholic beverages."
28316,best breakfast foods,Soft poached egg on top of a nice potato/sweet potato/cheese hash.
11715,best gifts for dad,"Gift cards (the ones like credit cards), because I never know what to get. He combined a couple of them from Father's Day and his birthday one year and got his first smoker, wood for it and some accessories. He did pay some out of pocket, but it helped with the initial outlay. He still uses that smoker too, unless he wants to go grill style rather than cabinet."

64210,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,I would also put rulit on here as it has helped me countless times. It covers all the popular world languages but also lesser-known ones.
41252,best instrument to play,The accordion.
56512,best desktop monitor,"Try to wait for a sale if you're going to buy this monitor, as it goes on sale several times a year and can be had for as little as $350."
41531,best instrument to play,"I'm basing it from music i have heard and piano is nice but the things people do on guitar are so varied and Intriguing. I heard Tommy emanuel play a guitar and make it sound like a digeridoo, it was amazing, you couldn't do that type of thing on a piano. Perhaps a synth would provide more variety."
22824,best celebrity,"Morgan Freeman flies into my work semi-regularly. We handle the fueling for his jet. He is one of the nicest people I've ever met. And yes, his voice actually does make you tired. 

Nolan Ryan was a complete dick, he too flies in every once in awhile. I love the Rangers, but I can't stand him. 

Reba McEntire is one hell of a sweet lady. Still pretty attractive for her age too. 

Bill Clinton brought me and my coworkers steak fajitas from El Paso when he flew in. He's incredibly nice and had a real conversation with me about my job and school and such. He actually listened and asked questions, not normal for someone famous. Best fajitas ever. 

And NASCAR teams fly in all the time. We actually have some flying in tomorrow night for fuel.  Always a hell of a time when they're here. Most of the time they're nice, but there's always a couple assholes."
