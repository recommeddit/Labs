11046,"My fjalraven large rucksack has kept me good for 4 years. Been with me all through college.
It's also my daypack when I go backpacking or camping. It's my backpack for all short hikes too. 
It's my climbing, commuting, and grocery shopping backpack.

Held up well and aged beautifully. $200 is cheap for such durability.
Only thing is when I got hit by a car biking I landed partially on my backpack and it got one small hole and the schlep of the right side came apart a bit. Despite that being a year ago it still holds up fine and stays strong even with lots of weight in it. When I go grocery shopping I might be lugging close to 25lbs home after along day of classes too.",best backpack for college
