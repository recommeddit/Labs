38627,best newspapers to read,"It's a sad day the first time you detect the Daily Mail's views in your mother or father's conversations. They'd always been there, but it's a matter of growing up enough so that you can pick it up. I felt like I lost my childhood, the first time I saw my mum as a 'Daily Mail reader'."

52328,best hiphop album,"I’ll bite. I acknowledge he was the most succesful rapper in the early 00’s. I was excited about the SSLP and the MMLP. Loved his verses on Devil’s Night, but was slightly dissapointed when The Eminem Show came out. Loved the 8 Mile soundtrack.

Nothing after that *really* excited me. The technical ability is there but I think he has a bad taste in beats and hooks. Great rapper who makes music that sounds bad to me. And making good music is an important factor to me to be a good rapper. Which is why he stays out of the top 5 to me."

46234,best trick or treating candy,Yikes that is kind of gross. Though as a kid I probably would've eaten that candy if my mom wasn't looking. Great tip thanks! I should probably shave and actually put on a clean shirt so I don't scare the parents.
