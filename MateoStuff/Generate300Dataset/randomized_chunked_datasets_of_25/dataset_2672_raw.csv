Thank you for pointing that out. Not sure how I missed it when it was right there in the comments.

"I recently bought G.Bellini Homme Paris from Lidl for €4.99. The bottle is very similar to Dior Sauvage and I read on some forums that the perfume is infact a cheap dupe of Dior Sauvage. I have only smelled Dior Sauvage once when I gifted a bottle to my brother but I really like the smell and performance of the Lidl fragrance.

 I've been meaning to ask this in the Newbie tread but has anyone tried the other Lidl fragrances and can give a recommendation for a Summer fragrance in their line. I saw another fragrance which looked to be a dupe of Bleu de Chanel."

Firefly Vodka.  Try it with Lemonade.
How about KeePass? Idk which is better?
But the chops man!
Pretty sure in the US you have to be 18 as of a few years ago. No way around it
I bet I can tell you what street you got 'em on too.
melon and strawberry
"I have ZeroWater, and the big blue dispenser tank too. I think the filters last fairly long, wish they would last longer. Only big gripe I have with the filters is they take FOREVER for the water to filter through and fill up the container. Other than that, makes water taste really good and gets the tap water taste out of it completely."

"The monitor you linked to doesn't say it has an IPS screen. This page from [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/GGCwrH/asus-monitor-vs238hp) says the monitor is not an IPS monitor. I bought an ASUS VN247H-P 24-inch LED monitor 2 years ago with almost the same specs, but returned it for another monitor (with an IPS screen) because some text was too fuzzy to read on some web sites.

Here's a comparison between [the IPS version and the regular LED version](https://versus.com/en/asus-vs238h-p-vs-asus-vs239h-p), note the product coeds."

I have a 30 ml bottle that I’m using as slowly as possible :(
Fury Road and Seven Samurai if that counts
"Also, no disrespect to the man, but I personally feel that all of Indy 4’s problems can be attributed to Lucas. Spielberg’s biggest mistake was not reeling back some of the more outlandish ideas as you can tell from some of the behind the scenes footage. I think Indy 5 has a real chance to be good."
"And to an extent, I understand why she drops friends sometimes. Like it makes sense to me because being being the youngest of the family and watching all your siblings get screwed over and taken advantage of, she's probably very guarded and cautious. I think this is also why she's so mysterious... she's watched her family get into scandal after scandal - I'm sure she's scared."
Indian Head is correct!
