3362,"I use a dummy battery in the DSLR for the constant power. It's not a turn off problem, it's seems to be the mirror flipping closed or something like that. 

There's a couple of other reasons I switched to a webcam. I don't have a single set up, but instead go between two different buildings so it's a lot easier to pack up and move a webcam instead of a dslr/capture card/tripod and associated wires. Also limited space in the set up means I can't get the DSLR far enough back to have as wide shot as I would like.",best webcamera

33271,"The crazy thing is the Model Y could probably do my pulling for me but by the time I price it out with the towing kit it's almost 20k more than the Lightning (once you consider tax benefits as well). With tax credits, the Lightning could be as low as $35k or so, give or take, while I just priced out the Model Y I would need and was in spitting distance of $60k. Only benefit is I'd be able to walk away with a Model Y sooner.

39403,"Firefox, by far. Better customization, better privacy, lower resource overhead than Chrome, and personally I would argue better looks.

There are a few features Chrome has that I wish Firefox had (better smoothscrolling, smoother drag-and-drop tab support, better Windows high-contrast support), but overall the pros of Firefox outweigh the cons for me.",best web browser

I can laminate how good Terra Mystica is, but if it's not a game you'd get played, it isn't a good recommendation. 

I can suggest Hanabi for a good value, but if you or the people you play with don't like the limitations on communication, it isn't a good value

If possible, I'd recommend visiting a local game store, and trying out games in their demo section. Figure out what you like, and what you think can hit the table.",best board games
