31134,best country to live in,"I can second this. Especially proximity to nature, great work-life balance and a thriving tech sector. All Nordic countries would check the boxes on the list but the tech sector is Stockholm's USP compared to the others."
72329,best keyboard switches,"Just bought a board with KBD fans T1s off /mm and I really am enjoying them. I've usually been one for clicky switches (I have a model m I used exclusively for years) but I am beginning to understand why people like these holy panda esque switches. 

They take enough force to be noticably tactile (makes my roomies browns feel linear), but are still kinda round and smooth feeling which makes typing pleasant. Also they are factory lubes so that's a +"
17478,best iOS game,Also one of my favs. It has been one of the best gacha  games in term of mechanics/depth for a really long time.
46138,best trick or treating candy,"Dude, I would fight for tootsie rolls, smarties, or dubble bubble. Bit -o- honey wasn't all that bad, either."
64888,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,It ~~is~~ ain't the best!
29899,best money managing app,Digit should be in this list as well.
8295,best toothpaste,Didn't charge you? That's a foreign concept.
45638,best gaming system,Welcome brother! May many noobs and monsters be slain.
55735,best action and adventure novel series,"Yes, I would definitely say it is more of a quest adventure and is minimal on the politics and military battles."
68459,best science fiction novel,"I would put Connie Willis on that list (*Doomsday Book*, or *To Say Nothing of the Dog*). Richard Matheson too. And, perhaps I am biased b/c PKD is my favorite Sci-fi author, maybe a little something other than *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep*. I personally think *Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said* was perhaps his best."
30628,best Mexican war to study,"You're very very wrong on Afghanistan: the Taliban offered to turn bin Laden over if they were given evidence of his guilt. Bush refused.

53795,best medicine for a cold,"I do a similar thing. When I'm sick I put even more effort into getting dressed and doing my make up. It's just a mental thing, but looking sick makes me feel sick. Added bonus is not having everyone constantly ask if you're sick."
69344,best major to study in college,"I started out architecture and ended up adding civil engineering on as a second major. (I would have switched outright but I was more than halfway through and had saved my free electives for the end, so the difference between changing majors and double majoring was only one semester. That seemed worth it to have extra options for jobs upon graduating.) 

If I could go back, I probably would have started as an engineering major with my field undeclared or possibly either CS or finance. However, I probably wouldn't have ended up at the same school if I had stated off as a different major, and then I wouldn't have met my husband and a lot of things about my life now would be very different."
63809,best books for building better habits reddit,"Some time ago I had some dental health issues and since i didnt want to go through it again, once it was over i decided i wanted to improve my dental hygiene habits, which were terrible (as well as the rest of my habits). The fear from having dental issues again kept me on track and one day I realised that i subsconciously felt uncomfortable whenever i didnt despite not actively remembering my goal of improving dentl health. I figured i would try to do the same with exercise and general hygiene, but i failed miserably :) i will definitely give it another try thanks to your post, for the moment i will stick to the 8 hour sleep and the 20 minute exercise. Currently i either sleep 5 hours or 12 and exercise none. I'll get back at you with the results :D"
14732,best romantic novel,How come nobody has mentioned Lolita yet. . .
20650,best workout music,Pulse of the Maggots - Slipknot
66918,best soccer team in the world,"Well. The point is that they are arguably a way better side, which would make them deserve to win. Which would make it unfortunate for them to loose.

But on the other hand it is indeed true that they did not show it at the most important moment.
And yeah of course it is true that it is not unfortunite for a german.

Edit: better sentence."
70670,best movies with a cool twist,"I watched Fight Club and Donnie Darko on the same night, both for the first time. I think I stayed up all night reading theories/plot explanations"
12762,best gifts for mom,">Also yes, my little brother did indeed shout ""Combo Breaker"" at the birth of the first daughter.

Awwwwwww."
34163,best NFL player,He did take a couple of teams to the Super Bowl that had no business being there.
25819,best cricket teams of all time,"I remember seeing in a documentary on YouTube and from people who followed them during those days like my dad that the Windies were by far the best fielding side and were tremendously fit  athletes. Similar to what u said about the Aussies before,, many people think the Windies were a bunch of  talented people who somehow magically came together under magnificent captains. The fact is they trained very very hard on their fitness and had strict rules on vices all of which tended to a bit slack in other teams back in the day. They also studied other teams and discussed each and every weakness of opposing teams nothing was left to chance....I mean apparently Viv Richards spent hours studying the bowling of lilee and Imran khan and Indian spinners in order to catch that weakness...I guess those are the stuff which tend be forgotten when it comes to great teams or great players ...they were all talented. But the fact this they were great cos they worked way harder than others to get there"

30753,best country to live in,"Still to be seen: Swedes being nice to Danes. It seems like r/swarje is the only swedish subreddit to comment about Danes. Multiple posts on front page makes jokes about the Danish language. Most of them are by swedes. 

When I was on Jodel in Lund for Valborg, I wrote something like ""Hi, Copenhagener here visiting some friends in Lund, so excited to visit you for Valborg"". All I got back was ""run back home to your own country"", ""Dansk Jävel!"" and ""you can leave now"". 

My impression of Sweden before: Calm people, who doesn't like to make conclusions too quickly, *very* politically correct, great at making music, a little bit arrogant humour, but alright if you know that it's just humour, Midsummer, Pippi Langstrømpe...

Now: ""Fuck Danes"""
