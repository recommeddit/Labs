They take enough force to be noticably tactile (makes my roomies browns feel linear), but are still kinda round and smooth feeling which makes typing pleasant. Also they are factory lubes so that's a +",best keyboard switches

69344,"I started out architecture and ended up adding civil engineering on as a second major. (I would have switched outright but I was more than halfway through and had saved my free electives for the end, so the difference between changing majors and double majoring was only one semester. That seemed worth it to have extra options for jobs upon graduating.) 

If I could go back, I probably would have started as an engineering major with my field undeclared or possibly either CS or finance. However, I probably wouldn't have ended up at the same school if I had stated off as a different major, and then I wouldn't have met my husband and a lot of things about my life now would be very different.",best major to study in college
63809,"Some time ago I had some dental health issues and since i didnt want to go through it again, once it was over i decided i wanted to improve my dental hygiene habits, which were terrible (as well as the rest of my habits). The fear from having dental issues again kept me on track and one day I realised that i subsconciously felt uncomfortable whenever i didnt despite not actively remembering my goal of improving dentl health. I figured i would try to do the same with exercise and general hygiene, but i failed miserably :) i will definitely give it another try thanks to your post, for the moment i will stick to the 8 hour sleep and the 20 minute exercise. Currently i either sleep 5 hours or 12 and exercise none. I'll get back at you with the results :D",best books for building better habits reddit

25819,"I remember seeing in a documentary on YouTube and from people who followed them during those days like my dad that the Windies were by far the best fielding side and were tremendously fit  athletes. Similar to what u said about the Aussies before,, many people think the Windies were a bunch of  talented people who somehow magically came together under magnificent captains. The fact is they trained very very hard on their fitness and had strict rules on vices all of which tended to a bit slack in other teams back in the day. They also studied other teams and discussed each and every weakness of opposing teams nothing was left to chance....I mean apparently Viv Richards spent hours studying the bowling of lilee and Imran khan and Indian spinners in order to catch that weakness...I guess those are the stuff which tend be forgotten when it comes to great teams or great players ...they were all talented. But the fact this they were great cos they worked way harder than others to get there",best cricket teams of all time

30753,"Still to be seen: Swedes being nice to Danes. It seems like r/swarje is the only swedish subreddit to comment about Danes. Multiple posts on front page makes jokes about the Danish language. Most of them are by swedes. 

When I was on Jodel in Lund for Valborg, I wrote something like ""Hi, Copenhagener here visiting some friends in Lund, so excited to visit you for Valborg"". All I got back was ""run back home to your own country"", ""Dansk Jävel!"" and ""you can leave now"". 

My impression of Sweden before: Calm people, who doesn't like to make conclusions too quickly, *very* politically correct, great at making music, a little bit arrogant humour, but alright if you know that it's just humour, Midsummer, Pippi Langstrømpe...
