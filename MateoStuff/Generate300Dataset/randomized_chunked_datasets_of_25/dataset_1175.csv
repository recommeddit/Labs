43519,best items under $100,"Never be ashame of a price for something you spent a third of your life in/on. 

A good mattress/pillow can change everything. Hell everything related to sleep is very important and worth investing into."
26566,best board games,"I am new, and just getting into the boardgame / tabletop world. I was wondering which of these games have the most replay value? Since I currently have somewhat limited funds I'd like to get a couple games that will last me longer than a few hours. Obviously this is very different, but Cards Against Humanity is an example of a fun game, that becomes dull after a couple hours of playtime. Any suggestions if I am only purchasing maybe one or two board games a month to build a nice collection? Thanks. Currently I play games like Munchkin, Settlers of Catan and Secret Hitler. Thanks!"
52506,best hiphop album,Lol this reminds me of one of those troll comments on  the CDTV Productions Youtube
68508,best science fiction novel,The ending of Hyperion is perfection?
18962,best YouTube video,"‚ÄúTarare, look at me.. did you eat a fucking baby?‚Äù"
46693,best hand santizer brand,"I live in a particular Chicago burb and our supplies are rarely ever sold out, no one is wearing masks either. As soon as they are 5ft into the store they pull down their mask so I feel like supplies near me aren't as rare because most of them don't really care."
64378,best place to pirate mac apps reddit,For a good couple of years I have used their releases. Their track record holds and is safe.
26572,best board games,Everyone loves Codenames but you have to have a nominally competent set of players and a large party to make it worthwhile.
3286,best webcamera,That's been my biggest regret. I spent a little bit of money on a lot of stuff and it added up. Now I have a graveyard in my attic where all my old stream gear is buried. Pro-tip if you're going to buy a green screen get twice the size you think you'll need.
6904,best iPhone,I loved the 5c and never had any issues with it. I‚Äôd stick longer with it but my model was only 16gb at the time.
43119,best detective show,"* Endeavour

23571,best car racing video game,"NFS Shift was also pretty good for this, you could not access the higher car classes before completed the previous ones"
65451,best phone service company,"A YouTube commenter pointed this out too! I honestly forgot about the plan while making the video. I may have also been hesitant to add it if it was a more limited-time promo. 

For now it is still sticking around, and I should have mentioned it! I'll definitely be sure to mention it in my dedicated ""best unlimited plans"" video.

You can find the plan in the comparison chart üëçüèª"
62641,Best RPG game on PS4,"No suggestions, just a heartfelt statement that dark souls 2 is great."
24801,best anime,"In no particular order:

Dragon ball (all three)
 
Bleach
 
HxH
 
A Certain Magical Index
 
AoT
 
Birdy the Mighty
 
Shakugan no Shana
 
Katanagatari
 
Shigerui
 
Black Rock Shooter
 

 
I obviously highly recommend every one of them but Black Rock Shooter and Shigerui stand out as being the most original and having the best animation, art and fluidity for me."
61271,Best RPG game on PS4,The story structure gets extremely weird. There‚Äôs multiple endings but it‚Äôll never feel like you‚Äôre replaying the same part. It still feels fairly linear as you get through the multiple endings.
34424,best NFL player,"There is no single great because of 2 reasons 

1: People opinions 

2: You can't compare positions to other (can't compare rb to safety"
57827,best cologne,"Department stores like Macy's, Kohl's or a fragrance store in a mall."
24220,best anime,Agreed. Clannad isn't a contender for top anime unless you include season 2. Season 1 is very average.
43637,best items under $100,"A rice cooker. My mom always said that having one use appliances is a waste of money and space, and as an adult now I generally agree. No quesadilla makers, donut/cake pop machines, etc. I spent almost ten years of my adult life boiling rice on the stove and often times messing it up. It should be simple but for me it just isn‚Äôt. I bought a rice cooker on sale and OH MAN. Life changed. It‚Äôs even got a steamer basket so it‚Äôs not even technically a one use appliance. Perfect rice every time, and you can set it and forget it until it‚Äôs time to eat. Frees up a stove burner, and meals where I cook rice now feel a lot easier. I‚Äôm willing to die on this hill."
