26566,"I am new, and just getting into the boardgame / tabletop world. I was wondering which of these games have the most replay value? Since I currently have somewhat limited funds I'd like to get a couple games that will last me longer than a few hours. Obviously this is very different, but Cards Against Humanity is an example of a fun game, that becomes dull after a couple hours of playtime. Any suggestions if I am only purchasing maybe one or two board games a month to build a nice collection? Thanks. Currently I play games like Munchkin, Settlers of Catan and Secret Hitler. Thanks!",best board games

43637,"A rice cooker. My mom always said that having one use appliances is a waste of money and space, and as an adult now I generally agree. No quesadilla makers, donut/cake pop machines, etc. I spent almost ten years of my adult life boiling rice on the stove and often times messing it up. It should be simple but for me it just isn‚Äôt. I bought a rice cooker on sale and OH MAN. Life changed. It‚Äôs even got a steamer basket so it‚Äôs not even technically a one use appliance. Perfect rice every time, and you can set it and forget it until it‚Äôs time to eat. Frees up a stove burner, and meals where I cook rice now feel a lot easier.
