72365,best keyboard switches,"Browns, tbh"
30532,best Mexican war to study,"There is certainly a large school of thought that argues that Polk essentially engineered the war to acquire California. There is another school( that I think has declined) that argues was was inevitable when the  United States annexed Texas. I tend to be more sympathetic towards Polk, but there are historians who would disagree with me."
30508,best Mexican war to study,"Except Mexico did not recognize Texas independence, so it still saw itself as putting down a rebellion. After U.S. annexation it was actually Mexico that was invaded when American troops examples on the Rio Grande, since the Nueces River was the actual border."
21349,best workout music,[Down With The Sickness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeBJBiVFX1U) by Disturbed. Without the mommy part in case child abuse doesn't pump you up.
6389,best Netflix documentary,"Never heard of it. Thanks for the recommendation!

If you like war documentaries I highly recommend they shall not grow old."
27120,best board games,"The art is just fine to me too. I feel like they spent all their budget on the gold/silver/bronze tokens, and forgot to spend anything on the rest of the pieces though.

The player mats are awful (god help you if someone ever bumps the board), and I really wish the things that go out on the map itself were more tactile. Just a bit of verticality could make it go a long way toward really feeling like you were terraforming -- especially with cities."
43204,best detective show,The Fall (Gillian Anderson)
11454,best gifts for dad,"More socks and underwear, I've almost made it through last years supply!"
16275,best sunglasses for fashion,"Clubmasters are cool and all, but have you seen [Maui Jim Kawikas](https://www.mauijim.com/shop/sunglasses/classic/kawika)? They combine that classic frame-less bottom look with a sexy squareness and the quality is insane. I was lucky enough to happen across a pair right as I was about to pick up some Clubmasters, and I am so happy I randomly found them! If anyone is in the market I highly recommend checking out a pair."
20016,best workout music,"[Edwin Starr - War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoRxD1oBWTU&feature=related)  for me, love it when that comes up in the gym"
8745,best toothpaste,"Using a vented mouth guard? I have the same habits biotene with the mouth guard/dental appliances when I was using them made a huge difference.

Plus like things like brushing your tongue and stuff that my dentist here recommended."
61276,Best RPG game on PS4,Yep this is an amazing game. Combat mechanics isn't soulsborne but holds up amazingly.
10100,best pencil for drawing,"The ""button"" of that Staedtler is a sharpener."
15114,best tree for the garden,"1. What kind of trees should I buy?
** You‚Äôre in OH. If you need year round blockage, then go conifer route instead of deciduous. 

2. Who should I order them from?
**Depends on your area. Size you pick. Delivery.**

3. When should I plant them?
**This should be #2. Whenever available and able to work the ground.**

4. How much space should I put in between each tree?

**Depends:**

‚Ä¢ how instantaneous you want the privacy. 

‚Ä¢ your budget.

5. How many trees should I get to grow a 40' long wall?
**See above. Budget and expectations will drive this.**

6. What size and price for each tree is a good deal?
**Depends on your local conditions; if you can work a deal with volume/wholesaler; size; delivery, etc.**


Basically‚Äîyou can do anything you want, but it comes down to your budget. 

**If you buy larger,** you‚Äôll need a crew and/or equipment to move say a 12‚Äô tree with a B&B rootball. You‚Äôll have your privacy faster. 

**If you buy smaller/ not a burlap root ball,** you can move and plant relatively easily, could buy more and have a denser hedge-like effect. But, the trees are smaller and will take years to grow to desired height.


**instead of trees** you could also go the privet hedge route. Fast. Cheap. Bamboo if you hate your neighbors and if allowed in your community.

EDIT: cleaned up crappy formatting on my part."
28628,best breakfast foods,That's the thing I miss the most from France.  Fresh baguette from the bakery every morning.  I'd wake up early and I'd be fucking excited for breakfast.
8079,best toothpaste,"Also really valuable for those with poor motor control, ie parkinsons or arthritis"
11721,best gifts for dad,"For about six years (since my grandparents got married), my brother and I have given him a flashlight each holiday. I have no clue how it started or even why, but we've kept it going. He has a huge shelf above their fireplace that he custom-built for all of them and he brags about them every chance he gets. It's adorable, honestly."
54357,best medicine for a cold,"Nothing works at beating a cold as this: Pour 1 capful from a large bottle of Crest Pro Health mouthwash into the reservoir of a WaterPik and fill it up the rest of the way with the hottest water from your tap. It has to be Crest Pro Health. Other mouthwashes foam too much.

Use the large WaterPik fitting and set the WaterPik at setting 4. Now begin to spray the inside of your mouth deep to your tonsils, under your tongue, and especially the roof of your mouth deep to your throat. Get under your tongue, the space next to your teeth and every where you can reach.

At first nothing much happens. The water/mouthwash solution pretty much is clear. Then as you continue to hit the adenoids and the roof of your mouth way back, small hard white pockets of mucus will be dislodged. This will start to release a huge amount of white mucus from your sinuses and throat and mouth. It will continue and you won't believe how much is released from yourself. Fill the reservoir again and it will continue. The little hard white plugs will diminish and the large globs will continue. Usually two reservoir will clean you out just right. When you finish you will blow your nose and breathe as if you don't have a cold or flu at all. Go to bed and breathe normally without any medication. Next morning do it again and breathe normally all day. Except for being a little run down from your cold you will feel almost normal.

If you snore this will fix it also. Also, if you have a sore throat a tiny amount of blood may be mixed in the mucus but this is from the infected tissue that you cleaned out. Your sore throat will be healed in a day or two and you will feel immediately better.

I had people tell me when they re sick that they may have to take a week off. I tell them about this and they show up for work the next day looking fine. What have I discovered here."
25137,best spiderman actor,HEEEEELLLL No.  Chum bucket for me then.
31483,best hotel to live in,"Don't remember the name of it since it was a long time ago but it was in the heart of Washington D.C. and I payed $80 dollars a night for a week. Spent most of my time around the city and not in the room but for a price like that in the middle of D.C. all you can ask for is a functioning bed, instead I got a stupid comfy bed, cable, wifi, and maybe 3 blocks from the Smithsonian."
72168,best movies with a cool twist,"There is absolutely no way to avoid spoilers here. If you read the thread, you'll spoil any movie listed that you haven't seen."

68039,best science fiction novel,"for us old people, all these old books were very ahead of their time. In the case of Androids it dealt with people's fears of computers at the dawn of the computer age when no one had a computer"
14798,best romantic novel,"Ahaha no problem! I got all excited because I thought there was another LK book out there that I didn‚Äôt know about.
