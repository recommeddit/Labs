The player mats are awful (god help you if someone ever bumps the board), and I really wish the things that go out on the map itself were more tactile. Just a bit of verticality could make it go a long way toward really feeling like you were terraforming -- especially with cities.",best board games

15114,"1. What kind of trees should I buy?
** You‚Äôre in OH. If you need year round blockage, then go conifer route instead of deciduous. 

2. Who should I order them from?
**Depends on your area. Size you pick. Delivery.**

3. When should I plant them?
**This should be #2. Whenever available and able to work the ground.**

4. How much space should I put in between each tree?

**Depends:**

‚Ä¢ how instantaneous you want the privacy. 

‚Ä¢ your budget.

5. How many trees should I get to grow a 40' long wall?
**See above. Budget and expectations will drive this.**

6. What size and price for each tree is a good deal?
**Depends on your local conditions; if you can work a deal with volume/wholesaler; size; delivery, etc.**


Basically‚Äîyou can do anything you want, but it comes down to your budget. 

**If you buy larger,** you‚Äôll need a crew and/or equipment to move say a 12‚Äô tree with a B&B rootball. You‚Äôll have your privacy faster. 

**If you buy smaller/ not a burlap root ball,** you can move and plant relatively easily, could buy more and have a denser hedge-like effect. But, the trees are smaller and will take years to grow to desired height.


**instead of trees** you could also go the privet hedge route. Fast. Cheap. Bamboo if you hate your neighbors and if allowed in your community.

54357,"Nothing works at beating a cold as this: Pour 1 capful from a large bottle of Crest Pro Health mouthwash into the reservoir of a WaterPik and fill it up the rest of the way with the hottest water from your tap. It has to be Crest Pro Health. Other mouthwashes foam too much.

Use the large WaterPik fitting and set the WaterPik at setting 4. Now begin to spray the inside of your mouth deep to your tonsils, under your tongue, and especially the roof of your mouth deep to your throat. Get under your tongue, the space next to your teeth and every where you can reach.

At first nothing much happens. The water/mouthwash solution pretty much is clear. Then as you continue to hit the adenoids and the roof of your mouth way back, small hard white pockets of mucus will be dislodged. This will start to release a huge amount of white mucus from your sinuses and throat and mouth. It will continue and you won't believe how much is released from yourself. Fill the reservoir again and it will continue. The little hard white plugs will diminish and the large globs will continue. Usually two reservoir will clean you out just right. When you finish you will blow your nose and breathe as if you don't have a cold or flu at all. Go to bed and breathe normally without any medication. Next morning do it again and breathe normally all day. Except for being a little run down from your cold you will feel almost normal.

If you snore this will fix it also. Also, if you have a sore throat a tiny amount of blood may be mixed in the mucus but this is from the infected tissue that you cleaned out. Your sore throat will be healed in a day or two and you will feel immediately better.

I had people tell me when they re sick that they may have to take a week off. I tell them about this and they show up for work the next day looking fine. What have I discovered here.",best medicine for a cold
