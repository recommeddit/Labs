39319,"Quite frankly while I mostly agree with you, I don't think it's at all fair to compare the privacy implications of Windows vs. Chrome as equivalent. Windows does collect Telemetry data, but it's anonymized telemetry data that is explicitly not allowed to be used for advertising purposes and is just used by developers so that they know why their app is crashing or not running properly.

On the other hand Chrome's data harvesting is explicitly for advertising purposes, to build up profiled information on you that will be sold to the highest bidder. And that's not to mention that because Google fundamentally makes it's money from advertisers (whereas Microsoft makes it from selling businesses software and services), Google's incentives in the development of Chrome's feature set are much more perverse and insiduous (just look at them blocking ad-blockers).

Fundamentally, at the core of Microsoft's business (i.e. where all their revenue comes from) is securing other businesses data. At the core of Google's business is selling your data to advertisers.

If you can get away with running Linux as your daily driver that's awesome and I do think that's the ideal. But I don't think Windows and Chrome are remotely comparable from a privacy standpoint, and I would still wholeheartedly endorse someone who wants to use Windows, but not so for Chrome.",best web browser
