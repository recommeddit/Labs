Itâ€™s pretty heavy, and I havenâ€™t had a chance to use it (I got it during a Black Friday sale and am not traveling cuz of covid). I do have high hopes, whenever I travel to cold places my phone used to die after 2 hours."

Or, cus I'm still a cheap bastard, or might not know how much I'll use it. Buy a cheap one, and it will either do just fine, or when it breaks or gets thrown off a roof in frustration, you know the good one is worth it,  and what features to look for."

7769,best laptop for general use,"Best as in all purpose laptop, light gaming, productivity, web browsing, good keyboard, trackpad, etc. For example I thought the Lenovo Slim 9i was perfect as it had the Intel Evo badge, slim, beautiful design, wifi 6, thunderbolt 4, etc. But turns out it performs horribly as the slim design doesn't allow for proper cooling and throttles the i7 chip hard. 

From the research I've done so far the razor book 13 seems to be the best but I don't think the value is there at $2000."
31895,best hotel to live in,Thanks for the info and recommendation. Looking at off-season is a fantastic idea for finding a deal. I have a ton of incoming work so what I want is precisely a boring routine minus any household chores.
21016,best workout music,"The fuck, why is my comment this way?"
39319,best web browser,"Quite frankly while I mostly agree with you, I don't think it's at all fair to compare the privacy implications of Windows vs. Chrome as equivalent. Windows does collect Telemetry data, but it's anonymized telemetry data that is explicitly not allowed to be used for advertising purposes and is just used by developers so that they know why their app is crashing or not running properly.

On the other hand Chrome's data harvesting is explicitly for advertising purposes, to build up profiled information on you that will be sold to the highest bidder. And that's not to mention that because Google fundamentally makes it's money from advertisers (whereas Microsoft makes it from selling businesses software and services), Google's incentives in the development of Chrome's feature set are much more perverse and insiduous (just look at them blocking ad-blockers).

Fundamentally, at the core of Microsoft's business (i.e. where all their revenue comes from) is securing other businesses data. At the core of Google's business is selling your data to advertisers.

If you can get away with running Linux as your daily driver that's awesome and I do think that's the ideal. But I don't think Windows and Chrome are remotely comparable from a privacy standpoint, and I would still wholeheartedly endorse someone who wants to use Windows, but not so for Chrome."
14772,best romantic novel,Yes! Iâ€™m loving her writing style. She really fleshes out her characters. In the middle of The Highwayman (because of this sub) and itâ€™s just so detailed and angsty and emotionally descriptive!!!! :D
