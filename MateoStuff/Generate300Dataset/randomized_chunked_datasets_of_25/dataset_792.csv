68537,best science fiction novel,"I don't think the writing is strong enough for it to qualify for something like that (but then again, people handed The Wheel of Time awards for no real reason). 

I *do* think the show will wind up somewhere between BSG and Farscape, however. The acting in the show at times is a little like the writing, but it's strengthened by some strong moments (spinning the drum, the riot on Eros, the full turn in the first episode, some others in season 3 I wouldn't want to spoil here)."

31109,best country to live in,"My bachelors was in social sciences also. I'd need to pick up an entirely different degree (maybe a 1-year Masters) to do UX, and starting from scratch on experience there. I'm actually on a job roster for the UN right now where it's estimated about 90% of us will be offered jobs, btw, so the International Affairs degree would not necessarily be totally worthless. But it probably wouldn't offer as much flexibility as I'd ideally like to have."
