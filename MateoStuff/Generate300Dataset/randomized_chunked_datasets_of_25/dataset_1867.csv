Corner stores, not so much, though, certainly not in the way, say, Paris does. American cities tend to be much more forcefully divided between residential and commercial than European cities.",best country to live in

12113,"I'm female, but this is me. I have a pile of nice scarves and jewelry-- some of it expensive-- just sitting in a dresser drawer, because it's not really my taste. People always say ""let me know if you don't like it"" but when my aunt hands me the fancy bracelet she bought on her trip to Italy I'm not gonna be like ""yo, fuck this!""

Good luck to you!  My suggestion would be to network with classmates/professors at Kaplan, see what they can do for you in your area in terms of getting real work experience or job placement.
