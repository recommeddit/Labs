29619,best game console,"Upvoted for compiling such great list! Glorious!

Growing up, I spend lots of my time on my PS, PS2, Xbox360 and PS3. Well not anymore due to the Glorious GabeN decided to cut the price of most of the PC game. 

Circlejerk aside, I played some of those games you've listed and it was awesome. Appreciate your effort for compiling."

59837,best perfume,I don't really like perfume. I like body spray. Bath and Body Works fall scents are probably my favorite. Wild Madagascar Vanilla and Twilight Woods are good too
17462,best iOS game,real racing 3
58108,best cologne,"Chrome is a little golden nugget, pretty good and not too expensive.

Little pro tip though. If you're tired of spending so much on aqua di gio, check out 360 degree red by perry ellis. It's a very similar scent (often called a clone) and I think a 6.4oz bottle set me back like 40 bucks."
5460,best home improvement store,Thank you home improvement guru.
42757,best detective show,Ozark was great.
565,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"Off the top of my head - Adobe Digital Editions, OneNote and Evernote can do this.  
  
All three open PDF & ePub, have syncing and support annotations."
22525,best celebrity,"I personally liked Keanu Reeves' [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2j4ce1/keanu_reeves_hello/), especially with all the ""uhmms"" and how he replies to his own comments."
52359,best hiphop album,"I enjoy every album on that list but come on. It’s complete trash. Like somebody mentioned before, if that was your own personal top 10 list then cool , great list, music is about what you love and how it makes you feel. But when making an all time list ? Nope . Complete bullshit . Any top 10 list has to include these albums in my opinion ;

Illmatic,
Ready to die ,
Me against the world,
All eyes on me ,
ATLiens ,
Low end theory ,
Reasonable doubt ,
The score ,
It takes a nation ,
Only built 4 Cuban linx,"
7019,best iPhone,"The chin is the same size as the iPhone 11's, but the side bezels are a fraction of the width, even slimmer than the Pro's."
11961,best gifts for dad,That makes so much sense now. I've seen Canadians post previously about being confused in reference to In-N-Out double-doubles. I've always wondered what coffee had to do with burgers!
3556,best college for research,"[http://commondatasets.com/](http://commondatasets.com/)

Note: only good for T30s and nothing about vibes or student life, just what you can find in the common data set"
25811,best cricket teams of all time,"I have been going to test  cricket for a long long time (since the 70’s) and believe me that 80’s windies  team was the most intimidating of the lot. Not statistically but they had more presence than any team I have ever seen in any sport. Had it won before the toss when you see any 4 of the following on the team sheet garner Marshall, holding, Walsh Roberts and Ambrose. Oh and The professorial looking Clive Lloyd and the sheer swagger of Viv. 
Mind you Jeff Thomson was the single craziest thing I have seen. 
Richard Hadley the cleverest
Curtly the meanest
Malcolm Marshall the best."
48296,best color to paint with,What part of the internet am I on again?
8084,best toothpaste,"I always thought using an electric toothbrush makes it easier to maintain ""good form"" while brushing."
30950,best country to live in,"Winters can be pretty brutal and if you don't like hockey you'd better learn to. Besides that, it's a pretty great country. Specifically Ontario, that may be biased though."
71812,best movies with a cool twist,"Honestly, Spider Man Hoemcoming’s plot twist got me pretty good. 

Lol @ everyone downvoting me cuz I mentioned a superhero movie."
43348,best ad service for mobile applications,"I am using admob along with Facebook Audience Network.

Works Fine"
43867,best items under $100,"Chromecast Beta lets you cast your entire screen to the TV, letting you cast essentially anything. My dad streams amazon instant from his PC laptop over chromecast and has no issues."
16589,best pet for toddlers,"As I replied to another answer, I had bunnies growing up. That was the reason for my suggestion. 

Ferrets may not be the best, but my friend has one and is completely gaga over him, he doesn't  bite."
52486,best hiphop album,"I'm gonna get hate, but Kristoff Krane's Kairos is so damn unique I'd find it hard not to be in my top 5.  Same with Kill The Vulture with Carnelian, as a fan of jazzy hiphop that's so damn good. 

Nas Illmatic is probably the choice that wins out but I think I prefer It Was Written.  But both are damn good."
66929,best soccer team in the world,So which team do you suggest for their spot?
35769,best alcoholic drink,"Make a rule and tell your friends. Every two drinks (shots, mixed, beer) MUST be followed by a glass of water.

Have your more sober friends keep you to it even when you “don’t need it”.  Your asshole friends will be the ones trying to get you blackout drunk but the best nights of drinking, IMHO, are the ones where you get 70%blitzed and remember everything.

Happy 21st."
