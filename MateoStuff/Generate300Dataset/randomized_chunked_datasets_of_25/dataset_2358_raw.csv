"JK Rowling was *nobody* before her first book took off, and the only reason it took off is because *people (of all ages) loved reading it*. That's about as far away from the concept of ""famous for being famous"" as you can get.

Of course, everything that's popular will attract additional attention because of its popularity. That's what popularity *is*."

The twist is very shocking though.
"Wisconsin:
The Dells (near Wisconsin Dells) are amazing. Not the tourist trap stuff, but the actual terrain. 
The north woods are beautiful and the south coast of Superior. 
And a drive through the fox valley is pleasant. 
As for actual places, Lambeau Field is a must for a sports fan. Hit a local brewery or brew pub. There's a million of them and I've yet to have a bad local beer. Try a local cheese too, like curds warm from the vat."
My favorite interview with Macho Man Randy Savage. I die laughing everytime he pulls out a creamer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C4lK41SX-Q
"How much do you get paid to do this shit, man? Perfectly normal account up until a few months ago. Then suddenly your whole account does *nothing* but recommend that shitty VPN and link to shady promo websites. You comment on a month old thread (the thread itself has 9 upvotes) and yet within 3 days your astroturf bullshit has double that many. And that's always the story. Someone asks for a VPN rec, and every stupid comment linking to some borderline malware site recommending Nord is always highly upvoted, and their whole recent account history is just doing that same thing over and over and over. Are these just stupid bots on stolen accounts? It's so god damn annoying."
Yep.   Chromes website has a popup as soon as it loads up.  This alone peeved me out so bad I refuse to look at their site.
I have one in my yard. It's fine until that big bastard drops all of its children on the ground and I have to buy a new lawnmower blade.
"I suggest CLion.  It's commercial software, but I think you can get it for free if you're a student.  It's cross-platform, flexible, has a growing plugin ecosystem, and its code analysis and refactoring features are second-to-none. Using it as an IDE will require some familiarity with the CMake build system, since its project awareness is built on top of it, but that's good to know anyway, and for simple projects it's trivial to set up.   My only real knock on it is that the built-in debugging is just adequate.

IMHO coding in ""dumb"" text editors is for preening hipsters and old dudes whose preferences calcified decades ago, not programmers looking for the best ways to get work done quickly and well in 2019.   Powerful tools make coding much more pleasant."
"As a euphonist, I can confirm that this is accurate!"
"I've noticed that lately Chrome seems to like to freeze up on Reddit. Edge hasn't had that problem so far, thankfully."
I wish I had that amount of self control.. I don't even want to know how many bags I have consumed.
There is a great post about powerbanks in r/ultralight: [Powerbanks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/gmq3uq/_/)

"I haven't played FH3 in a while, but i'm really tempted to get back into it because of the Hot Wheels expansion. It just looks like a blast to play."
"Tambo del Inka in Urubamba Peru in the Sacred Valley between Cusco and Machu Picchu. Historically has had awesome award night redemption options (not sure about present date). Pro tip: if crowds arenâ€™t your thing, skip Machu Picchu and spend more time here and in the areas in/around the Sacred Valley."
Researchgate.net is also pretty popular among scientists for this purpose. Requesting and sharing papers takes one click.
Just give Ubuntu a try
I bought one on craigslist and there was a dead whore in it
PIAA has wiper blades and refills that contain silicone. Found them in the early 2000 and every time someone I know gets a new car I get them some. They leave a little bit of silicone on the windshield and then after a bit the water just beads and rolls off. Best wipers ever
Does your room have a kitchen? Is it hard for you to eat healthy?
Like 1080p 60hz or 1440p? 1080 144hz?
Would you consider sharing recipes or do you like to keep them private?  Because those sound magnificent.
"That's a gorgeous scent but its very strong on me. It manages to remain fresh, but the projection is immense!"
How can you check which revision it is?
