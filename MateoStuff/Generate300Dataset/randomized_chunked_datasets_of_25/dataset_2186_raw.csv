"You're right - maybe I should have said 'one of the oldest *modern* movies with a plot twist' - by modern, I mean containing actors who some of which are still alive."
neat
"\--Fresh Life (cool citrus with a pleasant oakmoss drydown, actually has some staying power too, plus quite affordable)  
\--Philosophy Pure Grace (smells like freshly laundered hotel sheets, but in a good way)  
\--D&G L'Imperatrice (watermelon Jolly Rancher, bright, crisp, tangy)  
\--Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Herba Fresca (cool, green, minty, lovely, nabbed a 10ml decant and almost finished it)  
\--Diptyque Fleur de Peau (hard to explain, it smells like fresh, clean human skin right out of the shower, it's really nice)"
50 Shades of Gray
I'd rather just do shooters if the plan is blotto.
I am told that brushing with the *Close Up* brand of toothpaste is in fact worse than not brushing at all. Is there anyone with a professional opinion who can confirm or deny?
"If you noticed that Los Agaves was a major notch above typical SoCal Mexican, then Santo Mezcal is that same notch above Los Agaves.  Same owner.  My favorite Mexican ever!"

"Had a tsa lock, opened it at security anyway to show them and clear it, closed it back up and given the ok. It wasn't the airport that cleared it that tore my bag open, it was the stop off before the final destination that did.

Thanks man. Though Sangkara had a an average roughly the same as Gilly's when he kept plus his batting is so much better when he's not keeping.
The night of is amazing!
Do you retweet @SutterCane?
Summoners war. *shudders* 5 years of my life went to being a top 100 global player on that game. I ended up resetting my entire account so I never played it again
"That's completely understandable then.  

Although I'll add the companion dog thing works really well to get them into apartments that don't allow dogs"

"Indian Express, cause its still the best option among the lot. Their supplement for Mumbai is really good for local news. I also get Hindustan Times where the only thing worth reading is Sujata Anandans column on Wednesdays. HT's supplement is good for learning inane Bollywood gossip."
argentina is either 5 spots too low or 10 spots too high depending on whether they can sort their defence out
Have you tried ‚ÄúA Dark Room‚Äù? One of the most unique games I have ever played.
"That exact thing happens in Endgame too, but instead of following 3 plotlines, you're following 4 or 5 at a time. Endgame is definitely more character focused than Infinity War, but it's still a lot to follow; the second act is significantly more hectic than any part of IW."
Did you get a chance to listen? Would love feedback.
Nope!
