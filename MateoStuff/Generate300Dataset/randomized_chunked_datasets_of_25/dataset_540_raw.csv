Not if you own a cat.
"I double checked to see if the nested genres worked out of the box or if they needed some specific setting and [found the manual entry for it](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/sub_groups.html).

Oh, and one thing I like to share that I came up with which is useful if you have lots of metadata entries in one category, like genres. I entered an empty txt file into Calibre as a new book and gave it ""AAA Notes"" for the title and ""AAA AAA"" for the author so it always floats to the top in alphabetical sorting. Alternately, use Zs to push it to the bottom and out of sight. I then tagged it with entries like ""A -----"" ""B ------"" ""C -----"" etc. In alphabetical sorting, like in the genre picker menu, they help add space and make for easier referencing for the tags, otherwise my eyes just swim with all those entries. The dummy book also holds temporary tags and tags I expect to use in the future so that they're already present in the database for me to select. I use the text file itself to add notes on calibre and ebooks in general. I have a few thousand books in my library and it's helped add some order when filling in metadata. I've since done something similar with my music library and it's helped too."
"I don't know if it would be considered a twist, but the end of The Mist made me physically get up and pace around the room dealing with the shock. I don't think I've ever seen something that was so moving and unexpected."
"Raju Hirani Is not pet director. Rakesh Mehra,kunal kohli , ashitosh gowarikar they are big names n have big hit films even without working with aamir. Karan Johar n shakun batra he refused coz of script.. I know ppl generally think his private life is mess but dude just look at his contributions through paani foundation it‚Äôs phenomenal. And his ex wife works on that foundation. He may have not spent a lot of time with Junaid ira but he is very close to ira..u can see kese zidd kar k shirish kunder directorial pe thumps up dilwaya for her cousin sister.relation  Junaid I‚Äôm confused coz he is very media shy but he makes it a point to go watch his theatre plays."
"When my dad was about 9 (1964ish) he was on a plane from LA to Heathrow in coach with his mom. The stewardess came back and excitedly asked him if he wanted to ‚Äòmeet a beatle??‚Äô

My dad said sure but didn‚Äôt really know the Beatles at that age, and only said yes because that‚Äôs kinda what you do at that age. He sat on the couch next to George (different time, airlines treated you like people), George folds up his newspaper and says, ‚Äúsoo, do ya like my music?‚Äù

My dad says (like a confused 10 year old) ‚Äúum, no‚Äù. Apparently George smiled and went back to reading his newspaper. My dad sat there like a doofus for like 5-10 minutes until the stewardess came and got him.

So George Harrison was cool to children, and my dad‚Äôs the most Stone cold 10 year old ever"
"My coworker suggested that to me, and so far I love it. I just wish it had a widget.

Also, how do you handle cash transactions?

Or if you already withdrew the money, should I not include cash transactions since it will reduce the amount twice from my banking account balance?"
Yep this is my list. I‚Äôd go 3 is Kylie and then everyone else sucks
"Peter wasn't a good looking guy just like Stan Said. Peter is more like erm ""cute"" no homo. Andrew is straight up a model üóø he's the most handsome looking Spider-Man of the 3.

">> we know that didn't work out

Clay died in 1852.  From that time onward, the awful Civil War became more and more a certainty.  America had lost its middle."
"I was 11 and watched Empire in a packed theatre with my dad. There was a collective gasp and then the place erupted as everyone suddenly HAD to talk to the person next to them. 

It. Was. Awesome!"
"My cold remedy is doing whatever I would normally do, but with more bitching."

That is what I am hoping! Or at least get me an interview. :D"
"Yeah man, I definitely get where you‚Äôre coming from. Coming off their great 2018 release combined with post humorous DOOM verses I was beyond psyched for this album.

Oh my first few listens it did seem a bit anemic and rushed, especially with DOOM‚Äôs verses kinda  haphazardly tossed in places. But the album really grew on me with repeat listens.

Also, I do agree Deck was definitely second to Eso‚Äôs devastating flow but he brought a milder energy that allowed Eso to shine I think. Also off tracks like ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù he still put up a good performance."
"Brewer's toddy.  Note:  This only works for people who brew beer at home.

Take a mug of freshly made sweet wort, add desired amount of whiskey/bourbon/scotch, and consume.  Absolutely amazing."

"There‚Äôs always a batch of movies that come out in the same flavor once one does well. Identity isn‚Äôt the greatest movie ever, but IMO it‚Äôs well done and entertaining. For the genre, there are far worse choices."

"Hydroxyapatite toothpastes have been popular in Japan for decades. Any Japanese dentists reading this?

I can't tell from the literature whether nanohydroxyapatite remineralizes better than fluoride, but people swear by it. It's said/claimed to get calcium deeper into teeth than fluoride, making enamel whiter and more opaque. Since it apparently works great, I was surprised to not find progress pics online. It's hard to even find studies lasting more than a few days. 

I started using Apagard recently. I'm making my own progress pics, and if I stick to the program I'll post them someday. I'm guessing it'll take a long time for calcium to migrate inward.

Don't fall for the ""regrowing teeth"" crap. Deep remineralization alone would be awesome."
