"I’m sure Baldurs Gate iOS and the others are wonderful and i love them all on PC, I’ve just only played Icewind on IOS so I went with just that"
Welp. It's time to replay BG2 again
I like Informant as it’s calendar as well as todo list in one package.
"Surprise i didnt see ASML yet, 692.86% past 5 years

"Who said anything about Reddit? You're really gonna die on this hill?

If you don't think it's a top 5 MCU film you're in the very small minority.

Accept it."
">  Quebec really is like a French speaking country within Canada

Well, French is the only official language of the province, and the huge majority of the population speaks French as their first language..."
"Seen them all except for The Prestige, so guess I’ll be watching that next. Good list!"
"While I wouldn't say it's the best action-adventure movie (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was a million times better), ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984) is an above-average movie in this genre.

Additional films that would fit here are ""The Princess Bride"" (1987); ""Spartacus"" (1960); and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). All three of these have plenty of action and adventure."
"CSR 2 (racing and building cars)
WWE champions ( gem crunching wrestling game)
DC Legends ( super hero rpg)
COD mobile ( really cool and very free 2 play)
Madden mobile (sucky football but I am hooked)"

"I agree a lot of the other movies ranked I'm like ""meh its somewhere along there"" but with Homecoming I really enjoyed it and think its top 3. Its such a fun movie and I feel his personality comes out more than Captain America. I like the way its paced into funny teenager segments then cool action scenes which don't go too over the top or get too repetitive."
"Yes, we know how an edible arrangement works"

I have heard this about him.  Glad to hear it's always confirmed when people talk about their interactions with him.
">Switzerland sounds like Germany on steroids, with Finnish bureaucracy, that upstairs neighbour, the optimism of your grandma, that smartass from fifth grade and Japanese punctuality.

"Lol. Going on about how people are obsessed with his race, but it feels like no one talks about it, but him. His feature on Sriracha is also very weak."
"It originally wasn't even sold because pseudoephrine worked so well, but after it became a behind-the-counter med, pharmaceutical companies complained to the FDA that they didn't have any OTC medications to sell as decongestants so the FDA let them do it. 

So yeah, money."
"* PS4

* PS3 

* PS2

* PS1

* Atari 2600

Nothing against non-Sony consoles, but they have consistently had the largest libraries of games that interested me while avoiding any massive glaring drawbacks that push me away."
That’s just my portion. I’ll PM you.
"Hoopla ain't bad -- free w/library card, lots of stuff.  (Also many other library e-software...)"
"In no particular order, I sort of like them all the same:

* **The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers = The world\-building is incredible and I just really like the way the unique and wonderful characters on board the ship all work so well together to keep the ship running \(kind of like 'FTL: Faster Than Light' in novel form, that's the best way I can describe it\).
* **Neuromance**r by William Gibson = The imagery is right up my ally, the cyberpunk noir genre is amazing and this is simply one of the best books I've ever read.
* **Forever War** by Joe Haldeman = I don't even remember much about the actual storyline of this book other than that I enjoyed every page, and the Starship Troopers\-esque battle scenes are brilliant. Very fine military sci\-fi.
* **Ninefox Gambit** by Yoon Ha Lee = Just insanely good. I love the harsh, military world and the epic space battles have some the best imagery I've ever read. Might not be something people agree with but I find it reminiscent of Warhammer 40K, at least what I've experienced of that universe.
* **Dune** by Frank Herbert = It's just a classic, really, and while I didn't enjoy it in the same way as some others, it stands the test of time and is a really enjoyable read despite its length. The dialogue really is incredible, and the book is honestly entirely driven by the fantastic characterisation in my opinion."
"I am definitely going to be adding some of these to my TBR! 

Right after I read Love in the Afternoon for the 5th time... :)"
