55506,best action and adventure novel series,I find that... difficult. I don't think I read many single POV books. It's not a very popular choice to make!
12791,best gifts for mom,"To my high school/college age step kids. Just acknowledge me. I don't want any gifts or flowers. I know my place. I know I'm not your mom.  I just want your time and I want you to talk to me and be kind to me. I want you to show me that even though I have only been married to your dad for 7 years, that you appreciate me. I'm the one that reminds your dad it's your birthday. I'm the one that reminds your dad to call you. I'm the one that says, ""let's give Jennifer/Will $50 before they go back home, even though we pay $1000/month in child support and all other expenses for Will, and expenses for Jennifer even though she is now a college graduate and makes more money than I do. I don't just contribute money. I contribute moral support and love. I worry about you like my own children. Just hug me and kiss me on the cheek and say thank you. 

Edit: Thank you kind Reddit stranger from a strange land who brought forth gold."
13826,best research paper archive,Personally I really like [Strong Inference by Platt  from 1964](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.152.2513&rep=rep1&type=pdf). (PDF download warning) It not only concisely and effectively outlines the reasons why we bother with the scientific method as opposed to observational research but also basically issued a massive 'fuck you' to every field outside of molecular biology and physics. It has some really great lines in it and it's criticisms are easy to follow and still relevant to all fields of science today.

34211,best NFL player,Xavien Howard didn't even crack the top 5 for CBs despite last year being his second year leading the league in picks. First CB with double digit ints in over a decade.
56391,best desktop monitor,I'd rather get a 4k 144hz monitor. Unless you are buying this monitor specifically for competitive gaming I think the difference between 144hz and 240hz isn't enough to justify 1440p vs 4k. 4k is a significant improvement and the only real issue would be if your pc can actually run it.
162,best terminal file manager reddit,"Let me try my best.

- In one of the other threads I was basically saying that `lf` and `ranger` are like a normal mode (i.e. as in vim) for your shell. You can assign your frequent commands to keys and work from there. For example if you want to open a file in your pager you can press a key like `i` and it will just open whereas in shell you need something like `less abc<tab>` which can be shortened a bit using aliases but still. I think this task is easy in shell but easier in file managers.

- `lf` and `ranger` gives you an alternative to `cd/ls` cycle to navigate the filesystem using only keys in the home row. You can easily drop to the shell whenever you want with a single key at the appropriate directory and then move on from there.

- `lf` and `ranger` previews make it easier to quickly get the idea about a file or directory without opening them.

- `lf` and `ranger` (and I think maybe `mc`) can be used to select only certain files in a directory by toggling them and run an appropriate command with them. Regular expressions are not always possible or easy for this purpose."

51572,best iphone case,"You’ll love it. Although saddle brown has a natural patina on leather, your black is going to be fine."
26089,best politician,"Well yes that is true. Actually, most presidents didn't do much of anything throughout most of the 18th and 19th century. The constitution doesn't give the president much power. Sure there are certain things that really stand out in that period (Louisiana Purchase was almost entirely Jefferson's doing) but for the most part, the president didn't have much power.

Washington was different than every other president after him; however, he also set the standard for every president after him. The position wasn't really defined (besides what is outlined in the constitution) until he took office."
