"Well, it depends on whether you're considering production in the hip hop sense or the regular music sense, as either camp can hold widely different definitions. On a simple level though, production deals with the musical while mixing is the audio. 

Thus, a producer will perhaps write string parts, book horn musicians and generally decide which instruments are featured on a track to get it to achieve its potential. A mixer takes all of that and adjusts the levels in order to allow those sounds to not come across as messy and to ensure everything is fulfilling it's right role. The producer will liaison with the mixer in situations where he wants specific tracks serving specific roles (for example, he may have recorded a piano part which is only intended to beef up the guitar melody line, thus it doesn't need to sit clearly in the mix and can be pulled way back). 

Hope that helps."
They say this list is based off the last few years of play. In that case Rodgers placing 3rd makes sense.

I hate this flavour with passion. Can’t stand it. Hate its smell too. My mother loves it tho.

"My guess is the fact that Nathan Fillion read it as his first audiobook might have something to do with it. Not saying it isn't good, haven't read it. Just figure that helps it get attention."
Powdered peanut butter is also amazing in oatmeal and super easy to add.
"I bought two for my new 11 Pro Max, the same ones that I have and love for my XS Max. The UAG Monarch in Red and a Rhinoshield Crashguard in Blue. I would easily recommend the monarch but it’s kind of expensive - about $65."

"Try Gatlinburg TN. I used it as a base to drive out to some nice hikes. There was a nice mix of being out in the middle of nowhere and fun tourist traps and restaurants, and everything in between, that were all equally accessible within a 20-30 min drive. It's also across the mountains from Asheville NC which is also fun."
I love how they both end with AHHHH
"I take that back, 5-6 tabs is under 800MB at the moment. I opened all 51 links in my bookmarks bar and it jumped to just over 3.2ishGB, still not terrible imo. I have the RAM, so it's not much of an issue for me."
