30639,best Mexican war to study,"Germany actively tried to entice Mexico into war with the US.

>You know, if you're German and a supposed ""Neutral"" nation is supplying your enemy arms and supplies what would you do?

Germany was just as free to buy arms from the US as the UK was. That they couldn't get them through the effective British blockade was not the United States' problem."

49535,best gaming monitor,"I'd say the 1st most important component in a pc is what's between the chair and the monitor.

2nd most important would be monitor, keyboard and mouse."
55279,best places to hike in the east coast,"Depends upon the job, as well as whether that's even relevant to the OP's question. It might be for retirement, or just visiting."
4493,best text editor,Neovim.

24986,best spiderman actor,"From my undertstanding:

1.  Toby was not an accurate portrayal of Spider-Man, but was a good actor in strong movies, at least 1 and 2.

2.  Andrew was a pretty accurate portrayal of Spider-Man, but not in particularly strong movies.

3.  The new guy is spot on in a well executed series."

7187,best iPhone,"I just got an iPhone XR yesterday with the A12 it’ll still probably be supported till 2024 or later.. and it’s still fast as hell, and the battery lasts me 2 days on a single charge. Had it yesterday for the first day at 100% and used it for 4 hours straight without shutting off the display and it only went down to 73%... it’ll definitely beat the XS or XS max in the battery department for sure, and the screen is better than people think, it’s the pixel density that matters and this has a higher pixel density than the iPad Pro and everyone loves that display... This thing is a beast still and it’s the perfect size, not too large like the max or plus phones but bigger than the smaller iPhones for sure. I love it so far! Plus if you go the used market you can get it cheaper than that price sometimes. I’d definitely recommend this phone. It’ll last you at least 4 years if you need it to without any issues."
