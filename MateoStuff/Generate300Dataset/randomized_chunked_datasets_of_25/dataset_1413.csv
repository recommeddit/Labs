The puppy is met with greater favor from the boys' father, prompting Charles to go berserk and beat the shit out of Adam. Charles's love for his father is forever unrequited.

* [Fried dough and soy milk](http://www.jonasapproved.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/huge-tree-pastry-09-dou-jiang-you-tiao-480x360.jpg).  *The* staple breakfast food.  Your choice of salty or sweet soy milk for dipping the fried dough sticks in.  The dough stick is hollow-ish inside, so you get this delicious gush of soy milk with each dipped bite.
* [Taiwanese breakfast burritos](http://www.thethirstypig.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/092320071395.jpg). Take a dough stick, some egg, pickled veggies, and savory [rou song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong) and wrap it all up and pack it densely into a covering of sticky rice.  Comfort food at its best.
* [Egg omelettes](http://sinosoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/img_0702.jpg).  Make a [Chinese crepe](http://www.travelblog.org/Photos/5573248) in a pan, crack a fried egg on top of it, add green onions, and fold that up into a roll.  Chop it up, eat with duck sauce (dark/tangy/sweet) or your Sriracha equivalent.  Crispy exterior, steaming hot soft insides.
* [Stuffed ~~biscuit/pancake/whatevers~~ box dumplings](http://www.chinatownconnection.com/images/binbreak.jpg).  ~~I have no idea what these are actually called, but~~ you take dough, stuff it with something (chives, in this case), and pan fry it.  Crispy outside and flavorful inside.
* [Shao bing you tiao](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/2718807262_4fb991e1f7.jpg).  Take a fluffy Chinese pastry crust with sesame seeds, stick a fried dough stick and some seasoned braised beef and cilantro inside.  Nnnnnnnnnngh.
* [Fried steamed buns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shengjian_mantou).  Steamed buns, but pan fried.  It makes all the difference.  You can also get something similar called [steamed little ~~dragon~~ basket buns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao).  Pork meatball wrapped inside flour skin (softer than dumpling skins and more tender).",best breakfast foods

65211,"Actually AT&T offers $25 discount when you renew over 30 days early.  Then I got refill cards at Target buy one get one 10% off plus my RedCard adds another 5% discount.  The trick is to get the exact amount worth of cards with discount.   
I believe I got (4) $70 cards which would be $280 minus $14 discount and then another $13.30 off for the RedCard discount made a total of  price of $252.70 for $280 worth of pins.  Pretty sure the extra $5 expired and dropped off.   

I joined Sept 2019 and renewed this past August.  Not sure if this is regular pricing for renewals or what, but my account now shows $275 due Sept 21, 2021 with no mention of renewing 30 days early this time.
