26624,"Hi- welcome to the hobby :-) 

There are so many good games out there you could end up with dozens of different top tens. You'll probably hear/read the term 'gateway' game- used to describe good games which help introduce the various mechanics/rules you might encounter in other 'heavier' (more complex) games. You could consider looking at these games initially. 

Note- there is nothing at all wrong with these gateway games- they are immensely popular and important to the hobby. Some names you may have heard of: Settlers of Catan, Carcossone, Ticket to Ride. 

A genre that really got me into the hobby was co-operative games. You and the other players are working together to ""beat the game"". There are many many available now- the first one I tried was Pandemic. 

I'm sure others will chip in with great suggestions. 

Do you have a rough player count? I.e. How many you will usually be playing with? 

Happy New Year",best board games
