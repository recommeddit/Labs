54499,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Offtopic but, out of those mice that you own, what is your favorite to least favorite in terms of aiming. I have the viper mini and haste, but the xmr1, m42, and hati-s are on my radar and was wondering what you thought since you own the other 2 that I have."
12505,best gifts for mom,Gave her a baby. It was her first grandchild.
30410,best Mexican war to study,"The First Word War: Not only are the battles interesting, the ramifications of what happened afterward: Destruction of the European Fuedal System, The Communist Revolution in Russia, Fascism in Italy and Germany, the Second World War.  I think all of it is fascinating."

17814,best Kardashian,"lmaoooo blac Kardashian 

I thank Jesus that rob caught on before it got that far.

also I just watched that episode too, I've been rewatching seasons 10-14 and its so sad seeing rob struggling. him crying at the doctors office because he didn't want to take his shirt off and then later on at therapy because his family was not listening to him...it truly breaks my heart.

However, if anything tho I think that will make him a great father, that he will be all about hearing his daughter out and making sure she is heard and that she knows her emotions are valid, especially if he continues with his therapy."
56554,best desktop monitor,"In most modern AAA games, you'll probably get a solid 60fps at max settings. Lower them down a bit and you could reach 100fps or so (I'm guessing, you'll need to look at some benchmarks). It really depends on the games you play"

Apple leather cases do not age well at all. Also, the patina on all the ones I've owned can be wiped off. Still a good case tbh and still what I use."

44582,best items under $100,"yes but don't get one of the many shitty offbrand ones on Amazon.. takes forever to register the heat. Go with the Weber. It's ~$10 and is as close to instant as you can get.

Edit: Weber 6750 Instant Read Meat Thermometer"
67182,axios alternatives reddit,I just love it’s interceptors
16542,best pet for toddlers,"I think you're likely to have your hands full trying to keep carnivores alive.  Those terrariums are pretty rough.  If they are the ones from dunecraft they guarantee their seeds will grow.  If they dont sprout, send an email to customer service."
26633,best board games,Never played Animal Upon Animal. I’ll have to look it up. Super Battle is a nice step up from the original Rhino Hero with each player having their own hero to move each turn. Instead of building a tower you build buildings that can potentially weave into each other.
72337,best keyboard switches,"This probably would be the difference in language-they do have an aspect of tactility that I think is important for preference, but that they click (and for navies, a lot!) which changes their designation with switch taxonomy.

I use novelias (almost the same spring as a navy, but in a box royal for a similar tactile bump without the noise."
7302,best iPhone,"I would suggest go for 11 after 12’s launch, it will definitely get a 100 Dollars price cut. According to me an iPhone will last upto 5 years from launch. Basically XR is good until September 2023. If you are planning to use the phone for more than 3 years than don’t go with XR, go for 11 instead."

24482,best anime,"You sure love them classics, u watched Serial Experiments Lain yet?"
52911,best hiphop album,"Son, you just need to sit down and shut the fuck up when grown folks are talking about things they know more about than you - like hip hop music. Somoen asked for essential hip hop albums and you mention Kanye west? Oxymoron? You gonn recommend some killer Bruno Marz too? What part of suburban Ohio are you from? GTFOH boy!!"
66092,best college in california,"r/DVC is now up.        I wont be going there much longer, but we can try to get it going..."
