47857,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"TI-89 all the way. Solves systems of equations, differential equations, systems of differential equations, calculates limits, derivatives, definite integrals, indefinite integrals, matrix products, vector functions, graphs in 2D and 3D, and has any extra apps you could ever need for statistics, finance, engineering, etc. It also has crazy battery life and a massive catalog of any function you could think of (http://tibasic.wikia.com/wiki/Catalog_(89)). It can do pretty much anything you want."

45500,best gaming system,Skate 3!
471,best terminal file manager reddit,"Glad to see your efforts on improving `nnn`. I use it a lot, it's a godsend on RasPi-like SBCs. But I found also good usage for it on my main Linux PCs.

For everybody pushing `ranger`: I use `mc` and `nnn`, each for different purposes. A test of `ranger` didn't give a good impression for me - too confusing, kind of in between `mc` and `nnn`, but not as good as either.

You should try `nnn`, and also the other utilities /u/sablal wrote. He has a knack for writing useful and lean apps. `nnn` is less than 30kB for the binary, with a ton of features. In contrast, look at `Etcher`, which clocks in at 100MB as an AppImage (only available Linux option) and doesn't anything else besides writing an image to disk and verifying it.

I am disgusted by this trend and wish there would be more like `nnn`, not like `Etcher`."

Most of the interview he says that he needs to put much more effort commpared to other actor e.g. Ammitabh, Dileep Kumaar, Raghubeer day and Zaira waseem.

70710,best movies with a cool twist,Don't really see what the 'twist' is in that one.
1275,best ice cream flavor,"You’re so wrong. It’s not even the best Ben and Jerry’s flavor. It looks amazing on paper, and in the store. The flavors really are pretty bland though, not a strong vanilla or chocolate flavor - mostly just sweet. Also, eating it becomes a process of trying to just get that one last chunk, eating the whole thing, and feeling ill.   
  
It’s not a bad flavor, at all. But certainly not the best. Cherry Garcia stomps Half Baked."
29153,best calendar tool,"I usually combine couple of calendars in 1 view. But you are right, it can be viewed in one place, but not managed from one place, so you still need to manage two apps"
41525,best instrument to play,"It depends completly on what kind of music you want to make, and what you want out of your instrument. 

I prefer acouatic guitar, personally. Piano is also great, and it is more suited to visually getting theory, but it's not portable, and you can do bends or easy chromatic slides, and the timber sounds like a piano. Piano sounds cool for piano stuff but acoustic guitar sounds cool for acoustic guitar style stuff. 

Piano is also useful for doing production stuff with midi, but so is guitar, especially with some of the tech available that will only get better."
