53515,"I do understand that but it's such an odd level of vomit. Not like ""ew imma be sick"" and then you puke and feel better... no you can set your watch. 15 minutes after taking the pill he violently scream-vomits every two minutes bent in half turning bright red and sweating profusely until I get him to the ER where they pump him full of benadryl and zofran. Its freaking bizarre. After the first couple of heaves he's not even puking anymore hes just violently heaving. It was listed as a reaction until the third time when a physician changed it to allergy in the chart. Each time the reaction/allergy/demon posession gets worse. 

I know the standard for an allergy is systemic immune reactions, and I also know allergic reactions can get worse over time with increased exposure. In his case each time hes exposed to amoxicillin his gastric system reacts immediately and worse. That he isnt getting hives or difficultly breathing or swelling might be luck and exposing him a few more times may cause it but that would just be stupid. That's why its listed as an allergy in his chart.

Trust me if he just got an upset tummy or the shits he could deal with that. That's not what he gets.",best medicine for a cold

26336,"I joined the Navy when I was 18. I had no idea 18 and 22 were so far apart attitude wise.. But I was 22 nearing the end of my time in and new people would get to the boat and be 18 and 19. 

A lot of people don't realize this but 18 - 23 year olds kind of run the Navy. They are the ones out there actually doing the serious things that makes things operate and function. And some of them are morons..

Every time before we'd pull out they'd tell us, *Don't give out dates, times, locations, etc.* And what would they do? (especially the females...) 

They'd go on Facebook and post how our ship (Yes, they called a US warship by name when doing it..) would be here around this time, or over there around that time..",best politician

4124,"My advice-look into Penn Foster and Ashworth college.  Both are accreted, real, legit online schools.  Note-they DO NOT accept federal aid, student loans or FASFA.  Why?  Because they are pay as you go.  They are the only schools that offer low monthly payments (or you can pay all at once per semester) and they do accept nearly all transfer credits. They are 100% online distance learning.  In fact they won't release your grades/allow you to enroll in the next semester until the current one is paid off.  Both colleges run about $1200-1300 for 5 courses/15 credits (3 credits each) and offer AA, BA and a couple masters degree options.

Both offer tutoring, online assistance and availability to instructors and fellow students to ask any/all questions you need to complete the lessons.  Cost is the same per student, regardless of where the live in the states
