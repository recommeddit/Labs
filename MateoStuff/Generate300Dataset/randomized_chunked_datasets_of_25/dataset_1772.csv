53515,best medicine for a cold,"I do understand that but it's such an odd level of vomit. Not like ""ew imma be sick"" and then you puke and feel better... no you can set your watch. 15 minutes after taking the pill he violently scream-vomits every two minutes bent in half turning bright red and sweating profusely until I get him to the ER where they pump him full of benadryl and zofran. Its freaking bizarre. After the first couple of heaves he's not even puking anymore hes just violently heaving. It was listed as a reaction until the third time when a physician changed it to allergy in the chart. Each time the reaction/allergy/demon posession gets worse. 

I know the standard for an allergy is systemic immune reactions, and I also know allergic reactions can get worse over time with increased exposure. In his case each time hes exposed to amoxicillin his gastric system reacts immediately and worse. That he isnt getting hives or difficultly breathing or swelling might be luck and exposing him a few more times may cause it but that would just be stupid. That's why its listed as an allergy in his chart.

Trust me if he just got an upset tummy or the shits he could deal with that. That's not what he gets."
73634,best battery bank,"For sure, that makes sense. Also that's max output, not simultaneous on these. Just check the specs!"
64759,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Seems like everyone that I have spoken to is raving about Los Agaves. I will have to try. Can't wait!
60172,best freezer brand,My Samsung sounds like your model. I got 8 years out of it.  Then the repair guy (a friend actually) scorned me for even buying a Samsung.
18272,best YouTube video,no don't
26336,best politician,"I joined the Navy when I was 18. I had no idea 18 and 22 were so far apart attitude wise.. But I was 22 nearing the end of my time in and new people would get to the boat and be 18 and 19. 

A lot of people don't realize this but 18 - 23 year olds kind of run the Navy. They are the ones out there actually doing the serious things that makes things operate and function. And some of them are morons..

Every time before we'd pull out they'd tell us, *Don't give out dates, times, locations, etc.* And what would they do? (especially the females...) 

They'd go on Facebook and post how our ship (Yes, they called a US warship by name when doing it..) would be here around this time, or over there around that time.."
51202,best rap album,"1. *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy*  
2. *The College Dropout*  
3. *Late Registration*  
4. *Yeezus*  
5. *808s & Heartbreak*  
6. *Graduation*  
7. *The Life of Pablo*  
  
For what it's worth, I do like every album. I don't think any album is particularly bad in any way, even if it's near the bottom."
19015,best YouTube video,Alright. Cool. See ya
62460,Best RPG game on PS4,It is not shit and it is a type of rpg. The genre is pretty diverse actually. A game does not have to be like W3 or Skyrim to be an rpg.
53803,best medicine for a cold,"Catnip tea, you can even grow the herb yourself :) 
I know it sounds crazy but we've been using it for as long as cats have been loving it hahah."

4124,best online college,"My advice-look into Penn Foster and Ashworth college.  Both are accreted, real, legit online schools.  Note-they DO NOT accept federal aid, student loans or FASFA.  Why?  Because they are pay as you go.  They are the only schools that offer low monthly payments (or you can pay all at once per semester) and they do accept nearly all transfer credits. They are 100% online distance learning.  In fact they won't release your grades/allow you to enroll in the next semester until the current one is paid off.  Both colleges run about $1200-1300 for 5 courses/15 credits (3 credits each) and offer AA, BA and a couple masters degree options.

Both offer tutoring, online assistance and availability to instructors and fellow students to ask any/all questions you need to complete the lessons.  Cost is the same per student, regardless of where the live in the states

7093,best iPhone,"Have a X, but planning on getting the 11 in the next couple weeks. While I like the OLED display the old display is high quality, and I when I scroll the OLED screen canâ€™t keep up as much as the older tech. Once the refresh rate increases I will give OLED a try again!"
69480,best major to study in college,"You're certainly correct that at best it is unclear that the market will rebound any, though we'll ultimately have to wait and see what things look like when the economy fully recovers. The only thing I would say is that the only reason graduates haven't decreased is because applications have only been going down the last [two years](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/law-school-applications-are-collapsing-as-they-should-be/272729/), and of course there will be a three year lag from applications going down to graduates decreasing."
68732,best science fiction novel,I really enjoyed the Three body problem trilogy and the red rising trilogy. Red rising is like game of thrones in space and the three body problem has been spoken on here enough so you get the gist
35611,best alcoholic drink,A porcupine themed superhero.
4159,best text editor,"Ditto.  Emacs is potentially infinitely powerful, running its own domain specific extension language.  Not for the faint hearted, but the nuclear option for those who care to wield such a thing."
