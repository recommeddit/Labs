10442,best suitcase lock,Good advice but bear in mind that hotel safes are [notoriously easy to get into](http://supportspy.com/blog/archives/660).  Keep important items with you and make a copy of your passport to store separately.  There are plenty of sites offering good tips about [how to stay safe when traveling](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/5-travel-security-tips.htm/printable).  Do your research before you leave.

17520,best iOS game,"Yeah, the combat is awkward, but itâ€™s simple enough to get the hang of (even though I am not at all coordinated). I liked it a lot! But, I was both extremely sick and the world was shut down when I was playing it. I think rebuilding the town and walking through forests and caverns made it more therapeutic than usual."
34770,best NFL player,"Ya.  People can use bellichick as an excuse but Brady has won.  He plays the most important position. He controls the offense.  And he has made it to 7 straight championship games?  Come on.  That's like LeBron making all those finals in a row.  It's just too easy for them.  They find trouble against the very best opponents, but more times than not, Tom Brady has won the super bowl when he has got there.  

You play to win the game. He's done it."

12105,best gifts for dad,"I get a lot of whiskey gifts from people whose whiskey knowledge is limited to the fact that I like whiskey.

I'm not too big on scotch. I currently have full bottles of laphroaig and honey flavored jack daniels. :/ 

**Edit:** For those of you interested in said bottles, you can have my whiskey, but only if you come to Santa Barbara, California and drink it with me."
62969,Best Data Science textbook,"What kind of data science are we talking about? Intro to Statistical Learning is a reference book on the foundations of machine learning, and may or may not be useful depending what you end up doing. It also won't be useful if you don't have a statistical background, and the book does not go over said background. 

In general I think the question needs to be narrowed down a bit based on educational background and interests."
