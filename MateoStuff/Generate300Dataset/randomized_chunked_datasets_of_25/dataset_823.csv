But, I was both extremely sick and the world was shut down when I was playing it.

34770,"Ya.  People can use bellichick as an excuse but Brady has won.  He plays the most important position. He controls the offense.  And he has made it to 7 straight championship games?  Come on.  That's like LeBron making all those finals in a row.  It's just too easy for them.  They find trouble against the very best opponents, but more times than not, Tom Brady has won the super bowl when he has got there.  

You play to win the game. He's done it.",best NFL player

62969,"What kind of data science are we talking about? Intro to Statistical Learning is a reference book on the foundations of machine learning, and may or may not be useful depending what you end up doing. It also won't be useful if you don't have a statistical background, and the book does not go over said background. 

In general I think the question needs to be narrowed down a bit based on educational background and interests.",Best Data Science textbook
