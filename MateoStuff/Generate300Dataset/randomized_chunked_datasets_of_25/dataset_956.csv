32024,best hotel to live in,"This is very European. In the south of France theyâ€™ve turned a lot of monasteries and former convents into high end hotels. My favorite was one in Lyon because it was the most aesthetically pleasing hotel Iâ€™ve ever been in, clean clean clean and so symmetrical, perfection! And the food was amazing."
49034,best gaming monitor,"I just recently purchased an LG 27GL850-b, and then I purchased a Viewsonic vx2758-2kp-mhd as a secondary monitor.  The Viewsonic was $200 cheaper, and I think I would have been satisfied getting two of them in the first place instead of paying up for the LG.  

I looked up the differences between these two models when shopping, but I don't remember what they are anymore, because I can't tell any difference with day to day usage.  I'd be fine gaming on either, but I use the more expensive LG  as the main monitor since it's ""supposed"" to be better..."

560,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"> Any tips guys? Maybe a better software than evernote? Or maybe Wacom one is not intended for what i'm using it for?

Just to make sure, we're talking about this [Wacom One](https://www.wacom.com/en-de/products/pen-displays/wacom-one) with a screen, right? Even if you had the ""One by Wacom"", the previous device that was only a graphic tablet, you'd be perfectly fine - it would just take a bit longer to get a good handwriting down without a screen.

First of all: Your writing will get better the more you're accustomed to writing on a ""slippery"" screen. The beginning looks always messy, but once you've got your hand/eyes-coordination down, it'll work just as fine (or even better) than on dead trees.

Regarding your software choice:

- I gave Evernote a try years ago (I've been using digital handwriting programs since 2010) and was underwhelmed by the amount of features that Evernote had back then. The price they were asking for was too high for the little convenience that Evernote offered
- If you're using Windows 10, you might have [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) already installed. Currently the different versions of OneNote are [kinda messy in terms of feature-parity](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-s-the-difference-between-the-onenote-versions-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US), but if you're on Windows, just make sure to download the [OneNote 2016 Desktop Installer](https://www.onenote.com/download). There's also a OneNote app that you can get from the Microsoft store, but that one doesn't have the same back-up features that the ""desktop""-version offers. You can use both in conjunction, but I heavily recommend setting up the ""desktop""-version first, just to make sure that you have local backups of your notes in case the ""sync""-feature shits the bed.
- There's also a Microsoft ""garage""-project in development that's called [Journal](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/journal-a-microsoft-garage-project/9n318r854rhh?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). It focuses on digital pen input and has some neat additional ""ink-first"" features like pen gestures.

If you need to write on PDFs and make annotations, I've written down [some recommendations in a previous comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wacom/comments/fiinft/looking_for_a_pdf_reader_that_allows_you_to_write/fkjaznc/). Don't even try to print PDFs into OneNote and write on top of them. It's a recipe for disaster and messed up notes. If you need to write on PDFs, think about a good folder structure, throw your folder-layout into the cloud and use whatever PDF-editing program suits your needs best."
3801,best college for research,University of Missouri probably should not be on that list anymore. The school has gone to utter shit. It was mostly only a party school anyways besides nursing and journalism and their journalism department is getting shit because all the professors are leaving and going to Missouri state university.

54891,best water filter,"A lot of this is based less on making the water safer than it is on making the water more palatable. 

In the US and most developed countries, tap water should be pretty safe.  These filters help remove some metallic taste.  It is especially good at removing chlorine, which is often people's big taste complaint with tap water. 

I'm guessing if you have old municipal pipes, it is likely you have more dissolved metals in your water and potentially higher chlorine content to help with disinfection.  



Edit:
** I don't mean to hijack this comment, but I just want to say that the top comment is not sound science and based on his anecdotal experience.  For example, activated carbon is KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO REMOVE ORGANICS! (which is contrary to what the author has stated, he may have been dealing with alcohols or diols, which aren't easily removed by carbon)**"

 [https://www.powerbankguide.com/anker-power-banks-things-to-know/](https://www.powerbankguide.com/anker-power-banks-things-to-know/) 

After doing my research I decided the RAVPOWER 6700 was the battery for me. You'll notice that this list of the best powerbanks doesn't even include Anker. RAVPOWER 10,000 might be good for you, but you should read through it yourself.

54585,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"It's a hard call. I think the otsu v2 is a fantastic middle ground between zero and hien. Hien is great for tracking at the cost of a little control. For me, otsu v2 is that perfect middle ground.

That being said, I can play valorant with my hien pretty well, hell I play valorant with my shidenkai ðŸ˜‰. I think you can get adjusted to anything, just takes some practice.

In terms of ordering, for me I always get it right from their website as you have the most options and I trust it after ordering 8 pads from them. Never tried Amazon, though they're obviously reliable if you can get the pad you want."

I think your underestimating what Disney has done the past decade. Universal had 2 slam dunks with both Harry Potter areas, but the rest of their additions are duds. Disney has had a lot of huge upgrades and additions with none of them are underwhelming, and 2 of them being looked at as possibly the best rides in existence (Flight of Passage and Rise of the Resistance)."
