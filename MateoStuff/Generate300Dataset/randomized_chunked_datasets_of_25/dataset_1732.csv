14554,best romantic novel,"I'm reading Boyfriend Material right now, my first book of his, and I am absolutely taken by how sharp, funny, and clever it is. I've laughed out loud several times and I'm only 25% in. I can't wait to read his others!"
13807,best research paper archive,"More is Different - By Nobel prize winner Phil Anderson.

Many advisors make their prospective students read this paper before they are willing to take them on as RA's.  I still read this paper about once a year.  It helps me stay inspired as a scientist.

33910,best Pokemon game,"Great everything but the fucking region you mean? Yes. 

Gen5 overhauled battling so much, the games had so much content. Just a really shitty story, with a shitty antagonist, shitty Pokemon actually tbh. Genesects story is fantastic though."

24757,best anime,It’s beautiful. I love the weird trippy stuff.
56470,best desktop monitor,"Just to put it out there, Asus will soon be releasing a successor to the PG279Q called the PG279QM, which includes a native gsync module (which should hopefully eliminate the bad input lag at 60 hz that the XG279Q suffers from). If you're fine with waiting, I would honestly recommend that, as everything else on the market seems to have at least one fatal flaw."
16437,best sunglasses for fashion,"Hey, I did say

6200,best Netflix documentary,Last Dance
37094,best amusement park,"Good for CGA, holy crap."
33926,best Pokemon game,"It’s really subjective because they’re all extremely similar games. When you strip away the graphics and the proper nouns, they all play basically the same. Whatever OP plays first will probably be a fine experience. I’d maybe recommend Fire Red or Leaf Green, but that’s probably just my nostalgia for Red/Blue talking. White and Black are excellent choices as well, and aren’t so new that they’ll break the bank."
3386,best webcamera,"I am aware of what you said, but regardless of if you're starting, thinking about starting or are already knee deep in streaming, purchase what you like, because they've got other uses that aren't restricted to just streaming, so if you're thinking of buying a c920 and are thinking about streaming, you should take into account the other uses than just streaming if you go ahead and purchase it, because if you find that streaming isn't your jam, you know you've got a c920 for other uses instead of thinking you've wasted money."
71933,best movies with a cool twist,"Tiiiiiime, is on my side...

Yes it is..."

25121,best spiderman actor,"lol what Spiderman 2 is considered one of the greatest super hero movies ever, it's easily better then anything in the current mcu"
31647,best hotel to live in,"I stay in the Hilton Family.  I have close to 1 million points (I've only been doing this a few years).  I rank #6 in all-time stays at my current Hotel.  Believe it or not there are a few people that have been living here for more than 2 years.  The main perks just have to do with building relationships with the staff.  I can get any request attended to immediately.  I don't wait in line, etc.  Basically, the rules don't apply to my like they do the other guests.  This is my home.  Occasionally, there are other people from my company that pass through.  Once the staff knows they're with me they can get any room, late checkout, etc.  No questions asked. Oh, and I've gotten offered free tickets to local events (theater, sports)."
23104,best celebrity,"My mother used to work for a major network and had to babysit John Travolta for a couple of hours back in the early 90s. She said that he was the perfect gentleman, and he mailed her a handwritting thank-you letter, as well as an autographed photo (she still has both). To this day, she won't hear a bad word about him."
