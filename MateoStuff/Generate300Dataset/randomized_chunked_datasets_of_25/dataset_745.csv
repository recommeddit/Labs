1238,best ice cream flavor,Cookies and cream with cheez-its. It's the perfect sweet/creamy/savory/salty combination.
36988,best roller coaster at six flags,"Tatsu, Twisted Colossus, X2, Full Throttle, Riddler's Revenge, Revolution, Goliath, Ninja and Lex Luthor are the best rides at Magic Mountain.

I also enjoy Viper and Batman. Scream is hit or miss. Superman is worth it if the line is short."
34536,best NFL player,"Yeah, when I saw he was taken off the list I was annoyed. Then I saw Eugene Upshaw made the list and didn't know what the fuck was going on."

24500,best anime,"> plan to do ZZ then Chars Counterattack and be done with the UC.

You should 100% watch Unicorn (the 7 OVAs, not the 22 episodes) after Char's Counterattack then, but other than that solid plan!

>And damn i really need to watch that movie then lol, thanks!

[](#helmetbro) Commie's subs for it are solid if you can find them, although their typesetting for the second movie wasn't as fancy as what they'd done for the first one."
34852,best NFL player,That's the correct decision.

10406,best suitcase lock,"I just spent [$226](http://www.chiefsupply.com/pelican-carry-on-case-w-wheels-black.html?gclid=COGIgr-Sn74CFRQmMgod40EAQw) on a suitcase, and then another $40 to have my incredibly heavy luggage shipped.... but damnit, those TSA fuckers are not getting in my suitcase and taking my toothbrush!"
16623,best pet for toddlers,"I would not suggest a hamster. They are not particularly cuddly and take more work than you might think. 

Also you seem very nonchalant about the prospect of your cat dying. I'm not sure ""our cat just died let's immediately get a new pet"" is the right attitude to have. 

I think a fish would be appropriate."
11055,best backpack for college,"I've used a Mountain Hardwear 28L Agama backpack (also a great pack) for 7 years and it recently kicked the bucket on me midway through law school. I used it for school as well as camping, hiking, and traveling. I just got a Gregory pack and I love it even more than my Mountain Hardwear one. I'll attach a link to it. It's a top loader, which is great because I can stack things in it easier than a zip pack. It's also super water resistant, which is awesome (and what sold me) because it rains a ton where I live and I walk to school. In fact, I carried all my books, notebooks, and laptop in a torrential downpour this morning and everything stayed totally dry. The pack just sheds off water. Check it out man. Backpacks are something that can make your life way easier or they can just carry stuff. Knowing what you're looking for is the key to getting 5+ years of useful life out of one.

The pack I went with:

15654,best sunglasses for fashion,"If you want inexpensive quality aviators these are the go to in my mind. They are lacking in options though, they do one thing and they do it well. History of the brand is also great."
46145,best trick or treating candy,"Glad to see the joy you experienced as a child when you hit a house with full size candy is completely dead in you. I still remember a number of those moments clearly, and I want to give that to the kids in my neighborhood. How sad of you to be so jaded."
