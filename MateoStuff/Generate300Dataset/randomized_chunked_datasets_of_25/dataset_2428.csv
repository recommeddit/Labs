57661,"Prada L'Homme smells a bit more mature and luxurious than YSL L'Homme. What they have in common is that they both have this clean and inoffensive vibe.

YSL L'Homme is what you would wear when visiting your in-laws or your grandparents. Prada L'Homme is what you would wear to your job.

I would personally recommend Prada L'Homme, because I think Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme can be worn in the same situations that one would wear YSL L'Homme, but it's also more versatile.",best cologne

In all honesty I am really slack with the studying as I have a toddler and am two months pregnant, so seem to leave assignments to the last minute, but I have still been achieving high marks so apparently I am understanding the course work. 

Because my university offers it both on campus and off campus I doubt it will affect my job prospects at all when I'm finished, as its exactly the same degree. 

And for those wondering it is a Bachelor of nursing to become an RN, not an EN course",best online college
