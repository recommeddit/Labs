"It may or may not be good, I haven't seen it, but the amount of clapping a film gets at Cannes isn't a reliable measure of its quality. The festival's audience is known to give long standing ovations, sometimes to pretty meh movies.  It's mostly because most of the film's creators are in the audience. Some good movies have been booed there too."
I had to mush my face into my pillow to avoid waking my housemate haha
"Tiger King (I know, but even though it starts slow it’s fucking crazy and awesome)

Don’t Fuck With Cats (only 3 episodes and batshit)

"I made an emergency kit for her a few years ago and she still loves it. I sewed a few ziplock bags onto a potholder and added a button so that it folds in half and protects everything inside it. Each ziplock bag had a theme, like car care or medical stuff or personal care. It stays in the bottom of her purse and is really useful."
Yes!  This is what I should have recommended :)
"Request is great but old and bloated from all the polyfill added during years of development

Some of the fixes/polyfill are completely useless as of today with node 10.x.x

[Request’s Past, Present and Future](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142) is a great post about it"
A BBQ as in a grill or as in a smoker? AFAIK Hank Hill only had a grill.
"My go-to mixed drinks are either a Cosmopolitan or a Malibu and Sprite. If there's a decent selection for wine, I'll have a Moscato. I prefer my drinks to be sweet and fruity with very little flavor of alcohol.  Your preferences may vary depending on your sweet tooth."
My personal favorite is the LG Ultrawide from your list.
"You asked what you NEED, and a lot of these answers aren't addressing that. Here is what you need. There is a ton more, but no matter where you work, as a web developer you will need to know this stuff:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SQL is the basic database language. MySQL, postgresql etc. are all different implementations of the same language. Just learn SQL however you do it. 
* Any of the three major backend languages. People are very opinionated about which one. Ruby, Python and PHP are the most major. There are too many advantages and disadvantages to go over here. But you need to know one of them for starters. 
* MVC frameworks. Understand how to separate the model, view and controller in your programs. 

Good luck!"
I wish!!
"Yes I'm very interested to see how this whole RoundUp issue plays out. I'm not sure if the genetics in those with Glyphosate-founded tumors will be different from those that arise normally. If so, they would almost be a new, distinct population, and it would all but verify that the chemical was a root cause. We'll see."
"Greatest events of ww2 in color. 

Contains what it says on the label. Recolored footage from the major turning points in ww2."
Which of Kanye's albums?
Down the Rabbit Hole even introduced me to the most toxic internet community in the world: Youtube comment sections
"I don't really listen to pure biology podcasts. Most of mine are more general sciency, that cover Biology here and there.

Top ones of those would probably be:
Nature Podcasts.
Skeptics Guide to the Universe.
Naked Scientists."
"Darn Tough socks. 

They have different lengths and merino wool blends. Life time warranty and made in USA. I sent in a pair with a hole in them and got a new pair in the mail."
"Oh good, Im glad Im not alone with this thought, I just finished Excession and it was the last one I had left to read so naturally Im going through the mourning stage of finishing a book series by a dead author.

  
Excellent books and really a refreshing look at AI. I am so tired of the ""evil-AI is going to enslave/kill mankind"" tropes present in many other sci-fi."
"Same director, Satoshi Kon. All of his films are excellent."
Yes! Our dog is the first pet I’ve owned and although I’ve always wanted a pet it took me 2-3 years to finally decide to get a dog. Before we got our dog my husband kept saying he was surprised I hadn’t come home with one as I worked next to a pet store in a mall. I told him I wasn’t just going to get a pet (especially a dog) on a whim and definitely wouldn’t support a pet store!!
VODKA!!! Wait wahat was the question?
"Bladee - The Fool

"FYI. There are many webcams around not being used. I posted on my local Facebook group is someone had one lying around they didn't use. Got one for free that is OK. Colors are a bit off but I turned it over to black/white and its great. Also black/white is a bit different so I stand out some more. I ended up just spending money on a six pack that I gave to the guy I picked it up from.
It's Cheap and I feel better not just buying something but reusing something that others don't need any more."
"Basically the entire menu is copied from
The Lark/Lucky Penny. The food’s not bad, but it’s not exactly unique."
