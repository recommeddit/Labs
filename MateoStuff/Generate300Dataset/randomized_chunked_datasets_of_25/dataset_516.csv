43208,"I remember watching True Detective, Hannibal, and Fargo all during the same summer. It might be because I watched them so close together, but they almost felt like similar plots and themes told through different creative voices. 

I'd also second Mindhunter and Sharp Objects. They're the obvious choices, but there's still something to the confidence and freshness to Hannibal and Fargo that I think reminds me more of that first season of TD.",best detective show

12468,"My mom has passed, but I am a mom and I will tell you what I really enjoy. 

I got a bathrobe. 11 years later and I still wear it as well as have a collection of other bathrobes.

Candles. I never buy candles in the store because I feel like it's a ""splurge"" or an item I don't actually need. So when I get a candle, I am always excited to use it. 

House shoes. I also have a collection of houseshoes, slippers, fuzzy/warm socks. 

A Chromecast / Kindle fire / camera - all things I used many and multiple times.

A diamond necklace. Like with the candles I do not treat myself to jewelry, but when someone I love buys me something I do cherish it and wear it often.",best gifts for mom

Or jump in to the world of modern folding knives and buy a Spyderco Delica for $85. If it doesn’t make your life better I’ll buy it off you. 🤷‍♂️",best items under $100

33890,"The best Game by far in my opinion is Emerald. Emerald has an amazing story line and great characters (all though May/Brendan are a little undeveloped) the Pokemon are amazing and Hoenn is the most diverse and exciting region and Ruby and Sapphire are almost as good (if you don't have an old GBA or emulator handy I'd recommend getting the remakes even though they are not as good, 

Black 2 White 2 is the worst games by far don't tell me there not because they are.

45392,"I have a PC, PS5 and a Switch. I mainly game on PC and sometimes PS5. The Switch I mainly got to play with my girl and the PS5 for exclusives and as a media device for  my LG CX OLED.

If a game is hinted or announced for PC I will wait for that version. I rather play everything on PC but if a game interest me enough and is 60fps on console I'll play it.


I will always opt for PC given the choice though. Why? Well I can afford good hardware and the experience on PC(144hz+,KBM,custom settings,mods,etc) is just far far superior.

 Also how do I feel about PS exclusives coming to PC? Not enough of them and not nearly soon enough. Let's get all of them on PC so they can shine at their maximum potential.",best gaming system
