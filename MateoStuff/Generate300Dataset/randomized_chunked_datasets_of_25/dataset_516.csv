73238,best Linux distro,I love mint! It’s such a great distro. I’ve been using it on my desktop for a while now.
43208,best detective show,"I remember watching True Detective, Hannibal, and Fargo all during the same summer. It might be because I watched them so close together, but they almost felt like similar plots and themes told through different creative voices. 

I'd also second Mindhunter and Sharp Objects. They're the obvious choices, but there's still something to the confidence and freshness to Hannibal and Fargo that I think reminds me more of that first season of TD."
47478,best state to visit in the United States,My dad let me out of my cage on my birthday for 5 minutes.  The basement was pretty cool with all the bugs and leaking water.  I was able to get a few drops to drink before i was locked away again.  Always wanted to go back
12468,best gifts for mom,"My mom has passed, but I am a mom and I will tell you what I really enjoy. 

I got a bathrobe. 11 years later and I still wear it as well as have a collection of other bathrobes.

Candles. I never buy candles in the store because I feel like it's a ""splurge"" or an item I don't actually need. So when I get a candle, I am always excited to use it. 

House shoes. I also have a collection of houseshoes, slippers, fuzzy/warm socks. 

A Chromecast / Kindle fire / camera - all things I used many and multiple times.

A diamond necklace. Like with the candles I do not treat myself to jewelry, but when someone I love buys me something I do cherish it and wear it often."

68092,best science fiction novel,Love the Dispossessed!
44927,best items under $100,"Co-sign. You don’t need to be weird about it like us knife guys are, but if you go to Amazon right now and get a little folding knife- a $10 Opinel for example, somewhere in the #4-#6 range- you’re going to find way more uses for it than you think and it’ll make your life way easier.

Or jump in to the world of modern folding knives and buy a Spyderco Delica for $85. If it doesn’t make your life better I’ll buy it off you. 🤷‍♂️"
26125,best politician,His comments right now on Trump and his supporters are just amazing. Someone asked him about Trump TV and he said that it would give his supporters something to watch while they brushed their 1 tooth. He also said that it's clear there is 30% of this country that shouldn't be allowed to run anything.
55728,best action and adventure novel series,Wheel of Time seems a little obvious but it really fits
8874,best toothpaste,"Proven to greatly reduce the occurrence of dental carries (cavities). You can get too much, in which case you get fluorosis."
33890,best Pokemon game,"The best Game by far in my opinion is Emerald. Emerald has an amazing story line and great characters (all though May/Brendan are a little undeveloped) the Pokemon are amazing and Hoenn is the most diverse and exciting region and Ruby and Sapphire are almost as good (if you don't have an old GBA or emulator handy I'd recommend getting the remakes even though they are not as good, 

Black 2 White 2 is the worst games by far don't tell me there not because they are.

[emulatoronline.com](https://emulatoronline.com) this is a good virus free emulator where you can play emerald fire red and also platinum"
68307,best science fiction novel,"I think it's worth noting that while A Deepness in the Sky takes place first chronologically, It was released second and I think it should be read second considering the mystery of Pham is important to the narrative of A Fire Upon the Deep."
67548,axios alternatives reddit,"Not annoying at all. await fetch(url).then(res => res.test())

It' necessary because obviously you don't always want to parse the response body, that would be a huge waste of time. You can implement a wrapper around it too."

57425,best water brand,"All of them?!  Jeez people, stop with the plastic."
18053,best Kardashian,Could have put him with Kendal or something they both need the votes lol
45392,best gaming system,"I have a PC, PS5 and a Switch. I mainly game on PC and sometimes PS5. The Switch I mainly got to play with my girl and the PS5 for exclusives and as a media device for  my LG CX OLED.

If a game is hinted or announced for PC I will wait for that version. I rather play everything on PC but if a game interest me enough and is 60fps on console I'll play it.


I will always opt for PC given the choice though. Why? Well I can afford good hardware and the experience on PC(144hz+,KBM,custom settings,mods,etc) is just far far superior.

 Also how do I feel about PS exclusives coming to PC? Not enough of them and not nearly soon enough. Let's get all of them on PC so they can shine at their maximum potential."

47794,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Oh, I don't need one, thanks. It's just weird to me that these relics are perpetuated by current educational practices."
