38640,best newspapers to read,"There are hundreds. You could do a lot worse than skimming the [wikipedia page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye). It's got them, and a link to even more. 

In general, the front half of the magazine is more investigative journalism and gossip, and the back is more satirical stuff. 

Most of their columns don't have a named author. It's for a number of reasons, from tip-offs to the fact that the real author is a well known journalist elsewhere."
1925,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"NYer here. Ginos Sicilian is the closest to a NY pie. Bettina is good for the thin, wood fired pizza (think margarita pizza). Rusty’s is edible, fast, and all over the place (it’s a local chain)."
59849,best perfume,"In no particular order.. 
""Cleopatra"" - TOCCA 
""Black Tulip"" - Nest 
Especially Escada 
Crybaby Milk Perfume"
33589,best electric car,"I like the ID.3 more, the 4 is just too big for me (coming from a Golf which looks like Mr. Bean‘s Mini next to the ID)"

20310,best workout music,"The drop in Det Som en Gang Var always gets me.

Perhaps a leap but you ever listen to Drudkh?"
51495,best iphone case,"I just buy AppleCare+ and enjoy my iPhone the way it was designed. If you don’t want to buy AppleCare+ or you don’t mind using a case, I would buy an official one as they always felt better than other ones."
20109,best workout music,Go hard gettin busy with it
26264,best politician,"Are you saying his opposition to the Civil Right Act was 'speaking the truth'? It's true he didn't hide his racism, but I wouldn't call that an admirable quality."
58976,best perfume,"It is a very light scent, I agree. I almost didn't buy it because of that but I love the smell. It's class in a bottle to me."
13816,best research paper archive,Aaaaaaaaaaand it's gone
2381,best headphones,"Best Bluetooth set I have heard is AirPods Max, but they really are only an option if you are already on iOS.

Supposedly the 800$ bang and olufsen h95 are top notch as well."
72849,best Linux distro,something that has many preinstalled packages (working out-of-the-box) like mint and ubuntu.
35870,best alcoholic drink,"Oh man, as a fellow Old Fashioned fan, I've found I actually CAN'T enjoy it at most bars.  I've become a snob.  If it's not made how I make it at home, or at least similarly, I just end up complaining internally about how I want to go home and make it right."

26033,best politician,Except for when he sold out his base and movement to endorse Hillary after it was exposed the DNC rigged everything against him and his movement/supporters had no chance in hell from the start.
71464,best movies with a cool twist,"Ace Ventura 

""Thats it! Einhorn is Finkle. Finkle is Einhorn. Einhorn is a man! Oh my GOD! Einhorn IS A MAN!! *uuugggghhhh*""

♫*i know all there is to know about the crying game*♫

*retching noises*


""NO!....NO!!!....NO!.....""  *Cries in shower*"
72522,best keyboard switches,"It's not the extra weight, it's the plunger. You can't release without raising farther so rapid, repeated keying is more difficult. Think ""mash X"". Blacks, I think, have the same weight without the plunge.  

Also the model M doesn't have cherry switches at all. They're buckling springs. Blues are built to somewhat imitate them."
71540,best movies with a cool twist,"Yeah I know what you mean about Lupin and Lily. Sirius is certainly an interesting character in this regard. Don't get me wrong, I think he's 90% good and admirable, but I still do think you can call him a hypocrite though because of his inconsistency. He explicitly condemns Crouch for being a dick to Winky and yet he treats Kreacher with cruelty only a few months later. 


I think Sirius lacks self-awareness: he wouldn't even make the link between Crouch and Winky and his own treatment of Kreacher;  he never looks back on what he and James did to Snape with the sort of regret that Lupin shows. I doubt it would even cross his mind to. He's not a bad guy but I do maintain that he's got a slight nasty streak."
8359,best toothpaste,"> get a new one per month

meanwhile i've been using the same damn brush since 2016"
