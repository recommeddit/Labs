"Once, I saw Method Man perform with Wu-Tang, and he was the only member that came out after the show to sign autographs and talk to fans. He hung out for about 15-20 minutes.

I got to meet him at Rock the Bells last year, and I told him that I thought it was really cool that he stayed talking to fans when he didn't have to.

He looked at me and said, ""I like to treat everybody like they're somebody.""

Good on you, Meth."

"Superman is about 1000x better in the front than the back in my opinion. This sounds crazy to most, but I rank it as my number 5 coaster for the insane intensity and ejector airtime. (I have 77 credits)"

"Corazon Cocina is SUPER good, just at a higher level than anything twice the price. The quesadilla de mercado especially, dear gawd. I'm super bummed they had to close their lower State location, but I'm glad the original in Public Market is going strong."

"I have two as I switched majors recently, first

Environmental Studies: Pros: Its nice to work related to the environment which I respect, I got tons of respect from people who did also, and the classes are interesting. 

Cons: Im a first generation and my entire family thinks I am wasting my time because they never heard of it, the pay for a job seems to be less than the other major I wanted and more education needed.

CIS Pros: I can likely get a job with a AA degree at a school district and I love technology.

Cons:Ill likely be asked by family for any computer problems forever."

"There are quite a few surprises on this list, but the biggest one for me is Eve no Jikan. I've never seen anyone talk about that movie/OVA, so I didn't really know it had fans out there (besides me lol)."

"In no particular order, here's seven.

1. I said no particular order, but Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has to come first. It's hard to put into words why I love FMAB. The story, the setting, the mix of magic and technology, the intrigue, the music, the animation - it's great. Plus, it has the distinction of being one of two shows that has made me cry. The first time I watched it, [this scene](https://vimeo.com/262321586) hit me right in the feels. 

2. Samurai 7. A sci-fi twist on a classic story. It's certainly not most people's favorite, but awesomeness is in the eye of the beholder. I love me some samurai.

3. Chrno Crusade. The second anime to make me cry. Dat ending. If an anime can move my black and shriveled heart, I've got to mention it Also, this and Samurai 7 are both animated by Gonzo. That's not why they're my favorites, but it's a ""fun"" bit of trivia.

4. Ghost in the Shell. I love me some cyberpunk, and GitS was the first cyberpunk anime I watched. It's such an amazing world. And the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARTLckN9e7I) is phenominal. 

5. I'll say Castle in the Sky, but that doesn't mean that I don't love the rest of Studio Ghibli's films. If anime is a mistake, I don't want to be correct. I mean, show me the non-anime film with floating castles, robots, a princess, flying ships, pirates, and Mark Hamill. Well, that's Star Wars, but other than that. Seriously, tell me if there's another movie with these elements, let me know because I want to watch it. And again, I must cite the breathtaking [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRNqLRL1_RY). Damn, that's beautiful.

6. The [Monogatari series](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari). It's ~~difficult~~ impossible to describe, but it's amazing. I'm not sure who the art director is, but they deserve an award. Love it.

7. It's not done yet, but Death March. It's got a stupid name (I mean, Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody? Seriously?), but other than that, I love it. MC is OP, yet having a high level skill doesn't necessarily mean you *know* how to do something. For example, he's got Max level fire magic but can't chant any of the spells. Plus, it's funny. He's surrounded by a (mostly) loli harem but isn't attracted to any of them. So he sneaks out and goes to brothels. I like it so much that I went and read the manga and have started the web novel. I've never done that before."
Nice work. I never bought Nikes until they came out with flyknit. I'm a huge fan cause then I don't tear holes in the uppers of my shoes every damn day.
