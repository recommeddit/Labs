5853,"Whatever you do, don't look at this decision as the one that determines your career. Whatever language you learn first does not need to be the language you use in your first job, or the language you use 5 years from now.

Learning to program is hard. Learning a new language after you already know one is easy in comparison.

A lot of us recommend Python first because it's such a well-designed language. It's designed to make things easier for beginners but it's still powerful enough for pros. It's a great way to learn, and you'll still find it useful no matter what you do with your career.

In comparison, PHP may be one of the worst languages ever invented. It's a cobbled-together mess of inconsistent and broken patterns borrowed from other languages. If you have to use it, go for it - but I wouldn't recommend learning it first because it will teach you bad habits. It'd be better to learn a good language first.

JavaScript is somewhere in-between. It's definitely clunky, but it's gotten a lot better over time. Using TypeScript (which is compatible with JavaScript) is a great alternative. Also note that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all go together - they're not separate jobs; you'll be using all of them together.",best programming language for web development

32206,"Honestly same. I would often send people to smaller ""mom and pop"" vineyards, but it had to be sold as this boutique-y experience. If you told someone ""So there's this little farm down the road that sells some great wine, you literally just drive up and meet the farmer/owners since they don't do reservations"", they wouldn't go. But if you said ""I personally know the so-and-so's, they have this micro-vineyard tucked away from the main road where they make some of the BEST pinot in the insertnamehere valley, I highly recommend it. They are so small they don't even take reservations, otherwise they would book up and I'd never be able to get you in!"" the guests would coo and bolt for it.
