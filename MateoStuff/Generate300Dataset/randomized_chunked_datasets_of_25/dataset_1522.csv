I certainly agree the quality does not match up to what is on campus I can't complain. There's also the distance, considering San Cat is about a mile from campus but if you ride a bike you can get your exercise WHILE riding to class. 

San Cat houses the most freshman out of all the dorms so if you wanna be surrounded by your class, that's a plus. Oh yeah, we got a pool too.",best dorm hall at UCSB

68476,"If you're open to more Sci Fi:

The Gap Sequence; first book is ""The Real Story: The Gap Into Conflict"" by Stephen R. Donaldson. This story is basically about how, despite superfast travel, space is just too damn big to police. What happens when law cannot prevail? The first of this series the hardest book to read; the author is fantastic at putting his characters into states of nigh-unbearable tension, and book one is all about building the tension for the three main characters who comprise the handle of this umbrella of a story. Get through it, read books two through five, heave a sigh of relief that it's over. Again, very good, but tough to bear. 

Otherland: City of Golden Shadow (book one of four) by Tad Williams. A good sci-fi that plays with the dangers of virtual reality.

Old Man's War by John Scalzi. What a wild ride through the universe (?). It begins thus; ""I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife's grave. Then I joined the army. Visiting Kathy's grave was the less dramatic of the two."" Others here have suggested that it lacks some of the depth that many sci fi greats contain, and they're not wrong. I compare it to great sci-fi like I compare home-made gourmet food to high-quality restaurant food; both are good, but one you don't really have to work for it. Just get a copy of this book and read it, then keep going through the rest of the series.

The Expanse, by James S. A. Corey. This series-cum-TV show is wonderful. Co-written by two authors, it was impossible for me to tell how they separated their work. Did one build the universe, the other the dialog? Chapter by chapter taking turns? I could never tell, it was so seamlessly written. I've heard the show is lackluster, but the books - oh, wow, the books are gripping. Again, just do it.

Charles Stross. Anything by Charles Stross. Who cares where you start (just, pick book one if it's a series). ""The Family Trade"" is a pseudo-fantasy, so if you're looking for strict sci-fi, stay away. I love Glasshouse, Iron Sunrise, Singularity Sky, and Accelerando, in particular, but it's all good.

If you enjoyed Ender's Game and the rest of the Speaker series, but were yearning for something aimed a bit more toward the Earth story, and politically thrilling, read the sister series Ender's Shadow. It follows Bean as he grows from an over-intelligent child into a truly influential figure.

Anathem, by Neal Stephenson. This sci-fi goes all philosophical on your ass, but it disguises it very well for a long time. It's hard to get into, but once this story bites you, it will NOT let go.

The Commonwealth Saga, by Peter F. Hamilton. It begins with a paired set of novels, Pandora's Star and Judas Unchained (read in that order). Hamilton takes a seemingly disparate group of characters and so elegantly braids them into a powerful yarn. Two secondary series - the Void Trilogy and a pair of books about the Abyss - take many of the same characters out and play with them after they've had time (lots of it) to grow and mature. 

Seveneves by Neal Stephenson. I'm not going to tell you a damn thing about any part of this book, at all. I'm just going to tell you to read it. If you should choose to read it, don't get the sparknotes, don't get a quick synopsis, don't read the sleeve. Allow this story to light you afire with its creativity. It is one of the most emotionally powerful sci-fi books I've read in a very long time.",best science fiction novel

I donâ€™t do it because itâ€™s trendy. I do it because itâ€™s neutral. When youâ€™re flipping, itâ€™s not about appealing to a certain buyer, itâ€™s about not being unappealing to any buyer. 

That being said I donâ€™t do anything crazy with design. Every house gets white trim, mocha or white hardwood shakers, and granite counters. Around here a mid level house is 30 years outdated so just slapping white trim on the walls excites buyers.",best color to paint with
