18137,best Kardashian,"Okay so Kendall went out to dinner with another model friend, and they basically dined and dashed. So the waitress followed them out, asking them to pay and Kendall threw money in her direction (didn't even ask if it was enough and apparently it wasn't) and bounced. She didn't even hand it, she legit threw it in her general direction and the server had to pick up the money off the ground. Apparently, Kendall is famously a really awful tipper"

13441,best spreadsheet editor,"Not meant to self advertise but i thought i will keep the ball rolling. I created this stock portfolio tracker because i couldn't find a portfolio tracker that tracks stocks by individual transactions.

Whether its buy, sell, dividend, splits and bonus issues this can track.

The next thing is that being an international person. I want it to automatically update prices from exchanges like Germany, France, Malaysia and Singapore. 

So it actually grabs the last price from Yahoo Finance.

There are other good plus points as well:

* You can access your portfolio from any computer with Internet access. Right now, smartphones are powerful enough to power a web browser and it’s HTML and JavaScript pages, which Google Spreadsheet runs on.
* It acts as a backup should your laptop or desktop gets trashed.
* If you would like to share the viewing and editing of the portfolio with friends, family and associates you can do that with the sharing feature.
* If you are a finance blogger you can append these data on your blogs.
