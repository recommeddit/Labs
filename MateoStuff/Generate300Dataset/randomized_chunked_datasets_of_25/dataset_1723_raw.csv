It still makes me uncomfortable recommending my paid stuff so the emoticon helps :)
"So do the packages squawk ""Help! Help! I'm being abducted!""? Because if not, I bet you could reprogram them to!"
"Cool to see A Grand Don't Come For Free crack the top 100. The Streets doesn't often get the attention it deserves. The last song, Empty Cans is brilliant."
A Spanish film called the invisible guest
I wouldn't say it had an insane plot twist but I thought it was entertaining. Guess you didn't think so?
"Je suis au Angalis.

Look guys IM doing it!"
I feel the color is a little funky but it's probably because I have two monitors with different screen types. For the price it's been great. Also it overclocks to 155hz and I haven't noticed any negative side affects.
"Anything by Arthur C Clarke, specifically Childhoods End and the Rama books."
"I agree with you on Magnum, but the ranking seems to reflect the average person's opinion about it in this subreddit, though.

I didn't mean to seem disparaging to coasters that didn't make it in the top 500. I used that word as a simple way to make the context of what I'm doing more digestible to the average reader."
Titus is my spirit animal
I need to ask you to stop. That... showering... is making people nervous.
Places like /r/fragsplits really helped me get a variety of different high end fragrances.

Something like this?"
"Degree plan?

Got to rep my school WGU though. 3k for 6 months, flat rate. Minimum of 12 credits in those six months, but you can bang out more if you want."
"The Departed, The Game, Moon, Duplicity and K-Pax"
Piano hands down.
"Every skin care routine should include a wash, moisturizer and exfoliate.
Cerave is good and budget conscious, as well as The Ordinary. 
ALWAYS use an SPF in the morning even if it is cloudy. Make sure it is 30+. Mineral sunscreens are preferable as natural and not bad for the Ocean Reefs.
Exfoliate a few times a week, preferably with a chemical exfoliant like Salicylic Acid or Lactic Acid. Physical exfoliants for your skin, like that garbage St. Ives, just damage your skin more than it does do what an exfoliant is supposed to do. Do this only in the evening as it makes your skin more prone to sun damage.

Lots of YouTube videos out there. Check out Hyram"
Mullvad and Windscribe are both great options.

"I went with Spigen Ultra Hybrid clear for my 13 Pro. I had the clear MagSafe case from Apple and didnâ€™t think it was worth spending $49 again. Plus, I never bought a MagSafe charger."
The Family
I finally invested last year in a $60 pillow and the reduction in my migraines (frequency and severity) means I'd happily pay double that.
"Another redditor was telling me to wait for black Friday deals for a better laptop, do you think they'll be better options by then?and thanks for info"
Sorry so late. Yep. Dark City is the director's cut.
Check out some Eric B and Rakim too!
