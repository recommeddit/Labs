1. No Other Love by Candace Camp

2. Undecided by Julianna Keyes

I think the only thing they all have in common is that I absolutely fell in love with the characters (although, the two HR's have weirdly similar titles lol). These are definitely my big comfort reads, the ones I go to whenever I need a pick-me-up.

24610,"there is really only 1 actual timeline. the rest are stand alone series with 1-2 seasons and their own lore and typically have some major themes and symbols in common. conflict over rights between people from space(space colonies and other planets) and people from earth, some children stumbling into giant robots and being the best pilots ever, and [and almost always blonde guy who shows up as 2 characters one as himself the other as an alter ego with a fancy mask.](https://www.memesmonkey.com/images/memesmonkey/bc/bcc94d208482e08616e2a7f6b3dce04c.jpeg)
