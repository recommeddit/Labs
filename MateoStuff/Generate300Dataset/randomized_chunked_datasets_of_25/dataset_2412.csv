7147,best iPhone,[Hereâ€™s a link](https://www.theverge.com/pages/wallpapers) to those ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ wallpapers
31221,best country to live in,Taiwan!
15443,best tree for the garden,Horse chestnut tree! You got to play conkers once the autumn came!
31884,best hotel to live in,"Great info, thanks! Assuming it wasn't the capital, was it a sizeable city?"
11138,best backpack for college,"definitely a swiss gear backpack like the one suggested by Aorian, I dont have the same one he's suggesting but I've had the same swiss gear backpack for over three years now, and it's still in really good condition and there's plenty of room for everything you'll need to carry."
14452,best romantic novel,"You mean I have to choose?!?! Well fine, here it goes:

1. No Other Love by Candace Camp

2. Undecided by Julianna Keyes

3. Well Met by Jen DeLuca

4. The Ex Effect by Karlsa Sorensen

5. Like No Other Lover by Julie Ann Long

I think the only thing they all have in common is that I absolutely fell in love with the characters (although, the two HR's have weirdly similar titles lol). These are definitely my big comfort reads, the ones I go to whenever I need a pick-me-up. They definitely change over time, especially as since I'm always reading new romances, but number 1 will always stay the same (read it when I was 16 and have read it dozens and dozens of times since)."
70266,best major to study in college,I just googles career quizzes and just did a bunch of random ones
11724,best gifts for dad,"My oldest is now 20. He's given me one of his GI Joe figures, a Lego stormtrooper, a Hot Wheels and a 5 pack of gum. They're all in a little wooden chest. I don't think he knows."
22126,best celebrity,I think it has to do with reddit gold.
58712,best cologne,"Can you smell the difference from edp and edt? I only have edt, but it's my favorite perfume so far."
31418,best country to live in,damn im in the top 15. thanks btw!
20752,best workout music,sit down
23190,best social networking site for CS,"Sounds like you don't have much back end experience. This is _not_ a beginners project. I'd try to find a pre-made solution of some sort, it's probably not feasible to code something like this from scratch with your experience level.

I think there's some social media-esque wordpress plugins and other crm extensions around, does anyone know more?"
3394,best webcamera,"Speaking of webcams, if you have a laptop even the one built into is good enough to get started with in my experience."
24610,best anime,"there is really only 1 actual timeline. the rest are stand alone series with 1-2 seasons and their own lore and typically have some major themes and symbols in common. conflict over rights between people from space(space colonies and other planets) and people from earth, some children stumbling into giant robots and being the best pilots ever, and [and almost always blonde guy who shows up as 2 characters one as himself the other as an alter ego with a fancy mask.](https://www.memesmonkey.com/images/memesmonkey/bc/bcc94d208482e08616e2a7f6b3dce04c.jpeg)

Once you learn the formula you can just start assigning the parts in the new show and it snot that hard to follow cause its basically the same story. [same same but different, but still same.](https://media.giphy.com/media/C6JQPEUsZUyVq/giphy.gif)"
26648,best board games,"Just played Forbidden Island, it was a lot of fun"
66322,best soccer team in the world,"I'm obviously biased, but I figured we'd just about scrape the top 5, at least in the all-time list. Recent years obviously haven't been so kind."
52138,best iphone case,Is everyone against Flip cases or something??
73832,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Yes, thatâ€™s what I recommend. Using one of those silicone Apple Pencil tips."
40780,best instrument to play,"Synth! Also synth+drum machine, and midi everything"
19920,best workout music,This is a playlist I listen to. I like it cuase it ranges in songs so it fits every mood... https://open.spotify.com/user/datguy1998/playlist/5cBF8OsNBESKAUDeb6J4yu?si=O3CxJnagRImz07NULlJvKg
68774,best science fiction novel,"It's a great book, but I agree it's probably not the best up there. I'd probably put Forever War, Childhood's End or Rendezvous with Rama above it."
2332,best headphones,the sennheiser momentum 3 sounds like absolute garbage and is probably the worst thing sennheiser makes (including the hd820). xm3/4 sounds wayyy better and has better anc anyway
61035,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I think that the British version of The Office still has the belt. It's just such a flawless masterpiece. Nary a wasted second. 

But I loooooove Peep Show! Me and the wife are just constantly watching it on a series loop."
