30533,"Have you read Battle Cry of Freedom? It contains a chapter specifically on the Mexican-American War as pretext for the Civil War. Although it's a large book (just under 1,000 pages) the Mexican-American War is woven in there frequently after that initial chapter.

The author does delve into military history form, but it's not quite his focus. Not sure if you're looking for information on specific battles, of which there is some, but this book has a bit of a wider view. 

I'm not sure if he covers the actions at Chapultepec extensively (has been about a year since I read it) but he does do an excellent job presenting the information of a battlefield.

So that's from what I can personally recommend, but doing a little snooping I've compiled a short list of possible options (I worked for two years in a new and used book store, so I feel I have a good eye for relevant books).

[-Another campaign history, published by U of Oklahoma]
