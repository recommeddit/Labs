54355,best medicine for a cold,"Most of these tips are concerned with strengthening the immune system. The problem is, you can't strengthen the immune system in a week. That's why the only proven way to shorten a cold is zinc, which interacts directly with cold viruses rather than by strengthening the immune system to in turn fight viruses.

More than that, cold symptoms are a result of your immune system's fight against the virus. Successfully strengthening your immune system while you are already overrun with cold virus will only make your cold worse before it gets better. You want it strong enough recognize and fight off invaders before the first symptom.

This is how steroid injections in response to a cold work. Steroids work to weaken the immune system in order to suppress cold symptoms, not fight off the cold. This is not something you want to do unless you're both healthy and extremely invested in the upcoming event.

The key is prevention. Improve your immune system ahead of time. Eat your fruits and vegetables. Get vitamin D. Incorporate moderate exercise into your schedule. Wash your hands before eating or touching your eyes, nose, or mouth in public. If using soap, lather for 20 seconds and dry your hands on something clean (not your pants!) Hand sanitizer is your friend as well; Alcohol-based hand sanitizer poses less risk of creating superbugs than the antibacterial soap in most public bathrooms, and is more effective against most bacteria and viruses than soap if your hands are not covered with dirt and grime, just germs. Make sure it's at least 60% alcohol and you use enough to keep your hands wet for 15 seconds."

26729,best board games,"I was the same way, I watched various reviews and was like “Eh, seems like an okay dungeon crawler.”

Then a friend in a different city suggested we try it out in TTS. We played enough to both retire a character and then restarted the campaign with another friend. We recently added a fourth player and finished the “main” storyline. 

At some point, I began to feel bad that I was getting so much entertainment from the game without having paid for it. I didn’t actually want a physical copy of the game because I didn’t think my wife would ever actually play it with me. So when the Frosthaven campaign came out, I used the no reward option to give the creator some money. 

But then Jaws of the Lion came out and I thought I would take a chance to see if my wife would like it. Turns out, she loves it. A few plays into it, I joked “Maybe I should actually back Frosthaven” and she said “Wait a minute, I’m not actually getting upset at that idea...” but at that point, the pledge manager was closed. Thankfully it opened back up a month later for wave 2!

Yesterday, my wife said Gloomhaven was her favorite game and we finally painted our miniatures too."

32790,best free online grammar checker,"I don't think any of the available tool can correct each and everything. For example, the meaning can be completely different by changing a comma but no tool can recognize it. 

[ProWritingAid](https://www.writinghelp.net/pro-writing-aid/) will work fine if you are a native writer. Otherwise, learn to write regularly and use Grammarly along with it.

The best way to minimise the mistakes is to read the content loudly and check if something doesn't sound proper but this will only work when you have faced the problem already. I must say tools really save your ass some times.

70372,best major to study in college,"Chem major here as well. I had started a YT channel back in 2018. It was a gaming channel. Got fed up of gaming tho so I got rid of it all. Still got 20 subs :p. 

I'd advise if its something u really wanna do then go for it. Come out Ur comfort zone. Depending on the bids you'd like to make, u could do stuff without u being in the vids. So slides etc. If Ur into animation include that as well. Whenever u start Ur channel. Just reply here. I'll go sub :)"
