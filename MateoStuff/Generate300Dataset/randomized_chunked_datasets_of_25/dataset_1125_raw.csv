We have a garage but can't precondition the car in there because it runs the gas engine even when plugged in.
That's because Apple changed the material on the 12. It had a great patina before that but for some reason the one from last year was shit. I'm wondering if it's the same this year as well.

How's Berseria in comparison to Zestiria? Finished Zestiria and felt just ok for me.

"This is awesome! Thanks, u/stetsdogg!

I'm looking for the cheapest eSIM phone plans for expats that just allows me to have a phone number presence in the USA for the cheapest yearly cost and lowest suffering (i.e. not having to refresh every week or so). 

How do you recommend I best filter for those?"
"The Aeropress is fantastic if you're mostly brewing one or two cups at a time. It takes me between three and four minutes to brew my coffee, including the time it takes to boil the water. Perfect if you're in a hurry to get going or just want your morning coffee ASAP."
Pretty much sums up how I feel.
"My dentist recommended spitting out the toothpaste, but not rinsing with water. Allows the fluoride to stay in contact with your teeth for a bit longer."
Skyrise apartment turned Airbnb. It's not a hotel technically but I'm counting it. 87 floors up and we could see all of West Kowloon up there.
I was on the 30/mo plan forever ! It works great

"AT&T prepaid offers their $65 unlimited plan for $45/month a few times a year. 

Pretty sure T-Mobile prepaid offers unlimited for $50/month.

Straight talk is $55/month for unlimited."
"Edit: reposting because my original cut off.

My taste varies a little bit with the popular consensus but I am the creator of /r/Czarface so I'm not just a casual fan at least lol.

Definitely check out the last album with DOOM, I think they all brought it including Deck and the production nails the comic book/sci-fi niche. It all sounds ""Volcanic"" for lack of a better word but looking at the album cover it's a good match I think. (Songs: Forever People, Nautical Depth, Stun Gun, Captain Brunch)

After that my favorite Czarface project is their debut; it has great variety in the instruments used for the production. The opening tracks have kind of an X-Men cartoon feel with heavy drums and droning synth bass. The features all kill it, it's hard to describe the sound of this album overall because it kind of shifts towards funkier, live band stuff with guitar and 60's orchestra samples. The features all have solid verses with my favorite being Madlib's Brother Oh No on ""Czar Rafaeli"". Deck and Eso are less polished but their raw chemistry is undeniable. (Songs: Air Em Out, Cement 3's, Hazmat Rap, It's Raw)

However, many people think the best Czar project is Every Hero Needs a Villain. This album has great features and a cohesive, retro-rock sound to it with lots of neat guitar riffs and kick ass drums. I feel that the album is too same-y and hard to listen to the whole way through repeatedly, but it's definitely one of their better projects (It has a song with DOOM too, Ka-Bang, and its solid)

(Songs: Czartacus, Junkyard Dogs, Escape From Czarkham Asylum, Sinister)

Their other projects are ok but inconsistent and the only essential listening I would say is Fistful of Peril, that's just ok"
But what if I *want* a keylogger
"I can't imagine blues in a fast paced game. Reds are too sensitive, I'm with your assessment of Browns. Best compromise between reliability and speed. No clack of blues though."
"A nice glass of Vernors, a warm blanket, and hot soup is all I've ever needed."
Cool. I've been near there a few times. My grandmother used to live in Crestview. Anyway you'd think all the carriers would have areas around the base covered pretty well.

"I live in NC, but Milk Duds? That’s the one you save for last and question if you should really eat it. People might buy them because they’re cheap, but they’re not loved.

Fuck yes to Reese’s cups and Nerds."

I hope you'll enjoy it. I can't stand most pizza here
"If anything with the pandemic I prefer Home Depot. They actually limit how many people are in the stores and the last couple times I’ve ran to Lowe’s I couldn’t even find a parking spot. I prefer Lowe’s for almost everything, lumber I’ll get at an actual lumber yard tho because both stores tend to have crap lumber"
