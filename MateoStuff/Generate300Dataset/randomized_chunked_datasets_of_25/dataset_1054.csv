25567,"Fair enough, the reason I rate Richards over Sangakkara are the eras they played in. Richards dominated attacks like no other at a time when fast bowlers reigned supreme. No other batsman had the same aura as he did during his career.

Sangakkara is pure class, and a bit underrated imo, but even he doesn't have that same feeling of omnipotence that a Richards, Tendulkar or Lara innings did.",best cricket teams of all time

59788,"My girlfriend wears this, and I think it’s one of the best perfumes I’ve smelled (perhaps a limited number, but whatever).  
Anyway, I was in a class last semester and for whatever reason, my captain was always standing at attention if you catch my drift... it doesn’t happen in other classes really, so I didn’t know what was up.  
Then after a while it hit me.  The girl next to me wore the exact same perfume as my girlfriend every day.  I had literally been classically conditioned to get a boner in response to this smell.",best perfume
58292,"keep in mind that what smells great on me, and is my ""go-to"" cologne won't necessarily smell good on you, and may smell completely different. lots of different factors play into it, and mix and match with scents you find favorable to wear, and see the reaction. that being said,

evening/going out - dolce&gabbana the one gentleman

light/summer/daytime- chanel platinum, RL romance, aqua di gio

everyday- chanel platinum, varvatos artisan, armani mania

i guess the theme is light, citrusy, fresh scents for the day, and heavier woodsy, leather scents for night. those are some of mine, and i constantly get compliments on how good i smell. 

also, stick to the 4 areas and nowhere else. inside the wrists and on the neck below/behind the ears. both sides. the only time someone should smell your cologne is if they are CLOSE enough to.",best cologne
4816,"My experience with Lowes last year upon closing was a nightmare. Same as you OP we needed a washer dryer and fridge on day one. 

Ordered online and didn't receive word on anything for weeks until I called the local store myself. Took several different managers just to find the order and at that time I was informed that I wasn't contacted because they were still ""waiting on the washer.""

Anyways, it was the wrong unit and long story and several deliveries later and I got sense of it all. 

In the end there was absolutely *zero* benefit to opening up a Lowe's line of credit as the 0% APR in house financing is no better than what you could get opening up a line with your current bank. At the end of the Lowes term it goes up to 24%! 

That said I ended up transferring the balance to a Bank Of America card anyways so I'm just trying to save you the trouble. 

Open a credit card and shop at whichever store you want.",best home improvement store

The Sixth Sense. Saw this in theaters when I was young and it blew my mind.

  


Planet of the Apes. Also saw this at an early age, rented it from Blockbuster and it caught me off guard at the end.

  


I was too young to remember much about watching the original Star Wars trilogy for the first time, but I'm sure Empire Strikes Back threw me for a loop.",best movies with a cool twist
