13209,best gifts for mom,"Can you take a day off from work and let her sleep in and veg? My husband does this occasionally and it's glorious. 

I realize all jobs do not lend itself to this luxury."

11749,best gifts for dad,"Love my dad, but yeah I'd get the pans and the guns. I'm looking forward to the pans most of all.

Hope he lives long, but soon as he passes I'm grabbing those pans."
22239,best celebrity,"Rick Falkvinge, Head of the Swedish Pirate Party. Spent quite a while talking to him - pretty cool guy.

Simon Singh is also very down to Earth."

3993,best online college,They're still online.
56029,best action and adventure movie,I really enjoyed Ready Player One.
56378,best desktop monitor,"Thatâ€™s nuts, I canâ€™t believe they show that estimated delivery time and you guys are just sitting and waiting. Iâ€™m guessing the 3 year panel swap is the reason for not just grabbing it in stock on Amazon then?"
37117,best amusement park,"By the way, I added more info to give context to the ratings.

Check it out, Morey's Piers has one coaster in the top 500, but SIX that are not. Hence, only one ranked coaster, which essentially means it's Great White vs. Desperado."

3433,best webcamera,"Also got a C270 to start and am still using it. Have you figured out how to set the exposure manually? I play at night and the light from my monitor over exposes my face, besides that it works fine"
46825,best hand santizer brand,"That, and you're actually wrong. Soap and water actually doesn't seem to do much unless you use an antimicrobial soap (e.g., containing chlorhexidine). On the other hand, hand sanitizers containing 60-95% ethanol (or isopropanol) do a pretty good job.

71217,best movies with a cool twist,The guy you responded to must be from Brazil. Everyone knows that i-Carly episode!
19738,best YouTube video,"Please, go to Youtube and search ""Wizard People, Dear Reader."" Narrated by Brad Neely. It's the first harry potter movie, split into 10 minute chapters, with a comedic writer narrating instead of the original script. It is absolutely hilarious, and one of my favorite things to show people. Even if you only watch a single chapter and can't stand it, give it a look."
67433,axios alternatives reddit,"> Uploads are still a work-in-progress, and probably deserving of a stronger warning of it's compat... (Assuming I can get it reliably working)

Ah ok, your comment to someone else suggested that the download snippet you linked to in your article was usable for upload progress too, and I gathered from the links I sourced that it kind of works(at least in Chrome), not sure about Firefox, that seems a bit iffy atm."
72619,best wireless lightweight mouse,"I have all the mice you mentioned with the exception of finalmouse/ Air 58 and you are pretty much spot on about them. My hand size is 20 x10.5 and I prefer the Xtrfy M4 the most followed by the Endgame XM1 v2 and maybe the G703/ G pro Wireless after them.

My least favorite by far is the Razer Viper/ Viper ultimate. To me it's way too flat and very uncomfortable. I was thinking about trying the Finalmouse Capetown but after your review I'll pass on that now."

47321,best state to visit in the United States,Thank you for writing this for me :)
68657,best science fiction novel,"Altered Carbon, Snow Crash, Expanse Series, The Martian and Old Man's War cover a few different areas of the genre, which will help you figure out which (if any) sub genre you prefer.  Those were a couple that stood out in my mind and are generally well received.  Looking at top 100 lists can be kinda overwhelming, so I kept it simple.  Snow Crash is probably the most hit or miss and The Expanse books probably the easiest to enjoy (think action movie in space."
37162,best amusement park,There's never been a time that CP wasn't a clean park.  There was a time that they had more of a focus on guest satisfaction though and not on how many fast passes they could possibly sell in a day.
