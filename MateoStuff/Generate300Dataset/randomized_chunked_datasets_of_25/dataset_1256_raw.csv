Seems like it might be legit."
"Picking between BEAM, CRSP, EDIT, and NTLA feels like a guessing game; I prefer owning a bit of them all because it’s very tough to predict which specific company will make headlines next. 

I must add, however, I don’t find these particularly good “hold forever” stocks. Because they’re volatile, they’re great to buy when cheap, sell for 40-80% profit, and repeat IMO."
"I finally gave in and tried VS Code, and it lived up to the hype in my opinion. So I stuck with it."
"I never flossed. Until I bought [this wonderful device.](https://www.google.com/search?q=waterpik+flosser&hl=en&safe=off&rlz=1C1AVSW_enUS373US373&prmd=imvns&source=univ&tbm=shop&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=w9WTT6qZAtPE2QXx2JGfBQ&ved=0COABEK0E) Now I don't feel guilty about not flossing. Spray water around your mouth for 30 seconds? Piece of cake.

Edit: Also I have a permanent retainer and it's a lifesaver in that regard as well."
Viewsonic 2758-2kp-mhd 1440p 144hz 1ms monitor is what I have and it gives beautiful color with no problems so far. (Also only costs about $300)

"Hi, what is your max budget? Are you looking for a 2-in-1?"
"I did give the links.. just type them in as I listed them. For example, mobilism.me would be www.mobilism.me

The only one that I didn’t provide a link for is the e-book chat on IRCHighway, because that requires downloading an IRC client."
Tupac All Eyes on Me. Double CD album. I haven't read through all the comments but I'm shocked I haven't seen this at the top
"Either strawberry or black raspberry.

Can't go wrong with a high-quality vanilla soft serve, though."

Really good list
I should have clarified that I meant in Test matches.
"Jeez.  On my 21st, people at the bar on the Air Force base I was stuck at just offered to put my drinks, that I chose with no pressure, on their tabs, and invited me to play pool.   I shudder to think what my friends back home would've done to fuck with me, tho..."

Unfortunately you really can’t. But that’s kinda a big part of why most people love leather cases. They love the patina and used up look.
"You're correct. The downside is you have to pay full price for each exclusive on ps. If you have gamepass, all exclusives are available to the subscriber."
"Seasoned drinker/lifter here --> Vodka with Diet Tonic and a squirt of lime juice.  It's cheap on the calories since Diet Tonic has 0 calories, and vodka is a pretty clean, lean spirit.  A little bit of lime juice (fresh squeezed for out of the plastic limes you find at the store) helps to round out the flavor and make it refreshing."

"This is why I'm really scared. Why won't it grow back!? I have minor gum loss from brushing too hard, and now there are gaps between my teeth that were never there before. Now I'm scared to brush my teeth (do it anyway), but trying to floss every day."
