I like how you shortened thousand to k and then spelled out dollar instead of $

"Q: Beside booze what would you want?

A: Booze"
"If you're taking your calc classes in a university also double check if they allow calculators. I know UCF doesn't because of people storing information. Otherwise I just use websites such as desmos, derivitive-calculator, and integral-calculator (sometimes symbolab)."
"The Evening Standard, the ""i"" or The Times IMO"
thanks.

"\*LOL* That's brilliant, the cat growling!

My interactive cat is similar with most visitors, she stalks off outside and performs her magic spells and rituals... after a few hours she usually returns to find they have worked and that the strange humans have gone. Occasionally, the method fails her - she returns, looks somewhat annoyed and slinks off again.

In her heyday, my other cat has literally bitten guests, unprovoked. When she growls it is a serious warning!"
"Repairclinic.com[repairclinic.com](http://www.repairclinic.com)
Parts for everything in your home and garage.  I've used this site to fix my dishwasher, dryer, washing machine, tiller, and mower.  Just search by model # and it will usually give full parts list and diagram."
"I drive between Detroit and Chicago regularly. There are Superchargers on I-94 in Ann Arbor, Marshall, and St. Joseph. St. Joseph Supercharger has a Moe's, a Five Guys, a Froyo place, and a Panera so it's the perfect stop for the 20 minutes you need to get to/from Chicago. 

I have the 264 mile Mid Range RWD Model 3 and it's a breeze to do Detroit-Chicago."
"Three identical strangers...starts off as one thing, and goes somewhere you never imagined it would go. It‚Äôs amazing and absolutely worth a watch."

"The Peninsula, Hong Kong  may not be the best but most certainly it‚Äôs the most elegant."
"I‚Äôm not saying one could not argue the other in the top 5 to be better but the ranking is based on results and Belgium has a lot of good results. 


I dont think other teams ever think about these rankings but other teams are aware of what a good team Belgium is. Weird to say otherwise... We‚Äôve beaten Brazil, England, France, Portugal in recent years. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a coincidence we are top of the rankings and 3rd at the WC"
"Actually, yes you have plenty of options. 

If you want the best sounding closed back wireless headphones without ANC, the $380 (on sale) Drop THX Panda is a great choice. They use planar drivers and have THX's AAA amp technology. It has LDAC for semi-lossless streaming. If you have an iPhone LDAC does not matter, it does not support it. 

If you don't mind open back, the HiFiMan Deva for $300 is an excellent choice. I had the drop wired version, the HE-5XX and they sounded awesome except for a slight treble distortion at high volumes. This also has LDAC. 

If you wanted to go cheaper, the AKG K361BT is a good option for about $100-ish. It does not have LDAC. 

If you needed ANC, one of the best sounding options is the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless for $350 (on sale)."
Thanks for fielding this question while I slept!

"Jim and Benny are also in my top 3 this year so far. The Fraud Department just feels so smooth all the way through. From Jones' rapping and Frauds prod, just a real standout project"

"I live near Niagara Falls NY and unfortunately this is a true fact. Before the modern era it was a really popular spot for travelers to take their lives and the only evidence that it happened were abandoned cars (and carriages as it was a really popular suicide site in the late 1800s)

It's a horrible way to go (you drown at the Horseshoe Falls or you get bashed against rocks at the American Falls) and an unknown but likely large percentage of bodies are never recovered.  Back in pre- Border Patrol days people used to jump off the Rainbow Bridge that connects the US & Canada and either die from the impact with the Niagara River or were swept into the Rapids and Whirlpool to drown. 

It's always sad to hear of someone going missing because of the possibility of suicide and just a couple weeks ago it happened with a young college student from NYC who did it over a breakup. They only know it happened because the police dogs traced her right to the waters edge. I only wish someone had seen her and could have persuaded her not to do it, especially when she had so much life left to live and no relationship is worth dying over."
