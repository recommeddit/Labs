I can't pick a 5th it is way too stressful  :|"
Kourtney. Especially in the past seasons. She may be a bitch now and all that but I kind of understand her wanting to do her own thing and focus more on her kids.
"to get several years out of iPhones, I believe you’ll have to get a battery replaced at some point. There are places that do it, and online sellers with kits. Probably easier to have someone else do it. Also you’ll need to figure out how to maximize that battery life. GL"
"I'm currently painting the interior of her home for her. Some dude scammed her by charging $3000 to do the lounge/dining room/kitchen, and he did an abysmal job. She works with his partner though, so she won't say anything. I said to her fuck it, let me do it; I'll buy the paint and all that, let it be your christmas present. I'm onto the hallway now and she's absolutely thrilled with the change in how it looks (it was a really dirty looking cream colour, and is now just plain white)."
I get super spotty reception in the east bay
"I used to fly often enough with tripods that looked like pipe bombs and technical-looking bags full of wires. The TSA agents and I would write notes to each other on the large cards, and it got to be a running gag. I tried to start up a game of hangman with them, but couldn't get them interested."
"Go to your state’s Agricultural Extension Service website and search on native trees. Read about the characteristics of trees that interest you. Pay attention to mature size, maintenance requirements and anything that might be a negative. For example, drops a lot of plant material throughout the year or has a lot of cones.  Look at images of the trees you are interested in online - you want something that is visually appealing. Where in your yard you plan to plant may make a difference ti your choice. There are some trees that give off chemicals that prevent other plants from thriving. Black walnut for example. Also, are you planting it to help shade your roof in summer and reduce your cooling costs?"
Oki doki I’ll look :)
"So if I am already a Verizon customer, can I switch to this?  Can I keep my same phone number?"
"Also, the Pictured Rocks in the UP."
Reading this thread while hungry was a poor choice.
If they had shown the other universe it would've been a truth then. They left it for us to interpret. Nora needed closure just like you do. But none of you got it.
"Taste? Black Cherry Vanilla by Bang. Even though I don't drink energy drinks anymore, it is still my favorite"
It’s back!! We just repackaged it and you can purchase it now online and in stores. It came back this month ☺️
"Because Apple didn’t want to sell the iPhone 5 for $100 with 2 year contract with the same exact design as the new 5S. 

Ditching the aluminum for plastic saved them about $26/phone. Everything else from the board to the cameras is almost the same as the 5. 

If Apple had kept selling the original iPhone 5 they would’ve sold far fewer 5Ss.

But I do agree!
"Sleep headphones Bluetooth headset. Less than $30. https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07QLF7WHZ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_Q0QNFBY2D5CE5KAA6NKW

I use them all the time. They are super comfortable. I can listen to podcasts to drift away to sleep without disturbing my husband, and I can wear this to listen to music on my walks. Very comfortable and I love it. I wore it all day today."
"Definitley Halo, and the xbox controller. Theyre very nostalgic to me."
"Depending on the included magazines, I'll buy one every sunday."
"Free games - Puzzles and Dragons, exemplifies the example of free, fair, skill based and deep In content

Paid - I like games I can start and stop quickly. Slay the Spire is that. Crying Suns another example. 

Portrait games are also special to me - Solitairica is cheap and has a lot of replay value. 

Civ VI, 9th Dawn III, dead cells, baba is you all quality mobile gaming."
I wonder if celebrities are reading this trying to find their name in the comments
I loved every crazy minute of that movie.
Why not just shower in boiling water then you could take the eggs into the shower with you and save both time and energy?
"It works fine for files that have been uploaded to Drive, but if it was created in Docs, it only downloads as PDF. I'm not the only one experiencing this."
Awesome list
