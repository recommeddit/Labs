> I'm not really sure why you're trying to create new Promises from within a Promise or trying to parse JSON from text

There are really good reasons why I'm doing this and even with comments, you say you didn't get it. This just proves my point, it's not trivial. (the stack overflow questions are just to show that there are a lot of people confused with the `fetch` API, I didn't mean to imply the answers are right for every use-cases)

Your simple code is missing a lot and is far from the convenience of a request libs.

- it fails to parse successful requests with an empty response content,
- it fails to parse JSON error messages (common with any API) which are different than network errors,
- It fails if the error response is empty and you won't know what the cause of the failure is since you're only getting the JSON parse error.

What my snippet does:

- Parses all error types with a safety net, both HTTP errors' body and all other errors
- [Parses empty requests](https://github.com/github/fetch/issues/268#issuecomment-176544728)

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying `fetch` shouldn't be used or whatnot, I use `fetch` on a daily basis and I used Axios, `jQuery.ajax` and even tinkered with raw XMLHttpRequests in the past. My code snippet is not perfect, it's missing a lot of features and edge cases, it's just a quick example. When dealing with third party APIs on huge frontend applications, the simple `if (response.ok)` becomes insufficient rather quickly.

My point is: `fetch` is less trivial than a request lib and is really not a replacement for one, it's a replacement for XHR."
28397,best breakfast foods,"I wish I'd found out about homemade frozen breakfast burritos earlier. You can toss in whatever you want - I like eggs, onions, red peppers, spinach, cheese, and potato - and they're good as hell reheated. When I did my first batch I wasn't convinced the egg would reheat well but I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. Now I cook two huge breakfasts a month and have a delicious breakfast burrito every day! Pro tip: freeze on a cookie sheet, THEN wrap in foil, and they won't be soggy when reheated."

33291,best electric car,"I do not think most will be buying the base model with the little battery but will opt for one of the higher priced models, so by the time the dealer gets some of that $12.5K government tax rebate by increasing the price a couple thousand, most buyers will be \~$60K. Now there will be a lot of people standing in line for this truck and they will probably have an ICE F-150 to trade in which will drop in price (the dealer does not want an item he cannot sell) since you can buy the Lightning for less $$ than a used ICE F-150. So the buyer will lose $$ on their trade in and the dealer will mark up the price because of the govt rebate.No legacy car manufacturer has proven they can mass produce an EV and all will be battery constrained. Who of the 700K buyers of the F-150 are going to want to buy a new ICE F-150 in 2022 when you can buy the EV F-150 for less money. Ford certainly cannot manufacture 60K a month of the Lightning in 2022 or 2023. Also in late 2022 and at least by the first Q of 2023 Tesla will have two plants that begin production and one plant will be building the Cybertruck. Tesla could potentially build 150K or more in 2023."
