57189,best water brand,"Pure water is always pH 7. The farther away you get from 7, the less pure it is. But water being less pure doesn't make it worse. I mean orange juice isn't pure water but people like it.

Hard vs. soft water refers to the amount of dissolved minerals in the water, which are present as ions. The more ions, the harder the water is. Hard water leaves hard water deposits, so IMO it is not desirable for cooking of cleaning. Soft water leaves a soapy feeling on your hands when you wash your hands. Very hard water may have a noticeable taste and water hardness in general can affect suitability for use in aquariums. In general hard water has a higher chance of leaving gross deposits for example in showers, on faucets, or in your water heater, but other than that there isn't much to say about it.

In most parts of most first world countries, if the government said the tap water is OK to drink, it's probably OK to drink. Some water might be slightly better for you or worse for you but there really just isn't enough research about this. You may feel uncomfortable drinking certain types of water with higher levels of contaminants or you may simply not like the taste of your tap water; if that's the case, you can consider a home reverse osmosis system. In multiple stages, it removes non-ionic contaminants (i.e. those that do not contribute to water hardness), then ionic contaminants (i.e. those that do contribute to water hardness). IMO Brita and similar devices are just shitter versions of the same thing; they seem incredibly wasteful, so I don't use those anymore. Of course, a reverse osmosis system will remove fluoride if it's present in your water, so make sure you brush your teeth well in that case."

16643,best pet for toddlers,"No no no. 


Hermit crabs are animals that require extreme care and are not fun at all to own. They pinch hard, they require heat and precise humidity to be able to breathe properly, they cannibalize themselves, and many don't like to be held. They can live for decades. These are TERRIBLE pets not only for toddlers, but for most people. 


Not only that, but to accurately care for hermit crabs, you're going to need at least a 20 gallon tank for two of them (and you should have much more, they're social animals), at least six inches of eco earth for them to bury themselves in, you'll have to mist the cage multiple times a day so they can breathe. They need two different types of water -- fresh and salt. You can't use tap water, it will kill them, and you need specific salt to make the salt water. They need to be fed a varied diet. They also mostly burrow -- you're child will rarely see them. They also molt at least once a year...you'll need to have separate enclosures for when it happens, or they eat each other.
 If you don't do these things, you'll have miserable crabs that are slowly suffocating to death (they have gills...they breathe in the moisture). 


My mom got hermit crabs for me when I was younger. They were no fun and seemed sad. When I started googling how to care for them, I felt absolutely guilty and horrible. These animals were sad and suffering, all because the amount of care they needed was too much. I now own them as adults, but they're very boring animals honestly. Your child will probably lose interest within a few days. 


Please do not get hermit crabs."
7602,best laptop for general use,"Looking for a laptop mainly for creative purposes, writing mainly. But would also like the ability to play some low demand games. I have been pondering a Mac Book Pro or waiting to see what the new one they are bringing out is but would love a recommendation as I would like whatever is best. No budget. Thank you in advance"

64423,Best Nike running shoes,I have found nothing more confusing than the Nike line of shoes.  This was VERY helpful.  Thanks!
52891,best hiphop album,"* Nas - Illmatic
* Jay-Z - The Dynasty (why is this hated?  What songs are wack?  What beats are trash... Street Is Talking, Stick to the Script, Soon You'll Understand, Where Have You Been is like the most introspective shit Jay-Z did until 4:44, 1-900-Hustler, This Can't Be Life... this album is like 100% fire)
* Notorious BIG - Ready to Die
* Puff Daddy - No Way Out (if Dr. Dre counts and he don't write shit that he raps, Diddy should count too imo.  Plus the album is fire.  Beats are crazy... it's like east coast Chronic to me.
* Dr. Dre - The Chronic
* Kanye West - Late Registration.  I hate College Dropout because of the horrific mixing, monotonous production, and Kanye kinda being a trash can quality rapper at the time but I thought he stepped it up a ton on this.  Beats had variety and his raps got way better.  Him rapping wasn't the worst aspect of the songs anymore.
* DMX - It's Dark and Hell Is Hot

I don't really like a lot of albums like that.  I can name 10 albums I like but ""Top 10""... like I can't put a CD with 14 songs, 8 are doo doo or I always skip them when they come up.  It's very hard for me to find an album where I like 50% of the song.  Even outside of hip-hop and just music in general... there's maybe like 12 albums where I like at least 50% of the songs on it."
