25747,"Negative stereotypes:

SA: Chokers, overly conservative, only guy who can actually spin the ball had to be imported.

Oz: Sledgers, simple-minded. Not one decent commentator in the whole country.

India: No fast bowlers, cannot handle short pitched bowling, travel badly.

Pakistan: Crazier than a bag full of snakes. Ageless, but not in the normal sense. Prone to imploding like a dying star.

Windies: Used to be good, now a one-man team. Horrible board that hates their own team.

England: English (admittedly only up to a point). Prone to massively overestimating how good they are. Middle order collapses if Mitchell Johnson so much as looks at it. Hates innovation, creativity and fun.

Sri Lanka: Three man team. Two of those are retiring soon.

Nieu-Seeland: Not the All Blacks. Last good player was in the 80's.

Bangladesh: Have been three years away from being good for ten years now.

Zim: Most recognisable player is a commentator.",best cricket teams of all time

65666,"I can attest for a fact that Downtown Glendale is a weird ass dead spot for Verizon. Three phones and working there for four years I would get no service in my office, and not any bars until I got down to Brand and Doran. 

Everyone in my office with other carriers actually had service to work with, I was the only one that sat with a dead phone for my 8 hours. Very annoying.",best phone service company

34612,"Yeah that's a fair statement, but also it's inherently an unfair comparison because positions in football aren't on an even playing field--QB is undoubtedly more important, and Tom is the best QB. 

It's splitting hairs, sure--Jerry Rice was #1 and now #3 for a reason--but great QB play elevates a team way more than great WR play, and I don't think that can be ignored as well.",best NFL player
27020,"I mean, **Wingspan** is a fairly light short playing game with a good degree of randomness - it isn't a bad game, but I don't think it is a great game; just average and far too light for my tastes.  Out of the whole game, I like it is one of the few where workers are reduced as you play (similar to tying up cubes in **Historia**).

As to ""experts"" - what ""experts""?  These are just people who chose to make a living at reviewing boardgames (or a hobby of it at least); I don't think there is any formal training or experience that would qualify them as experts, but they are more knowledgeable than the average person in the breadth of field study.  I don't mean to downplay their skill, but expert for me feels like a rather strong term.",best board games

Honestly, if Dolphin didn't have so many dependencies, I'd use it in Gnome. Nautilus is such a crappy, barebones file manager.",best terminal file manager reddit
68098,"The usual suspects:

**Neal Stephenson - Anathem** Unique, epic. Loved the monasteries.

**Peter Watts - Blindsight** Like watching Alien for the first time.

**Richard K. Morgan - Altered Carbon** Such an entertaining rush.
 
**Frank Herbert - Dune** I think it is SF. Intriguing ideas about transcending human nature, and great worldbuilding.

**Olaf Stapledon - Star Maker** Eloquent and enormous amount of vision.",best science fiction novel
