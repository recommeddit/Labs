25747,best cricket teams of all time,"Negative stereotypes:

SA: Chokers, overly conservative, only guy who can actually spin the ball had to be imported.

Oz: Sledgers, simple-minded. Not one decent commentator in the whole country.

India: No fast bowlers, cannot handle short pitched bowling, travel badly.

Pakistan: Crazier than a bag full of snakes. Ageless, but not in the normal sense. Prone to imploding like a dying star.

Windies: Used to be good, now a one-man team. Horrible board that hates their own team.

England: English (admittedly only up to a point). Prone to massively overestimating how good they are. Middle order collapses if Mitchell Johnson so much as looks at it. Hates innovation, creativity and fun.

Sri Lanka: Three man team. Two of those are retiring soon.

Nieu-Seeland: Not the All Blacks. Last good player was in the 80's.

Bangladesh: Have been three years away from being good for ten years now.

Zim: Most recognisable player is a commentator."
51853,best iphone case,kind of a waste of money. once the iphones body changes again and with the cameras. all these cases will be useless
65666,best phone service company,"I can attest for a fact that Downtown Glendale is a weird ass dead spot for Verizon. Three phones and working there for four years I would get no service in my office, and not any bars until I got down to Brand and Doran. 

Everyone in my office with other carriers actually had service to work with, I was the only one that sat with a dead phone for my 8 hours. Very annoying."
25229,best spiderman actor,"Tom Holland 100%. Maguire and Garfield were good, but they weren't fully realized. Maguire had the nerdy Peter Parker side down, Garfield had the cocky Spiderman side down, Tom Holland gets both."
44201,best items under $100,PERIOD DOT COM
37264,best amusement park,That could be because Detroit is closer to Cedar Point than Michigan's Adventure.
69389,best major to study in college,Imperialmarch.wav
48133,best color to paint with,I just now figured out why it's called red light district.
44242,best items under $100,I gained ten pounds just reading this thread.
34612,best NFL player,"Yeah that's a fair statement, but also it's inherently an unfair comparison because positions in football aren't on an even playing field--QB is undoubtedly more important, and Tom is the best QB. 

It's splitting hairs, sure--Jerry Rice was #1 and now #3 for a reason--but great QB play elevates a team way more than great WR play, and I don't think that can be ignored as well."
27020,best board games,"I mean, **Wingspan** is a fairly light short playing game with a good degree of randomness - it isn't a bad game, but I don't think it is a great game; just average and far too light for my tastes.  Out of the whole game, I like it is one of the few where workers are reduced as you play (similar to tying up cubes in **Historia**).

As to ""experts"" - what ""experts""?  These are just people who chose to make a living at reviewing boardgames (or a hobby of it at least); I don't think there is any formal training or experience that would qualify them as experts, but they are more knowledgeable than the average person in the breadth of field study.  I don't mean to downplay their skill, but expert for me feels like a rather strong term."
42847,best detective show,Nooooooo whatttt??
55661,best action and adventure novel series,I thought the Expanse Series had a lot of action.
68350,best science fiction novel,"It's very fantasy-influenced compared to a lot of these other novels. It's set in the future but the science take a very big back seat to the fiction.

That being said Hyperion Cantos is one of my all time favorite series and Dan Simmons is an exquisite writer."
15494,best tree for the garden,Looking at the picture i think service berry is a great option. I suggest one of the more narrow tree form like cumulus or Robinhill. I think Japanese maple would look alright with small shrubs around it. Another option would be a flowering dogwood such as venus.
260,best terminal file manager reddit,"Funny, I use Nautilus, and wish it sorted hidden folders at the top like Dolphin does. I also wish Nautilus had those little check-mark boxes for (de)selecting folders.

Honestly, if Dolphin didn't have so many dependencies, I'd use it in Gnome. Nautilus is such a crappy, barebones file manager."
68098,best science fiction novel,"The usual suspects:

**Neal Stephenson - Anathem** Unique, epic. Loved the monasteries.

**Peter Watts - Blindsight** Like watching Alien for the first time.

**Richard K. Morgan - Altered Carbon** Such an entertaining rush.
 
**Frank Herbert - Dune** I think it is SF. Intriguing ideas about transcending human nature, and great worldbuilding.

**Olaf Stapledon - Star Maker** Eloquent and enormous amount of vision."
19153,best YouTube video,[a seal slapping his belly](https://youtu.be/gGl2IbhyKIc)
73846,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Here’s the one I got, looking at it now it’s got some mixed reviews: www.amazon.ca/dp/B08MCGCWXV/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_FT34CWFS2DF4M27878NR?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
56955,best water brand,Ice Mountain. Hands down my favorite.
3289,best webcamera,"I maybe don't read the subreddit enough then :)

But the advice to ""hey I'm about to do my first stream, what gear do I need?"", the answer is: ""a headset, or a microphone+headphones if you want to talk with chat."", don't even NEED a camera."
72493,best keyboard switches,I can understand why people may not like Romer-Gs but I absolutely love them for gaming. Near perfect weight and just enough tactility.
47189,best state to visit in the United States,Nashville is much better than Memphis.
35269,best alcoholic drink,"Rum goes with anything:  
Rum and coke  
Rum and creaming soda  
Rum and doctor pepper  
Rum and orange juice  
Rum and cordial    
Rum and rum (my personal favorite)  
Rum just makes everything better..."
23302,best car racing video game,Project cars is a little too arcadey to some but I really like it. It's one of the better games for getting together with friends to race online without needing a crazy amount of experience to make the racing fun.
