64757,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Lots of good food in SB so you really can't go wrong. Definitely go to Los Agaves. Lama Dog in the Funk Zone for craft beer, good food, great environment. Arigato is legit sushi but yeah, pricey. Yume Sushi is also downtown and has equally phenomenal sushi without the price tag and long lines. Olio E Limone and Olio Pizzeria are both fantastic. Bouchon is probably the best restaurant in town, but pricey. Ca Dario is a bomb Italian restaurant for less than Olio."

62867,Best Data Science textbook,"A bit different from the rest, but I really like Dataclysm by Christian Rudder and The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Tufte. 

The first is a great example of presenting data well to an audience not familiar with the subject matter and the second is a great help when designing visualizations."
63383,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"As someone who’s horrible at making their own decisions, this definetly helps, thanks man 😭🤞🏽"
71972,best movies with a cool twist,"Imagine being a kid or a moviegoer that had no real idea about the comics or much about thanos or infinity war beyond it being an avengers movie. That twist is hella shocking then isn’t it! 

For this generation of kids this is their mufasa moment, the toys in the garbage disposal moment, their ash ketchum dying moment. This shit is traumatising in the best way!"

18106,best Kardashian,What the hell?! Yikes that's just.. That's super gross lmao. Did she pick it up? Was it an accident?
68244,best science fiction novel,"This is probably my current/recent top 5:

* **2312** by Kim Stanley Robinson: rambly, ambitious, and with lots of flowery descriptions of nature, 2312 was the book that got me back into sci-fi big time after a long period of not being able to finish a book.
* **Habitat** by Simon Roy: a short graphic novel about a collapsed civilization in a satellite colony going to war over a single 3D printed laser gun. A must-read for sci-fi fans.
* **Frankenstein** by Mary Shelley: Victor Frankenstein is the most relatable college art student in all of fiction. The first and most famous science fiction novel, yet its still somehow underrated.
* **Draco Tavern** by Larry Niven: Niven is an old favorite who I've sort outgrown, but Draco Tavern is a fun collection where he leans heavily on his greatest strength, writing tons of wacky aliens.
* **The Word for World is Forest** by Ursula Le Guin: Le Guin's post-Vietnam anti-war novella where she invents Ewoks 10 years early and rages against libertarian army bros is just as cathartic and necessary all these years later."
63582,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Yeah your right. I do have an attachment with Cydia. And whatever the case I won’t let go of Cydia. But I do keep sileo and would also keep zebra with it. Is it possible to keep all 3 of em though.
