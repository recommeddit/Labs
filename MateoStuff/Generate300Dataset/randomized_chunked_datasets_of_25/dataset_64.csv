64757,"Lots of good food in SB so you really can't go wrong. Definitely go to Los Agaves. Lama Dog in the Funk Zone for craft beer, good food, great environment. Arigato is legit sushi but yeah, pricey. Yume Sushi is also downtown and has equally phenomenal sushi without the price tag and long lines. Olio E Limone and Olio Pizzeria are both fantastic. Bouchon is probably the best restaurant in town, but pricey. Ca Dario is a bomb Italian restaurant for less than Olio.",best places to eat in Santa Barbara

68244,"This is probably my current/recent top 5:

* **2312** by Kim Stanley Robinson: rambly, ambitious, and with lots of flowery descriptions of nature, 2312 was the book that got me back into sci-fi big time after a long period of not being able to finish a book.
* **Habitat** by Simon Roy: a short graphic novel about a collapsed civilization in a satellite colony going to war over a single 3D printed laser gun. A must-read for sci-fi fans.
* **Frankenstein** by Mary Shelley: Victor Frankenstein is the most relatable college art student in all of fiction. The first and most famous science fiction novel, yet its still somehow underrated.
* **Draco Tavern** by Larry Niven: Niven is an old favorite who I've sort outgrown, but Draco Tavern is a fun collection where he leans heavily on his greatest strength, writing tons of wacky aliens.
* **The Word for World is Forest** by Ursula Le Guin: Le Guin's post-Vietnam anti-war novella where she invents Ewoks 10 years early and rages against libertarian army bros is just as cathartic and necessary all these years later.",best science fiction novel
