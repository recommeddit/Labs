Bayern Munich seems to be a top pick in Germany.
Thanks for the suggestion. I just checked it out and while it is a nice app it isn’t exactly the calendar hybrid I’m looking for. Yes you CAN view it in iCal but it is focused on a daily/weekly todo. I schedule things months in advance and this doesn’t have a built in calendar. So this would be a lot like just switching from Trello but not combining anything. Thank you though!

"Hi, I would wait to see if either of the Gateway laptops in the $400 to $499 budget range drop down to $399 again. That would be your best bang for buck. Otherwise, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15"" in the $300 to $399 range is a good choice. Having more RAM would be useful for multitasking, but the IdeaPad 3 15"" is still capable for your uses."

"Yes, meant Maui! Corona is def messing up everybody’s travel plans :-(

Def recommend making it a tradition....it’s amazing for kids! Best pools of any resort I’ve been to except maybe Atlantis."
"Ok, mom."
"Im on my mobile so can't really look it up, but look for pregnancy cookie dough. It does not have eggs in it, so you can't cook it to make cookies but it tastes like cookies.

I make mine and then roll them in to 2-3 cm balls. Freeze them on a cookie tray for about an hour at least before dropping them into the ice cream.

Hope that helps."
That's how you know it's working!
He sounds like a middle aged white dad rapping what he thinks rap sounds like
Pricey but cutler and gross.

Powerful ending. I wonder why they didn’t show the Dad that tried to attack him court. I thought for sure that would be on there and then it wasn’t.
I read it in their voices... It makes it worse.

We touched it during 6th grade but it was basically nonexistent. Just a bit about the Alamo. I think that most Americans (outside of Texas/parts of the south) wouldn't be able to give you too many details about it.

"Wow. I can't thank you enough for the tips and advises. They are all great and will definitely help me on my path to Web Development. Especially the DB part.

There are tons of information out there and how to use them. The following list are the this things I read regarding to WEB that I can't really understand: 

* JSON, AJAX, DOM;
* UX/UI - I have been following The Futur, and they are really great. I want  to have a little background on those aspects while I am still learning PHP and do mostly CRUD. And as I want to work as a freelancer to gather a small amount money, I realized most of the small clients only want a fancy/creative page with basic CRUD; 
* REST;
* MVC (My teacher introduced - sort of - us to GRAILS. At first it is frustrating but seeing now, it solves a major problem that my project has: multiples static pages with PHP on it, that will be a pain when adding new features; and also, I want to be able to replicate MVC on HTML/PHP);
* Angular, React, Vue.

And at the end of the year I will ask someone (reddit perhaps) to check my code and give opinions or critics on the aspects I need to improve (especially about the code readability)."
"I will also bring up another team that i absolutely loved watching. The problem is that they managed to give away a 3-0 lead in a CL final.

Dida - Cafu, Nesta, Stam, Maldini - Pirlo, Seedorf, Gattuso, Kaka - Crespo, Sjevtsjenko

They used to play with a diamond on the midfield, as far as i remember. I think every player on this team was absolutely world class."
"Sopranos blew my mind as a teenager. Got the first four seasons on DVD about 8 months before season 5 started. Me and my best friend got obsessed lol, talked about it all the time. Loved that shit. By the time I got to college, had passed that DVD set around to every muthafucka I knew. So that season 6A and 6B, we would all congregate somewhere and watch each episode. It was like an event, like getting to watch your team in the playoffs. Never had a TV experience quite like that since. 

But I will always love that show and watch it every couple of years. It’s therapeutic, actually. And gets funnier and deeper with each rewatch. You don’t wanna get me started on that final season or scene lol. Will always be my favorite show, sentimental value, but it’s just brilliant.

True Detective somehow became just like that over recent years. The other two are good TV but Season 1, the setting and McConoughay’s Rust Cohle, it’s on a different level. I just love that character and relate to him so much. Feel like I’ve learned so much from him, and I’m not talking about on any philosophical level. Because his philosophy, to me, is just a defense mechanism.

I know I’ve read somewhere that NP said Sopranos was a huge influence and showed him the true potential of television. I like to think that’s where the idea for the season first took shape. “I need something like the Dr Melfi sessions on Sopranos. A kind of Greek chorus that will allow us to get into the mind of the main character, but he is also lying through much of it, sonthe audiende has to make their own interpretation.... how about an interrogation/interview!” And it just took off from there.

OP, if you haven’t seen The Wire, that shit is incredible storytelling, on a different level. 

I’d put Sopranos, The Wire, and TD S1 on my top tier, with Breaking Bad slightly below"

"Not the same person as u/raevnos. I just happen to also use pure 99% CLI commands for my file-management needs, like raevnos mentions.

I've been using the CLI for ~30yrs now (Apple ][ DOS3.3/ProDOS, MS-DOS, then Unix/Ultrix, some time with RedHat/Mandrake & Debian before switching to FreeBSD & OpenBSD), so most of what I need to do is second nature.  Most of my needs fall into one of three categories:

- **small:** Usually a couple files at play, so I can do them directly at the command-line, often assisted by tab-completion (which understands file-globs in most of the shells I have here)

- **large & automatable:** lots of files but a simple transformation. Sometimes they're easily identified by a filename glob, sometimes some other attribute (file size, mtime, some property that can be extracted from the file by a utility like `identify` or `file`, etc), or using `rename` to slice & dice filenames. The breadth of CLI tools can make this pretty easy (a lot of `find`, `xargs`, `rename`, `sed`/`awk`, etc here).

- **large & bespoke:** Here's where I usually use some means to generate a file list (`ls`, `find`, log-files, etc), pipe them into an editor, then use that to produce the desired commands"

I finished season 1 of Broadchurch because a lot of people say it’s a good crime mystery show but what was that??? What exactly did he do?? He didn’t solve anything AT ALL
