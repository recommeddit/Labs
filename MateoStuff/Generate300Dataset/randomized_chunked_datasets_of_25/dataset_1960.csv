73419,"I find that the weight-reward/convenience ratio for big powerbanks are quite poor. My setup is MacBook pro 15inch, iPad Pro 12,9 inch and an iPhone X. All of them have fantastic battery life and:


1. I rarely work from spots without power for a longer amount of time than the battery cycles of my devices.

2. There is no flight time on the planet that my iPad’s battery can’t outlast when watching a realistic amount of movies.

2. Half a KG is excessive for a ""what-if"" item.


Perhaps a tiny powerbank for a 1-iPhone charge wouldn’t be bad of an investment to have for those rare occasions when you get to a new country and realize you don’t have enough battery to find your Airbnb because you’ve been using your phone to listen to podcasts all day.

No real world scenario has ever left me thinking ""damn, should have brought a 20.000+ mah power bank...""



I invested in a good charging station instead that fast charge all my devices and has a cable extension. I love it. It’s the Hyper Juice 87 watt with dual usb c PD and a single usb a 18w.",best battery bank
