Glad people have a ton of options in here. I would love a Phone Rebel case but so far haven’t seen anything for the 13 pro max",best iphone case

• Atelier Cologne ""Cedrat Enivrant Cologne Absolue""

• English Laundry ""Cambridge Knight""

As for my personal favorite, do yourself a favor and test out Mont Blanc ""Legend"" and Dolce & Gabbana ""Pour Homme.""",best cologne
53824,"When you feel it coming on, load up on vitamin C, pills, oranges, orange juice. Get it in your body. 3-4 times a day.

* Keep warm even if you feel uncomfortable, heat will help.

* Sleep without distraction. Don't go to bed with your laptop or phone, put on a bit of music if you need to but concentrate on relaxing and just sleep.

* Drink water, tons of it. It'll flush out whatever is in your body and help with digestion, headaches, sinus pain, and increase your metabolism so your body can fight what ever is messing you up.

* When blowing your nose cover one nostril at a time and alternate. You'll reduce the chances of getting that weird feeling when you pop your ears.

* And if all else fails cold FX, I haven't personally tried it but it's gotten great reviews in my family.",best medicine for a cold

54584,"I currently have a zero XL in soft and love it for aim focused games like valorant but find it harder for fast games like warzone/cod where I need fast movements or in apex when tracking (feels harder to target transition) and time to kill takes longer. I was thinking of trying the hien XL in soft next in hopes of finding one mousepad to do it all (valorant aim focused, apex tracking, cod fast paced, etc). 

Do you think the hien would be a good fit for my needs (or would say the Hayate Otsu V2 be better)? I bought my zero off amazon and it seemed legit to me and was wondering what your thoughts were on getting it off a 3rd party seller on amazon.

Thanks!",best artisan mousepad alternatives

23135,"You don't need to LIKE social networking, but you most certainly should learn to utilize it.  How do you plan on networking, or finding professional connections without using social media?  Linked in is hugely important, you can find friends who know people at companies to kind of give you a leg up at an interview.  Facebook is good to have if friends know about jobs that aren't publicly available.  Twitter can be useful, but I never use it and haven't had any problems from not using it.

I guess my point is that you don't need to like social media to learn how to utilize it to your benefit, and in my opinion you would be missing out greatly by not using it to your advantage.",best social networking site for CS

Not gray beige or grey white. All of my big room areas and tall areas are gray and [hallways.A](https://hallways.AI) I used large bright pictures and [artwork to add color](https://i.imgur.com/eDJ7BEm.png) and interest. The kitchen is cream and the dining room and [library are brightly colored](https://i.imgur.com/zNBMDvh.png) as they are large rooms with lots of windows. Bedrooms are all colorful as are the bathrooms.  Main floor bathroom I went with wainscotting and cream with bright  murals.
