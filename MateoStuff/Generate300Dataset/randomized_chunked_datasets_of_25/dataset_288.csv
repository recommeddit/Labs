51395,best iphone case,"After the horrible experience I had with iPhone 12 cases from apple (both leather and silicone and clear) I’ll stay away from them for a while. Either corners breaking, case falling of my phone on the corners because of no lip, etc etc. 

Glad people have a ton of options in here. I would love a Phone Rebel case but so far haven’t seen anything for the 13 pro max"

58843,best cologne,"Try signing up for Birchbox. It'll get you lots of fashion based product to test out, including oddly well-chosen colognes. I've received two from them so far that are absolutely fucking bomb:

• Atelier Cologne ""Cedrat Enivrant Cologne Absolue""

• English Laundry ""Cambridge Knight""

As for my personal favorite, do yourself a favor and test out Mont Blanc ""Legend"" and Dolce & Gabbana ""Pour Homme."""
53824,best medicine for a cold,"When you feel it coming on, load up on vitamin C, pills, oranges, orange juice. Get it in your body. 3-4 times a day.

* Keep warm even if you feel uncomfortable, heat will help.

* Sleep without distraction. Don't go to bed with your laptop or phone, put on a bit of music if you need to but concentrate on relaxing and just sleep.

* Drink water, tons of it. It'll flush out whatever is in your body and help with digestion, headaches, sinus pain, and increase your metabolism so your body can fight what ever is messing you up.

* When blowing your nose cover one nostril at a time and alternate. You'll reduce the chances of getting that weird feeling when you pop your ears.

* And if all else fails cold FX, I haven't personally tried it but it's gotten great reviews in my family."

54584,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I currently have a zero XL in soft and love it for aim focused games like valorant but find it harder for fast games like warzone/cod where I need fast movements or in apex when tracking (feels harder to target transition) and time to kill takes longer. I was thinking of trying the hien XL in soft next in hopes of finding one mousepad to do it all (valorant aim focused, apex tracking, cod fast paced, etc). 

Do you think the hien would be a good fit for my needs (or would say the Hayate Otsu V2 be better)? I bought my zero off amazon and it seemed legit to me and was wondering what your thoughts were on getting it off a 3rd party seller on amazon.

Thanks!"
60969,Best comedy show on Netflix,I personally love The Inbetweeners.
23135,best social networking site for CS,"You don't need to LIKE social networking, but you most certainly should learn to utilize it.  How do you plan on networking, or finding professional connections without using social media?  Linked in is hugely important, you can find friends who know people at companies to kind of give you a leg up at an interview.  Facebook is good to have if friends know about jobs that aren't publicly available.  Twitter can be useful, but I never use it and haven't had any problems from not using it.

I guess my point is that you don't need to like social media to learn how to utilize it to your benefit, and in my opinion you would be missing out greatly by not using it to your advantage."

39127,best web browser,"I like using Brave, I have an low end notebook and Brave was the one that worked for me the best. I tried using firefox and chrome, but in my current system is just impossible. I don't trust Opera, there's a lot of privacy concerns.

 The other thing good about Brave, is that this browser is based on chromium, so basically any extension that you would find on chrome works on Brave as well."
21033,best workout music,"Some great albums here. I'd add:

* Belvedere - Fast Forward Eats the Tape
* This is a Standoff - Be Excited

Some other good bands in this vein (melodic hardcore and/or upbeat punk-y):

* Hero of Our Time
* A Wilhelm Scream
* Latterman
* A Second Plan
* Nothington
* Bear Vs. Shark
* Anchors for Arms
* Strike Anywhere

* Living With Lions

22196,best celebrity,"I was lucky enough to meet Bruce Campbell about 15 years ago at a showing of Army of Darkness. He stayed after the movie for 3-4 hours just hanging out and talking with people. He's really a funny, cool, and modest guy."

68191,best science fiction novel,"I also slightly perfer Count Zero to Neuromancer. I love both but Count Zero seems more ""grand"" in a way while still feeling very personal like Neuromancer. I also love how Gibson vaguely connects the two, the Sprawl feels so lived in."
47959,best color to paint with,"My main house color is grey. I have a two story living room and it was [murder red/orange](https://i.imgur.com/veywOe7.png) when I got it.[I painted it grey](https://i.imgur.com/CsfOkQJ.png) (Behr Silver Bullet) that is a true gray to me. Not gray beige or grey white. All of my big room areas and tall areas are gray and [hallways.A](https://hallways.AI) I used large bright pictures and [artwork to add color](https://i.imgur.com/eDJ7BEm.png) and interest. The kitchen is cream and the dining room and [library are brightly colored](https://i.imgur.com/zNBMDvh.png) as they are large rooms with lots of windows. Bedrooms are all colorful as are the bathrooms.  Main floor bathroom I went with wainscotting and cream with bright  murals.

&#x200B;

I really love the gray. Once I finish repainting all the trim and replacing the trashed flooring the gray acts as to brighten and illuminate but not overpower or offend. I love blues and the gray stops me from painting my entire house blue. I just decorate in it instead."

65488,best phone service company,Tello unlimited data/unlimited mins free text is $39 a month. I wonder if there any deals out there that can trump this? Right now I'm paying $19 for the 4GB data/unlimited mins free text plan because I have wifi at home/work and haven't gone over 2GB of data in almost a year.
