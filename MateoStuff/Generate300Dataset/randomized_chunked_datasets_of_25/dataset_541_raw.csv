"I'm surprise no one has said this yet:

Saw (2004)"
"Yeh agreed, but a cool idea none the less."
That’s a great documentary too.
">  I laugh about that crap thing, and ask if he would like some real merch. ""It *is* real"".

I'm crying, so *thanks!*."
I like McLendon's hardware rather than Home Depot because the staff in each area actually know their stuff and are very helpful even with my terrible descriptions and photos of things. They are also kind and patient. It's like an old school hardware store.
"> A 1"" sensor with a decent readout speed and some relatively fast glass that isn't focus locked to infinity

I've had manual focus webcams and they suck. The depth of field is not wide enough to not look like poop."
Is it possible to find a job from the states ?
Tetris is on iOS though
"Gotta recommend Bloodborne, dark souls series, immortal Phoenix rising, ac origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. And finally little nightmares 1 & 2."
"I’ve lived in Texas and Oregon and will probably be kicked out of Texas for saying this, but Oregon is a million times better. Much better weather and it’s way prettier."
"Country is wonderful, but pretty much don't expect an exciting social life."
"To be fair, if you pay per year, it's $11.66 per month.

Not that that justifies them having a huge security hole in their product..."
Skip the rest of the US and go to California. You could spend a month there and still not see everything
"For ceilings, I like CHB (Chicago Home Builders) from Sherwin-Williams. I believe it's a regional (midwest) product though. Eminence is garbage.

For walls, I like Sherwin-Williams Superpaint in satin. I've also tried and liked Benjamin Moore's Ben. Can't comment on a white color for walls as I've only ever done colors.

For trim, Benjamin Moore Advanced Semi in Simply White. It's a waterborne alkyd paint, so it has the durability and hardness of an oil-based, but cleans up with water. The only downside is the time until recoat is like 16 hours or something ridiculous.

Whatever you do, don't try to get Simply White mixed in a Sherwin-Williams paint. It won't match. I had a gallon of Pro Classic mixed in Simply White, and after the first coat, realized it had a greenish hue to it. When I took it back, the manager at the SW store said the employee shouldn't have mixed it for me because they just can't seem to match Simply White."
"My wife and I have stayed at Riu Palace in both Riviera Maya and Punta Cana. Although both were great, the one in Mexico seemed to be better. 
In each of the rooms there are liquor dispensers filled with tequila, vodka, whisky and gin. The mini fridges are always stocked with beers, waters, and pops for mixers.
Depending on the time of day there is always at least one buffet open (breakfast, lunch and dinner). Then in the evening there are various themed restaurants open. Most are just walk in welcome, but some you need to make a ""reservation"" which is just going to the concierge and telling them you want to eat here tonight.
They also offered free equipment rental on the beach. You can rent snorkels, kayaks, catamarans and I'm sure some other things that we didn't bother with. 
I can't think of anything that wasn't included or costed extra. The one thing that I recalled that was nice is that if you stay at the Palace, you have access to all of the other Riu restaurants for breakfast, lunch and bars. This is really convenient when you want to take a stroll on the beach and you want another drink. You can walk up and get a drink at any of the other Rius."
His wife was also stolen from a TSA checkpoint.
"Europa-Park hands down. The level of details and passion that goes into this park is insane. 

It's also been voted best park in the world for the last 4 years by Golden Ticket."
"Woah there now hol up, that old timer's ""worthless"" candy has every appearance of a Werther's Original hard candy (also available in soft caramel). I happen to have one in my mouth AT THIS VERY MOMENT and can vouch for it's creamy succulent yummy in my tummyness!

You might say it's a generic butterscotch candy. NAY! The wrapper is quite clearly opaque in the middle and partially translucent on the sides, also being oval and referred to as ""worthless"", a clear and undignified jab at this time tested classic.

I will say GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR.

also I really do have one in my mouth rn"
Consoles are expensive and buying games for a console that’ll be obsolete soon isn’t worth it
I mean you can't just give away the entire six pack
Oh I got back and forth on the app to see if it’s cheaper to just go into HD or easier and cheaper to go through Lowes
