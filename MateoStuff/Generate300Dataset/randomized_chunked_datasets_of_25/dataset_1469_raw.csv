">Dreams are:
can you provide who is the director or actor for this movie?"
Living With Yourself is definitely binge-worthy. I watched it all in one go.
"How’s the durability of the otsu v2 vs the zero/hien?

Also, what would you recommend to someone who’s never used an artisan pad? (I’ve only used control pads, mainly the qck heavy and logitech g640). Thinking of buying an artisan real soon"

That's the name of the book by Stephenson. :-)"
Horizon is as much a rpg as Final Fantasy XV.
"Oooh I like your guess! I would say out of the three things you mentioned, you are only correct about one (and a half?) of them."
There are a few places in the US that you can skydive under 18.
"I'm not saying it's not important, but is it really *that* good? I don't really know if I'm qualified to say."
"Colognes are a very personal thing as they smell different on each person. For summer, I really like Aqva by Bvlgari but I can't be sure you'll like it or that it'll smell good on you."
Yah man it’s def top 5 for me and it’s also highly rewatchable
Yes the D&G Light Blue. I put it on my my husband immediately starts burying his head in my neck to smell me. He bought me a huge bottle of it so I could use it frequently.

A second monitor for your computer. It saves so much time and makes work easier.
I should have said mixing in the title.  Ill take this as my fault.
"It's based on data, and thanks to good results from 2015 to 2018 we are still high. Realistically we should be below Sweden, Senegal and Ukraine (they're way better than what their position suggests). Maybe we'll get better under Sousa."
"My Summer Car, if it counts."
"All the dorms around Anacapa (San Nic, San Miguel, Santa Cruz) are pretty similar in terms of location/dining commons, you have the choice between Ortega and De La Guerra bc both are really close, and all those dorms are on campus so its super easy to get to class. 

FT aka Santa Catalina is off campus by about a 10 min bike ride, but it has its own brand new dining commons. Santa Catalina is also just a huge building full of freshmen, so I imagine it would be pretty easy to find friends and I can't see how it wouldn't be a lot of fun. You can't really go wrong imo, since all the dining commons are pretty similar."

"It’s frustrating that Apple doesn’t build this into macOS. I assume for marketing reasons because it implies that the Macbook webcam isn’t good enough, but also the Macbook webcam isn’t good enough."
"There's always the food bank, too. My school had an office where if you needed food or other help, they'd connect you with the right agencies in town to help you. There's no reason to starve when you're going to school. Also, if you're really desperate and can't for some reason go to a food bank, get a job at a buffet.  Workers there eat like fat, carb loading monkeys."
"Exactly. Tobey was way too earnest and wholesome as Spidey/Peter Parker. Garfield was good but those movies were pointless. Also, Holland is the only actual teen playing a teenager, so even better. 

Edit: was* the only teen."
"they are hyped but honestly for some reason. im not gonna lie: the zero is the most perfect pad for me. and i tried ALL. if you want to have the most premium pads, go for artisan. none of the other brands are coming close to this quality."
