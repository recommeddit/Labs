53894,best medicine for a cold,"A ton of people I know swear by using Oil of Wild Oregano when sick. Apparently you just put a few drops under your tongue every hour and bam a few hours later, your cold is gone.

It should be noted that I'm a teacher and have gotten this advice from a number of other teachers and we are exposed to colds all the frigging time.

If the health-store route is not your cup of tea, I recommend Buckley's. It tastes like crap and it works."

2786,best headphones,"I saw your comments on other threads saying that you were contacting audiotechnica about the g1wl dropping out too around 5mo ago.  Is the connection failure a common theme across headsets (due to both having dongles across a 2.4GHz freq) or was there one which was more stable than the other?
That is the first ive heard of the hs70 having connection problems"

It's basically the same tbh. If you count Euros also I'd say is slightly better for Spain."

36234,best alcoholic drink,"Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.

Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V(Oh, that Santragian seawater! Oh, those Santragian fish!)
Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in honor of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qalactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heavy odors of the dark Qalactin Zones, subtle, sweet, and mystic.
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.
Sprinkle Zamphuor.
Add an olive.
Drink . . . but . . . very carefully . . ."

20134,best workout music,"HELL YEAH! I don't lift, or get up at 5:30 (that's some fucking deduction, man, keep at it!), but I do absolutely love ABBA. 

Edit: Shit, I meant ""dedication"". Thank you autocorrect."
33655,best electric car,"Totally agree that an EV wouldn't work for that kind of situation. I do some rural drives where there is no charging and I have to do almost 300 miles on a charge. It's not easy..

But on a normal route with L3 charging, a 9 hour trip becomes a 10:00-10:25 hour trip. So like you said, infrastructure expansion really seems to be the big thing right now, and it seems solvable. On the other hand, I welcome the breaks, so the downtime is no problem."
