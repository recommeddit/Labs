It should be noted that I'm a teacher and have gotten this advice from a number of other teachers and we are exposed to colds all the frigging time.

If the health-store route is not your cup of tea, I recommend Buckley's. It tastes like crap and it works.",best medicine for a cold

But on a normal route with L3 charging, a 9 hour trip becomes a 10:00-10:25 hour trip. So like you said, infrastructure expansion really seems to be the big thing right now, and it seems solvable. On the other hand, I welcome the breaks, so the downtime is no problem.",best electric car
