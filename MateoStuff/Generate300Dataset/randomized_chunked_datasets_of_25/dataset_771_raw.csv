Then why did you use 60k as a cutoff?
"My grandma drank a glass of HOT beer every day and never caught a cold. I pimped it: 1 pint of hot beer (don't boil!), add 2 teaspoons of honey and 2 or 3 drops of mint oil. Drink it slow, but DRINK it. Take 1 aspirin and go to bed. Make sure that there's fresh air in the room you are sleeping in. Wear something that will absorb sweat, because you will be transpiring like a boss (and that's good). If you don't have to work: take 3-4 garlic cloves, mash them. Add honey and (for Heaven's sake, just a drop or two!) tabasco. Swallow it slowly. Garlic is very antibacterial, but will turn you into an unpopular person. Sleep as much as you can. Believe me, I am undergoing that cure right now and feel a lot better than having to take chemical stuff. 

Btw: Grandma was 90 when she passed away in her sleep.

Get well soon."
Does this exclude Disney and Universal parks?
I've used arm and hammer advanced whitening for as long as I can remember (told I have healthy teeth). Is the baking soda in this not considered abrasive?
"There are some things that make NZ a fantastic place to live, or at the very least seem like big selling points e.g:

* Nothing here can kill you - We have no snakes, our spiders can't kill you and most of our native species are birds or bugs.  Even our police are safer because they don't carry guns for normal duty so people are rarely killed by police.
* Public healthcare is actually a really good thing - If you live here and you need hospital level care then you won't pay so there are no big medical debts.
* ACC - if you get injured here, whether you live here or not, you qualify for compensation which covers the cost of treatment, most of the cost of physio, etc.  If you're working here legally and meet a few other criteria then you also get 80% of your pay for work you have to miss.

Things you don't realise until you're living here:

* We are a small market so we get less range of everything and pay more for it.
* Petrol costs more, about 4 times what Americans pay.
* You can't even travel within NZ without taking a flight unless you're staying within one island or you live in Wellington.
* International travel is expensive, especially at times when a lot of people are travelling.  A lot of airlines that fly here have agreements with other airlines as well so you could be on a flight with people who booked through 3 different airlines.
* The only time NZ is mentioned on TV or in movies is as the butt of a joke.

"You are saying that you want to learn to run, maintain and modify the distro as deeply as you can.

Now, for new users I wouldn't normally say this but: ArchLinux. It's fantastic because it's purely a ""DYI"" distro. By setting everything up yourself you'll learn so much.

If you try Arch, the best reading material is the arch wiki. It's brilliant."
"Was a bartender at Applebee's

LIIT prep, 1 gallon of sour mix and one 750ml bottle each. gut rot vodka, tequila, white rum, gin. Fill the glass with ice, pour in mix, top with a splash of coke for color and garnish with lemon if you feel like it and it isn't busy."
Bruh I was doing this between classes. I'll add to it later.
GH is $100 and 20lb…. Don’t know if that was an intentional exaggeration…
Fjallraven Raven is working pretty well for me.
Bridges of Madison County if you're into that.
Depends on your budget
Jackson Hole Wyoming is probably one of the greatest places you will visit. Also south florida where i live.
"Cool, sounds good, have fun!


> Angular, React, Vue.

I've been looking into these lately, and I'm going to go with React for now... seems to already have a heap of libararies that can already replace all the stuff jQuery ones I've used in the past... amazing how quickly they've all come out, and with quite a lot of options/functionality.  I'm also going to use React for both server and client side rendering."
haha. this looks spot on. SFOG is a bucket list park for sure. what was your favorite there?
It's a great series but it jumps back and forth through time which is a bit jarring.
Thanks for letting me know :)
"I have a 32 inch Alienware ultrawide (3440x1440) with g-sync that runs at 120Hz. I like it quite a bit but I honestly wish I'd just opted for a 4K monitor instead - I want more vertical resolution.

If you want the ""best"" gaming monitors, look for ones that do true HDR (i.e. over 1000 nits) with either G-Sync Ultimate or Freesync depending on what card you use, along with 144Hz+

EDIT: I'd suggest the Acer X32 which can run G-Sync Ultimate at 200Hz and has a fantastic color gamut and 1440 nits HDR support. Cost is $3,600 but you said price wasn't a problem. review here"": https://www.cnet.com/news/acers-predator-x32-gaming-monitor-seems-awesome-its-also-3600-ces-2020/"
