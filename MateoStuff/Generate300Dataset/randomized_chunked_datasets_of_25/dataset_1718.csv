- [Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Processing-Synthesis-Lectures-Technologies/dp/1627052984) by Yoav Goldberg (2017). Okay for beginners, but even better as a reference work. I make sure to keep it close at hand.
- [Introduction to Information Retrieval, aka the IR Book](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html) by Christopher Manning (2008). 
- [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438) by Francois Chollet. The first I book I recommend to anyone getting started with deep learning. I've read it cover to cover about three times.
- For programming in Python in general, I also really enjoyed [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008) by Luciano Ramalho (2015), which gave me my first glimpse of just how deep the Python rabbit hole goes.",Best Data Science textbook

23227,">	It’s not possible to target based on race among other things. It’s explicitly against the ads targeting policy and if you had ever created a targeted ad you’d know that. Maybe do some research first?

>	Lobbying to prevent regulation? Did you research this too? What regulation are you talking about? What regulations would you like to see? Why do you think those regulations would make sense and/or are feasible? The only thing I’ve seen from regulation is that nowadays I have to click on accepting cookies for every website.

That’s the point. There hasn’t been regulation because politicians are using the platforms for self-gain in their pursuit of reelection. Europe started GDPR around 3-4 years ago, but the US hasn’t even gone that far. We have COPPA, but when the largest fines being issued to the likes of Disney and TikTok (musical.ly at the time) are under 10 million for spying on our kids, it’s a cost of doing business.


>	In your argument about equality, you are only looking at one side of the coin: the people being advertised to. What about opportunities for the advertisers? Why are you forcing advertisers to waste money? Increase their marketing budgets and putting up a barrier to entry for smaller operations while not hurting the big players?

I am not looking at one side. I just don’t care about protecting unfair practices. Advertisers pay for effectiveness. Bidding for competitive keywords and such drives the price up. If these targeting engines become less effective and net a lower ROI, the price will come down to allow advertisers to cast a wider net to achieve similar conversion. Your basic grasp of how this works is lacking.


No one is entitled to track anyone and use their PII for profit. It’s fucking bullshit. Defending that is bullshit. You want more competition? Gimp the power players from having an insurmountable data advantage.


You know a big reason why people lack empathy in their business ethics? It’s because they break things down into segments of data that require zero human interaction. They create look-a-like audiences from audiences they’ve never spoken to or interacted with. If people had to spend time learning about their customers by doing qualitative research, this world would probably be a much better place because we’d understand nuance. Instead we’re optimizing ourselves into oblivion in the sole pursuit of profit.


Btw, next time don’t challenge someone’s understanding unless you’re really sure you know what you’re talking about. I’ve made a pretty good living off the intersection of technology and business.

I will not switch to them just because I live in medium sized town where you have to go through the middle of no where for like 20 mintues to get to any of the close by towns/cities.

It's more like a spa/country club but it's very traditional British, every room has completely different decor and is named after a type of tree, which I find adorable. The first time I stayed there I was gobsmacked by the size of my room and the four poster bed and the bathroom. The second time I stayed there I was in a completely different room which seemed smaller until I noticed the STAIRCASE up to the second floor of my room hosting just a bath with a built-in television and a round sofa. Bear in mind I was staying in this room alone. 

In the morning I looked out of my window and there were deer grazing on the grounds. For someone who is not used to anything like this I was in awe of the whole place.",best hotel to live in
17917,"My favorite right now is definitely Kylie! She’s mellowed out a lot ever since she had stormi and I think for a little while she went thru that teenager phase where she was rude to her parents and just didn’t seem very interested in doing family things but you also have to understand she was acting in ways normal teens would but she was being filmed and able to be judged, and also her dad transitioned to Caitlyn when she was I think only 17 or 18?  Which probably was a lot for her to deal with and she probably came off very dry and rude when she was just hurting. But anyways when she was a teen she wasn’t one of my favorites but now I really like her because she does a lot of donating and helping people in need behind closed doors and doesn’t brag about it, and she also stays out of the drama and even when everything happened with Jordyn last year she didn’t go off about jordyn on tv like her sisters did which I thought was cool of her!

It’s not difficult. But a bunch of programmers all going “lul it’s not difficult” and then rolling their own everything becomes difficult to maintain.

Edit: to give you an idea - I have to write documentation to hand off to the client for any app I build.

If I use axios I can properly wrap it so it can be swapped out later and then simply link to the axios docs. If I write my own I must document it.

This would be fine for just fetch, but if you apply this mentality broadly you end up reinventing the wheel a bunch of times and then having to document it every time.",axios alternatives reddit
