"Many folks overseas wrap their luggage in Saran Wrap (cling film).

One problem in 3rd world countries is that they will open your luggage and insert drugs, to later on be ""found"" at customs, so they can lock you up and then get you to pay them thousands of dollars in bribes to be released.

Zip ties have one problem - they can be replaced with new zip ties.

200 feet of cling film is a PITA for a cargo clerk to unwrap or cut away and dispose of discretely."

"It would still be useful information, because for a prospective buyer, it's interesting to know at what point the CPU is no longer bottlenecking the GPU. If a 3300X is enough to run a certain game when matched with a high end GPU, then there's no need to fork out the money for a 10900K or 3900X and that extra money could be better spent on a GPU upgrade.

There's value both in seeing what the theoretical power of each CPU is in a gaming scenario and in seeing how much of that power you really need before other parts start holding you back."
