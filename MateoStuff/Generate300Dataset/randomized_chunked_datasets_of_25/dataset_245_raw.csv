"I second Visible, except it's heavily deprioritized and capped at 5Mbps. However, it's been great - except the 80-90ms latency. I am on At&t prepaid after being on Sprint's Kickstart unlimited and getting pissed off with the service issues when I have 3 to 4 bars."
"I'm not an expert but obviously if you go camping you boil river water. Of course if there's nasty chemical stuff like heavy metals or whatever, that's not going to help. Maybe that's what the filters are for?"
"A million thanks!

Oh, and some of the comments on that page are golden:

make egg cups in a muffin tin. drop them in place wherever you would use hard boiled eggs.
"Just letting you know, there is some construction happening near FT at the moment. I have no idea when it'll be done, but it's quite literally right next to the dorms. Most of the time it's not that loud, but it's a bit of an eyesore when you have a beautiful mountain landscape outside your window. 

Besides that, I am a supporter of the FT experience."
I hope you mean from craigslist and not WalMart
I think this sorts of lists should do a one album per artist. Other than that all albums are fine af and well deserved to be on the list.
He lives in a hotel. An outlet to charge his kindle shouldn't be too hard to come by.
Fiji and Evian have high ph and I hate them.
"Yeah, but when it's $5 to $10 more than HF, it's a bit of a rip off."

"Surprisingly, it *wasn't* the headlines (which were a few weeks after launch) that it was tap water that screwed them. (I guess it's not *that* surprising, though, since they were pretty open about it.) It was the bromate contamination."
Then you do your own research and just use the list as starting point kiddo.
"What is good coffee? I'm not a coffee drinker, but that might be because all I've ever had was instant."
"I'm American but I've been living in Germany for a year and have spent a lot of time staying with German families. 

German breakfast is the best. In my experience, a big basket of rolls and bread will be set on the table. Then an assortment of various delicious itemsâ€”cheese, cold cuts, sausage, jam, Nutella, cream cheese, etc.,â€”are on the table as well. You grab a roll or two, butter them up, and put whatever ingredients you want on your various pieces of bread. 

It's great because it gives you a bunch of delicious options, plus it's not hard at all to set up or clean up. You just bring out the ingredients in their containers, and then when you're done you put them back in the fridge. No pots and pans to clean up, just the plates."
"According to the article, I downgraded.

FML."
"Ballsy Move Cotton, We'll see if it pays off."
"I remember looking into law. Almost every thing I read was burnout, burnout, burnout."
"I have an orange room in my house. Well, three fourths of a room. It's pretty open concept. It's our music/hangout room where we keep all our instruments and have a big comfy sectional. We balanced it out with a lot of blues and it looks wonderful. Certainly not for everyone but at the end of the day it's only paint ðŸ˜„"
"Donâ€™t know if youâ€™ll get it where you are, (iâ€™m in the UK) the naked scientist is awesome."
Yeah. Iâ€™d rather cut it down and replace it with a lower maintenance tree. Itâ€™s not that big so it would be fairly easy to do. I just need to find the right tree to replace it. And Iâ€™d move it farther from my sewer line than the crabapple is.
">World War I - justified. the germans tried to entice mexico to attack the US. Also german unrestricted u-boat attacks.

No they didn't.  WW1 was completely unjustified.  The us complained about uboats, but ignored the much more extensive British blockade of Germany.  Mexico was in the middle of a civil war at the time and completely incapable of attacking the US.  In fact, there was a US force in mexico at the time hunting down Pancho Villa.

As for Korea and Vietnam, defending sovereign nations from invaders attempting to impose a murderous ideology by force of arms is just about the definition of justifiable war."
"zebra works fine for me, just reinstall?"
