23546,best car racing video game,"Need For Speed Most Wanted/Carbon/Underground. Pretty old game YES, but to my knowledge we never got better after those.

EDIT: Had many reply, thanks guys ! I will take a look at NFS Heat, but I want to point out at people who still play the old NFS to use VSR/DSR (Virtual Super Resolution AMD GPU/ Dynamic Super Resolution NVIDIA GPU).

VSR/DSR will make your GPU render the game at higher resolution (2K/4k/6k), then downscale to your screen resolution. This will improve the look of the game, sharpness with low impact on your GPU. (deactivate all Anti Aliasing when using this)"
