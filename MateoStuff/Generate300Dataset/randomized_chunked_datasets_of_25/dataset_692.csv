13999,"There was some discussion about this a while back. It seems like the idea crops up every now and then.

I personally don't mind this ""fragmentation"". Each community is a microcosm and fully in control of their little sphere, and yet they are all part of a giant transcosmic network: cross-posts happen when somebody in one microcosm discovers something interesting to another microcosm, and while some redditors will be subscribed to both subreddits, that's not really a problem.

I'm subscribed to practically **every** science-related subreddit, and I have not once been annoyed by a double post.",best research paper archive

I believe you are already starting off wrong just by asking this.  To go about learning, you start to learn.

17687,"Time Locker is one of my favorites. It is a simple endless runner game with a truly unique premise. The character you play as shoots projectiles out in front of them. The enemies move quickly across the screen, bump into any one of them and you lose. However, there’s a twist: If you stop moving, the enemies freeze as well. The hectic speed becomes carful bursts of motion, strategy. There is a line that slowly peruses the character to prevent you from stalling.

It’s a fantastic game, with purchases only for powerups/OP characters that aren’t needed to enjoy the single player, endless runner experience.",best iOS game
