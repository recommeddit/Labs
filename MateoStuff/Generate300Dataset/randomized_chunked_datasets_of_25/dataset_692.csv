15588,best tree for the garden,I'd plant bamboo. Timber varieties take about 5 to 10 years to mature.
47706,best state to visit in the United States,"Come and see the hurricane.

Also Big Bend National Park is really nice.

But don't stay too long.  We're watching you."
13999,best research paper archive,"There was some discussion about this a while back. It seems like the idea crops up every now and then.

I personally don't mind this ""fragmentation"". Each community is a microcosm and fully in control of their little sphere, and yet they are all part of a giant transcosmic network: cross-posts happen when somebody in one microcosm discovers something interesting to another microcosm, and while some redditors will be subscribed to both subreddits, that's not really a problem.

I'm subscribed to practically **every** science-related subreddit, and I have not once been annoyed by a double post."

Hope I've formatting the referencing peoples comments correctly, let me know if there's a better way! 

Final note, if you like these sorts of videos, also check out [Pogo's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVxe5NIABsI) work. The level of video slicing is far below Fan.tasia but the way it describes the music mix is great."
25847,best cricket teams of all time,What I found remarkable in watching those high quality highlights from cricket Australia (85 tour I believe?) was the quality of the fielding that WI exhibited. Their catching in the slips but also in the covers was freaky and felt comparable to the best the modern game has to offer.
65814,best college in california,"im only targeting UCI for my daughter. even w/o scholarship/aid, i think we can afford her tuition as long she stays at home"
4956,best home improvement store,"I'm currently boycotting my local Lowe's since they mismanaged the installation of a replacement front door and garage door and delayed it by several months. It was about 2 years ago and I'm still salty.

Going to Home Depot instead is easy since they're typically across the street from Lowe's anyway, at least around here."
41362,best instrument to play,The human voice.
35737,best alcoholic drink,"Came here to champion the Kraken Dark and Stormy, good on you."
51767,best iphone case,"dbrand Black Matrix on a white 12 mini. I wanted more grip. Originally ordered the white skin, but it has a pretty cheap feel and I was very disappointed (first time ever I didn't like a dbrand skin, and I've been using them for years.) dbrand was awesome and sent a replacement for the cost of shipping. (I also have a metal plate on the back of the phone for my car mount...until I find the right Magsafe solution...so wanted to cover it up.)"
60090,best perfume,I love that one too!
66299,best soccer team in the world,"Arsenal won the Cup Winners' Cup, same as Manchester City... if you're going to discredit theirs, you should also discredit yours."
3364,best webcamera,But the c920 mic isnt half bad so if your needing a cheap start and are trying to pick between a mic and a webcam you get both...... Also it won't overheat or fall apart like many cheap knockoffs do.
59323,best perfume,La vie est belle by Lancome is incredible and lasts all day!
66576,best soccer team in the world,"The list also leaves out the more recent Milan side that won 2 CLs and lost a final to Liverpool alongside winning the league and Club World Cup. That side was definently a top 20 team, 2002-2007 ish."
41208,best instrument to play,"> and how should I go about learning it?

I believe you are already starting off wrong just by asking this.  To go about learning, you start to learn.

Just start.

Pick up a used acoustic guitar, head over to songsterr.com, and slowly and painfully learn to play a song that you enjoy."
30738,best country to live in,"Only Americans compare everything to ""American standards""."
38403,best newspapers to read,"Wow, how do you manage the time? It takes quite a few hours to get through an Economist magazine for me..."
55806,best action and adventure movie,"I have no idea how this hasn't already been mentioned, but Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a genuinely perfect action adventure movie and a true classic. Such a whimsical, grand, epic adventure that is pure, unadulterated fun from start to finish. From the sets to the fight choreography to the score to Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, they really don't make movies like it anymore."
17687,best iOS game,"Time Locker is one of my favorites. It is a simple endless runner game with a truly unique premise. The character you play as shoots projectiles out in front of them. The enemies move quickly across the screen, bump into any one of them and you lose. However, there’s a twist: If you stop moving, the enemies freeze as well. The hectic speed becomes carful bursts of motion, strategy. There is a line that slowly peruses the character to prevent you from stalling.

It’s a fantastic game, with purchases only for powerups/OP characters that aren’t needed to enjoy the single player, endless runner experience."
22412,best celebrity,"Used to do delivery runs for a catering company, and we would get a lot of celebrities at the airport that ordered from us. Johnny Depp was the only one I ever saw face to face. Dude pulled a wadded up bill from his pocket and tossed it at me. I thought it was cool I got a tip directly from him at all, but once I had it all unwadded it was $100 bill."
