57180,best water brand,"Plastic recycling is a poor alternative to not generating waste, though. Recycled plastic is mostly downcycled, pollutes anyway, and is often just thrown away if nothing can be done with it.

 I mean I do it too, and am not happy about it. But better not to kid ourselves."

12172,best gifts for dad,I usually just make a slightly larger purchase and enjoy shelling out $1.37 for a video game I've been wanting.
51514,best iphone case,"I just recently got the 12 Pro.  I’ve been using one of the clear, $5 onn. cases from Walmart.  I originally got this case with the intention of picking out a better one soon after, but I’m pleasantly surprised with the onn. case.  I’ve had it (and the phone) for about a month and it’s protected me from a couple of minor drops here and there.

My only criticism is that it doesn’t have official MagSafe support (no magnets built into the case).  That’s a non-issue for me because I don’t currently have any MagSafe accessories, but I can definitely see where it may be off-putting to potential buyers.

Edit: for anybody with the Otterbox Figura for the 12, how does it compare to the Apple silicone cases?"

65989,best college in california,Not to mention Merced is super small I think compared to Santa Cruz enrollment.
30016,best money managing app,"Honestly the best thing that works for me is an Excel spreadsheet. I have to track everything manually, but my budget is not very complex. I tried a few options like Mint, but never got much out of them. The Excel app is free if you sign in with an outlook email."
51541,best iphone case,What do you recommend?
64468,Best Nike running shoes,"Me, too. This is my shoe. I love them so much that I also buy boys and girls models for walking and short runs. Prior to that, I'd worn Lunarlon exclusively for five years, but I vastly prefer the Lunarglides."

70194,best major to study in college,"I've got about 5 years of full time experience, and am currently doing mobile UI design at an agency in Seattle. Mobile is 'hot' right now, so having a few years experience and some apps in the app store helps.

Graphic design is a hard career to get into, but once you've got your foot in the door, it isn't as scary as these lists would imply."

21190,best workout music,"I usually listen to really heavy hip hop and rap when I lift but recently I've been trying something new. Instead of trying to get my blood pressure up, I put on some chiller producers and try to meditate a little while I lift.  I find it actually helps me focus more on my form and breathe well through my heavy sets. Most recently it's been [Do What You Love by Ta-Ku](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q5dOMK9rcM)."
21917,best winnie the pooh comic,nellie has left the nest... will he learn to fly?
30139,best Mexican war to study,Yeah I agree with this. I’m reading *What Hath God Wrought* which is a very detailed historical text which covers 1815-1845 and I really have a hard time feeling sympathetic to one imperial power when another comes and does the same thing to it that it had been doing to everyone else.

33327,best electric car,"There’s currently no non-destructive way to know if a battery cell is good or not, so they’ll end up replacing them all. About $12k per car is what they’ve set aside."
