51514,"I just recently got the 12 Pro.  I’ve been using one of the clear, $5 onn. cases from Walmart.  I originally got this case with the intention of picking out a better one soon after, but I’m pleasantly surprised with the onn. case.  I’ve had it (and the phone) for about a month and it’s protected me from a couple of minor drops here and there.

My only criticism is that it doesn’t have official MagSafe support (no magnets built into the case).  That’s a non-issue for me because I don’t currently have any MagSafe accessories, but I can definitely see where it may be off-putting to potential buyers.
