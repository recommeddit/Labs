65661,"I have T-Mobile. With my plan, I have ""unlimited data"" which is really just 3GB, but you can buy more. I never use 3GB because I'll be on wifi for most of the day.

I'm mostly in South LA. Cell service is fine, I always have LTE (not always full bars). However, in the Malibu area I only have 4G or sometimes 3G--gets a little spotty. 

I think verizon is better with cell service overall, but T-Mobile is cheaper. And the jump program is amazing! I love my freedom to switch phones.

At the end of the day, I can reliably make calls, texts, and use data. It can be spotty (like I said, range in LTE changes) but not disruptive.",best phone service company

The waiter at breakfast was hilarious and tried so hard to interact with us in English and even laughed at our jokes.
