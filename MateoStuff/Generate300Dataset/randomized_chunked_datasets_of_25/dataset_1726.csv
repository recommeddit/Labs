7455,best laptop for general use,"If you're referring to the Eluktronics MAX-17, that's a great choice too. The RTX 3070 is worth spending more for if possible."
38703,best newspapers to read,yes although your description is biased horse shit. Just like mine about the Guardian was.
65661,best phone service company,"I have T-Mobile. With my plan, I have ""unlimited data"" which is really just 3GB, but you can buy more. I never use 3GB because I'll be on wifi for most of the day.

I'm mostly in South LA. Cell service is fine, I always have LTE (not always full bars). However, in the Malibu area I only have 4G or sometimes 3G--gets a little spotty. 

I think verizon is better with cell service overall, but T-Mobile is cheaper. And the jump program is amazing! I love my freedom to switch phones.

At the end of the day, I can reliably make calls, texts, and use data. It can be spotty (like I said, range in LTE changes) but not disruptive."
65086,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,This right here.

46131,best trick or treating candy,"Dum Dum Pops are the best!  They come in a ton of different flavors, and they're small enough that you can keep It in your mouth and still talk to people.

And I dont know why people hate necco wafers but they should send them all to me."

32082,best hotel to live in,"Hotel Chinzanso in Tokyo. It was my first 5 star hotel. The tub fit both me and my boyfriend comfortably and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. The waiter at breakfast was hilarious and tried so hard to interact with us in English and even laughed at our jokes. I wish I could talk about the spa, but as a tattooed woman, I wasn't allowed in unless I wore a body suit or bandaged all my tattoos.... But I bet it was awesome..."
10969,best backpack for college,"I'd recommend maybe checking out Targus or Swiss Army for something more geared toward also housing a laptop.  My Targus bag is pushing 15+ years old.  It has made it through my college days, countless airport runs, and tons of general use.  It currently houses a 15.4"" laptop and the recording gear I haul around, plus the straps are still squishy and comfortable.  And if it matters, the above brands have a bit more mature/sophisticated styling."
