"VRR On fixes the broken LFC, but instead introduces judder in motion, when camera moves slowly is noticable, try to use a controler's analog to move the camera in a slow and steady speed, youll see the judder, then turn VRR off and try it again, judder is gone !"
Halfa granola bar you left in the car yesterday and some flat Dr. Pepper
Un Petite Ceasars on Milpas.
I'd add Moon to that list OP
This guy shits.
"France got to the 2016 finals and won 2018. They topped this Nation's League group, so probably friendlies count too much toward this"

"I use a Datsusara backpack. They primarily aim towards martial arts/MMA markets but when I'm not using it to carry my BJJ gi to the gym I use it as my everyday bag. 

It's made from hemp so it's as tough as you like and because hemp has anti bacterial properties it does help your bag from getting stunk out by gym gear etc. also has a laptop slot in it too."
"If you're asking this in the context of ""I need an editor that I can quickly download/use in various places"", Notepad++ is very good.

Otherwise, it's still good but you'll be noticing some of the annoyances in it (like hanging on big files)."
"Company of Strangers by Melissa McShane is a fun book. It’s a pretty basic premise, strangers group up to go explore some ruins. 

The Copper Promise by Jen Williams - three adventurers try to figure out what’s going on and explore some ruins. 

Also, check out Barrayar by Lois McMaster Bujold. That kicks off the Miles Vorkosigan books and that is some of the absolute best character driven space opera out there."

"Reddit has a bias too, hivemind and all that"
"Thanks, and right back at ya!"

"I’m just worried about ordering it then having it not be comfortable for palm you know, cause there isn’t like a resale value so I’d like 100% lose money"
"I was just looking for that.

Awesome movie and horribly mindfucked"
cd on exit isn't working for me with osx mohave/python 3.7
"> followed by two minutes to peel

What's your trick?

I swear I've tried everything (and I've tried in different countries, too, in case American eggs are weird) but I can never peel an egg I've boiled in anything short of a minute apiece, with lots of shards and flakes and general annoyance.

Meanwhile, boiled eggs in hotels always peel flawlessly."
"Unfortunately, Notability [doesn't support](https://support.gingerlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/205724867-Writing-with-Bluetooth-Styluses) pressure sensitivity, except with the Apple Pencil (there was some conflicting info on this, so, I bought and tried it, but it doesn't work)."
"No, this town has the world's shittiest pizza. Bettina, mollies, and petrinis are way too expensive for pizza--and just ok. Lucky penny sucks; giovannis sucks; ptaxis sucks; rusty's is an abomination; woodstock isn't even pizza; martys used to be ok for the money, but now it sucks. Haven't tried Ginos or Middle Child."
"Tibetan Mountain Temple from Pacifica. It's really nice, kind of an incense smell but not too strong."
"What kind of oatmeal? Just a plain one? 
I'm curious about this."
"Sometimes, it's hard enough to just figure out how to set up the integral, and graphing calculators also allow integrals of integrands with non-elementary antiderivatives (that don't yield to some special techniques) to be easily estimated."
I'm not. BGT in my experience has been busier than SWO.
