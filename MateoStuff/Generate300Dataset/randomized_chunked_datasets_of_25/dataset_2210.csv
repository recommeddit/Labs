10823,best suitcase lock,"That's why you travel with a firearm. You declare it to your airline, they have you walk it over to TSA baggage screening. They screen it in front of you, then you lock your hard-sided case with a non-TSA lock.  They are not supposed to open it without you present.

Don't want to travel with an actual firearm, or can't because of state laws? Flare guns are legal in every state and considered firearms. (You just can't travel with flares.) [edit] also starter guns, which can only fire blanks.

[edit2] Obviously only works in the US, and obviously should only be in your checked luggage. Look up the TSA and airline regulations."
40486,best midrange GPU,"It is absolutely beyond me watching PC gamers duct tape two dollars to a subsandwich and then cry on it and say to themselves "" Here it is, heres a hail mary, maybe somebody will hear my cries."" and they throw the sub it cries tears of the pc gamer and somewhere along the way a lone pedestrian hears these cries from the sub as it flies by, and this complete stranger comes and works 55 hours with OT just so this pc gamer can finally rest and play on the 2060 acquired from working hours.

It is flawless how much of the Pc gaming community is broke on cue.

Like should Dr.Disrespect hold a seminar on Finance so you can all be reached equally at one time? orr??

Maybe you should go pick up some hours like the guy who just bought a 3060ti for whatever price for whoever cares.

All i'm saying is all this time spent on micromanaging low performance graphics cards and just pick up some extra hours, get an extra job possibly, sell some stuff, i dont know figure it I dont care clearly but my god you guys, lolol.

I've been reading threads on like budget gpu's and shit and its like bro I really dont think its the price of GPU's lately, taking into consideration of bots, miners, shortage, it's like broooo you shouldnt be pc gaming lolololo.

Like all these broke ass dudes like what are you fucking doing, Im not saying you cant have fun and that everybodys got fat stacks, but if you dont have the mobility to get a good graphics card financially....????

I'm just confused because I really think my priorities are vastly different than what im seeing.

I thought Pc gaming mid tier was like the toyota of gaming and ya'll acting like you cant buy a cv axle, you should probalby get some shit together?"

Edit: Other good books not on the list: *A Canticle for Lebowitz*, *Fahrenheit 451*, and *1984* (although I guess this one is debatable on being Sci-Fi)"
