I've been reading threads on like budget gpu's and shit and its like bro I really dont think its the price of GPU's lately, taking into consideration of bots, miners, shortage, it's like broooo you shouldnt be pc gaming lolololo.

Like all these broke ass dudes like what are you fucking doing, Im not saying you cant have fun and that everybodys got fat stacks, but if you dont have the mobility to get a good graphics card financially....????

I'm just confused because I really think my priorities are vastly different than what im seeing.
