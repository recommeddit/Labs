73892,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Everyone seems to be recommending PaperLike, but I don’t think anyone has mentioned the huge drawback of it and that is that you loose the sharpness, brightness and colors from the original iPad screen! Which is a huge bummer if you want to watch movie or videos aswell on your iPad! I actually think nearly all Matte protectors will do this, and the only way to avoid it is to use clear protectors or glass protectors."
58002,best cologne,"Go to Macy's, Nordstrom, or really any upscale department store with a fragrance counter. They will give/sell you a tiny tester of most fragrances that you can take home. L'homme is a major flagship right now, so your odds are pretty good they'll have some on hand.
  
They can also just spray a tester on you. Give it a few hours and see if you still like it.
  
I'm a woman, but I made my husband pick a cologne for our wedding. Some scents we really liked straight out of the bottle (like Sauvage), but smelled like musty old man after a few hours. We actually did end up choosing L'homme because the scent didn't change too much on his skin. But this is 100% up to your own skin chemistry and preferences."
61662,Best RPG game on PS4,"I assume you're asking for PS4 games only, so:

* Final Fantasy X (Remastered)
* Witcher 3
* Monster Hunter: World 

Also to be nitpicky, you don't have to say RPG games as RPG means ""Role-Playing Game"". Enjoy working from home and hopefully being able to play some awesome games between work."

70358,best major to study in college,"As someone in a pseduo-hard science (environmental policy), i wish i would've picked up a minor or double major in GIS/some other spatial technology. i'm finding it hard to market myself since i have one foot in science & one foot in policy."

56364,best desktop monitor,"This sub seems to think stuff like this but there's no way. Firstly unless it's able to hit and sustain 1000nits, it won't be a true HDR display, most OLEDs are around 600nits give or take, not too different than the top performing HDR600 monitors like the G7, AW2721D, GN950 for example. 

Where obviously the OLED wins out is lack of backlight for black depth, it's superior to any LCD here and overall is a superior experience to other HDR600 displays and superior to any LCD regardless of brightness coverage when it comes to dark extension but when it comes to producing highlights and creating a dynamic top end they do not produce that.

Most HDR1000 sets with Full Array are just simply better for HDR use and while they do produce halos in dark scenes, they can still create good black depth, enough so that it's true to the content unless the content as purposely made with OLED in mind to which most content isn't which is why OLEDs need more tinkering.

OLEDs are a niche product, the 42"" will sale for more and  I can assure you most people will go for a gaming monitor than fork out for an OLED which will degrade in a couple of years and still has the same issues like uniformity, white, grey, just like all panels regardless of tech. OLED is superior in a few aspects, no1 is denying that, I use 4 at work for various tasks and I have my own trusty B8 that I use and abuse for all content at home but they're not perfect and the savior like people on this sub like to make out."
