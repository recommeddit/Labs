All Navy ships filter the sea water for drinking.  Aren't you still required to be ESWS qualified to take an advancement exam?  You should know they add minerals to water if you paid attention.
[Skydive Santa Barbara](https://www.skydivesantabarbara.com/) is where I went.  It was an amazing experience.
"Kalimba, aka the finger piano? Melodica? Harmonica? Start with YouTube for instruction. And get a method book for beginners, search for melodica method book or harmonica method book, etc."
"I FULLY UNDERSTAND the request here, and I normally would not suggest this given what you are asking but I fully recommend watching Dark. It may tell a sci-fi story, but god damn does it have some of the best acting and drama a Netflix show can have. 

I highly suggest giving it a shot despite the general story being based around time travel. Plenty of real world mystery and thrills to go along with the sci-fi nature of the show imo."
"No brainer, it’s a great futuristic show."

">Gomez, Phillips, Tammy, AWB and the like would hardly be as valuable if they weren't English.

I know you're just commenting on these players because they mentioned them, but it's worth noting that all of these (except Phillips) didn't get called up, so their value is irrelevant for the graphic regardless"

Man what a pleasure it was to watch predestination without knowing anything about it. I imagine that feeling is what people watching the sixth sense in theaters felt
MR HEATY!! That's cute as fuck
hell jeaaaaa
The link and specs are on the list.
"Ain't nothing wrong with that! Simple, and effective! Lets you know who the bad guy is just by mere mention"
"Once you have steel cut or quick 1 minute whole grain oats, you can never go back to the instant oatmeal in the packets. Instant is disgustingly mushy and smooth, like baby oatmeal. Also, way too sweet!

1/2 cup oatmeal, 1 cup milk and 1 Tb. brown sugar mixed in a coffee mug doesn't look like a lot, but it will fill you up for several hours. If I eat this before I leave the house, I'm not even hungry at first break at work (9AM)."

"Charging up my Anker here in NorCal, in case my electricity goes out. 

Fully charged, it will recharge my iPhone 3 times."
"I'm only on 40km with this, but I can't help to notice that I need to push harder to get faster? Even when I'm running slow for easy run it just didn't gave me the response I needed. Too soft perhaps.."
Cool.  I've been thinking about moving to a residence hotel and cooking my own meals.
+1. I get complimented constantly on how good I smell with Armaf. Really good value.
"I have T-Mobile. We switch from at&t ac a couple of years ago since at&t had gotten super expensive. 

I like them, I don’t usually have issues with service."
"Cypress, without a doubt. It has a beautiful sculpted shape and smells sharp and fresh. Anyone who disagrees is a fool."
"I've not used Excel Online (but it sounds pretty cool!)

Libre is most like Excel but worse.

Google Sheets **do some things way better than excel** (Shared workbooks for instance).  It's a bit of a different tool, but well worth learning, and in many ways compatible."
"Surprised Irvine and SB are ahead of SD now, that wasn’t the case a decade ago when I went to school."

Plants vs Zombies 1

I play a few more here and there, but after quitting Hearthstone a year ago these are the games I keep coming back to. I guess I like mild strategy without crazy difficulty. 

I was excited to purchase Slay the Spire when it released, but quickly realized that after 100+ hours on PC I was a little burned out and the iOS controls were too slow for the pace I’d gotten used to. Same thing happened with FTL. As a casual player, it can be surprising how much reducing moves per minute can slow a game down to a crawl. Even using a mouse on the iPad doesn’t compare to a computer. If I’d started these games on iOS, I’d probably still be hooked on them. 

Not sure why I explained all that, but there it is."
