11194,best backpack for college,"I like [Mountainsmith](http://www.mountainsmith.com/) myself; the stuff I have from them just feels so well-built. And they make dog packs, so you know they are cool."
10331,best suitcase lock,"They're pretty cheap too, you can easily find one for under 50 dollars. Just don't try firing live ammunition from it, or you'll be in for a surprise."

23811,best car racing video game,I really enjoyed dirt 2. It's not on steam though sadly. It's one of the few racing games that has my actual car in it.
32696,best vacation resort,I’m guessing the Virgin Islands are out?  Just trying to figure out the need to be in continental US specifically.  If you can fly (like to FL or TX) then maybe it’s because of insurance? In which case would the US Virgin Islands work?  I thought I saw something about resorts there in my T&L magazine.  Good luck in your search!  It’s such a blessing to have generous in laws!! :)
53656,best medicine for a cold,"The placebo effect is an interesting phenomenon, though. In the area of OTC cough medicines in general there’s not a ton of evidence or a ton of research, probably at least in part because the symptoms are so relatively benign and self-limited they’re not a huge priority in the medical field. 

But if something works “as well” as a placebo...is that really such a bad thing? It’s impossible to sell somebody a placebo, because if you know it’s a placebo it’s unethical, and if they know it’s a placebo then the spell is lifted. But if you give somebody a pill and they report relief of their symptoms...who cares about the exact physiologic mechanism? Of course, there’s the issue of undesirable side effects, which I’ll give you for DM, but generally not at standard therapeutic doses."

56618,best desktop monitor,"Until the end of the year I want to pick one of those:   
* Dell S2716DG (TN)    
* ASUS PG279Q (IPS)     
* Dell Alienware AW3418DW (Ultrawide IPS, but ""only"" 120Hz)


Right now I'm using an old 1080p 60Hz 24"" TN Monitor (BenQ G2420HD), so any of the above will be a huge upgrade.     
I'm just not sure if IPS would be worth the extra money and Ultrawide seems tempting, but it's hard to tell if I would even like it.


Currently I'm playing mostly Rocket League, Dragonball FighterZ, Dota 2, Eternal and I'm looking forward to Monster Hunter World, but that would probably need a GPU upgrade immediately since I'm still on a GTX 580.


Any input will be appreciated :)"
