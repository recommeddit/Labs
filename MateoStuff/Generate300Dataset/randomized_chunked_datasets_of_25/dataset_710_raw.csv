"Out of interest, why didn't you go for the XS which is a similar price?"
"It's a sad day the first time you detect the Daily Mail's views in your mother or father's conversations. They'd always been there, but it's a matter of growing up enough so that you can pick it up. I felt like I lost my childhood, the first time I saw my mum as a 'Daily Mail reader'."

"no, you have to do it twice in a while. At least 4."
It made me laugh and it made me cry
That's something I would be worried about.

"But, of the top 20 or so, unquestionably the only one that a new hobbiest could buy blindly and be almost guaranteed to understand and enjoy."
"I’ll bite. I acknowledge he was the most succesful rapper in the early 00’s. I was excited about the SSLP and the MMLP. Loved his verses on Devil’s Night, but was slightly dissapointed when The Eminem Show came out. Loved the 8 Mile soundtrack.

Nothing after that *really* excited me. The technical ability is there but I think he has a bad taste in beats and hooks. Great rapper who makes music that sounds bad to me. And making good music is an important factor to me to be a good rapper. Which is why he stays out of the top 5 to me."

Yeah that's a good point! One of the my first fondest memories was watching that late at night as a kid staying up past my bedtime!
Yikes that is kind of gross. Though as a kid I probably would've eaten that candy if my mom wasn't looking. Great tip thanks! I should probably shave and actually put on a clean shirt so I don't scare the parents.

"Dude, if you smell good, girls will compliment you on it regularly."
A full set of screwdrivers in a nice little carrying bag. That man protects that little bag of tools with his life and carries it with him frigging everywhere. It makes me happy that I gave him something that he could have bought for himself anytime but never thought to.
