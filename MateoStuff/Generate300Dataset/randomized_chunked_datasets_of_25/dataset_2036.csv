73096,best Linux distro,"It's worked mostly out of the box for me. I had a problem with no DisplayPort sound coming out of my Radeon 5700 XT, that traced back to the 5.9.15-1 kernel. Upgrading to 5.10.1 solved that problem."

We've always had a kind of ""Whatever wants to live here can live here"" policy when it comes to our yard. We don't use any pesticides or insecticides unless we're killing wasps or fire ants. Because fuck fire ants and wasps. We have lots of bunnies (they like our yard cuz no dogs), birbs (although,  fuck the damn mourning doves right in the ass. Seriously. EVERY GODDAMNED MORNING. ""Coo. Coo. We are DOVES. We are the only ones who get to be DOVES. Coo, motherfucker.""), geckos, a few other lizards (anatoles I think probably) and I've seen a couple of small snakes.  I've never understood the ""OMG KILL IT KILL IT ALL RIGHT NOW!"" attitude that a lot of people take when it comes to critters living in their yards. As long as it's not actively trying to assassinate me with a bite or a sting (because again, fuck wasps and fire ants), why should I bother it at all? The critter can go its way and I'll just try to be kind to it. Because they deserve to live too. :)"
53527,best medicine for a cold,">	See that's why I don't get the point of making the Rx anyway when docs are more than happy to Rx them when they know they won't do anything at all.

Because those post-visit patient surveys affect our reimbursement. You get a single 0 star survey and your medicaid reimbursement may fall by 5% *for all of your patients*. The system is set up to punish doctors who make the tough choices and tell the hard truths. Medicaid rewards doctors who make their patients happy, *even if that kills them*.

Doctors try to do the right thing, but with “Medicare for all” coming down the pike we just can’t afford to fight every battle."

17277,best iOS game,I’d like to recommend [Retro Bowl](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retro-bowl/id1478902583) ($0.99 full game unlock). It’s a fantastic Tecmo Bowl-inspired football game that has intuitive touch controls and surprisingly deep management elements. Here’s a [Pocket Gamer article](https://www.pocketgamer.com/articles/081967/retro-bowl-is-a-new-american-football-sim-for-ios-and-android-from-the-creators-of-new-star-soccer/) about it.

62207,Best RPG game on PS4,"If you really want an open world game you could go with final fantasy xv. It also has real time action combat. The game has quite a few problems but despite them its still a super enjoyable game with a ton of stuff to do. 

Final fantasy X is one of the older style games with turn based combat and it was the first ff game with voice acting. The story and the world are amazing. It is quite linear though, but that isnt a negative in my opinion. Many consider it one of the best in the franchise.

Final fantasy IX is also considered one of the best by many fans. The story is great, the music is great. It has a pretty large world. One common complaint is that the combat is really slow, so that might turn some people away.

Anyway you could always check out reviews or watch some gameplay to see which one is for you."

73880,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I have the paperlike and like it so much I never bothered trying others. I can’t notice image deterioration, in fact it does such a good job of hiding glare and smudges that I think it looks better with it that without it. 

I have the 12.9 and mostly use the pencil for note taking or marking up documents and it’s fantastic for that. My kid is a decent creative and loves drawing on it with procreate so much that she got a similar protector for her iPad Air."
64620,Best Nike running shoes,I have a pair of peg 37s in rotation and I have to disagree. They fit nice but the foam is not the one for me. It’s not soft enough to feel like a cushioning shoe and it barely has any bounce. They just feel kinda clunky generally.

68274,best science fiction novel,"* **Hyperion** -  I'm not entirely sure there's something that actually tops Hyperion in terms scale and how good it is. It's covers so much and just as *good*.
 * **Blindsight** - quite well-thought out and just pretty solid all around. My single favorite first contact story in all medium of story teeling. 
 * **The Last Question** by Isaac Asimov - Take the concept of entropy from physics then build an extremely meaningful short story around it. Theb you end up with the single most effective short story i've ever read and in fact i probably like more than alot of books i've read. 
 * **I have no mouth and I must scream** - The level of disturbing it has makes my skin crawl and it makes other depressing/disturbing stuff look like childrens book. Also the title is cool as hell
 * **Brave New World** - It explores a very interesting dystopian/utopian world. What makes this one of my favorites is that the themes it explores is quite disturbingly possibly a path that the evolution of human society will follow. Maybe not to the the same details but the spirit of the concepts can be seen as solutions to some of our issues."
32286,best hotel to live in,"Dead people. In some places there's a reasonable chance somebody has died in your bed. Obviously it varies with the type of hotel and its clientele, but some places you get deaths weekly (not that the hotel is unsafe but unfit old people over exerting themselves). One place I worked maybe 40% of the beds had been died in.

Bedbugs. They happen in every hotel. You might be paying $5k a night but your luggage was in the hold with everyone else's. If there's only one or two bugs and none in the adjacent rooms (diamond style, so above, below, and both sides) then you brought them in. 


You know what I never saw happen? Maids stealing. Everyone always points at the maids when they lose stuff but we always found it. No way the maids are risking their jobs over your used iPad or mall jewelry. With tips they make pretty decent money."
