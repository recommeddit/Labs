"Dude, stop spamming that article. Color theory has absolutely nothing to do with moods and stimulation, it's just about color perception."
"+1 for Moon, The Thirteenth Floor and Ex Machina. Those will seriously get you thinking.

As much as I enjoyed the eye candy in Ex Machina, I wish they hadn't sexualised it as much because a lot of people just either love or hate that part, focus on that and miss the main message.

Adding one to the list:

* Source Code

Not as mind blowing / applicable as the others, but none the less very interesting."
"Yeah, it's definitely a two-edged sword, customers love them but I sure can see how it would be a pain in the neck for the people having to create them."
"My opinion:

1. Toby did a good job doing the nerdy Peter Parker, but a bit too passive as Spider-Man. Also Sam Reimi.

2. Andrew did a good portrayal of Spider-Man, but his Peter was too douchey, and unfortunately in mediocre movies.

3. Tom's is a good balance of both."

"You're the first person to recommend Sensodyne for the average person, regardless of whether or not they experience tooth sensitivity. Most of the comments have said to use it IF you're sensitive, but I don't understand why you would wait to become sensitive before switching to it.... why not just use it all the time to avoid becoming sensitive in the first place??"
Absolutely love this team

I second Santa Clarita Diet. I scrolled past it many times thinking the premise looked dumb but once I gave in and watched the first episode... later that night I watched the last episode.
They would be more competitive for sure but they wouldnâ€™t dominate.
"+1 for online programs in real universities.  OP, look at your in-state system.  That's where you're going to find the cheapest tuition."
"Well, blocking would be a best primary strategy, but if a kid puts their hands on your dog after you've told them not to, you can remove those hands gently without much risk of being accused of anything. You'd do the same if they stuck their hands into your backpack."
"Dune, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Stand on Zanzibar

"You may have something called allium intolerance. Maybe if it takes a whole clove to make you feel it, it might not be too bad in your case."
"For quite a long time my country wasn't supported as well. I was offering in-app purchases via 3rd party e-commerce provider. Google did not complain about it. I kept this option even when Google Play Billing became available for developers from my country. Actually, I am still using it as the deadline for switching to Google Play Billing is September 30, 2021."
LetsGameItOut is also similar to Grey
