52757,best hiphop album,"Very solid points you have made there mate like the way you have backed them up. And I can see what you mean. I suppose when your talking BEST albums the era argument will come into play most of the time, me personally also havent given enough time to new(er) hip hop, so I will cop that one on the chin as a fan."

26686,best board games,"A few other suggestions I haven't seen mentioned:

Smash-up: This is a tongue-in-check card-based free-for-all battle. Mash up two genres like Zombies and Pirates to make your deck and then accumulate points to score bases.

Smallworlds: An area control game (a la Risk) but without the grind (there are a set number of turns). Fantasy races combine with unique modifiers to give each player different powers and abilities."

67803,axios alternatives reddit,"If your colleagues have many features to implement and bugs to fix, migrating the request library might not justify as a prioritised task. Especially when it's a lot of effort that has no impact to the end user or business as a whole.

It's ok to keep using `request` in the foreseeable future. It doesn't have any vulnerabilities now, in fact [it didn't for a while](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/request), and it's unlikely to have one any time soon. It has plenty of features and gets the job done.

I wouldn't choose `request` when starting a new project, but for existing projects I'd consider the migration to a different library more of a nice-to-have task."

9626,best dorm hall at UCSB,"So the two story dorms - anacapa, santa cruz, santa rosa - have no singles or doubles this year because of the large freshman class. San Mig is all small doubles, and san nic has all 3 options. I dont know how it will be next year, but this year the class was so big that they had to do this on the three two story dorms. FT would have been the best bet this year if you were banking on a double tbh."
