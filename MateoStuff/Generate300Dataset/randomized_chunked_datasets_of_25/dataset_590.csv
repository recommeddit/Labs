38013,"I completely agree. Black Panther on its own is just a generic action movie. It just has a better written plot than most others in its genre and Killmonger is pretty nuanced for a villain.

30712,"But because of your big geographical area and low density, your infrastructure is not very efficient. So I wouldn't agree on the geographic lottery. Your roads are heavily subsidised to keep competitive, and the budget can't last. A good example of the consequences of the big geographical area would be your phone prices. In europe you can get a plan like: All europe plan: 10 hours calling, unlimited text, 10 gbit data for 15 dollars. It's just to show that a lot of infrastructure logistics are much cheaper in areas that are more dense.",best country to live in
