5163,best home improvement store,"Sounds rather painful.  I'd pass.

49366,best gaming monitor,Ahhhhh gotcha
38013,best Marvel movie,"I completely agree. Black Panther on its own is just a generic action movie. It just has a better written plot than most others in its genre and Killmonger is pretty nuanced for a villain. That being said, the CGI especially at the end is quite bad. I'd be surprised that it was nominated for Best Picture but the Academy Awards are kind of a joke now."
52752,best hiphop album,Welll what should be in here then? It does say of all time? Maybe madvillain or non phixion future is now for me other then that not much I'd put up with the older stuff

52829,best hiphop album,I love you.
5160,best home improvement store,"yes, I agree!"
26835,best board games,"There are 25 scenarios in the booklet but you will play through about 15-17 in a campaign I think, and the first 4 are basically the tutorial. Still well worth the money though."
15445,best tree for the garden,Mimosa
24916,best spiderman actor,"Nicholas Hammond portrayed the best grown-up Peter Parker, possibly because he portrayed the only grown-up Peter Parker.

And I’ve gotta say, whoever wore the Spider-Man costume on The Electric Company was a terrific physical actor."
20704,best workout music,"Hot Blood - Kaleo

Now or Never - Zebrahead"
20465,best workout music,"Well since today, this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EVFKrmXFmA"
15870,best sunglasses for fashion,"If Luxottica makes virtually all of these brands that you listed, why would they be any different from each other in quality? I'm certain the Ray-Ban repairs percentage is simply because those are super popular compared to those other brands. Anectodally, I see way more Ray-Bans than any other luxury sunglasses brand on campus."
51725,best iphone case,Apple clear case and Alaskan Blue Silicone
9668,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I also want to point out that unless things have changed significantly, ""good"" is a very relative term."
61915,Best RPG game on PS4,"1st: Bloodborne 
2nd: The Witcher 3
3rd: Tales of Berseria
4th: Nier: Automata
5th: Disgaea 5"
23516,best car racing video game,"Also my problem with Forza Motorsport 7. I've been playing them since Forza Motorsport 2, and one of the things I *loved* was upgrading an unlikely car like a Mini or a Ford Fiesta, and setting them against much better cars like Ferraris or Lambos.

But in FM7 reviewers praised the ~~""Homogenisation""~~ ""homologation"" which basically meant you always got cars exactly the right spec to compete. Which might sound good on the surface, but it basically means every race is the same, just a different speed."
46680,best hand santizer brand,"I think they will close also. I just don’t see how they will be able to stay open because someone, whether a student or teacher, is either going to get it or come in contact with someone who has it. 
It is difficult to wear them for a long period of time. I don’t really expect a bunch of 8 - 10 year olds to wear them for 7+ hours."
42439,movies like Inception,"Man from Earth is a great Film! Not sure if it fits here, though."
22172,best celebrity,"Jennifer Aniston, I knew I recognized her but couldn’t figure from where so she leans over and whispered office space."
30712,best country to live in,"But because of your big geographical area and low density, your infrastructure is not very efficient. So I wouldn't agree on the geographic lottery. Your roads are heavily subsidised to keep competitive, and the budget can't last. A good example of the consequences of the big geographical area would be your phone prices. In europe you can get a plan like: All europe plan: 10 hours calling, unlimited text, 10 gbit data for 15 dollars. It's just to show that a lot of infrastructure logistics are much cheaper in areas that are more dense."
37522,best amusement park,"Just curious, what did you find trashy about it?  I've been there a few times and had great experiences."
56781,best desktop monitor,"I think P means that the monitor stand would be glossy and black, non-P versions are the transparent stands (or is it the other way around). Eitherway there's no technical difference between the two, only aesthetic diffences."
5356,best home improvement store,"www.websaurantstore.com it's a supply store for restaurants, but I've found some good stuff on there."
