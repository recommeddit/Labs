"I use Asana (and trello to an extent) on the big picture of a project but for me, there is nothing better than post it notes on the wall. 

I also have been known to use the Emergent Task Planner (also analog) over at https://davidseah.com/node/the-emergent-task-planner/ to help the day to day tasks.

Is this method electronic, no. Have I played with various project management pieces, yes, but to no avail.

Note: I think if I were in a team, I would gravitate 
 to an online platform. The last 48h film project we did, the Google suite of online tools was of key importance for a remote editor like myself."
"Best sun and moon or Gen 5. There the only pokemon games with actually good story. Handles child abuse well. Sun and moon is challeing if you remove the exp share and I love the trails and totem pokemon because it does something different than the gym thing we had for so long. Unnova has best villans Ghestis and N. Alder the champion has pretty good chacther development and Iris is some of the hardest champion.  

Worst Gen 6 

&#x200B;

In gen 6 I played without the exp share the gym leader have bad movsets and most only have 3 pokemon despite there being plenty of pokemon. By time you have mega Lucario fully evolved your starter and mega kanto starter gym leader still use wepinbell emoga magneton Mewostic and other weak pokemon. Mega is a interesting idea only 4 people use it kora is tutorial and you only need 2 hits to beat her. Serna does have mega until post game and her absol only can use slash and quick attack just get a ghost type teach it toxic curse or will wisp and you win. The champion is barely there and when she is it's more focused on lysandre than her and she is easy rivals are boring etc. I probably would not hate this game so much if it did not come after platinum and Unnova."
I had a crazy allergic reaction to Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. Canker sores all over my gums and under my tongue.  It was horrible. Bunch of similar accounts on any sort of consumer report website too.
"I have a Dell u2715h, but part of me has considered picking up a pair to use in tandem with my laptop, or maybe get some for my girlfriend to use with her laptop. Then I realize I've got adult financial responsibilities and I cry"
"[Economists tend to form their opinions based upon evidence](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gdahl/papers/views-among-economists.pdf). Politicians, not so much. As a result, Democrats and Republicans tend to [agree more with each other than with economists](http://college.holycross.edu/eej/Volume33/V33N1P81_94.pdf)."
"My employer put in a soda fountain last year instead.  Jeans are acceptable attire, but I usually wear khakis half the time as I lead a small team.  Yes, I'm in IT, but not CS."
"Arrival, gets you to think a lot"
Why do you prefer birds over rodeo or astro?
"I love YNAB, It's been life changing for me and I promote it to everyone. It's just a great way of viewing your money."
It is the bare bones one. I don't know if that's the one I'll end up getting but so far I'm not seeing anything major on the other models that I would want. The battery backup features doesn't interest me (I have a solar system with a battery).

INFINITELY funnier the second time you watch it
Do you just roll around in money?

Usually I just got excited when they would hand out full candy bars rather than fun-size.
The big problem I see in online school is slacking off.  My brother slacked off and did very little of his work as it was all due by a certain due date that was like a year ahead.  By last week he had a month's worth of work done and ten or eleven months to do in three weeks.  He's stayed awake with a combination of medicine and catnaps and I'm kind of worried about him.
I was recently told that Arizona State University has a wonderful online program
you can argue that Aquaman was one as well. At least I really enjoyed the dessert scenes.
Yes I do! New York Times and New York Magazine.

"I bought [these guys](http://www.vogue-eyewear.com/it/collezione-sole/vo4002s/996s-13) when I was in the States at Christmas which were my first pair that cost more than £15. I think they were around $90 or something close, so not crazy expensive but not cheap either. Sadly, I don't think I can go back; I love them too much!"
"heh, fair enough."
