I feel you on that fluffy shit. My girlfriend got me a pair of plush llamas for Christmas and I ~~squealed~~ politely thanked her for such a thoughtful gift.

Nuit d'issey is terrific. Sport is like the Budweiser of EDP's.
"How do you target your back? My chiro has one of these and he uses it every time I throw something out and have to go see him; it makes a world of difference.

I've seen these on Amazon and just never grabbed one cause I'm not sure how I can actually hit the trigger points on my back without becoming double jointed"
We’re 9th?!?!? LETS GOO CABRONES!
"Not in any particular order:

Minecraft

Dungeon Raid (RIP, Dungeon Falan as it's proxy)

The Quest (and expansions!)

868-HACK (hard to decide between this one and Imbroglio, I love them both)

Mindustry (which just got an AWESOME UPDATE!!!)"
"Not sure about worst but my favourites are homecoming, ragnarok, guardians, ant man 2. Endgame, infinity war and the first avengers film. The others are still really good but there my favourites. The fist and second Thor films were a bit boring"
Kit Kats and the mini crunch bars
"Well no, I'm sure it's not trivial when you don't understand promises and haven't even looked at a single page of Fetch documentation. I was going to write your code in a not insane way, but I got into it and I'm actually not even sure what you're trying to accomplish. 

This is what most of my quick-n-dirty fetches look like and I guess what you're trying to do? I'm not really sure why you're trying to create new Promises from within a Promise or trying to parse JSON from text instead of using the json response parser...... 

    fetch(/* */).then(res => {
      if (!res.ok) {
        throw new Error(res.message)
      }

      return res.json()
    })
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    .catch(err => console.error(err))

Edit: lol I looked at your links after I posted this code and this is almost identical to BOTH solutions you're saying proves it's not trivial. Wtf man. You know why all 3 of these things are exactly the same? **Because it's trivial.** 

How did you pull that insane code out of your butt based on this? It's literally ""if not ok, throw error""... how is this not trivial? Why are you rejecting instead of throwing? Why are you resolving instead of returning? Why do you have a weird `JSON.parse(res.text())` instead of `res.json()`, you're not even testing for any different return types or anything? Did you even look at those the answers in those links or just see a long winded confused question and decide to link them? 

You know what, don't answer. I'm just going to disable replies."
Same reason lol. Package management in debian based distros is such a clusterfuck. Pacman is superior to apt imo.
Destroyers of planets.
How to find the clients?
Bourbon on the rocks with a splash of water.
Yesssss. I feel like Possessor went kind of unnoticed. It was easily my favorite movie last year.
"One of those headband flashlights. Buy one and thank me later.

 My brother's wife made fun of him for getting me  one for Christmas. Turned out to be one of the most practical, useful gifts I've ever received. I use it at all the time."
"I live on a well that's in the Marcellus shale...we have some of the poorest water quality in the country (lots of iron, calcium, and sulfur.) We do have a water softener and a millipore line filter that gets rid of a lot of the junk as it's coming into the building, but we still get rust stains and rotten egg smell with the water, especially after it rains. That is to say, it's so bad that a good water treatment system doesn't get rid of it all.

We use a pur filter water pitcher. It may not get everything, but it definitely makes the water palatable. Without it the water tastes awful. Gets expensive, though...we have to replace the filter twice a often as recommended."

"2-3 ""fun size"" bars is easily enough per kid. Some houses will just give one. Also, you should leave your door closed and just watch t.v. or something. They will knock."
"~~Incorrect! That rule was put in place explicitly in 1974. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won their Nobel in 1962.~~

Edit: So, as pointed out below, it has been noted that posthumous awards were possible before 1974, but not posthumous nominations."
Lacoste Essential. Everyone wears Aqua di Gio and Abercrombie but those smell really good too.
Was about to reply this too. Imagine paying for bottled water. I only drink it when I get it for free from an event or something. I prefer a simple reusable bottle not because I’m some uwu environmentalist type but because I just like getting water without paying for it.
thank god i'm black
Thanks for clarifying that you’re not trying to pump the literal largest market cap companies on earth. I have to admit that was my suspicion.
"Some folks on this subreddit made [this wonderful guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3npea9QoEtCpQor8W25_VSJTgXuy6QgCEvt4FrHMvA/edit#gid=0). You can figure out what mAh value you need, and then compare weights and costs."
