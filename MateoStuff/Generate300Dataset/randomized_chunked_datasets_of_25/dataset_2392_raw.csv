Santal 33! I always get compliments when I wear it.
"I bought a sample pack online that came with 12 different samples for around $40. It let me try out some as a complete cologne newbie to see ones I liked and didn't like, without committing to a whole bottle. 

Also when I'm dating someone knew after a while we go through them together and pick out the ones she likes best. Different people have different preferences. And they can have associations to different scents depending if they knew someone else who used to wear it."
"Pre-med really isn't a major, though. Plenty of people with a BA or BS in psychology go on to medical school. Making sure you have the right pre-requisite courses is important. Any major can apply to medical school.

Your comments are highly insulting to psychiatrists and psychiatric care generally. Psychiatrists are physicians first, and they utilize their medical training in their daily practice. 

I work with many psychiatrists. I have seen them punched, screamed at by patients, and have seen firsthand the stressful nature of their work at times. Their work requires a high level of expertise, similar to other specialties within medicine. I think you should withhold making such comments without the experience and knowledge to back them up."
Disney and Universal parks were excluded.
Browns are the best all around switch. Good for your fist mech keyboard
"a friend of mine smokes before pooping.









He claims- no poop without smoke."
"Well yes, but time management is a prerequisite for productivity"
"LG 27GL850, or Asus VG279AQL1A"
"Totally agree with you, with a little helps of those budget app,  your financial house will be even in a better shape..."
"This comment reminded me, and briefly tortured me."
The calculator I really wanted. I had a favourite calculator in middle and high school that they stopped making by the time it broke and I used shitty calculators I didn't like after that. Halfway through my engineering degree I found one that had clearly been overstock that never got sold years ago (paid $40 for a $13 calculator) but I use it every day and it's a joy to be back with what I learned all my math on
So the perception that he's an immature moron is right on then.
"pretty sure all the dorms on campus have shared bathrooms

ft would be your best bet. the bathroom is shared between your room + the room next door the only downside is being off campus. ft is so far from campus but there’s a bus that takes u to campus"
"Padlocks are just to discourage petty, opportunistic theft. Most bags are made of fabric so can really be 'opened' with a sharp knife or pair of scissors."
"Try searching the paper title on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com). At the bottom of most result entries, there will be a link that says ""All # versions"", and a lot of those will be free."
Clearly.
"When I read through that quickly, I thought it said clean the house without being naked. 

Yeah."
Going for it. Thanks!
This is both accurate and funny.
"Best story on this thread- doesn’t involve jizz, poop, murder or suicide.

Edit: Thanks for the award! who knew spending way too much time reading hotel stories would pay off!"
"God damn it, my entire point is that this is only a matter of opinion. Opinions that inevitably lead to flame wars. It's a silly thing to debate online"
"Here's a few of my favorites, not just the place itself but my favorite items on the menu. I don't eat meat but I trust that most of these places that serve meat do it well:

Korean Chicken Sandwich at Modern Times  
Crispy Tofu Poke Bowl at Kanaloa Seafood  
Lunch Special (Slice, salad and drink) at Gino's Siclian Express  
Rascal's Burrito at Super Cucas on Micheltorena  
Kale & Brussels Salad + Fries at Creekside  
Spicy Edamame, Edamame Gyoza and Avocado/Cucumber Roll at Edomasa  
Zen Roll at Arigato Sushi"
"Same situation here. I waited about a year after the 6s release to pick it up and has been my very reliable daily driver until the new SE 2020 came out. I bought it immediately and did as you did and did a factory reset on the 6s and had the carrier unlock it. Now I use it as a remote for just about everything in my house. Gonna keep it handy in case a second phone is needed. As long as it’s getting OS updates, it’s worth keeping around."
"The question is whether the filter makes water *safer*, not safe. I'd guess that, in an emergency and with no other options, you'd be better off running water through a Brita filter than not. Would be interesting to know whether that's true though."
Both the new wayfarer and these come in a 55mm and a 52mm; I've tried the 52mm new wayfarer in store and the size seems pretty comparable to the 52mm gamma rays.
