33529,best electric car,"Yeah. I thought the video was very fair and interesting. Unfortunate to see that it's been downvoted to zero.

Ah, well, whatever.

TBH, I was *most* impressed by how well Porsche did."
6039,best programming language for web development,"i'm going to be a contrarian and mention c/c++ and assembly...at least on an arduino or other small embedded dohicky, if not on bigger metal like x64. also play around with linux enough to be familiar with how to use bash to string command line programs together.


in other words:

1: learn how computer works all the way down. you don't need to be an expert, but you should at *least* be familiar with memory addressing, the stack, pointers, registers, opcodes, and enough of the structure of c/c++ to be able to write your own file copy routine, search a file, fizbuzz, and fibonacci generator. ideally, you would write a web server, even if it's an extremely crappy one.


2. learn bash and complex command line things. understand *why* 'echo \*' does what it does, know your pipe, your redirections (including stderr), grep, vi (even if you don't like it or emacs), wc, curl, wget, sed, find, ssh, ping, nslookup and source control. i'm sure i'm missing a number, but it's late. knowing this stuff will seriously prevent you from reinventing the wheel or spending a crapton of time doing repetitive and boring work. oh, you should probably be familiar with regex.


bonus: learn sql to a level where you are comfortable talking about and implementing 3rd normal form, avoiding sequence scans, and creating both pk/fk constraints and indicies.


bonus: learn how to configure apache and other tools you use. 


you don't have to be an expert at all of these things, but having a more than passing relationship with them will make your life a hell of a lot easier as well as making you an *lot* more valuable than a simple js assembly line worker. besides, if you know enough about what your sysadmin, dba, etc do, it's easier to talk to them and they are more likely to work effectively and efficiently with you when you know sorta what it takes to do the things you are asking them to do."

69230,best major to study in college,"I would've liked to do a diabetes nursing specialism. Unfortunately you can't get a state loan for a second degree in the UK and the fees are now over £9000 per year. The avg wage for a nurse on the NHS is about £22k pa. If I could go back and do it at £3k fees I would.

Edit: Just had a look - looks like the NHS might pay the fees... this needs some serious thought."
