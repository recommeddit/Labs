What about Spotify playlists?
"Which version would you say is most secure and safe? Also, which has the most devs and is most constantly updated?"
To be honest most Distros I've used Steam worked right out of the box.
"Sounds to me like someone can’t admit developers are willingly supporting the creation of tools used for nefarious purposes. How many whistleblowers do you need, how many elections have to be interfered with by foreign money, and how many bad faith arguments do tech CEO’s need to peddle on Capitol Hill before you realize how destructive social media is without people actively policing it?


You’re supporting the idea of developers being Adolf Eichmann’s. “I was just doing my job.” Think about how pathetic that abdication of responsibility is."
"Witcher 3, Mass Effect 2, Dark Souls, 1 and 3, Red Dead Redemption 1. Could pay those games until the end of time."
"Thank you, this explains why I have poor service inside many buildings.  Cedar Park, Texas"
I loved my iPhone SE original too but finally had to bite the bullet and upgrade earlier this year. I went with the iPhone 12 mini which was the closest form factor without the silly curved screen like the second SE and other models had which I disliked. Couldn’t be happier my choice and the size was close enough to not be annoying. Price was only only sticking point but I reasoned if it lasts as long as my last iPhone it would be worth it. Time will tell if I made the right call I guess.
I'm watching west wing for the first time right now and it's really good
"I liked Last Crusade > Temple of Doom > Raiders

in that order"
That seems like a recipe for puking...  I like it.
"If you like Habitat, check out the classic Nonstop by Brian Aldiss. The whole time I was reading Habitat I felt like I was visualizing Nonstop."
"I watched season 1 in one sitting, it’s so good."
Well I’d say this year has been really well done. 2019 was a fuckin circus and 2020 was much improved. This is the best it’s ever been I think.

I would love to hear your thoughts on Fort and Stellar (and Beyond the Sun) if its ok :)  
Also why you found Oceans ""meh""  


I'm asking because they're on my wishlist!"
Madoka that high?! Wow!
[Papers We Love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) is another very good one on Github
"How are Seven and Inception plot twists? More like a shocking moment and an ambiguous ending, I wouldn't consider them twists at all."
this thread makes me want to invest in an RV
or screw DMX and just smoke or snort PCP. You can lift really heavy shit then. Past your limits? What limits?
"I have played The Witcher 3 actually, got about 30% in and got really really stuck. But could pick it up where I left off.

I have Fallout 4 also. :)

Not tried Diablo games.

Can you just jump on the band wagon so far into FF? Haha"
"Nestlé water actually tastes pretty good, but how it was obtained makes me not want it. Dasani and Aquafina are straight garbage though."
"I agree with this recommended, as a long time fan of the genre, it’s the best RPG game I’ve played in years. It scratched a big itch too, because there haven’t been any true RPGs released in a long time, we’ve been getting a lot of action RPGs instead and those just aren’t the same for me."
"audiobookbay.nl is up, using it right now."
