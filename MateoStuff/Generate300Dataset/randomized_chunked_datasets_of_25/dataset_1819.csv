29784,best money managing app,"That's kind of like asking why you have to buy food in order to cook...

Budgeting software, like all software, is a product.  Someone took the time to think of it, create it, develop it, and publish it, all of which costs time and money investments.  You, as the consumer of the product, pay to use the software the company developed, which is how the company pays the people who did/do all the work, and allows them to keep improving or create new products.

Some companies give away their products for free, but typically either the product is really bad, or they make money in other ways, either by showing ads (or selling you other services like mint.com does) or selling the content you create using their software (like facebook and reddit)."

29932,best money managing app,FYI. They respond really quickly if you contact them. I ask a question in a forum and they gave me a free month on top of the 4 month trail because it was an issue they couldn't fix right away.
16270,best sunglasses for fashion,"Very easy, I have [those](http://www.persol.com/usa/sunglasses/PO3132S/24-33) with prescription. What you do is you tell your shop to order those but in the optical (usually the models that are optical end in V, sun in S). If you order the sun it's fine, but you'll be paying extra. So you order the optical, and then you pay to get your prescription lenses tinted. It's around 50-100$ over regular lenses from experience.

Up here in Canada, not everyone carries Persol. The prices will change. Shop around. Get two-sided anti-reflection, it's worth it. I also have [those](http://www.persol.com/usa/sunglasses/PO3148S/9014-31) in one-sided anti-reflection, and hate to see my own eyelashes all the time."

29674,best game console,"For a Rhythm game, I´d throw in Project Diva f und f 2nd for the PS3 into the ring.

Yes, its insanely japanese (its basically guitar hero on Hatsune Miku and many many drugs), but a fun music game to pass the time and pretty much exclusive on the PS3/Vita.

EDIT: Also the near entire range of japanese RPG´s. You do not get many of them on the PC (just dropping the Tales of series, recent exclusives are Vesperia for 360 and Graces f, Xillia and Xillia 2 for the PS3)"

66499,best soccer team in the world,"Part of our 'decline' can be accredited to the change in our tactics and system over the last few months, I think we look better than before, yet our results are worse somehow. 

I've been hoping for a proper forward since Frei and Streller retired, it's the position we lack most besides wingers. Mehmedi and Gavranovic are shit, Seferovic is mostly shit, Embolo can't go to the grocery store without getting injured and promising players like Itten can't really get into the squad.

One thing that bugs me is the lack of passion some players seem to have (not talking about singing the hymn by the way, I wouldn't either).

Players like Senderos, Magnin, Spycher Lichtsteiner are on a different level than some of the planks walking on that pitch today. Surely we have more quality today, but we lack the players who would go through hell for the team."
22725,best celebrity,"You got donuts from Alan Rickman? Seriously? Man, I DO envy you!!"
73006,best Linux distro,"Some major Caveats:

\- The Arch Wiki is a great reference for users of any distro. Even when I was on Ubuntu, I referred to the Arch Wiki almost as much as I referred to Ubuntu (or Debian) documentation. This is true (for me) to a lesser extent with the Gentoo Wiki as well.

\- Some Distros (like Arch or Manjaro) have their community resources and communities centralized under one domain. Others (like Ubuntu) have different domains, for different pieces of the community (a domain for the main site, a domain for the forum, a domain for askUbuntu). This will heavily skew the numbers.

53675,best medicine for a cold,"Also, YSK that if you get sick and can't stop coughing (for more than the normal 1-2 weeks)/feel like something is in your throat, your illness may have triggered laryngopharingeal reflux. Happened to me a few years ago. Took multiple antibiotics and cough medicines unnecessarily.

Find an ENT, get scoped, don't waste time and $ on meds you don't need."
