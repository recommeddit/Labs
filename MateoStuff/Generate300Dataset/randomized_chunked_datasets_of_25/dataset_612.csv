38797,best web browser,"I was using Firefox, switched to Brave, from Brave to Edge, Edge to Opera GX, then after using all of these, Deleted them, came back to Firefox. Why? It is the Browser for me. It's Simple, easily Customizable and User Friendly than ALL the other Browsers. Brave is a good Alternative but for me Firefox is Better than it. Don't use Opera GX, it's known for Selling Browser History. Edge is very Average. Firefox's the Best currently. Try it out."
28357,best breakfast foods,"http://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/recipe-for-baked-oatmeal/

The recipe I've used is similar to this. I usual add different fruits and nuts. You can add more 
/different spices. I've also tossed in things like hemp seeds. I was thinking there was more than one egg but I was wrong... Unless I usually make a double batch... I haven't made it since last winter."

23192,best social networking site for CS,"I'll try my best to come up with alternate solutions for a while, but this sounds like a good 'plan B' if I end up running out of time.

What I present at the conference is up to me, there is no pressure. I just thought I'd do my best with the time I have.

What path would you suggest I take if there was no time constraint?"

60786,Best comedy show on Netflix,Dimitri Martin. His newest show literally had me laughing out loud for at least 70% of it. But all his shows are hilarious.
9419,best toothpaste,"It works! If you have a website to find listings, are willing to do a bit of research and don't mind negotiating a bit (I hate that part), you can save literally tens of thousands of dollars. Realtors are car salesmen and are completely redundant in this day and age"
9659,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Search bar my dude. Prob Anacapaca > Santa Cruz >= Santa Rosa > other dorms, if you want on campus. Ofc some people love FT, but some people don’t like it because of the distance. So opinions about FT (San Cat) can be pretty polarizing."
37366,best amusement park,"I’d disagree with Idaho. Northern Idaho is all about Silverwood, but SE Idaho, which has a larger population, barely realizes that it exists. South East Idaho is basically an extension of Utah, and everyone here loves Lagoon."
7230,best iPhone,"I came from a iPhone 7 maybe a month ago. Just go and buy it, don’t have how to compare it. Have an amazing camera, ridiculous battery, longevity, processor, a great big screen and I’m sure that the next iOS will be smooth, don’t worry about it"
