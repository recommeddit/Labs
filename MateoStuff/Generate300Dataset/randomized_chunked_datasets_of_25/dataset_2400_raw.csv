Buy the white ones and dye them yourself?
thats why you do your own research and not just listen to some wannabe on reddit..

What are my chances of finding Dior Sauvage & Creed Aventus at Costco?
"I think everyone should consider switching to [KY](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ky) at this point, unless they need to support upload progress. It's built on top of Fetch.

The switch from axios was painless for us. Axios has been unusable for months due to numerous issues."

MI Fallout is about as good as mainstream gets otherwise."
"I love the idea of a small fun electric car for around town shopping stuff, and a truck/suv for longer drives, more people, and towing toys."
"Will Fowler's *Santa Anna of Mexico* is by far the best English-language biography. For a good history of the Mexican-American War that gives a lot more attention to the Mexican side than most others, Peter Guardino's ""The Dead March"" is by far the best for that. I worked with Dr. Guardino on my Master's thesis, which was about the Mexican-American War.

John S.D. Eisenhower's ""So Far From God"" and K. Jack Bauer's ""The Mexican War"" are good military histories, but are of course Americentric. Most of the books covering the Mexican side of the war are, sadly for you perhaps, in Spanish."
"Anything that relates to your relationship with him that you can’t buy in a store. 

Something that you made like a painting, or a handwritten note, a picture that is prized by you both framed."

This community is amazing to do things like this
"Yes, Hulk the movie sucks. Hulk the character is great, as is Mark Ruffalo. I like him better than Norton, both in his early ""tortured soul super-genius"" mode and his later ""vaguely stonery comic relief"" style.

I went to SD Comic-Con in 2007, went to the Hall H presentation with RDJ and Ed Norton and Gwyneth Paltrow and I guess Kevin Feige was probably there although I had no idea who he was then.

At one point, someone asked Norton what his involvement behind the scenes of the movie was. He did a cute little ""aw shucks"" move, looked down at his shoes, and literally said ""I wrote the movie"". That is a direct quote, and I have not forgiven him for it."
"Ah, that's a bummer about Ichnusa! It's so beautiful--isn't it weird how one strange association can make you think differently about a scent? 

Fior Fiore made me reconsider pear. I'd always thought it was too sweet, but I was intrigued by a scent that emphasized the muskiness, rather than sweetness of pear. I think I prefer something greener (am testing Cartier's Carat which may be a contender) but Fiore is quite good and definitely one of my favorites from the recent pear trend."
