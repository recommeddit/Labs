I happen to be one of the people who loved it, but I can understand how people can not enjoy it, too. If you do like the enemies-to-lovers trope, is there a book that you think would have been a good addition to the list? (Im always looking for recs!) 

I think with the Milan books, not as many people associate her with the contemporary books she has written. I know I personally constantly forget she has written them because her historical are so prevalent in my mind. I really should read the Cyclone series, though...",best romantic novel

15506,"There are several nice evergreen trees that are hardy in your zone. You could plant evergreen Magnolia, Christmas Holly, Eucalyptus neglecta/gunnii or train Cherry laurel as a tree.

My personal favorite though would be Loquat. It has large, broad, evergreen leaves and if the trees are old enough or grafted, a pleasantly smelling bloom. It also has the Award of Garden Merit by the RHS and if you are lucky and the winters are mild enough, you might even get fruit off of it. For that reason I would get a self-fertile, late-ripening fruit variety to increase your chances (such as Tanaka).

I can also vouch for the very nice smell of Cherry laurel flowers.",best tree for the garden
