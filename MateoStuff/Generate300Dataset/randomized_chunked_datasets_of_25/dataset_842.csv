52755,"I can’t imagine not putting a Kanye album on the list. Despite whatever political bullshit is going on and the boycotting, hip hop has been evolving rapidly and Kanye has constantly made incredible albums through the times. As much as I love “Ye”, I’m not gonna say that a project that’s been out is a classic, but MBDTF would easily be on there. 

Run The Jewels would have to have an album on here for me. I would struggle between 2 or 3. 

Get Rich or Die Tryin was a major curve in hip hop. That was the first true gangster rap since the 90’s

33620,"If you're driving less than 40 miles per day, you can get away with a 120V charger. But, as others have pointed out, a Level 2 charger just plugs into a dryer/stove/RV outlet so it's usually not a big deal.

If you don't plan on road tripping any time soon, then pretty much any EV will work well. The Spark EV is hilariously torquey. The e-Golf is well-polished. The Soul EV is underrated.

If you want to go on the occasional road trip, then things get tricky. If you look hard enough, you can find a Bolt under $20k. The Ioniq's efficiency and charge speed put it on the ""road trippable"" list, too.

For my money, the best EV under $20k would be a 2015 BMW i3 REx for $16k. It might look like the south end of a northbound bulldog, but it's delightfully quick, handles like a mini cooper, and the optional range extender engine can buy you a country getaway or two.",best electric car
