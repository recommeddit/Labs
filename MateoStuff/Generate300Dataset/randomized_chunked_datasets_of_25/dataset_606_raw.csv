"For a throw-back, Lost World type of read, try The First Men In The Moon."
"To be honest, I've never even heard of that one! But I feel like it'd be odd to bring back an ice cream based off a film from almost ten years ago? And I don't remember seeing this ice cream on the ""upcoming"" list! Guess I missed out."
"So out of all the 1440p, 27"" IPS G-Sync monitors out there, which one has the highest Adobe RGB color gamut, lowest amount of backlight bleed, and best customer service for replacements (in case of backlight bleed)?"
"For single text documents, Notepad++. Anything more complex I switch to an IDE."
"Ugh.. It's so bad right now. They don't even give an estimate shipping time.

"1. Twilight Imperium  -Because fuck casual gaming. I want to bring people round and show them a crazy time.

2. Game of Thrones / Diplomacy  -People should lose friendships at my house.

3. Catan - I am a traditionalist.

5. Scythe - So your smart friends get a turn at having no fucking clue what is happening.

6. Avalon - Find out who the biggest asshole you know is.

7. Codenames - Because you can't always predict how many players you will have.

8. Love Letter - You can bring it and play it anywhere

9. Space Alert - Playing together is only fun if you lose most of the time.

10. Dungeons and Dragons - Why stop at just board games?"

season 2 was terrible.
"1. {Princess Trap by Talia Hibbert}

2. {The Duchess Deal by Tessa Dare}

3. {Serving Pleasure by Alisha Rai}

4. {Wicked and the Wallflower by Sarah MacLean}

5. {Band Sinister by KJ Charles}

This was hard! I tried not to repeat authors (or Talia Hibbert would be most of the list)."
