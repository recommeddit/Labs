"Hi there! This post is incredibly timely, as I am in the market for a new laptop.

I have not owned a personal computer in about five years, as I have relied on my company laptop for everything. I will no longer have this computer in the near future as I am leaving the company, so I will need a new computer soon.

My current computer is some sort of Dell Latitude. 

As you mentioned in your post, this computer is for general use for streaming videos, browsing, and lots of Excel. I don’t anticipate much gaming as I’m more of a console player, and I don’t work in any sort of graphic design or music-production related field. 

As for budget, I don’t really know what to expect. I’m certainly not looking for the lowest price range, but equally I’m not sure I can justify $1,300+ for a computer. I received the $600 stimulus check this morning, so let’s say that I’m willing to spend a little more for higher quality. 

I’ve browsed the table on your site which is very nicely laid out, but I’m kinda lost on what I should be looking for. 

Wondering if you’d be able to help me out."

"Be hardcore, go through the entire site, then come back to reddit. That's what I did."
"We just had thunderstorms rip through last week, something like 700,000 people were without power for 3-4 days. Luckily, my lights stayed on. But many friends and coworkers didn't, and fridges got emptied and thrown away, etc. 

If something like that happened with a Lightning in the driveway, I could keep everything running for a week, and that's without popping over to a public charging station (all of which did keep power or had it quickly restored) to top up and bring a fresh ""tank"" of electricity back to the house."
"If you wanted you could get the 27"" Oddysey g7 for $100 more and get 240hz instead of 144hz."
I didnt think so
"Incredibly safe. A lot of misconceptions revolve around hacking, websites selling data, or websites being compromised. You're more likely to get your information stolen by someone virtually ""watching"" your keystrokes (as in a keylogger, or a similar family of malware) than the website messing up."

Never knew what those horrid things were called. Thank you.
"I don't ""like"" that he did this to you, but boy, this is a helluva great response."
"Depends entirely on the business. Where I'm at, you'd need C#/Asp.net/SQL. Somewhere else you'd need Java, somewhere else Python/JS."
For the greatuh good!
"Not sure if you're interested in development and the like, but I used to listen to a pretty cool embryology podcast. I can try and find it if you're interested. 

If you just want some supplemental information or a refresher on stuff like DNA rep, cell division, etc, Khan Academy has videos."
Don't. Stop.
"Activated carbon can grow bacteria and develop biofilms.  It doesn't need to be ""full."" When the carbon is full it simply stops adsorbing contaminants and just becomes a filter media, at that point it is not doing what you want it to do and is pretty useless because it isn't a particularly good filter media on its own.

I will say there are filters that make use of biological growth to beneficially treat water, but it is not something you want to do on your own at home."
"That's cool, good luck when you get to college and Prof won't allow it."
"Heh. Bunch of people that like to think they are very tolerant, but are basically racist. The government is slowly destroying the healthcare and education systems, but no one seems to care. And if you don't fit the body shape of the Dutch (tall and broad, both men and women) you cannot shop for affordable clothes anywhere."
"Like I said, enjoy getting busted."
