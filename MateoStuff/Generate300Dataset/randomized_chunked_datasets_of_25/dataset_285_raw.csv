"Rotring 600, in 0.7 mm. By far the best mechanical pencil that I have even experienced. Hands down.

For about 20 years I've used 0.5 mm mechanical pencils such as Pentel, and I was satisfied with them.  But switching over to Rotring was unbelievable.  It really surprised me how easy it was to write with it.  It seems weird to say that -- I mean, it is just a mechanical pencil, so I was surprised how surprised I was, as well.  

I am not sure why I strongly prefer Rotring over the various other mechanical pencils that I've used in the past.  Maybe it is the feel of the solid construction.  Maybe it is the metal cut grip.  Maybe it is that it has very little play.  Maybe it is its high weight.  

I switched from 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm and from HB (No. 2) to B (No.1) lead, and that may have also made a big difference.  

Any downsides? Well, it does not have a retractable point like many of the high-end mechanical pencils, so you cannot put in your pocket.  It needs to remains on your desk or in some carrying case.  If you want the retractable point, you'd have to get the Rotring 800."
What colour to paint your fuck off with.
Literally better than Cold War lol
It was a while back now but vaguely remember some witches and a cave possibly. I’ll buy it second hand and it should pick up where I left off

"Yeah GTA 3 was the one that defined the entire franchise and had an enormous impact on the open world genre that is still felt to this day. SA, while a technical achievement and a significant refinement of the formula, just can’t make those same claims."
It is IPL season. Why you posting about Tests? That format has been killed by COVID for sure.
I got the phillips sonicate for around $40. Went from my dentists being on me about my plaque buildup to saying I've been doing a good job. Its on a timer that buzzes everytime you need to change quadrants in your mouth and you don't have to guess how long you've been brushing.
"I use mine for drawing and matte just feels better than a glass protector. 

I do watch streamers on twitch a lot and I don’t see a real problem where i’d need to switch protectors to watch a video."

"Last year was our first Christmas as a blended family. I got my bonus mom a reindeer family ornament with all of our names on it. My dad and her make such a wonderful match, and I wanted her to know that we are happy to be a blended family with her and my step siblings. Not expensive, but she loved it. I think she might have teared up."
"My understanding is that 'useful' degrees are those that generally result in a job upon graduation, such as(at least in my country):

Medicine, law, teaching, accounting, engineering, IT

As opposed to those degrees which have little job prospect and a surplus of students or are not specialised."
I love how Russia beat Spain (#6) and is still #39 while America didn’t make the World Cup and is #22.

2nd for American Optical. Love mine. Bought a second pair because Poseidon took my first pair when I wore them in the ocean.

Didn't Triclosan just come under fire for not being proven to actually kill bacteria?
