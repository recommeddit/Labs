"For me at least, the players I've introduced are coming from playing mostly Euro games, so I think having that softer onboarding in 18Ches and 1846/1889 really helps. And really, you can still really get yourself in trouble in all three of the aforementioned games, just not the ultra sharp knives of some other titles."

"u/stetsdogg, can you go through and check that TRUE and FALSE are all caps or all lowercase? When I try and do some filtering, they are being treated as different, and can't seem to select multiple TRUE or FALSE. I could be wrong, but this is my first time experiencing Airtable."
"Extended answer:

Music notation is basically set up for piano. The notes are all in a row, every octave played the same as the last, most people even refer to the staves as left hand and right hand, because that's how you would generally approach it with a piano. A piano isn't just some instrument, like a saxophone, or a ukulele, it's a logical tool set up to play music, so it fits naturally with notation. It's like the predecessor to MIDI and recorded music, it was the best way to get all of those notes in with a single person. 

You also wont need to build calluses for piano, or spend 15 years getting your picking hand accurate and fast, no painful muting technique practice, you get to sit down on stage, you generally have a wider range of pitches, you have a fuckload more options when it comes to close harmony and wide intervals, general harmony and polyphony, you can even bend pitches on many keyboards, as well as accessing a wide range of timbres, you will likely learn notation immediately(rather than learning guitar tab and then trying to learn notation), and because notation is set up so logically it will help you learn theory faster. 

There are few things it can't do in relation to other instruments, but when it can, or can e manipulated to do so easily then other instruments are basically pointless. 

If instruments were used for cooking rather than music you could use matches, or rub sticks together, or hold it closer to the sun, but the piano is like an oven, it is scientifically designed to be the best device for its purpose so far."
"If you happen to enjoy reading fiction, you should check out The Magus by John Fowles. It is the novel that the script for The Game was supposedly ripped off from. (I would have to agree) The setting is completely changed but the mindfuckery is crazy."

"About Tennessee: 

Nashville has a great nightlife for tourists. Just go down to Broadway and there are plenty of honky-tonks and other various bars with live music. There's also amazing restaurants. 

There used to be Opry Mills Mall, but that was destroyed in the recent flood. I think they'll eventually get around to rebuilding it, but maybe not in the timeframe when they would be here. Otherwise, there's the Green Hills Mall which is about ten minutes from downtown."
