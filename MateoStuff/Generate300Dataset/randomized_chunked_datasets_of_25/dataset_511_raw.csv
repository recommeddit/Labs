"Oh god buddliea can grow massive. My neighbour has one - it is now almost as tall as the house. I have to prune my side heavily about twice a year and it's a massive pain in the arse as it grows very rapidly in all directions (annoyingly, mostly towards my minidish).

In summer it shades out my garden plants, however it's not that effective at screening."
"The ""all grown up"" thing in the Daily Mail is really quite disturbing. Why do they think a 14 year old is grown up? And then they have the audacity to get all high and mighty about perverts and the like. The Media Blog writes quite a bit about the Daily Mail http://www.themediablog.co.uk/the-media-blog/2013/01/the-daily-mail-all-grown-up.html"
I got Dylan Blue from my wife and son for Father’s Day a few years back.  I thought it was pretty clever since my sons name is Dylan.  Turns out it is a terrific cologne.

I just had laser eye surgery and the first 2 weeks of recovery my eyes were super sensitive to contrast. This extension ensured that I could continue redditing for 7 hours a day in my underwear.

That is absolutely gorgeous. House we are buying has paintable walls only in laundry where it would look weird. Sad I can’t use it.

"I tried to do an AID course in PA. Only got 3 jumps in the course of a month. I then went to Lodi. I was able to get 20mins of tunnel time coached, my AFF and a working tandom for 1300. They will push you through it fast, and personally I like that. I want to get my jumps in quick so that I don't lose anything from the last jump. I had a uspa certified aff instructor that was awesome. All their gear is brand new, one of the larger landing areas, and it was way too spot the dz. It might not be for everyone, but I continue to go back."

"Santa Barbara Pizza always gets overlooked.  It's a good, solid, cheap pizza.

You want something a bit extra?  Calzone from Rosas.  Artichoke, mushroom, garlic, basil, with marinara sauce and a side of putanesca sauce."
"Gonna piggyback off this comment since I also use Acqua di Gio:

Compliments on fragrance are as much about the person and their relationship to you as it is about the smell.

Ever had someone say ""Oh that's a nice shirt"" despite it being one you've worn dozens of times before? Or ""Hey I like your haircut"" even though it's the same style you always get?

People who are close to you (or friendly strangers) will decide first (maybe subconsciously) that they want to pay you a compliment, and then will pick up on something noticeable. That shirt, your hair, how you smell.

Despite all the comments I read on here and countless other websites about being complimented by total strangers on how you smell, I have never had a single unsolicited compliment on any of my fragrances. 

I have AdG, 1 Million, Le Male, all the top 'compliment getters'. I don't own them for that reason, but IMO there's no such thing as a fragrance that will get you compliments. It's a combination of your personality, the other person's personality, and the social situation you're in. Your fragrance just happens to stand out more as a 'thing to be complimented on' compared to your shirt or your haircut etc."

"Except for being so inexpensive as to be nearly disposable, making it perfect for automation/simple computation projects. 

I remember reading some futurist book about how one day we'd go to the convenience store and ""pick up a 10-pack of computers"" and found the idea laughable at the time, but goddamn...the Pi comes pretty close."
