62472,Best RPG game on PS4,"It certainly leans more action than RPG, but it does have a ton of equipment/skills to craft/collect/upgrade."
66008,best college in california,Very weird to see. SB was seen as a party school when I was applying to college 10 years ago. I was near the top of my class and barely got into SD.
11764,best gifts for dad,"*Dad sits down at the kitchen table and dumps out his bag of coins.*

53359,best usb c charging cable,"> I am quite torn whether OP is spam

With all due respect, I think my post history speaks adequately to the matter, unless you and I happened to have different definitions of the word ""spam"".

I wouldn't have thought that a post with five different brands listed with target prices, and a nice clean layout, would have been eyed with suspicion. I see now that there are Amazon links on it, which I wouldn't have noticed before but wouldn't have cared about if I had. I also haven't seen this domain before now, linked or otherwise, so I thought there wouldn't be any perception of repeated content being posted from it. I guess I was wrong on two counts?

Going in, I had good opinions about two of the units (Plugable and IOGear), moderately positive about two of them (Cable Matters and Necktek), and no opinion or slight reservations about one of them (Veckle), but those aren't based on personal testing. I was rather hoping the subreddit would have some good feedback. I think I'm moderately more likely to buy one of the Cable Matters cables than I was before reading the list.

I've bought from Monoprice over the last ten years and they're fine, but I'm not particularly attached to the ""Monoprice"" brand (nor the ""Amazon Basics"" branding) and the price spread from ordering directly from East Asia has gone down steadily over the years. If I can get cables that I like better in construction, aesthetics, or brand, for equal or slightly more than Monoprice, I'm currently going to get the others -- assuming they're all compliant with standards and otherwise equal. Speaking of equal, I think the Plugable might have a lower wire gauge, even though I'm overall partial toward the brand."
20076,best workout music,"Send a frickin' letter,  then.   To your MTV or some such."
55572,best action and adventure novel series,"The Kardashian comparison doesn't make sense as ""an observation"" either."
12760,best gifts for mom,"My fiance says we aren't having girls. I'm pretty sure that's just challenging the universe, and we'll end up with 4 girls. His reply is that if we do have girls, they aren't leaving the house until they're 30... I think he is terrified of a daughter encountering the teenage version of himself."
73289,best Linux distro,"Check which software you need for your studies and if the latest versions are important to you. Basically all popular Linux distros are fine. But these 2 points are the deciding factors.

Probably your choices are ultimately Fedora or Ubuntu (or any of its derivatives). But trying these 2 out will help you further.

Fedora was excellent for my IT studies but also for my workstation at work. It's very stable, runs relatively the latest software, super secure (SELinux, secure boot, excellent hardening, minimal install by default, maintained by Red Hat).

And don't worry about long term support. Open-source software is going fast. It's not strange to upgrade your operating system to a major release every 6 months. The key thing is if you can do these upgrades without reinstalling. And with Fedora and Ubuntu (and basically all Linux distros, you can)."
4721,best home improvement store,"This. I use Lowe's, Home Depot, & Menard's all regularly for different things and different sales. Lowe's site to store really sucks in my area, but you can buy those coupons on Ebay & get some major savings on big purchases."
47928,best color to paint with,"I just haven't had the luck with color & lighting replication, like I have with Behr on my last/final painting round. 6 years ago I repainted with Valspar & was so upset with the product & outcome, but it was all I could afford. My house looked like the ultra budget-off brand version, of the off brand product I was using. 

After raising my budget 3 years later, I switched to Sherwin. Although not an enjoyable outcome, it was acceptable for the time. My poor experiences could've been due to poor staff training or unclean machinery. I wouldn't have put it past the 'Standards' of my whale-mart soo..
Sherwin is great for industrial/non-personal/general application though!"

57467,best water brand,"Nestle has this strange taste which I find the worst, Dasani has this interesting bitter taste which I'd rather prefer since it tastes unique but I know that it's going to be mentioned as the worst brand in the comments haha."

18782,best YouTube video,So Alan Partridge.
22062,best celebrity,"Bam Margera. Back when Jackass was a thing and I was in middle school in about 2003 he had a signing at the local mall and my mom and I waited in line for about four hours so I could meet him. I had him sign a pair of skate shoes that I was wearing to school with the fat shoe laces that I put into a checkerboard pattern. He took about ten minutes to talk to me and compliment me on how cool that was and ask how I did it. 

Meanwhile at school, all of the skateboarders made fun of me for wearing skate shoes and constantly gave me grief. Having a celebrity who I really looked up to give me such high praise saved my self esteem for the rest of middle school. Being nice is easy, but Bam Margera went above and beyond."
54726,best water filter,"Yeah. That's the one I have. I actually got a pitcher filter to filter the water first, then put THAT water through the ZW. It's tripled the life span of my big blue box's filters. I have to refill it a lot because the buns drink plenty of water, but as long as I remember to refill it immediately after using it, I never have a problem with running out.

The problem I have with it is I get mildew growing in the top part which gets into the filter and spoils it. I wish it was made of microban or something. As it is I have to take it apart and clean it almost daily because the mildew just keeps coming back."

31011,best country to live in,"> Would you disagree?

Yes. But then I'm a US citizen. I found it very difficult to break into British and European social groups simply because of my 'otherness'. But I have made good friends in both places."
