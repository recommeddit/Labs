23199,"Well first thing you should know is that 80 days is almost certainly not long enough to learn enough to make a secure website and that any live product hosting real data has a moral obligation to keep its users' data as secure as possible. It looks like you already understand that it's going to be a huge task, but I don't think you really understand the scale. For reference, I consider myself a fairly experienced web developer, I've built dozens of sites from scratch, many being quite complex (tens of thousands of lines of PHP going into the back-end). Realistically, I don't think I could get a full-fledged social media site that is secure, fast, mostly bug-free, and looks good all in 80 days. Sure, I could do it if I put in 8-hours a day, but it would still be tough and I don't need to go through the trouble of learning how to do it as I go. I am not going to say you can't accomplish this (I don't know you, for all I know you could be a webdev prodigy), but I will say that I will be surprised if you succeed. Why is it that you need to not hire a freelancer? If it's a matter of pride, I understand but this is a tough job and you might have to bite the bullet if you have made serious promises.

That being said, if you already have some Javascript experience, I recommend using that through-and-through. Look into the MEAN stack (good introduction video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEE7DY2AYvI). Try to use as much third-party code as you can (don't forget to check licenses) to minimize the workload on yourself.",best social networking site for CS

17291,"**Classics**: 

[Hyper Light Drifter Special Edition](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyper-light-drifter/id1453875289) ($4,99)  
The Hyper Light Drifter by Heart Machine that we all know and love, but with extra content: locations, weapons and challenges. Supports controllers (MFi, PS4 and Xbox) - if you feel like touch screen doesn't give the precision you want, this usually helps. :) The game also plays awesome on Apple TV. (Console experience, mobile price!)  
**Retro with a twist:** 

[Cursed Castilla](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cursed-castilla/id1468871893) ($3,99)  
This is where Medieval Spain meets classic retro arcade gameplay.   
A demon used tears of a young witch to release the evil from hell. Knight Don Ramiro is tasked with kicking the evil out of Tolomera. You'll meet all kinds of creatures from European folklore, many of which you had no idea about! Apple TV? Of course!  
   
[The Curse of Issyos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-curse-of-issyos/id1500724078) ($2,99)  
Off to Ancient Greece! Defkalion was fishing at the calm blue sea, when Goddess Athena told him the Isle of Issyos has been cursed by the Olympus! Defkalion heads back home to save his only daughter, Delia. A creative take on retro arcade gameplay + Ancient Greek mythology. Slightly more forgiving than our other retro titles. :) Got it on iPhone/iPad - it's already on your Apple TV!   
[Super Hydorah](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-hydorah/id1348224049) ($4.99)   
Space shoot'em up, anybody? The star of Omios has been infested with Meroptians, very unfriendly biomechanical creatures. And yes, only you, the best spaceship pilot of the Universe, can free the star. Will you?   
If you like Gradius, R-Type, Darius... you'll love Super Hydorah. Even more with a controller on Apple TV!

**For the busy players (short and immersive):** 

[Mindkeeper - The Lurking Fear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindkeeper-the-lurking-fear/id1473252201) ($1,99)  
The game originally developed for the Apple Watch, now also showcased at Apple Stores worldwide (if you happen to go to one - please send us a pic! ;))   
It's a Lovecraftian horror puzzle adventure with very short but immersive levels and one-finger control on all platforms: Apple Watch (Digital Crown), iPhone/iPad (touch screen) and Apple TV (Siri remote). You play as investigator H. Joyce exploring a mansion deep in the Swamp of Storms to reveal the secret of the lurking fear.
