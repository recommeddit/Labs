"i really liked the song at the end of episode 9, and found it on youtube...

[Dan Deacon “When I Was Done Dying”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuJqUvBj4rE)
 
and I thought it was a cool coincidence bc everything in Dark is based on a 33 year cycle, and theres a moment when the video shows [the number 33](https://i.imgur.com/cXJDpCV.png)...

for no apparent reason mind you, and its the only number you see in the entire video. 

but then the more I watched it the more I started to think that the entire show is actually inspired by this song and video, which predates their pitch to Netflix by 2 years. 

**NOTE: WHAT IM ABOUT TO WRITE IS MOSTLY WILD SPECULATION BUT THERE ARE SOME MILD SPOILERS AHEAD, SO TAP OUT NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW** 

this doesn't even begin to cover everything, but the similarities literally start instantly, the very first thing you see or hear in the video and show is a rustling wind. after that both stories center around going into (and through) a cave, which sends you through time. 

at one point in the video he's returned back to now, but before that his face is ""wiped off"" and he says ""without ears I couldn't hear"", much like the kids with their eyes burned off and ear drums destroyed, and then it all ends with a massive explosion which essentially resets everything back to ""normal"". 

again, there's a lot more to it than what I listed here, its 3:17am on the west coast right now, I don't even know why Im awake and on here, but I think the producers actually wanted people to know this. 

if you just sorta mindlessly listen to the music, its pretty upbeat and fun imo, which does not fit the show AT ALL, especially not the scenes it was played over. its like they were practically begging people to notice it."
Last of the Mohicans and Waterworld. I go back to rewatch them at least once a year.
"There's only one editor that makes you facepalm weekly?  lol

But yeah, I agree that the paper's pretty good (for local issues) and the free *Times* issues are a sweet deal."
"Let me see if I can dig one up. The stands are currently in my basement lol since i got to keep 'em since I paid for the materials. (Total cost $20)

I have a pic somewhere though. 

Here we go. Apologies for the mess lol.

I have the Nano and it is good but my only complaint is that the prongs don't fold in.
They're not around here. 84 Lumber is consistently higher than Lowe's Depot.
"Hahaha just my personal taste I guess. My wife loves the characters and the show but to me all the characters seemed too one-dimensional. 

Luke - I'm a grumpy grump who serves food grumpily and I grumpily love Lorelai in the most grumpily obvious way possible creating an artificial ""will-they-or-won't-they tension in which everybody knows they will (I assume, like I said I just watched till season 2ish, but I would be surprise if the writers gave the audience blue balls for much longer than that) 

Lorelai - defines herself through her hatred of her parents even though she is 30 not 16. Is so incredibly self-centered that she never thinks her actions through and only looks at how things will effect her or her precious daughter who she can only see as a living saint. (casually leaving her fiancé with no consequence and flipping out on Jess after the car wreck are two good examples of why I hate Lorelai) She also has this ""hipster"" kinda attitude, if I can say that word without being accused of hipster-hating, where if you don't love all the pop-culture things she does then you have wasted your life and aren't worth her time. But really no one is worth her time because she is self centered.

Rory - Terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE girlfriend. I get that Dean is about as compelling as a soggy sock but she was horrible if I remember correctly. Also I know that she is only 16 but she acts so mature everywhere else it just doesn't fit well to act like a toddler toward boys. Also the ""I'm a super genius high schooled shtick"" became irritating fast. Really? You read the complete works of Henrik Ibsen over the weekend and want to pepper your conversations with allusions to The Iliad and obscure TV shows that were on the air when your grandma was in diapers? Sounds like every lovable highschooler I know...

Wow, I am ranting and coming across as a little Luke-ish myself. I love that others love the show, it's just not for me. Sorry :S"

"Mare of East Town was a great show. Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses.

I am one of the very few that didnt get into The Wire. I watched 2 episodes & that was enough.
But i do love Dominic West (the Affair) that's why i went to the Wire."
"Weren’t Tristan and Khloe broken up at the time? I wonder why it’s okay for Kendall and Kylie’s friend Sofia to be dating Scott, but Jordyn is being treated like a traitor (unless, of course, they weren’t broken up)."
"This is absolutely fantastic. I just love the art style. You can almost taste Piglet, yourself."

"There's been a definite trend towards RPGification of many different game genres ever since 1996, when RPGs suddenly became popular outside of Asia. I agree that they could use more strict definitions."
