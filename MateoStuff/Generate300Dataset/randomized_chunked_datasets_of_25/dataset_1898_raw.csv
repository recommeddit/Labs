"I love Julia Quinn’s The Bridgerton Series! My favorite is Romancing Mister Bridgerton. Also (not part of the series), The Secret Diary of Miss Miranda Cheever.

If you like angst/romance (that heart-clenching feeling!!!!), I recommend Again the Magic by Lisa Kleypas. :)"
You'll laugh your arm off
"I've never even seen Polo Red but I can say Polo Black is pretty good, do you know how they compare?"

"I can lurk no more.. 'We' published in 1924 by Yevgeny Zamyatin needs to be in this thread some where! It's the grandaddy of dystopian sci-fi and was a major influence on Orwell and Huxley.  A great read, check it out!

Man! I'm not going to let you poison me.  You must think I'm a [joke](http://www.hulu.com/watch/99944/saturday-night-live-digital-short-on-the-ground#s-p1-sr-i2)!
"I came to post the 7 days to a week comment, but I'll piggy back and expand on yours.  Jewish penicillin  is the way to go.  I make a big batch using a whole chicken, veg, noodles and 4 to 5 times as much garlic and black pepper as you would think to use. 

This will keep you hydrated, fed, and open up the sinuses like draino. Pretty tasty too."
"There are zillions of online resources for this that will give you good exposure to various technologies, from 101 and advanced. Spend some time w some basic tutorials, get a feel for what might interest you, then dig deeper. 

In the end, you're going to have to work hard, there are no shortcuts, only better routes. No one is a natural and just nails math, or anything else, they work at it. Get some late night focus sessions going, make it important to you, find your growth mindset. It's all up to you, no one else is going to make it happen. Want your 6 figures? Go get 'em."
"Hey man, question about palming the XM1, how is it? I currently am palming a viper ultimate but want a little bigger hump"
The Witcher 3. Imo the best story. The world is also gorgeous. The controls might feel a little wonky for some but I didn't think they were bad at all.

It plays in background and i can set playback speed. That is all what i want.

Tip: if you are listening to a audiobook with more than one chaper and have multiple files, make a playlist. It is one time process and free you from navigating file manager each time you want to listen tothe book."
"Kelly Clarkson. The southern charm thing isn't an act. Coincidentally I also met the meanest celebrity the same night, Avril Lavigne. 

Shout out to Blink-182 as well, in my short time working with celebrities, they were the only ones I was actually a huge fan of and they were super cool as well, Mark Hoppus especially.

EDIT: Also now that I think about it, Gym Class Heroes were super cool as well.  Their singer was an especially nice guy."
