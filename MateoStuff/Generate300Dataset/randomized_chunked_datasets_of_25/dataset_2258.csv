17563,"I'm surprised no one said Among Us yet. 

So if you're a fan of murder mystery, or the movie ""The Thing"", then you'll love this one. It's a game where you work with a group of 5-10 people, and try to complete as many tasks as possible. However, one (or three depending on the game settings), is an imposter and he/she is trying to kill everyone to win. They can sabotage tasks, kill people, and do whatever possible so that the other survivors cannot win. 

Try it out, it's free and I got addicted the first 5 minutes of it. You'll love it.",best iOS game

I'm just curious then why you would recommend a Bluetooth over it.",best headphones
72419,"Depends on what you like. Liners provide a smooth feel, tactile can give you response based on actuation, and clicky over that heightened with audible feedback (useless if headphones are being used). 


Actuation force matters too. If you press lightly or don't wrest your fingers on your keys, lighter switches like Gateron White are great. If you're lightly wresting your hands, Cherry or Gateron Red switches are great, as are Cherry Speed, which require the same weight as Cherry Red, but have a higher actuation distance (about 0.7mm), so they have less travel before the stroke reads. If you are heavier in your strokes, or like wresting your hand on the keys, Gateron Yellows or Blacks can be great since they require more force. 


I myself use Gateron Yellows, a linear switch with about 50cN of required force. They feel super smooth and are easy to push, but not so easy that I mispress by wresting my fingertips.",best keyboard switches
