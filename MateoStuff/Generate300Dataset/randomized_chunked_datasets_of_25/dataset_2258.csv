68493,best science fiction novel,I hated Hyperion. It was bloated and emotionless.
33253,best electric car,I have solar. But really you wouldn't. In a power outage you could run your house for a few days (at least essentials) and then once the power came back on could charge your truck from the grid.

17563,best iOS game,"I'm surprised no one said Among Us yet. 

So if you're a fan of murder mystery, or the movie ""The Thing"", then you'll love this one. It's a game where you work with a group of 5-10 people, and try to complete as many tasks as possible. However, one (or three depending on the game settings), is an imposter and he/she is trying to kill everyone to win. They can sabotage tasks, kill people, and do whatever possible so that the other survivors cannot win. 

Try it out, it's free and I got addicted the first 5 minutes of it. You'll love it."
69686,best major to study in college,"It's weird to see this concept as an European mechie, but we have a different problem with mech engineering as such. Picking a wrong specialization results in less job opportunities than literature graduates."
14562,best romantic novel,"Artistic License by Elle pierson. It's got the following: 

Not your standard ""hot guy"" hero, he's rather conventionally ugly, but our heroine finds him fascinating. 

Sculptor heroine. As a sculptor myself, finding one represented in fiction thrills the heck outta me- so rare! 

An intriguing secondary plot that doesn't overtake the main plot or bog it down.

New Zealand setting

An overall feeling of sweetness 

Just.. worth a read. ðŸ’–"

2797,best headphones,"Ok thanks, I've just been reading that Bluetooth still has compression with aptX HD or aptX LL, with lower delays for LL but it still doesn't come near in terms of audio quality compared to a 2.4 ghz USB dongle connection? I'm just curious then why you would recommend a Bluetooth over it."
72419,best keyboard switches,"Depends on what you like. Liners provide a smooth feel, tactile can give you response based on actuation, and clicky over that heightened with audible feedback (useless if headphones are being used). 


Actuation force matters too. If you press lightly or don't wrest your fingers on your keys, lighter switches like Gateron White are great. If you're lightly wresting your hands, Cherry or Gateron Red switches are great, as are Cherry Speed, which require the same weight as Cherry Red, but have a higher actuation distance (about 0.7mm), so they have less travel before the stroke reads. If you are heavier in your strokes, or like wresting your hand on the keys, Gateron Yellows or Blacks can be great since they require more force. 


I myself use Gateron Yellows, a linear switch with about 50cN of required force. They feel super smooth and are easy to push, but not so easy that I mispress by wresting my fingertips."
30744,best country to live in,"In the US, a ton is 2,000 lbs.  You are using a metric tonne.  We even have an expression where we say ""metric ton"" as an exaggeration because it is more than a standard US ton."
