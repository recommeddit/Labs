22454,"I had Nick Hogan, Hulk Hogan's son, for a client at my business about 10 years ago. The kid gets a bad rap. For being so young, he was very professional, understood the business we were doing, and was impeccably polite.

After working with Nick for about two years, he stopped by my office one day and the Hulkster walked in with him. I did a happy dance on the inside, but played it cool on the outside. Hulk just kind of hung around our lobby while Nick and I had a brief 10 minute meeting.

When I walked Nick out of my office, he introduced me to his dad, Hulk Hogan. I shook hands with Hulk and said it was nice to meet him. Like Nick, he was super nice.

Nick kind of looked at me, smiles, and says, ""You want a picture with my dad?"" Remembering which of them was my actual client, I said, ""Really, I'd like a picture with both of you if it's okay!""

And that's how I got a picture of me with Nick Hogan on my right and Hulk Hogan on my left.",best celebrity

My brother for example majored in Comp Sci but did a minor in Music Technology. Semi related, but he's working cyber security for a bank now not a music tech thing lol. He just always enjoyed audio engineering and stuff so he decided to add a minor for that for fun. If you're gonna pay a shit ton of money for a school then you might as well add something you enjoy.",best major to study in college
