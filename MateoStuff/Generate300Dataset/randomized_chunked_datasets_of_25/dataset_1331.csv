25632,best cricket teams of all time,"Australian 2003 World Cup Team. Ponting, McGrath, Gilchrist, Bevan, Lee, Martyn, Hayden, Symonds and Gillespie.

Warne was around the team at the same time, but was banned just prior to the tournament. 

You can see the clear space between Aus and SA (and anyone else) on the graph."
12552,best gifts for mom,"To amend to this, I would like it all to be done in my absence to my standards. Not **good enough** standards.

Honestly, I would like a day of thank yous and just appreciation for all the little things I do that I feel no one notices."

5978,best programming language for web development,"Sorry, i didnt mean 'hate', I dislike it because the way my teacher taught us, He was trying to teach us machine learning from day 1 for some reason i dont know. It was complicated then, ill take a go at it again i guess. Thank you for feedback"
64688,Best Nike running shoes,"Aw shiet. Went to 3 shoe stores in Seattle area and none had them. Guess I""ll have to try Nike Town in Seattle to try some on."
3914,best online college,A good portion of my job is HR related. Everything matters when presenting yourself to a company. Seeing that online degree on your resume is not a positive...
36697,best alcoholic drink,Toronto! The LCBO (Liquor-store) has it in stock almost always!
72983,best Linux distro,i would love to see void linux on that list one day
17070,best iOS game,Kartrider+ is the same as [KartRider Rush+](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/kartrider-rush/id1466736988)?
70366,best major to study in college,Happy with my studies rn but i wish i was more smarter and know what I’m doing when i graduated HS bc i wasted my time studying CS i didnt learn or was my interest. I was only doing it for money. Then i moved and changed my major
29990,best money managing app,"Mint has a ton of budgeting. Check the ""This month"" tab, then the top block is the budget. My wife and I have used it for the last decade.

I will say that the ads in Mint are pretty intrusive. After using a few alternative apps for a few months, Nerdwallet is just ok for a free one. Simplifi is a great ad-free alternative to Mint - but it requires a subscription. 

The Wirecutter review is pretty spot-on:

Edit: Thanks autocorrect"
9450,best toothpaste,"Ho-ho-hold up - you're on a dentist's wages, and you're worrying about *buying* a tube of *toothpaste?*"
43177,best detective show,Yes. This.
30042,best money managing app,"when I graduated 7 years ago, plano ko din sana yan, basing on my more than four years experience of manually listing down my expenses , and formally studying on an accountancy course for a semester. Though it didn't go that route ..."
6666,best iPhone,"I have considered that. But isn't the processor too old at this point to handle the majority of apps now?

For example. I cannot run both maps navigation and spotify at the same time on my current SE without it skipping and freezing and tweaking out. I thought that was a processor problem."
48145,best color to paint with,That's just like your opinion man.
8143,best toothpaste,"My dentist recommended an Emmi-Dent.  He didn't sell them either, he told me I could get the best price from Amazon of all places.  I REALLY like it.  If I brush slowly like the directions say to, it really feels like I just left the dentist.  It takes longer to brush, about 5 minutes vs 2, but I am happy I made the switch, it's also about as expensive as a nicer sonicare."

40521,best midrange GPU,"True, that's actually what I am going to get soon. The value is just too hard to pass on."
40152,best midrange CPU,"Ryzen 2600 is the best CPU for a mid range budget.  It's not going to limit any GPU, so you don't need to worry about that, it will play everything you throw at it just fine."
47612,best state to visit in the United States,"I agree. As much as I prefer the mountains, there are more states with mountain ranges than cities of this scale. I'd also recommend different waterfalls over Niagara."
71189,best movies with a cool twist,"The Guest, don't watch the trailer or read anything about it other than it's about a veteran who comes home and bonds with the family of his dead friend."
1621,best ice cream flavor,"A local place does gorgonzola and pear. And earlier this year I tried blood orange, which was amazing. At the same place I also tried ""fig yoghurt,"" which the person behind the counter insisted was definitely ice cream, not frozen yoghurt! Either way it was the best thing I ever tasted.   
 Edit: My favourite flavour of all time is rose. Not sure how strange that really is but I had to throw it in there. Earl Grey ice cream is amazing too. I'll stop now."
