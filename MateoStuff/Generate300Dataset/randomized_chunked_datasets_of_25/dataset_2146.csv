22514,"I met Chelsea Handler when I lived in telluride, and to be honest, I'm not even sure I can call it meeting her, because she was so rude about the incident. I was taking the gondola home after having a few drinks with my friends, headphones in, minding my own business. The gondola stops half way at a restaurant and she and a friend were waiting to get on. She spots me, and very loudly announces to her friend that she isn't going to ride with someone they didn't know. Her friend rolls his eyes and tells her that I probably don't care who she is and to just get on the gondola. Keep in mind, I hadn't even taken a second glance, I didn't care. She reluctantly gets on, but the entire time she kept glaring at me and huffing under her breath. She gave off huge ""I'm more important than you"" vibes.
