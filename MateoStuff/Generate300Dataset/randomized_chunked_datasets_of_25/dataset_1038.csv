48750,"Spotted this while I'm checkin monitor shit again, since one of my 2 remaining 24in monitors died and am lookin to replace it with a *decent* 27in, that isn't quite as expensive as my LG 27GL850 I picked up months ago.

I *was* a bit skeptical/worried 'bout the 'screen bleed' myself when lookin into monitors, but at least compared to my old monitors, it's quite nice.

Apparently it's HDR is rather 'meh', but wasn't all that interested in HDR, and the brightness/colour quality is wonderful.

Can't really compare properly to other monitors I've not used myself, but it's rather highly-rated for a reason, and as you can see in the automod post, still a rather good 1440p, 144hz monitor.

&nbsp;

To note, I've played a rather wide variety of games on the LG 27GL850 since I got it, including:

Fallout 4

Titanfall 2

Rimworld

Prison Architect

Factorio

War Thunder

Battletech

Space Engineers

64055,"aye, it seems every sunday they go free these days.  Something funny though...I don't know if they are doing it just to me, but I tried downloading books yesterday and it was ultra slow and the downloads failed.

I think on free days...well they either know my ip and are slowing my downloads down on free days, or they are starting to slow down downloads on free days.  Were you downloads super slow?

If you didn't know how to download, you have to inspect element or download a video download plugin.  What I do is I right click the mouse, scroll to inspect element, click it, then press play on the book.  Then the media file will pop up at the bottom if you click media and other, then you right click that and open it in another page.

But ya, assuming you already knew that were your download speeds super slow?",best place to pirate audiobooks reddit

49000,"27GL850 is, from what I've seen, generally considered one of the best all around 1440p gaming monitors because it has great response time but the other benefits that come with an IPS panel. I bought one and have been very happy with it so far.
