6613,"Amy - documentary about the rise and fall of the talented Amy Winehouse.  

The History of the Eagles - The amazing story of one of the biggest rock bands ever told by the Eagles themselves

Hired Gun - It’s about side musicians.  You know, those guys that you see playing with your favourite band or on their records but they aren’t really part of the band and you don’t even know their name.  

The Wrecking Crew - it’s about a group of session musicians from the 60’s who played on hundreds if not thousands of records.  Many of them top 40 hits and you wouldn’t even know they were on the record because they never got credit.  They’d put the official band members on the album sleeve but the wrecking crew more often than not were the ones playing on the record",best Netflix documentary

It discusses swarm theory mathematically, particularly how a few knowledgeable individuals in the swarm can direct the entire swarm. The exact example is in terms of a school of fish in which a few fish know where food is.",best research paper archive

34610,"Sure but I think it's a little unfair to other positions I would say was Jerry rice better at playing wr than tom Brady is at qb. I think yes, based on direct comparisons between Jerry and his competition and Brady and his competition. Rice is just so far ahead statistically from other wideouts it's insane. 



Now realize before we go downtown his road were splitting hairs over the best players in history and Brady is very deserving of the number 1 spot but I hate how people downplay other positions greatness because qbs are more integral to the team.",best NFL player

65855,"As a Californian who just went through the college selection process I do not argue on the academics portion. But I do disagree on two things

First they are just expensive as private schools. They are terrible at financial aid. Going through the process I decided to go out of state to a different school because they would give me financial aid and it is considerably cheaper.

Secondly the major UCs like cal, ucla, ucsd, ucsb are no longer helping the students of California. What I mean by that is that they are consistently taking out of staters with the same grades or worse rather than instaters solely because of money. I would want to see the UCs be more like North Carolina chapel hill. Where it sets a higher bar for out of state students to get in.",best college in california

Can you please explain kids cough medicine? Is it the same thing in smaller dosages or is it a different medicine all together?
