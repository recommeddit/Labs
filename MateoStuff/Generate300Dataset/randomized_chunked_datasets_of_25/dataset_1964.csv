28937,best breakfast foods,"Blocks of cheese. Papperjack, cheddar, or Swiss or Colby"
29672,best game console,"I've decided to add Persona 4 to the list, thanks for your feedback :)

Not sure if I can bring myself to include a flight game from a console though, even if it is good. But I'll think about it and look into the game."
6613,best Netflix documentary,"Amy - documentary about the rise and fall of the talented Amy Winehouse.  

The History of the Eagles - The amazing story of one of the biggest rock bands ever told by the Eagles themselves

Hired Gun - It’s about side musicians.  You know, those guys that you see playing with your favourite band or on their records but they aren’t really part of the band and you don’t even know their name.  

The Wrecking Crew - it’s about a group of session musicians from the 60’s who played on hundreds if not thousands of records.  Many of them top 40 hits and you wouldn’t even know they were on the record because they never got credit.  They’d put the official band members on the album sleeve but the wrecking crew more often than not were the ones playing on the record"
14481,best romantic novel,"I have read book 2, and also The Bird and the Sword. I read Where The Lost Wander a few days ago too. I like HF but haven't read much in that setting and I thought it was really good."
43235,best detective show,I hope you “enjoy??” It as much as I did
13864,best research paper archive,"I found [this paper](http://www.princeton.edu/~icouzin/Couzinetal2005.pdf) to be really interesting because it lays down mathematics to situations with which we have an intuitive understanding of. It discusses swarm theory mathematically, particularly how a few knowledgeable individuals in the swarm can direct the entire swarm. The exact example is in terms of a school of fish in which a few fish know where food is."
30047,best money managing app,"taking photo of receipt looks like a nice feature, mukang kailangan ko idagdag to sakin. anyway, saan nagstore yung auto backup feature nila?"
26630,best board games,"An oldie and seemingly hidden gem, but definitely beloved in my family."
7039,best iPhone,I personally think that the current lineup with their pricing is really well balanced. Last year felt like more of a clusterfuck to me. The XR fits in better now than it did last year IMO.
34610,best NFL player,"Sure but I think it's a little unfair to other positions I would say was Jerry rice better at playing wr than tom Brady is at qb. I think yes, based on direct comparisons between Jerry and his competition and Brady and his competition. Rice is just so far ahead statistically from other wideouts it's insane. 



Now realize before we go downtown his road were splitting hairs over the best players in history and Brady is very deserving of the number 1 spot but I hate how people downplay other positions greatness because qbs are more integral to the team."
45675,best trick or treating candy,"I don't enjoy it, it tastes awful, but for some reason, once I start eating it I just can't stop."
65855,best college in california,"As a Californian who just went through the college selection process I do not argue on the academics portion. But I do disagree on two things

First they are just expensive as private schools. They are terrible at financial aid. Going through the process I decided to go out of state to a different school because they would give me financial aid and it is considerably cheaper.

Secondly the major UCs like cal, ucla, ucsd, ucsb are no longer helping the students of California. What I mean by that is that they are consistently taking out of staters with the same grades or worse rather than instaters solely because of money. I would want to see the UCs be more like North Carolina chapel hill. Where it sets a higher bar for out of state students to get in."
11840,best gifts for dad,Jesus. I thought you meant from the kids...
10792,best suitcase lock,I found this to be the most reasonable comment here.
57925,best cologne,Polo Green.
25282,best spiderman actor,"Come on, people, it’s Spider-Man! Respect the hyphen. 

I picked Holland, but I think Garfield is an underrated Peter Parker. Maybe a little emo, but he really nailed the smart alec/quippy vibe that makes Spidey, great. 

I’ll also side with whoever said Jake Johnson because that rendition of Pete is flawless."
37619,best Marvel movie,"> However, I the MCU fans grade it harsher because it doesn't do what MCU films typically are A+ at (action/CGI)

I mean it does them, just not as well as some. And that's mostly the big action piece at the end. I liked the club/car stuff and the waterfall fights."

53594,best medicine for a cold,"Hi OP! Thanks for this!

Can you please explain kids cough medicine? Is it the same thing in smaller dosages or is it a different medicine all together? I know some cough medicine brands are for children 6 and over and others don’t make that distinction. Does Zarbees actually do anything or does it just coat the the throat with honey?

Sincerely,

mom with a coughing 4 year old"
40960,best instrument to play,"I totally do not undervalue percussionists, I was simply stating that if you want one single instrument to learn that would be easier, one percussion instrument would be alot easier then many others. Learning a variety of percussion is different then one singular instrument. 

Theres also a huge difference between learning an instrument to play and playing at a professional level"

56930,best water brand,"Yeah, Fiji is one of my favorites."
68935,best science fiction novel,"I just finished it, and I'll say that while I didn't think it was awful - I did finish it, after all - it did not live up to its hype. I don't consider it a waste of my time, but the author could have taken his idea to some way more interesting places."
