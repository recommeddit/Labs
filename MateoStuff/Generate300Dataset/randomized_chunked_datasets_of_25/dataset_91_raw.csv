Wow. Lots of Almond Joy hate in this thread. Am I the only one who thinks they're ok? Thanks for the tips. :p
Yeah Iâ€™m in the anti-sileo club even if it means no jailbreaks. All for Zebra if it turns out like Cydia!

"This mostly applies to countries where higher education isn't state sponsored, so, mainly to the US, UK, and many Asian and commonwealth countries.
