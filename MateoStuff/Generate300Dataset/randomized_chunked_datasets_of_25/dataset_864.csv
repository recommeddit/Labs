20067,best workout music,Random question but does anybody know who wrote/compiled this list?
50500,best rap album,"i dont think it has any bad tracks either. but tracks like perfect hair. A.T.H.F and no names are kinda boring to me, i just feel like DOOM's voice is extra laid back on some of the songs on the album while he is talking about very uninteresting things.  maybe im not a big enouch cartoon nerd."
8234,best toothpaste,"Straight white Colgate. Best shit ever. Got every blemish, rubber mark and grease mark off my old ass car. Shit works better than an SOS pad with no scratching."

18564,best YouTube video,"Just add wourdor, badabing bada boom. Allicin."
66208,best soccer team in the world,"I'm just trying to point out that he has completely misunderstood the point of the poll, and is trying to list the ""correct"" ranking based on a wrong interpretation of the entire post."
29166,best web hosting service,"It all depends on what a person needs and where they are at currently in terms of the age of their website. For example, if someone is just starting out, I would recommend that they use a basic managed WordPress hosting package from the likes of NameCheap. It’s affordable and it’s got all you need to handle a modest amount of traffic. 

Also, if someone doesn’t know squat about development and design, Elementor is a VERY handy WP page builder. There’s a free version for newbies, as well as a premium version. If you’re serious about your website, I definitely recommend going with Elementor premium. Yeah, it will set you back around $60 a year, but what’s $60 per year if you’re ruining a serious, legit business, bro?"

>The Leaf and most other CHAdeMO vehicles are capable of bi-directional charging “out of the box.” It’s just not a capability that Nissan has ever taken advantage of for home customers in the U.S. 

Ok, they almost did it."

47802,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Calculators arent allowed in college calculus and beyond. Graphing calculators are a waste of money and a assle with batteries and the learning curve. Download a free graphing app on your phone, since it won't have much of a learning curve. Get yourself a cheap tablet, instead, in case you decide to pirate textbooks or want an on the go pdf reader

Or an external terabyte harddrive"
