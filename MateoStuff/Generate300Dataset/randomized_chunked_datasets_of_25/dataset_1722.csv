53919,best medicine for a cold,"IIRC there was a nasal spray in the 2000s that contained zinc for exactly that purpose. 

It was pulled off the market and lead to a class action lawsuit by all those who permanently lost their sense of smell because of it. 

TL;DR - joking or not, don't put zinc up your nose."

44578,best items under $100,Don’t suppose you can enchant my shower? Dull old pipes can barely melt butter.
11621,best gifts for dad,"A water carbonation machine. He'd waste loads of money buying carbonated water at the grocer's, so he's been very happy being able to carbonate tap water himself. I bought it for him over a decade ago, and it's so well-used it's down to bare plastic, but it's still going strong."

39311,best web browser,The boomark toolbar only showing in new tab page and not on websites. So when I open New tab I see my bookmark bar till I go to a website it goes away.

It shouldn't get sloppy, because moderation rules are very clear: stuff that is not scientific papers will be deleted.

Also, it's not limited to ""hard science"". Any scientific field is welcome."
