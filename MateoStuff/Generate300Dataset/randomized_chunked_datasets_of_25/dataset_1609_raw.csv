"Iâ€™d say that the XR fits your needs pretty much in that order. The battery is incredible! The screen is nice, and the camera is great! Itâ€™s hard to buy a phone with a bad camera these days though."
"I've had an Ogio bookbag since 2004, still running strong, and I'm for sure a student for life. :)"
"I know this isn't hip hop (which is also my main go to) but this song.. when the beat drops and the dude says NO MERCY, I just want to beast everything in sight.

Buy what?
"Politically, Norway, the Netherlands or Denmark, except the climate sucks. 

Bermuda, maybe?"
"AND IM SORRY THAT, SORRY THAT, SORRY THAT I CANT FORGETTTT, shoutout julian and the strokes"
"So guys, I recently moved in. The tree in the corner is a sycamore and the roots are doing damage to the walls. The sap it drops is gross also. 

I live in the UK in London and ideally I'd like a an evergreen tree to screen the garden off from the neighbours. It's south facing and ideally I would like it to have a smallish non destructive root due to the proximity of the walls. 

Your help will be appreciated ðŸ˜Š"
"I think this really addresses OP's problem. Compounds are tricky because the common usage changes over time, and even dictionaries will disagree. First step for me is to check the client's style guide / preference. Next step is to go to a dictionary \(pick one because usage can vary between dictionaries\). If it's an oddball term that the dictionary doesn't clarify, I go by what appears to be the most common usage \(wikipedia, google searches, well\-known competitors, etc.\)"
Only certain varieties have SLS. And canker sores are cake next to sensitive teeth.
SOFI. BLK. IAC. I only own those three. SOFI is my smallest position and BLK is my largest. Will likely hold these stocks for 5yrs or more. I also own VOO. This etf I will hold for decades.
so you're implying that some albums are objectively better? that's not how opinions work buddy.
"Perfect list. 

Missing *36 Chambers* though."
"I like and use peppermint...It is easy to transition to from windows, is based on ubuntu, and there is a good forum for it.   I noticed nobody else mentioned it.  I am sure any of the suggestions would work."

"Probably the Rusty Lake games (horror/puzzle, most free, a few premium). I know theyâ€™re older than that but I only recently discovered them!

Honorable mentions: Alter Ego (idle tapper/psychological test, free, pay to remove ads), There is No Game (retro arcade/puzzle, with a story, paid), Elder Scrolls: Blades (RPG, free, can buy some unnecessary bonuses), and Simonâ€™s Cat (casual, in Arcade)."
Wouldnâ€™t the 11 pro be the same too? I mean the only different thing about the look of it is the camera but that doesnâ€™t change the feel of the phone.
"Visible does support wifi calling on iPhones and some Androids. Unfortunately, not Pixels at the moment."
"The Forever War is one of my favourites, too. There's been talk of a film being made of it - I'm not sure how that would play out, but the potential is huge."
I loved Miss Sherlock. Watched it via HBO here in the states.
"It was actually a tiny Air B&B in Yachats OR, I highly recommend. There is nothing like being right on the ocean and living for a few days with access to a firepit, a little grocery store, and a million quiet, touristy shops. Plus, the best coffee shop I've ever been to right down the street. I desperately want to go back someday!"
"Golden Brown I think will pair nicely the Sierra Blue phone. I already got my case in a few days ago.

Archerâ€™s Voice ðŸ¥° I love that book!
Pacifica Sugared Amber Dreams is really great and I think it was about $20.00
Huh. Well there you go. I thought the requirement was being a resident. Apparently not.
"Favorite foods that they may not buy for themselves.  
Pictures (or, if you want to get fancy, an internet connected picture frame that you can update for them.)    
Experiences with you or with each other.  Take them somewhere nice or send them on a trip."
