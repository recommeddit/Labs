4154,best text editor,Thinks html is a programming language. Number 1 choice is sublime. Mentions brackets and TextMate which are kinda dead communities if not actually dead projects and an editor for ios but not Emacs.
1031,best ice cream flavor,"Great by itself, but even better as part of spumoni as long as you can find a good cherry ice cream and a nice dark chocolate ice cream that’s not too sweet."
37297,best amusement park,"The NYC metro area is huge. Population isn't the problem with that park, it's the value proposition, the requirement that you need a ticket to enter the park, and paid parking. I'll give you that NYC isn't lacking in things to do (or places to shop, since it's in a mall after all), but I don't think the place is tailored to tourists as much.

Even for competition, a lot of your audience can find a better value for money with Six Flags (more rides for an older audience). Coney Island and the shore piers are popular, and don't require a ticket to walk around with your kids. Hersheypark pulls a lot from the suburbs looking for weekend getaways. Legoland NY is opening next year and aimed right in the same demographic space, too."
56243,best action and adventure movie,"I second BTTF. It's not about a location, it's about getting back...to the future! Time travel adventure can't be replicated without comparing the OG. Amazing."
40240,best midrange CPU,"Steve keeps mentioning the ""misconception that Ryzen CPUs are smoother"" in gaming but wasn't that mostly because the x600 Ryzen CPUs had 12 threads while the i5 had 4 and then later 6? Of course the 10600K will be as ""smooth"" as x600 Ryzen CPUs when it also has 12 threads.


I don't recall ever seeing people claim that Ryzen was ""smoother"" in gaming when it didn't have a core or thread count advantage. I certainly would not expect my 2700X to be ""smoother"" in gaming than a 9900K."
11939,best gifts for dad,Old Spice gift set with aftershave and cologne.
34340,best NFL player,I just read the list a few times.  I thought OP messed up because Lamar was not in top 10.  Is this list from 2017?
15124,best tree for the garden,Go to the Ohio Agricultural Extension Service website and do some research. Often fast growing trees are weak wooded or prone to disease and you can easily end up with a giant headache on your hands. Also know that crowding shrubs is a really good way to encourage disease and mean you are constantly pruning.  Have a little patience.
53193,best hiphop album,"I think interscpope? But he's clearly in their circle. ROTD4, if it happens, will def include him"
4519,best text editor,Adobe's free and open source [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) looks pretty neat.
43723,best items under $100,"When we were in Japan, nearly every bathroom seemed to use Toto products. Half of our bathroom trips ended with somebody singing Africa."
39895,best Chrome extensions,"Thats actually amazing for sending out resumes. I can check if the fuckers actually cliked on my portfolio site before declining me.



Does it leave any trace that you are using it?"
5369,best home improvement store,[Lily Ann Cabinets](https://www.lilyanncabinets.com/) Just used them when we remodeled our kitchen. Great prices and outstanding build quality and customer service.
68893,best science fiction novel,"[Those threads aren't dead](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/kodwij/month_of_december_wrapup_and_optional_2020/) although it does feel like they slide down the front page more rapidly than a lot of others that (obviously IMHO) are less interesting.  Perhaps because they get relatively low numbers of comments or upvotes, and the default Reddit display algorithm pushes them down as a consequence?"
32629,best vacation resort,"Ok, two days into the adventure I would recommend Hyatt Zilara without reservations.

I will say that they upsell you (and dang it, it worked) but the suites are nice, the pools is awesome - and the surrounding beaches are just beautiful and great for playing in.

The food is all inclusive and has so far been pretty good. The sushi place was so/so but their teppanyaki was good and a fun little show. I recommend that when you book the hotel you make them get you reservations for that, Marie Maria, and Chefs plate (mostly because they are ""hard"" to get reservations at according to reviews and from what we've seen that is right).

Free drinks all around, pool service, free room service, etc is good.

Hope that helps, and congratulations on your upcoming wedding."

54580,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Mid makes the pads faster for sure. My otsu v2 in mid felt faster than my hien in soft. So your comment doesn't surprise me.

Closest to qck is the zero. Raiden is way faster. Raiden is faster than your hien, though only a little bit. Raiden feels very soft to the touch and is quite unique, not like gsr se."
13644,best research paper archive,Why not just make a free-to-view peer-run online publishing co?  I'm sure a kickstart will be more than ample to get a server running.
37413,best amusement park,"It may not be the best, but i think Knotts Berry Farm provides a very fun and thrilling Halloween experience"
10454,best suitcase lock,"Dinner's been canceled, due to lack of hustle."
39315,best web browser,"[Not really.](https://youtu.be/Co6FePZoNgE)

Improving is an understatement, the level of compatibility I get now makes it basically an established platform. The majority of my Windows-only games run on Linux without setup now, and some of the ones which may need setup have very basic how-to guides on forums and wikis."
65790,best college in california,SLO. Not really sure how Pomona stacks up to the other CSUs
13335,best spreadsheet editor,"No, sorry, that was confusing. I meant in Excel."
17068,best iOS game,"I don’t purchase games too often, but some free ones that really grabbed me this year:

-	Random Dice
-	Legends of Runeterra
-	Coffee Inc. 
-	Golf Blitz
-	Among Us

In order of addiction. Random Dice is probably my biggest surprise. I was so sure it would be straight garbage, ad-riddled nonsense, but it’s surprisingly fully opt-in if you want to watch ads for unlocks, it’s pretty decently balanced, you can unlock tons of dice without spending a cent, and while 5 co-op plays is sort of lame (and paywalling more of them is worse) you can do quite a lot of runs without any interference. 

The in game currency is absolutely outrageously priced though, Jesus."
5698,best programming language for web development,"I have programmed before. I graduated college in December of 2014 in Information Systems where I did two semesters of Java, 1 semester of SQL, 1 semester of COBOL, and one semester of JCL; so I know the basics. As you know, once you stop coding for a year or more you get rusty. Plus Java was object oriented whereas, as I understand web development languages are pretty different. 

I think I'd be alright going the HTML - CSS - JS - MySQL - Wordpress route. I have a really good HTML/CSS book which I follow pretty easily and will be following that up with the corresponding javascript book.
