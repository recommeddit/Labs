4059,best online college,"Very cool! I’m really excited to dive deeper into this. I have a background in film, photography and marketing so I think they are pretty transferable. 

Where are you located and what type of company do you work for? I’m wondering if this is a job I can find in any part of the country (or world) and what type of companies are hiring"

7507,best laptop for general use,"There's a chance that there will be better deals, so if you can wait, it might be worth it. Deals will be posted on this subreddit."

33913,best Pokemon game,"I have a lot of Nostalgia since that was the first time I could afford a new game (had played tf out of Gold and Emerald while my friends had Gen IV), but I def agree Black & White was one of the best. I think simplifying it by starting over with 150 Pokemon was a genius idea. They were able to look at everything they've done and put the best parts of the previous generations into it without making it overcomplicated. The story was really unique too and so much better than previous ones. It's insane all the stuff they packed in a 6 year old platform, too. I loooved going on my computer to put the Pokemon in the dream world and even had freaking video chat!! Plus the entire design language for the game was so good with it's hexagons and perfect balance of monochrome with color touches."
9616,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I really didn't want to be in FT either, but ended up getting put there and was super bummed...but it turned out to be really great. It gets a bad rep for being so far, but in turn it creates a community that is awesome. All the floors are coed (except for a few), you have a pool, your own dining commons, etc., and things can get pretty crazy there. Yeah it's far, but it's only for a year, and you'll have IV the next 3 years. I hung out with friends in all the other dorms, and the social life paled to FT. So yeah, I would definitely say FT for sure.

If you're really set against it, Anacapa and Santa Cruz were decent.

Edit: I can't grammar"

60430,Best comedy show on Netflix,"How in the hell has no one said **What We Do In The Shadows**?!? It's truly the best comedy on television right now, especially since Schitt's Creek is off the air. They did two seasons and are working on a third now. If you liked Parks and Rec, you'll love this. Basically every line is quotable. It sounds like a strange concept, but give it a chance. Available on Hulu."

47372,best state to visit in the United States,"I know you said no LA, but it is a major city with direct flights from England. It's one of the most culturally diverse cities outside of NY, has pretty consistently great weather, has incredible food from all cuisines, has a ton of museums, great music scene, and you can do everything from surfing to snowboarding to hiking the desert to hiking the mountains all in the same day. Plus it's a short drive to places like Six Flags of Disneyland. There are now 2 NFL teams there, as well as 2 NBA teams, 1 NHL & MLB teams(2 each if you include Anaheim). And then 2 hours south(if you're lucky, or about 3 hour train ride) is San Diego, which is another great city. It's somewhat similar to LA, but more laid back, less traffic, better Mexican food, and one of the best destinations in the country for beer. And San Diego has a ton to do as well, from swimming with sharks to Balboa Park and the zoo to seeing the sea lions, etc. And 20 minutes south of San Diego is Tijuana and Baja California. Tijuana has incredible food, both Mexican and otherwise, diverse museums, professional soccer team that is usually good, pretty solid craft beer scene. And Ensenada has beautiful beaches, and inland from there is Valle de Guadalupe, which is wine country and beautiful. Plus great food and great boutique hotels/B&Bs."

59649,best perfume,Likely in your early 20s and still discovering your preferences beyond what you see in popular culture. Obviously a sweets fan. I'm guessing you enjoy wearing mainly athleisure-wear

42860,best detective show,"Yeah I have the same issue with true crime docs, but I research everything after so I have a better idea of the true story.  That's why I like sports docs the most because even if they are seeped in bias, at the end of the day its just sports."
62132,Best RPG game on PS4,You should try Days Gone. Takes a couple hours to get going but the story is one of the best I’ve ever experienced in video games
11179,best backpack for college,"Dakine! I've had 3 bags from a single purchase about 10 years ago.  They have a fantastic lifetime warranty and the only problems i've ever had is with the zippers.  I have Dakine luggage, camera bags, a pack for school, and a backcounty ski pack, all of which i use regularly.  

Oh, and they're stylish to boot."
