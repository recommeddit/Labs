Doesn't matter if they're digital or physical, a well-chosen book is almost always a good purchase, and definitely increases your quality of life. You could learn something new, find solace from your troubles, go on an adventure, or just occupy your time in a cost-effective way.

Don't want to buy one right now? Nevermind, go to your nearest public library (I hope you have one, lots of them are being closed down now) and wander around a bit until you find a book that calls out to you.

24095,"I'm doing this based on how much i feel like anime have effected the community not necessarily how good they are (im putting this here just for one in particular and seasoned anime fans already know what it is.)

In order of what i have seen to what i haven't but not ranked in any particular order:

Clannad + Afterstory: If someone asks me what show has effected me the most, i would say it's this one. This show is powerful and known throughout the community for a good reason. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and If you like romance, it's an absolute must see. If someone in the anime community says ""feels"" I guarantee this show comes into mind. It's not perfect but I definitely think it is one of the best of it's kind. Although not ""original"" because there are a ton of shows that have been done with high school and drama and whatever... This show does go one step further and that one step is one huge ride. This show is over 10 years old and it looked beautiful and it still does to this day. It is a classic.

Steins;Gate: Damn this show was so amazing. I don't think there is quite another like it. It uses real life events and with it being so recent it looks amazing. The characters are all memorable, lovable, and the story is near unforgettable because of how original it is. Maybe time travel isn't exactly ""original"" but what they do with it is completely unique. It is where it is on MAL for a reason.

Higurashi no naku koro ni + Kai: Unfortunately for this show, most people don't know that there even is a second season because it was never released outside Japan. This is a statement i'm sure will get refuted but I would say that this show is the pinnacle of the horror genre in anime. I would also say that it is one of the best adaptations of a VN there is because of how much it stays like a VN. This show will confuse those who just watch it at first but once everything falls into place it really puts in that ""Holy s**t."" factor when the second season starts rolling around and explaining things. The show operates in a time loop, where shit goes down, then it goes back to where everything is fine and then something else happens. It's referenced so much in the community that the phrase ""Higurashi face"" - the extreme exaggeration of an expression and personality, has become a thing. The characters are all memorable and all the twists this show throws at you can really mess with your head. Although the animation is sub par at best, it is still very much worth a watch, just not in the dark alone... that is crazy.

School Days: Now just bear with me ok. ""Why would you ever say this is a *must see anime* are you insane?"" While I see what you're saying let me elaborate. This show is one of the most if not THE most infamous show in the anime community. Now if you are going to understand the countless references to it, I say give it a watch with an open mind. Personally I went into it knowing all the hate on it, and i enjoyed the fuck out of it. All the stupidity everyone said, was COMPLETELY RIGHT, so much so that it was funny to me. I laughed so hard it almost killed me. But some people are into shows like this and think it is genius. While i give that it is somewhat original in it's plot, i would argue it goes about it all wrong and could have been better. And that ending though? It's iconic. You can't even really dispute that. It's just a thing. So if you are an anime fan you know what this is and you should see for yourself why everyone talks about it.

Now for shows I haven't seen but I know I have to soon:

Cowboy Bebop: Now I haven't seen this show so i can't talk THAT much about it, but just from sheer impact this show has had on the anime community I know about it enough to give a summary. This show takes place in the future and there are space bounty hunters running around in intense action scenes.  It's old but gold. I would say along with most, a classic.

Damn now this spot was hard to choose so i'm going to have an honorable mentions under this but last but not least:

Neon Genesis Evangalion: THE Mecha show. Now I haven't seen this show either but from what i've heard it's story is so amazing that it has a cult following. I know that code geass is like the new age mecha show that everyone goes crazy over but Evangalion just had to take this spot. 

I tried to include the most important in every genre that I could think of but let me throw some honorable mentions out there:

Death Note. Damn I was going to put this show but I already had 2 psychological thrillers up there and the ending was kinda like... meh. So i chose Evangalion over this even though I have seen Death Note and how good it was to start off.

Attack on Titan & Sword Art Online: I put these 2 together just because I think that they are riding off the hype of the times right now and they need to be out longer to be properly labeled as a ""must see"". Now you say 'Oh but Steins;Gate is up there and it's new'. Yea but that show is different. Attack on Titan is good but I don't this it's a classic as it is unfinished as of now and I don't know where the second season is going to take it. And SAO I haven't seen but even SAO fans say that the second half of the first season is like completely pointless so... yea.

Gurren Laggan: Now this show was good, but i think it was just good. I mean it's extremely popular but it feels very... For lack of a better explanation, it takes the ""Kid show"" approach to most problems. 
Main character gives inspirational speech>sudden burst of power nobody knew about>win. And it does have a lot of a good moments that I know about that are great, but that's just my opinion.

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Not much I can say, it's probably one of the best shows out there but I don't think it's enough to say it's a ""must see"" mostly because i'm really salty about the endless 8.

FMA:Brotherhood: Now This probably would be up there and replace something but I haven't seen it and im purposely avoiding spoilers to this show because im watching it soon. And it seems very easy to avoid spoilers because nobody really talks about it... It just is #1 on MAL and I barely hear about it. I hear about Angel Beats! more and that show I didn't think was that revolutionary.

Hope this helps!",best anime
