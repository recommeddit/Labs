"Pcmanfm-qt, it works for my minimal Wayland setup with hikari... it reminds me of the good old-days of LXDE. I prefer command line operation tbh."
"Interesting thing I noticed skimming the different sources:

There’s a very clear consensus on the bottom few movies - Thor TDW, Iron Man 2, Hulk. None of them appear over #17 on any list. 

But other than those three, every other movie is liked relatively well. Each of the other 20 movies rank in at least one source’s top 10. 8 movies rank #1, including the overall #12 Captain America TFA."
I really like Sunskis
Whenever I dang well please. Colder days it always seems to work.
Sword art online was great and deserves an honorable mention but the fact that (despite being my first sub anime) I forgot abt it :)
"Is it really a ""twist"" than it is a funny crossover?"

"I totally agree.  Definitely avoid dairy if you're already congested.  IT just makes the mucus thicker.

  And drink water until you think you might die from an overdose.  Your nose will be less stuffy, that annoying post nasal drip will disappear, and coughing will be easier.


Also sleep.  The time you can be complaining or half-heartedly doing work, you might as well sleep and then wake up a bit better each time."
"Account age, almost 4 years.  Damn, you're the definition of legit."
Right now sport check has Helly Hansen merino wool base layers on sale. Mark’s work warehouse has the socks on for half price as well.
"If your bag has a zipper to close it, no lock will secure it.

Recently rewatched all three of the McGwire Spiderman movies and the first two are actually really good and everything a Spider-Man movie should be. I think they get a bad rap for how good awful the third one was and how badly they fucked up Venom
I swear they do that purpose so you have to spend more time in the store.
"This is a great drink. As a funny/terrible variation we made one up called the American 75. It uses rye whiskey instead of gin, and the champagne of beers.."
"I've heard the same thing from people in government agencies. A *ton* of people think ""I want to be in the FBI, so I'll major in criminal studies!"" Sounds fairly straightforward. But the problem is that you're now competing with everyone in the country with the exact same thought process."
could be a migrant worker from india/Nepal.  Skateboarding is not an expensive hobby and iphone 7 is an old phone. don’t be so quick to judge.
I really like these ideas.  I agree it is important to figure out if she's be okay with a night away from the baby before booking it.  I know that I would not have considered a night away at such a young age because it would have been very difficult with breastfeeding/pumping and would have caused me a lot of anxiety.  I would have loved something I wouldn't have bought for myself!
"Depends on your comfortably with games like Pokemon.

Never even touched a turn based RPG or are planning to play with young kids? Let's Go 

Familiar enough with the concept? Sword and Shield 

Want something more old school with a modern twist? Wait for November and get Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl"
"Actually was coming here to post a similar question, but it wasn't exactly answered in here. 
Are there any decently healthy breakfast cereals? It seems like everything has the second ingredient as sugar, and even the brands that pretend to be healthy have almost as must sugar as fruit loops"
The YNAB app is fine for logging as you go!
"It's all about the user according to every study. many studies show poor cleaning by many with the electric because of bad technique or impatience. Thorough manual brushers who are thorough fare the best in tests.  
There are many. I am not choosing one from google to post, as I do not have the time to review the 50 or 70 tests to claim any respect for their methods. They all come out similarly."
"I love all of the suggestions here, but recently the most satisfying breakfasts for me have been... shredded wheat. (I'm an old lady now.) Super filling, healthy, and you can dress it up any number of ways depending on what you have on hand. Give it a try!"
"I love my egg sandwich just like that, except I prefer it on wheat toast.  And mine has yellow mustard on one side and mayo on the other.  (sounds weird, but is actually awesome)"
You might select old actors and movies too....
"It certainly has the graphics down. I'm not sure if it's the best, but I consider my rig (r9 290) fairly high end and I can't get into the higher settings."
