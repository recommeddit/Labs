37870,"You said ""look around"" and yeah, we're on the Marvel Studios Sub. & What ""Hill"" am I dying on? Geez, why are you so upset by this? You are completely ignoring my point on us in this sub tending to hype things in being top-tier if they're new. 

 No, I don't think you are in a minority if you think this isn't top 5 MCU lol. I think it's fucking great, but I would bet that a majority of people in the long run wouldn't put this over IW, Endgame, Ragnarok, TWS, Civil War, Iron Man, BP, Homecoming or FFH...",best Marvel movie

Haystack (not Haystack Mountain... very different) from the Garden trailhead.  Easily combinable with Marcy, but it'd be tough to car camp that one.

Edit: So the general consensus is just to focus more on certs, and not all that much on the college side of things?

73228,"I'd say that if you choose from a fairly large set of well supported distros this matters much less than it might first  seem. There is very little, if anything, you can do with Arch that you cannot do with Fedora or Ubuntu. Some things might be easier in Arch others in Ubuntu. My preference is for well known distros, I use Ubuntu, but I am not saying that is the only choice. Some of the things you mention are more about the default desktop environment choice than distro per se. In all decent distros changing the desktop environment is very easy. 

The big difference to me seems to be how bleeding edge you want your software to be. One thing that my fifteenish years with Linux has taught me is that obsessing over having the newest version of any app you use is a tiring rabbit hole.",best Linux distro
