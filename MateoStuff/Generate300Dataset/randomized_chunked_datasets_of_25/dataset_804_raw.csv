"Kitchenaid!! We work on Samsung fridges every single day and they are riddled with class action lawsuits, especially for their ice makers.

"1 bottle of nyquill night time formula.  1 bottle of Black Velvet (pick what you want, I use this) drink nyquil first, then mix liquor with hot tea.

Take 1 comforter and wrap yourself in the mummy wrap either in bed or on the couch.  Best if you are wearing long clothes but naked is ok too.

Watch television and drink liquored up tea until falling asleep, normally I watch the Godfather trilogy.  When I wake a day or some later, I am feeling better, and drink a gallon of water. 

The end."

"One of my favorite movies! 
The plot twist is more of a twist of perception which alters how the entire story has played out. Also, it makes you think! Wonderful movie!"
Can't argue with that.
I absolutely love Bemelman's Bar!
Wow I was just considering doing one of these. I live in Residence Hotel so I can cook my own meals when I don't feel like going out. I've lived in my current hotel 2 separate times now for a total of 10 months. I've been working on the road for around 6 years total with a break of a couple years in the middle.
