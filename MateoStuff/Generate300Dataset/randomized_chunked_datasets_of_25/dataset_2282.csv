4881,"As a homeowner, and also a contractor, Home Depot. I find myself constantly frustrated at Lowes because they always seem to be out of stock on very basic, very common items (mostly electrical and plumbing fittings), and their online inventory is hit or miss.

Ace/True Value can be good for oddball fasteners and hardware, but their prices are usually significantly higher on most items.

A supply house or lumber yard can be the best bet depending on what you're doing. Higher quality materials and generally knowledgeable employees at a slightly higher cost.",best home improvement store

55525,"Try Kingkiller Chronicle.  Its a trilogy, only two are out right now.  I recently finished them.  I have to say that they are two of the most well-written books I've ever read.  I wholeheartedly suggest them to anyone.  Patrick Rothfuss is an excellent author.

The books are:  The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear.

There is a subreddit, [/r/kingkillerchronicle](http://www.reddit.com/r/kingkillerchronicle), I don't suggest you go there til you read them, though.

60018,"I was just at tjmaxx and picked up Tru Fragrace Element Edition Pearl. I couldn't find it on fragrantica, it was $19.99 at TJX and $24 on Amazon for 3.4 oz. It's such a lovely second skin scent. Most second skin scents on me are too warm and ambery but this one is more neutral and fresh, it still has a coziness but is overall such a 'you but better' perfume. I found a blog that describes it as ""This particular scent ‘Pearl’ is inspired by its calming effects, which will leave you feeling relaxed in this chaotic world. Just like a unique gem, the notes Peach, Rosewater, and Skin Musk won’t go unnoticed.

Top Notes: Peach, Osmathus

Mid Notes: Orchid, Honeysuckle

Base Notes: Skin Musk, Tonka Bean""",best perfume
39370,">Yeah I would suggest using Firefox though. Brave still promotes the Chromium monoculture and their ad policy is parasitic, hurting small creators, in my opinion. Tbh it is a bit mafia like. Good reskin though

Disagree, quite the opposite actually. The ad design gives a larger revenue share back to small creators than Google AdSense.  That's why so many small YouTube creators have signed up for Brave (135,000 of them).",best web browser

1. Toothpaste that is ""whitening"" is actually worse for you than normal toothpaste because it contains abrasive material that is actually destroying stained enamel.
2. Studies are showing that mouthwash may not be as beneficial as once thought because it increases the pH in the mouth, therefore promoting bacterial growth.",best toothpaste
