"Been to a lot...even a few in Europe.  Surprisingly, I still put Dollywood at the top of my list.  It's one of the cleanest parks I've ever been in, even cleaner than any Disney park on a good day.  Good rides, good variety, good food, great scenery.  Definitely worth it."
"Hey man, it's a rough job but someone has to do it. Especially when they're between the end of their summer job and the start of school."
It needs a weather column and I am completely serious. Weather affects a lot of people's decision to live in a particular place or not.
You made me scroll right/left
A lot of the AT is mountainous.
Sunski is an online only brand that does homages to classic designs. I have had a pair which I use for travel (scuba trips and visits to generally rough parts of the world) and they've held up fairly well.
"Alright I guess I'm waiting for the ideapad 5 pro 14"""

"Sangakara isnt good enough with gloves plus his average is so much higher as batsman only. Richards didn't play enough test cricket to be judged (though it wasn't his fault). All your other selections are really close and it comes down to personal preference. Though I do prefer Lillee over Ambrose as Lillee was consistent and would form a devastating and balanced attack with Akram (massive swing), Marshall (pace,strike bowler) Lillee ( consistent with pace)"
A more keyboard/terminal oriented file manager would be… the terminal? I usually do everything in the terminal. It is hard to imagine a more convenient way.
This has not been my experience.  Spreadsheets editable on my tablet (haven't tried phone).

"Old Fashioneds during the winter, Gin and Tonics during the summer, Beer all the time."
I always wonder if companies who are hiring find online courses legitimate enough
Oh lmaooo I thought u were like a business/interdisciplinary  major or something from the way I read it
"A lifetime guarantee doesn't make something BIFL but it sweetens the pot! I too would agree with Timbuk2... I have 2 of their bags 1 Messenger bag (had it for 4 years and a stitch has not even thought about fraying). The other is a copilot roller bag for traveling... it has been through month in Europe, a week long US west coast trip and multiple weekend trips.. Long story short. THEY MAKE THE BEST BAGS IN THE WORLD!"
Amen to that.
"Accounting, Engineering, Computer Science/Programmer (extremely easy to find jobs).  

Medical field:  Nursing. 

Professional degrees are cool and all, in the long run.  Basically anything a combination of Science and Math."
It’s impossible not to.
"If you don't get a response from the senior author (usually the email that is provided), try emailing the first author who is usually a Postdoc or senior PhD student and are more likely to respond. You can usually find their email address by looking up the lab's website."
I love when they interview pro athletes that get drafted by one of our teams in B-Lo and they all talk about how they're excited to see NYC
"Probably Versace Eros, it was on sale for 20usd for 100ml (3.3 oz.) I Bought 5, should last me a long while."
"I was lucky enough to spend 6 hours sitting next to the man on an airplane. I was 7. Highlight of my life.

We ate lunch. I spilled on him. I thought I had ruined everything, but he just smiled and gave me his dessert."
Do you know anyone who has done this? So I know many people who did the Harvard extension masters programs but I did not see them get any job benefit from them.  Maybe they choose the wrong degree to get but from my experience these online degrees just do not count.  I hope I am wrong since I would like to do some online degrees.
No tree as I like all the natural light. I have a oak tree and all the acorns that I have to pick up is a pita!
