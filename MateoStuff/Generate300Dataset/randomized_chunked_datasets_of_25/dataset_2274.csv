2121,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Bettina might be “fancy” but it’s shit pizza. I’d gladly pay Rusty’s prices for it if it meant I’d get more than a goddamn teaspoon of sauce.

32370,best hotel to live in,"I once sat next to this nice, older guy on an airplane, we chatted about all sorts of mundane things for the whole 4 hour flight. After we got off the plane, my friend who had been sitting across the aisle asked me what we had talked about, since apparently the guy was a somewhat famous actor, although I still don't remember his name or what we talked about. A nice dude, and I got the feeling he probably preferred sitting next to me instead of my friend, who probably would have had all sorts of questions about his films. :)"

57714,best cologne,"I like YSL - la nuit de l’homme for winter/fall

Polo blue for an all year round scent

Armani - Aqua di gio EDP, and Davidoff coolwater in the summer

Your best bet is to go to a store, try a scent on your wrist and see how you like it over the following few hours.

Some good reviews in youtune might give you an idea of what to try"
5868,best programming language for web development,"I've got eight years of C# experience, , and I'd say that it's as valid a choice now as it was back then. The ecosystem is really strong, the tooling great, and if you're sold on a Linux environment you'd be surprised at how capable .NET Core can be. I'd go as far as to say that you can be productive on Windows and .NET standard as anyone can be on OSX/Linux with Python, PHP, or Ruby.

If you want to stick to a Linux environment, you can't really go wrong with Python and Ruby. I've started moving over to Ruby, having ignored it for years, and I'm really enjoying it so far. It's a very mature language with very few gotchas, which is great coming from another mature language in C#."

44241,best items under $100,"Wanna make that pasta even tastier? Cook your pasta in nearly seawater-salty water. When it's 2 minutes away from being done, throw it in a large skillet with about half to a cup of the pasta water (the starchy salty water helps the flavor and consistency A LOT) with the sauce. Heat on high and cook until the sauce has absorbed all the water (should do so pretty quickly). Then add a slice of butter to give the sauce restaurant-quality silkiness and a good handful of a subtle harder cheese (like grana padano or pecorino, or a combo of both) to act as a binder. 

It will be the best spaghetti you have ever had, and it adds less than 5 minutes to the cook time."

3888,best online college,"My dad's 3rd Masters is from IU's online program. Degree doesn't make any mention of that fact. Of course, it's not like it's been put to the Job Application test since he's been in the same field for 40+ years."
42012,movies like Inception,"You really cannot go wrong with any of Chris Nolans films. They arent all as deep as inception, but the worst he's ever done is Dark Knight Rises and that's a pretty entertaining movie, so literally anything from his filmography is a good starting point. Also check out Denis Villeneuve (he directed arrival), his films like Prisoners, Sicario, and especially Enemy will probably fit the bill of what you're looking for."
