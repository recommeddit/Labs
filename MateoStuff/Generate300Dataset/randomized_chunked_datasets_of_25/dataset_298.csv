5070,best home improvement store,"I like HD better in general, they have a deeper selection of products, tools, lumber and trim.  I like Behr paint a lot more than Valspar, and I like Ridgid tools a lot more than kobalt.

I go to Lowe's 95% of the time though, because I can take my dog on a leash and get her some exercise and social time, so unless I need paint or tools, Lowe's it is.

I've been trying to go to Ace/local lumber yard lately, but the lumber yard people are so rude, it feels like they do not want you there.  I love Ace stores, except they're so small I always have to go somewhere else to get everything I need."

16815,best pet for toddlers,I think you should probably try an easier pet first. All of the things you mentioned minus size are hugely affected by training.
4257,best text editor,Honestly I've been really content with VSCode + Vim Mode plugin. It gives me the raw text manipulation power of  Vim with the high level semantic understanding of VSCode.
54997,best water filter,"It depends on what you're starting with.  If you're talking about tap water from a municipal water supply in a modern (1st world, industrialized) country then it's already safe, and all the Brita filter does is make it taste better by removing safe but bad-flavor-causing stuff.

If on the other hand you're dealing with untreated ""wild"" water of unknown origin and content, then since Brita's own user manuals tell you it does NOT render such water ""safe"" I would trust them to know and wouldn't assume it does everything you'd need."

3825,best online college,I am curious does OSU list on the degree if its online. Usually they do this by listing a campus or something that does not physically exist.
44962,best items under $100,"A home network DNS.

In short, this blocks nearly all ads on every device on my home internet connection. It also blocks tracking. This goes well beyond what an adblocker on your computer browser can do - I no longer see ads in apps on my phone or on my Fire TV. It's a night and day difference.

I set mine up using Home Assistant running on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi. For anyone tech savvy, it really isn't difficult to configure. Additionally, since I did this via Home Assistant, I then also have the overwhelmingly best platform for home automation already set up. If you have a smart home and are currently using the automations built into a voice assistant, SmartThings, or anything else, it's shocking how much of an upgrade this is in your ability to automate your home - I have it set to do things that I never would have even imagined were possible before I started using it.

There are many ways to set up a home network DNS. Home Assistant just made the most sense for my use-case.

Edit: Specifically, I use AdGuard Home"

23205,best social networking site for CS,"You may be biting off more than you can chew.

Since it's something that will have quite a few real people using it right away, I'd budget at least twice that amount of time if I could.

Especially since you have no back end experience, it's going to be really difficult. Do you have any experience with DB schema design?

If I were you, I'd make some sort of attempt to crowdsource it. If you made the project public on github, I'd be interested in helping out."
