5070,"I like HD better in general, they have a deeper selection of products, tools, lumber and trim.  I like Behr paint a lot more than Valspar, and I like Ridgid tools a lot more than kobalt.

I go to Lowe's 95% of the time though, because I can take my dog on a leash and get her some exercise and social time, so unless I need paint or tools, Lowe's it is.

I've been trying to go to Ace/local lumber yard lately, but the lumber yard people are so rude, it feels like they do not want you there.  I love Ace stores, except they're so small I always have to go somewhere else to get everything I need.",best home improvement store

If on the other hand you're dealing with untreated ""wild"" water of unknown origin and content, then since Brita's own user manuals tell you it does NOT render such water ""safe"" I would trust them to know and wouldn't assume it does everything you'd need.",best water filter

44962,"A home network DNS.

In short, this blocks nearly all ads on every device on my home internet connection. It also blocks tracking. This goes well beyond what an adblocker on your computer browser can do - I no longer see ads in apps on my phone or on my Fire TV. It's a night and day difference.

I set mine up using Home Assistant running on Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi. For anyone tech savvy, it really isn't difficult to configure. Additionally, since I did this via Home Assistant, I then also have the overwhelmingly best platform for home automation already set up. If you have a smart home and are currently using the automations built into a voice assistant, SmartThings, or anything else, it's shocking how much of an upgrade this is in your ability to automate your home - I have it set to do things that I never would have even imagined were possible before I started using it.

There are many ways to set up a home network DNS. Home Assistant just made the most sense for my use-case.

Since it's something that will have quite a few real people using it right away, I'd budget at least twice that amount of time if I could.

Especially since you have no back end experience, it's going to be really difficult. Do you have any experience with DB schema design?
