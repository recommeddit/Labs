2576,best headphones,"They're a bit of a conundrum, aren't they? Sadly, I can't attest to them from personal experience, but [Tyll's review] (http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/two-strike-zone-focal-spirit-professional-and-spirit-classic) seems to imply that they're mediocre in comfort at best for long-term usage."

33779,best electric car,"Yeah... There are some better cost options coming to market. It's mainly battery supply problems limiting availability right now.

I think once they work out a way to really suck all the lithium out of Chile whilst vw and others bring their model on stream over the next couple of years, well see the tipping point."
69243,best major to study in college,"It's my understanding there isn't a huge difference between the two degrees.

40230,best midrange CPU,"The 3300x is just out, and every reviewer always starts with the 2080ti. But gamers nexus does have a small section in their review for GPU scaling and Hardware unboxed is probably going to dedicated a video on it soon.

Other then that finding actual realistic performance numbers is quite difficult since all cpu are paired with a 2080ti and all gpu's with a 9900ks at 5.2 ghz.

Try techepiphany, they recently released something that might be interesting for you"
