I'm starting to think you guys have a plethora of usernames relevant to every situation.
"I had a TERTIAL for a couple years, the bits that hold the ends of springs are made of very cheap plastic looking material. 4 of them on mine cracked and broken off spontaneously under the tension of the springs. Unless they fixed this quality control issue in recent years, I wouldn't recommend it."
Please put the fact that there is a spoiler *before* the spoiler itself.
PS4.  Sony is the best.
LPT: Free Books and eBooks. Visit your nearest library and check out the book that you want!
"What about reverse osmosis filtration? Does that remove the same things, or does it remove more or different impurities?"
"Snowpiercer

that shit is insane"
My vote is for Carowinds. They built 3 high quality coasters and turned their park into a real destination park.
"I don't know if I could make a Top 10. But one game I really like that consistently isn't making lists here is Spyfall. 
I've played it with people who ""don't play board games"" and they have a blast trying to give really bizarre answers that divert attention. My son loves answering questions in 2 words or less. We have a lot of fun in any crowd."
What makes you say that? Don’t want to drop $50 on it if there’s good reason not to!
"Agree, and wish someone told me this a decade or so ago. ""Research Associate"" and ""QA/QC tehnician"" are the most common jobs for a BS in chemistry/biology, but they cap out around 40k these days. It's hard to fidn these jobs too, because unless you go for an advanced degree, thats the only real jobs you qualify for."
"Not a dentist or hygienist. But I did go through an extensive period of tooth/mouth-care as result of bad choices in my younger years.

I had reconstruction done in Cancun and had extensive consultations with dentist/hygienists that weren't biased by North American ""marketing"". Avoid abrasive toothpastes, get yourself a good ultrasonic toothbrush, floss once or even twice a day.  

My particular problem was that my mouth goes dry at night due to the way I sleep. Once I started using dental appliances at night my gum health increased drastically so much so that when I stopped using those appliances I started using a mouthguard at night."
"> Maybe you can get the connectors but gen 2 C-C cables ?

What do you mean here? gen2 C-C cable would just plug into the connector for the angled connector for example. I assume that it's pass-through for negotiation on the cables e-marker chip, haven't tried one myself personally, just seen them for sale.

> Not sure how magnetic connectors got into this

For the same reason those expensive cables are being cited as worthwhile for their niche, providing alternative connector styles?

> mostly non-standard 

Yeah, anything not providing usb-c connectors is going to be non-standard/non-compliant afaik."
Site asks for an account if you want to download more than 5 titles. Is it safe to do so?
"Yeah, wow. I have learned so much in the past month. I now love and respect the waiting around part."
The Douglas fir.
"I completely agree. As a language it dying out, and it's shown by multiple metrics... But still its one of the most popular languages and this ""dying out"" will probably take over 5 years."
"I'm leaning towards switch, because of my love of nintendo, but I'm going to say ps4, because it's just better"
And/or? Definitely AND!
"Light one up and go to town. It's great! Or, if you've got a mom or grandma to watch it with, that's always fun (but old people have sex! haha could be awkward). My mom and I watch it together long distance. But really... try it out."
Am I gregnant?
"I swear if you people contaminate EVEN THIS SUBREDDIT with your disgusting american politics and racial wars and culture wars I'll just quit reddit outright. After 10 years on this site it's just not worth it anymore. 

How do we, normal people, explain to you maniacs that we don't even google the author let alone check their race and ethnicity before reading their book? How do I explain to you that we REALLY don't care what you do in your country? 

Like either talk about books or buzz off with your bullshit... instead of writing 10 comments you could've been constructive and written a review of those books and promoted them ,if you feel they aren't talked about enough.

I can't imagine the arrogance thinking that an international audience knows or cares about your nonsense obscure  issues..."
"My all-time favorite is CK Eternity Moment. I've been using it for over 10 years. It's not as heady as the original Eternity and it's a little fruitier because of the lychee note and the peony is just lovely. I've received the most compliments while wearing this one.

A close second is Lancome Miracle, which is a spicier version of the above. It's a wonderful fruity-floral scent.

A new top favorite is Jennifer Lopez's Still. I'm not a loyal fan of hers, but I was curious about this perfume because of the Earl Grey note. It's great if you want something light to wear that has some dimension."
fetch() is a PITA
"One thing I find really interesting about Byrd is him steering a lot of federal funds towards West Virginia. I lean right politically and don't like that. But at the same time, if I was from West Virginia, and my senator was fighting to make my state better in Congress like that especially considering it's a small state, I would LOVE him. So really, I respect that Byrd loved his state and would do anything for it."
