"Least fav currently is Khloe bc she’s so mean and hypocritical now. Fav was Kourtney bc I stan and underdog and that’s what she was with Kim and Khloe picking on her so much. I also appreciate that she hasn’t had as much work done and I’m not a huge fan of the plastic surgery/filler look. I hate the way she treats staff though, but most rich people do that shit, so maybe none of them are my fav now?"
"We did one of those in a bar after the US won a big World Cup game in 2010. Except we did the car bomb, followed by a jaeger bomb, followed by a pint of beer. Yea. The bar staff filmed it to put on their website, but the bar is closed now."
[Mont Blanc Legend Intense](http://www.montblanc.com/en-us/shop/fragrance/legend/legend-intense-eau-de-toilette100-ml-111195.aspx). It's so crisp and impeccably *fresh*. It's like if you died under a gutter and were reborn atop a mountain.
I completely forgot about hermit crabs. My brother and I had one as kids. I feel like it didn't live very long though.

"He most likely appreciated you not shouting ""Shut up Wesley"" at him."
"Before my uncle died of ALS he used to make ""Apple Pie Moonshine"" in his shed. I had heard of moonshine, but not this variety.

It was like drinking a warm slice of apple pie. Barely any bite, even though it was something like 150 proof. That was a dangerous jug he kept on his shelf."
"At Bonnaroo I met a chick that works with Jack White to some extent. She said her rolls with a posse of the 6-12 of the hottest, weirdest, creepiest, spookiest girls you could ever imagine. She also said he's really nice."
Good god man you've got a couple years worth of material to listen to

I felt The Lighthouse was tense from start to finish dunno if that can be classed
"As much as I love the first two Cloverfield movies, The Cloverfield Paradox was one of the worst things I've ever seen."
"I’m actually allergic to SLS and it’s a bitch finding products without it. 

It’s put in nearly every toothpaste, shampoo or soap for its foaming property, which people associate with “clean” but don’t realize it’s a harsh detergent. 

Orally, I get mouth ulcers if I use a toothpaste containing SLS more than once or twice. Topically, shampoos with SLS worsened my seborrheic eczema, until I figured out that it aggravated my skin too. 

But, people like that “cleaning” foam/lather, so it’s not going away."

"I did try it, but couldn't figure out the preview window of folders and files. I didn't try very hard though. And also nnn is only configurable with envvars, and that is pretty tedious as well. Lf was the easier choice, but might check out nnn again soon!"

Planet of No Return

All five books are by Harry Harrison. Super action packed. But are a product of their time. Be forwarned. Also, pretty much all of the stuff by H. Beam Piper. Also, The Gap Saga by Stephen R. Donaldson. That's pretty crazy. And if you want horror sci fi, go with Veniss Underground by Vandermeer. I can't recommend that book enough."
