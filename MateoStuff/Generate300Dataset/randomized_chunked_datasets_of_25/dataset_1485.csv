44387,best items under $100,"Okay.  A lesbian explained this to me quite clearly.  Women look at fingernails for these reasons: 

*  it's a general indicator of hygiene.  A man with clean fingernails probably brushes all his teeth and washes regularly.  
*  If things go well, those nails will probably touch her nether regions.  If they're dirty or snaggled, you may as well be kicking off foreplay with a used cat litter litter scoop.  
*  Trimmed and buffed nails are a sign of health, and an indicator or virility.  People with fragile nails don't have enough fat in their diets, nails can indicate exposure to certain toxins.... 
*  Few people are conscious of it, but there's a reason jewelry salespeople get manicures.  People subconsciously favor this without realizing it.  
*  This is classist, but people with rough, mangled hands are treated as less-thans because of the association with physical labor.  Your woodworking hobby can cost you career advancement opportunities because you give handshakes like you work on a crab boat.  A smooth handshake sends the message that you should be paid what you're worth.  

I've been a carpenter's assistant and I play guitar.  My fingertips are like little concrete pads most days, and I own an awesome manicure kit and keep them in check."

753,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,"I have tried all of them! And there are actually 36 flavors. Ice creams had to be made according to modern allergens, (dairy free, gluten free, nut free, etc.) so the 31 Flavors isn't so true anymore. 

My top three have to be:
1. Snickers
2. Nutty Coconut 
3. Love Potion No. 31
but I love Butter Pecan and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (too many choices!)."
