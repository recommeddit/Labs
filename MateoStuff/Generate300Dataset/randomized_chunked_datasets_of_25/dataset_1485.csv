44387,"Okay.  A lesbian explained this to me quite clearly.  Women look at fingernails for these reasons: 

*  it's a general indicator of hygiene.  A man with clean fingernails probably brushes all his teeth and washes regularly.  
*  If things go well, those nails will probably touch her nether regions.  If they're dirty or snaggled, you may as well be kicking off foreplay with a used cat litter litter scoop.  
*  Trimmed and buffed nails are a sign of health, and an indicator or virility.  People with fragile nails don't have enough fat in their diets, nails can indicate exposure to certain toxins.... 
*  Few people are conscious of it, but there's a reason jewelry salespeople get manicures.  People subconsciously favor this without realizing it.  
*  This is classist, but people with rough, mangled hands are treated as less-thans because of the association with physical labor.  Your woodworking hobby can cost you career advancement opportunities because you give handshakes like you work on a crab boat.  A smooth handshake sends the message that you should be paid what you're worth.  

I've been a carpenter's assistant and I play guitar.  My fingertips are like little concrete pads most days, and I own an awesome manicure kit and keep them in check.",best items under $100
