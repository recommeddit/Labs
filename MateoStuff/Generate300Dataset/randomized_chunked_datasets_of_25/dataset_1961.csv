8959,"In this age of ""ask your doctor if medication blah blah blah is right for you"", I'm amazed that people aren't a bit more skeptical of product claims. About 15 years ago suddenly almost all toothpastes claimed to whiten your teeth and control tartar and reduce gingivitis and freshen your breath and fight decay, all in one tube. I'm a dentist and I'm sure there are studies supporting these claims, but remember that manufacturers will exaggerate even the slightest purported benefit, however small, to get you to buy their product. Drug manufacturers have no problem massaging the data on something like statins to make them appear more effective, so it isn't a stretch to think that some data massaging is going on with toothpastes. Toothpastes help, but the action of the bristles is much more significant. The whitening claims are largely nonsense. The product is diluted with water right off the bat and it simply isn't on your enamel for a long enough period to have a whitening effect. If you hold a gun to my head, I guess I can look up some supporting studies, since this is r/science, but dental studies about toothpastes (dentrifices) are mind numbingly boring and I can hardly bring myself to even do a search.
