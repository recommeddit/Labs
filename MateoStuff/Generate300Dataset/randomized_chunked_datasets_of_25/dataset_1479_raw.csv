Love my headlamp. The red light mode is helpful too if you don't want to blind people
Well this if you pass your test first time.
"Visiting America next month for 2 weeks from England as well, going with three mates all 24.

We are visiting New York, San Franciso and Las Vegas. We have booked in a helicopter ride, have a hire car to drive from San Fran to Las Vegas and a trip round Alcatraz. Sounds entirely different to yours :P"

All my Mom really wants is a big family Christmas but I'm going to get her an old fashioned apple peeler which she's been asking for all year.
Sharp Objects was great! Nice difference was the protagonist wasn't a detective but a reporter. Fantastic show overall.
"I did the same when I started out. Definitely not ideal, but I had better engagement with that than if I’d had no camera at all."
"Maybe a team would do well in the salary cap era if they drafted the greatest of all time QB, safety, and WR all within the span of a few years.  You think maybe the talent scouting and revolutionary coaching had a lot more to do with their Super Bowls than the salary cap?  Look at what year the salary cap was implemented, and look which team won that Super Bowl if you want to take that route."
"Also, unless you have rich parents you're never going to afford a house anywhere remotely decent."
Isn’t this where pizza goes to die?
"The Christian Science Monitor is required to do one article per issue on religion, but other than that it’s the same as any other newspaper. They have impressive content and are my favorite."
"It took some time to write up, but it may help us avoid ""bro science""

I hope people read the ""how to read science journals"" stuff, as you waste way too much time trying to figure stuff out from the abstract if you are not current in the field.

I suggest the following order when you have the actual article.

[1] Read conclusion (this is what the well informed people think it means)

[2] Read the intro - they put background info in for people not fully current in their field.

[3] Read discussion - they talk about limitations of their study and warn of dangers of wrong interpretation."
Masters Of The Universe is completely brilliant and one of my all time favorite albums.
"Secondary Education (6-12 grade in the US). Will be either teaching English or social studies.

EDIT: Oh wow I did not expect this many replies. I should mention that I am actually a college Freshman who just got done with my first year. Not exactly a high Schooler but since I'm not in my major yet I just wanted to get some insight on those of you who are Education Majors or have an Education degree to some sort. EDIT 2: TIL I need to talk to my advisor again."
"I really liked Midnight Club 3: DuB Edition.  But I've been avoiding racing games as its one of the few racing games I've actually played.  I'll add it with more support, but someone else mention motorstorm too so it's looking like a possible addition shortly.

Edit: Also another reason I avoided racing games is that I tend to see that most racing game enthusiasts lean towards pc gaming.  Though this is not always true and I could have my perception all screwed up."
Going by that what the PL spent this season they could have bought all but 1 national team which is the England team...
"Your negative sounds like the textbook definition of ""literary"" SF, so some people may see that as a bonus."
If City get Bayern in the next round of CL we might find out!
"That's an interesting take, will have to read into it. From what I've read I've made assumptions and you're doing a good job challenging them :)."
yeah it was a joke
