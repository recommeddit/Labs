"Just had a glance, amazing review which seems to be very much in line with their key brand stand points. Obviously you have missed some race shoes for good reason, but not sure if you meant to miss the free rn commuter?

Either way, great review, thanks"
"Initially we got the cat for my oldest daughter who has autism. We heard about companion animals for people with autism and we decided to get a cat. My landlord has outdoor cat and my daughter would always go pet her. We can't have dogs our apartment but we can have cats, so thought she enjoy having her own. Besides, my daughter was afraid of dogs.

We went to the shelter and we found a cat that we wanted. When we got inside their little shelter room, he didn't want to be held or anything, which was fine for me, but it didn't seem like he would be a good *companion* for my daughter. In that same room was Nessa. My oldest daughter who we were getting the cat for didn't seem to feel anything towards any of the cats. Nessa was (and is) very affectionate and was all over my husband. My youngest daughter's eyes lit up with her and we decided she was the cat for our family. My youngest daughter treated her as her baby. She's the the one who gave her the most attention and fed her. She's a good pet owner and responsible."
"The White Mountains.

Other than that the rest of the Appalachians."
One of the guys is from Always Sunny too
"Hellsing was on 3 lists, and Hellsing Ultimate was on 2 lists.

One of the lists is from 2002 (the Animeboards poll), and Hellsing Ultimate didn't exist at the time."
"I haven't seen it, which is why it wasn't added. ;-)"
"I just ordered an Xbox One X because:

* best buck for real 4K (PS4 Pro has a fake 4K)
* future proof (my current TV is only Full HD, but soon I will have to change it)
* retro compatibility with 600+ games from Xbox and Xbox 360 and of course the current games
* When Xbox Series X comes out, I could play with my games enhanced due to ""Smart Delivery""

I have to state I don't have any console or PC gaming right now."
I personally like Benjamin Moore's Swiss Coffee.
The apostrophe. It doesn't mean what you think it means.

"Saddle brown leather case ever since the iPhone 7. It feels perfect in the hand, protects from every waist height fall Iâ€™ve taken them through, and ages beautifully."
"Took me about 20 minutes to install, but it could be faster if you have better tools.  Turn off water.  Flush a few times to empty toilet.  

Remove seat, place bidet attachment, replace seat.  This step is the biggest nuisance, honestly, but could be easy if you have a second set of hands; bidet is weighted to one side, so you have to hold it up, hold seat in place, align everything and screw it in.  Fiddle for about 5 minutes to get the positioning of the seat right.

Unscrew hose where it joins tank of toilet to wall (carefully, as there may be water in it), attach it to t-junction that comes in the box.  Attach t-junction to new bidet attachment via. the extra hose that came in the box.  This seems like a pain in the ass when you're facing it, but in retrospect the seat was more of a pain.

Turn water back on.  Carefully test putting your weight on it - you may want bumpers to support the front of the seat, depending on how it all fits together and the dimensions of your toilet seat (the bidet attachment lifts up the back of the seat by about a quarter inch to a half inch).

Got the thing for something like $35, went through the above hassle, totally worth.  I know it's weird to talk about toilet stuff, but it's a huge quality of life thing.  End up using only two sheets of toilet paper to pat dry, every time.  If you can't appreciate that, then you're not human."

"Donnie Darko was scary and unsettling as fuck. The descriptions just say ""He hallucinates a rabbit"" but that's not a fucking rabbit."
"Yes! Cold from the fridge or just stale, from sitting on the counter in the box from last night?"
"I still think Cannibal Ox is El's best production, though I'm stoked people are loving his new shit."
Well I'm out of suggestions haha.
"That's a pretty good list: I added blindsight and ancillary justice to my reading list, having never heard of either one.

I'd add Childhoods End and Way Station and Stranger in a Strange Land, if you're building a reading list."
"I have been in a very similar situation. I got back into reading by listening to audiobooks. Once you are hooked on a particular series, finding motivation to read wont be hard. You can change over to regular books then, or you can stay with the audiobooks. 

I personally prefer audiobooks for late-'reading', since you can close your eyes and turn of the light. 

I recommend The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher. There are a lot of them and they are read by James Marster (whitehaired vampire from Buffy)
If u have been watching Game Of Thrones, the audiobooks made for those are also really good. 
Write me if you want more/different reccomendations..

Also make an account on Goodreads, book reviews, database, forums, ratings, etc etc.. everything you might need is there."
"I'm a mom and I much prefer time spent together rather than a regular gift. Dinner is nice, but so is a cool show... And this time of year there's always some sort of holiday music or play. It's just nice to be out with the people you love."
Another poor honey junkie.
YNAB
It is the best distro so that explains it  ðŸ˜Ž
"Then Iâ€™m out of excuses! Will have to play with swapping that out sometime. One of those things that just works for me, but probably worth factoring out and removing unnecessary bloat."
Fraid not. I did get cheap motorbikes though. I was 25 and it was the best time of my life
