15884,best sunglasses for fashion,"Cheap knockoff wayfarers. 

There are guides on the sub on sunglasses. Go with what looks good on you rather than the current trend."
45971,best trick or treating candy,Pennies.  If you hate kids.

24982,best spiderman actor,Tom because he thicc af
52139,best iphone case,"Tech 21 cases are what I've used exclusively for the past year, and I used to buy two or three cases every month. They provide great protection, I like the way that they look, and they don't ever get that dirty or look worn. Can't say enough good things about them, especially the Evo Mesh series for the 6."
20028,best workout music,Three or four good tunes in there.
72856,best Linux distro,"FUTURE PLANS FOR POSTS/REVISIONS:
- write more about each distro - maybe a first impressions of each one, or a review for each
- pen a little about the overlap that currently exists between all the distros
- make revisions to this list to add more categories such as `small installs`, maybe make a tagged gallery of distros on a separate page. `Windows-like UI`, `Mac-like UI`, etc."
48442,best color to paint with,"Exactly this. Those houses look like every single episode of Flip of Flop, gray walls, white trim, shaker cabinets, subway tile backsplash, whatever flooring they could get for cheap that passes for wood, same with the discount counter tops, oh and don’t forget the light fixture above the kitchen sink that someone got with a coupon at the home depot. They all look identical, and they all look boring as hell. There’s nothing wrong with any of the elements that I listed, but at this point they’re so generic as to signal to me that someone either a) flipped the house quickly and probably missed important details, or b) flipped the house poorly because they’re new to flipping and want to make a profit without really knowing what they’re doing. Either way, someone wants me to pay for their boring, generic “upgrades” that I’ll have to redo to make the house into something that I actually want to live in."
45333,best gaming system,"Mhm well those games are not really in the scope. Wil be more along the lines of pokemon, mariocart and other kiddie games"
73093,best Linux distro,"Although I've migrated to Arch(btw), Manjaro is the distro I'd recommend to any friend or acquaintance. 

Reason? It just works out of the box and has almost everything one would ever need. Their themes look great without the need to tinker(especially the Gnome one). Manjaro's store is amazing and makes AURs easy to use (I don't use snaps)."
41247,best instrument to play,"Pan Flute. I love that airy, ancient sound."
69379,best major to study in college,That's why I just switched from Engineering to Biology. I didn't enjoy it enough.
55918,best action and adventure movie,"But at the same time, the action movie genre is oversaturated with bathos. It's a strange paradox, action movies seem to take themselves both too seriously and not seriously enough at the same time. We don't seem as able to strike a good balance anymore like action movies in the 80s and 90s did."
19976,best workout music,The patient by tool is one of my favorites
54818,best water filter,Exactly what i was looking for! Thanks so much! I felt like the RO would be overkill for my city water but am more concerned with the organic compounds. It seems like so many filters claim the same things but performance widely varies. Appreciate you sharing your research!
45823,best trick or treating candy,Mmmmmmolasses! Love that stuff.
52492,best hiphop album,All Eyez On Me-2Pac and Paid In Full-Eric B & Rakim are good to start with.

62979,Best Data Science textbook,"wow thats a steal! Thanks for the recommendation, and ill see if learning spark, and hadoop: def guide are on sale elsewhere (most of the others are still foreign to me). Good luck with your project - doesnt sound boring at all!"
62164,Best RPG game on PS4,"Definitely Nier Automata if you haven't, and haven't played Final Fantasy 7 Remake but heard some good things about it !"
53837,best medicine for a cold,"Get a red onion and slice it thinly.  Stack the slices in a deep container and cover it with honey.  Let it sit a few hours, then mix the liquid that comes out into ginger tea with some fresh lemon juice.  Whiskey optional."
4866,best home improvement store,"It's more on things like getting lumber cut when they're even slightly busy.    


I said fuck it and bought a circular saw for a fence repair project recently and now I don't have to waste my time trying to track down the mysterious solo employee who is responsible for doing cuts."
