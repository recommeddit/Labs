He obviously busted his ass off, but you can do it in...
[Stars and Stripes Forever with tuba playing piccolo solo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmFYgc-Emmc)|[+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/6b0ayu/_/dhjl1i5?context=10#dhjl1i5) - One, five, one, five, one all day long isn't really fun. Wagner has great tuba parts. Berlioz is pretty awesome, so is Stravinsky...  But usually tuba doesn't get good lines. Maybe in brass or jazz bands? Also, they're expensive as hell.   Well, they...
(1) [Brass Quintet No. 1 in B-Flat Minor, Op. 5: I. Moderato](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XXyrcmOKps) (2) [Penderecki - Capriccio for Solo Tuba (Audio+Score)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-NkYMRUQvs)|[+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/6b0ayu/_/dhjmchv?context=10#dhjmchv) - And the tuba is rarely used as such outside of bad band music. Composition had generally moved past that kind of harmonic simplicity before the tuba was even invented! The tuba holds down the bass on so many incredible brass moments in late Romantic ...

36675,best alcoholic drink,"Sweet drinks like:

* White Russians -- Kaluha (coffee liqueur) + heavy cream or half & half + vodka
* Dessert beers or Stouts (think coffee and chocolate flavors, but not as sweet)
* Mead (super sweet fruit wine)
* Prosecco -- a sweet, bubbly white wine
* ACE Pineapple cider
* Hard apple ciders
* Rumchata (tastes like Horchata, basically. Or cinnamon toast crunch if you're not familiar with Mexican horchata)"

51926,best iphone case,I thought most people go for the saddle brown colour because of the nice patina?
63450,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Does truecuts or stopshortcutsnotifications work on iOS 14?
68346,best science fiction novel,"Only about 450 pages to go... just kidding. Probably 600.

Love that book, though."
25630,best cricket teams of all time,"wow.  brilliant work.  this is probably better than any ranking system i've seen over the years.  any way to extend this to rank individual players?

and which team would be the best ODI team in history?  my money is on cronje's team around '96-99."
11129,best backpack for college,"Could you take a minute to point out specifics what makes Mission Workshop better than Chrome? I've heard this sentiment a lot, but I haven't had the opportunity to see MW in person to compare."
37629,best Marvel movie,"It's not just people thinking its overrated. A lot of people on this sub were actively bitter over Black Panther's success so they called it ""overrated"" and ""not that great"" in any discussion about the film.

People are entitled to their opinion of course but no other marvel movie gets this treatment, this sub generally appreciates all of them but was dreading BP getting nominated for Best Picture at the oscars."
20287,best workout music,"Thanks for the idea friend

11427,best gifts for dad,"I usually just clean up my dads truck for him since he is always talking about how he wants to really detail his truck. Maybe bring him some dairy queen and hang with him all day. If its nice, go hits some baseballs."
30255,best Mexican war to study,"I remember something about the president sending an army to the border in the hopes that they would encounter the Mexican army and war would break out by virtue of the two armies being near each other.

I think the end goal was to get San Francisco.

I have no idea how accurate this is though."
44011,best items under $100,Everyone should carry a swiss army knife.

14052,best place to get free books,Lpt: pay for a premium vpn if you don't like the free ones that are all complete garbage cumdumpsters
37560,best amusement park,"I mean, being honest BGT mainly has rides that go upside down and they yet don’t have an air time focused ride, neither does IOA but in my opinion hurts it a lot. I would rather ride Mako than 99% of the coasters at BGT, Tigris being the only one I’d take i think."

2744,best headphones,"gosh I wish I came across this earlier. About to throw my g933 into the bin and back to wired. The headset is such a joke, the sound gets crackling when there are more than 2 audio sources running and constantly disconnect too. Thank you for this post!"
