Will have to look into that have tried pretty well every drug possible.
"Haruhi at number 10! I feel kinda vindicated after years of people trying to convince me it wasn't that great anymore.

Also Utena at 3 is really cool, wouldn't have expected that at all (though I was certain it would be on this list)."
"He said much more; you’re only using one line to support an argument.  

Grant said the following .... “I’m opposed to the war as it would bring in new slave supporting territories; in opposing the measure felt the war was unjustifiable” 

However he also went on to write that subsequent Union victory in the civil war admonished the Mexican secession.  

Grant would go on to lead the industrialization of those lands he felt were so wrongly acquired..... lining his coffers. 

One fact remains he benefited from two North American Wars; without those wars .... he’s a drunk and a debtor."
"In the university I work at we use Zoom and people really don't care as as long as they can be seen and heard.

Same goes for good quality microphones."

I agree but I feel it's much better because it doesn't have HMS( I know s and m also didn't have) and we had a pc that's anytime accessible and Pokemon camp is my dream come true and overworld Pokemon are also good and I don't care about dexcut because I only play with Pokemon in that region and the music is damn good and I like the artstyle
Jomashop has great deals on RayBans
"Imagine a fist-sized wad of that sweet-and-salty kettle corn with enough sweet stuff to hold it together. There are some commercially prepared, individually packaged. Go find one, and enjoy."
Anywhere on the AT.  From what I've heard its easier in the north but you'll want to wait till spring/summer because hiking in snow is a bitch.
i end up smiling all the time watching that video
Val Kilmer.  He seems like a dude you would like to have as a neighbor.
"I was really hoping I'd see this here. I LOVE picklebacks, but no one has any idea what the fuck I'm talking about when I try to get it at a bar, and they stare at me like I'm insane.

So *so* delicious, but oh so dangerous."
Yes! Recently got a $30 water bottle and it's so much nicer than drinking from the disposable soft plastic ones.
For me T-Mobile was pretty bad at Keesler and non-existent at Offutt. Verizon has been great everywhere I've tried it.
"Which is why Economics is not and will never be Psychohistory. But when talking on the large scale, the numbers are pretty damn useful, if not for predicting (as so many laymen expect of the discipline), most definitely for *understanding*."
"No one really talks about it, but I found This Book is Full of Spiders to be much better written than John Dies at the End."
Craziest hotel story?
"new old iPhone7
iPhoneSE new gen?"
"I respect ya opinion.... but both these niggas are not classified as 'definitive hip-hop artists'

"Streamer connects to own stream while streaming

"You could very well still have it in your top list even if you listened to 1000 albums. 

Some of my favorite projects this year haven’t been very loved."
"I think ultramale is sweeter than eros. In the sweet part of fragrances I think ultramale is one of the best, imo"
