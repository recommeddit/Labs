"Whatever you feel comfortable with, it’s not gonna make that big of a difference"
"I don't really consider LinkedIn to be social media, even though it seems to want to try to be. To me it's an employment resource for making it easier to apply to jobs, contact recruiters, and search.

Indeed isn't social media at all, and just flipping the ol' privacy switch to ""Public"" seems to start the calls and emails flowing in."
"Why is sci-fi obsessed with ""essentials""? Why can't you just read books in the sci-fi genre without having someone try to force a bunch of old books down your throat?"
"Yes, moderns! I've read pretty much all the classic scifi and loved it at the time, but I think the stuff coming out now is even better. Granted, they wouldn't have been able to exist without influence from the classics. Swap out Dune with Ancillary Justice and I'm right there with you!"
"Thanks very much to all for the suggestions, you guys are awesome"
"Terry Crews is the absolute motherfucking best, ever, in the history of everything, period"
"Depends on what you mean by ""cheap"".

You can get nearly identical glasses to $200 raybans for like $30 from china."
Seems like they haven't sold them in a few years.
This is more like the answer I came here for.
The basement of the Alamo is better.
"> and handles images a lot simpler than Excel.

I think that phrase might be the absolute perfect distillation of the different audiences"
"Ahh yea I can see that; I almost added Midwest in there, but it seemed so broad as to be cheating, lol. Totally agree on the regional similarities."
"Yeah I looked into the Rivian. Too expensive and it’s a startup without a track record of reliability or ability to build enough in sustained numbers. I’m a fan, but not ready to trust them yet. 

If the ID4 was significantly cheaper I would consider it, but it starts at the same price as the Lightning without the towing package and has less range, doesn’t have some of the features of the Lightning like exterior plugs. So at that point I might as well go with a Ford. At this point I’d pay more and end up with something less capable."
"wreck, it's the one with the fewer dependencies and async/await based"
When The Levee Breaks - Led Zeppelin. That song gets me in the mindset to get shit done.
The Virgin Infographics Show vs. The Chad Kurzgesagt
"I live in southern Ontario, right across the border from Detroit. Friends, family and the cottage are north and north east of Toronto, roughly 700km away. There also aren't that many ev chargers the further north you go.

Do I like them? Yeah they're pretty cool.
Are the feasible in my situation? Not really.

If anything I'd need a second vehicle for longer trips up north, or even a hybrid over a full ev.

My dad came by with a rental Ford fusion Hybrid the other day. It was pretty slick and with an electric range of 80km would be perfect for the daily commute/ puttsing around town, and when it switches to gas would be best for the road trips. One day when charging/range is better, or I can afford the luxury of a second car, I'd go full ev. Until then, it wouldn't work."
another thing that works is the end of the zip tie

My god that’s embarrassing
"Treat yourself! Buy some just for at-home use. I have a couple really nice pens that live in my desk, I use them exclusively at home. It's a pleasure to do work with super nice pens and incentivizes me to actually sit at my desk and use them :)"
Decadence by Marc Jacobs is my current go-to. It’s sensual and musky and has nice sweet undertones.
I used to be a Sobe Adrenaline Rush junkie.  I'd supplement that with Amp from time to time.  Then I stopped drinking all sodas and energy drinks.
