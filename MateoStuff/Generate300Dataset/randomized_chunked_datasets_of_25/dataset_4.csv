Between Fury and CS's night rides, that awesome stomp band, and the general look and feel of the place, I loved it. My only complaint was that damn cannonball sound effect that kept grating on my ears.",best amusement park

The guy that spends his free time building up a home lab at home and writing code for open source projects is probably going to do a better job than the guy that views tech as a way to make a lot of money, but then doesn't put in any effort outside of work.

I've noticed it a lot when I interview. Confidence + eagerness to learn + seeming excited about the job are the things that seemed to have the biggest impact on receiving an offer.",best major to study in college

69886,"That's exactly my case. I started programming to learn to make games, realized that doing it for a job wasn't a great idea, became a developer, eventually stopped doing it for a job, but all the while I kept game dev as a hobby and still enjoy it even if I don't make any money from it.

Edit: Just want to clarify: I don't see game development as a lesser job. I know people who truly enjoy the job. Hell, John Carmack is one of my idols. I just realized early on that I personally did not want that career.",best major to study in college
33845,"You could try Black or White. An issue that a group of people have with the games is that it doesn't have Pokemon from older games present through the main story but since you're new to the franchise, that's not really a big deal. After that, assuming you enjoyed either game, you could move on to Black 2 or White 2 (sticking with the same color for story reasons) which *do* feature older Pokemon throughout the main story.",best Pokemon game

69611,"An associate's degree in general studies from a community college before transferring to a university is not a bad way to go, especially if you use a lot of AP and early enrollment credits from high school. It can save one a lot of money. They transfer really well to the state universities, actually having the associates degree (as opposed to just a bunch of credits) helps with making sure that all the credits are accepted as transfer. But doing it because of indecisiveness or to anything beyond an associate's degree is never a good move.",best major to study in college
15960,"Certainly not. They are higher quality, but the slight edge in durability won't make a difference if you step on them or drop them on asphalt (or worst of all, lose them).

On the other hand, polarized lenses are definitely well worth the upgrade over non-polarized lenses. Thankfully you can get perfectly decent polarized sunglasses on Amazon for $10 or less.",best sunglasses for fashion

37530,"For sure. IMO Over Texas has a more well rounded lineup than Fiesta Texas, but Fiesta Texas is a better looking park. Too bad FT forgot the shade.

I'd rather have Shock Wave than Superman, Mr. Freeze than Poltergeist, Superman than Scream... Wonder Woman has no comparison, but both parks have a Freespin, a Discovery, a Batman Clone, a Pandemonium, a Hybrid (I rank them pretty evenly, Rattler is too short to be better than NTG). Also despite Road Runner Express being a better coaster, Runaway Mine Train is well themed and has massive historical value. La Vibora, Titan, and Judge, also have no comparison to any rides at Fiesta Texas.",best amusement park

28892,"Meal prep. 

I suggest a breakfast burrito. 
I do a tortilla, egg whites, low fat cheese, salsa, and spinach one. Sometimes you can add a meat like sausage or something. 
Cook and prepare, put them in the freezer and take one out the night before and pop it on the microwave for 60 seconds before you leave. 

I also suggest oatmeal. Portion it out in a to go container or do the instant if you need to. Pour hot water in it, go brush your teeth or hair or whatever and it's done. Sometimes I add a little peanut butter. 

If you have more time than that on your hands you can't go wrong with eggs. Scrambled eggs, add some cheese or something and add hot sauce for more flavor. 5 minutes.",best breakfast foods
