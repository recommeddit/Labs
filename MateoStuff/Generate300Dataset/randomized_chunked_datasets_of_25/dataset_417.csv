73557,best battery bank,"I have the middle one ($23.99) and I love it. It's fast via both outputs and charges pretty fast. When I travel, I pretty much charge with that since it moves around so easily. If I even need to recharge it, it charges fast."
31050,best country to live in,"It depends a little bit if you're asking about warmest temperature in general, or warmest average temperature. For average values then yes - the oceanic flow keep the winters mild in Denmark, but also prevent extremely hot summers. Due to its more inland location however, the summers in the interior regions of Finland can get significantly hotter than the rest of Scandinavia (30+ from what I've read). On the flipside, the winters are also way harsher than in the coastal areas. 

And yes, the bike paths get salted and cleared of snow when needed. They are generally well-maintained... The Road Directorate runs a machine over it regularly, which uses laser to identify unevenness in the surface due to root damage or potholes (I'm not an engineer though, so I don't know too much of the technical details... I just thought it was cool that they used laser to identify bike path potholes heh).

Also, Key West is awesome! I fell in love with the quirky atmosphere when I visited a few years back. Someone told me that the Keys declared independence when someone tried to make them pay for use of the bridge. I have no idea if the story is true, but it perfectly captures the mood of the place to me :)."

55373,best action and adventure novel series,"Shards of Honor is really an outlier in the series. I think it’s probably the weakest book out of all of them. I always suggest new readers start with Barrayar because it’s a better introduction to the series and the recurring cast of characters. 
Cordelia and Aral take a backseat once Miles is born and then all the fun shenanigan start. Don’t judge the series based on Shards of Honor. It’s nothing like the rest of the series."

9402,best toothpaste,"Definitely this. I didn't used to floss because it hurt. When I got older and my teeth got shitty, I started flossing, and it didn't hurt at all. Even with sensitive, bad gums. The trick? 

Good floss (glide, baby!), and GENTLY shimmy it between the teeth, then pull it so the floss cups as much of the surface of the tooth as you can, then pull the other way to get as much of the surface on the adjacent tooth. And don't forget to floss the backs of your back-most molars, they need it too!

My only problem is I tend to drool on myself. frik

 Also, make sure to brush for at least 2 minutes (but no more then 3). Get a stopwatch on your phone and time yourself, you're probably not doing it long enough. It's an easy habit to make so make it when you can. Soft-bristle brushes, and use the same pressure you might use to polish a tomato. No whitening toothpastes. If you're going to use mouthwash, don't use Scope it's trash. Something like Listerine, the ADA accepted ones, nothing fancy. If you do wanna get fancy, include ACT mouthwash. Again, the simple one, ADA accepted. Time yourself.

Oh and also get Xylitol mints for after meals/snacks/etc. It lowers the pH in your mouth which makes it harder for bacteria to grow and strengthens the teeth. Plus it's tasty. 

Is...is it obvious I developed severe teeth/dentist anxiety? Don't care. This is the best-of-the-best tips/info I found when I was freaked about it, and it's what I use. Also brush at least twice a day, preferably three times after each meal. But wait about 30min, and/or pop a xylitol mint then brush. Brushing too soon after a meal can cause damage to the teeth, since the acidity of your meal weakens the enamel slightly. Reduce/avoid soft drinks, and don't sip sweet drinks throughout the day."

219,best terminal file manager reddit,"I too am a mostly-in-the-shell sorta guy.  If I need to act on filenames that don't follow any pattern (e.g. images that are just ""IMG_####.JPG"" or MP3 files where I want to delete ""uninteresting"" ones where I can't target them with a file-glob), I'll pipe the filenames to `vim`, transform them to the shell commands I need, and then pipe that through `sh`.  E.g.

    $ ls *.mp3 | vim -
    [delete the lines I don't want to change]
    :%s@.*@mv ""&"" ../path/to/dest/""&""
    :%!sh

If there's some discernible pattern that doesn't suit a glob, or the resulting command can be done with a regex, sometimes I'll use `sed` instead of `vim`:

    $ find . -name '*.mp3' | sed 's@\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\)-\([0-9][0-9]\)-\([0-9][0-9]*\)\(.*\)@mv ""&"" ""../archive/\1/\2/\3/\4""@' | sh

(I usually start by omitting the final `| sh` to double-check the commands that will be run, then recall the command and tack on the `| sh` to actually perform the actions)

Alternatively, I'll occasionally use the DIRED mode of `lynx` do tag a bunch of files to delete

    $ cd ~/Podcasts
    $ lynx .
    [tag a number of boring-sounding items using ""t""]
    [use ""r"" to remove them]"
