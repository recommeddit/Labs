Is there anything left to ask for at this point ?
"Edge chromium, a lot of features coming and available, low resource usage and also new privacy options"
Daniel Sloss - Live Shows. Not for the super religious and easily offended though. üò¨üëç
Was going to say the same thing. Nothing beats HHN
"Sounds useful but also a tad odd, I wouldn't feel comfortable knowing someone else could see when I opened emails and how many times as well as which ones"
"Why do all toothpastes have the word ""dent"" at the end of them?


I'm genuinely curious."
The only right answer.
"Yeah, and I suppose availability of facilities also plays a role. Cricket isn't a cheap game to either learn or teach. Till some time back most of the Indian team used come from Bombay, Madras and Bangalore (as those three were known as then) despite them accounting for about 0.02% of the total population."
I read somewhere that he divorced his wife after she gave him a kidney. Thats just cold..
This guy saved for 6 months to buy a 360 in 2020. There's gotta be more lucrative marks out there
"Well, for one thing, it's deprecated."
"If you‚Äôre making a Six Flags super park, your only real invert option is Batman: The Ride from any park."
"Echoing the comments of both /u/rean2 and /u/chattymcgee.  

7 Habits is great for top-down thinkers - define your personal mission, vision, and values; then make decisions about where to spend your time based on that.

Getting Things Done is better for bottom-up thinkers - what are all the commitments you've made; what's the very next thing you can do to move each of them forward; and what tools/people/places are necessary to perform that action.  Once you have all of that written down, you can start to examine why (or if) these things are meaningful to you so you can prioritize."
I have a Patagonia plqvk chupacabra (not actually that but close) and it is really nice and looks good in black.
Dude trop is like the worst place to live.
"I work as a film and TV extra for extra money while in grad school. By and large most actors/actresses are nice enough but in my experience there were two that stood out.

Keegan Michael-Key is ridiculously nice. Usually as an extra it‚Äôs understood that you NEVER approach an actor while on set for any reason or you will be asked to leave. It seems harsh but it‚Äôs important to remember that an extra is supposed to be a piece of scenery and causing the talent to lose their focus may cause the production to lose hours of time and a lot of money. In spite of this in between shooting he made an effort to joke around with us and act like a regular guy. Afterwards he personally took the time to thank everyone in the crew and the extras something that I have never seen any actor do before or since.

Conversely Rami Malek was probably the biggest asshole I have ever had the displeasure of working next to. The first shot of the day was supposed to be of his character walking down the stairs into a hacking competition. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs however he took it upon himself the stop and yell at the PAs that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs too many fucking people here‚Äù and demand that they re stage. He would also talk to the creator of the show about the PAs right in front of them and lament that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù. Apparently it‚Äôs well known that he‚Äôs a bit of a jerk though because we were told upon starting to ‚Äújust stay out of his way‚Äù. It‚Äôs also worth noting that for this shoot many of the extras were fans of the show who had no previous experience extraing and didn‚Äôt know you weren‚Äôt supposed to approach the talent. After seeing what a baby he is most of them didn‚Äôt bother him but two guys in between filming went over to him and Carly (a costar whose last name I can‚Äôt remember) and said what big fans of the show they were. Carly seemed nice enough and thanked them but told them that it wasn‚Äôt totally appropriate to approach her while working but Malek just turned around and stared at the wall behind him as soon as the two guys started to try and speak to him.

Overall most actors/actresses are ok and just like anybody else just want to get their work done but as in all professions there are some jerks."
PLease switch out Darling for any of those amazing honorable mentions. Banana fish gets no love.
"Any new iPhone will get you at least that many years. The 12 mini will be closest to your current form factor. I had a 12 pro and ‚Äúdowngraded‚Äù to the new SE because I just was a bit nervous having $1,000 in my pocket. It is fine for me. I am the same way you are with social media, camera, and apps. I would wait to see what they release in September. They may have a new mini that would suit you well. If you want something bigger, the regular 12 (or 13) non-pro would work. 

I used to work at Apple, so I‚Äôm a big fan."
Evil Genius is nuts and has stuck with me for a long time.
Huh. I've honestly never heard of anyone refer to or think of Brown as a top 10 school.
Dasani. Tastes like cigarette ash.
"Lowe's. I live in a smallish town outside of a larger city. Lowe's is the only home improvement store in town. There's a Menards about 15 minutes down the road on the outskirts of the larger city but it's a fucking hassle to find anything there. Even using their app to find a single specific item and clicking on the maps the thing is like ""well that item could be in one of these eight places around the store."" Really? I just redid my master bathroom and got maybe 3 small things there I couldn't find at Lowe's. Their vanity selection was actually pretty poor (everything was super expensive and I couldn't find any major quality differences from the ones at Lowe's). Home depot is a half hour away in the middle of the city and I'm not dealing with traffic and an hour commute unless I need something today that Lowe's and menards both don't have. I don't even try going to Ace. It's in the middle of the city right near a massive Bass Pro and I'm down to deal with that shit less than Home Depot."
"When in St. Louis, his hometown, John Goodman used go to strip clubs on the east-side and tried to tip the dancers in coupons from a restaurant where he is part owner.


Edit:  I don't believe John Goodman is particularly a dick.  I have also met him in Vegas and he was a very nice guy.  His actions at the strip club were in my opinion a little funny...the girls working there had a different opinion."

Excellent resources!  Any chance you could add Google Fi to the list?
