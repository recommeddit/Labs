Forza (Motorsport) is the original and afaik from what little i’ve played it’s very much focused on track racing, similar to Gran Turismo. your main focus is to win. it’s realistic compared to horizon.

horizon is the little brother and it’s a little more casual and opening. rather than being locked-in track racing, horizon focuses on open world racing, driving around, discovering landscapes, owning businesses, owning houses, and some mini games too (there’s a battle royale kinda mode, tag, team death match sorta mode)

i’ve only played motorsport 7 a little, but it seems pretty fun. i’ve dumped hundreds of hours into horizon 4 and it’s easily one of my favourite games of all time.",best car racing video game
45014,"A couple dumbbells. You don’t need much equipment to work out, so a couple 20 pound dumbbells is enough to gain muscle and get looking good. Also I got a book called “men’s health big book of exercises” for somewhere around $20 and it taught me so much about building muscle and it made me realize everything I was doing wrong when working out. The book was pretty life changing for me as well",best items under $100

36867,"Great Adventure is my home park. It operated about 20% of the time so it wasn't a valuable addition for many of the years it stood. Most guests never eveb had the chance to ride it because of its constant issues. And while TDK technically took over part of its real estate, it's not as if it was meant to replace Chiller. One was a hardcore thrill coaster and the other is a family ride. By that point Great Adventure had a lot of other thrill coasters and it can be argued KK and El Toro more than adequately filled the void left behind. 

I'm not saying TDK is an awesome ride but to hate on it for not being Chiller doesn't make sense to me.",best roller coaster at six flags
