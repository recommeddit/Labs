1604,"Olive and Basil.

Effectively basil flavoured with olive chunks mixed in right at the end. Also added some pine nuts for texture which worked really well. The salty olives + sweet icecream worked quite well together, but keep the olive chunks small if you're going to do this... its kinda gross if they're too big.

I think it'd work quite well with caramel in there, as caramel + salt tends to be a good combo.",best ice cream flavor
