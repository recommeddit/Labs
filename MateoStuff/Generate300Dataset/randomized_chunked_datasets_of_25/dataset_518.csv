5113,"Just here to ask everyone, no matter what your opinion of the retail company, the store, the brand, etc., that in the midst of everything that is going on try to remember that these retail employees are just folks like the rest of us. 

But with one big difference that you might not be thinking of: 

You'll make the trip to the store today, practice some social distancing, mask if you can, be mindful of what you touch, get your purchases and head home having come into close contact with no more than a dozen or so strangers. And you may only have to do that once or twice a week.

Retail employees are in these stores every day, eight hours per shift, encountering probably around a thousand strangers every shift, limited opportunity to distance, sanitize, mask, etc. For some it's quite stressful. They have families too, with loved ones they want desperately to protect.

What your area of study is in also matters. Biomechanics and motor behavior are probably the most lucrative in terms of careers since there's so much application to rehabilitation, device design, robotics, etc. Exercise physiology and the like not so much.",best major to study in college

420,"I have Thunar since it's part of my xfce setup, but I only use it as an alternative for when I'm in a mouse-heavy workflow. However, I've found it to work pretty well using just the keyboard sometimes.  
As my main file manager, I really like ""lf"". It's similar to Ranger and other terminal-based, miller column, vim-like, file managers, but it's more minimalist by default and was much faster than Ranger in my experience. It's deliberately lacking some features (like tabs) that can be handled better in other ways (I personally use i3 tabbed windows.) It's very customisable but the project wiki has lots of good documentation and easy tips to expand functionality, so I think it's good even for a beginner. Ranger and other more complex file managers confused me when I first tried them because they just covered too much ground, whereas lf starts more sane and simple, allowing you to build it up to your own preferences.",best terminal file manager reddit
