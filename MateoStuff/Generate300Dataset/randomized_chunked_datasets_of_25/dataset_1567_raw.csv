"Hey, I have a similar taste in Movies like you :D Here are some that I watched already, with a Comment from me:
""Identity"" from 2003 with John Cusack and Ray Liotta. Quite good. Not perfect, but a good Film.
""Mindgame"", an Anime Movie from 2004. That Film is really crazy. In a awesome Way.
At this point I have to recommend the criminally overseen ""Mr.Nobody"" from  2009. It's one of my All-time Favourite Movies, with Jared Leto in the lead Role. Stunning and really, really complex. Sadly it flopped hard.
""Being John Malkovich"" from Spike Jonze. Didn't like it too much, but a decent Film.
Try ""Brazil"" from Terry Gilliam, an absolute Blast!
""Vanilla Sky"" with Tom Cruise. Pretty good Movie, the Endtwist is great.
As for Comedies like ""Airplane"", I would recommend you the ""Hot Shots"" Movies, with Charlie Sheen and ""Top Secret"" with Val Kilmer.  Comedy Gold! :D"
"It's a pretty tough read, but after getting over the semantics, I gotta say, it was one of the best novels i've read in a while."
"Thank you for such a detailed response, I love seeing everyone’s thoughts on each persons it’s great! I love Scott too such a funny guy who has brought so much entertainment to the show!"
"That can only put out 18w of power, not nearly enough for what I want. I can't use a charger like that to keep a laptop charged whilst using it."
"About a month ago, my dog caught the cord on my laptop. It knocked off and broke half of the keys. I can't get them back on. I am currently typing with the squishy rubber parts that were under the keys. I would love a pad or new laptop."
I loved the Sphere. The ending bothered me on first view but when you re-watch the movie it all comes together.
"The University of California is also the most welcoming to war criminals.

John Yoo wrote the ""torture memos"" declaring torture to be just peachy keen and perfectly legal.  He also gave the OK for indefinite detention of enemy combatants.

He's now a Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley.

Yoo also authored the October 23, 2001 memo asserting that the President had sufficient power to allow the NSA to monitor the communications of US citizens on US soil without a warrant (known as the warrantless wiretap program) because the Fourth Amendment does not apply. Or, as another memo says in a footnote, ""Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations.""

In case you're wandering what law students at UC are learning....."

"You probably have a solid 40-50 hours of content without really any need to pay. And there is a huge content drop happening in roughly a little over a week that adds a whole new continent. The only reason to drop money is because you really want a character, but the game does a decent job at giving you everything you possibly need. And there are guides out there that can show you how to excel with a F2P team. There is a lot to do and explore before taking on the “end-game” which is pretty much only Spiral Abyss (think kind of like an endless dungeon where you keep fighting until you lose). But since there is no PvP, there isn’t an incentive beyond that to pay."

"This isn't how I learned it in my middle and high school. We learned that is was a brazen act of imperialism and we basically just stole Mexico's land because we could. I also learned there were a lot of opponents to this act. I believe Lincoln and Henry Thoreau are the two I remember specifically. I was taught it within the context of Manifest Destiny and our general western expansion. I'm 21 and from the Denver Metro area, so take that for what you will."
"Nice to see the artists way get a mention! I always think it may be looked on as too flowery in the midst of such scientific and rigid writing in this area.  Always been a standby for me,  been wanting to reread lately. 

Thanks for the recommends and the great write up!"
"Yea ok that *might* justify Viet Nam, but what about Cambodia?  The American invasion of South-East Asia was a war crime."
"Count: I **** the candles on the shelf

Me: hmm, what rhymes with shelf?

Count: and when I’m alone I **** mysellllllllf

Me: there it is"
Seems like I will be going with Linux mint based on what you said.
"Honestly it took a really long time for me to get into it. Like, ""why the hell am I still bothering to watch this"" long. But BAM it finally clicked and I was in love and then... Very depressed. It gets too real, man."
Thank you so much for this!
"[Wormwood](https://www.netflix.com/title/80059446)

From the director of The Thin Blue Line. This doc series blends real life interviews with incredibly trippy and extremely well acted/directed reenactments. A frustrating mystery that I still think about all the time, and I never see it discussed or even brought up; one of Netflix's best hidden gems."
They are stars but all have good acting performances as well
"A new album is expected this year, probably around April."
"There are shittons of videos on YouTube of parents showing star wars with that twist to their children the first time. The kids are absolutely flabbergasted. Check it out, real fun."
In another comment you said dental student... kind of a big difference. Plus I have always heard from dentists that you should stay away from abrasive toothpaste because it hurts enamel in the long run. Any thoughts?
"According to a Bloomberg article, Triclosan has been linked to cancer and has been banned in the EU from food.  Glaxo and P&G have removed it from their toothpastes.  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-11/in-35-pages-buried-at-fda-worries-over-colgate-s-total  FDA and Mayo clinic indicate there are real health concerns about Triclosan, though it does not at this time recommend avoiding it (apparently Triclosan is in lots of products).   http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm205999.htm  http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/triclosan/faq-20057861  For more info, try searching on ""triclosan fda"""
"Honestly, it could just be because I live in an older home that isn’t very bright in each room. I think? It could also just be that I see it that way. Lol. Everyone loves that color, though."
