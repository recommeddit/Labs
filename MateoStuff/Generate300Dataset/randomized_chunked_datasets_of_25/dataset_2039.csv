I highly recommend doing some Google-Fu and reasearching bottled water brands, and what's actually in them.

As for cleaning up your tap, I recommend a PUR water filter that you can attach to your faucet.

I did my Master's online through GATech, which was fine but really nothing more than video-taped classroom lectures, so I couldn't fully recommend it.

24007,"Here are some of my top choices; though they vary in genre, all are definite must-watches:

* [Tsuritama](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/Tsuritama) - Whimsical, bright, heartwarming with a touch of poignancy. It's the kind of show you want on a relaxed summer day (or a cold fall/winter day in which you long for summer). It's stunningly beautiful and a completely satisfying experience from beginning to end. When I'm down, it's my go-to pick-me-up. 

* [Welcome to the NHK](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso!) - It's seriously a life changing kind of anime. You will bust a gut laughing, all while perhaps crying at the same time. It is a positively brilliant anime that manages to hit at some dark and deeply rooted aspects of the human condition, and takes you through an emotional, tumultuous, hilarious, unexpected journey that really hits home, but also leaves you thoroughly entertained. The English dub is also a pretty great dub; either sub or dub are great experiences.

* [Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!) - Baccano! is a brilliant action-packed anime that has some of the most complex, but rewarding, storytelling I've seen. It's a very 'smart' anime that will definitely need to be paid attention to as the different pieces start intertwining and coming together, but man is it ridiculously satisfying. The plot is fantastic and told in an interesting way, and the wide cast of lovable albeit crazy (some borderline insane) characters really makes the show. It's a wild ride. Plus, the English dub is one of the better ones out there, so if you're one to debate between the two, both are great experiences. If anything, the English dub almost adds the extra flair to the 1930s New York underground kind of setting.

* [Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!) - Okay, so it's another anime by the same guy who wrote Baccano! -- but it, too, is a brilliantly told story. It's got the same marks of a wide cast of crazy characters, an interesting bridge of genre, great animation and music and absolutely masterful storytelling. I will say Durarara!! can seem to start off a bit slow, as pieces seem disjointed, but when you stick through it and once the pieces start coming together, it brings everything together fantastically. Another great dub. Both sub/dub are great experiences--and there's a second season to look forward to pretty soon!

* [Daily Lives of High School Boys](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou) - I'm a lover of comedy. So a lot of my suggestions are comedy-related. And this particular anime is something everyone must, must, must see. There's really not much of a plot. The anime is told in minute-long vignettes of sorts that really just set up and execute jokes. It's hilarious, ridiculously dry humor that is sure to make you laugh (maybe even out of shared experience, eh?). You just have to [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCa0eh-I1iQ) to believe, I suppose. Here are some more [sticks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL0zWuQXh1E) and [frankfurters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ck-k4XSqOI) if you're not convinced yet.

* [Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun](http://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun) or [The Devil is a Part-Timer](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15809/Hataraku_Maou-sama!)- Speaking of comedy, I'm just having a hard time being really decisive right now, so I'm putting in two that are just must-watch comedies. Gekkan Shoujo is a recently aired summer anime that just finished -- it's just ridiculously hilarious. If you're looking at it going ""That looks like another shouj--"" NO. It's bust-a-gut laughing. As for The Devil is a Part-timer, it tends to read more like a sitcom - great play on fantasy-meets-real-world cliche, and such dry, situational humor.

I realized I put in a lot of comedy-type suggestions in there. But I suppose it will balance out the other great suggestions in this thread. My top anime tend to shift a lot depending on my mood, though I will say that Tsuritama, Welcome to the NHK, Daily Lives, and Drrr!! always tend to be definites up there; the other slots are still great, but interchangeable.",best anime

40935,"I'll echo what the other poster said. You're at the point where you're trying to learn how certain patterns work: which chords go together, which sets of notes sound good together, how to reproduce a certain sound in your head on the guitar fretboard. Those patterns have to do with the actual notes – C#, Ab, G, etc. – not fret numbers. The fret numbers do of course correspond to those notes, but in standard tuning, that correspondence can be irregular, and you're not going to easily grasp it just by looking at tabs.

To give you an idea of what the next steps might look like for you – you have a chord progression, say E - C#m - Amaj7 - Bsus4 - B. You need to figure out a melody to play while the other instruments are playing that chord progression. Maybe it's a solo, maybe you're just trying to repeat a vocal melody, maybe you're coming up with a riff. If you're just thinking about fret numbers, it's a guessing game. But if you're thinking in terms of notes instead of fret numbers, it's easier. You'll recognize that these chords all use notes from the E major scale (E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D#); in other words, you're in the key of E. You'll know where the E note is in various places on your fretboard (for example, 3rd string, 9th fret or 5th string, 7th fret). From there, you'll learn the intervals between different notes (i.e. distance in pitch), so instead of thinking of every note individually, you'll be thinking more in terms of a starting anchor point and other notes in relation to this anchor. You'll see what notes are in each chord (for example, Amaj7 is A-C#-E-G#) and think of those in the context of the key.

Needless to say, tabs don't really help you make sense of this stuff. I'll use them for beginning students (especially younger ones) because learning the physical aspects of the guitar is hard enough. But I try to steer away from them as soon as possible.",best instrument to play

I was convinced to get an electric when they offered to sell me a top of line Sonicare ""at their bulk discount cost"".

To be honest they don't worry about type of toothpaste too much.

Any toothpaste with flouride if you are cavity prone.

Sensodyne if you don't have cavities yet have Sensitive areas.

The brush itself and flossing is more important. Always use a soft bristle brush. Your layer of enamel will not grow back if you wear it down. Brush at least twice a day. 

In the morning, eat and drink before you brush. Why brush if you just coat your teeth with food again? If you drink anything acidic rinse with water to get it off your teeth.

Floss before you go to bed. Always. No exceptions.

Chew gum with xylitol throughout the day after you eat. 

Invest in a sonicaire if you can. The difference is mind blowing and you'll never go back to a regular toothbrush.

Beware soda and other high sugar drinks. If you must partake drink it fast and rinse then chew gum

Be careful of whitening agents. They open ""pores"" on your teeth. If you are partaking too much in staining agents it will have the opposite effect.

Tldr - Doesn't matter too much if you're still brushing and flossing.",best toothpaste
