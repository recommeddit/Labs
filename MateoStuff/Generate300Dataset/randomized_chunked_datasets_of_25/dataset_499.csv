11244,best gifts for dad,"Better yet, plant two saplings and watch as the anticipation to use the hammock grows."
38245,best newspapers to read,"You are kinda out of luck if you are looking for a single good source. You need to piece together articles on specific topics to see the truth and examine the bias. Some have mentioned the Economist, but it is important to know they embody the very definition of liberal, meaning open up everything to everyone to make their own choices, essentially a more pragmatic libertarianism than we see in the States. If you are looking for straight facts and no analyses you can look at the Associated Press, very good for factual details but can be a little shallow on understanding and context. I like to use Feedly to pull articles from various sources and read articles on the same topic to get a better understanding of the subject. It aggregates everything together pretty nicely for comparative reading."
9771,best dorm hall at UCSB,"FT is further from campus but if you get a bike then that's completely fine. You share a bathroom with one other dorm which is a huge+, especially if you get chill people who you share the bathroom with too. In biased because I lived in FT my freshman year, but FT is the best dorm.

Also, FT = Santa Catalina"

Modern mainstream music isnt going to cut it for me working out, or otherwise!"
62466,Best RPG game on PS4,"I got it on sale last year, and was about 80% sure I would hate it and quit playing. Turn based combat has never really been my thing and I generally don't go for japanese-style games. I was wrong. I don't even know why I loved that game, but I'm so glad i gave it a shot."
37387,best amusement park,"I've been several times. It's good. The houses are not the scariest I've done, but they are fun and they pay a decent amount if attention to detail. And the scare zones are all good. They put a lot of effort in to the scare actors, costumes and makeup, and the whole in the woods thing adds a lot of atmosphere to the whole thing. They also used to do an excellent end of night show at the theater near France. Not sure if they did it last year or will do it this year, but it was always good.

However, Kings Dominion at least used to be better. Their scare zones were just better and really tried to scare people. Their houses/trails weren't any better than BGW's, really, but the scare zones put them over the top and they really took advantage of the more open spaces for them."
15016,best romantic novel,"For historicals no one beats Mary Balogh!

I also really like Karen Marie Moning and then if you want it super steamy and paranormal Emma Holly is your girl. 

Kresley Cole‚Äôs Professional series is excellent contemporary bdsm romance."
