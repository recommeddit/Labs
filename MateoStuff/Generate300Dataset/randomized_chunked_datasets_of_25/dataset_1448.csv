5673,"Can you actually land remote jobs knowing only HTML/CSS/minimal JavaScript? Or are you talking about non-""digital nomad"" jobs? When I look at Elance and related freelance sites, most of the employers are wanting a lot more than HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge...unless it's a $10 gig. 

I'm trying to figure out how to translate what I've learned in beginner HTML/CSS/JavaScript books into ways of expanding my minimal knowledge while earning an income, but, again, most require a lot more than minimal knowledge. 

What I'm trying to say is it seems like you have to invest a lot of time in a lot of different skills (other than HTML/CSS/JavaScript) before you're hirable for even freelance gigs. Or am I wrong?",best programming language for web development

55241,"Yeah, I did a week-long section of the AT this summer (actually the SNP section that the OP passed on), and the logistics were an enormous pain in the ass.  We were flying out so two-car shuttling wouldn't work: the solution involved planes, cars, buses, trains, and subways.  It was easier to just hike the whole damn trail.",best places to hike in the east coast

9237,"The biggest mistake people make--that's understandable and almost universal--is rinsing out toothpaste after brushing.  

Most toothpastes are made with ""strengthening"" chemicals that help your teeth, and you shouldn't rinse out your mouth after brushing.  Just spit until there's no more toothpaste in your spit, and let the remaining paste coat your teefers until it naturally washes away.  It's a small amount, it won't hurt your tummy.",best toothpaste

My mom stopped doing it when we were in high school, but my dad still has all of the shirts we ever gave him. He still wears them sometimes, too. It's kind of funny, since my sister and I are both now in our 20s, but to be honest, I find it very touching that he's kept them all these years. I love my dad.",best gifts for dad

If you look at his entire body of work, all the games he's played (except the ones he lost) and all the passes he threw (except the incompletions and interceptions), then you can clearly see Tebow has never lost a game and has 100% accuracy. He rejuvenated a franchise that has never won a Super Bowl from 2010 to 2011 and brought them to the playoffs where they beat the defending Super Bowl champions (had they beat Green Bay last year.) Greatest of all time.",best NFL player
30888,"I moved from Canada to the UK years ago and will probably never go back. Life here can be hard sometimes but I think it's worth it. I love the fact that I can get on a train and in 20 min be somewhere with a different accent. I love the pub culture. I love the museums/art galleries. And I love the sense of humor! It's also amazing that you can fly allover Europe for cheap. When I was in Canada a trip to Greece was considered a once in a lifetime experience... now I can go there without a second thought for the cost of a weeks wage! 

The weather is not as bad as some people make it out to be. Yes it rains. And sometimes, when it starts, it won't stop for days! But the beautiful frosty December mornings and long summer evenings make up for it! And remember, all that rain makes for some lush, green countryside.

But there are some right shit-hole towns.",best country to live in
