"Would you care take a closer look at [alkaline water pitchers](https://diligentchef.com/best-alkaline-water-pitcher/)? These devices produce kangen (alkaline) water which is much more healthier. 

I'm offering you some friendly advice to read this information about benefits of alkaline water: http://www.precisionnutrition.com/alkaline-water-legit-or-hoax"

"I  picked up the e-book of *Synners* as a blind buy a few days ago, because it was only two bucks. Based on the rest of your list, I'll probably enjoy it."
I work at Ben and Jerry's and we have a flavor called chocolate therapy that is unbelievable. When the shop isn't crowded I eat it out of the cases we keep the ice cream in.
"Piano. However, if you are inclined towards wind instruments (not that it sounds like it from your post), learn the clarinet. In my experience, people who learn that one first have much less trouble learning, say, the saxophone than the other way round."
"Great choice! I hope you don't get spoiled, not too many other languages have that combination of readability, efficiency and productivity. It does not get more pleasant than making simplicity as the abstraction. This is coming from a longtime Haskeller.

Todd Mcleod videos/courses on udemy and youtube for sure. When it comes to web development, Udemy has a few solid ones for Go.

There's also The Go Programming Language book which is the standard. It's a terrific book although it doesn't necessarily focus on web development. The Go Programming Language Phrasebook is another gem and I do not go to work without it.

I'll update if I can think of more."
My mom took a handful of Halloween candy from her work bowl to bring home to me and she said there were kit kats in the bag especially for me. She grabbed reeses instead on accident. They both have a red-orange wrapper so I understand the mistake but I was so disappointed. You don't just promise someone kit kats and then fall through!!

"My brother died at a young age, 25. While inconclusive we think it was a seizure due to epilepsy, long story but he had it as a child.

My cousin gave my parents a gift one year. A donation to the Epilepsy Foundation in my brothers name. The were very, very touched by the sentiment.

Maybe think something along those lines."
"Omg I love that game! I always play as my 2 favourite a (Riolu and Shinx). But man, trying to get a specific starter sucks. 

I actually brought that game home from my parents over the holidays because I wanted to play it and it's fairly hard to find nowadays."
"> For surgical disinfection, you need to scrub in with a disinfectant soap (preferably with chlorhexidine) for 30-60 seconds.

That used to be the standard, but alternatives involving alcohol-based sanitizers have become part of commonly recommended practice, and are well-supported by studies.

Soap & water is still needed to deal with visible dirt, though, so recommended practices involving sanitizers include at least a soap scrub before the first procedure of the day, and may also involve both a soap scrub and sanitizer use before every procedure.

According to [Recommended practices for surgical hand: antisepsis/hand scrubs](http://www.medline.com/sterilliumrub/documents/AORN%20Recommended%20practices%20for%20surgical%20hand.pdf) (PDF):

> ""Degerming with an alcohol-based hand rub is more effective than washing with soap and water and requires much shorter exposure time.
Data indicate that the use of an alcohol-based agent may increase overall compliance with hand hygiene. (30-32)

> [...]

> ""Alcohol-based solutions reduce bacterial counts on hands more rapidly than do antimicrobial soaps or detergents in the majority of experimental in vivo and in vitro models. (3) Alcohol hand-hygiene products alone kill more organisms than any product on the market but offer no appreciable persistence or cumulative effect. Use of a combination of active ingredients (eg, alcohol and chlorhexidine gluconate) to achieve both rapid reduction of microbial counts and the persistence and cumulative effect needed to prevent microbial regrowth is desirable. Randomized trials demonstrate better compliance with a surgical hand antisepsis protocol using an alcohol-based hand rub agent than with the traditional surgical scrub protocol. (56-59)

The above quotes include seven references, given in the PDF.

So, waddaya say now, soap guy? ;D

(P.S. Anyone operating on me should use both, thank you very much!)"
