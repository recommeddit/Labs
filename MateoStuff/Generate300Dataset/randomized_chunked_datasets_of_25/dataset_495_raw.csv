"This is what I do - but then my mom is Captain Awesome incarnate and I try to put a bit of special effort in - (Me and my brothers, 6 of us, organize this together)

1. Breakfast in bed.
2. No responsibilities that day. Everybody handles their own shit. If they can't, come to me.
3. Big bag of stuff she likes. Viennese truffles, fresh flowers for her room (she really likes flowers), big ass bottle of malibu. Etc.
4. Favorite take away for dinner. 
5. We all get her something for her garden too. And we all pitch in for a few hours."
"There are an _enormous_ number of academic CS papers. They're all archived on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), but that's like saying ""how do I find good websites?"" ""Use Google."" You really need a more specific query than that.

If you find a sub-field that's particularly interesting to you, then you can look for conferences related to that field. The [Association for Computer Machinery (ACM)](https://dl.acm.org/conferences) hosts many, but far from all, computer science conferences. If you find a conference that's interesting to you, like Computer Supported Collaborative Work (ACM-CSCW) or Hypertext (ACM-HT), then that gives you a much more specific starting point, and you can look at publications from that conference to get a starting idea of what's going on in the field, then use the topics and keywords you've gained to search Google Scholar and find related papers from other conferences and journals."

"I would happily do snakes but my SO isn't really a fan. I had a ball python when I was younger that I had for close to 10yrs. I also had a burmese python who I had for about 7yrs (and about 6ft long) when  I had to get rid of her. I loved my burmese. She was pretty mellow and would always just hang out on me. I had to move to a small apartment and now longer had the space for her so I wound up giving her to a friend that was able to build a large custom enclosure for her. Growing up we also had garter snakes and a bullsnake. We always bought frozen or pre-killed feeders. 

I've had iguanas but I'm not a fan of the smell and no matter how much attention they got, ours were fairly aggressive (not sure why). 

I've always really wanted a Chameleon but I haven't spent much time looking into the upkeep for them.

Maybe we'll look into rats. I've had other friends suggest them as well and say they're fairly good companion pets."

"There's a lot about Lincoln that most people don't remember.

For example, rather than being a big popular hero in the north during the war, Lincoln was actually quite unpopular, and looked virtually certain to lose reelection to a lot of people.

Lincoln was also quite frankly a loser at life. He lost more elections then he won. His only experience in Federal office before being president was serving a single term in the house, before he was voted out of office."
"Seconding this rec for maui jims. Their lenses are awesome, with amazing clarity. I don't think I can go back to regular lenses after using polarized lenses for driving , etc. They are pricey, but it's worth every penny! I haven't worn any of my other sunglasses since. 

I also had a fantastic experience with their warranty, which is 2 years according to their policy. After owning my pair of maverick (aviator style) for bout 1.5 years, I noticed the coating on the inside of the lens coming off. This is the part that rubs against my cheek...And I have oily skin...so who knows. Anyway, I call their warranty and repair centre and they said no problem, just send it in. No proof of purchase, no receipts required. I had to pay shipping, which was fine. 

(Btw, for Canadians, their repair centre is located in Mississauga!)

About 2 weeks later, a new pair of the exact sunglasses showed up at my door! Their note said they didn't have the parts on hand to repair my defective pair, so they just sent me a new pair. :D Minor issue of having to go back to my optician to adjust the glasses to my face..but I still got a new pair in the end. My optician said companies like Ray ban wouldn't cover coating issues, let alone have a 2 year warranty. 

I've noticed their styles are getting more with the times - more stylish, more female targeted choices. Their older pairs are sportier than my preference. I have my eye on a pair of keanae and that's my next pair of mj's."
"Meet quite a few working at Disney.  Some of the notable ones for their personalities:  


Drew Carey: nicest freaking celebrity at Disney.  Dude doesn't even act like one.  Just goes around like parks like a regular tourist.  Waits in lines, no special treatment, etc.  So many people have waited in line with him and left thinking they were talking with that guy who looks so much like Drew Carey, not realizing it was him.  (Just to be safe he still has a hostess that goes around with him, let's us know he is coming, etc, but stays out of the way)

Bill Nye: kinda of a dick.  Spent the whole time just talking about all the things he was in at Disney.  

Christie Brinkley: super nice."
"I like Midsomer Murders.  
At least until John Nettles left.  
  
Also as someone else has said, Poirot, preferably David Suchet, or Miss Marple adaptations."
Completely agree with your assessment.
"I’ve had an iphone 5, 6, 8 plus, and currently have an 11. 8 plus was my fav, only reason I upgraded to an 11 was so that I could use my 8 as my work phone. Otherwise, I would have used that phone till its last leg."
"Interesting, I'll have to try that one. Thanks!"

That's a really good point. Denmark is currently a better side than Serbia and I'd even argue Croatia.

If someone is buying a used iPhone 5, which model will they get?


If you go for the iPhone 5C, you don't have to worry about the lock button, battery, or frequency support."

"If you have a PC, I'd say PS4 for the exclusives alone. Definitely worth it, though be warned: PS5 is only confirmed to have PS4 backwards compatibility, whereas the Xbox Series X seems to be having full backwards compatibility from all generations."
