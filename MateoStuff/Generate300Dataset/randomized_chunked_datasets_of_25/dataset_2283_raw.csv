"Upvote for Ringworld (and several of the sequels).  I sometimes ask people if they've read ""The Luck of Teela Brown,"" to see of they have any idea what I'm talking about.  Some do, others do only do after I say, ""or Ringworld, as it's called here."""
"RIP all of my guesses. I mean, town council is kind of managing. It's managing a place! Haha"

Because Redditors don't tend to know anything about football history from pre-2013 and YouTube highlights
"I got overwhelmed with the sheer number of games when I first really dove into the hobby. Luckily I am now in a place where I have nearly ever single game I would ever want to own. Do I still want 3 more games? Yes. But I can now patiently wait for the reprints, because I have a completely sweet collection now. If anything, I need to thin out my collection."

Just don't go there now and keep working on your box. Some artists on there make me feel like my attempts at creativity are trash. Hope your box turned out awesome!"
Even if you didn't have there is a risk for a heart infection and you really should not give this advice
"Honestly probably love bag lady just as much, the song is so smooth."

"You should check out B. Cool-Aid if you haven’t yet, it’s a duo of Pink Siifu over production by Ahwlee. Their ep Syrup is a really smooth listen.

Yeah it's just PD. The pixel needs it. Never had any issues with two pixels and PD. Can't speak to the others unfortunately!
Slightly misleading. You play through one ending. Chapter select the 2nd ending. And the 3rd is unlocked from doing the other 2. So one full playthrough and one 10min chapter select for 3 mandatory ending. Much easier than 3 playthrough.
Put?  More like forcibly apply.
