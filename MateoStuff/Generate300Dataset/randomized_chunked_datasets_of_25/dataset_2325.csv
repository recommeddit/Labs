7470,"Hi, I'm looking for a new laptop. I have a Dell Inspirion 13 3960 = got it about 5 years ago as a gift, but currently, I'm having major issues with it: fan was working overtime (fixed with an application), however now it says I have no AC adapter, and will no longer charge. I'm typing on my laptop currently with a 0% charge.

I'm in college for Informatics (like IT easiest way to explain) and we use VM sometimes. What would be the best laptop in theory for me? I want a decent processor to run the VM terminal assignments - though I want battery life to be my focus, most important I just don't want it to be heavy. Also, definitely not in the 1,000 price range! I hope I'm not asking for too much lol

\*\*\*Edit actually I do have some saved scholarship money - so if it's a more expensive one, but will help me even after I finish these last two years, I'll take it!",best laptop for general use

I'd say it even affects the local GP cause Knott's has really been killing it with the food festivals and seasonal events that even rival Disneyland's.
