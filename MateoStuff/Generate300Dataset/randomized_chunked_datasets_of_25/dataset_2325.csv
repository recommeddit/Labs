It's a very easy 10 mile loop, most of which is on flat ground."
7470,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I'm looking for a new laptop. I have a Dell Inspirion 13 3960 = got it about 5 years ago as a gift, but currently, I'm having major issues with it: fan was working overtime (fixed with an application), however now it says I have no AC adapter, and will no longer charge. I'm typing on my laptop currently with a 0% charge.

I'm in college for Informatics (like IT easiest way to explain) and we use VM sometimes. What would be the best laptop in theory for me? I want a decent processor to run the VM terminal assignments - though I want battery life to be my focus, most important I just don't want it to be heavy. Also, definitely not in the 1,000 price range! I hope I'm not asking for too much lol

\*\*\*Edit actually I do have some saved scholarship money - so if it's a more expensive one, but will help me even after I finish these last two years, I'll take it!"

37219,best amusement park,That's definitely a factor for families on vacation. I'd say it even affects the local GP cause Knott's has really been killing it with the food festivals and seasonal events that even rival Disneyland's. Scary Farm within the last 5 years alone has been drawing in TONS of locals (remember one maze getting a 3-4 hour wait last year) and its only getting better.
7168,best iPhone,"You want the latest chips, so se2 is probably the best bet.   If you want to keep it for 5 years the older models will get a lot more sluggish.  
11 maybe best if you like the bigger form factor, otherwise se2 is mostly a 11 in a smaller form factor."
