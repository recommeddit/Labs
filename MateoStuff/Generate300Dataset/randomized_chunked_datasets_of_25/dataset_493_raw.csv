"Happy 21st! These were my favorite drinks when I was new to the world of drinking:

\- malibu and pineapple juice

\-vodka and pineapple juice

\-amaretto/whiskey sours

\-Tokyo Teas if I was trying to get drunk quick/cheaply (similar to long island teas)

Once I got more accustomed to the taste of alcohol I'd go with:

\-whiskey ginger

\-moscow mules

\-gin and tonics"
"Yeah... someday vendors will understand.  

Yeah no probably not.

I guess sometimes you just have to dot your i's and cross your t's."
"Compromise your values or just compromise? I doubt people would be upset if more politicians ""compromise their values"" and came together on issues to govern rather than draw lines in the sand and squawk about who's the most ideologically pure."
"Dentist in Los Angeles here. I have Crest Tartar Control. This is because my wife will never change her brand of toothpaste. And as we all know it's just easier to agree with your wife. I could care less as long at it has Fluoride and does not advertise itself at a ""Whitening"" toothpaste."
"I like how the country with legalised abortion, euthanasia, same-sex marriage, soft-drug use and prostitution is ranked not only below 8 countries that barely have half of those, but actually below *Ireland* in Personal Freedom.

"Becoming a neurosurgeon would probably be the worst way to FIRE... 4 years undergrad, 4 years medical, 3 years neuro residency, 3 years surgical residency, 3 years neruosurgical residency... if starting at 18, and never you never meander, you dont earn your 800k/year until your 35, and by that time, your student loans (which you have been making small payments on during a million years of residency) have probably balooned to 500k.

Fuck neurosurgery"

">Maybe then I can finally get my Trinitron off my desk too.

Considering that's probably 400:1 or 500:1 ANSI, I'm surprised you haven't gotten ridden of that yet. There's no IPS glow, I suppose, but a G7 would still crush it for picture quality."
How very American.
"For a new mom, having someone just pay attention to you and take care of your needs, for even an hour would be amazing."
Dropped Axios for fetch over a year ago. Never looked back.
"asking today, in 2018, i would save javascript. just because you can learn and work on mastery of one language that can \(perhaps not should\) be used on both front and back end. furthermore, no matter what back end language you use you're going to end up writing some javascript.

this is from someone who doesn't really like javascript."
"It sounds weird but get the Charmin Ultra Soft toilet paper. I always use that instead of tissues when at home, itâ€™s much better imo."
Thatâ€™s the joke
"A close friend of my mom has a daughter with two masters degrees, Art History and Art Education. The best she could find in art was giving kids tours one day per week. It was unfortunate :/"
