"It depends on what you want to do, If you just want to get use your computer as a desktop/laptop then I would recommend ubuntu for the ease of use and the improving stability.

"Everything I ever hear about him he’s super cool.  He [did a rap](https://reddit.app.link/6bYQSntiy5)  from Moana with some dude interviewing him for the guys kids because the guys kids were massive Moana fans.

I reckon he’s so nice that on the aeroplane, I bet you he let the person next to him have the armrest.  He probably thought this isn’t the Rock’s elbow room, this is the people’s elbow room."
