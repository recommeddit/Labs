Any of the main line Dirt series if you want a racing game with a more arcade feel. Dirt Rally if you want to be challenged. World Rally Championship or WRC are also fun. A nice balance of realism and arcade-like controls. F1 series is great and honestly I was shocked how much I liked Need for Speed Heat.
I've always considered amusement parks a broader category that also includes theme parks.
"Hello, 

I'm slightly overwhelmed with the choices and different recommendations from friends, so I'm wondering if you can help me. 

- My budget is £500-£600 (So the $600-$799 range).
- SSD for sure
- 8GB ram ideally
- Decent battery life, maybe 4 hours (my current one is 0 so anything is a step up)
- For general use, streaming netflix, photoshop, also potentially video editing (would you recommend a higher budget for something like this?)

Thanks ever so much for any advice."

I'm loyal to T-Mobile after I had to go to different countries and didn't have to spend on communication because my plan gave me free talk/text/data.

"Not sure what counts as an RPG, but I highly recommend the Uncharted series. Fantastic gameplay, fantastic storytelling. Tomb Raider is another series similar to Uncharted.

And The Last of Us 1 and 2 are the best games I've ever played."

"NFL network has a Top 100 players series. If I remember correctly, it was Jerry Rice, Jim Brown, Lawrence Taylor, Joe Montana and ~~Dick Butkus~~ Walter Payton.

Can't disagree really."

My husband absolutely loves Bombshell in Bloom from Victoria Secret on me. I can't find it anywhere and the bottle he gifted my was stolen with my purse after my car was broken into during a 12 hour shift. I'd give anything to see the smile he would get when he'd smell it on me.
"General Studies.


Just pick a major. Being undecided all 4 years won't look great on your first resume unless you leave undergrad with some amazing experience that translates into an immediate position."
"On AliExpress you can find a brand called ""Elitas"" that have aluminum framed sunglasses with polarized lenses for like $8 in a variety of styles. I have 3 pairs of them that I ordered 2 years ago and they've held up fine. The downside is it takes around a month to get them delivered. I think Amazon might carry them but they're $15-20 each"

"I thought the same thing, that activated carbon does indeed bind organic compounds. The source of the confusion may be that his measurements do not measure the types of organic compounds that are absorbed. It is possible to miss large swaths of different types of organic compounds, depending on how your mass spec is set up."
"I use Irish Spring and TRESemmé shampoo and conditioner, and my girlfriend loves it. Really, really basic. Nothing special at all."
This is such a good idea

This was meant to be a humorous reference to Steve Jobs‘ (in)famous line. Perhaps not *that* funny.
