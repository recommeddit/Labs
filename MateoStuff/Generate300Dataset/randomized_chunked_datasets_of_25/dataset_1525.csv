22326,best celebrity,"I met Vin Diesel at a truck stop diner when I was a kid.  


It was like 4 in the morning and me, my grandpa and vin and his friend were the only ones in the diner, and we ended up getting sat at the table next to them. 

Vin and a friend were getting ready to go on some fishing trip which was made obvious by the clothes they were wearing. My grandpa struck up a conversation about fishing with him, completely oblivious to who he was. He was a really nice guy and apparently knew a great deal about fishing techniques. 


I was a bit geeked out and didn‚Äôt say much or contribute to the conversation but I spent the next hour of our road trip explaining to my grandpa who vin diesel was and why it was a huge deal we just met him."

She wanted a rust/penny color for her door, it ended up nacho cheese orange because the name had copper in it. She wanted a warm apricot color for the bathroom it's this hideous dingy orange carrot color, what's worse is she painted it over this really dark artichoke color green with no primer so the orange was really heavy and muddy looking. Her kitchen is this waaay over saturated smurf blue and the room connected to it is an intense cheeto orange. It's like living in a disgusting vomit of colors."
