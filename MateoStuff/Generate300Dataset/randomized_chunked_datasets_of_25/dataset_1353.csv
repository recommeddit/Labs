38554,"The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star every day. The former is an excellent all-around national paper, and the latter is somewhere between lousy and mediocre as far as the writing and reporting go, but is very good for general information about local news and happenings.

One of the several advantages of a physical paper is that as you leaf from page to page, you often stumble across random oddball things (including ads about local sales, events, exhibitions, etc.) that you didn't previously know existed and that you might be interested in, and I find the Internet inferior for this type of thing.

On the other hand, I realise that most Americans don't have ready access to a high-quality paper (my few run-ins with USA Today left me with a bad taste in my mouth), so you might not know what you're missing.

And finally, I often enjoy reading the paper while sitting on a rock in the middle of a river during the warmer months, and I'm certainly not taking my laptop out there.",best newspapers to read

9151,"I've suffered from horrible canker sores my whole life. I've also suffered from IBS as well. It was about 5 years ago I was prescribed a medication to treat the IBS, something called hyoscyamine. I take it twice a day every day. I now only get a canker sore if I miss taking the medication for a week or so.  I've actually gone a couple of years without getting one but then I get lazy about refiling the medication and one will start to form. This shit is a miracle drug and I've always wanted to tell people about it because canker sores are the worst.",best toothpaste

For inking, I use fineliners - my brand is Uni Pin, but Sakura, Copic, Derwent Graphik, and Staedtler are others I've seen. I use my 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 the most.",best pencil for drawing

67026,">  80% of your response is pure attempt at dick measuring and argument via authority.  

There was nothing till YOU started trying to measure dicks. Look in the mirror before you accuse me.  
  
>  My question about the boogie was clearly rhetorical.   

No, you were trying to make yourself seem like an expert. I answered your silly question, you can't defend against it and so you changed your argument. You said: "" I've been to many boogies.....Have you ever been to a Boogie?""

>  because you're not listening.   

Irony score off the chart here. I said boogies are not good paces to go to get or stay current: ""Boogies are not great places to go to stay current or get current."" You took umbrage with that and argued some other point. 

>  Now you're latching into my rhetorical question about going to boogies because your ego is fragile or something. Relax. You're a skygod. We all get it. You're a big deal. That doesn't mean you're right, automatically, though. A boogie isn't as bad as you're pretending it is, and your reasonings are invalid.  

And now you devolve into personal attacks.... Till you answer the questions... You are not worth trying to have a discussion.. All you have brought so far is your failed attempt to paint me as a novice who has not been to a boogie, then some personal attacks.",best places to skydive in california
