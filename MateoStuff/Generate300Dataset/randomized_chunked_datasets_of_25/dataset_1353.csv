8435,best toothpaste,Isn't it disgusting to not rinse your mouth after brushing especially if theres still bits of food stuck?
73054,best Linux distro,Fedora releases get security patches for 12-18 months before you're forced to upgrade. Avoid.
38554,best newspapers to read,"The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star every day. The former is an excellent all-around national paper, and the latter is somewhere between lousy and mediocre as far as the writing and reporting go, but is very good for general information about local news and happenings.

One of the several advantages of a physical paper is that as you leaf from page to page, you often stumble across random oddball things (including ads about local sales, events, exhibitions, etc.) that you didn't previously know existed and that you might be interested in, and I find the Internet inferior for this type of thing.

On the other hand, I realise that most Americans don't have ready access to a high-quality paper (my few run-ins with USA Today left me with a bad taste in my mouth), so you might not know what you're missing.

And finally, I often enjoy reading the paper while sitting on a rock in the middle of a river during the warmer months, and I'm certainly not taking my laptop out there."

28356,best breakfast foods,I've never done baked oatmeal with eggs in it - my baked oatmeal is literally just oatmeal + ingredients baked in the oven to make it cake-like. I'm definitely going to try it with eggs!
66454,best soccer team in the world,"Mexico has been playing moleros? Idk, past few friendlies have been vs decent/good teams"
9151,best toothpaste,"I've suffered from horrible canker sores my whole life. I've also suffered from IBS as well. It was about 5 years ago I was prescribed a medication to treat the IBS, something called hyoscyamine. I take it twice a day every day. I now only get a canker sore if I miss taking the medication for a week or so.  I've actually gone a couple of years without getting one but then I get lazy about refiling the medication and one will start to form. This shit is a miracle drug and I've always wanted to tell people about it because canker sores are the worst."
29027,best calendar tool,"I use Business calendar app, I am pleased with the free version and I have it as a widget on my Android phone. It keeps me organized."
17951,best Kardashian,Kris is my número uno forever. I could just watch her drunk prank calling people for an entire season.
5122,best home improvement store,"Lowe's jebaited me out of a pair of flush cutters. I saw a red and white package that said Milwaukee on it, figured out was a good enough brand and paid. Turns out it was some shit tier no name Chinesium brand that had this on the packaging:

^Made ^in

#Milwaukee

^Wisconsin

Probably not Lowe's fault, but I've held a grudge ever since."
10183,best pencil for drawing,"For me, I find the best option is using 32lb/120gsm paper (it's thick enough that basic pen and ink doesn't show through) and a couple of decent quality pencils like Derwent Academy or pick up a mechanical pencil. I tend to keep in the 3H-3B range for leads.

For inking, I use fineliners - my brand is Uni Pin, but Sakura, Copic, Derwent Graphik, and Staedtler are others I've seen. I use my 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 the most."
70677,best movies with a cool twist,"You see not only multiple hats, but multiple Angiers. It’s the closing shot, even, I think — rows and rows of dead angiers in glass cages. 

That’s also why they hired the blind men to clean the place. 

Anyhow I think the cloning wasn’t a “maybe” type of thing.

The spinning top in inception being, of course, an entirely different matter.."
46088,best trick or treating candy,"It's like this jackass I was talking to at a party the other day. Literally spent fifteen minutes bitching that someone else had brought in a case of rolling rock to share, instead of whatever ridiculous (probably overpriced) hipster beer he pretends to like because he thinks it makes him seem sophisticated. I don't get it."
72722,best wireless lightweight mouse,Usual limited run nonsense.
8388,best toothpaste,"I got something similar when I had my eyes examined; the eye doctor wasn't actually allowed to recommend a specific store to buy glasses. I ended up pointing out I'd recently moved to a new country, had NO idea what their stores that sold glasses were even called, and I was now asking her as a private person where she bought HER glasses."

67026,best places to skydive in california,">  80% of your response is pure attempt at dick measuring and argument via authority.  

There was nothing till YOU started trying to measure dicks. Look in the mirror before you accuse me.  
  
>  My question about the boogie was clearly rhetorical.   

No, you were trying to make yourself seem like an expert. I answered your silly question, you can't defend against it and so you changed your argument. You said: "" I've been to many boogies.....Have you ever been to a Boogie?""

>  because you're not listening.   

Irony score off the chart here. I said boogies are not good paces to go to get or stay current: ""Boogies are not great places to go to stay current or get current."" You took umbrage with that and argued some other point. 

>  Now you're latching into my rhetorical question about going to boogies because your ego is fragile or something. Relax. You're a skygod. We all get it. You're a big deal. That doesn't mean you're right, automatically, though. A boogie isn't as bad as you're pretending it is, and your reasonings are invalid.  

And now you devolve into personal attacks.... Till you answer the questions... You are not worth trying to have a discussion.. All you have brought so far is your failed attempt to paint me as a novice who has not been to a boogie, then some personal attacks."
36813,best alcoholic drink,"I’m hardened at 23 and only really like vodka rocks (with lemon), whiskey rocks, or tequila rocks (with lime), but if I’m not caring about calories I love a good Mai Tai, Hurricane, or Whiskey Sour."
