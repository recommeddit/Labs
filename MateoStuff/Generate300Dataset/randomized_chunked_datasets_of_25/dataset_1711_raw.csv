"I second this.. This was amongst the earliest romance novels I read and inspite of a decade of reading hundreds of romances, this one stays my favorite."
"OH THAT'S RIGHT.

MY CHILDHOOD ALSO INVOLVED LOADS O' SENSODYNE.

this is like remembering a long lost brother. I haven't thought of that name for so long."
"I've always been really captivated by bonsai, I tried to grow one from a seed and killed it :/ one day I'd like to have many bonsai and actually be able to care for them properly"
"I believe the official genre for Rebecca is ""romantic suspense."" Read it about a week ago, seems pretty accurate."
Till i collapse by Eminem
do you own a gun?  kill everybody thar disagrees with you and if you are right you can have much sex with teenage girls
"How the psyche perceives the world is a science to be studied. It's called ""Psychology""."
"Clears or reds IMO, Browns have a really weak bump"
"It doesn't help anybody. It's, literally, a placebo."

Is that one abrasive? And if yes: Will it damage my teeth when I use it daily? (It says to use it three times a day… I brush twice)."
"disneyland will probably be the most memorable. it has a little something for everyone. try to go on a weekday (not friday lol) to avoid the crowds as much as possible.

knotts is also very fun, lots of roller coasters and good food. six flags has better coasters than knotts IMO, but it’s a fair drive.

avoid seaworld at all costs. an unethical and garbage corporation.

can’t say much about universal because i’ve never been, but it doesn’t get as much hype as disney."
"Ahhh, YouTube comments. You know you shouldn't read them, you know they're going to be fucking awful, and you know you should just skip them entirely... but then you still look anyways. Afterwards, you just facepalm yourself, wondering just how the hell these people function in real life. 

Seriously, why does YouTube have the absolute worst comments?"
Vet Ranch. Makes me happy seeing cute puppies and kittens get all fixed up and sent to a nice home.
"Anything by J. Daniels!!! I love the Sweet Addiction series and Dirty Deeds, simple premises but sooooo addicting and good!!"
The LG27GL850 is the nicest gaming monitor I've ever had. I think you should be able to find the 27GN850 a little cheaper. The ability of the pixels to refresh so fast makes it amazingly clear and the ips panel is pretty damn good.
"Updating now, thank you"
