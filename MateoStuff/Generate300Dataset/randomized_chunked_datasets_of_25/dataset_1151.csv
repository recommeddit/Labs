69878,"It's an echo of what is being preached at colleges and universities all over.  They only push Big 4, and as a result, a majority of the posts on the sub are from college kids trying to get a little bit of understanding about the Big 4.  There are, however, decent occasional posts where people talk about jobs outside the Big 4.",best major to study in college

Contacted Tauer, they said they are not gonna help me because I bought it from retailer lol. One of the shittiest bottle designs.

5914,"I'm not very well versed on the formal courses out there that tech JS concepts, but I did run across [this article](https://codeburst.io/best-courses-to-learn-javascript-in-2017-fc3a254638cc) which lists a bunch of free online JS courses you could choose from.

I think now especially, there is a heavy focus on Javascript frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular etc.), but if you're just starting out, I would recommend staying away from a framework. Learning the basics of the language itself is paramount. These frameworks just introduce extra niceities around data management, layout and ui components which are things you won't have to worry about unless you're building complex web applications.

As for a project suggestion, I would try to build a website that has a single input field and a button. When you click the button, try to get a website to display an alert message with the text inside the input field.",best programming language for web development

And shitty middle-aged white comedians usually rely on one joke as well, which usually amounts to basically ""I don't have sex as often since I've been married."" See: Everybody Loves Raymond, King of Queens, and basically any comedy featuring an attractive wife and a fumbling buffoon of a husband.",best celebrity
55502,"My latest discoveries in adventure fantasy are **The Copper Promise**, a rambunctious story featuring a group of mercenaries (the first book is episodic and stands alone. Complete series), **The Greatcoats**, starting with Traitor's Blade which is a swashbuckling series full of witty banter (ongoing series), and **Master of the Whitestorm**, a great sword&sorcery adventure with a psychological twist and a mysterious protagonist.

They are all adult fantasy titles full of action and travels, but there is also care on worldbuilding and character development.",best action and adventure novel series
