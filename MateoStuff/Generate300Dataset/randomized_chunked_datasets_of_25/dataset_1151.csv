69878,best major to study in college,"It's an echo of what is being preached at colleges and universities all over.  They only push Big 4, and as a result, a majority of the posts on the sub are from college kids trying to get a little bit of understanding about the Big 4.  There are, however, decent occasional posts where people talk about jobs outside the Big 4."
6130,best Netflix documentary,"Interesting, not surprised since everything is under a subscription nowadays. Thanks for the info."
58648,best cologne,"Yeah smell is great,one of my favorite dry downs ever. Be careful with the bottle!!! I got mine leaked and some people too. Contacted Tauer, they said they are not gonna help me because I bought it from retailer lol. One of the shittiest bottle designs. At this point I think I'm not going to buy something from Tauer unless they are going to change bottle design."

71372,best movies with a cool twist,"One of the best uses of Elephants in a key sound design moment out there, up there with Star Warsâ€™ TIE fighters."
1184,best ice cream flavor,Butter Pecan!
39017,best web browser,Hehe that sounds like me testing new browsers out :)
27334,best stocks to buy,"GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, COST, SBUX - These are all companies I rarely (if ever) have had a negative consumer experience with. Great products + Positive consumer experience = Long term growth and consistency.  They also all have diversified product lines (except for SBUX but coffee ain't going anywhere)."
9715,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I really like the traditional style of Anacapa, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, I think Santa Cruz is my first choice. Thanks for the tips!"
5914,best programming language for web development,"I'm not very well versed on the formal courses out there that tech JS concepts, but I did run across [this article](https://codeburst.io/best-courses-to-learn-javascript-in-2017-fc3a254638cc) which lists a bunch of free online JS courses you could choose from.

I think now especially, there is a heavy focus on Javascript frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular etc.), but if you're just starting out, I would recommend staying away from a framework. Learning the basics of the language itself is paramount. These frameworks just introduce extra niceities around data management, layout and ui components which are things you won't have to worry about unless you're building complex web applications.

As for a project suggestion, I would try to build a website that has a single input field and a button. When you click the button, try to get a website to display an alert message with the text inside the input field."
35016,best NFL player,They need to appease the baby Seahawk fan posting above complaining about lack of pre1960 representation.
47610,best state to visit in the United States,"Oh yeah, I forgot about the bridge and all the landslides. Rough season for that area."
22714,best celebrity,"He only has one joke: Mexican people and white people are different. Just thousands and thousands of variations on that theme. Lots of shitty black comedians fall into the same trap. And shitty middle-aged white comedians usually rely on one joke as well, which usually amounts to basically ""I don't have sex as often since I've been married."" See: Everybody Loves Raymond, King of Queens, and basically any comedy featuring an attractive wife and a fumbling buffoon of a husband."
55502,best action and adventure novel series,"My latest discoveries in adventure fantasy are **The Copper Promise**, a rambunctious story featuring a group of mercenaries (the first book is episodic and stands alone. Complete series), **The Greatcoats**, starting with Traitor's Blade which is a swashbuckling series full of witty banter (ongoing series), and **Master of the Whitestorm**, a great sword&sorcery adventure with a psychological twist and a mysterious protagonist.

They are all adult fantasy titles full of action and travels, but there is also care on worldbuilding and character development."
70071,best major to study in college,"I also did poli sci, and while the raw information is out there for free, the context provided by interacting with professors who are experts in the field, is not. 

Upvote for political science!"

The bridge/bron - not sure what its on though."

70669,best movies with a cool twist,Donnie Darko is the exact exemple of a movie I watched while expecting twists and it kinda ruined it for me. Still enjoyed it though but need a rewatch.
