"Haha, [the fallacy fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy)"
Probably because Pepperdine has more students from the UAE than the US.
Was he sitting at every table?
I'm in the same boat. The X is off the table for me as it was released in 2017. Based on the form factor of your current iPhone I would wait for the iPhone 13 to be released then buy an iPhone 12 mini secondhand. Try to buy as new a phone within your budget to maximize software support and security updates. I'm in the same $100 per year of use mindset. Current S8+ user.
My aunt and her daughter's father alternate custody on weekends but she gets her mother's day no matter what and he gets her father's day no matter what. Decency goes a long way.
"I think this is a legitimate fatFIRE topic and I was interested to read some of the other answers. I do believe one's view of the ""nicest hotel"" is set by how much time you've spent travelling high-end in Asia (ie be prepared to be forever disappointed on return to the US!)

For me, the Asian Amans really set the benchmark. I've stayed at Amanoi in Vietnam, Amankila and Amandari in Indonesia, and Amanbagh in Rajasthan, India. It's hard to summarise really how good they are, but the best summary I've heard is that it's much more like staying at a billionaire friend's house than a hotel.

The effort that Aman have gone to build and operate properties in incredibly, stunning remote places is quite amazing. Amanoi is a project that it is hard to imagine many other companies even attempting, much less executing in such style.

For city and destination hotels in India the Oberois are consistently good. Likewise elsewhere in Asia you can't really go too wrong with the Asian luxury brands ie Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula or Rosewood - but in most cities there's one or two standout properties that if you are really into hotels you'd want to check out, ie the Oriental in Bangkok, Upper House in HK, Park Hyatt in Tokyo.

PS There is a fatFIRE-ish [Luxury Hotels forum on Flyertalk](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/luxury-hotels-travel-220/) which gets into all of this in much more detail with great expertise in such things"
"My wife and I honeymooned in Costa Rica, and Hilton Papagayo in Guanacaste.  It was fantastic. This was about five weeks ago, in late May.

While the resort itself was not the newest or most polished place (a few things could have used a coat of paint, or general refreshing), it was a fantastic experience.  The staff were friendly, the food was good, the drinks were good, the activities were fun (but seriously consider doing nothing).

We decided before leaving that we were going back in a couple of years (probably 2016).

Edit: Added timeframe."

"Brita seems to be one of the most common when I search for filters. No one on here seems to have on (or mentioned it). Is Team Frugal against them? If so, why? I'm currently evaluating filters as well. Brita seems to come up as an option and replacement filters are sold everywhere."
That sounds pretty filling idk if smoothies can surpass that
"I can say you and I have almost exactly the same taste so I highly recommend you to check out Bojack Horseman, F is For Family, Master of None and Crazyhead if you haven't already. Also not so Netflix shows but Peep Show and The IT Crowd is a must watch if they are available in your country!"
I second this!

"I do, I like Purple(Grape) NOS, and regular Monster, which I am currently not drinking because of their poor decision to go after the Vermonster beer. Hopefully they will apologize soon and leave Vermonster alone, and I will then be able to drink my favorite non-grape energy drink."

"I’m a big fan of BM as well. I’d generally go Regal but I’ve chosen Aura for deeper/more vivid colors. I don’t see much of a difference in lighter/more neutral tones, personally. At least nothing that makes up the price difference…unless you need a higher hide and don’t want to prime (to which I’d say “suck it up buttercup”, 2-in-1 will always be a marketing gimmick and separate primers will always be superior)"

"In the Athletic's defence, I've really enjoyed the actual quality of writing about the various players on the list. You can have bar arguments about whether they got the list and the order right, but taken as 100 articles about great players I think it's been a success.

It's been interesting how they've chosen to write about each player: some focus on an individual game, or even a particular play; some talk about the player's influence on his teammates, or his influence on the sport as a whole; the more historical articles make an attempt to highlight how that player was so good compared to those around him at the time.

All-in-all, I've found it a really enjoyable project, and I've certainly learnt a lot about so many players. And it finishes literally the day before the season starts, so it won't interfere with actual analysis of the games/teams."
I personally like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
I'd say Sim is way more realistic. e.g. in P-Cars you can get into suspension and tire pressure settings for specific tracks/races/etc. Arcade is more just boot up and go.
Oh my god thanks for this post you reminded me my ice cream was sitting in my counter for 15 minutes.
Shiesty season  no doubt
"SFMM looks a lot better than SFGAdv, which looks very overrated.  I'm not serious, because that's a dumb thing to say.  El Toro looks ridiculous.  

1.) Magic Mountain - Roller coasters galore.  Twisted Colossus fits smack dab in the middle of my top 10 roller coasters.  Full Throttle, X2, and Tatsu are all very good coasters as well, and they have a ridiculous selection following.

2.) SFGAm - A big selection of fun coasters.  Again, the RMC is a standout, but I also really enjoyed Raging Bull, X-Flight, Batman, and the wooden coasters.

3.) St. Louis - 

4.) Discovery Kingdom - 

5.) Elitch Gardens - when it was a Six Flags park."
Really? It's pretty widely available where I live. Most pubs and stores carry it!
Monster was soo good
