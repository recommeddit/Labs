"Well see it's no wonder he didn't do so well when the best team Australia has seen left, the average for Ponting's wonder team was only 2 points less than Waugh's, third best of all time. You could say Waugh rode on Tubby's coat tails, and Tubby on Border's coat tails."
"A few people have suggested grid, but I’ve put about 40 hours into that career mode and there really isn’t much in the way of a garage of cars that you own afaik. It puts you kore in the role of a driver-for-hire; you get “offers” in different racing disciplines from fictional teams. Then you use the car they provide you for that season

There’s a good variety of cars you’ll end up racing, but you don’t really upgrade and customize them. Not in career mode at least, maybe I’m missing these options for online multiplayer

Having said all that, if you’re looking for some sim-ish racing, it really is as good as it gets on switch. It’s got a lot of notable tracks and some fun fake-street circuits

If you want to have a car collection a la GT/Forza, I don’t think it’ll scratch that itch, but the racing is quite good imo"
I think the iPhone 7 Plus deserve to be in tiers 2 because it has introduced the portrait mode and the water resistance
"Stringent rules, a good distribution system, and the type of soil that functions as a good filtration system. The place where our local water comes from is also a natural area, the sort of place you'd put on the bottle if you were to sell it."
"Wow, what a difference between the 10600k and 3600. Throw in the difference in prices for a cooler and motherboard as well, and it gets really hard to justify going for the Intel one, even if it has higher FPS."
Wormwood (2017).

">Atlantic Cod, possibly the tastiest of all the fishes

I could name at least 5 different fish that taste better than cod."
John Varvatos classic? I do!
They don't smell *that* different. I'm pretty sure I could tell if someone is using Armani Code or Bvlgari Aqva on just about everyone.
Time tree for sure
wasn't trying to be a smartass. guess im just a slow reader and wasn't sure if there is maybe a shorter version

"My dad passed a few years before and that year while going through some boxes hidden in my room, i found a bible that he received from college. He had written his name and notes throughout the book. That Christmas someone cut a lot of onions."
"If you have any blogger friends who like Gintama, ask them to publish a list of their favorites!  Maybe it'll enter the top 100 in the future."
"Studying abroad in Spain right now and I'm from Kentucky in the US. Back home it is all southern/country food all the time. However, here... it's a croissante and a coffee. I've had some culture shock."
"HBO and Netflix subscriptions. We share them so I don't mind paying for it each month, but his mind is still blown by how cool streaming services are."
"I know it may too late at this point, but you have the kid for 18 years knowing they may go to college. It shouldn't be a surprise extra expensive at 18. It should have been something you have been saving for for 18 years. Which makes CSU's more than affordable with even conservative returns.

Edit: Not sure how saving for college is a controversial statement. Open a 529 in grandparents name at the time of child's birth and throw whatever you can afford into it. Even $100/month would be $40,000 by 18. That almost pays for an entire CSU education."
We might be book soulmates. I’m gonna have to read Chloe Liese now.
It's almost like he's just really really bored.
The type of movie that makes you saying wtf until that one moment where everything makes sense

Repose Grey is the color we have used in both our houses.
