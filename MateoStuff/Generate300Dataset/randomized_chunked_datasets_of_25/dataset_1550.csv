Working!! 

Not my top favorite ever (although some of them are on my top favorite) but they to me are must watches."
18040,best Kardashian,"I agree re: Kylie. My boyfriend (i got him into watching it with me even though he used to roast me for watching/talking about KUWTK) & I talk about how fake Kylie is/seems to be, not even her fillers, etc just her personality. In the interviews on the show she speaks so slowly it seems like she’s being very careful with everything she says & you never see her real true personality. That being said, she really is a brilliant (while not necessarily self-made) businesswoman & a really good mom to Stormi."

4568,best text editor,"I chose vi to learn as an editor because of it's pervasive default availability in the \*NIX world, so I use it as my primary editor on everything, even Window$."
58638,best cologne,Deodorant lol
6906,best iPhone,"Its actually worse than it, for the SE, it uses new specs but old design.

The 5C just uses the 5 internals, which is a gen older, plus they removed the aluminium frame for the colorful plastic."
