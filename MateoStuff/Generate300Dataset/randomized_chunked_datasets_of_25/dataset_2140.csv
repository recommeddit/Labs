It's awesome.",best action and adventure novel series

12767,"For the last several years, my daughter and I developed sort of a tradition. We'd wake up, she'd make breakfast, then we'd drive to Encinitas, picking up strawberries along the way to Quail Botanical Gardens, where we'd spend a few hours just wandering around and enjoying the chocolate (they do a small chocolate festival there on Mother's Day), and the plants, and the various gardens. Then we would head home and have dinner and watch a movie. Simple, but so lovely. Unfortunately, my transmission went out on my car so we'll have to forgo that tradition this year, but she's already planning her alternative. 

Other than that, what I want more than anything is for my daughter and I to be able to go out to Minnesota to see *my* mom, whom we both miss a great deal!

Just wanted to add: I understand all the moms in this thread wanting a ""day off"" from the rigors of small children. Raising kids is exhausting. I personally don't think I would enjoy that myself, though. I enjoyed a day of no housework, sure, but spending the day with my kids was always the very best part of Mother's Day for me.",best gifts for mom
