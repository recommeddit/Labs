"It's not the quickest (prep and eat time is a little over 30 minutes), but every morning I have egg whites, half a grapefruit, and two slices of salmon avocado toast. It's about 550 calories, but it keeps me full and satisfied until the late afternoon."
"no banter. if there was banter it was boring and unfunny.

also bc of the organic webs he didn’t have any good scenes showcasing his intelligence which is a big part of peter’s identity. didn’t develop any web shooters so we just gotta take the movie’s word for it “he’s in college and other scientists like him”.

My grandmother threw out about 500lbs of my grandfather's old olympic plates in March and it made me so sad when I found out. Those wouldve gone for like $1500+ back then.

"Drake Bell came to my college last year and sang/played guitar. He was big when most of us were grade schoolers, but he does next to nothing now.
