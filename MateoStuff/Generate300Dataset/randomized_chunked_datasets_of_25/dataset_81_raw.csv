"Next do microphones.  I have several in my collection and a bunch more at work, and the one I have from the early sixties is the one that sounds the most accurate.

EDIT: I fail to see why I have downvotes"
"Does the filter in my Brita really need to be changed once a month?  Isn't this, (I apologize if i'm using the wrong term) a *mechanical* process?"
recency bias much. It was a fun movie but to say that it is immediately the best one is a bit strange.

"Other than Hayden and Smith, all the other Aussie bats are average to shit against spin. Our guys perform anywhere.

Peak Tendulkar, peak Gavaskar, peak Dravid, peak Kohli and peak Sehwag is a motherfucker of a batting line up and you'll be lucky to get them 4 or 5 down."
"It is indeed a massive amount, but there are a few competitors that can output 100w, most of them are way more expensive.

I would be able to validate if the power bank can put out 100w or not, and if it can't I would get it returned/refunded by Amazon for false advertising."
