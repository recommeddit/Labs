45066,best items under $100,I got one of those air couches last week for $30 down from $100. All my friends judged my purchase but it's so fucking comfortable and portable. Oh camping and wanna sit down? Not on my couch.
44912,best items under $100,I was going to say a water pick as well
26185,best politician,"I can't name a favorite (not well versed enough to know many past politicians), but I know William Weld, the current Libertarian VP, really interests me in that he actually went to the Republican convention in 1996 and tried to bring a more socially liberal aspect to the party. I really respect him for trying. He's the kind of republican I would consider voting for, especially with his success in Massachusetts."
45475,best gaming system,"If I remember right, you don’t even need an actual address. You can send something labeled as General Delivery to the person’s nearest post office and they can pick it up with an ID. Def check Google , but I’m pretty sure I did that back in 2015 when I was living somewhere semi remote for work."
15354,best tree for the garden,I hate tree puns. I'm twiggerred.
24261,best anime,"If you like Slice of Life and Shaft you will love this show. Its literally all I wanted after I watched Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Madoka Magica and the Monogatari Series. Still one of if not the top Slice of Life to this day for me."
47749,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,TI Nspire CAS can do everything
66677,best soccer team in the world,"Not really because Netherlands consistently has had good squads since the early 70s. 3 World Cup finals, one of the best Euro records in the game and won it once. Belgium has/had a golden generation but before that they were straight poopoo for a long time. Cannot compare the two nations"
8817,best toothpaste,"If you’ve got tooth pain, there is literally no better ~~medicine~~ **painkiller**, I will say that much.  
  
FTFY"
38097,best Marvel movie,"This makes me sad. BP was good, but not even close to the best MCU movie"
42331,movies like Inception,"Came to recommend eXistenz, thanks for doing the good work.  Side note, it's on Netflix now!"
13242,best gifts for mom,"My favorite gift since having our babies has been my ipad. I love having something light and easy to hold with one hand, and I was happy to be able to read books and magazines easily while rocking the baby at night."
63388,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"[[Installer 5]] is kind of a package manager but also a tweak but honestly it’s so worth it for using JUST for its Batchomatic-like functionality. If something goes wrong and you have to Restore RootFS, it feels SO good to know that you can just restore everything and NOT have to spend hours and hours figuring out your old setup. 

Always remember to only back up your setup when you’re relatively sure your current setup is pretty stable!"
59964,best perfume,"Fun fact, White Shoulder turns into baby vomit on my skin. Really pisses me off too..."
69807,best major to study in college,"I have been thinking about trade as well. People know how to code I doubt knows how to wire their house or fix their plumbing. Or better yet, they probably don't want to do that messy stuff."
46920,best hand santizer brand,"The other thing that alcohol-based rinses may do is cause dry mouth, which (rather ironically) leads to bacteria being able to proliferate more freely."
51314,best iphone case,"In my experience with the Otterbox clear cases, the entire back of it doesn't discolor at all but the flexible part (the sides that go around the button etc) does change color a bit. I didn't find it ugly, but I did notice it in the end!"
69235,best major to study in college,How are your taxes that high at that salary level?
29700,best game console,"Without getting into the major franchises, I have a few gems for PS2:

* [Dropship: United Peace Force](http://www.ign.com/games/dropship-united-peace-force/ps2-14437)
* [R.A.D - Robot Alchemic Drive](www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJW2WiY_ULk)
* [Maximo: Ghosts to Glory](www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut1pLnIkXdM)
* [Maximo vs Army of Zen](www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAVTuWV9xqY)

I think Nippon Ichi had a good run on PS2 with titles such as: 

* [Makai Kingdom](http://www.ign.com/games/makai-kingdom-chronicles-of-the-sacred-tome/ps2-714345)
* [Disgaea: Hour of Darkness](www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_GfpyEKYGQ)
* [Phantom Brave](http://www.ign.com/games/phantom-brave/ps2-617701)
* [Soul Nomad and the World Eaters](www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGPGRTMGsI)"
68268,best science fiction novel,"No order:

Dune - an absolute classic, lots of interesting stuff going on here, economics, cultures, history, drugs, ecology. (The first 4 are all brilliant to me).

Player of games - probably my favorite banks sci fi novel, (excession is really good to and use of weapons), interesting story, good world building, good social critique.

The three stigmata of palmer eldritch - every book i have read by pkd has been impressive, this one sticks in my mind as being particularly frightening though, (not knowing what's real etc).

Brave new world - probably a bit dated now but blew my mind when i was younger and made me view the world differently. 

Hyperion - great world that feels very fleshed out and detailed, covers so many different sci fi concepts partly due to its semi short story format, my experience with this was via audiobook which was great.


Special mentions:

1984 - introduced me to the genre and got me interested in reading in general.

The lathe of heaven - like one of pkd's better books and introduced me to taoism.

The shadow of the torturer - only read the 1st part of this four part story, (botns) keen to tackle the rest. Very unique world and writing."
51532,best iphone case,Apples own leather cases. I am waiting for the Mous Clarity to be released.
19118,best YouTube video,"[Shiey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXwMqnXfJzazKS5fJ8nrVw) has no ads, clickbait, sponsored posts, and the vibe of his content is amazing. He mostly does train surfing, exploring abandoned military locations, and stuff like that. Each video is like a journal."
69785,best major to study in college,"You can pay off your entire student loans in one year if you wanted. But yes, of course, you don't go into neurosurgery expecting it to be easy and to want to FIRE. You do it because you have a sick passion and don't give a shit about sleep. My brother's girlfriend is a neurosurgery resident. She can't stay awake for more than 10 minutes when watching a tv show or movie on her maybe 2 days off a month."
13894,best research paper archive,What has really helped my scientific writing alot is editing articles in Wikipedia. Perhaps an assignment for your students could be to edit or write (or atleast verify) an article on the site?
