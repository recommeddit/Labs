33848,best Pokemon game,"What makes this difficult is that you're looking at it though a lens that nobody else is. Each of us got into the series in different games and like the things that are present in the game that made us fall in love with the series.

You seem to like moon, which is story heavy, I would point you towards the latest games for that, from black on.

I like the gameplay and freedom of the originals, to me Crystal and SoulSilver represent the pinnacle of the series (the original formula refined), and I dislike the newer entries.

It all depends on what you like about pokemon."

13313,best spreadsheet editor,"Let's say you have a drop down menu for people with titles in front of their names: Doctor Who, Doctor Yu, Doctor Shu, Cowboy Ox, Cowboy Lox, and Cowboy Nocs. 

In Excel, you can click on the dropdown menu and pick the name you want. Click on Doctor Who and get Doctor Who.

Google sheets is the same, but also allows you to type into the field and the drop down menu will update base on your entry. Doctor W will get Doctor Who, but ox will get you Cowboy Ox and Cowboy Lox. So you can search through the dropdown menu without having to do anything more than filling out the data validation.

40973,best instrument to play,"> I cannot personally understand how a guitar could be better for scales and intervals then a guitar

I guess the second ""guitar"" is a typo for ""piano"".  ;-)

What I meant was that the fret pattern shows you the scale structure.  On piano, the notes ABCDEFGA are all evenly spaced - visually on the keyboard.  The black notes look like a kind of afterthought (which is what I meant by the keyboard being ""historically informative"").  On guitar (on the A string) you see the 2-1-2-2-1-2-2 fret pattern.  The guitar is not biased towards C major / A minor.  

Also, the guitar makes a good test bed for demonstrating the harmonic series, and the mathematical basis of perfect intervals.  Again, working with one string only.  (And bowed strings would be just as good for that, seeing as the frets are kind of misleading, being in equal temperament.)

Otherwise - yes, for theory, the piano wins hands down. :-)  (Ha, ""hands down"", literally! :-D)"

52512,best hiphop album,"For me, it's Madvillainy

Everything about this album is beyond cool, from the actual content to the story behind it.

I love how Madlib seamlessly ""spends"" lots of awesome beats for skits and short tracks, any other beatmaker would stretch each one for 3-4 minutes. His beats, man, they just come out of nowhere and in a minute or so disappear completely leaving you struck. And Doom is a perfect company for this type of musical thinking."

24061,best anime,"I'll go ahead and throw mine in. This does raise an interesting question that I've discussed before; is there a difference between ""must watch"" and ""top anime""? IMO there is, and the defining difference in what makes an anime ""must watch"" is it's influence on the medium and it's fans. 

1. [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion) - Perhaps the most influential anime to come out in the last 2 decades and one of the most influential of all time. It appears to be a mecha anime on the surface, but it is not really about the mecha. The focus of this anime is on the psyches of it's characters and how having the responsibility of protecting the world effects them. Because of it's influence on the medium, extremely high level of popularity, the amount of discussion it creates in the fandom, and it's critical acclaim, I consider this to be *by far* the biggest must-watch for any anime fan. That said, it is a polarizing anime and although there are many that love it, there are many others that hate it. Love it or hate it, you still must watch it.

2. [Madoka Magica](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka%E2%98%85Magica) - Extremely popular and critically acclaimed. You may think this is a cutesy magical girl anime, but appearances can be deceiving. It's best to watch this anime while knowing as little about it as possible, and also to watch it as quickly as possible because spoiler-filled discussions about it occur daily in most online anime communities. Well regarded for it's fantastic story, excellent OST, and beautiful art-style, it's an anime that does so many things excellent and may as close to flawless in it's execution as any anime in existence. That said, it's not an anime with universal appeal so you shouldn't just assume you'll love it...in fact you might hate it. It is important though to understand why others love it as much as they do so you can have a civilized discussion about it with others. 

You listed AOT and FMA: Brotherhood, which despite my not liking them as much as my first 2 entries, are anime I also consider to be among the top 6 in my ""must watch"" list. Discussion about AOT is starting to fade though so it may fall off that list in the future. In fact, I should probably include something like Steins;Gate instead, because even though it's older and not ongoing, I see it mentioned more often than AOT. FMA: Brotherhood belongs on the list because of it's popularity and has near universal appeal. Unlike Madoka and Evangelion, almost nobody hates FMA, so it's extremely likely anyone could enjoy that anime. 

My final 2 are [Cowboy Bebop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) because it is considered a classic, is very popular, and is almost universally recognized as being excellent and [Hayao Miyazaki's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki#Filmography) top movies, which include Spirited Away, Mononoke Hime, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, and others. Hayao Miyazaki is one of, if not the most influential people involved in making anime during the past half century. His movies have a very wide appeal so they are quite popular, and for the most part also get a large degree of critical acclaim."

72370,best keyboard switches,"> Buckling spring and Cherry MX Green are fairly similar. By no means are they exactly alike; unfortunately, it's not too easy to describe the intricate differences in a flowchart. But there's no question--if you're after a heavy, clicky switch, you're deciding between buckling spring and greens. If you think it would be cool to own a vintage board, you'll get a heavy/clicky experience from a Model M. If you want a modern board, you'll have to go with greens.

I strongly disagree with this. Greens are rated 80g while buckling springs are only 65g. While heavier than most other options, they're far enough apart from each other that they shouldn't be grouped together like that . Furthermore, the feel of the click is *very* different, with buckling springs feeling more solid/substantial than a cherry switch. To say you should only go with them for retro charm is doing them a huge disservice. Unicomp sells boards with USB, window keys and in black so the only ""modern"" thing you miss out on would be backlighting."
