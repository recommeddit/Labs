Yeah i’d like two packs of “Light fraud” please...
"I went to visit my best friend who was stationed at Ft. Leavenworth and it just happened to be the American Royal weekend- amazing. Also, the downtown scene was bananas, we decided to buy the bar a round of shots because we're from California and $3 shots on a Friday night was too good to not share, met a surgeon and his wife there and they took us to some great club and we danced and she called two of her single friends to meet us. It was great, the people were hella nice, and I always recommend it.

Plus, river boat casinos!"
"Well now I’m bummed out. It’s Audible only, no print or ebook edition."
"Definitely read the title as ""Whoa, Pooh has an ASSHOLE,"" and spent about 2 minutes scrolling up and down scrutinizing the drawings, thinking that must be a very discreet asshole."
"Got a compliment from a dude on this one (it is one of his favorites) lol.

Compliments from women? I've gotten them for Prada Luna Rossa Sport, Hugo Boss Bottled, Ferrari Leather Essence, Burberry London, I think there may be another one or two I am missing.

Ninja edit: Mont Blanc Legend, Kenneth Cole Mankind Hero... I think that is it."
Have you read Boyfriend Material by Alexis Hall? It is my new go-to recommendation when someone mentions they enjoyed RWRB. I laughed out loud so many times and think I actually love it more than RWRB!
Ubuntu or Manjaro. The latter will be a bit of a steeper learning curve but is still quite easy for beginners.
lg27gl83a OR Lenovo y27q20
that is bad :(
"Spigen clear case has this, it allows the phone to sit flat."
Coffee Ice Cream all the way. I have always said its like eating the smell of coffee.
"Literally *hundreds* of views

People's preferences don't correlate to quality"
you don't start at a position like quarterback for 20 straight years being shitty at what you do... or anything less than elite for that matter.
"The problem with hosting services is that they have their pros - and they have their cons. I use BlueHost but I’m not going to shy away from the fact that they have things that I DON’T like about them. There’s no magic bullet in the WP hosting world. None of them are perfect. BlueHost isn’t perfect, but neither is SiteGround or DreamHost. I challenge anyone to defy me and say they are. I also challenge anyone to defy me and say they’re total shit."
"The Hugo Boss scent my ex always wears. It's like a spell, I always end up sleeping with him again!"
"I keep a 4lb bag of chocolate Muscle Milk around for heavy duty days, or days where I have a long drive to start off my work day with. For quick or light days, I keep an 18-pack of Premier Protein (11oz) around. If it's a heavy day, I do 3 scoops, and then 2 scoops that night. For a light day I just need to get by until 10 or so, then I eat some banana nut bread to carb up through lunch and help me rehydrate and avoid cramps. For long drives I replace breakfast and mid-morning snack with a big, diluted 3-scoop serving so I'm not tempted to eat junk and get all sluggish on the way.

The Premier Protein premade shakes are actually delicious if you like Yoohoos. The Muscle Milk not so much, but it's fatty enough that it's a good option if you're actually working hard. I chug them both as fast as possible, but I enjoy chugging Premier a lot more than Muscle Milk.

Protein shakes aren't cheap if you're just supplementing with them and you're pounding them hard and fast. But dollar for dollar, if you're working hard in rough conditions, they make excellent sense. No bubbly gut from gas station food, no super rich breakfast that makes you sick when you work up a sweat, and nothing to weigh you down. Just pure fuel to go with your cigarettes and red bull. Even with Premier premade shakes, you're still getting breakfast for $1.52 at $24.99/18pk with a 9% sales tax."
"Exactly the opposite, for some reason you're being upvoted so some losers even believe you. 

IN A NUTSHELL: high impedance headphones require powerful source like a good DAC to provide enough power for such impedance. If you plan to use your headphones portable or overall for devices like smartphones, laptops, anything without DAC, just straight to the jack port, you should get as low impedance as possible to have them not demanding regarding the source. If you have a good DAC and you plan to use it only with it then you can for sure go ahead with high impedance. There is a THEORY that lighter coil (the higher the impedance, the thinner the coil so it's lighter) gets you slightly better sound. I don't believe in that, I don't know any blind tests where people could actually tell the difference so don't treat it as a rule.

To sum up, don't listen to this guy."
"The additional material really shines light on how the soldiers feel when they come back to a completely Alien earth. I feel like the parts are very depressing but very illuminating not just on the character's actions but also the author's feelings when he came back from Vietnam.

It was a shame it was ever cut."
That movie had a twist?
Deion Sanders
"And if you don't have friends,  at least have other greedy rich asshole who want the same thing as you."
"That article is incorrect.  Alcohol based hand sanitizer does not just ""strip oils"" it also kills pathogens if the concentration is around 70% (less than that is not very effective, and 100% alcohol is for unknown reasons also less effective).  I learned this in microbiology lab and we regularly used 70% alcohol to clean tables and equipment after it became contaminated with staph and e. coli.

In fact, alcohol is also a better choice than antibacterial soaps since bacteria don't develop resistance to alcohol because, as I recently saw it described by someone on reddit, it's basically the equivalent of lighting them on fire."
