60745,"Easily my favorite. Ever since Dane Cook saturation of the 2000's, I feel edgy, shock comedy just doesn't do it for me. Comedians that can bring the humor while still being something I can recommend to friends, family, and co-workers without worrying about ""that one part"" every skit seems to have is a relief.",Best comedy show on Netflix

3077,"> In theory, you can make a webcam that basically has a smartphone SOC inside it that does all the sophisticated image processing that smartphone cameras can do. However, once you do that, the price of the webcam ballons quickly. Once a webcam costs $300+

You only need look to the fact that amazing camera quality smartphones exists for $100 or less that do everything else a smartphone does, not just capture video, to see why your guess is absolute bullshit. It would barely inflate the cost at all.",best webcamera

65878,"Well you're out of state so you'll pay a lot more. USC definitely costs the most along with Stanford but that's because they are private universities. 

I went to UCLA and I can say, it opened a lot of doors for me. TBH with you both Berkeley and UCLA are considered public ivys so you wouldn't have a problem with alumni networks getting out of school.

The CSU's don't have as good a reputation but they're more cost effective. If you had the choice, definitely UC over CSU.

As for Stanford and USC they speak for themselves. USC, hard for me to admit has an incredible alumni network all over the country. And Stanford, well I don't need to say anything about Stanford.

Note UCLA and Berkeley get a TON of applications so hopefully you're a well rounded student. It's not enough anymore to get just good grades, you have to have extracurriculars, great SAT scores and like a great personal statement.

Either way you choose to go to school at the UCs you get the prestige but it'll cost you a pretty penny.",best college in california

37990,"Anytime something from a movie takes me away from it then it’s like a deduction for me. And with TWS it doesn’t really do that. 

Look at ragnarok for example. There was too much comedy in it although it was written fairly well. It was a dark movie but it was just too cheerful. 

With TWS it all just synced. It’s the first Marvel movie that showed how amazing the films could be. I’ll always give props to the Russos and Markus & McFeely for that",best Marvel movie
