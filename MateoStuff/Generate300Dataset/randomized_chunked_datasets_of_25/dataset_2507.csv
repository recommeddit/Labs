12349,best gifts for mom,"My mother saw this ring once years ago - white, yellow and red Clogau gold oak leaves, wound round into a ring. Really tiny, detailed leaves, gorgeous. She couldn’t afford it at the time, saved up for it, and when she went back it had been discontinued. This was about 7 years ago. 

Last year she realised it was on sale again, and again couldn’t afford it herself. So me, my sister, and my brother-in-law clubbed together to get it for her. She shouted at us for spending so much on her, but she also cried like a baby and hasn’t taken it off since."

36893,best roller coaster at six flags,"I really agree about fiesta texas. IR is the most disappointed ive been on a coaster. the operations were horrible and the crowd was particularly rude (maybe I got unlucky). food was bad, and rides broke down constantly. it was pretty, but honestly I think its one of the least pretty SF parks ive been to. I think SFMM is the prettiest especially during golden hour"
4827,best home improvement store,"I mostly use Lowes, if you have their credit card you get 5% off at the register and they are closer to my house, although I drive by both on my way home from work.  If I'm working on a bigger project I'll compare both based on price and what fixtures/finishes I like more.  Most projects end up being a combination of both as well as a few other sources.  

I used to use Menards mostly but prices got higher, and service got terrible."

46708,best hand santizer brand,"Anything between 60-90% ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) works. It's the same as with isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). Rubbing alcohol is also sold at 99% but this doesn't work, the minimum 10% water is needed to denature the proteins and kill the germs. This is why typical booze doesn't work as a sanitizer. 80 proof vodka is only 40% ethyl alcohol."

42637,best detective show,"The only people I know who were disappointed by POI ore people who gave up in the first season, before it hit its stride.  Season 1 is a little ""procedural"", but in season two they start heading in to the big story and it becomes a thing of beauty.

Not saying there aren't people that don't like it, just saying I don't know any of them."
37914,best Marvel movie,"Yeah, I really do adore all the first half when it’s just about how much Steve wants to serve, but once he starts and the movie goes full camp I think it’s just some of Marvel’s worst stuff"
