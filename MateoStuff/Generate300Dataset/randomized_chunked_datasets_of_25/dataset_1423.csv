54250,best medicine for a cold,"Heat kills a virus.  Take a hot bath, as hot as you can stand it, really, as hot as possible.  While you are in the bath, drink a hot beverage.  The best would be homemade bone broth, but it could be tea, or even just hot water. The goal is to induce an artificial fever. Do this right before bed. Stay in the tub as long as you can stand it, 20 minutes if you can make it. When you get out of the tub, stay as warm as possible, and go to bed immediately, covered in as many blankets as you can stand. Stay under the blankets until you fall asleep. If you can get your body heat high enough, you will kill the virus and feel great when you wake up the next day."

47421,best state to visit in the United States,"Hawaii.  
No, I don't mean Waikiki and the other tourist areas.  
I mean the more real side of Hawaii. Try surfing, go hiking (besides Diamond Head...), go scuba diving, go to farmers markets and local art festivals. Eat at the local restaurants, not the expensive chain restaurants.   
Stay at a hotel outside of Waikiki (or the main tourist areas on the other islands), or Air B&B it, or rent a cabin or something!"

43590,best items under $100,"24(M), I bought a book online about SQL for like 25 bucks and then a course on Udemy for like 11.99?

But went from a job earning 35,000 to 55,000 because I took time to learn a new skill. 

And if I end up staying and becoming a higher level analyst, salary is around 70~75k 

Maybe data analysis isn’t your gig, but learning a skill can be cheap in terms of money: more time consuming than anything but worthwhile."
