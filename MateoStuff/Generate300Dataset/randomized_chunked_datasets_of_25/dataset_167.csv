73027,best Linux distro,"RHEL in production, CentOS in dev.

Why?

Then your company can pay for RHEL to offload some liability. The software is certified for certain hardware too. Enterprise apps are built and certified for RHEL.

It makes corporate types happy.

Why CentOS in dev? It's RHEL without the licensing. If you have enough cash, just get RHEL so external vendors don't complain when testing products and try to blame CentOS."

71300,best movies with a cool twist,"I'm not really sure why this is ""controversial."" It's hard to judge how great a twist actually is when you didn't get to fully experience it yourself.
