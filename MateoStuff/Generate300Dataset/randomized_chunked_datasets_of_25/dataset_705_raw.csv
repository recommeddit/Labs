I have a Berkey and it is awesome.
I have a load of old games on the Xbox one I have no use for If youâ€™d like them too!
"Hereâ€™s my playlist. Little bit different but I got some bangers, dingers, and slippers on there.

The Egyptian or Greek Assassins creed. The combat reminded me of Dark Souls
Sounds like she should do more commercials.
I'm a big Wu-Tang fan. Much respect to Method Man. I'm stoked that he cares about his fans.
"I have to agree with the crowd here. 

If I want to buy something: lowes

If I want to build something: HD"
Yes! Now itâ€™s summer Iâ€™m struggling as the weighted blanket helps me sleep so much better but I wake up absolutely roasting at some point in the night.
I'm making my mum a photo-calendar and sewing her a heating pad filled with cherry seeds.
"I want my kids to sit down and eat a meal with me that they help their mom prepare. Without phones,iPods/iPads, or the TV being on. Just them telling me stories about their day and if they discovered anything magical. We are always a very busy family, and they are growing up so fast, (7 &15) I just don't want to miss anything they are experiencing. I want them to be happy, and I want to be there to see that happiness on their faces."

Thereâ€™s not even a point to owning a cheap can opener... gotta go right for the good ones.
Runny yolks good. Runny whites bad.
"True, but all that stuff was written and signed here. It's even on money if you like $2 bills. We just get defensive about it ðŸ˜‚"
I love circus peanuts. Yum! Hate anything nutty. And no peanut butter. Yuck.
"Nah I think Forbidden Island is just fine as ""Pandemic Jr."". It's good for introducing people to board games or for groups that can only handle super light games (like family nights). If I'm going to up the complexity, I'd rather just play actual Pandemic."
"Also hardboiled eggs, sliced peppers, tomatoes, fruit, unfiltered honey.  German breakfasts were the best."
Probably the same one who claimed Dark Phoenix is the best superhero movie of the year.

"Two eggs fried over easy, three slices of bacon. 

who the hell needs toast"
"Hey twin! I'm glad we are alike :D 

I actually agree with you about FF7, it didn't age well at all. It's still one of the best games if you put that aside. If someone can't stand cubical graphics, it's better they don't try it lol

I'm definitely going to give Nier a try, once I finish my huge collection of unfinished games lmao"
I haven't had to depill the socks yet but I have a cheapy electric depiller that I use on all my woolens. A fellow DT lover. I blame my SO who's into high quality active/outdoor gear. My first pair of DT was from a liquidation sale so 50% off reg. retail. My subsequent pairs were all full priced.
"GTA 5 should give you enjoyment long enough to save up for more games. The Xbox 360 is a solid first console, the games are really cheap right now."
"If not for the fact that Iâ€™m not tall, youâ€™d see me as super tall."
"Just brush regularly, a decent one would work. Only thing you should avoid is cheap whitening ones. They destroy your enamel slowly under the work of ""whitenening""."
