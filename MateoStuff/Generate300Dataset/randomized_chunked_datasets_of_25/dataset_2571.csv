37041,best roller coaster at six flags,"Welcome to our country! Hope you like Cali, but i have a bone to pick with you. Scream, Riddlers Revenge and Batman almost suck the big one? Seriously? Those rides are fantastic, if a little rocky and relatively ""old"". I do agree with you on the theming though (Scream especially). But they definitely went for thrill over theme, and in most cases it doesn't bother me because frankly the thrill of the ride outweighs any lack of theme or scenery."

Not as full featured as the stand-a-lone desktop versions, but at least you don't have to worry about conversions etc later on if you do get the full version...

Cheers,

On a serious note, 3rd party on its own is a stupid reason not to use some tool. If there is a technical reason, a security concern, fine. But just cause 3rd party? Come on."

Can't really go wrong with Harper's Ferry.

22560,best celebrity,"Met Harrison Ford in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I'm from Mexico, we were at a private airstrip loading up an airplane onto a flatbed, out of nowhere this guy starts helping us. My co-worker tells me the guy is Harrison Ford I dismiss his remarks, upon further inspection I realize it is indeed Mr. Ford. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met. As a matter of fact he left and left his private hangar open for us to use any tools or whatever we needed. Keep in mind we were about 6 mexicans, I was the only english speaking one............Have commented this same story many times before."

49036,best gaming monitor,"LG 27GL850 or  27GL83a. A lot of reviewers saying the significant price difference isn't worth the upgrade though to the 850. The 850 has a ""better"" color gamut that most people won't notice. It also has ""nano ips"" which is their tech term for fast response time on IPS but reviewers say it's not a significant difference. Unless u got money to burn, just stick to the 83a. 

I personally wouldn't buy other monitors. It's LG man, they've been making monitor and TV panels for decades now. This is what they're known for whereas the other brands are just gaming companies that only know how to slap fancy gaming terms on their monitors."

26372,best politician,"As someone who has worked on a successful campaign before, Money fuels elections, but people win them.  You can flush thousands of dollars of your own money into a campaign, but if you don't have a group of dedicated volunteers to help you strategize, knock on doors, distribute literature, etc., you will fail.

To win an election, you need to start long before the election is even announced - building connections, making friends, earning respect of the community.  Once the campaign starts, these friends will become your volunteers, and they will bring money as well as other friends who will volunteer or bring money and so on.

If you have enough people backing you up who are willing to work hard for you, you can win an election with very little money of your own, substituting sweat and shoe leather for money (for us, it was like a second full time job).  Chances are you will likely still need to put up a good chunk of your own money though so that people know you are serious."
