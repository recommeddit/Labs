Persols are awesome though."

17733,best Kardashian,"I'm also surprised that people are picking Khloe, cz she's literally such a disgusting person. My opinion of her changed after the whole Jordyn saga. Even tho people on here say but Khloe had every right to feel the way she felt. What right does she have to call women bitches that needs to stop fxcking their men. She's the worst of them all."
38102,best Marvel movie,"Infinity War, Endgame, Raknarok, Iron Man, Civil War, Winter Soldier, GOTG, Homecoming, Avengers, and a tie for basically whatever because the rest are kind of similar in many ways. Standard formula stuff. I think I liked Ant-Man more than most people. I'd probably put that above Black Panther and maybe Doctor Strange just because it's a quirky sort of intro instead of boilerplate like BP. Ant-Man and Wasp on the other hand is near the bottom with Thor and stuff."
