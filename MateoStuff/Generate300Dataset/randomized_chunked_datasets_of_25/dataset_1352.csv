51840,best iphone case,"They were from shoppee but most likely the same as AliExpress as well. The overall quality is just very poor, as you can see starting from the black one. Catches lint, colours are very bright, and the fit isnâ€™t well made. The bottom cutout is soft instead of rigid, so itâ€™s a bit loose around the speakers and charging port. The silicone is so thin you can see through to the hard case within. Here are some photos to show you what I mean:

53691,best medicine for a cold,"For me, constantly being tired tends to be a signal that my body is trying to fight something off.  So if I can take a day and just give in to whatever my body is asking for (ie--sleep whenever I get tired and eat whenever I am hungry), I can usually knock it out before it gets bad and decides to hang around forever.  It usually turns into a whole day of ""sleep for about 3 hours, wake up and eat something, instantly fall back asleep for about 3 hours, wake up and eat something, lather, rinse, repeat"".  But it works!!  

Also, I am a big fan of spicy, garlicky chicken noodle soup.  And detox baths."
