23840,"A few people have suggested grid, but I’ve put about 40 hours into that career mode and there really isn’t much in the way of a garage of cars that you own afaik. It puts you kore in the role of a driver-for-hire; you get “offers” in different racing disciplines from fictional teams. Then you use the car they provide you for that season

There’s a good variety of cars you’ll end up racing, but you don’t really upgrade and customize them. Not in career mode at least, maybe I’m missing these options for online multiplayer

Having said all that, if you’re looking for some sim-ish racing, it really is as good as it gets on switch. It’s got a lot of notable tracks and some fun fake-street circuits

If you want to have a car collection a la GT/Forza, I don’t think it’ll scratch that itch, but the racing is quite good imo",best car racing video game

65831,"I know it may too late at this point, but you have the kid for 18 years knowing they may go to college. It shouldn't be a surprise extra expensive at 18. It should have been something you have been saving for for 18 years. Which makes CSU's more than affordable with even conservative returns.

Edit: Not sure how saving for college is a controversial statement. Open a 529 in grandparents name at the time of child's birth and throw whatever you can afford into it. Even $100/month would be $40,000 by 18. That almost pays for an entire CSU education.",best college in california
