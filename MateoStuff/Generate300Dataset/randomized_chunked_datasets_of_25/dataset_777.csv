Edit...I've been looking at TX, can you recommend anything, even if not allinclusive?"

31872,best hotel to live in,"I'm going to sneak a piggy-backed question in here maybe someone can help.  I have a couple of questions about Hard Rock, check in is at 4pm.  I have a park ticket for that first day, can I take advantage of the express pass the day of, or do I have to wait for the day following check in?  Also, can I leave my luggage with them to take to my room when it's ready while I'm in the park?"

8041,best laptop for general use,"I agree with the [**Dell G5 laptop,**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CD3MRZF/ref=twister_B07FKR9DDX?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&tag=laptopz18-20) it is a great price for an i7-8750H 6-core processor and GTX 1050 Ti graphics card. 16 GB of RAM should be enough for you. It will be able to run the programs you listed easily. Tad heavy, but that's the tradeoff for excellent specs."
6831,best iPhone,"Iphone SE 2016, that thing lasted throughout almost anything I could throw at it. Getting lost on ski hills, flipped over canoes etc etc

Loved the design, form factor and 3.5 mm AUX. Still best phone I think they ever released based on value per dollar."
63736,best books for time management reddit,"Not trying to dis you but I found the 7 habits be totally pretentious and devoid of anything actionable.


GTD was my go to book for productivity but as I matured in my time management I realized it was to much focused on efficiency and not on effectiveness which is very problematic.  Since then I have been slowly chipping away on my GTD habits....my new system is basically not GTD oriented as well, takes less upkeep and is a lot more focused on effectiveness instead of completing next actions.

I guess what I am saying is GTD is better than nothing but it takes you to the wrong direction."

57572,best cologne,"Thank you! Now Im looking for an inoffensive cologne for work. Theres someone I really want to think I smell good, but I dont want to annoy anyone in the office. Would YSl L'Homme be more appropriate than La Nuit? Or would Aventus/Green Irish Tweed be better?"
