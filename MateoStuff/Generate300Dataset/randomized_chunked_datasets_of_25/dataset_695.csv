36808,Various different stypes of beer from IPAs to stouts and porters. Ale when I'm in the mood. Of course I'm also quite partial to a nice glass of scotch or bourbon but it's stronger so I wouldn't necessarily drink that as often. I do love a a good Manhattan though!,best alcoholic drink
70094,"Thank you! A lot of people have a hard time realizing this. After you get some experience under your belt, employers will look at that rather than your degree. 

I know a few people that have non-computer related degrees, but work in large data centers or are network admins, because they have tons of experience and know-how. The Computer field is definitely one of the biggest fields in which experience will trump a degree nine times out of ten.",best major to study in college

37140,"Eh depends on the time of the year and day you go. Obviously rides like the dragster will pretty much always have long lines but if you go during down season and late at night its so much improved.  For instance on less busy days I can typically get on the millenium force in 45 minutes, raptor in 25-30 and wicked twister, power tower, gemini, max air, and magnum xl somewhere around 15. Ones like corkscrew, blue streak or matterhorn are obviously short. On the other hand rides like the dragster and maverick are always long (also weirdly some like iron dragon), and during halloweekends its so bad. Just depends on when you go",best amusement park
