25991,best politician,"I'm very good at convincing people of a particular cause as well as very good at understanding people's motivations.

I'm excellent in sales. I can practically sell anyone on any idea - if I try hard enough.

This is why I'm getting involved in Grant Writing - which I think I will enjoy more. I get to help people, without surrendering to political systems.. like you said."
36808,best alcoholic drink,Various different stypes of beer from IPAs to stouts and porters. Ale when I'm in the mood. Of course I'm also quite partial to a nice glass of scotch or bourbon but it's stronger so I wouldn't necessarily drink that as often. I do love a a good Manhattan though!
70094,best major to study in college,"Thank you! A lot of people have a hard time realizing this. After you get some experience under your belt, employers will look at that rather than your degree. 

I know a few people that have non-computer related degrees, but work in large data centers or are network admins, because they have tons of experience and know-how. The Computer field is definitely one of the biggest fields in which experience will trump a degree nine times out of ten."
37714,best Marvel movie,Best: The Avengers Worst: Captain Marvel
64541,Best Nike running shoes,"I picked up a pair of the lunar tempo 2s recently and I've been very impressed! They feel almost as nice to run in as my Zantes and Kinvaras, and I really love the feel of the upper."
67876,best science fiction novel,">Expeditionary force was pretty interesting until Skippy ruined it. 

Damn, I'm just reading that now. Heh.

(I also could not get into Hyperion.)"
37140,best amusement park,"Eh depends on the time of the year and day you go. Obviously rides like the dragster will pretty much always have long lines but if you go during down season and late at night its so much improved.  For instance on less busy days I can typically get on the millenium force in 45 minutes, raptor in 25-30 and wicked twister, power tower, gemini, max air, and magnum xl somewhere around 15. Ones like corkscrew, blue streak or matterhorn are obviously short. On the other hand rides like the dragster and maverick are always long (also weirdly some like iron dragon), and during halloweekends its so bad. Just depends on when you go"
51264,best iphone case,I ordered the golden brown wallet for the same reason. I think it's the only leather color that matches the Sierra Blue nicely.
64437,Best Nike running shoes,I second the vote for New Balance. I buy them pretty much exclusively and would like to know the difference between X and Y shoe.

70977,best movies with a cool twist,Agree and an overall very good movie.
18646,best YouTube video,"8-Bit Guy & Techmoan. Even if you're not interested in vintage computing or audio components, these two are so passionate and have such a laid back way of presenting their knowledge that it's enjoyable."
