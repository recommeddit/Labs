9769,best dorm hall at UCSB,"FT is almost a mile from campus, so if you enjoy biking. It's only a 10 minute or less bike ride though.

I have no experience in ft but they just rebuilt the dining room there so maybe it's better?"
41385,best instrument to play,"Playing guitar is the second best way to get laid. First being roofies, obv."
70532,best major to study in college,"Technical Writing/Interactive Media Production major

Best: Potential jobs are very in-demand (UX/UI Designer, Technical Writer, etc), I get to double-dip with the extended major into TW and IMP classes, not a lot of reading required, but not a lot of math either, and it’s in a STEM field. Also, there are enough upper-division credits to not need extra classes on top of the major. 

Worst: There aren’t really any bad things I can come up with at this point."
17039,best iOS game,The only iOS one I’ve played is Dead Cells. I mean it’s not a platformer per se but it has a lot of platforming.
3771,best college for research,The whole system needs a complete overhaul. I am going to graduate in a few months and the only thing I've learnt is how to pass exams.

13293,best gifts for mom,They need to stop feeling disappointed in you.
55404,best action and adventure novel series,"That it does, but the winds of change are blowing, I think. Most of our authors are self-pub and there's just no beating the ease to publish that Amazon provides for a newbie. However, the hybrid imprints are figuring things out and getting better every day. I have faith that Portal or Wraithmarked or someone will figure out a direct distribution channel to the niche but voracious readers of LitRPG at some point."
26554,best board games,Am reading ;-)

1540,best ice cream flavor,"Lol that makes way more sense for me, thanks. 

Yea, most certainly am not at the professional level. Got my ice cream maker for free. It's pretty old and didn't have a manual. Doesn't matter because ice cream.

So, the tasso ham?"
72899,best Linux distro,"Thank you for your input all. Before posting I had my eye on Arch Linux and after looking at all suggestions and reasoning I think for now I will go this way. 

Linux from Scratch may be a little too far for me and my time restraints although I would have liked too. But the Arch Wiki does look good and a lot of people seem to use and rate. So this for the moment is my choice."

4401,best text editor,"I keep considering switching from vim to VSCode, but I always end up wasting time removing "":w"" from all my files."
36094,best alcoholic drink,"The other great thing about the Sazerac is that when you bring the fixin's to a party, you fulfill the obligation to bring booze, but nobody wants to drink your booze.

Rye whiskey and absinthe? Who the fuck brings *that* to a party? Me, that's who."
10742,best suitcase lock,"You joke, but some folks pack blank-firing starter pistols (TSA treats them just like firearms) for this exact reason."
9015,best toothpaste,"My dentist told me that toothpaste is a minor part of the process and the real cleaning comes from the brushing.
