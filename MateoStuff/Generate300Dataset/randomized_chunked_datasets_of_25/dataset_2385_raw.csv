"I work at a courthouse, and I never graduated college. Most of the new people are trying to get in with criminal justice degrees because it will look good on their resume, and there are a TON of people applying with that major. Very competitive."
"Yea, [that shit](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&safe=off&um=1&sa=1&q=mary+jane&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g10&start=0) is terrible."
The 11 and XR are LCD displays. Just in case you didn't know.
"GRID online does have a limited amount of cosmetic and performace upgrades, but its mostly locked behind a level cap for each car. I have been playing since launch and even now with millions in cash, I cant upgrade my cars engine or drivetrain because the car needs to be a lvl50 for those mods, and im still at lvl20 on my most used car. I guess it would work better if there was a bigger online community for the game."
"Exactly the same experience. I had to put a PC in the living room to play immersive games on the OLED Bc the gl850 black levels were so garbage. Now I just use it for competitive games and work, because other than contrast/black levels it’s a very good monitor."
"this ""twist"" has so many parts wrong with it once you rewatch the movie. increased strength ability, driving a truck and gettin' beej's from disembodied heads, etc.

maybe that last one was just part of some fantasy that the viewer is seen as manifesting, when it's not actually reality? i dont know. but I do enjoy this movie and should rewatch it sometime"
Thanks for the feedback. How was the weather in October?
Firefox is the only one I would trust.
What country is Xi eating now?
"What I think they meant was that they want to be able to manage files as root, not the entire GUI, this definitely could be implemented securely. The only ""workaround"" for creating/removing files/directories as root is to open a terminal emulator and do it there."
"I recently bought a case for my phone that is also a battery. It makes my phone thicker and heavier, but the battery adds 150 percent battery life. I've been saying for years that you could double the size of my phone if I could have a bigger battery, and more I have it and it is exactly as awesome as I imagined it to be"
"My mum fucking loves Kate Spade purses.  Of course, Kate Spade is pricey af.  But last Christmas, I got her this wallet that she had been admiring for months.  And proceeded to cry because she got the wallet she had always wanted."
"Looking for a 2-in-1 laptop. Currently I have the Flex 14 and I have no complaints. However, it is about that time to upgrade. I’d prefer a smaller laptop, specs don’t have much significance with my type of usage."
WWI has to be one of the blackest spots in the history of our civilization.  The events leading up to the War are just as interesting as the aftermath imo.
Is Spaced streaming anywhere?

"Hi, how much do weight and battery life matter to you?"

"Nintendo Switch 

Its a great companion console for PC and has BotW"
"Yeah, it was just a random follow the directions on the box number. Your post was very helpful. Thank you for how clearly you explained the options."
How did you come about this information?
"You can adjust that in the settings by unchecking the box that says ""allow some advertising"""
"It's a sinus.

Some women actually have slight nasal congestion after an orgasm."
"What do you want to do?  


Gaming + Normal usage? : Manjaro / POP!\_OS (depending on what you like more and if you need the AUR)  


Just normal usage? : POP!\_OS / KDE Neon / Fedora / openSUSE (I would recommend KDE Neon or POP!\_OS because they get the most support and are both Debian / Ubuntu based.)"
"Are these definitive? I absolutely love this list. It’s very experimental though. For someone who just got into hip-hop, (I’m assuming this person is since they just listened to illmatic) I don’t think Danny brown is a good representation of hip-hop. Yes, it is an amazing album. It’s my favorite rap album of all time, in fact. But I’ve lived most of my life building a foundation for hip-hop, and yet it was still a little tough listening to AE for the first time. It’s rough, beautiful, intense, calming, and anxious. I do think man on the moon is definitive, you definitely have definitive albums on your list, I just think it takes some experienced ears to fully enjoy Danny brown, earl sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, I’d also put Aesop rock in that grouping. (I know you didn’t mention him, but I don’t wanna leave him unmentioned)"
