28531,best breakfast foods,"i make banana bread that is mostly fruit. no added sugar. 

200g dates

60g butter

spoonful of cinnamon

5 bananas

150g wholemeal flour

pinch of salt

2 eggs.

teaspoon baking soda


put dates into pan with water level to the dates, put butter in pan, turn on full heat, mash and boil dates into a jam like texture. 
4 bananas in bowl, roughly mash, add date mixture, add cinnamon, add salt add eggs.

mix flour and baking soda, add to fruit mixture.

pour mixture in greaseproof paper lined loaf tin. 

chop banana into 3 segments, chop each segment in half and place lovingly across the top of the loaf. 
put in oven at 160 celcius for 1-1 hour and a half. 
for a nice crust you can add a bit of sugar to the top so it caramelises the bananas aswell.  
loaf will last 5 days covered."
25222,best spiderman actor,"Tom and no one else. I liked Toby once upon a time but since Civil War Tom is Peter and Tom is Spider-man and no one else. I disliked Andrew the most and like to pretend that two movies don't exist. No hate, just my opinion."

17241,best iOS game,"On easy, you could probably get away with churning out units or paratroopers to the frontlines and win. Eventually, you’ll want to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the units and officers to win against more enemies or increased difficulty."
27012,best board games,"The TTS Club Discord server is great, but there are also some good servers for specific games.

You mentioned Dune, so here's an active server for the game:

60247,best freezer brand,"We live in Florida, so really cold days are hard to come by and humidity abounds.  We don't have a basement (Florida) so it will be kept in a garage."
23768,best car racing video game,"Gran Turismo 3 until 5. Those games were my entire childhood. I remember buying a PS3 Slim the day 5 came out, when I was 11 years old. Grinded up for weeks, and started online racing. Fuck I loved that game so much, I just wish RPCS3 would support it already."
15093,best romantic novel,"Have a pretty long list.  I like both paranormal and contemporary.  My favorite paranormal is the Afterlife Saga, original and long, 12 books, it's by Stephanie Hudson.  I also enjoy the ones that can make me laugh and cry.  The Blue Moon series is funny and a there are about a town where hippies got lost on the way back from woodstock.  The town is just as funny as the main characters and their love interests.  For steamy ones that are also paranormal the Discovery of Witches trilogy was amazing and I googled so many historical references while reading.  I also loved the sexy Chosen by the Vampire Kings and the Program Series by Charlene Hardnady.  The Sugartown series was also really good and funny as well.  So many more that I can't remember off the top of my head."
40507,best midrange GPU,"I would recommend the rx 480 4gb I've been seeing them from around 200-250 dollars on used websites like ebay, offer up, and FB marketplace (rx 480 4GB out performs the rx 570 4gb)"
69618,best major to study in college,"Foreign languages if you plan on moving to the country you are majoring in. At least double major so you can do something there. I can’t tell you how many people I knew majoring in French that wanted to move to France and work there.

I double majored and so far it has worked out for me, but not so much for the people who planned to move abroad with no other degree or plan."
24208,best anime,"I kinda expected DRRR to be where it is. It's probably in my top 10, if not top 5, but I can see why people might not think it's very memorable. It only really shows how great it truly is after the first or maybe even the second rewatch. All the details, the foreshadowing and the connections can't be seen on the first watch. 

Anyone who's rewatched it at least once will 100% have it in their top 100 imo, but that's the problem, many people don't do that.

54865,best water filter,"This example is a bit anecdotal. 
Yes, metals and ions are pretty likely to be removed, I disagree that organic molecules remain.  

I've explained this elsewhere in this thread, so I'll be brief here.  Activated Carbon is the stuff in Brita filters that do most of the treatment of water.  Activated carbon is often used in water treatment systems to remove organic matter from water, to prevent the formation of disinfection by-products, or it is used to remove disinfection by-products.

[This paper analyzed home use water filters for their removal of disinfection by products (which are organic molecules)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jctb.1087/full) and found that they had good performance."

73873,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I can give you my experience from three I've tried:

- [**Moko:**](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07KXD4LHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Very abrasive. So much that it actually abraded my fingertips and wore out a pencil tip in a matter of weeks. Very grainy picture. Best to avoid.
- **Paperlike (1st generation):** Very fine. Like drawing on a piece of fine cartridge paper laying over glass. Good for people who want to retain image quality and just want a little paper-likeness.
- [**Elecom:**](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07KZ35N37/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) The sweet spot. Much closer to drawing on sketchbook paper, but similarly over glass. Minimal nib-wear and not too much compromise on screen quality.

The newer generation paperlikes would probably be a good idea if you just want a little bit of a paper feel. Otherwise I highly recommend Elecom."
2382,best headphones,"Audeze Penrose X for a “headset”.

Planar magnetic drivers. Great sound. Works over 2.4GHz Wireless USB or Bluetooth 5.0. Detachable microphone tuned in collaboration with Shure. Works on every platform.

Downside is just limited range distance for 2.4GHz usage, but I set up my dongle such that it shouldn’t be an issue if I need to move from my desk to the nearby kitchen and stay connected."
