"chocolate was ALWAYS the best candy. Even the small ""fun size"" candy bars were better than non-chocolate candy.

Hard candy was the pits. 

And mary janes were THE worst candy of all."
Tom Holland. He fit the role and played it so perfectly. Very likable
1 bottle of Pom Wonderful Pomegranate juice. Right when I feel sick.
"The He-Man Remix to ""What's going on"".

It has stood the test of time.

"Dave Chappelle, easily. He’s got two or three and they’re all hilarious. I’d also recommend Neil Brennan’s Three Mics special. He used to write for the Chapelle Show and his stuff is really funny and high key deep."
Time to re-up on the Axe bby
"A list I can definitely agree with and can refer newbies to! Thank you very much for this work!

Looking forward to your movies list!"
"Just want to ask:

In your opinion (without pushing a brand), do you recommend mouthwash and flossing?  And in which order is best?  I brush, floss, and then mouthwash every night.  I have pretty good teeth but I've been told my enamel is weaker than most (some weird genetic trait) so I try to take extremely good care of my teeth, but if it doesn't help, I'd prefer to just forget about it."
"""best meaning what"" it takes care of heavy metals and viruses? vs, a filter that does bigger bugs and taste?"
Vscode ftw
"I don’t know why they needed to make the phone so damned big.  

Even my 8 feels a little big for my run.  Going to an even bigger screen, and a heavier battery to me feels like a huge step back.  

 And before you say Watch is what I should be using for that I’ll say that the battery doesn’t last long enough for any kind of long runs.  Even with the phone with me my watch battery can’t last the whole day on my long run days.   If I add a cell connection and playing music off the watch I shudder to think.  

As for all the other advantages, like wasting more time on social networks and watching you tube those things seem like the kind of good idea that eating an entire dozen donuts in one sitting do. Sure they’re fun to do but I don’t want that all the time anyways."
"So very much this.  I only get to see my son a few times a month.  I have him on Father's Day this year and could not be more thrilled.  Even if all we do is sit and play video games and eat reheated pizza, it would be the best Father's Day ever."
"I'm too late to this thread, so this'll be buried. But this is incorrect and demonstrates how much people do not understand RT. The number is a percentage of how many critics gave the film a positive review, not an indicator of the film's score. If you want to see the actual MCU scores, you need to look at ""Average Rating"", under the ""More Info"" tab. Here are all of the films ranked by average rating:

1. Avengers: Endgame - 8.31/10

2. Black Panther - 8.27/10

3. The Avengers - 8.06/10

"Shutterfly gifts, photos, etc"
"Absolutely right. I’ve been enjoying the hell out of Super Nintendo lately.

Update: Just beat Link to the Past for the first time in 28 years!"
"> Every kids remembers that one house that gave them full sized candy bars every year...

When I read this, I immediately went to Google Maps and lo behold [I found her](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6775+w+bronco+trail&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=40.817312,79.013672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=6775+W+Bronco+Trail,+Peoria,+Maricopa,+Arizona+85383&ll=33.714452,-112.206223&spn=0.005248,0.009645&t=h&z=17&layer=c&cbll=33.715396,-112.207005&panoid=KA5WJXr7nVa6Pm3c53si4A&cbp=12,289.02,,0,11.31)

**NEW TASK: Find *that house* in street view and post it here.**"
"Yeah, cause then you have an orange wall."
Don Cheadle. Gave me a tip on some salmon to buy at Whole Foods.
"Currently, daily express passes are more expensive than staying at one of the hotels that offers it as a perk. And generally speaking, if there is more than one person in your party, the hotels are always the cheaper option.

That said,  I also prefer Cabana Bay. I always stay in a room that is closer to Volcano Bay than to the resort pool!"
Most of the classics have been mentioned so I'm going to recommend Romancing the Stone which is a fun action adventure comedy.
Are you a bear?
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
"Girls without hobbies are huge red flags for this very reason. YOU become their hobby.

And if I'm totally honest with myself, I'm kind of fucking boring. So you want me to be your entertainment and fun, but I don't want to do any of that.

My wife also has her own interests and hobbies. If I say ""I want to play some video games..."" she says ""Okay, good, because I want to binge watch this entire season of Dowton Abby."" It's literally wonderful.

Sadly, she shot down my idea of having two TVs in the living room where I could game with headphones on while still sitting next to her. ...*sigh* someday, maybe..."
AD is born is the 90s lol that never registered with me.
"McGrath is arguably the best example of a true metronomic bowler. He could stick a ball on his line and length each and every time without fail. Hadlee and McGrath were not ""about the same"" with the ball in that regard at all, and if the measure of who I picked for that spot was to be based on batting ability, I'd have chosen Imran Khan, who is one of the three great all rounders, with Kallis and Sobers. 

My own final question on the side that I listed was Steyn or Khan, but considering the shear depth of batting in the top order, and the strike potential of Steyn, it ultimately came down to that to decide for me. But again, in terms of bowlers you could field around 5 attacks worth of players which all hold claim to be the considered for such positions."
