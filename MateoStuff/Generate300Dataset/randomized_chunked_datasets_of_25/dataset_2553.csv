70839,best movies with a cool twist,"I must not have watched enough of Twin Peaks, but the several seasons I watched seemed pretty droll."
48402,best color to paint with,[Benjamin Moore revere pewter ](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/find-your-color/color/hc-172/revere-pewter?color=HC-172) it’s a nice greige that creates a neutral canvas.
59869,best perfume,"I actually really like Avril Lavigne's Black Star, I used it a lot a few years ago but haven't used perfume in general in a good while"
48374,best color to paint with,Ceiling paint!
17028,best iOS game,"Whoops, I meant to reply to the guy above to recommend other stuff"
26696,best board games,"1. **Rise of Augustus** - Easy to teach, plays fast, scales well between 1-6. First time gamers have no trouble picking it up and veterans can find enjoyment in it too.

2. **Lords of Waterdeep** - Intro to Worker Placement. Can play 6 with the expansion though is probably best between 2-4. Dungeons and a Dragons theme can catch the eye of role players should they come over.

3. **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - Plays good at 4-5 and great at 6-11. Social Deduction, but short rounds and always seems to get everyone involved.

4. **Junkart** - Dexterity game that plays great at 2-5(6?) players. Each round has a slightly different mechanic to keep things interesting. Also teaches some concepts like Card Drafting.

5. **Clank! In! Space!** - Fairly easy to learn Deckbuilder that is fun at all Player counts. Could be replaced with the original if that’s cheaper/a more palatable theme.

6. **Inis** - was going to put **Blood Rage** as I like that game better, but Inis plays better at 2 and is great at 3 and 4. This teaches dudes on the map and really enforces Card Drafting.

7. My Number 7 is going out on a limb: **Exodus Fleet**. Great Role Selection and Auction game that plays well at 2-4. For a more tested game with the auctioning mechanic, pick up **Ra** instead.

8. **Azul** - Pretty Abstract that plays well between 2-4. Also can be played nicely or mean and seems to get better with more experience.

9. **Ghost Stories** - Caveat: I like my Co-ops to be hard, and this one seems to be the best at that without becoming frustrating. Plays best at 1 and 4 so may need to be replaced with **Pandemic** if you will be playing mostly with 2-3 players, though Ghost Stories is not bad at these counts, just not the best.

10. The Deep End Game: **Scythe**, **Great Western Trail**, etc. that mixes a bunch of the mechanics of your easier titles and presents you with an experience that the more gateway titles can’t replicate."
9466,best toothpaste,"It doesn't have SLS. I actually like that part about Prevident, I hate foaming at the mouth like a rabid dog whenever I'm brushing."

33743,best electric car,"They're cool. Different driving experience, but don't seem like they're ready yet (if they'll ever be) to replace internal combustion outright."
47377,best state to visit in the United States,"My suggestion would be to do a ring around Lake Michigan--you could fly into Chicago and do Chicago, which is a fantastic city in its own right. Go up to see Milwaukee, which is a fun city for seeing how heavily settler/immigrant culture has formed the culture of many American cities (in this case, German). Go to Green Bay and watch a Packers game (Go Pack!). Go to the UP of Michigan and see some of the most beautiful nature in the country. Come back across the Mackinac Bridge, which is an absolute feat of engineering. Stop to see Mackinac Island (no cars allowed on the entire island, so it's all bicycles and horse-drawn carriages; very niche and charming). Come down along the west coast of the LP of Michigan--hit Traverse City, attend a concert at Interlochen, visit the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, hit Grand Rapids, Holland, and/or South Haven. There's all kinds of beautiful dunes and beaches and lakeside towns along this route. Also well-known for craft beers and up-and-coming area for wines. Go to South Bend, Indiana, and watch your hockey game at University of Notre Dame. Then head back to Chicago for your flight out."

24142,best anime,"Tokyo Godfathers

Mushishi (just one episdoe)

Nausicaä

I have other favorites, but these are shows I would recommend to people who don't even like Anime.

Mushishi is a series with each episode being a stand alone story and the other two are movies."
7391,best laptop for general use,The only thing I’m worried is that the CAD programs I looked at for minimum requirements recommend a dedicated graphics card which is hard to find in a 2-1 laptop. I’m just not sure if the processor would cover that downfall

66156,best soccer team in the world,"I think you got the wrong pic mate, Kluivert is a starter on this one. Replace him with Seedorf and you have the right team i think.

                 Sar

   Reiziger - Blind - Rijkaard - De Boer

      Seedorf - Litmanen - Davids

      Finidi - De Boer - Overmars"
43004,best detective show,"I really liked mindhunter. The second season was kind of meh but the first one was really good. Still, i wouldnt say the second one was horrible. Just wish it had more ""interviews"" with ""convicted killers"". (Put in quotes because i know theyre just actors. Still i think they did a good job)."
35426,best alcoholic drink,"Do you normally like fireball? I am disgusted by cinnamon whiskey, so I’m wondering if the Gatorade would help at all"
12085,best gifts for dad,"I never understood the idea of buying by the sex. I always by by that person's interests or likes. My brother's gf(s) routinely buy me (female) makeup or body works stuff. Since my skin is extremely sensitive, I cannot use 90% of products. I once broke out in hives from hand lotion."
