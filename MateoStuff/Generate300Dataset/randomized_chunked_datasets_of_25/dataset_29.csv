62915,Best Data Science textbook,"'R for data science' by Hadley and Garrett (available online also: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a decent practical introduction with examples and questions to test yourself with. It is a good read as an introduction, it will provide you with enough skills to jump into more specific follow up texts. 

'Data Science for Business' is a good introduction to understand what machine learning algorithms are doing, which is good for understanding. However, the book does not approach this from a programming point of view, but a conceptual point of view, so you cannot implement it directly in your language of choice.

I have not personally read it but 'Data science from scratch' is meant to be a good introduction that goes through some 'data science theory' and Python code. It would be helpful, though not totally necessary to know a bit of python beforehand.

Someone previously commented to mention 'Elements of statistical learning' which I have seen recommended by people in the industry but with the warning it can be heavy going. 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R' is meant to be an easier introduction, but I have not gone through it myself - it's next on my list."
29172,best web hosting service,"Nice work. Let me tell you all about my own experience. I went with SiteGround after carrying out a lot of research. The StartUp plan was really appealing to me, and wouldn’t cost me much at all for 3 months worth. Small investment, and what’s 3 months? So I went for it. I also used Divi and Elementor and I bought a theme. It’s been good so far, but I get what others mean when they say there is no perfect host. I say this because, whilst I used SiteGround (and enjoyed it), I’ve also used BlueHost in the past who are a little more hit and miss. Not awful, not great - just somewhere in the middle and probably ideal for noobs. 

Like with SiteGround, I signed up to BlueHost for 3 months of WordPress Pro Build. It wasn’t too pricey and I could then go onto buy either another 3 months worth, or even 6 or 12 months. Their support was good and their team was always available. The onboarding process was a bit of a pain because I literally got stuck on the ‘Installing WP’ bit for about 20 minutes and had to refresh - and got stuck again. Interface was good, nice and intuitive, and although the WP dashboard was fairly confusing at first, I soon got the hang of things. That said, does anyone else constantly get the error “no input file specified”? It was a bit of a pain! 

Anyway, that error meant I had to switch to the classic editor. It didn’t work out lol so I restored the backup and then had to contact support. They fired the SSL and domain for me and I was back to normal. All in all, BlueHost was okay but - again - my experience taught me that no WP hosting is perfect. 

I’ve also used GoDaddy in the past. The website builder was okay, uptime was okay and overall it was a decent experience. However, what really ruined it was that eventually my yearly plan ran out - and my website was seemingly lost forever!! Naturally, I was in a panic and looking for answers when the supervisor told me that - hurrah! - they can actually restore it. Hallelujah! However, they also told me that it would cost me money to restore it, which really frustrated me. And it was that which led me to SiteGround."

Now that I'm a manager I have more say so. If you just have a degree from UofP, I'm probably not bringing you in, but if you also have a steady work history along with it, I'll consider bringing you in."

10299,best suitcase lock,"1. Always keep your baggage claim ticket. If the airline loses your bag, they have to pay if you have your ticket. Not having your ticket absolves them of paying.

2. Read the terms. They will not pay for lost electronics, cameras, computers, etc. You have to carry that shit on.
