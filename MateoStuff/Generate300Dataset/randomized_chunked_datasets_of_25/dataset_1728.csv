Tapp tries to catch Zep before he can get to the room. Believing that his wife and daughter are still in danger, Gordon finally saws off his own foot thinking that it is the only way to save his family, while Adam cries out unsuccessfully, trying to tell Dr. Gordon to stop.!<

>!Det. Tapp nearly emerges victorious, but is shot by Zep, who rushes to the washroom and leaves him to die. Free of his shackle after sawing off his foot, Gordon shoots Adam. Very soon after, Zep reaches the washroom and is tackled by Adam, who is injured but still alive and beats Zep to death with the toilet lid. After a tearful goodbye, Gordon leaves, saying he has to get help, or he'll bleed to death.!<

John rises up and tells him the key to his chains is in the bathtub, but had been swept away when Adam first awoke. John has been making people kill themselves to make them learn life lessons, as he himself is bitter from his approaching death from an inoperable brain tumor. Adam is shocked by the moment and John abandons him, turning off the lights and locking him in the room. “Game over,” he says, ending the film with Adam trapped in the pitch-black washroom, screaming into the credits.!<
