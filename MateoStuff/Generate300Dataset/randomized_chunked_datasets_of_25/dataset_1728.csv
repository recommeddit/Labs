55675,best action and adventure novel series,":D  I like the infodumps.

Well, some of them.  But I do have to say, I'm not quite sure why *Snow Crash* is considered to be one of the best sf books ever.  Don't get me wrong; I like it, but I don't think it's quite all that."

Tapp tries to catch Zep before he can get to the room. Believing that his wife and daughter are still in danger, Gordon finally saws off his own foot thinking that it is the only way to save his family, while Adam cries out unsuccessfully, trying to tell Dr. Gordon to stop.!<

After a tearful goodbye, Gordon leaves, saying he has to get help, or he'll bleed to death.!<

>!Adam, however, is still shackled to the wall. He searches Zep’s pockets for a key,!< >!but instead finds another cassette. Zep was manipulated by Jigsaw all along. He was being forced to kidnap Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter, or be killed by a poison coursing through his system.!<

John rises up and tells him the key to his chains is in the bathtub, but had been swept away when Adam first awoke. John has been making people kill themselves to make them learn life lessons, as he himself is bitter from his approaching death from an inoperable brain tumor. Adam is shocked by the moment and John abandons him, turning off the lights and locking him in the room. “Game over,” he says, ending the film with Adam trapped in the pitch-black washroom, screaming into the credits.!<
