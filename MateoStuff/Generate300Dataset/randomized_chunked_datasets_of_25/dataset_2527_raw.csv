"I read the local daily most days. And when I'm in another city, I pick up the daily (or dailies) there. There's just no digital substitution to holding that thing in hand."
"It's a dangerous ass drink for sure. Whenever I'm around someone who orders a Long Island, I'm immediately weary, like ""this person might turn into a monster later tonight."""
"Ys VIII is a pretty solid rpg for me. The others like p5, FF, nier are a given."

"A *shitload* of dish towels.

I decided a couple of years ago that I was going to make a conscious effort to deal with all the minor irritations in my life. First on the list was the fact that I never had a dish towel clean and to hand when I needed one. Boom! Problem solved. That tiny little frustration that I experienced multiple times a day -- wiping up spills, getting something out of the oven, putting a hot tray down on a work surface -- was gone immediately.

So I started branching out to other things. Ever spent more than two minutes looking for a pair of tweezers? Or a corkscrew? Well, they're cheap. Buy multiples! Have them to hand! Get that minor annoyance out of your life!

(Here's where someone invariably points out that I could just always make sure that I put them in the same place and solve the problem that way, but let's be real: have you never accidentally knocked something small down the side of the couch? Or lent it to someone and had them not return it for ages? Or even just moved on to something more important, like when you're using tweezers to pull something gross like a shard of glass out of your foot? Having multiples means that you've got a nice little buffer in case your perfect plan goes astray.)

Embrace the multiple."

"Good Time in a really different way. The stakes are set from the first scene, and only get higher till the credits."
"I'd say Dominion as well,  since the game practically explains itself."
"There's always a possibility that V and MC develop their own products on multiple blockchains as well.  Anyone is free to build on them after all and these guys have a huge headstart with decades of experience, data, and trust to build off of."
I used Hien for like 2-3 months and I really like my hayate otsu so far. Definitely recommend it :)
"Don't be afraid of contractor supply stores. Know what you need, have a good sense of what you're talking about, and you'll get in and out with the best if 'em. Assuming the minimum qty isn't too much you'll definitely save over big boxers. I had heard that you had to have a company account to shop at them, but I've never had an issue paying with a credit card or cash."
"Daniel Radcliffe. 

I'm not a big HP fan, but one of my friends is, so we went to see his show Endgame in London a few months ago, and waited in the lobby after the show ended (which was the equivalent of waiting by the stage door). He came out and spoke to every single person who wanted to talk to him, which was an honestly enormous number of people, for *hours*. Instead of quickly taking a photo and signing a playbill for each person, he showed genuine curiosity about the people he met, asked questions, made conversation, and made everyone feel like they mattered. This was at night after the show had ended, and I'm sure he was tired, yet he was still such a charming and genuinely caring guy to each person. I was a bit blown away. I wasn't much of a Daniel Radcliffe fan before this, but am now."
Glad to hear from someone who has something from them!
"It really depends on what you are using them for. If you are only doing design, I would say that (first of all you should be using H pencils for clean work) you don't need heavy graphite or wax based pencils. That means stay away from Mars Lumograph (the darkest of all pencils) and Faber Castell (better for doing classical drawing). 

If I were you, I would use the Monograph Pencils that come from Tokyo. They are a bit pricier, but they are by far the cleanest 4b and 6b pencils I have ever used. A good rule of thumb for buying supplies is to look for the country of manufacture. Germany, France, and Japan make the bulk of the really good stuff. Holland too I suppose."
"SLO is basically regarded the same as mid tier UCs, at least among the state anyway. I know CSU San Diego aka SDSU is pretty well regarded as well, and it's a little more nationally known (for other reasons but hey name recognition is name recognition).

As far as I know they all have solid programs but they're CSUs, which are geared more towards BS/BA education rather than research/further education, so you might take that into consideration if those implications are important to you. Some of the CSUs are looking to become more like UCs, but it's a slow and small process."
"Agricultural Production or environmental science, we are going to be arguing over food and water when we can't farm like this anymore or live like this anymore because of peak water and peak oil."

"Shutter Island...... really liked the movie.... but you know what I feels would’ve made it better? A double twist. It’s been a while since I’ve seen it, but the twist when it’s revealed he’s an inmate was good, but the final scene where he’s sat on the steps and the doctor comes over and talks to him...... imagine if he winked at the other guy as if to say “got him”.... like he wasn’t actually an inmate, but they’d managed to convince him that he was. I always thought that would’ve been a great ending."
SDC is the best theme park in America period!
