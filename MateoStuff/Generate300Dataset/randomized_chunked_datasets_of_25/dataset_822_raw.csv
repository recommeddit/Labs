"Damn, I nearly ordered a NB10000 this morning for same day Prime delivery, but figured I’d wait to see what you all had to say. Meanwhile you all ordered them and pushed delivery out a week. Maybe NB20000 will come out this week and you’ll wish you hadn’t sniped me. :) 
Thanks for the help, good luck all, see you on the trail. PCT 3/24."

Interesting. Looks like they updated their price match policy may 1.
"What a wonderful trip down memory lane. So many of my favorite shows, some of which I haven’t thought about in some time. Thanks for making this."
[clean warm cotton](http://www.sephora.com/warm-cotton-P179007) gets compliments literally every single day I swear it. from strangers and shit.
"Yep, best part is that the ignorant will practically give them away during trade because they are young and foolish"
In the UK you have to pay for the dentist as soon as you're 19.. Doesnt matter if you're in university or not.
Can you plant something small and not suited to your zone and just don’t replace it when it does?
"Really good list! But I'd add Persona, Cache, Paprika, and Perfect Blue here."
"Disclaimer: I'm a sucker for the Beauty and Beast trope and tortured alpha heroes so most of the books I recommend below reflect that.

"It's more of the same and improved. So if you liked the first one, you'll probably really like Shadow of War."
"That’s awesome. My husband wasn’t ready for college at 18 and went back at 28 to become a teacher, and is in his last semester at a CCC right now. He hasn’t paid a dime for his first two years and has gotten an excellent education and is guaranteed a spot at a CSU and knows is credits will all transfer.  They’re a blessing."

"Cool bonus: Apparently, this trilogy got picked up for a TV series.  Maybe it'll even be good!"
Saxophone. That Baker Street intro *mmmmmmmmmmm*
Spigen Liquid Air all the way!

Would kill for a deal like that :O
"Great review. I think hien and zero are restocking in my country soon. But maybe the hien comes in mid and xsoft only. Really tempted on hien red wine since it looks soooo good paired with white mice. Hope it comes in soft! Questions

* 1. How would the zero soft and hien mid or soft compare to the hyperx furys and control? I have these 2 pad for 3 and 2 years now."
If you live here you're probably suffering from skeptical bias. I've lived in both the UK and the US and there's no major cultural difference when it comes to how easy it is to break into social groups. In fact in the UK things are even more stratified by class and tradition. Materialism in the UK is the same as well.
Some people also use it for the difference in texture when it comes to drawing. I'm torn between getting one or not for my new iPad Pro :(
"I subbed to FEM but I'm torn on how I feel about it. A lot of the courses are really old, and there doesn't seem to be all that much content for how much you pay."
"I have a lot of stuff open on my laptop, from many many browser tabs, python code running, FTP client open (uploading/downloading), sshed into a server, excel, CAD, and I am often making screen recordings which need to be processed and much more.

So I'm not a light user either. Bare in mind that the surface book 2 actually cannot be ran at max usage without draining battery as Microsoft never worked out the math correct. GPU + CPU + screen + everything else... = over 95W power"
"You might consider a USB extender which comes in handy for other things as well.

Then you can just plug it into whatever. Don't wanna sit at your desk for gaming? USB extender. Now you can sit at the couch and use the coffee table instead of your desk and the tv instead of your monitor"
