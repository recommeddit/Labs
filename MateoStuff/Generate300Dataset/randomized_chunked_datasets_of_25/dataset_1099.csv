My wife said I should have just linked a how to play YouTube clip which is amazing in itself that it's a way to learn a game and great for new players"
13176,best gifts for mom,"Yea, I had a hard day at home during my maternity leave and left when my husband got home. I had to buy a dress because I was too postpartum plump to fit into anything still, so I said ""Dinner is in the oven, I've got to go get a dress and I can't take the kids.""  Apparently he didn't listen and just sat at the table waiting for me? He called me an hour later and said ""Have the kids been fed? They seem hungry...""  I had to do a serious count to one hundred to not throw my phone across the dressing room."

Does your algorithm give more points to a lower ranked team beating a higher ranked one? Something along the lines of ELO. If so the losses to Pakistan and NZ might have had a big impact on the rankings."

10391,best suitcase lock,"It's not exactly pay to play, though. As part of the application process you need to give them tons of important documents like your birth certificate, passport, drivers license, finger prints, retinal scan, etc. They verify your past residential, employment, criminal background and credit history. In exchange for giving up your privacy and 100 bucks (or zero if your airline status allows it), you apply for the program. I know a guy who applied, paid, and was denied due to past criminal history (drug possession conviction while in college). It's not as simple as ""pay $100 and skip the lines"".  They also have to accept you and approve you."
