59771,"Oh, there are many of them throughout the decades. It's impossible to say that there's one greatest, because they're all so different: it's like trying to choose the one best painting out of every painting that has ever been made, or the one best TV show or novel or symphony.

Shalimar is considered one of the greats, but I don't care for it: I can see its greatness, but it leaves me a little queasy. I think Mitsouko is one of the greatest scents ever made, but I know people — smart, knowledgeable, experienced-in-perfumery people — who just don't get it. And what's more, Mitsouko has, as have all scents, been reformulated repeatedly over the years, and further, there are perfume and eau de parfum and eau de toilette and eau de cologne versions of the same scent that are all different from one another: how would you choose one version of all these possible versions to the be standard-bearer? Early '90s Mitsouko EDT is the greatest of all Mitsoukos in my limited experience: I never tried anything from the sixties, and I bet that was great, and no doubt the 1919 original was a real barn-burner, but I have tried a nineties EDP which was very good, and the EDP and the parfum from the 2010s I didn't care for at all — too modern, too tinkered-with.

Too many variables is what I'm saying. There can never be one greatest because there are just too many variables.",best perfume
51515,"I have AppleCare+ on my 12 Pro Max, so I don't use a case while at home, but I still have cases for when I'm not.

I'm currently using an Apple Silicone case because I got it as a Christmas gift. I like the feel of it, and would recommend it. It does tend to grab every single piece of lint it comes into contact with though, especially with jeans.

I also have a Caudabe Sheath. These are my overall favorite cases. I used one on my old iPhoneX as well. Great protection and feel with minimum bulk. The feel of a button press is slightly mushy to me, but it's not that bad. I get more satisfactory feedback on a button press from the Apple Silicone case.",best iphone case
