Although being a girl I don't like the fixed ones. You know, for hair washing purposes. I don't wanna wet my hair every time I shower and when I do I wanna be able to get in there from all angles..."

One is ‚ÄúNew To You‚Äù where people post mini-reviews of what they‚Äôve played that month.   
The 2nd is ‚ÄúNew to You A Year Ago‚Äù where the same people revisit their lists from the previous year with updated opinions. It really helps you see what games are just Cult of the New and which ones have real staying power. 

[Here‚Äôs the June ‚Äúa year ago‚Äù list](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/286357/item/8325461?commentid=10347577#comment10347577)

Just wait‚Ä¶.GenCon (in Sept this year) and Essen Spiel (in October) are usually where the biggest number of game releases happen. It‚Äôs fun, but can be overwhelming!"

62222,Best RPG game on PS4,"Odyssey is a good game however, I do not recommend unless you are willing to only play odyssey. The reason I say this is that the game is great but it is ridiculously huge and there are tons to do. But wait isn‚Äôt this a good thing? I‚Äôd say yes *IF* the majority of the side quest content, battles and naval stuff didn‚Äôt feel so mundane and tedious. 

The game kinda goes like this;

Start an island/story quest, then do everything on said island/land including exploration, side quests, and the story quest up to and including overthrowing the leader and fighting the battle. Then move to next land/island and repeat. 

The story is good but the way the game level gates it is not. Unfortunately if you don‚Äôt get the exp boost out of the cash shop you will be barred from progressing naturally through the story and will find yourself doing all the side stuff just to get to the next level requirement. I am NOT saying this is a bad thing or that the game is less enjoyable, what I am saying is that by the time I was level 30ish I really just wanted to complete the main story and move on to other games so I got the booster and did just that.

They crafted a magnificent world and my god is breathtaking at times. I just felt like the game was 60%filler and 40% meaningful story/adventure. With the season pass there is all kinds of new content and stories, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to go back to them yet but I recommend getting the season pass if you get it, it goes on sale a lot. 

Hope this helps!"
69298,best major to study in college,"It's hard to get into ""real"" engineering. At the larger companies the people with seniority get to do most of the fun stuff, the new employees get to do all the (for lack of a better term) bitch work like filling out spreadsheets.

I know people that work small companies making significantly less just so they can do something that's hands on and interesting. It'll probably pay off in the long run, they'll be qualified to do consulting before anyone."

61946,Best RPG game on PS4,"I absolutely loved playing it, even had full Excel sheets with fusions and learned skills.  I had planned my team out for endgame, and made it to November, and then I got distracted.  Needed a break (after 120 hours, I was getting burned out), and then I never went back to it.  

I had gotten the PS3 version, because I didn't think I'd ever get a PS4, but now that I do have one, I really don't want to haul the old system back out just to play one or two games.  On the other hand, not too enthused about buying P5 on the new console and starting from scratch, either."
