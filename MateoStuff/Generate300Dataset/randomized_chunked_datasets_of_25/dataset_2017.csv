32642,best vacation resort,"I travel a lot, and often on a budget. I have always looked at the bad reviews (3 or less out of 5). Look for consistency in complaints (same thing repeated) and see if they are complaints about things you would care about. An example is that at one resort that we were looking at the consistent complaints were that the bartenders didn't know how to mix good fancy tropical drinks. We drink jack and coke and other simple mixed drinks, I could care less about the fancy umbrella laden ones. Another place complained about lack of cleanliness in the rooms ... We are neat freak germaphobes, so that was a big NOPE!

It takes some time, but it Is usually worth it, especially for a honeymoon (congrats!)."

66051,best college in california,"To counter your point, how many good people have come out of Harvard? I think a better way to put it is that the social elite go to Harvard, which gives them access to more positions of power, and more exposure to those already in power.

Quick edit: I do agree on your opinion of those people though"
