I think he might kill me if I get a mug because he says we have too many. I like collecting them.

8891,best toothpaste,"Baking soda is not abrasive to tooth enamel, but is abrasive to a lot of the surface contamination you want to remove when you brush, so it's a fairly good in-between texture for brushing.  Another good thing about it is that it raises the pH in your mouth, which helps neutralize acidic etching of tooth enamel.

note:  I actually worked in the R&D lab that developed a popular baking soda tooth paste."

55819,best action and adventure movie,"Not trying to be a pedantic a-hole and I didn't downvote you, but these strike me as almost strictly ""action"" without the ""adventure"" aspect. When I think of adventure I think of a bigger quest like Indy, LOTR, The Mummy, etc."

30157,best Mexican war to study,"Because Santa Ana just ‚ÄúSanta Ana‚Äôd.‚Äù  

If he had listened to his generals, or at least been a little less of an arrogant asshat, he *would* have steam-rolled over the Texians. 

But he felt he knew best, and made a ton of stupid decisions while fighting the rebels.  

He was also more accustomed to the rebellions in Mexicans states in southern part of Mexico.  Those rebellions weren‚Äôt very well organized, and *way* more poorly armed than the Texians were.  

My *cat* could have probably led the Mexicans to victory in those states.   

Texians, on the other hand, were better armed, had some combat experience, and were comparatively well-organized.  

Santa Ana could have still crushed the Texians, of course.  But he picked a lot of tactics that he thought were ‚Äúcute‚Äù but not very sound in the situation he was in."

28506,best breakfast foods,"There's an air bubble inside the egg at the top or bottom.  Wack the egg gently on the counter to crack the top- you can do both sides if you want.  When you find the air bubble, start peeling the egg under cool water coming from a faucet."
