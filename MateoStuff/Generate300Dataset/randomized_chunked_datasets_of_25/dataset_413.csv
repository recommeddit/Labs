40951,"I know nothing about symphonic/classical percussion, so I do wonder how hard the repertoire is  for that as compared to other styles/genres of drumming. I guess in the symphonic world, I think of people playing a single percussion instrument more than a kit of multiple things at once. And there’s less syncopation than you would generally have for jazz, funk, or Latin percussion. So I wonder if the real difficult percussion stuff is found outside of the orchestra world.

I could be way off base, of course. It’s just that the first image that comes to mind of a percussionist in a symphonic orchestra is someone banging a gong, and that can’t be *too* hard.",best instrument to play
