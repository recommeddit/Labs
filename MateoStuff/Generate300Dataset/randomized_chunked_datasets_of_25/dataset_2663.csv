32296,"Lmao I have so many stories and honestly I want to write a memoir about it.

We legit had someone once break into the archive room and steal everyoneâ€™s credit card details. Nobody noticed until like a month later. Was a shit show.

Iâ€™ve had to deal with people throwing the furniture off balconies and throw on to other guests cars.

Sadly a lot of DV incidents. Hospitalisations. People killing themselves. Undercover cops looking at CCTV for high end criminals?

And donâ€™t even get me started on how â€˜cleanâ€™ those rooms are. Your $1000/night does not reflect those standards. They still wash them tea cups in the bathroom sink or the bath tub.

Lastly, Iâ€™m an Australian and was working in the US for a while in this fancy 5 star resort (front line position working holiday) and what management really didnâ€™t want you to know is how little they paid us. 
At home I could survive on our Australian minimum wage - but had no chance in the US of surviving on theirs (we werenâ€™t allowed to accept tips at this particular company ðŸ™„)

Thereâ€™s a reason for high turnover in hospitality I guess",best hotel to live in

First go download [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Next grab the latest version of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Install both and sign up for a free account on [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com)

Grab yourself cygwin/mysysgit or similar. You are going to need git eventually and you need an openssh client. Install one of those.

Start > Run > cmd

    cd %userprofile% #This should drop you into your home directory.

    mkdir $dirName 

This can be anything you want. I call mine vProj.

    vagrant init hashicorp/precise64 

This is going to create a file called Vagrantfile in the directory you are in when you call the command. This file is what Vagrant is going to use to build a box.

    vagrant up

Vagrant is now going to go out to the internet and download an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit vagrant box and use vBox to provision it.

    vagrant ssh

You are now in your very own Ubuntu 12.04 Virtual Box. :) You don't like it? vagrant destroy will get rid of it. vagrant up again will rebuild it. vagrant halt stops it. Their are plenty of base boxes on the vagrant cloud. Companies like puppet even put their own boxes online for devs to use. The beauty is that you didn't have to open vBox one time. You didn't have to play with the network settings or setup some weird bridge. Vagrant does it all for you. You can, of course, open vBox and run it as normal but really you don't need to.

As for books.
