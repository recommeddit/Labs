11195,best backpack for college,I have been rocking out my kelty since starting undergrad in 2003 and it's been great
68009,best science fiction novel,"OP also refers to it as ""perhaps his best known work"".  Putting aside personal favorites, my understanding is that *Stranger in a Strange Land* is, and has always been, Heinlein's most famous (""best-known"") book, by far.  Maybe I'm old, but have perceptions of his work changed *that* much?  Or has it just been the impact of the *Starship Troopers* movie?"

65578,best phone service company,"That’s interesting! Didn’t know, thanks for sharing. I guess I wasn’t affected."
25817,best cricket teams of all time,"I thought about Lloyd. Probably should have mentioned him. Mark Waugh was probably a stretch. In all fairness I was born in 1990 so my knowledge of the Windies team is lore and highlights based. Where the 00s Australians hit their peak while I was getting into cricket, as an Australian, so they take a high spot in my mind.

But I still stand by that overall point that Australia was absurdly dominant batting and dominant bowling where Windies were absurdly dominant bowling and batting that was good, anchored by Viv."

30211,best Mexican war to study,"Believe it or not our history classes are very honest to us about our fucked up history, we are not North Korea"
23275,best car racing video game,"I mainly play Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 although the loading screens are a bit long and therefor for car games I stick to BeamNG , which I completely recommend. The game started out in 2012 although since then it's came a long way. The game is a realistic car crash simulator although you can free roam, do made up scenarios, 4x4, do a $1000 car challenge and much more. Atleast look into it :)"

66954,best soccer team in the world,"Not particularly successful ? Lol France got third place in 58, and was excellent during the 80' and Platini generation, with an Euro and a fourth place after the bullshit game against Germany."
73744,best matte screen protector for ipad,"After rereading what I wrote, I kinda feel like I didn’t give the paperlike a high enough praise. I actually *really* like the feel of it, so much so that I don’t really care what it does to the way my screen looks.

Since you’ve tried both iCarez and the Paperlike, do you think that there is a difference in the way the pencil feels on them? I wanted to get iCarez at first because that’s what most people have been using, but I couldn’t easily get it here in the UK."
3478,best college for research,">It offers stronger undergrad education

That feels pretty subjective, no? And you're comparing a 7% acceptance rate to a 9% acceptance rate. Not to mention acceptance rate is a wack way to measure prestige, generally -- and you say just as much in one of your comments here! There's no consistency lmao"

From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. Before 1974, the Nobel Prize was also awarded posthumously to Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931)."
6960,best iPhone,"Best for it’s time either the original iPhone  ( game changing ) or the iPhone 4 ( better design imo and display than anything else at the time ).

Worst... I’d say iPhone 7 due to sub par battery life even when it was new, it became dire after a year or so."
