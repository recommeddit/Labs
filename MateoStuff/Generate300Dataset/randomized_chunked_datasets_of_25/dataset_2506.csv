17932,best Kardashian,"I go through phases too. Khloe reminded me a lot of my sister and I love her humor, so she used to be my favorite. I still like her, but I think nowadays, I'm starting to like Kim the most. I also bounced between liking Kendall too, but I think what annoyed me was seeing how mean and critical she is to Kylie.

But back to Kim: I think all her hard work is paying off, and it shows. I love her strong work ethic and how professional she is. She's the type of woman who knows what she wants, and works towards making that happen. Obviously she's fortunate to have the resources, but still. She really matured throughout the years, and I think there's a reason why Khloe is starting to gravitate more towards that."

51513,best iphone case,Thanks for those two recommendations :)
56021,best action and adventure movie,"The ending to AI is actually enormously sad, but it's definitely hard to parse as that on an initial viewing. 

Put it simply, all of humanity is dead, David is trapped by his programming into 'loving' somebody who stopped existing long ago, and so the only merciful choice available to his distant descendants is to euthanize him. It's wrapped in sentimentality to trick David, but it's a dark ending by any fair standard.

(And it's probably one of Spielberg's best films.)"
39842,best Chrome extensions,"Funny story about the cloud to butt extension. One day at work I received a client list from a third party, when I was parsing the list I got a bunch of failed email addresses, all ending in `@ibutt.com`. Turns out the third party I got this from copied and pasted from their browser which had the cloud to butt extension installed thus turning all of the `@icloud.com` to `@ibutt.com`.

To this day both of our respective companies use that as a cautionary tale to new employees: we tell everyone to always double check third party provided files; they tell everyone to be cognisant of what browser extensions are installed."

16798,best pet for toddlers,"Honestly, it depends on the cat.

Some cats are ""boring"" or ""decorative"" - depending on which way you look at it! They just enjoy sleeping in several spots for most of the time.

Other cats are interactive, animated and curious. These are the clowns, the adventure-seekers and the ones with ""character"".

I've had and known both types and currently have one of each. My ""interactive"" cat comes on walks with me and will come when I call her. 

Having said that and seen your (wife's) reason further down for wanting an animal:

> She hates seeing our child play alone...

Really, I don't think an animal is the answer to this. I agree with /u/je_taime's suggestions and add, that one of the beauties of being an only child is we learn to entertain ourselves and not need constant company."

3571,best college for research,"The Hidden Ivies by Howard Greene has pretty good summaries of all the top schools, with info on school goals and advantages and standout majors/programs"
30054,best money managing app,"I use Wallet by BudgetBakers. 

Pros:

\- You can add up to three accounts (ex: cash on-hand, money in the bank, money in your coin bank). 

\- Has labels in your income and expenses so you can track specific income and expenses (ex: food and drinks, transportation)

\- Has a pie chart of the breakdown of your income and expenses according to the labels you set

\- Gives you a rough percentage of the change in your spending. For example, the graph shows ""-21%"" in red font when your expenses for the last 7 days went down by 21%

\- Has options where you can set a goal

\- Helps you track planned payments

\- Helps you track your debts and money people loaned from you

\- Has a feature where you rate whether a certain expense is ""worth it"" or ""not worth it""

Cons:

\- You have to pay for certain features like if you want to add more accounts or sync a certain account to your bank. You also need to upgrade to premium if you want to change the colors of labels, etc. (di naman sobrang laking con, pero ayun may limitations kung hindi premium). 

\- Not really good for tracking expenses in your business. App is mostly for personal and family budget"
30975,best country to live in,"Arizona and New Mexico have some of the worst education systems in the country. 

Phoenix is hot as fuck.

If you don't live in a major city (Phoenix, Flagstaff, ABQ, Santa Fe, Las Cruces), you're probably in a pretty small town about an hour from the nearest town. I guess some people would like that, though.

That being said, I have family in NM and it's a gorgeous place."
71626,best movies with a cool twist,"Primer has a bit of a twist in it, aside from the timeline. I think it's pretty good. And outside of the internet, no one really knows about it. 

This might be more mainstream than you're looking for, but Unbreakable has a pretty good twist in in. I often cite it as M. Night Shyamalan's greatest film, better than The Sixth Sense. Probably because I like superheroes."
38609,best newspapers to read,"none, is it bad?"
37999,best Marvel movie,"I wish more people would understand that we do understand, but we also believe that in the aggregate, a binary scoring system is also a valid way to rate a film. Is it the best? Maybe, maybe not, but it is a valid way to measure something."
36078,best alcoholic drink,"Definitely my favorite cocktail. Very classy, especially when correctly served In a champagne flute. After shaking and pouring then add the champagne, though. Another thing I like doing is to use less simple syrup, use a martini glass and coat the rim in sugar. Makes it lighter for me. Kinda loses the classy appeal, but gains a fun appeal. 
Edit: I accidentally a word"
56689,best desktop monitor,"Anyone have any recommendations for a monitor around $200? I can stretch the budget up to $250 if necessary. I would prefer IPS, but I could probably be convinced to go for TN if its a good panel. A higher refresh rate would be great but I don't know whats possible in my budget. I would like 1080p 23-24""."

72028,best movies with a cool twist,"It's a great twist becaus it not only comes out of left field and is a ""holy shit"" moment, but it also enhances the story and gives the protagonist more depth."
