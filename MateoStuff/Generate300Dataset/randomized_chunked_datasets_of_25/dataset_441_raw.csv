"My guess is you're a woman in her 20s. You have a taste for classic and fresh florals, nothing too loud but you do like some sweeter, bolder scents too. You have a classic sense of style, and I'd guess your hobbies may include baking, reading, and playing video games."

"I went to this designer sample sale in my office building once and there were some crazy good deals - shoes that were maybe anywhere from £300 to £1000 were as little as £20. I was on FaceTime to my mom to show her some sneakers that I knew she'd like, so I bought them for her. Then, about two hours later, they announced this sudden 'flash sale' - everything HAD to go, so they reduced the price of EVERYTHING to £10. It was total madness, but I ended up finding a pair of black biker boots I hadn't seen earlier with butterflies and flowers on them that I knew she'd love. I didn't tell her a thing.

Cut to maybe two weeks later and I'm visiting home. I hand her the sneakers, but then tell her to close her eyes because I have a surprise. She did and she clasped her hands, thinking it was going to be something small. Well, I plopped these large biker boots in her hands, she opened her eyes, and immediately burst in to tears and started clutching at them as if they were a baby and someone was going to steal them! Now, every time she puts them on, her face is glowing because they're her favourite thing I've gotten her, and people always compliment her on them, so she loves getting to name drop the brand.

Fun fact - I price checked them later on, and they retailed for £1500. Steal of the century."

"Biology, unless you want to go to med/pharm/vet school or graduate school. A BS in Biology won't get you very far and you'll max out in earning potential early on. A lot of bio majors go back for their MS or PhD because they're stuck at a low pay scale.  If you already know that's what you want to do, you're fine. Make sure you do a BS and not a BA though."
