However there is a twist.  Zinc is very interactive with the sense of smell and taste.  In some cases, people are afflicted with a horrible malady so that everything they smell or taste is like garbage, but this can sometimes be corrected with zinc, restoring smell and taste to normal.

But like those who lost their sense of smell, too much zinc can be bad.

And yet with another twist, a common medical problem today is too much copper in the system; which can be corrected by taking zinc.",best medicine for a cold

8421,"Yep. I’m american and always pick up sensodyne outside the USA. It has a compound called novamin in it. It’s the fucking BOMB. 

FDA hasn’t approved it because they want more proof of the “repair” aspect in the title but no one else cares. Stuff is great. I travel outside the USA enough to make sure I always have enough but it’s also like $6-7 on amazon/eBay. 

Look for sensodyne repair and protect with Novamin.",best toothpaste

67569,"I think it's really a question of 'what level' the library should work on. If you're just interested in sending raw HTTP requests and responses, you probably should be using fetch.

A higher level lib might have a better understanding of the actual meaning of certain HTTP responses, for example:

* Provide auhtentication support
* Retry automatically when receiving a Retry-After header on a 503 or 429.
* Follow redirects transparently
* Provide a cache and serve from cache

That said, any exceptions thrown could still provide access to the response by providing a response property on the error object.

It could be argued that a true HTTP client understands more about http than just plumbing request and response objects, but whether they _should_, really depends on design goals.

I would really like to see a middleware-type ecosystem that adds opt-in functionality to fetch, so we can pick and choose which features we're interested in.",axios alternatives reddit

If you want to ignore those areas, suggesting that it's impossible to reason about them, that's scientism.  We *do* still have ways to reason about them, and ignoring an issue rarely helps.

The proper approach is to recognize that specific areas are [outside the remit of hard science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science#Defining_science), continue on as best we can with the tools that are available, and acknowledge that the conclusions won't be as rigorous as the hard sciences but we did the best we could.",best newspapers to read

I shop at both of them regularly and even though Lowes is slightly more expensive, I would much rather shop there than The Home Depot. The only thing I do not like about Lowes is how they setup their hand tools in the front of the store but you have to walk through a maze to get in and out of that section. I'm sure they are doing this to prevent theft but it's a little overkill for me.",best home improvement store
