Dillinger should be at the top holy shit. Exclusively listen to them and Dangers at the gym.
"So I was on vacation in Atlantis, Bahamas. And me and my cousin were at the teen club(cut me some slack, we were 16 and met ladies) when I hear kids freaking out.

The twins from Suite Life of Zach and Cody were there for a publicity thing and came to the club that night. There was an area in this club with video games and at one point they both sat down to play some Super Smash Bros. Melee with a large Bahamian guy hovering over them. I noticed an extra controller that no one went for because they were so enthralled and figured, ""what the hell...""

They both came at me, ignoring each other. It was a stock match and I ended up taking one twin out while losing to the other.

All in all, contrary to the show, the douchey one on screen was really nice and chill. The nice one onscreen was a jerkoff to people."
"Mint is the most common. Yes there are ads, but I've never personally felt there's enough to bother me."
Oh it will definitely grab everything in your pocket. If you wear a lot of jeans you'll be getting all the lint.
Unless money falls out. It just means I have to read something.
".... Not a single book suggested on here has actually been a romance novel. Much as I love The Time Traveler's Wife and many of the classic novels people have suggested here.

If your friend likes to read ""romance novels"" she'd probably be most comfortable with an actual book from that genre!  She'd also be annoyed that you characterized it as ""run of the mill"" and ""cliche"".  Romance novels, like a sonnet, adhere to a stricter structure than most novels but that doesn't make their repetitive patterns a cliche. 

That said, I'd go with something by Nora Roberts (she's the biggie for a reason) and if you can find one of them, Honest Illusions and Sweet Revenge are two of her best stand alone novels.

She might also like something a little more ""chic-lit""-y, in which case I'd suggest anything by Marian Keyes or a fantastic novel called Bridget Jones Diary. But once again, those are not romance novels in the most traditional sense of the word, and will give you a  different experience.

Edit: Outlander, mentioned below, is the closest thing here to an actual romance novel, although as the suggester said, it spreads out into a series that is clearly just historical. It's also really long so if your friend isn't much of a brain she might be intimidated. If she can handle it though, Jamie and Claire will probably be some of the best book friends she'll ever make!"

Fuckin worst flavor. Almost as bad as tiger but different strokes for different folks...
In Brazil: Usually a slice of bread with butter or some other topping and lots of coffee.
That album will always sound fresh as hell. Hard to believe that it came out 14 years ago. It was ahead of it's time production wise.
Just make sure it’s MFI.
Thanks.
uruguay should be 4th or 5th
How about a month or two during the summer?
[Kirkland Signature](https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-M38-Black-Polarized-Sunglasses.product.100394883.html) sunnies. Looks like they only have aviator style sunglasses this year? But a few years back they had a wayfarer style option that I bought back in 2013 and they're pristine (save from a small twist from me just tossing them into a bag without the case while drunk). Definitely worth considering if you have a Costco membership.
Debating on getting a third party clear case or leather again...

The Game is one of my favourite movies. Watching it the 2nd time is almost better than the first.

"didn’t even know installer existed for ios12/a12. downloaded. omg it’s great!!! my only gripe is it not letting me use repos that say “not compatible with your device” when i know it is. installer is everything that sileo should’ve been, as they said it has no web views. that’s my biggest concern and they fixed it"

"This holds true for anything, computer related or otherwise. More importantly, achieving a balance between price-is-no-object and acceptable quality will give you a great experience without having to waste excessive amounts of money on products that really do not give you much benefit if any over less expensive, but high quality parts. You could be a millionaire, but there's still no reason to waste money. In fact, millionaires (barring lottery winners) generally got that way by being frugal even when buying high quality items.

My cousin wasted over $5000 on a WTFPWNBBQ etc. etc. PC years ago, while I spent under $2300 (both in Canadian currency) and got much better performance in every way, just by carefully selecting each and every component for quality gaming (and non-gaming, primarily Maya) performance at a reasonable price."
"Left Hand of Darkness -Ursula Le Guin
Stalker Roadside Piknik - Arkadi and Boris Strugatski
Solaris - Stanislav Lem
A Fire Upon the Deep - Vernor Vinge
Blindsight - Peter Watts

Le Guin is a must read for any sci fi fan. Stalker and Solaris on the other hand are the classics of Soviet/Easter Block sci fi. A Fire Upon the Deep is one of the best space operas ever and Blindsight is one hell of a weird book."
