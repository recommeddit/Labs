45926,best trick or treating candy,"> and one with shitty generic crap like unlabeled hard candy and knockoff stale chocolates for teenagers who go around without costumes to be sad and stop stealing the fun from the children.

Balmer's chocolate candy, anyone? I always hated receiving those bitter, mealy, foil-covered pumpkin chocolates with the crunch things inside. Yeah, fuck that chocolate."

32753,best vacation resort,"I would like to relax but a bit more lively atmosphere wouldn't be horrible as we are going with friends. Cost is important though, I found that a dozen of the all-inclusive adult only places are 1900 or less for 4 days. Being such a cheap trip I guess giving somewhere a shot is a bit easier in that regard so I shouldn't stress. This isn't super fun though, figured it would be. lol"

10213,best pencil for drawing,"1. Pencil

2. Paper.

My art teacher once said ""An artist is only as good as his tools."" She was an idiot. Seriously, you don't need to go spend money on tons of crap, it wont make you a better artist. And it certainly does not help beginners, it just makes it seem like there's more to learn. Get good with your regular pencil. Then maybe get one different weight pencil and try it out, depending out what you think you need. You don't need to go buy 24 different weights, all that will happen is that you'll try them once and have no idea when to use them. Only I would actually suggest is one of those grey claylike erasers, those make erasing big things easier, are nicer to the paper and last longer than solid erasers. But even that's not needed. What IS needed is time and practice and sticking with it. Good luck!"
