16249,best sunglasses for fashion,"I love my Kent Wang sunglasses. Iâ€™ve had probably half a dozen pairs by now. I think theyâ€™re around 50 bucks, constructed with high quality acetate frames, great polarized lenses, and durable spring-relief hinges. Iâ€™m consistently impressed by the great quality, considering that I know what people are paying for (IMO inferior quality) raybans, etc"
7530,best laptop for general use,"I've researched the list of laptops below in hopes of finding a good gaming laptop. However, I always seem to just find all of the negative comments. The only conclusion I could think to come to is these are all terrible, but I donâ€™t think thats the case. 

Looking for some help trying to find a good gaming laptop. Budget is $2500, if the laptop is not maxed for specs I would like it to be upgradable. Also, I know nothing about AMD, but willing to go that route. Any assistance would be appreciated.

72571,best keyboard switches,"It's totally personal preference. It seems like a lot of ""pros"" use reds, and maybe they're slightly better but *to me* they don't really feel hugely different than rubber domes. I only tried them for about five minutes but I found them totally nondescript.

Blues are my favorite to type because of the sound... but they're loud enough that honestly I get self conscious using blues in a room where there are other people trying to do things that involve their ears.

So brown are probably my favorite overall."

64743,Best Nike running shoes,"In some ways those companies are in the cutting edge of technology. ""Foam"" technology is the latest trend and it really took off under Adidas and now Nike has become the gold standard. 

I've never bought either brands because of personal comfort, but I definitely think every other shoe company is trying to keep up."

33090,best energy drink,"I'm a big fan of kombucha (Synergy is a good brand).  It's a little pricey but it's easy to make yourself if you can get your hands on a SCOBY... and fun.

It's refreshing and energizing without all the other crap that's usually in energy drinks.  It's actually supposed to be good for you."

I have been drawing pretty happily so far with my primitive tools, the only thing that really frustrated me was the lack of contrast when shading with it. But I think I will stick with what I have and maybe buy a few cheap extras. Thanks for the encouragement! :)"
