51526,best iphone case,Didn't it yellow after a while?  Almost every review of a clear case that isn't a rigid case talks about it yellowing or browning after a couple months.

32460,best vacation resort,"You’re aware trip advisor is literally peoples opinions of them...

Fml"
68745,best science fiction novel,"I like both hard science fiction, provocative sci-fi and some of the great classics, so here's my list: **Dune**, **1984**, **Neuromancer**, **Ender's Game**, **The Time Machine**, **Fahrenheit 451**, **Stranger in a Strange Land**, **Snow Crash**, **Slaughterhouse 5** and **A Wrinkle in Time**. I'd add **Frankenstein** due to its profound brilliance and depth, but is it science fiction?

Here's a second list too; non-English language sci-fi that's also excellent: **20,000 Leagues Under the Sea**, **All You Need is Kill**, **The Three-Body Problem**, **Battle Royale**, **The Windup Girl** and **Solaris**."
43226,best detective show,"Recently found 'Der Pass' on nowtv / sky atlantic and it's fantastic. the rest have been mentioned... both seasons of the sinner, mindhunter (2nd season out tomorrow), the killing, manhunt: unabomber, enjoy."
19784,best workout music,Who cares about hip hop just listen to nier's ost.
31019,best country to live in,Oh thanks for your genuine concern. I have a few lifelong friends but in different countries.
4689,best home improvement store,Hardly worth $1.50 to figure that out though.  At least for me.
33798,best Pokemon game,"Rse Hoenn was my absolute favorite. It felt like a true game. It was a lot of fun. Loved the Pokémon and it was my favorite map. I loved the desert, the ash area and the sea routes. I miss having complex sea routes to explore. Exploring the ocean floor was so cool. Contests and secret bases were also a lot of fun. Also think it had the best overall story, best puzzles and best set of legendaries. 


I think SwSh were the worst. Played more like a simulator than a game. More expensive plus dlc that should already been in the game. zero story for the first 95% of the game. Climax was a flop. No interesting routes to navigate. They were all really linear. Legendaries were lame. Hated the rival. They cut a lot of my favorites"
66548,best soccer team in the world,I think it makes it even worse knowing Australia only misses this list by one place. At least if we’d been further off I wouldn’t have gotten my hopes up.
41242,best instrument to play,There's just something about that instrument when an orchestra is playing and then they have a solo part.
36151,best alcoholic drink,"The Negroni.
Equal parts gin, campari, and sweet vermouth chilled and served up with an orange rind."
38247,best newspapers to read,"""There ain't nothing in the middle of the road except yellow lines and dead armadillos."" -Molly Ivins"
69453,best major to study in college,duh it's biology. it's like the art major of the science world.
38112,best Marvel movie,The lack of infinity war and guardians 2 instead of Endgame and maybe Strange is kinda disturbing.
41987,movies like Inception,"Been planning on reading the book for like the last 2 years, but yes I meant the movie, I'm sure the book goes much deeper than the film ever could though."
7176,best iPhone,They did slow phones without notifying the user. It’s just unprovable that the motive was to sell more phones.
47742,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"I love my TI-84 Plus CE. I also own a regular TI-84 Plus, and I'd gladly take the CE over it, even though it costs marginally more. It doesn't cost much more, but it's significantly slimmer, easier to read, and is rechargeable with a battery indicator so I never have to worry about it dying during an important exam.

However, the Nspire is certainly the more powerful calculator, and it's about the same cost."
39527,best podcast for biologists,"Ologies is amazing! It’s all science, but there’s a lot of biology. I have a PhD in biology and I still learn a lot."
43576,best items under $100,"I got one! Although I have never been in an accident before *knock on wood*, the peace of mind that it gives me to know that I have backup evidence or anything of that sort for future issues is calming. Best 50 bucks spent in the last 30 days."
58061,best cologne,Bring a little sack of coffee to clear the nose pallette. You sniff the coffee in-between scents and you don't get headaches after.
30108,best Mexican war to study,I’m from the Midwest and know about it only because my dad is a history buff. I don’t think we ever learned about it in school
20492,best workout music,Anything off Evil Empire for that matter.
