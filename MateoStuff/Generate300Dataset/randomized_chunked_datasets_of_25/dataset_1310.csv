6965,best iPhone,"The whole “battery gate” issue is way overblown. Apple introduced that feature in iOS 10 because they were getting increased reports of older iPhone batteries failing in some manner. Instead of having to issue a mass recall (which would have cost Apple hundreds of millions of dollars and potentially damaged their brand) Apple instead opted to fix the issue through software by throttling older iPhones down to the point where the power issues were resolved and the phones were still more than useable. After blowback, Apple gave users the ability to flip a switch and turn this feature off. I personally think it was a smart move by Apple in order for them to avoid a Note 7 disaster on a potentially larger scale.

Or, we can go with the oft repeated theory that Apple is intentionally trying to force people to upgrade their phones. Personally, one of these sounds plausible while the others sounds more like a bunch of disgruntled customers coming up with their own ideas."
41286,best instrument to play,"Sorry, but no. This is not an instrument. That's like saying my mouse is the best sounding instrument because I can click play on a video."
23825,best car racing video game,"There is a huge spectrum of racing ""games"". The question is, do you want something designed primarily to be fun and with lots of game-elements (we'll call this the Mario Kart side of the spectrum) or do you want a serious business tire traction simulator that is as difficult to learn as actual racing realistically is, involving possibly years of not-always-fun practice and developing your skills to master.

Something like the classic console franchises of Gran Turismo or Forza falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, and unfortunately there aren't a lot of choices on PC for that middle-ground. Most of the PC options lean quite heavily towards one end of the fun-vs-serious spectrum or the other. There are lots of games attempting to be fun crazy racing games with no basis in reality, and there are lots of games attempting to be a complete replacement for reality with no room for anything that a casual player would consider ""fun"".

Which is too bad, because the middle of the spectrum is my favorite part. It is sadly underrepresented on PC."
41858,movies like Inception,"Movies by Shane Carruth:
- Primer
- Upstream Color

Much smaller productions than Inception, but both are amazing. Fun fact, Shane Carruth not only directed these, but also produced, wrote, composed, and acted in them. The man is impressive."
23623,best car racing video game,"NFS Heat is actually pretty great. The game combines the risk & reward system of NFS Rivals and the customization of NFS 2015.

During day time, you do regular ""semi legal"" street races. The cops aren't after you, the races are mostly down to pure racing skill, even traffic is blocked during the racing. 

During night time, you do fully illegal street races. The traffic is active and cops can start chasing you mid race any time. And the chase continues even after finishing the race. The more you get chased the higher your earnings multiplier goes, so staying out long and doing a lot of races nets you massive rewards. However, if you get busted by the cops, you lose all your multiplier. 

The customization is really the best of any racing game today, especially in terms of visuals. Some cars can be customized more, others less (as expected you can't really rice a ferrari) and the game has a really nice selection of cars. 

I think the game is rather well balanced, cops are really tough at the start and you will be struggling to lose them, but as you progress, they get progressively easier to lose and by the endgame you will be out racing with max heat and not care all that much about the cops. If anything, I think the game gets too easy past the halfway point. But yeah, it's pretty tough at the start. 

NFS Heat keeps the classic ""from zero to hero"" progression. If you are looking for a different kind of progression, then Forza horizon 4 is pretty amazing. It's easily the best driving game since... Forza horizon 3. But as far as visual customization goes it's pretty basic compared to NFS, although keep in mind that Forza has like 5x more cars and also has a cockpit view and I'd say generally better physics. The progression in Horizon games isn't linear, after the initial 2-3 hour long intro you can practically choose what car class you want each race to be, and you get spoiled with rewards - Horizon games are primarily wanting to be your friend and let you play at your own pace. They can absolutely be challenging if you like, but also very easy going."
52799,best hiphop album,I haven't heard too many new artists just because I am not a big fan of what i have heard. I do however think Joyner Lucas is dope. So is Tory Lanes. And i was pleasantly surprised by xxxtenation's album.

7673,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I'd say go for the ASUS Zenbook 14 on my list. It provides a good balance between performance, battery life, and weight. It should be fine for those games.

26903,best board games,"So essentially, because you don't like the games in the top 10, there has to be some conspiracy as to why they are there.

Even though the number 1 and 2 game, completely shatter your entire theory.

Ok."

All I can tell them is: ""My kids gave me this"" and then if they don't understand screw them.

69669,best major to study in college,"It's in part an effect of the Protestant Reformation. At the time, a lot of people opposed to the Catholic church complained that ministers were not educated: barely knowing latin, not being educated in theology, some of them not even having actually read the Bible. They felt that those qualities made it so that they just did whatever more educated higher ups in the church told them to and didn't offer true religious services. Once the Reformation got going and the Catholic church figured out that there were significant problems, the Catholic counter-reformation took measures to correct them with things like establishing more seminaries and making it so that some random guy couldn't be ordained in an afternoon and making it so that priests became some of the most educated people in Europe at the time."
