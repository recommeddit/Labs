"Don’t have a link but it’s the dell s2716dg. My friend just picked it up at Best Buy for $380. I own one personally and it’s very good, especially if you happen to buy the later revisions."
"He shushed you? 
He raped him."
"This is anecdotal but the few women in my CS classes were much better programmers than the average dude. Do you feel like people expected less from you? Curious because I have a little sister who I'm encouraging to go into programming, any advice?"

"You may be confusing PubMed and PubMed Central. PMC does have the accepted version of manuscripts (not copyedited or typeset) available depending on the funding body (NIH for example) but there is usually a 12 month embargo before they are accessible as you said.

Many would also be surprised how many errors are caught during copyediting/typesetting. In addition, some authors blatantly reprint figures from other sources without obtaining permission from the original copyright holder or get proper patient release forms for their patients in figures, which are just some of the additional functions having a publisher serves."
"My Ray-Bans, Carbon Fibre Tech, are really well made. Yes, it was a large investment. But because of that, I'm taking actual care of them and they're going to last me a while (hopefully more than 20 years). Plus they come with a lifetime for the glasses waranty, as long as the frame still says Ray-Ban on it, they'll replace my pair for a new one."
"Definitely -- Downpour.com offers a very similar service, complete with smartphone apps, etc. and is DRM free."
Absolutely Sony blows Bose out of the water
Please remove this or cut down on the spoilers. It isn’t fair to someone who hasn’t seen this great series. Wouldn’t want to ruin it for anyone.
I got a Xiaomi 20k for \~25€. 330g. Quickcharge 3.0 both ways.

"I drove a P100D. It was a riot in a straight line but felt like a Toyota Camry in the corners.  Not terrible, but not exactly a track weapon either."
"Production in Hip Hop is more or less the creation of the music, usually just the beat.

Mixing has to do with a lot of different things, or at least it can. After Kanye records all the synths, strings, vocals, beats, xylophones and whatever, they need to fit together. You can't just use the raw recorded tracks, you need to change the relative volume levels, you need to change the frequencies within them, you need to change the panning, the effects, the phasing, and anything else you can do to make the tracks sound good together and to have it be the desired finished product.

Hip hop producers are by default mixing their beats, but not always the final track with the vocals."
"That’s step 2. Step 1 is to make sure that your browser’s built-in tracking protection is enabled and set up correctly.

If you use Chrome, you’re doing it wrong (no tracking protection). In Safari, it should be already be enabled by default (but it doesn’t hurt to check). In Firefox, the custom Content Blocking setup that I recommend is this: https://imgur.com/a/yLAUP2q."
"Lowes has always been my preference. Better organized, better prices, better customer service, better quality lumber. And better benefits for employees (at least when I worked there). They used to call it the womens home improvement store because they marketed toward ls women AMD families rather than contractors."
"OP - Hexonia is worth trying too. This guy’s getting downvoted because of a weird Polytopia vs Hexonia fandom thing. They’re very similar games and so the fandoms feel like they have to pick a side.

They’re both great games. I prefer Polytopia, but Hexonia definitely worth checking out too."
"This has built into Vivaldi for years now, along with a ton of other neat features."

"Platinum: Baby Brezza.

My wife was unable to breast feed, so we had to do formula. Picked one up off of Marketplace. It’s basically a Keurig for baby formula. 

10 seconds, bottle is ready at the perfect temp. No need to mix and measure at 2am running on no sleep with a screaming baby. The infant stage was hard enough (15 months now) with it, can’t even imagine what it would’ve been like without it. 

Gold: Hair clipper. It’s been about 22 years of shaving my head. The one I have was about 40$, 15 years ago, at 4-6 shavings a year (saves about 20$ per time). It’s only gold instead of platinum because I don’t care what my hair looks like."
"I'll compare the two I've stayed at... I'm a parent with 3 kids, so your needs may be different.

Cabana Bay is my favorite.  Nice pools, and the food court is really quick and reasonably priced.  We also like the family suites for the space.  And this is the place to stay if you plan to spend a lot of time at Volcano Bay, because it is much less convenient to get there from anywhere else.

Hard Rock is nice, the beds are comfy and the pool is fun.  You can't beat the walk to the parks, which is great if you want to get there early or leave at closing.  We found the food to be really good.   It's not as laid-back as Cabana Bay, but definitely ""nicer""- we stayed a few nights only because of the included express pass- for a family of 5, the hotel room was much cheaper than buying EP."
Mountain View. Commute between there and Palo Alto. You can usually find me all over the peninsula and I've only had good experiences.
"There's nothing wrong with being incorrect and learning something new! I still have the instinct to call it 220V too, cause that's what I grew up having it called."
