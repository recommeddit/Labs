60191,best freezer brand,"Kitchenaid and whirlpool are worse than GE I would argue, other than the GE profile. With most other brands I see consistent failures (drain lines and ice makers with Samsung, fans with GE, Compressors with LG) with Kitchenaid/Whirlpool it seems like a crapshoot. There's a 5k fridge out there that I've done everything to and they are less than 3 years old. Evap fan failures, cut harness on the deli drawer, LED's going out, control board failures, deli drawer board under the water dispenser frying, bad seal on the augur motor, drain lines, freon leaks, etc.

Their disassembly is so much worse than any other brand too. 

Frigidaire is probably the only fridge I'd risk buying right now"

57515,best water brand,"Every water. To a true hydrohomie, we cherish all water. I rememver back when I was a small hydrling, I asked my hydrodad, “father, what is the best water?”  He responded with a sentence that changed my life. “All water is precious son. I remember when the Soda tribe took your mother, I almost turned away from the hydration, but then, I saw him. The true hydrohomie. He came down from the clouds and handed me a bottle of water unlike any I have seen before. He told me to take it with me wherever I go. That bottle has the power to turn into any water possible.” 10 months later, he died in a Soda tribe attack. As I held him in my arms, he handed me the bottle and said “son, take this to remember me”. And then he died. So I say again, all water is precious."
