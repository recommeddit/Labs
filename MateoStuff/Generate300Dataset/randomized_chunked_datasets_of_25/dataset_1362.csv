I agree a spa say would be awesome, provided that she was completely comfortable with whoever was looking after bubs as it could be difficult for her to fully relax. 
Ask her what she needs from you! Better to get a loving neck rub every night than one expensive gesture IMO!"

33430,best electric car,"Who cares. They strap a motor to a shell and call it “drivable”. Whoopdee fuckin do. Its still a concept and not production. Most of the “concepts” companies show off arent drivable vehicles. Theyre shapes with just enough parts to get to and sit on a display stand. Thats the way the industry works. 

Who cares if the commercial was cgi either. News flash, most are. The fact remains, gm has a much better capacity to deliver on their products and promises than tesla."

44105,best items under $100,Cast iron is very heavy and so it holds a lot of heat.  When you slap a piece of meat on a pan a lot of heat goes from the pan into the food and cools the pan until the burner can heat it up again.  With cast iron the pan doesn't cool as much since it has a lot of mass so you get a more even cooking experience.  Also you can put a cast iron pan in the oven so you can do things like a shepards pie all in one pan.  Plus the things are near indestructable and good for hitting burglars with.

It looks odd but it feels so much more natural. I even got a bunch of people at my office to buy one after they tried mine.

943,best desk lamp,"That's actually really cool. I was thinking about building a section on my desk where I can stand. Also using stuff from IKEA, there was this blog post a while ago: http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html

I probably will do this the next time I make a trip to IKEA.
