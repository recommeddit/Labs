16698,best pet for toddlers,"Cat.  At that age the girls can clean out a litter box and feed and water it.  Cat also entertains itself.

A dog needs to be walked and shit picked up. At that age your kids aren't ready for that - a dog would basically be more chores for the adults, do you want more chores?

Rodents are bad for the same reason - gerbils, hamsters, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs - bedding needs to be changed frequently.

Fish are ok, after the initial $$$$$ getting the setup equipment, they just need to be fed daily and the filters swapped out and whatever with the water."
64539,Best Nike running shoes,"Ground feel is a good description for the LT3's. I saw those same shoes on FootLocker's site, I wonder how they even have them available. I just chatted with Nike's support and they officially ""have no release date for the Streak 6's"" so there is our answer."

14677,best romantic novel,"I think i've read a few over the years, and my all time favorite will be **P.S: I Love You by Cecelia Ahern**. The thing I mostly don't like is that they are kind of predictable and sometimes way too cheesy, and also, if I read them in spanish the translation seems to suck and be very cringey which I can't stand, because it's probably translated to be hispanic neutral or something."
1897,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Try the blonde bunny.  The others are ok but that bunny is stellar.
62853,Best Data Science textbook,"Yep, it's pretty good though a bit slow for my taste"
59759,best perfume,"That’s a really fascinating list for a number of reasons, including that there are only four women’s perfumes in the top 20. It seems very unlikely that male-leaning fragrances are subjectively ‘better’. I mean, Chanel no 5 has been the pre-eminent cultural touchstone for fine fragrance for almost exactly a century, compared to which Aventus’s prominence is a blink of an eye. 

I realise that maybe it’s my own biases at play here, but my sense is that women have a much greater diversity of perfume available and acceptable to wear in a variety of situations and are much less likely to obsess over batch codes and subtle (non-existent?) variations in performance. And are perhaps more likely to review both male and female scents?"
6011,best programming language for web development,You should be learning to make websites instead of languages. You already know enough to take you a long way. I would make some simple pages with html/css and javascript. These are all front-end technologies so you don't need a server setup or a fancy dev environment. You can make a index.html file on your desktop and do some pretty amazing things right in one file. Knowing this side of it well will make a big difference when you move on to other languages.
52055,best iphone case,"But dubious about the 5G claim, but has anyone tried this case and if it sits flat lying on its back? In the picture it looks like it’s got a counter bump on the bottom.

Aww yiss."
38078,best Marvel movie,"I just felt that it was a story we’ve seen over and over again, I found Black Panther himself to be really boring every time he was on screen, also the whole pretending he was dead thing was 30 minutes of wasted screen time and a really dumb narrative choice. I thought most of the action was poorly shot, and probably the biggest of all, the 3rd act is a mess of truly bad special effects. I loved Black Panther in Civil War, I thought he was so awesome but his solo movie was was just disappointing. I even went back to the theater a second time after not liking it just to see if I was crazy for not thinking it was all that good like everyone was saying and ended up walking out still very lukewarm on it."
14641,best romantic novel,Loved this book! Can't wait for the next in the series!
16741,best pet for toddlers,"Gerbils are good. They don’t poo and pee very much, and aren’t as stinky as other rodents. They are also fairly friendly, don’t bite, and they all have their own little personalities. 

They don’t like being alone, but they are also territorial, so make sure you buy as many as you want from the same clan. You can’t really mix and match them from different places."
1972,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Paesanos was my go-to but they closed.  Lilsy is OK.  My work gets Taffy's for special events...that makes Woodstocks taste good.  I was super disappointed in Olio...their carbonara pizza was basically scrambled eggs and we watched the dude pick shells out of our pizza for the quail egg pizza.  

These days, I mostly make it...Whole foods has Tipo 00 flour for about $3 from Italy."

37090,best amusement park,"I just updated the top 25 parks with all the unlisted coasters and total coaster counts. All unlisted coasters are worth zero points (think kiddie coasters, garbage coasters, Vekoma SLCs and Boomerangs). I also did the work for you and averaged every coaster, including the crap ones. (Sub-500 coasters are all in ""500th place"")

These deeeeefinitely factor when determining a median. Check out Six Flags New England and Carowinds for a hell of an example."
