"Series 1 is top notch amazing! But this is one of those shows that you only want to watch the first season. While there are others, they pale in comparison."

"There were a lot of complaints about the iPhone 12 Apple Leather Case. Reviewers said that it was built differently than previous years with a painted-on surface that flakes away over time. No idea if thatâ€™s true, but just figured Iâ€™d give Moment a shot. Got the Dark Cherry Apple one yesterday though and it looks beautiful."
"So there are ways to go about it without asking them directly - usually it involves both thought and splurging. If you're going to buy something hobby-related, you want to shell out extra money otherwise they will probably already have whatever it is. 

For instance, I had a leather guitar strap custom made for my guy. He is a huge Led Zeppelin fan so I had LZ quotes tooled into it along with his own symbol. He said it was the best gift he had ever received.

Happy birthday!  I usually go for craft beers or a whiskey sour
"It's basically the standard now.

If you do want a bit of a tone, oxford white has a tiny blue undertone. Good against greys like concrete or grey brick."
Spiderman 3 was a great movie.
"He's hella iconic, but was never very good."
yup

"As a primary care doctor I just wanted to say great job OP. I don't know if you're a doctor or pharmacist or what, but this list and the advice in general is great. 

As to when you should stop self-treating and see a doctor make sure it's not a bacterial illness needing antibiotics, I think the following symptoms would be reasonable thresholds to seek treatment for cold-like symptoms: fever (measured with a thermometer), shortness of breath or cough for more than 4 weeks. Even with these symptoms viral illness is still the most likely cause, but the possibility of bacterial infection is high enough to warrant a checkup. Of course if you're older than 65 or medically complex get review earlier as bacterial infections are more common in this case. 

As a side note, if you do see a doctor but worry about antibiotic overprescribing, it can help a lot to mention to your doctor that you'd prefer to avoid antibiotics if possible. Many doctors feel that patients will be upset if they don't get antibiotics, so telling them upfront will take this pressure off and allow them to make a rational decision as to whether you need them or not."
"Gould and Lewontin's [Spandrel Paper](http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/03_Areas/evolution/perspectives/Gould_Lewontin_1979.shtml) is generally considered to be one of the more important ones, whether or not you agree with it. It was presented to me as something I should be able to say I had read, by a professor who had taken to calling the authors ""The Harvard Commies""."

"I'd like to get my husband a pair of Red Wings. Alas, he has monstrous feet that are wide with the biggest big toe I've ever seen on a person. So I can't surprise him. We'll have to go to a store so he can get the right fit, and get the style he wants. Mr. Fix-it has saved us literally tens of thousands of dollars throughout the years. He deserves comfy feets."
"the red squiggly line in Word

You're not alone. The ESLs love their semicolons and commas. Who the fuck needs a period when you can make one big paragraph using semicolons and commas? And make sure you copy/paste an entire dictionary term for a word your audience already knows. Who cares? It's words on the screen for a word count. oh, and don't forget to give us a history of the thing from Wikipedia first and use like half the content for that because getting to the point in the last paragraph is super cool."

Did you try out their Home Try-On kit before ordering? I've never heard of this brand before so I'm curious
