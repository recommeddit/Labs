"Stan Lee. He was my neighbor for a while, and he directly wrote me letters which I now have framed on my wall. Tom Brady wasn't great, Steven Tyler was really cool/chill, but Stan Lee was the best by far."
Everyone uses arch btw.
"Well I‚Äôve just looked at Diablo 3 on YouTube, I don‚Äôt like them types of RPG, prefer the Witcher type"
Check out NEFFEX. You'll definitely find good ones!
Been using the Corsair HS70...yeah the earpads cushion is failing on me slowly peeling off and I see that it can't be replaced. What about SteelSeries Arctis 1 and Asus ROG Strix GO 2.4?
"Movie - Reservoir Dogs
Series - Breaking Bad"
Yes I agree.
"It‚Äôs not playable in the Americas but it is in Europe, Oceania and some parts of Asia. I live in Mexico, and downloaded the game with a VPN set to London. 

The game plays like a wonder on iPad Pro but I stopped playing because it doesn‚Äôt have role queue yet, and even after ranking up to Emerald, match after match there was always 3 DPS, or last person to choose went Ahri or some shit instead of the jungle we needed, then it was a shower of ‚ÄùRetreat!"" pings, Turkish cuss words, and it culminated with someone going AFK or feeding 0-22.

There‚Äôs a slim chance that when it‚Äôs released here next month we‚Äôll have role queue but I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath."
"I got gifted a massage gift card. Problem is I have extreme anxiety about strangers touching me. I ended up regifting the card because just thinking about using it stressed me out.

I made sure the person who got it talked about wanting to get a massage."
Dang. It used to be.
"Thanks! Made it easy to narrow down my options by requirements like international calling and unlimited data. Ended up going with Google Fi despite it not being on the recommended list - any reason, in particular, it isn't recommended?"
"The Best Romance Books of the Decade was an outstanding addition to the sub.  [Thank you so much](https://media.giphy.com/media/69FmYZBku9m81vhGH3/giphy.gif) for all of the time and effort you put into it!  Love seeing the results.

Edited to add:  WooHoo for *A Week to Be Wicked* and *The Duchess War* winning their categories!  ü•≥"
USA Star by John Varvatos is subtle and good for any occasion

"The Pact is on Netflix, that has a twisty surprise ending.

I also second The Orphanage, and add Orphan to the list as well."
15.6in Ryzen 5 4600H GTX 1650Ti 512GB SSD. Does this sound right (good?)
"Nooo I don‚Äôt use that anymore, I just did in the past. Love the taste, hate the issues that come with it."
I want to say ick but that wouldn't be very nice.  How was it?
