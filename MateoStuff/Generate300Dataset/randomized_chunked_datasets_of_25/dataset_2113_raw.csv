Really wish they'd release the 6 nuud case already.

"I’m not sure about palm clawing, it’s so low-profile it’s really better for an out and out claw grip esp at 20x10, but the hump is towards the rear and can support the base of your palm a bit if that’s how you hybrid. 

I had a similar experience with the Model-O though, it felt so big that I should palm it but it wasn’t nearly as comfortable as the Air58 in that respect so I ended up in a hybrid but I didn’t love it. The Model-D is much more comfortable for a palm grip.

On the XM1 I’d say the sides are thin because of its low-profile but I have mine just in front of and just behind the midpoint of the mouse on the right hand side, respectively.

Sorry I can’t be more help, I know making the call can be tough. I’d say of the options as far as I’m familiar, Model-D for palm, XM1 for claw. I think the XM1 is the better mouse but I’d feel bad if I recommended something that wound up being too small for your grip preference."
"Oh my word!! I LOVE final space, the humour is unique Hue is a classic, kvn and the cookies 🍪is too much feel sorry for Gary sometimes"
"Those cheesy Father's Day shirts (""the dad, the myth, the legend,"" and the like) people usually buy as a joke.  My dad loves them and wears them all the time."

This name amuses me greatly. Like they found a bacteria species that causes problems so they just named it ""difficult"" as its scientific name."
"To present the opposite viewpoint, my group found that it took way too long for what it was - a solid introductory engine builder. There's a few things it does well, drafting and making you pay to keep cards makes the decisions more tense right away for what you hold onto and the directions you build your engine and the shared map creates some tension, but for the time it took for us to play, we can get in a few games of Century or Gizmos or other games that satisfy the same engine-building itch.

I've heard that drafting corporations makes the game better, but it seems to me that it will just add to the play time without enough to make up for the increased length."

"No particular order
South Park,
Nier, 
Blood borne,

Fallout

Also worth mentioning:
Nioh,
FF15,
Dark Souls 3,
Dust (awesome indie game),
Child of Light"
"Own a pc, switch and ps4. Exclusives are on their respective systems obviously. Platformers and games that are better handheld or better played in short bursts are on switch. Rest goes on to pc.

Maybe I'd have preferred ps4 more if I had a giant tv with a couch setup or something and my pc wasn't hooked up to it. But all my devices are connected to the same 27 inch monitor so, pc and console experience is more or less the same to me. Therefore, playing/owning the games on a platform that allows higher fidelity is a no-brainer."
"People say the first half is slow, but I was hooked from the start.  Glad you're enjoying it so far."
"I’ve tried so many times to like Kendrick but man I just don’t get it. I think it’s his voice that throws me off. Also I’m a sucker for College Dropput and I think I’d switch it out with MBDTF. Not having NWA on this list is criminal. Top 10 lists of an entire genre are almost impossible, and it’s all subjective anyway!"
"Try Reamde, I'm not a massive fan of his writing either, however Reamde was a good read but not exactly scifi more modern fiction thriller with modern tech sprinkled in."
"SFOG is popular, but there is another park in Georgia that people probably don’t know exist."
If you find anything on what you have mentioned above please share it with me as well. Thanks.
Maui Jims and Costas are worth it to me. The lens quality and feel of the glasses themselves is absolutely worth it.
"Man, I'm new to this hobby and didn't realise so many games were always coming out! It's a little intimidating tbh, the thought of having so many classics to catch up on while new things are coming out.

I guess I just need to take my time and enjoy."
Not a big Snoop Dogg fan... I'm not sure about Nas either. I can't remember the third
"Wow that’s honesty the best top 100 list I’ve seen. All the shows I’ve watched from there are very solid, and the ones I haven’t yet, I’ve heard only praise about. It’s pretty funny that all the shows in my top 10 are in that top 100 except Gintama and even that is in the top 150. Take my award for that really well-compiled list."
More recent success and also the treble + first English side to win. I’d say they’re equal.
Hey that's super nice of you! If it's the space cats discord I'll definitely use that as a resource. Otherwise I might keep hold of all our big questions after our first session on Monday and send you ones we cant find the answer to.
"I'm facing exactly the same dilemma. So far I too have identified the LG27GL850 as an option, as well as the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. They are similarly priced and have very similar specs, so I'd appreciate any input on which to choose (or if there is something else entirely)."
I like assumptions
