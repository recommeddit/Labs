"[Publish or Perish](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish) will search the literature for you and give you useful meta-information, like the impact of the paper and authors (so you know if something was published in a garbage-tier journal). It's good for getting into a new literature.

[SJR](http://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?area=3200&order=sjr&ord=desc) is good for getting journal rankings. Not all scientific journals are created equal!

There are also open-access journals like [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org) and [PLOS](https://plos.org).

You can also search for newer articles in pre-print archives like [bioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/) and [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/). 

Lastly, if you find some article you want to read and cannot find it somewhere else, find the corresponding author and send them a short, polite email asking for the paper. No need to elaborate on who you are or why you want it, just ask. It's so easy."

"I have been to many kinds of all inclusives and otherwise. The best have a variety of activities, a variety of restaurants and available excursions. And are close enough to the action. This means the ""best"" as far as potential enjoyment. However, I have had just as much fun at 2 star places as 5 star. The difference is in how much you care about variety and ""level"" of food, the breadth of bar choices, and how active you expect to be. Also, the cheapest places tend to draw the kind of folks who may only care about unlimited booze and so you may deal with drunks and puke and drunken drama. And you have to put yourself in the equation too. If you expect to sit back and have happy times come to you and want perfection at every turn, there is not a single resort that won't disappoint you. If you show up, put your outgoing personna on and search out and join in to activities, talk to people - you will have fun.

"> Which other pokemon games are worth playing?

All of them. Thanks to nostalgia most people's recommendations will be whichever game they played first, but if you've only played Moon I'd recommend either XY or ORAS next. Going back several generations at once can throw you for a loop with old mechanics. It's harder to judge a game fairly when you're diving straight into it after being spoiled with the QoL of newer games.

> Which one has the best story?

From what I've seen, BW is considered one of the series's strongest stories, and I'd agree with that. (In terms of story, it's best to play BW before B2W2; other than that all the games can be played in any order.)"
">I'm doing this based on how much i feel like anime have effected the community not necessarily how good they are

I like your definition of ""must watch"". [It's very similar to how I define it,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/2hvjtr/your_top_6_must_watch_animes/ckwgrl4) as opposed to these lists of people's favorite anime that seem to make up most of the comments in this thread. 

>Neon Genesis Evangalion: THE Mecha show. Now I haven't seen this show either but from what i've heard it's story is so amazing that it has a cult following.

Check out my quick little entry about Evangelion in the comment I linked. Do not watch Eva because you want to see badass mecha fights. Because, while the mecha fights are quite good, they are definitely not the focus of the show so you'll most likely be disappointed. It is a *heavy* and draining watch once you get into the second part of the show because the various psychological problems afflicting the main characters begin to manifest more obviously and torment them. 

>FMA:Brotherhood

> It just is #1 on MAL and I barely hear about it.

Brotherhood is definitely an excellent anime, and it's No. 1 status on MAL is largely due to it's unequaled universal appeal. Many people absolutely love it, and even those that don't at least like it. This agreement spawns very little debate and discussion, which is part of the reason why you never see it mentioned. The other part of the reason it's never discussed is because what you see is what you get. There isn't much to interpret in this anime. The motivations of all the characters are fairly apparent and it's pretty easy for every viewer to grasp everything that's occurring in the story. Many anime discussions are spawned by someone asking ""I don't understand why character A did this in Anime A""? or ""Why did Event B occur in Anime B""? Nobody asks these questions about it because everyone that watches FMA:B understands these things. On the other end of the spectrum is Evangelion, who's entire plot goes largely unexplained during the series, with fans writing theses on it's story based on tiny little bits of information gleamed after multiple rewatches of the anime. The difference between these two isn't that Evangelion is ""intelligent"" and Brotherhood is ""dumb"", it's that these 2 anime have completely different goals in mind. FMA:Brotherhood wants to create a compelling story full of exciting characters that will engage and entertain the viewer. Evangelion wants to examine the psychological implications of the mecha trope of young teens bearing the burden of protecting the world from a great threat by piloting super-advanced mecha. People don't understand the story because they're not supposed to...because it's not important for accomplishing the creator's intent. They are both very different and both great anime because both are able to accomplish their very different goals in spectacular fashion.

Sorry I wrote so much but I got on a roll there. Hopefully you were able to gain something from reading it. Happy watching! Well, at least if you're watching FMA: Brotherhood. Not so happy watching if you decide to check out Evangelion ;)"

"Agent Provacateur is a great, sexy, musky rose which you can buy online in big bottles very cheap. I know I’ve bought enough gallons of it for the ex (her favourite)
Juicy Couture a surprisingly good white floral also dead cheap

Tommy Girl/Tommy ditto
Encre Noire and its flankers - men’s classic as previously noted by others
Guerlain Vetiver - large bottles are great value for this classic Vetiver 
Middle eastern shops for great value frags by unknown names in a rose/oud vein
Lush - amazing scents at great prices eg Breath of God"
