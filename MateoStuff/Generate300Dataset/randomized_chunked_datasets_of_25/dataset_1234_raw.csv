"I’ve had a couple Vera Bradley backpacks and I love them! They last a while and are a good quality. I’ve tried jansport but they are always super droopy and it really bothers me, but my Vera Bradley’s have never done that. Although they do tend to be a bit girly"
"A [shampoo brush](https://www.amazon.com/Scalp-Massager-Shampoo-Brush-MAXSOFT/dp/B074ZDXFL6/). Not only does my hair feel cleaner than ever since getting one, but my scalp doesn't itch anymore. I tried everything including prescription shampoos. I didn't have dandruff or any other issue that should cause the itching, but all the same my head itched so bad all the time I wanted to shave my head and rub sandpaper on my scalp to get some relief. 

Got one of these to help scrub my head and now while I might get a tiny itch here and there, I no longer want to rip my scalp off to make the itching stop."
Still water : Volvic.  Sparkling water: Perrier (San Pellegrino a close second).
"Without a doubt the GOAT, is Jerry Rice. I fully believe that both Joe Montana and Steve Young would not be half as respected as they are if they weren't throwing the ball to Rice. 

He shattered so many records in a time when the league was no where near as protective or pass happy as they are today. And he did it with largely inferior physical talent, but just with a knowledge of the game and a unquenchable work ethic."

"depends. there are nice parts, but also pretty shitty and/or rundown parts. Also, if you're American, get used to the fact that we are not those nice small talky guys. We like our privacy, which may could be seen as rude, but it's just normal here"
"Bad idea, they won't be able to watch the other good/decent anime if they start with god-tier ones. They will find themselves in need of atleast on par or a better anime than the ones mentioned above."

Most of these players would be valuable just because they're very young.
In my area Verizon has the best service but I was with them for over 10 years then they changed their plans to no longer include unlimited & my bill was ridiculously high so I switched to TMobile. It's almost just as good for 1/2 of what I was paying at Verizon. Verizon isn't really worth the money unless you travel for work or frequent places with alot of dead spots.
Most of the players in the ENG national team are way overpriced
"Diablo 3 is the result of blizzard having MMO-mania and forgetting what made 1 & 2 so good. They failed, had to basically relaunch the game, and figured out how to make it fun."
"It might be, but I've seen people with bigger hands enjoy it too - all preference depending on grips"
"In all seriousness, it's actually immensely helpful when you cant find an orange shirt.  It'll tell you the aisle and bay within the aisle it's located.  Definitely helped me out once or twice finding an oddball item the wife wanted."
"Statistics

**Best**: You can play in anyone's backyard. The degree is super versatile.

**Worst**: (not for me but for a lot) You need to be talented in English and math. In all honesty, being well-rounded is more useful than being talented in one field."

"Seconded. I was expecting to see way more Baby Keem under this thread in general lol. There are so many bangers on Die For My Bitch, especially the last three songs (Orange Soda, Not My Bro, Apologize)."

"In no particular order.

* Stetson Black. This one goes *perfectly* with some soaps and deodorant I received for Christmas and is thus higher up on my list than it normally would be. It's an object lesson that layering makes a difference.

*  Zoologist Tyrannosaurus Rex. This one is hard to wear-- what's the appropriate social situation to smell like a Cretaceous apocalypse?-- but I appreciate it for the artistry and I've spritzed it on around the house more than once. Definitely going to look into Gardoni's work with Bogue, I think he's got an incredible nose.

* Givenchy Gentleman Only Absolute. My go-to spicy winter scent for a few years now, it never fails to get positive attention when I wear it out. 

* Roja Creation-E Parfum Cologne. Probably the most sophisticated frag I own a decant of (certainly the most expensive at retail) and it smells like it. Beautifully boozy and robust, I was worried at first that I'm too young for it but I love it so much that I'm gonna keep it in rotation.

* Jovan Fever. Yes, another cheapie, but a fragrance doesn't need to cost $300 to be worth wearing, and this one's the workhorse of my fragrance drawer-- to extend the ""starting lineup"" metaphor, one could say it gets the most ""minutes per game"". It's a very wearable, slightly sweet woody-tobacco cologne that I wish I knew existed when I was in college. Its relative obscurity (this is a fairly uncommon Jovan flanker) appeals to me as it's not overexposed, and the insanely low price makes it a great addition to anyone's medicine cabinet. This is the bottle I reach for when I don't feeling like debating what to wear and I've only heard good things when wearing it. I will take it upon myself to be Fever's one-man hype brigade in 2021."
"The scariest part of that is if she did say yes. I mean, how the hell would you impress Lady Gaga on a date?"
I think you are full of shit.
The blacks are pretty good. No real complaints with contrast. The colors in general on this monitor are great. A lot of people complain about backlight bleed on ips monitors but it's pretty minimal with these. I had a 2070 super in this build but I had to RMA it so I've been running my old 970 for awhile until my replacement comes in and I'm still getting decent framerates in most games. I think your 1660 will be fine. Granted I'm not playing anything super taxing with the 970 mostly just league or valorant which run on almost anything.
