4822,"Depends on what I'm buying. My Lowe's usually has better dimensional lumber like 2x4s... I don't have to search to find one. And I like kobalt over husky. But I like Ridgid power tools and that's a home Depot thing. My home Depot also has better stocked and organized electrical and plumbing departments. Home Depot has a hobby lumber department with oak boards and such, but my Lowe's doesn't. The paint is comparable at both. So it's a toss up and depends on what I'm buying. 

But I use true value for nuts and bolts... So much better than either",best home improvement store

73091,"Completely agree! I'm net to Linux, but I was making attempts several times already. Have been spending some time with Ubuntu (since it's always advertised as the best place to start), Fedora and a few days ago decided to give Manjaro a try and I was very pleasantly surprised how easy everything was, TLP and powertop included, switching flatpak and snap on is extremely easy and even stuff like manjaro vaapi package available as one installation, including multiple drivers you need, make it so easy to use it. Manjaro's UX for me is way ahead Ubuntu's and after couple of days of testing I set up monthly contribution on their website. Love it!",best Linux distro

8231,"Where are you finding it? I bought 4 tubes of the Burt's Bees with NovaMin and burned through all of them, and then found out that everything with NovaMin has been discontinued because GSK would rather make more money by selling it as prescription only. 

I'm not a dentist, but I did a fair amount of research and it seems that NovaMin does indeed rebuilt enamel, and fairly well. Fluoride doesn't actually rebuild enamel at all, it simply hardens the enamel that's left to protect against erosion.",best toothpaste
