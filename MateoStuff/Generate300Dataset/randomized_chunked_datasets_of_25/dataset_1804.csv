41268,best instrument to play,"Every instrument has their own unique insane difficulty.  For clarinets it's the Break.  For saxes, it's controlling the sound. For oboe players it's the read. For trombone players it's pitch.  For euphonium players it's finding a job once you get out of college..."
45148,best items under $100,"I'm ADD, took Adderall for 3 years & was bored out of my mind. I got slightly better grades, but lost my spontaneous thinking, didn't feel like myself, & every day began to feel the same. Personally, I feel much better off of it."
167,best terminal file manager reddit,"I have yet to see a regex which picks the 10 music files I like most, so I can copy them elsewhere. 

If you work with media files or badly organized files, a file manager is a must."

12966,best gifts for mom,If you have the skills a lot of companies offer a relocation bonus to help you move.
217,best terminal file manager reddit,"I'm with you. I never spent too much time learning a file manager because I always felt I'd forget or become worse at basic *nix utilities to do stuff. I'm not sure that idea is really founded at all, but that's how I felt. I played with Midnight Commander and Norton Utilities for a bit in my old DOS days."
39293,best web browser,">Vivaldi is still based on Chromium.

&#x200B;

I never said it wasn't. Chrome =/= Chromium and Chromium =/= Google's hands in the cookie jar.

>The issues you've mentioned use to exist with previous versions of Firefox, but they've been fixed.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry, but ""it doesn't happen on my machine"" is not a valid solution. It is STILL an issue for me.

This is with 7 idle tabs open and 3 extensions 5 minutes after opening Firefox:   [https://imgur.com/pKpzz1g](https://imgur.com/pKpzz1g)

You can see Chrome  for comparison's sake with the same tabs and extensions open, plus 3 or 4 few more tabs, uses UNDER HALF the RAM Firefox is using. Its ridiculous that you keep insisting this problem doesn't exist when it clearly does. This problem exists on multiple computers at two different physical locations.

If I start opening  more tabs in Firefox (its not uncommon for me to have 15-30 tabs open at once) that number will slowly climb until it nears or eclipses 3 GB RAM, which is *ludicrous* RAM usage for a web browser, and the PC begins to lag, freeze, and become unusable until I close Firefox completely.

&#x200B;

>There are websites and even videos benchmarking the performance of multiple browsers and Firefox has shown to be the most ""complete"" and most efficient among the most known ones.

&#x200B;

Lol, you're telling me to ""do my own research"" yet all you can do is reference benchmarking websites and videos for performance tests *you didn't even do yourself.* You didn't even provide any sources to backup your claims.

&#x200B;

>DYOR!

&#x200B;

See above. I have been ""doing my own research"" on this issue for the better part of a year and longer."
57128,best water brand,"VOSS.  It has a better taste to it, and is not acidic like many other brands of bottled water.  Fiji is also good when I can't find VOSS.  When I'm at home I just drink tap water that has been filtered."

45464,best gaming system,"I'd also be happy to send you what I've got for the 360. There are a few controllers, extra power cord in case yours croaks, and a few games (Red dead, Gears 3, NHL 13, Goldeneye). All of it is unfortunately collecting dust right now, and if it would make you any happier with your new setup, that would make me very happy! Will sanitize and cover shipping, just let me know friendo. Until then, have a blast!"
53453,best usb c charging cable,"It's interesting that people discussing USB PD, when in original post it's lightning cable which doesn't support power delivery. It's means that cable was complete trash and there is nothing to do with a price. I bet there's no chip inside."

4090,best online college,"All schools have some really bad reviews, but even on niche.com it has 4.5 out of 5 stars with over 2,700 reviews. I’m a year in and have no problems with any of it, and prefer the method of education that WGU offers. But I’m also in my 30s, have significant work experience, and don’t need hand holding. My undergrad big 10 public ivy university actually has a lower average score according to that website. For whatever it’s worth Harvard, Stanford, and Yale also have lower star ratings than WGU."
58806,best cologne,"It's popular because it's nice. I didn't know you're *supposed* to wear cologne to stand out, I thought you're supposed to do it to smell nice, or at least thats why I use it"
