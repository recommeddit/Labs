47305,best state to visit in the United States,"LA and LV are interesting places to visit, it just depends on what you want to see. They both have NHL and LA has two NFL teams"
35301,best alcoholic drink,My drink right there. Relaxing and smooth.
5158,best home improvement store,"In my experience, Lowes is better for finish stuff (cabinet hardware, blinds, curtain rods, etc) while Home Depot is better at just about everything else (rough in materials, plumbing supplies, electric, tools)."
70534,best major to study in college,"Best thing I can choose my own path
Worst thing I have no fucking clue what my path is"
64407,best place to pirate mac apps reddit,"You think the CIA is going to run malware on your iPhone? What would they want from you, your family photos? The probability that a Russian or Chinese based hacker is targeting your phone for passwords, credit card info, a way into your home network to gain access to other machines and install ransomware etc FAR outweighs the chances of the CIA using a zer0day on you to do nefarious shit. I'm not saying that they aren't doing it. I'm just saying for the average user, the most clear and present danger is on Android just simply based on the architecture. It's not even that I have a preference over either platform (I'm typing this comment on my Mac mini which is right next to my custom built PC)... This is well documented cybersecurity information. A vast majority of all malware in the world is written for PC or Android. If we are talking strictly viruses etc. That said, we are ALL vulnerable today with the prevalence of web attacks... Phishing, for example. In that instance it's all about being a smart user, but in the case of just downloading files, attachments, or apps that can hijack your machine, Windows / Android are the clear losers.

56000,best action and adventure movie,“Turbo Kid” is what you’re looking for.  It’s currently streaming on Prime.
30896,best country to live in,"I can't speak for the rest of Canada but as an American who had lived in Quebec for 5 years I have some warnings. While Montreal is a woderful city and has many English speakers, Quebec really is like a French speaking country within Canada. They also have a few laws that discriminate against English speakers. For instance, if you are an immigrant then your kids automatically have to go to French school and all of their homework and  school documents are in French. It becomes difficult to help your children with homework or read the school newsletter. You've been warned."
953,best ice cream flavor,"Just tried Phish Food for the first time last night, can confirm"
37493,best amusement park,"My vote, too.  With only Thunderhead and Tennessee Tornado going into the decade they have added unique attractions, expanded their festivals, and continue their story telling experiences.  All to the delight of their devoted guests and new fans to this park in the beautiful smoky mountains.  Wild Eagle, Lightning Rod, Fire Chaser Express and Dragonflier are all uniquely crowd pleasers."
52634,best hiphop album,Aquemini
52487,best hiphop album,Diplomatic Immunity.
54532,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"So I never owned the hyperx fury and control. Hard for me to say, but I imagine they're in the same speed/control range of zero as many other pads as are.

Zero soft is going to be your safe pick into artisans and my personal recommendation if you can't get hien in soft. Hien mid becomes a bit too rough and loses some control from soft and xsoft from what I hear, so zero soft is your best bet for those choices.

Hien xsoft might work too, I just never tried it at that density."
10353,best suitcase lock,And you can finally never change the 2$ briefs underneath it.

54924,best water filter,"Thanks. Out of curiosity, what other things pass through the membrane along with the water? I assume it would be mostly molecules smaller than or similar in size to H2O. Also, what material is used for the membrane in this process?"

47768,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"i recommend the ti 36x pro when my middle school ask me what kind of calculator they should buy.  for $20, it's a crazy powerful calculator that will last them a very long time."
29557,best game console,"Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders is my favorite Xbox exclusive as well, I was thinking of purchasing an Xbox simply for that one game."
4672,best home improvement store,It's like this here in Cleveland. Lowe's feels more like the yuppie store. Better prices available at Home Depot if you aren't as picky about style.
61404,Best RPG game on PS4,"Fishing for the new cult followers, are we? The Trails series is emphatically NOT what the OP is after."
15277,best tree for the garden,"[Album](http://imgur.com/gallery/tLQjM)

Yeah, they're pretty cool for how tall and grandiose they are. I prefer trees with a bit more character though. Sequoia is just tall."
