64407,"You think the CIA is going to run malware on your iPhone? What would they want from you, your family photos? The probability that a Russian or Chinese based hacker is targeting your phone for passwords, credit card info, a way into your home network to gain access to other machines and install ransomware etc FAR outweighs the chances of the CIA using a zer0day on you to do nefarious shit. I'm not saying that they aren't doing it. I'm just saying for the average user, the most clear and present danger is on Android just simply based on the architecture. It's not even that I have a preference over either platform (I'm typing this comment on my Mac mini which is right next to my custom built PC)... This is well documented cybersecurity information. A vast majority of all malware in the world is written for PC or Android. If we are talking strictly viruses etc. That said, we are ALL vulnerable today with the prevalence of web attacks... Phishing, for example. In that instance it's all about being a smart user, but in the case of just downloading files, attachments, or apps that can hijack your machine, Windows / Android are the clear losers.

While Montreal is a woderful city and has many English speakers, Quebec really is like a French speaking country within Canada. They also have a few laws that discriminate against English speakers. For instance, if you are an immigrant then your kids automatically have to go to French school and all of their homework and  school documents are in French. It becomes difficult to help your children with homework or read the school newsletter. You've been warned.",best country to live in

54532,"So I never owned the hyperx fury and control. Hard for me to say, but I imagine they're in the same speed/control range of zero as many other pads as are.

Zero soft is going to be your safe pick into artisans and my personal recommendation if you can't get hien in soft. Hien mid becomes a bit too rough and loses some control from soft and xsoft from what I hear, so zero soft is your best bet for those choices.

Hien xsoft might work too, I just never tried it at that density.",best artisan mousepad alternatives
