27971,best breakfast foods,"Taylor ham, egg and cheese sandwich on a NY-Style bagel. Taylor ham is the best of the breakfast meats, without question. Any other New Jerseyian will confirm. (Pork roll is also an acceptable name.)"
57711,best cologne,Personal favorite: Jake from Hollister. About $40 a bottle and well worth it. Been wearing it for about 10 years now
29828,best money managing app,"Hmmm... You have a point. I suppose it does need an hour of learning. Once you're used to it, though, it *is* easy. I do acknowledge there may exists tools which are easier to pick up."
6145,best Netflix documentary,"Came here to recommend this, great watch!"
32111,best hotel to live in,"It‚Äôs actually not indoor, it‚Äôs outside on a rooftop type of setting! But omg that spa sounds incredible. I am a sucker for rainy weather and storms so that rain room is on my list if I ever go back! I didn‚Äôt see that clock either but it is amazing üòÇ"

7644,best laptop for general use,Can you give me any tips on how to find these third parties selling them? Do I look on Ebay? I want to get a lenovo flex 5 new for $600. How can I do this?

49413,best gaming monitor,"I bought the lg 27gl83a-b recently and it‚Äôs performs great and looks good while doing it in my opinion, but I‚Äôm not exactly an enthusiast so the sRGB mode looks good enough to me."
40347,best midrange GPU,"I haven‚Äôt checked since availability went to shit, but the 1660 super usually fits well into a $1000 budget. 2060 can be made to fit as well. If you‚Äôre willing to stretch and able to find one, a 2070 super or 3070 is a good bet, especially for cp2077. I would use cyber punk benchmarks to pick the card you want, as that‚Äôll let you know about what FPS you can expect with each card.

What are your other specs?"
26263,best politician,"One of the things I like about Goldwater is that he became a libertarian as time went on. It wasn't until late in his life that his support for abortion came out, as well as supporting gay rights. He absolutely loathed the religious right and warned that they were going to hijack the GOP.

It's pretty sad that ""Mr. Conservative"" today would be relentlessly ridiculed for not being conservative enough."

All classics"
40964,best instrument to play,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair at all to say that Timpani is equivalent to Cello or piano. That‚Äôs such an overstatement.
59400,best perfume,Byredo Gypsy Water.   Everyone always asks what it is.
16812,best pet for toddlers,"Hmm, never thought of the pee pad + carpet. Your right... but then again, I'm not completely against doing anything, I just want something that's an easier fit. I know I wont be able to get all my criteria spot on, just looking for  a good balance..."
38198,best newspapers to read,"The Wall Street Journal if you are willing to spend the money for a subscription. The articles are pretty unbiased, but the opinion section is definitely conservative-leaning. I'm not a current subscriber because quite frankly I don't want to pay for it (there are other things I'd rather spend my money on right now), but I enjoyed reading it when I was."

32829,best free online grammar checker,"Something that was a total game changer for me was using the Read Aloud function on Microsoft word (I‚Äôm assuming they have similar accessibility functions on Mac) but it will read your paper out to you and it‚Äôs a good way to check for errors. I find it works better than reading it aloud yourself because your brain will naturally fix errors without you noticing. This catches major errors as well as allowing you to see if something sounds weird even if it‚Äôs technically grammatically correct. I use grammarly premium and that works nicely, especially if you want to split the fees with peers and share an account. However, I think I‚Äôll find myself using the Read Aloud function more than grammarly, even though it‚Äôs a bit more time consuming."
72068,best movies with a cool twist,"I also loved it how they made it that they have been on the ship for like 1000 years. At first they were talking about speeding up evolution and I was like, speeded up in 20 years that's bull. Than the end was like ohhhhhh"
