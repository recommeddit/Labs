69937,"I'm not confident regarding the curriculum of most schools, but I know some have engineering majors take almost identical classes during the first year or two of college, allowing students to commit to a specific engineering field after taking some electives.

Edit: I completely understand that most curriculum is different in some way, and that most introduce major-specific classes early on (that's why I mentioned it above).  I'm speaking mostly to the schools that intentionally parallel the curriculum for the first year or two for all (or most) engineering majors to allow for a choice to be made after some engineering electives have been taken, and the decision is more informed.",best major to study in college

6412,"If you liked *American Movie*, I think you'll love *Dancing Outlaw*. It's a short documentary, cheaply made for a local West Virginia PBS station, but it soon went viral through VHS copies and word-of-mouth due to its fascinating subject: Jesco White, a white trash, sociopathic, glue-sniffing, Elvis-impersonating tap dancer in rural Appalachia.

It's on YouTube:

The *Jackass* producers financed a full-length follow-up 20 years later, *The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia*, also excellent, which follows Jesco and his extended family for a year. ([Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQBiXDNVeSA))",best Netflix documentary
