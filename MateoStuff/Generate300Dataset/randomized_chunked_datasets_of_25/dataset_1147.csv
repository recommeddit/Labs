69937,best major to study in college,"I'm not confident regarding the curriculum of most schools, but I know some have engineering majors take almost identical classes during the first year or two of college, allowing students to commit to a specific engineering field after taking some electives.

Edit: I completely understand that most curriculum is different in some way, and that most introduce major-specific classes early on (that's why I mentioned it above).  I'm speaking mostly to the schools that intentionally parallel the curriculum for the first year or two for all (or most) engineering majors to allow for a choice to be made after some engineering electives have been taken, and the decision is more informed."
27689,best bollywood actor,"you know I started liking ranveer esp during his padmavat promotions (and i gave up on bollywood a while back) and based on how dedicated he was and even was about to respect him but somehwere down the line during his promotions for simmmba and gully boy (esp when he had the level of self importance to jump into a crowd of people) i started seeing how crazy he is. No matter how talented he is, he carries his fame very poorly and he's taking it far too seriously. It's like they start to believe their own marketing material almost."

72905,best Linux distro,"Became? It's been the ""hacker distro"" ever since it was called Backtrack.

Also it was never meant to be more than a bootable hacking toolbox."
41848,movies like Inception,"I put off watching this for a while just because it's in German and I worried I wouldn't catch all the subtitles since I'm usually doing other stuff while watching.

Turns out that even though I paid 100% attention, I still was confused for at least the first half of the series.  If you've seen it, you understand what I mean when I say it's hard to track who's who after a little while.

But ultimately, I loved it.  Sounds like Season 2 is going to be out next year. Can't wait."

6412,best Netflix documentary,"If you liked *American Movie*, I think you'll love *Dancing Outlaw*. It's a short documentary, cheaply made for a local West Virginia PBS station, but it soon went viral through VHS copies and word-of-mouth due to its fascinating subject: Jesco White, a white trash, sociopathic, glue-sniffing, Elvis-impersonating tap dancer in rural Appalachia.

It's on YouTube:

The *Jackass* producers financed a full-length follow-up 20 years later, *The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia*, also excellent, which follows Jesco and his extended family for a year. ([Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQBiXDNVeSA))"
