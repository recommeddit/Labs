"Is Arctis Pro Wireless still the only choice after all these years if I want to connect to two devices simultaneously via wireless and bluetooth?

"If you don’t mind used, 1080’s are going for 250-300 around locally lately. I picked mine up for 250. Noticeably better than a 1660ti, but also not brand new."
