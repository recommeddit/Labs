47530,best state to visit in the United States,Cross country road trips (4 times) and national parks (many but many still to do).
6597,best Netflix documentary,Wild Wild Country kinda freaked me out. I really had a difficult time determining the sincerity of the people interviewed. Which I suppose is good when the subject is a criminal conspiracy/cult.
6149,best Netflix documentary,Watch the Ken Burns WW2 documentary. The Pacific theater is almost completely ignored in favor of the European theater but what they fought through and experienced was really awful.

4799,best home improvement store,"As others have mentioned, it varies from place to place... but I prefer HD for my raw materials (lumber, adhesives, fasteners, electrical supplies, etc.) and Lowes for my ""finishing touches"" (lighting, fixtures, appliances, etc.)."
72536,best keyboard switches,"Its preference, but if your aiming is gaming, then id say the Cherry MX ""Speeds"" or Silver, they have the fastest actuation point and give a slight edge. They're like reds in feel though, but they're also exclusive to the some models from Corsair that are not exactly cheap.

Feel wise, my K70 RGB Rapidfire is amazing."

47673,best state to visit in the United States,"Oregon:
- crater lake
- the coast

There's so much more... I've lived in 5 different states and Oregon is easily my favorite"
7917,best laptop for general use,"Yes and no. 

There is an open m.2 slot for extra storage, which is nice, but there's no 2.5"" bay, which would offer the ability to add cheap gaming storage; a 2 TB HDD is well under $100, which is a fraction of what a 2 TB NVMe SSD would run you.

It will cost some money to get more storage in there, but it is easy enough to do with the open bay. 

I would also suggest upgrading the ram, which also has an open dual channel to pair with the 8GB already in it"

9713,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I was in Anacapa my first year. I loved it, it was literally steps away from the beach, as in you stepped out the door, crossed a small road and were right at the beach steps. It was on campus/near the other channel island dorms, which was what I wanted, so I was close to friends and most classes.

I guess my complaints are that the dryers didn't dry so well, and I was in a triple, so space was limited. Also Anacapa is the furthest from IV, so the weekends were a bit of a trek. Not that I minded that much, traipsing through campus at night with your friends is kind of fun. 

From the sound of it, I'd think you'd enjoy either Anacapa, Santa Cruz, or Manzanita. I found those to be more quiet and they're all very close to the beach."
