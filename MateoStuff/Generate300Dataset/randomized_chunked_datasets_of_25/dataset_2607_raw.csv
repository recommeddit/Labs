"> Competitors are starting to get close to Tesla's real-world ranges

Yea, I what it is is that nobody provides all three:

1. Costs about the same or less than a Tesla
2. Charges about as fast or faster than a Tesla
3. Has as about the same or more range than a Tesla

Mach-e does #1 and #3. Taycan does #2 and #3. Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf does #1 and #3 (if you compare to the short range Teslas).  ID.4 does #1.  Hyundai Kona does #1 and #3.

Nobody has yet hit the trifecta."
"Serengeti is owned by Bushnell. Advanced optics (polarization, photochromic lenses) are standard, and they can be found at the same price point as non-polarized Luxottica shades. I've had the same pair of Serengeti Napolis as driving glasses for probably 10 years and 3 cars, and I have no plans to replace them. I left my Wayfarers at a bar in NYC, found a pair of Serengeti Carlo for $45 on EyeDictive to replace them, and now couldn't care less I don't have my Wayfarers. 

I'm with you on the Luxottica front. I have a pair of Wayfarers from the 60s when they were made by Bausch and Lomb, and those things are tanks. The pair I lost weren't even comparable."

My criterion was making it real so that I could live there. Its about being a soldier and its about being in space. See space. It doesn't work like gravity. It's.. different. And when you take that into account its a whole different kind of mode."

"This list has been around at least a few years, although the url has changed.  It used to be austranet something or other, but that stopped working a while back.  *Ender's Game* is just an extremely popular book for some reason."

"Depends on the institution. Have you taken the SAT or ACT? You may need to take these exams. However, these exams are given all over the country and you can just go to the testing location closest to you. Seriously, you shouldn’t consider a school that has no admissions requirements (and even DeVry requires SAT/ACT scores)."

"The zero and probably the otsu v2 are your best bet for good control with the zero being a ""premium"" upgrade to the gsr. I play cs and valorant with all five pads, but zero and hayate otsu v2 have the best control."
Try the **Grado SR60** for example.
