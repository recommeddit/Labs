28915,best breakfast foods,Oh thanks for sharing!
20690,best workout music,RASPUTIN. Ahhh those Russians.
52408,best hiphop album,"i don't think anyone is ""debating"" Illmatic deserving to be on this list. It's easily one of, if not the best rap albums ever made. Nas has had a ton of shit albums and songs, but I don't think anyone could argue that the album that contains NY State of Mind, Represent, Life's a Bitch, Halftime, and the World is Yours doesn't deserve to be in the top 10."
26654,best board games,Yes Twilight Struggle is the best. Must have for everyone who likes 2 player games and strategy games (and history?;))
10341,best suitcase lock,Flair guns? Are those the guns that people use to put flair next to their usernames?
26205,best politician,"LBJ, by virtue of having important meetings on the toilet. I guess passing civil rights bills was okay too."
33248,best electric car,"I'm not even a truck person, and I want a Lightning. 

Bidirectional charging is a huge leap forward in EV technology and is truly the killer app for this thing. I am thinking about giving up my Mustang just for the bidirectional charging on the Lightning, to push the technology forward."
46232,best trick or treating candy,"Fuck kids in your neighborhood.  I know people who leave buckets out all the time and the kids will take maybe one or two more than they are supposed to, but never the whole bucket."
56690,best desktop monitor,"I've done a lot of research into monitors and GPUs after I read your post yesterday and I am curious to what you think of using Adaptive Vsync on a 75hz monitor with a 1050 ti? I know that v sync can get bad when your GPU under produces fps, but I think adaptive V sync auto turns v sync on and off depending if you are over or under. (again I think) Besides the small input lag, how do you think this would compare to no adaptive sync at all? would screen tearing get worse? or better?"
68178,best science fiction novel,"Ha, it was the same with me, more or less. And it has been the first book I read from PKD. When I rented it in the library I didn't barely know PKD, I just knew that Blade Runner was loosely based on one of his stories. So I took the only book available then and it was UBIK and I was in for a treat! :)"

29671,best game console,"Great post!

Can I make a couple more recommendations for the PS2 list?:

Ace Combat 04, 5, and Zero. Great flight shooter games through and through. Extra love for AC04. Of note, Vector Thrust on Steam Early Access is created in the spirit of these games.

Persona 3 FES and Persona 4. JRPG's released for the PS2 that offer compelling characters and stories. Related to Catherine in the PS3/Xbox 360 list, as they come from the same developer and have some in-universe crossover."
8132,best toothpaste,"*Electrifying*

It also doubles as a good ~~vibrator~~ mouth massager"
