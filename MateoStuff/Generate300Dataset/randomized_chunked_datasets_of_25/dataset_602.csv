52408,"i don't think anyone is ""debating"" Illmatic deserving to be on this list. It's easily one of, if not the best rap albums ever made. Nas has had a ton of shit albums and songs, but I don't think anyone could argue that the album that contains NY State of Mind, Represent, Life's a Bitch, Halftime, and the World is Yours doesn't deserve to be in the top 10.",best hiphop album

56690,"I've done a lot of research into monitors and GPUs after I read your post yesterday and I am curious to what you think of using Adaptive Vsync on a 75hz monitor with a 1050 ti? I know that v sync can get bad when your GPU under produces fps, but I think adaptive V sync auto turns v sync on and off depending if you are over or under. (again I think) Besides the small input lag, how do you think this would compare to no adaptive sync at all? would screen tearing get worse? or better?",best desktop monitor

When I rented it in the library I didn't barely know PKD, I just knew that Blade Runner was loosely based on one of his stories. So I took the only book available then and it was UBIK and I was in for a treat! :)",best science fiction novel

29671,"Great post!

Can I make a couple more recommendations for the PS2 list?:

Ace Combat 04, 5, and Zero. Great flight shooter games through and through. Extra love for AC04. Of note, Vector Thrust on Steam Early Access is created in the spirit of these games.

Persona 3 FES and Persona 4. JRPG's released for the PS2 that offer compelling characters and stories. Related to Catherine in the PS3/Xbox 360 list, as they come from the same developer and have some in-universe crossover.",best game console
