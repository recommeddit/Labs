17832,best Kardashian,So often I write Khlie instead of Khloe and sometimes I'm tempted to not correct it üòÇ.
59897,best perfume,"Nearly everything from Juliette Has A Gun but my fav from them right now is ""Lady Vengeance"""
38231,best newspapers to read,"This is very true, and I would never encourage someone to get their news from just one source. But an acknolwedged curation bias is, to me, less of a problem than bias in reporting, particularly an unacknowledged bias."
42565,best detective show,Bosch!!!
52838,best hiphop album,"This the one i agree with the most

I'd add

2Pac - Me Against the World"
6377,best Netflix documentary,shoah
34617,best NFL player,"If you wanted to build a case around championships, I think there's a coherent case that could be made for Otto Graham. I doubt it would convince anyone, and you have to consider the AAFC + NFL stats or else you only have six NFL seasons.... but highest career winning percentage by a QB, 10 championship appearances and 7 wins + 5 MVPs in a ten year career, and still owning the record for highest career yards per attempt is an interesting foundation to try to stand a case on. Did *Brady* win a pro basketball championship? I thought not."
69538,best major to study in college,"Our courses are much more focussed though, where you have to take on liberal arts classes we dive right into the sciences."
72701,best wireless lightweight mouse,Damn dude I hope whatever‚Äôs wrong gets better. Tomorrow‚Äôs another day.
27483,best bollywood actor,"Dr Rajkumar from kannada movies.


No contest, guy can act & sing like an angel."
66586,best soccer team in the world,"My dad is a Manc and and I fondly remember him nearly giving my dog a heart attack when Solskjaer scored. While me and my brother (both Liverpool fans) just sat there thinking ""of course they've fucking done this, bastards."""
14118,best place to get free books,Mirror?
7472,best laptop for general use,"Ah sorry for the delay! My laptop have no fully died. We're gonna try replacing the battery and the charger. So, instead of a laptop, I'm thinking of a gaming PC instead. Do you have a list for that?"
5888,best programming language for web development,I learnt the front end languages and now I'm learning php but I saw that php woudnt be that worthy to learn and useful in the future so I don't really know what back-end language is better to learn nowadays or Not. Maybe python would be also a great choice as it can be useful for so many things other than web development itself. Any suggestion?
32743,best vacation resort,"I unironically loved Vegas too, but ditto Venice (one of the few places I've visited more than once), I just don't get how they can be compared in any meaningful way."
25681,best cricket teams of all time,The Australian team hold the record for most consecutive test matches without a loss though. A record they achieved and then followed up to equal soon after.
12038,best gifts for dad,just find a girl whose dad collects collections.
11313,best gifts for dad,I agree with your sentiment entirely. Especially about divorcing for the kids' sake.
24542,best anime,"It's pretty good, although the ending's controversial: some love it, some hate it. I do think it has amazing characters and it delivers well on the themes it presents. Plus it's pretty suspenseful and can have you on the edge of your seat at times. I definitely think it's worth checking out."
14582,best romantic novel,Also this sounds great as a fall/Halloween read!
43225,best detective show,Mindhunter on Netflix is good. Season 2 just came out.
37740,best Marvel movie,"* Best: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, GOTG 1 & 2, Infinity War and Endgame.
* Worst: Iron Man 2 *(it‚Äôs a rushed mess of a script)*, The Incredible Hulk and Thor: The Dark Thor *(they‚Äôre both ehh)*.

‚Ä¶but it says a great deal about the consistency of the MCU that the ‚Äúworst‚Äù films are still *eminently* watchable. There‚Äôs not a BvS or Green Lantern among them."
10085,best pencil for drawing,"I like the Blick Studio drawing pencils. The quality is good, but what I really appreciate is that they print the hardness on ALL SIDES so it's always immediately obvious which pencil is which. I can't tell you how much time and aggravation this has saved me."
56499,best desktop monitor,"In the 16/9 d√©partement, the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX. It'll release this year after much delay, and will be $3000.
It will be the best of the best, yet still far from perfect."
21680,best winnie the pooh comic,because the echo yells before piglet
