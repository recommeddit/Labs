38271,"What's your point? The only thing British about the organization is the fact that they are based out of London. The Economist doesn't even remotely limit itself to British topics. It is a global company. They cover anything and everything that the magazine finds important. In fact, in their most recent magazine, their was little, if any, mention of Britain. The latest edition talked about artificial intelligence, financial technology (FinTech), war in Syria, Germany's influence and dominance in Europe, Danish politics, Italy's constitutional reform, global warming and its relation to our current weather experiences, internet firm acquisitions and dominance by major players, manufacturing in America, anti-bribery business, Indonesia's new president and their thoughts on how he will impact their economy and future, progress in behavioral economics, Saudi Arabia's stock market and its opening to foreign investment, international bond markets, banks thinning their retail branch networks around the world, the relationship between ageing and inflation in Japan's economy, America's Navy and their plans for electrically powered superguns, a bunch of science topics and research recognition, the evolution of music, the future of museums in America, myths surrounding American history and the founding fathers, book reviews, financial data... 

The company covers American topics more than it covers British topics.",best newspapers to read

Love this case.  I've dropped my phone multiple times.  And it's still perfectly fine.  That's being dropped on concrete, asphalt, rocks, dirt etc.  working in my field I need a case that's not too big and bulky but also protect wells.  This case is slim and stream line and feels like it's built like a tank.  When you put it on you can be worry free about drops because when it does drop it makes a completely different sound from any other case I've heard.  The sound of protection.

No cringing or winces when you see it falling to the floor in slow motion.

62410,"Genuinely curious as to why you have listed Nioh as an Action RPG, whereas Nier as a ""game with RPG elements""?

Aside from visual appearance of armor, I can't see any world where Nioh has more RPG traits than Nier... again, just curious as to your thought process, not trying to start a feud. 

Having that all been said, I'd absolutely list Horizon Zero Dawn under your games with RPG elements category!

Tom Holland's Spider-Man takes a lot of the Ultimate Spider-Man-runs with Peter and Miles, which shows a more modern look on the life of a high schooling superhero. So I think the MCU-MJ somehow really fits in as Ultimate MJ.",best spiderman actor
