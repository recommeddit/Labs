I highly recommend the ""From Manhattan With Love"" series. There's three full books in it, and a couple of mini books. Each book is about a focussed on a different girl in a group of friends.

16723,"I’ve owned hamsters, rats, and a mouse, and out of those, the mouse was my favorite. He was intelligent, curious, and friendly. Hamsters are cute but not very intelligent. Rats and mice are much smarter. Temperament is really important with rats, because rat bites can be very painful (my roommate chose a neurotic rat. Mine was perfectly fine). Mice are more fragile, so I wouldn’t recommend them for young children. The big downside with rodents is cleaning their cages - it can get old after a while.

One thing that’s important to look at is lifespan - some small animals live much longer than others. Mice, hamsters, and rats have fairly short lifespans (2-3 years, usually). Snakes can live 20 years or more. I think guinea pigs are 8-10 years?",best pet for toddlers

30852,"> the Dutch language is extremely hard

Though if you know other Germanic languages, it's not really all that difficult to pick up. I can understand a relatively big portion of Dutch texts based on just my knowledge of Swedish, German and English. 

It's the pronunciation that's tricky. Fucking g sounds, man. And sometimes R's are rolled, sometimes not, depending on what part of the country you're from. Personally I like Flemish the most.",best country to live in

For arcade, I actually really enjoyed the 2016 Need for Speed game. It got a lot of ridicule for its console release lacking manual transmission, but the PC release has that, along with 4k and 144hz support. It's a fun arcade racer with arcade physics and a shit ton of upgrades you can do to your car. I'm running a 1000hp aventador with drift tires right now lmao. I also heard that Forza Horizon 3 is pretty good, but they don't support my wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) because of the logo on the front.",best car racing video game
