57976,best cologne,"My husband wears Burberry Brit I think, I love it!"
15019,best romantic novel,"Sarah Morgan!!!!

I highly recommend the ""From Manhattan With Love"" series. There's three full books in it, and a couple of mini books. Each book is about a focussed on a different girl in a group of friends. 

When you're done with them there's two more series' and the characters between all three series' are kinda connected which is quite nice."
22420,best celebrity,">Seemed to believe she ranked just under The Queen in social standing. In actuality she ranks just under the drummer in the third best Queen cover band in Slough.

Haha fantastic

Stephen Fry is a genuine national treasure."
16723,best pet for toddlers,"I’ve owned hamsters, rats, and a mouse, and out of those, the mouse was my favorite. He was intelligent, curious, and friendly. Hamsters are cute but not very intelligent. Rats and mice are much smarter. Temperament is really important with rats, because rat bites can be very painful (my roommate chose a neurotic rat. Mine was perfectly fine). Mice are more fragile, so I wouldn’t recommend them for young children. The big downside with rodents is cleaning their cages - it can get old after a while.

One thing that’s important to look at is lifespan - some small animals live much longer than others. Mice, hamsters, and rats have fairly short lifespans (2-3 years, usually). Snakes can live 20 years or more. I think guinea pigs are 8-10 years?"
26640,best board games,"I asked the wifey the same question and she came up with:

**Carcassonne** (she said immediately)

**Sushi Go! Party**

**Survive! Escape From Atlantis** -- not a cooperative game, but good clean fun (killing your friends)

**Catan** (No bells and whistles, just the base set)

She agree"

but ... eeew :(

Honestly you're better off just biting the bullet on a new battery. You probably know this already though: Cheapest place is ebay. They are usually easy to fit. Messing about with software can only give you diminishing gains."

33249,best electric car,"That’s the thing! I’m not a truck person or a Ford person. I never thought I would even consider it. 

My solar array has a battery so bidirectional charging is less of a perk although still cool! Being able to power a camper or job site though is amazing."
55659,best action and adventure novel series,"Came here to say this.  Richard Morgan does it better, imho, but if you want a rip-roaring evil aliens vs. military imperialists then he's your man.  No brains required, though."
59872,best perfume,Fantasy by Britney Spears
30852,best country to live in,"> the Dutch language is extremely hard

Though if you know other Germanic languages, it's not really all that difficult to pick up. I can understand a relatively big portion of Dutch texts based on just my knowledge of Swedish, German and English. 

It's the pronunciation that's tricky. Fucking g sounds, man. And sometimes R's are rolled, sometimes not, depending on what part of the country you're from. Personally I like Flemish the most."
42978,best detective show,"True Detective and Sharp Objects, crime/suspenseful dramas on HBO. They’re both incredible!"
23345,best car racing video game,"For simulation, Dirt Rally and Asetto Corsa haven't really been beaten yet.
For arcade, I actually really enjoyed the 2016 Need for Speed game. It got a lot of ridicule for its console release lacking manual transmission, but the PC release has that, along with 4k and 144hz support. It's a fun arcade racer with arcade physics and a shit ton of upgrades you can do to your car. I'm running a 1000hp aventador with drift tires right now lmao. I also heard that Forza Horizon 3 is pretty good, but they don't support my wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) because of the logo on the front."
