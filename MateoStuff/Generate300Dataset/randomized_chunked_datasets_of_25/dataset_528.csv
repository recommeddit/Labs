16379,best sunglasses for fashion,"The air force museum sells the actual aviator sunglasses for a reasonable price(~$80). If you are gonna get aviators, why not go with the real deal.

40495,best midrange GPU,I see absolutely nothing wrong with somebody picking up a hobby on the cheap. But I do get your point on stop having unreasonable expectations. but you can get a way lower end graphics card then a 2080 as listed and still be perfectly happy. Not everyone is wanting the best of the best just to play a game on a computer once in a while.
30921,best country to live in,"Now listen here cunt, I am a fair dinkum aussie and this place is so fucked its a joke. For starters, the sheilas are fucking filthy mate. Not a single on has any fucking decency and if you find one that does, they're either foreign or have autism. 

Our uni's are fucking ripper and we dont pay a cent for them until we're thirty and well paid, but bloody good fucking luck getting to one because the housing around them will tear you a new asshole because the landlords all think we're foreign and literally shit cash.

Let's say you dont want to live in the city, like I used to - well you better fucking be immune to all snake bites, be 6' 4"" to fight off a big red, and know exactly where to poke a fucking drop bear when they descend from trees. There are also more spiders here than that filthy nest in the second harry potter.

Finally mate, if you can't smash at least 24 VB tinnies dont even bother. First because no one respects fucking light weights, and second because piss is so bloody expensive you need to take out a mortgage at our just as expensive banks to buy it in smaller quantities than a slab.

If you move here and make it to sundy, let me know how you did it cunt."

39140,best web browser,IIRC google donated 500 mil to the mozilla foundation. I wouldn't be so sure they aren't ganking your info. That being said...superior browser
37490,best amusement park,I’m going to say UNIVERSAL JAPAN because they have without a doubt they best hogsmead and best forbidden journey. They also added flying dinosaur making it a must visit for enthusiasts. I just think this is a great park and definitely has a contender to be the best theme park of the decade.
68612,best science fiction novel,"That book is an amazing little gem! However, it had weird effects in my psyche and at least one other friend back when we read it in our teens.  I don't know what it does and how it does it, but we both had very vivid dreams and a constant sense of dread for days after reading it."
38755,best web browser,"Firefox if you're wanting to move away from Chromium. But it's also fast, reliable and customisable."

34072,best NFL player,"Not even the best receiver. Time to bone up on your NFL history, guys, because [Don Hutson](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HutsDo00.htm) was better than Rice.

In 1942 Hutson led the league in receptions with 74. Pop Ivy was second with 27. Hutson's 1211 receiving yards also led the league. Ray McLean was second with 571. Did I mention that he led in receiving touchdowns (17-8)? Points scored (138-54)? Yards from scrimmage (1215-758)?

And surely we haven't forgotten that his seven interceptions were only one fewer than the league lead. 

EDIT: Wow. I didn't realize I would strike such a nerve. I thought my dissent was reasonable, at least."
2296,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,This man knows good pizza.

47379,best state to visit in the United States,"One piece of advice I would give is to go to a college football game rather than an NFL game. Large colleges have bigger and louder stadiums than their NFL counterparts (8 college teams have stadiums larger than 100,000). Lots of the colleges have bars nearby, tailgating on the college campus, etc. For a lot of people, it's an all-weekend event. In most of the south and large parts of Texas and the Midwest, people care more about college football than the NFL.

If you don't want to go to LA, you might consider going to San Diego to get some SoCal sunshine. It's a little more manageable in terms of size. If you want to see some of the country's historic side, check out Charleston and Savannah, as well as some small New England towns. Boston is probably our most historic big city.

My number one recommendation would be to go out west and check out the great outdoors. Our cities can be interesting, but probably not as interesting as the ones in Europe. However, there's nothing in Europe remotely close to the desert landscapes of the southwest, the enormity of the Rockies, or just the wide open expanses found across the country. I've been to Rocky Mountain, Mount Rainier, and Big Bend national parks, but you really can't go wrong with any of the parks out west."
29176,best web hosting service,"I mean, it’s normal. I think most web host providers do the same thing? Like, Hostinger are offering a 90% discount at the moment but it’s for a limited time. Do you really think they’d let you use their services at 90% discount the whole time?"
73671,best battery bank,i have an anker nano and its a fantastic little charger. would even consider carrying 2 instead of one large double port charger for those who want to charge multiple things at once
71226,best movies with a cool twist,The /s was too late for me not to sit up straight.
25863,best cricket teams of all time,Only 3 matches in the 1870s?
418,best terminal file manager reddit,I currently use dolphin (kind of) but only for opening appimages. Every single other need you could have for a file manager is achieved faster with just the terminal.
