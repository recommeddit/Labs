24854,best spiderman actor,"The Marc Webb movies borrow some of the better story elements from the early 2000s run of Ultimate comics; primarily Oscorp being at the center of everything and “Venom” being developed by Richard Parker instead of simply being an alien from outer space. Although those were fun ideas, Bendis had a great deal of terrible concepts as well (e.g. Norman Osborne literally transforms into a green goblin, Carnage is a mindless clone of Richard Parker, Mary-Jane is Peter’s first and only girlfriend).

I identified with Andrew Garfield’s take on the character as an outsider. I could relate to Tobey Maquire’s quiet nature, but Tom Holland just feels a little too Disney."
28955,best breakfast foods,"Have you had Pillsbury frozen biscuits? If not, you should."
3513,best college for research,"They do. Also, since I will be a full pay student, their student debt metric while very important for other students, really doesn't work in my case."
48503,best color to paint with,The Behr app works pretty well for visualizing different colors in the rooms in your house ... but their colors are waaaay off on the app vs. the paint chips at Home Depot (even the actual website is better than the app). So that's pretty disappointing.
3105,best webcamera,"It's because people want the wrong things.

If you want a good webcam, you want good optics, and get a bigger, deeper camera. Make that, though, and you get people complaining it's too big/fat."
23634,best car racing video game,I was also surprised the the effects of tuning the cars. Changing the gear ratios for tracks with longer/shorter straights. And changing the differential to allow it to get loose around the corners if desired
61932,Best RPG game on PS4,"Divinity Original Sin 1 and especially 2

Nier Automata

Persona 5

Dragon Quest XI"
18161,best YouTube video,"This fucking video. 

A few years ago, my mother, little brother, and I were playing with our new Chromecast. Family bonding, ya know? We were just hanging out, streaming a random playlist of stupid videos to the living room TV. Everything is going great..And then this fucking woman comes up on. 

I’ll never forget the look on my poor mother’s face. Right below the cross on the wall, a woman was grapefruiting a fucking giant dildo. Worse, it was in surround sound. 

All hell broke loose. Suddenly, my mother is screaming, demanding I turn it off. Little brother is in shock, but begging me to keep playing it. I’m laughing so hard, I start crying and can’t figure out how to shut it off. 

Yeah, so, Chromecast time ended after that. My mom is still convinced I did it on purpose. Worth it though."
7375,best laptop for general use,"Im trying to decide between the zenbook 14 with ryzen 7 5700u or Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro 16"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5800H - 120Hz QHD. I already have a pc that i game on so itll just be for consuming content like YouTube and trading stocks lol. Id like good battery life and for it to be somewhat portable."
11277,best gifts for dad,"This is how I try to do it. Daughter says ""daddy come look at this!"", I think about how tired I am and who fucking cares, then I think there is only one shot. The kids are growing up and need their daddy to look at something. I'll look at it. If only because Chris Rock said the goal is to keep your daughter off the pole. That is my main motivation."
15311,best tree for the garden,"Any tree that is not a pecan tree.
