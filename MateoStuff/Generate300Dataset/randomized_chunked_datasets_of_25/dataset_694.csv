24854,"The Marc Webb movies borrow some of the better story elements from the early 2000s run of Ultimate comics; primarily Oscorp being at the center of everything and “Venom” being developed by Richard Parker instead of simply being an alien from outer space. Although those were fun ideas, Bendis had a great deal of terrible concepts as well (e.g. Norman Osborne literally transforms into a green goblin, Carnage is a mindless clone of Richard Parker, Mary-Jane is Peter’s first and only girlfriend).

I identified with Andrew Garfield’s take on the character as an outsider. I could relate to Tobey Maquire’s quiet nature, but Tom Holland just feels a little too Disney.",best spiderman actor

18161,"This fucking video. 

A few years ago, my mother, little brother, and I were playing with our new Chromecast. Family bonding, ya know? We were just hanging out, streaming a random playlist of stupid videos to the living room TV. Everything is going great..And then this fucking woman comes up on. 

I’ll never forget the look on my poor mother’s face. Right below the cross on the wall, a woman was grapefruiting a fucking giant dildo. Worse, it was in surround sound. 

All hell broke loose. Suddenly, my mother is screaming, demanding I turn it off. Little brother is in shock, but begging me to keep playing it. I’m laughing so hard, I start crying and can’t figure out how to shut it off. 

Yeah, so, Chromecast time ended after that. My mom is still convinced I did it on purpose. Worth it though.",best YouTube video
