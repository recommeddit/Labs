12878,best gifts for mom,"I'm saving the shit out of this on the possibility that in ten to fifteen years, I have kids and am still married to their mother."
54160,best medicine for a cold,It is in Canada :)
58262,best cologne,Hard earned man musk.
56369,best desktop monitor,"Same here, bought the alienware but its been a month same time as my PC, but no news since then from Dell -_-"
3209,best webcamera,"I don't remember the exact reviews, but I looked up ones that just gave the two cameras side by side at varying levels of ambient light and made my decision from there."
66145,best soccer team in the world,"Yeah, more than my club ever did in any case :P"

2401,best headphones,"[Audio Technica ATH-M50x](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/99aff89488ddd6b1/)

Over ear professional studio monitors. 

[Here they are being used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZweyIKNwX4) in Paramores music video."
44449,best items under $100,I’m surprised you didn’t scare yourself straight after hearing the loud sound you made
49031,best gaming monitor,I have two LG27GL850 as I was pretty set on getting an IPS monitor with a low refresh rate. I may be biased because I'm upgrading from 1080p 60hz but It feels like I'm seeing clearly for the first time. I've had no complaints with the monitors. They're absolutely gorgeous.
37953,best Marvel movie,"My personal ratings aside, I'm really surprised IW has such a low rating compared to Endgame. I'd understand if it was a fan rating, but it shocks me that critics liked Endgame more. Infinity War is a cleaner movie with a tighter plot and I think it stands on its own a lot better than Endgame does. It balanced characters a lot better as well; for as good as Endgame was, it had a lot more problems than a lot of the best Marvel films. Endgame is 3 hours of fan service and payoffs to other films, and from the ratings on other films I would think critics wouldn't like that."
60868,Best comedy show on Netflix,Ari Shaffir! He's a total asshole but somehow still charming.
24214,best anime,"I assumed Clannad being in there meant it included After Story, but the fact that After Story is not in the top 100 but Clannad is makes me question these ""experts"""
36387,best alcoholic drink,Cider any from the fridge
34611,best NFL player,"Rice had an argument that countered the QB narrative by his longevity. At 40 he was still a good to great receiver. Brady has now taken the longevity crown as well. Rice should have been 2, and there was still a sliver of an argument that the gap between Rice and the next best WR is significantly more than Brady and the next best QB. 

/s Also they had to put Brady at 1 or he'll play for another 10 years."
14764,best romantic novel,"I thought the plot was excellent, but I just couldn't enjoy the writing :("
17417,best iOS game,"If you at least mildly loved Xenowerk, you should buy Space Marshalls, they are lots of fun!"

White Russian when I'm home (watching the Big Lebowski)"
57660,best cologne,This is really helpful! Can you please tell me what the difference is between Prada L'Homme and YSL L'Homme?
15447,best tree for the garden,"I'm pretty fond of the Tree of Life.  It's immensely useful in understating in what way all living things on the planet are related to each other and how closely or distantly.

More people need to understand those relationships between the species on this planet."
13149,best gifts for mom,"Well, it depends on age.... but older women seem to like those capes that are out now.  Scarves work, also if there are grandkids anything with their face on it ( think Shutterfly stuff ).  My mom loves when I make calendars with the pics of grandkid."
43642,best items under $100,"The right shampoo and conditioner. Am dude.

I use this super girly looking stuff called love beauty and planet, and my hair is glorious and I love putting my hands into it. And other people like putting their hands in my hair too. Generally women.

Female marketed products are vastly superior in so many ways, and dudes won't buy it because they're forced into the men's marketed section with bears and wolves and trees that represent shitty college smelling products that are 12-in-1 body/hair/dish/clothes/car wash. 

Hair is hair. Choose the products marketed towards people who give a shit about their hair. Be the beautiful man you were meant to be.

Edit: that is a ton of comments. I'm gonna try to get to them later, but for those who want to know, [this is my shampoo](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/shampoo/sulfate-free-argan-oil-&-lavender-shampoo.html) and [this is my conditioner](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/conditioner/argan-oil-&-lavender-conditioner.html). I used to use Aussie brand conditioner, which did decent things, but felt oily.

Edit2: I have straight hair, but have found r/curlygirl to have great resources. Sulphate free shampoo if where it's at.

Edit3: I'm seeing a TON of people recommend Mane and Tail. I'm sorely tempted to try it after reading all these...

Edit4: Holy shit, apparently there's an 18-in-1 soap. And I thought 12-in-1 was absurd. The kind redditor u/Gilthoniel_Elbereth has put forward https://www.drbronner.com/ for your consideration."
