"Obligatory not a dentist, but I cannot stress how well the waterpik works, especially when filled with listerine. Use twice a day or whenever something feels stuck in my teeth. Went from lots of pockets in my gums and random soreness to none and no bleeding during cleanings. Can definitely tell the difference if I go away on vacation for a week without it... So I got a portable one as well.

"I replaced Firefox with OperaGX. For some reason Firefox kept eating my RAM (memory leak) if I left if running for a while which is very annoying. With OperaGX, I can limit memory usage and I never experienced any memory leaks."

"Hey!  I'm really looking for a pad that has a bit more speed than my Corsair MP510.  I've loved my Corsair but being that I have the XL desk version, I'm annoyed by how difficult it has become to clean.  The mousepad is a nuisance and has collected so many flecks of dust that negatively affect my gameplay.

&#x200B;

SO... I'm thinking of making the switch to Artisan, specifically the Hien XL Soft.  It's a bit speedier (according to Hoya) so that's the major reason. My questions for you:

1. Is this a good transition if I'm looking for a slightly speedier, easy to clean, long lasting pad?
2. What's the website to order for the US? The Hien Soft XL is in backorder. How often will they come back in stock?"
I'm pretty sure that's just the German cure for everything.
"I'm planning on going to law school at the university where I'm getting my undergrad. One of their recommended degrees is Letters, which is a combination of history, English, and philosophy with both modern and ancient languages thrown in for fun. I'm also doing a political science minor. Seriously....don't do a poly sci major if you want to go to college. It doesn't teach the logic or technical writing skills needed to succeed on the LSAT or in law school."
"California Adventure, while it got much better, had some misses though too. Pixar Pier honestly is a huge dud in my eyes. Comparing that section of the park to what Imagineering should be aspiring to just leaves me sad on the inside."
