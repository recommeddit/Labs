15657,"[Gamma Ray](https://www.amazon.com/CHEATERS-Polarized-Wayfarer-Sunglasses-Options/dp/B073XS8YZV?th=1)

~$10 (~$18 for a 3-pack) for surprisingly good build quality and decent looks in a big selection of colors. I have a small face so the fact that they have a 52mm option is great. Shout-out to the Wirecutter for recommending them:

But I think by positioning it as stand up, she was able to place it in front of audiences that wouldn't see it typically. She's a very intelligent performer and I'm quite interested to see where she goes from here.",Best comedy show on Netflix

I'm so fed up with doctors thinking this isnt real and giving him these drugs. He was discharged from the ER once after giving him a drug with amoxicillin in it and I had a fit. The stupid asshole told me ""he hasnt thrown up yet, plus no ones allergic to amoxicillin like that"" - guess who got violently ill in the parking lot!!

Before Spider-Man, superhero movies were really just silly Batman movies and we judged them as such. Raimi's Spider-Man was the beginning of a Thing in the sense that everyone could take it seriously.
