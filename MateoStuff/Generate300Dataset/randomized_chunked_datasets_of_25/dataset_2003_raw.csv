"Although you have mentioned a couple of hosts, I can see you have nicely put the name JustVPS. And credit goes to you that I opened their site and saw their plans that sound quite interesting to me. Maybe I can test their service as well and then share with you my feedback here."

axios is the fcking bomb. every time i try to use `fetch` like a brave man i get burned by some stupid api snafu or other. axios would have saved me days of my life.
This battery is really good.  I use it for about a year.  You can find reviews on it: https://youtu.be/Did2ZZVT5_k
I heard Twister is running great this year. Have not been yet personally
"Yeah they’ve got hella bball talent (RIP Dragen Petrovic btw...guy was gonna be an all time hall of famer). The Joker and Luka obv, my guy goran dragic, Nurkic, Poku, Bjelica, both Bogdanovic’s, Saric, Zubac, mirotic, this young kid named Jovic who’s supposed to be good, etc."
"I live there, yes racism/immigration exists. But the greatest of all pains: the language. Even tough we speak english on an okay-level, the Dutch language is extremely hard. Also, prepare for rain."
"When I was at tech, my ti nspire was not allowed for math classes (or most math based classes for that matter).  Most people bring a TI-89 and a basic calculator for calc tests"
"Jason Momoa. He’s an absolute treasure to be around. He’s genuine and loves his job. He wants his fans to have as much fun as he’s having. He can size up a fan and know how far to push/tease them to make them comfortable while not going too far. His personality is infectious, and I had a blast with him."

I heard that chrome takes up a lot of space or something? Or that it makes your computer run slower
"I second this, browns are also my favorite. But again, it's all preference."
I want so badly for you to be wrong because Venom was my favorite vilian when I was a kid. But you're most likely correct. I'm keeping a VERY cautious optimism about that movie.

"If I have the time to make them, these days it's usually sweet potato hash browns (shredded sw. pot. & onion, cooked in bacon/coconut oil/both). If I'm feeling indulgent, I then add some eggs & cream and make it into a frying-pan-quiche. Sweet potato w/ egg is surprisingly good."
Toby was a 30 year old playing a teenager. Andrew looked too good to be Peter Parker. Ain't shit wrong with Tom though. He's the perfect fit for Peter Parker and Spiderman.
"Just buy a better one. I got one from lenovo for about $38 CAD and its great. Prices became inflated and the market flooded due to covid. 

Also the reddragon one amazon is decent too (but lenovo is better for the price)"
"No. 4 days after being limited, they allowed fill rate again, it lasted 3 days, then it stopped. Now is filling ads again since 2-3 days. I didn’t do anything, all happened automatically. Hope this time will stick and the warning will go away."
"My husband got me an iPad for a combo Mother's Day/ birthday present when our daughter was a month old. If the iPad Mini had been available then, that would have actually have been better! It was a great gift. I loved reading on the Kindle app while I was nursing. Now that my daughter is 2.5, she actually uses it and it helps when I need to distract her and get something done. 

Even better than a cleaning service gift certificate is to actually book it. Sometimes it's the little things - like making a phone call to schedule a time to clean that can feel like a huge hurdle to get past in those early days of motherhood."
are you serious?
Oh shit dude I've never heard of this. Just put it on and he's so smooth. His flow is butter like guru but more inside the pocket. Thank you for the heads up on this lmao
