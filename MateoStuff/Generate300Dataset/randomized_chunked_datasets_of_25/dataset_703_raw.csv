"If you truly feel this way, then it probably means you didn't have the right packages installed on Sublime."
"I *think* it was 2018, but one of the big announcement articles for an award like the Hugos and what books had won was all about the gender of the winners and how great it was that women were crushing men at last. It was so devoted to this, in fact, that not a single entry about the winners actually talked about the books that won.

Several failed to even *name the winning book*. But there was plenty about oppression!

There was a minimum bar there, and they missed it."
Unless you're Italy of course.
"I thought the Turkish people would be all over this thread. but nope, as always, Turkish people are nowhere to be found on Reddit.

"The sex scenes were decent smut but by the second one it was kind of  annoying how formulaic the conquests were. 

Scene 1: Mindless, animal sex with character who is, or may be, antagonist or character has no emotional relationship with

Scene 2: More emotional sex before final battle that character has been slowly growing closer to and has emotional connection with"
"I got my grandpa one of those ""[college name] Grandpa"" mugs, and when he passed away, I got it back. It was so well used the colors of the design were faded where he held it. I think of him every time I use it (and try to hold it the way he did). Miss him so."

Try to ride the parachute tower! It’s the last one of them in the US and maybe the world!
I’m worried what you just heard was give me a lot of bacon and eggs. What I said was give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
I don't really like Arrowhead or Crystal Geyser

Anybody been to BGW’s Halloween event? Considering going this year but curious how it is. I’ve only ever been to Halloweekends at Cedar Point and it was a blast.
"Reddit has a built in dark theme, but I acknowledge the ease of having it automatically."
I use neovim for everything. It's basically vim but with better default settings and it feels faster (could be placebo though).
tbh anyone who owns a remotely decent PC has no reason to get an Xbox. Unlike with Playstation and switch.
C'MON!
"Suggestion for another Advanced distro: Linux From Scratch.  You better know what you're doing in Linux to be able to install a whole new system from source.  Fortunately they've got a (nearly) step-by-step book to take you through the whole process.  Any troubleshooting, of course, is on the person installing it."

"The problem is there is *always* a perspective. What to cover, from where to focalize a story, who to interview about it, and so on are part of the message being broadcast. 

To make up a hypothetical situation, a national news outlet might run daily stories that center around malpractice by dentists. The story would be told from the point of view of the disgruntled patient. The patient and his or her family members would be interviewed. An editorial or an anchor might pose the question, ""is there a serious problem with our dental practices?"" All the coverage might be accurate, and since this particular news org covers a nation of hundreds of millions of people, they have no problem finding plentiful cases of dental malpractice: they exist, but might be statistically irrelevant. Doubtless, many viewers of this news program would come to be unreasonably suspicious and wary of dentists, despite 100% accurate coverage."
It is a total mystery
"My dad was a dentist. We used Crest because Crest gave us enormous amounts of toothpaste for free. Like big cardboard boxes of a million tiny Crest tubes.

But as my dad would say, ""it doesn't matter, just make sure you floss, [long comma,] you [bleep].""
