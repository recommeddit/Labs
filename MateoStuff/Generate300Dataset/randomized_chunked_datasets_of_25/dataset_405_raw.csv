Dude that song doesn't clip at all. Intentional distortion is not the same as clipping. Not everything with electric guitars or fuzz is mistakenly compressed.

"I think it depends on the water in your home. I have a well and I have a water softener and a filter to keep silt out of the softener. The water has been analyzed and is completely safe for what matters. The softener is there because of calcium which basically eats fixtures and makes soap not work properly. 

Most municipalities have clean water which is carefully monitored (and more regulated than bottled water). Of course, mistakes happen. The major danger would be from bacteria, which usually are not removed by a filter though you can get systems which do kill bacteria. 

Some people find the taste of water (well or otherwise) disagreeable and in these cases, depending on the cause, filters help.

That being said, for the most part, most Britta water filters don't really do much good for most people."
"F1 2020! You can create your own team, which you will start with a slow car competing against the slowest teams, and it allows you to dive deep into upgrading your facilities and car upgrades. Slowly over time, you can see your race results improve, and my oh my does it feel good to finally get your first podium (top 3 finish). The physics is super well done, too. At first, I had no desire to play an F1 game because why would I only want to race with the same type of cars? But once you play it and see how fast these cars go around the most insane circuits in the world you understand how much fun it is to play this game. I have started 2 different teams, 3 different drivers, and played the heck out of online. I use a Logitech G920 racing wheel and it is so much fun. If you enjoy simulation racing and want a game that will start you off with crap equipment and slow cars, this is the game for you. Even the slowest Formula 1 car is still one of the fastest cars on the planet.

P.S. F1 2019 and earlier do NOT have MyTeam in the game. Just a heads up.

TLDR: F1 2020 is a 10/10 game for someone looking for a racing game that makes you grind to get a faster car. And not a bad type of hours upon hours grind either."
I’m curious why Khloe is first considering she’s not very liked at the moment.
"Anker. Top notch product quality. They make a 3m cable I believe. I have like 8 of their cables around the house.

I don't recommend aukey however, the first c to c cable I bought from them was not usb c compliant."
Abe Lincoln. He lives up to the hype.
You welcome.
"A friend of mine works for a small luxurious hotel in London.  
He told me the  concerge system there is absolutely absurd. Money buys everything.

Anything the clients want, clients get. They are told never to say no, worst case they say ""I don't think this is really appropriate""

Obviously drugs and escorts are a classic. He showed me 20 phone numbers of drug dealers in his phone to be able to get whatever drugs to the customers (he never buys  though, only gets people in contact).

And for harder tasks, he goes through professional concierges who charge A LOT.

\- You want a new Prada dress at 2AM for the party you are about to  attend? Sure thing, let's wake a few people up, charge triple the price and split the benefit between people involved. Have a good night madam.

\- You want tickets for the Wimbledon final that takes place tomorrow? You have £20k? Enjoy the game, sir.

But in some cases, they can't satisfy the customer. So when a couple of clients came back drunk asking him to have sex with the wife while the husband was watching and filming, he felt like it was a good time to say     ""I don't think this is really appropriate""."
"I mean Spielberg has a great track record. If anybody can make a great 5th installment..it’s him. 

Sure, Indy 4 is the weakest of the franchise. But it still has a 78% approval rating which is a lot higher than a lot of modern blockbusters. Plus, they can learn from it. Rocky 5 was terrible, but then we got Rocky Balboa and the Creed films for example."

"I went through the Redux lessons on FreeCodeCamp and was totally lost, but then I went through Grider's course (as a newbie) and it made sense. I thought his insurance company analogy was fantastic"
"Dude, that's actually really unhealthy. Go brush your teeth man."

"The year mom became a grandma, my sisters and I decided to get mom a custom grandma mug.  She used that mug every day until it broke this year.  We’re replacing it for her for Christmas this year, and I think she’ll be really happy with the new design."
"My group played both many times and generally liked Avalon better. The main difference is that instead of special cards providing extra knowledge, there are special good and evil *roles* that come with special knowledge from the beginning -- so you have to try to convey your knowledge subtly to your comrades. Having an interesting permanent identity feels more organic to me."
its on you. for me its not worth
I have one of the symmetry Star Wars cases and I’m genuinely sad I’ll have to stop using it when my new phone comes in - it’s gorgeous.

Em as a whole from Infinite to TES is top 3/GOAT material.
Probably for the hotel dog as well!
"If I can offer 4/5, I really like Fjallraven's Kanken backpack. They're a little on the pricy side, but extremely durable and I personally find them really cute once customized (I can upload a picture of mine if you're at all curious). They were originally designed for comfort and fixing the back problems of Swedish elementary school kids, then eventually they did adult backpacks as well. They have a special strap design that helps spread the weight of the bag over your back so it helps discomfort. I have scoliosis so most backpacks hurt my back really badly, this one barely at all."
