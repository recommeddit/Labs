49511,BenQ EX2510 if you want accurate colors and AOC 24G2 if you want more vibrant colors. They're both really fast. ViewSonic XG2405 is also great if you want slightly deeper blacks and vibrant colors but it's a bit slower. Avoid XL2411K and XL2411P. They have terrible picture quality and are only good if all you do is play CS:GO with backlight strobing.,best gaming monitor

5706,"HTML CSS JS, definitely learn those first, no doubt about it. I'd hold off on MySQL, you _might_ not end up using it depending on your spin. _After_ learning the 3:

1. Wordpress.  A quick-n-easy path to cash, highly recommended. If you go this route, learn MySQL. You code less in WP (unless you're a themer =  CSS); you build more through it's web interface. So if you're more for getting sites out the door in minimal effort, go this route.
1. Angular. If you enjoy coding, give front-end dev a spin per that post (Angular & React are good choices). For this stack, use NodeJS for your server. It's JS, so you don't need to learn new stuff (compared to learning Ruby on Rails), big learning-curve-saver. Use MongoDB as your database, it's the path of least resistance for this stack. You can actually skip glueing everything together and get the whole shebang [here](http://meanjs.org/). Or if you're feeling more experimental, try this [one instead](https://www.meteor.com/). A big benefit of learning Angular or React is you can transfer that knowledge to building mobile apps as well (see [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)).

I personally prefer option 2 (obviously), but I love code. I come from a background of option 1 (actually using Drupal, not Wordpress) and it's really solid for dishing out websites hand over fist (read $$$); but it's pretty boring IMO. All personal preference.",best programming language for web development

55351,"Seriously, this series is utterly enthralling. I began to read it and was totally hooked in the first few pages. The characters are the most 3 dimensional I have ever seen. My wife wanted to watch the TV series on HBO, since she had heard myself and others talking about the books.

I sat with her through the first 10 minutes of the first HBO episode. I then realized the book could NOT be captured on screen. So much of what happens is in the minds of the characters, and there is NO way to translate those thoughts to the TV screen, no matter how good the actor.

I turned the TV off, mid-episode, and said to my wife, ""Trust me. You want to read the books. THEN watch the series.""

My wife does trust me, completely, as I do her. She bought the books and within the hour was glued to her Kindle. And she understood, within the first chapter, why I stopped the TV show. It is that good. She just caught up to and passed the TV episodes in her reading. It led to some close calls, as spoilers are everywhere it seems, but she made it and is now beyond the TV series. Safe, in other words, from encountering memes or online jokes or posts that are spoilers.

I suggest you stay far away from anything that might be a spoiler, once you actually start reading this series. It is huge and unfinished, but I think any serious reader will enjoy it.

Sorry for all the words. I am feeling a bit like George myself, though he sure tells a much better story than I!",best action and adventure novel series
