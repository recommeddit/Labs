24875,"Well technically the transition from cartoon to reality was first done by Nicholas Hammond. If we're going to give credit for doing it first, it should go to him since he did it 30 years prior. 

But doing it first doesn't earn points in my book, doing it right does. I personally liked Garfield more than Maguire, even though Garfield's Peter Parker isn't the Peter Parker I imagine.  But at least he portrayed a version of Peter Parker that's established (ultimate).  Maguire's Parker didn't feel like any established Peter Parker.  It didn't feel like Peter  Parker at all.  I love Toby Maguire as an actor, but I think his portrayal was by far the worst.  This is coming from someone who thinks Spider-Man 2 is still the best Spider-Man movie(if only by a little bit).

Of course these are just my opinions, I respect yours.",best spiderman actor

They still overheat on the track, though nowhere near as bad as the S, they still can only run full hot laps on very short tracks; which is ok.
