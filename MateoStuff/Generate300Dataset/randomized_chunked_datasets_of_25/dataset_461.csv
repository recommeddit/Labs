24875,best spiderman actor,"Well technically the transition from cartoon to reality was first done by Nicholas Hammond. If we're going to give credit for doing it first, it should go to him since he did it 30 years prior. 

But doing it first doesn't earn points in my book, doing it right does. I personally liked Garfield more than Maguire, even though Garfield's Peter Parker isn't the Peter Parker I imagine.  But at least he portrayed a version of Peter Parker that's established (ultimate).  Maguire's Parker didn't feel like any established Peter Parker.  It didn't feel like Peter  Parker at all.  I love Toby Maguire as an actor, but I think his portrayal was by far the worst.  This is coming from someone who thinks Spider-Man 2 is still the best Spider-Man movie(if only by a little bit).

Of course these are just my opinions, I respect yours."

65440,best phone service company,"Nice, that almost sounds like what T-Mobile was proposing for a prepaid plan if the merger goes through… 2GB and 5GB and they increase 500MB every year for up to 4 years (I think) is what the wording was."

23710,best car racing video game,Oh yeah this also a favorite of mine. It just sucks that I can't play the game properly because I don't have a racing wheel or a controller. Maybe some day...
60666,Best comedy show on Netflix,That would be like watching life from 13 on all over again but I still watch all marathons when I see it
33785,best electric car,"It is ok, certainly nothing special.

They still overheat on the track, though nowhere near as bad as the S, they still can only run full hot laps on very short tracks; which is ok. The 3 is not a sports sedan, it is a mid-grade commuter / family car with some really good acceleration for it's class (Accord, Camry, Maxima, etc.), it is just really expensive for it's class."
18511,best YouTube video,The numa numa kid.
13325,best spreadsheet editor,You cheeky lad!
64278,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"My only concern is the closed DRM system. The android app works for me, but I'll only use them if the want the audibook NOW (and don't care too much about loosing access to it since I'll only listen once, probably.)

I actually buy CDs and rip. Some audibooks come as CD-ROMs with mp3 files, which is also nice."

61360,Best RPG game on PS4,"Its a good game in it's own right, but it is (in my opinion) significantly overshadowed by the other two which are much, much stronger."

73602,best battery bank,"i have not tried to get on a plane, but i use it to power my cpap machine for 3.5 nights when camping. it's cheaper and more powerful than the anker. it gets great reviews also. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FFNTGZ6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_FGB6EbA4X8M0A

9974,best portable charger,"My phone's 4 years old and still going strong (after a battery replacement, of course). I plan to keep using it until it breaks and I can't fix it."
29898,best money managing app,yes and they just bumped their price to $14.99/month or $98.99/year. Kind of ridiculous for a marginally better budget app
