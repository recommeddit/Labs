I think she is trying to let the babyâ€™s learn his scent
Is it anecdotal evidence if everybody has the same anecdote? Every single woman I know goes in for cat food and comes out with $200 less.

9 out of 10 dentists recommend washing your teeth with any toothpaste. The remaining 1 out o 10 is against washing teeth.
"Looking for something good for some gaming (preferably something capable of handling ray tracing, so it doesnâ€™t need replacement soon) that will also be good for programming. Would like a touch screen, mostly because Iâ€™ve never had one.

Battery life and durability are more important than weight.

Not sure what the price range on something like that is. Would like to keep it under $1.5k but my budget is flexible."
"My biggest issue with Mobilism is finding a post for exactly what I am looking for, but the download links will be dead or ""file has expired or the uploader has removed it""."
"I've seen Bill turn down people under 18 on multiple occasions since the tandem fatality.  The site may not be up to date.  Or he's changed his mind and gone back to 16, although most TI's I know there wouldn't risk their rating so they would turn down the student."

Whisky is frontier medicine!
I totally agree with you when it comes to the comic Peter
I just visited Florida recently and I couldnâ€™t stop drinking 30A
Leatherman.
Both the men's and women's version of that smells good.

"Oh yes. This is my ""we are going to have sex"" perfume, LOL"
"I don't understand that sentiment. I loved the first book, but I had to force myself through book 3 after a very mediocre book 2. Katniss spends a large part of the books either in a medical or psychological hallucination while the action happens 'off-screen' and the motivations of the characters often appear tacked-on(but the whole premise is so artificial it's hard to emphasize anyway). I vastly prefer the movies, they are at least over quicker."
"Scrolled down way too much to find this. I used to hate Otterbox because all of their cases were freakin huge. But then I found the Symmetry cases. They offer some good protection while keeping the phone thin and light. Love mine for the XR. 

I actually had my wife pick out one for her new 11. Should be here right after she gets her phone in another week."
"bro i listened to cole album yesterday randomly, but goddam dude has like a 3 song run of sucking his own dick about how much money he has and how he still grinding, like bro, u made it out, stay out, you don't gotta come back. Annoying ass album. Listen to it again u will get what im saying, i didnt hear it the first 10 times"
"Yeah, although I don't think it's the same group of people as the reddit elite, merely just a group of individuals that whip out their novelty account for a bit if karma. 

Alternatively, there are enough people on reddit that you're going to have a relevant username and try and take advantage of the opening for some comedic effect."
"Fair, but while they are huge for mechanical professionals I don't think they are as well known by homeowners. I thought of it because just yesterday I told my father about it and he'd never heard of them despite being a big DIY house guy."
"the victim complex? Bc if that's what you mean, I 100% agree.

Anyways, everyone knows poosh is a joke and just a safe way to make herself feel like she's doing something. Even she knows it's a joke.  she doesn't have the balls to leave the show, only complain about it. That's all she does, complain. 

She's too insecure to put 100% into anything. I actually respect kim a lot for being able to always put 1000% into any idea she has regardless of what anyone thinks. Kourtney is the opposite, terrified of failure so she half asses everything, including leaving this show, while still wanting a pitty party/money,perks. I dunno, she seems like the most selfish out of all of them."
