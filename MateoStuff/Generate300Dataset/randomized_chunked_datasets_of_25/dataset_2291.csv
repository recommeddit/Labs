22709,"Pink came on holiday in 2010 to island I was living/working on. She came into the pub and just hung out like a regular person. People asked for autographs, she chatted with people as if they were new friends, played pool for about three hours. Three of my friends jokingly asked is she'd like to come to their party they were having in their room that night (thinking she would decline). She said she would love to hang out with some of the staff that work on the island. She turned up and stayed for about an hour. 

I don't personally like her music, but when she comes in and acts like a regular person with no stupid demands and even goes to a random party, she is alright by me.",best celebrity

I know RPG's are usually used for fantasy world's and stuff like Witcher but I'd still say they fall under it as well since you role play as Spider-Man and Deacon in a zombie world.",Best RPG game on PS4
53928,"The antihistamine doesn't stop the draining, it stops the production of new mucus. Even after you stop new mucus, you need to get the existing gunk out. That's what the combo of anti-histamine + NSAID + decongestant does. It's commonly packaged together, for example, Claritin D is loratadine + pseudoephedrine (anti-histamine, decongestant). Advil allergy + congestion is chlorpheniramine + ibuprofen + phenylephrine (anti-histamine, NSAID, decongestant).  Some also include caffeine since that speeds up the effectiveness.",best medicine for a cold
