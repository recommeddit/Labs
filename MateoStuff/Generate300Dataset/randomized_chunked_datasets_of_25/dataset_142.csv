68359,"I truly enjoyed \*The Three-Body Problem\*.  I started \*The Dark Forest\* and honestly walked away from it just shy of halfway through.  Then a friend told me I had missed the best part, so I went back and finished it -- and was extremely glad that I did.

I got around to asking my public library to get the third book, \*Death's End,\* on cd (this is how I ""read"" the first two).  I'm very glad I did.  I'm about 1/4 way in (it's significantly longer than the first two), and it's *really* good.  While Liu's backstory storytelling can get a little dense at times, he keeps throwing out events and occurrences that I ""didn't see coming.""  There are a LOT of shoes left to drop in this story, from where I am in it now.  Highly recommended.",best science fiction novel

36857,"I've always felt like the Green Lantern hate is hugely overblown. I thought it was a great ride, not quite as good as Riddles revenge but I certainly enjoyed it, it's a very good layout with a lot of forceful moments and I love the straight drop on it, which is rare for a B&M looper. I guess Standups have never really been an issue for me.",best roller coaster at six flags
45270,"Are you wanting to start retro or new-gen consoles? If retro, I’d start with an Atari 2600 or NES. They’re not the first home consoles, but the more popular in the beginning of gaming at home. If new-gen is where you’re looking, PS4 would be a good start. I have an Xbox One, Switch, and PS4, but play the PS4 most. The Switch is a good console and there are a lot of great games for it already, but the library just isn’t there yet. As for Xbox One, there are only a few exclusive games for it that stand out, otherwise the games are on PS4 as well. Hope this helps.",best gaming system

All of the instructors were great and as soon as i got my A license Alan took the time to walk me around and introduce me to other jumpers and the load organizers so i could go straight into jumping with other licensed jumpers.

47222,"As a resident of KY I believe I can say parts of this state are absolutely worth visiting (it *is* Stephen Fry's favorite), however, not for  football (unless you're into collegiate sports), and not for bbq ribs (mutton bbq is particularly well prepared here, as is burgoo which is a KY stew often found at bbq shacks). I should take a moment to say we have amazing ribs, but that isn't what one comes to KY for. 

When you visit KY, come to Louisville.  It's the only U.S. City on Zagat's eight destinations that foodies must visit.  We have a top notch hotel/restaurant/contemporary art gallery. Bars stay open till 4am. 

Red River Gorge is one of the most scenic places on the planet, including Natural Bridge and Angels' Window natural arches. Get some pizza at Miguel's and chat up the rock climbers camped there. They'll be from all over the world.

Do the bourbon trail if you like whiskey. You'll get hammered. 

Come to KY in the spring. Any of the main cities will be just a few minutes drive from something beautiful. Daffodils and flowering trees practically cover the state, and there's nothing like a sunrise seen burning through the fog  of a spring morning , surrounded by redbud trees and stone fences in horse country.",best state to visit in the United States
