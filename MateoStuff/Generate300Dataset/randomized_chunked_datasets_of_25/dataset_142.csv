68359,best science fiction novel,"I truly enjoyed \*The Three-Body Problem\*.  I started \*The Dark Forest\* and honestly walked away from it just shy of halfway through.  Then a friend told me I had missed the best part, so I went back and finished it -- and was extremely glad that I did.

I got around to asking my public library to get the third book, \*Death's End,\* on cd (this is how I ""read"" the first two).  I'm very glad I did.  I'm about 1/4 way in (it's significantly longer than the first two), and it's *really* good.  While Liu's backstory storytelling can get a little dense at times, he keeps throwing out events and occurrences that I ""didn't see coming.""  There are a LOT of shoes left to drop in this story, from where I am in it now.  Highly recommended."
17054,best iOS game,I’m going to give it another go. Thanks.

63594,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,What exactly would you change about the repo installation process?
20518,best workout music,"This may sound weird but while running, I listen to a song from the 'Inception' Soundtrack called ""Time"" by Hans Zimmer. You get so pumped by the end of the song- I am usually sprinting down a street thinking I'm batman or somebody, saving the world. This is one of my guilty pleasures. Seriously one of you have to try it."
37106,best amusement park,"Might be its uniqueness. Enthusiasts will appreciate a REALLY quirky and unique coaster more when they've already ridden one of the other five El Locos, perhaps?"
43114,best detective show,"I am sad that no one has mentioned Rubicon (2010).

That show was really thoughtful and put together a really interesting mystery webbed in secret organisations and paranoia."
13097,best gifts for mom,A phone call; shes not much into the physical things and I don't see her for long periods of time due to being in the Army.
36857,best roller coaster at six flags,"I've always felt like the Green Lantern hate is hugely overblown. I thought it was a great ride, not quite as good as Riddles revenge but I certainly enjoyed it, it's a very good layout with a lot of forceful moments and I love the straight drop on it, which is rare for a B&M looper. I guess Standups have never really been an issue for me."
45270,best gaming system,"Are you wanting to start retro or new-gen consoles? If retro, I’d start with an Atari 2600 or NES. They’re not the first home consoles, but the more popular in the beginning of gaming at home. If new-gen is where you’re looking, PS4 would be a good start. I have an Xbox One, Switch, and PS4, but play the PS4 most. The Switch is a good console and there are a lot of great games for it already, but the library just isn’t there yet. As for Xbox One, there are only a few exclusive games for it that stand out, otherwise the games are on PS4 as well. Hope this helps."
52394,best hiphop album,that's literally what opinions are lmao. there's no right or wrong opinions.
10650,best suitcase lock,"I was on a train in Sri Lanka, there were a girl who got her backpack stolen that way."
69908,best major to study in college,"I figured it was almost the other way around, due to bosses and managers knowing jackshit about the work that goes into programming."
16921,best iOS game,"I just got into hyperlightD. Really cool game, I’ve connected my PS4 controller and it’s great"
12994,best gifts for mom,That is such a lovely idea! Good job :)
67116,best places to skydive in california,I cant comment on Perris as i have not jumped there but cant speak highly enough of my experience at Elsinore. All of the instructors were great and as soon as i got my A license Alan took the time to walk me around and introduce me to other jumpers and the load organizers so i could go straight into jumping with other licensed jumpers. They also have free coaching after aff which was really helpful.
43194,best detective show,Exactly my problem too! It’s such a dissectible show but none of my friends are interested in it.
47222,best state to visit in the United States,"As a resident of KY I believe I can say parts of this state are absolutely worth visiting (it *is* Stephen Fry's favorite), however, not for  football (unless you're into collegiate sports), and not for bbq ribs (mutton bbq is particularly well prepared here, as is burgoo which is a KY stew often found at bbq shacks). I should take a moment to say we have amazing ribs, but that isn't what one comes to KY for. 

When you visit KY, come to Louisville.  It's the only U.S. City on Zagat's eight destinations that foodies must visit.  We have a top notch hotel/restaurant/contemporary art gallery. Bars stay open till 4am. 

Red River Gorge is one of the most scenic places on the planet, including Natural Bridge and Angels' Window natural arches. Get some pizza at Miguel's and chat up the rock climbers camped there. They'll be from all over the world.

Do the bourbon trail if you like whiskey. You'll get hammered. 

Come to KY in the spring. Any of the main cities will be just a few minutes drive from something beautiful. Daffodils and flowering trees practically cover the state, and there's nothing like a sunrise seen burning through the fog  of a spring morning , surrounded by redbud trees and stone fences in horse country."
52349,best hiphop album,"How do the five best tracks on TPAB hold up against 

Juicy  
Everyday Struggle  
Things Done Changed  
Respect  
Warning  


Or 


It ain’t hard to tell  
Memory Lane  
NY State of Mind  
Life’s a Bitch  
The World is Yours  

Or 

Dead President II  
D’Evils  
Regrets  
Feelin It  
Can I Live  

Or

Kill You  
The Way I Am  
Stan  
I’m Back  
Who Knew  

And so on.

I like Kendrick but the internet dickriding and recency bias with him is exhausting.  There’s a list that says he has the two best albums in hip hop history? Idk if there’s a single song on TPAB that you could even put in the same playlist as the 20 songs I just listed."
17399,best iOS game,"Monument Valley series for sure, followed by INSIDE. Odyssey was okay."
72585,best keyboard switches,"Blues are my personal favourite -  but if you don't like them clicky then go with Browns imo.


Personal preference but I can't stand reds. 

I like Cherry MX the best but gaterons are a close second."
4841,best home improvement store,"I have a Lowes and a Home Depot within a mile of each other, so I tend to go to both...but to be honest, I always to go HD first.  I couldn't say why, I just do.  My dog seems to like HD more."
72161,best movies with a cool twist,Mother Night with Nick Nolte
66498,best soccer team in the world,"Switzerland plays better than the results show in my opinion. Defensive mistakes and not having a clinical forward are the drawbacks. Seferovic got his god mode on in that incredible match against Belgium, but he's no Lukaku or Lewandowski."
