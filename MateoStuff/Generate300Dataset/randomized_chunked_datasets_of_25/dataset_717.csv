12003,best gifts for dad,"Last year I went mountain biking in the morning, met the family for a great picnic lunch and swim in a lake, then finished the ride."
941,best desk lamp,"Was my old office. :) I have a better one somewhere if I find it I'll post, it shows the 2 in a very clean office when I first moved in there."
59187,best perfume,Elizabeth & James rose and Derek Lam 10 Crosby ellipses both get me a ton of complements!
519,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"We are using an OWL 360-view camera set up with Canvas conferences.  There are Wacom boards placed in some of the classrooms and I've tried using Microsoft Whiteboard with it and it's been the best option in my opinion; I have similar opinions as to what you've mentioned.  You can upload PDF's of slides, but it arranges them all on a grid so you have to zoom in to access any one slide that you want to annotate.  That's the frustrating part of MS Whiteboard."
68712,best science fiction novel,murder bot series should be on the list.
12546,best gifts for mom,Get her a vacuum but get her one that a robot that cleans the house for you.
53095,best hiphop album,"Nobody sound like this, sound like this..."
31322,best country to live in,"Siberia, Northern Mongolia and North Korea are cold places that are also miserable to live in. Even Switzerland has neo-Nazis. Bumped into few skinheads a couple of months back when I was there. Being well traveled, I find happiness to be a function of how well you fit in with the locals and vice versa. At the end of the day, I find people and their values more important for livability to me than climate and material infrastructure."
53750,best medicine for a cold,"There have been a handful of times that I've had a cold for a week or two that I couldn't shake, finally said ""fuck it, I'm going out anyway"" Proceeded to get blitzed then woke up fine the next day."
57481,best water brand,What's that miracle water that some famous person started. It was basically just water filtered over diamonds. They said the water absorbed the minerals of the diamonds. It sold for a ridiculous price too.
25881,best cricket teams of all time,"South Africa (90 M, 45 W, 25 L, 20 D)  
Australia (112 M, 57 W, 38 L, 17 D)"
51078,best rap album,"> But for NME to throw out that Alex Turner is a genius, **comparing him to John Lennon**, and all the other claims gets a little ridiculous after a while



that's been around for a while. I recall the not-really-that-impressive claim of ""Arctic Monkeys debut is better than the Beatles' debut!"" way back when they first started.

I know this is willful ignorance and all, but I've yet to even bother with Arctic Monkeys because of NME's love affair with them. NME strikes me as a not very reliable barometer for music taste, especially when they're very suspicious of non-UK acts and are quick to turn on acts they previously championed."
9708,best dorm hall at UCSB,Sounds awesome! I'd be so stoked to have an ocean view. Thanks for the info!
55842,best action and adventure movie,"Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Star Trek II - IV, Seven Samurai, Children of Men, Chinatown, Prometheus (I know, I know...it's just a bizarre obsession of mine), anything by M. Night Shyamalan (another bizarre obsession of mine).  Those are all rewarding upon many viewings."
11950,best gifts for dad,My god I read that like you gave your dad a BJ then...
7758,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I really don't think that there is as good of a device for the price from any other manufacturer... although it does not have as good of a display, nor does it have as much storage, this new configuration of the [**Acer Swift 3**](https://laptopsdeals.net/product/acer-swift-3-14-laptop-ryzen-7-4700u-16-gb-ram-512-gb-ssd-1080p-14-250-nit-ips/) would be a really good choice for the price."
68275,best science fiction novel,"*The Dispossessed* - Ursula Le Guin.  
*Frankenstein* - Mary Shelley.  
*I, Robot* - Isaac Asimov.  
*The Mote In God's Eye* - Niven and Pournelle."
17779,best Kardashian,"I mean personally Kourtney has never done anything unmoral in my opinion, i mean she is the only sister who isn't always being accused of stealing someone else's man. Kim, Khloe, Kylie and even Kendall have all been. She is also the one who remains the most lowkey when it comes to the family bullying someone, hence why she isn't on blac chyna's lawsuit. She also was the first one to tell all the girls to leave Rob alone and let him be happy with his engagement. Also the one who doesen't do culture appropiation. Sure Kourtney has her faults, but to say she's the least moral is a bit of a reach. ðŸ¥´"
42175,movies like Inception,"Requiem for a dream will leave you feeling very fucking depressed afterwards - you've been warned! Incredible movie, but not something I would ever watch again."
3404,best webcamera,Would anyone be able to recommend a PC for me then? I want to be able to use my capture card without it dropping frames on stream. I want to be able to stream sword and shield as well as other games from my switch/xbox one. The problem is with my 6 year old laptop it's just constantly dropping frames and is unwatchable. I would like to spend around 800-1000. Is this possible?
37403,best amusement park,It was either two or three years ago they had so many fog machines running on the midways you could not see from one end of the station to the other end of the station on Diamondback.
31589,best hotel to live in,"Liku Liku resort in Fiji. I've been to plenty of places like North Island Seychelles, but Liku Liku is hands down the best. Or at least it was 7 years ago ;)"
50841,best rap album,Interchangeable in my opinion. Just had Rock Bottom come on earlier today and it reminded me how much I really loved old Slim.
53627,best medicine for a cold,"Here's my Life Pro tip, buy all the ingredients of your common cold medicines as single medicines in bulk at Costco and save yourself a boatload of money.

This way, if your cold is only giving you a headache and a sappy cough, you can take some Tylenol, if appropriate for you, and some Mucinex. Don't bother taking any decongestants or antihistamines because your symptoms don't need it. Save money and put less stress on your systems by not taking unnecessary medicines."
55513,best action and adventure novel series,"If you want to begin an epic adventure with a cast of great characters, I recommend the [Wheel of Time](http://www.dragonmount.com/Books/index.php) series.  If fourteen books seems a bit too much, perhaps you'd rather another trilogy, like the Farseer trilogy by Robin Hobb, or Coldfire by C. S. Friedman. 

Shorter still, you could try a stand-alone book.  *Tigana* by Guy Gavriel Kay is amazing.  Or Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson which you can read for free on [his site](http://brandonsanderson.com/library/catalog/Warbreaker_Full-Books/).

Also, come over to /r/fantasy and we have a huge list of fantasy works in the sidebar."
