"Getting way into vetiver frags and got a travel spray of guerlain vetiver. Must say I'm impressed, mature and sophisticated with incredible staying power on me. 1961 classic still smelling great, at an outstanding value."
I just make my own.
"Certainly haven't tried everything, but:

Linear: Tealios, Gat Yellows

Tactile: Zealios 67

Clicky: Box Navy (or Box White if gaming)"
Genshin impact
I’m sure it isn’t good for anyone . Yuck
Literally any developed country
Acadia National Park has a ton of awesome hikes.  I liked the Bubble Rock trail even though it was short.  Blueberry Hill is a nice long hike.  If you are more adventurous then I am you can try Precipice Trail.  It's only 2 miles but it have a 930 ft elevation gain and iron rungs to climb up.  All in Maine if you do not know Acadia.
"Someone introduced me to this series last year, and I'm already about half way through. Enjoying it immensely."
There's a correct way of formatting lennies?
"You can just be playing the role of adventurer in a dungeon. I've played a ton of Dungeon and Dragons campaigns that focus almost exclusively on combat, no one would deny D&D being an RPG. The original Final Fantasy has a bare bone story but I've never heard someone claim that's not an RPG."
> Fuck you and your stupid fucking robot ideas. Your robot ideas are trash and I fucking hate you
"I thought I'm sorry was hilarious. I love the whole comedy bang bang crew. Scott aukerman, jason mantzoukas Rob huebel"
"yup, love his work so much"
Absolutely although one problem I've had is something feels comfortable in the store and then I go for a run on concrete and start noticing problems. I good example is the Nike Free RN. An extremely comfortable shoe and a good running shoe for some people.
Gone Girl
"You just have to fill out a form, you don't need to actually put a gun in the case."
"The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg is one that I really enjoyed. Basically explains how you can use the habit loop of cue, action, reward to change pretty much anything in your life. From there you can explore books like 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and others to pick the habits you want!"
Vodka and orange juice. Sometimes it's called a screwdriver. Is this a girly drink or a manly one? I never know
I'm no expert by any means but I'd say I prefer ultramale. It's sexier and more adult than eros. It has a more mature smell to it. Although I think that eros edp is better than edt and a really good fragrance. I regret not buying the edp version. It has a more fresh vibe than the edt
I use the Linux kernel version 5.4 and GNOME 3.28.
"Everyone here posting HD is why I go to Lowe’s. SO MANY LESS PEOPLE!

I’m able to walk around and actually pick out what I need instead of elbowing past people."
"I don't use what you use, but here goes for my experience.

I love Vim's modal and verb-object way better than anything else. I want that everywhere I can. That said…

* For big projects and frameworks a good IDE that supports vim plugins would feel a mistake to ignore. With a lot of work, snippets and macros one could sort of replicate the workflow, but that would be a whole part of your life dedicated to it for a long time. I use PHPStorm for Symfony, so where you have jinja2 I have twig and where you have Python I have PHP, and trust me it's bloody awesome when I create a controller, a template and whatnot and the right use statements are included on the go. Hard to beat really.
* When project-awareness is not warranted. Vim. But Spacemacs has qualities and defects of Vim with the best Vim emulation possible. Plus discoverability. Plus excellent defaults. Plus more or less standardized plugins ([layers](http://spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html)), sometimes making it WAY easier to get stuff up and running than spending the right amount of time and testing to find the right Vim plugin for you and the right way to install + configure it. With Spacemacs you put the name of the layer (eg ""yaml"") in the right place in the main dotfile (easy peasy), you reload and bam you're good to go with the community's preferred solution. I find that building an emacs config from the ground up is a tedious whole enterprise in and of itself, while building your favourite things on top of Spacemacs is fun.

If you feel like giving Spacemacs a go,  as a Vim fan with a terminal-multiplexer addiction (I love byobu to death), I'll suggest configuring your setup to use it as a daemon early on, so that once the daemon is started (ie at the init of the OS) you can start new instances way faster, and all communicating with one another. In terminal mode if you like ( ""-nw"").

All that said, whenever I can I still use Vim (Neovim actually), because the more lightweight the better, always."
There's that redditor that is somehow related to him and has good stories. Someone who isn't lazy wrestle up a link stat!
"And LBJ fan, I presume?"
