24100,best anime,"Cowboy Bebop is a really good example of a lot of things. Classic anime, great dubs, and great character development, especially considering its mainly episodic. 

K-On is the quintessential moe slice of life show. You may not like those things, but regardless, if you wanna see the sub-genre at its finest, look no further.

From The New World has great world building, and an interesting plot. It's a show where you have to pay a fair amount of attention or you'll be like ""what"" when you snap back into it. Fairly serious themes too.

Madoka Magica is a show that you should watch. I won't say why, but give it at least three episodes, and ideally ten. 

Usagi Drop is the number one show for making you feel better about everything. Life, yourself, the world, anything. This show never fails to put me in a better place.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has it all. It has action, it has good art and animation, it has exemplary characters, it has great music, it has the feels, it has the ""Fuck yeah!"" moments, it has the messages and morals, and it has a great story. Its dub is top-notch, it's well written and faithful to the source material. It appeals to a lot of audiences. It appeals to the crybaby in me that likes to feel, it appeals to the big brother in me, it appeals to the part of me that loves my parents. It covers so many things and reaches so many audiences. You can dislike this show, you can hate it, but you cannot tell me that it doesn't have a LOT going for it. It's not even my favourite show, but I definitely think of it as near perfect."
60681,Best comedy show on Netflix,Tom segura pretty much everything is my favorite.  Him and bill burr are what I’ve been watching the most lately.

54603,best artisan mousepad alternatives,My favorite mousepad os the Qck edge. My mousepad is getting old (coming on 3 years). I also tried the glorious 3xl but found it to be too slippery. Which artisan is most like the Qck?
931,best desk lamp,Wall mounted isn't a bad idea. Have you used this lamp before? I was leaning towards the LED type ones but I'm open to all suggestions.
42061,movies like Inception,"Though it's not as ""deep"" as those listed, check out 1996's The Arrival.

Fun sci-fi, very 90s feel, very underlooked and interesting movie."
56953,best water brand,Essentia?
65215,best phone service company,No 5G but I get very good LTE speed.  As high as 120 Mb at times but mostly in the 40-70 range.  On occasion I will see around 10 or so at worse but that's rarely.  Uploads are always good as well.
72440,best keyboard switches,"They're a capacitive rubber dome switch,  considered by many to be one of the best switches you can buy. They're also deadly expensive, which puts a lot of people off. Personally? I think they're better for typing than any of the MX switches! 

But again, completely opinion based.^^^topre"

22775,best celebrity,"I posted my last comment before I realized there was a ""Douchebag Celebrities"" thread, but I'll post the story here, too.

When I was 16 or 17, my friend and I got to visit the set of Mystic River. At the end of the visit we met Mr. Eastwood. We thought it would just be a quick handshake and maybe a photograph, but he invited us to have dinner with him. My friend and I were directing a play at the time, and Mr. Eastwood seemed very interested in hearing about it. I can't remember much else about the conversation, but I do remember that he was polite, soft-spoken, and funny.

And now for the part that you probably care about more. Before meeting Clint, we were taken around the area by an assistant to meet various cast members. We met all of the lead actors except for Lawrence Fishburne, and the assistant went to find him. She discovered that he was in a trailer nearby, so she brought us over to the trailer and knocked on the door.

""What's up?"" Fishburne asked from inside.

The assistant stuck her head in through the door. 

""Mr. Fishburne? There are a couple of high school students out here who would like to meet you.""

As I said in the other thread, he probably didn't know we were standing right there, but I still wasn't too impressed with his response:


""Tell'em to go fuck'emselves."""
