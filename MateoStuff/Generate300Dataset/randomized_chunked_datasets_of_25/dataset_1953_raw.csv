"Nah bro I just disagree. There has been a pretty big shift in the past several years evident in the changes and new marketing. And especially since they just specifically said the focus will be on 'guest experience.' 

Also all parks want to sell fast passes. CP is just annoying cause it's so flippin busy."

"I’ve honestly never thought of this, but it makes total sense."
i was wondering how the fuck she could possibly cheat at this till i realised the sneaky bitch took extra stomps.

"I assume, then, that you have given Ilium and Olympos a try? Awesome entrances, again, from Simmons."
"That's cool but it's not all about security updates. With each Android version comes a new API and eventually developers stop supporting the old versions or getting a degraded experience. So your apps stop working.

That still doesn't match Apple's support with full feature updates which doesn't match the standard on desktop operating systems. 10+ year old hardware can run the latest versions of Windows and Mac perfectly fine."
"Oh my God, I must have used that word in a wrong way. English is not my native language. What should I replace it with? I meant that you don't have a land currently, just imagine if you did."
Never heard of it. I guess Washington is pretending they haven't either

Zicam. That shit kicks ass. Plus there's different kinds for whatever symptoms you have.
"I am right there with you. 

I played with a group for a few years. It had moments of fun, but while I enjoyed spending time with those PEOPLE, I don’t think I really enjoyed the game much. It felt so samey EVERY time. And if it didn’t, those were rare. The setup SUCKED and the lore/campaign was really poorly done. 

I think it is a fine game with lots of content and some fun puzzles to solve, but not 27-30 3-hour-plays of said fun."
"Unfortunately they literally marketed the movie as having ""THE BIGGEST TWIST IN YEARS"" and it wasn't hard to see coming from literally the first scene if you were expecting it."

"I absolutely loved that film. Best thing I've seen in years.

Everything is set up beautifully."

I’ve been testing out a sample of this & am loving it so far!
Any cases for the 13 pro max where it has the button opened like in my apples silicone 11 pro max case?
I’m surprised the classic PUA answer of “no cologne” hasn’t shown up here.
"If you’re into first person games with RPG elements, try Dying Light with the Following. A lot of game, a lot of player customization, and probably the best zombie game that I have played (I was too sick of Uncharted to get into the Last of Us). The only caution is a weak story."
