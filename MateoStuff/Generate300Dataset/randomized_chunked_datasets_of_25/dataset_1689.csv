*Edit.  Sorry, sadly a lot of people these days don't understand or have a negative perception of forestry so I was hesitant to ramble about it.

My experience is a bit different than the usual.  I work for a very small company, so I end up doing a little bit of everything whereas most foresters work for a government entity (Forest Service, BLM, State Forestry) or a timber company and specialize in one or two areas.

Here are some common duties.

* Cruising, if necessary.  This is estimating the volume of timber in the forest using data collection and statistics.

* Unit Layout. Finding and marking property lines, which is often not easy in the middle of nowhere.  If no monuments exist, they need to be surveyed in.  Evaluating access.  If necessary, designing roads and/or obtaining permission to use a neighbor's property.  Protecting sensitive areas from logging operations, such as streams, wet areas, unstable areas, and certain wildlife species.

* Permitting.  This is highly dependent on the state you're working in and its forest policies.

* Logging Bidding.  Finding loggers, showing them the project.  Evaluating bids in regard to cost, timeliness, experience, equipment, availability, etc.

* Timber Marketing.  Timber mills are all different and specialize in processing different species and different sizes of timber.  Working with mills to find maximum value in terms of price they are willing to pay and the cost it takes to transport those logs


* Contract Management.  Checking on the project to make sure all of the above is getting executed properly and timely.

* Reforestation.  Finding seedlings, supervising the planting process, deciding on any herbicides that need to be applied to slow growth of competing species.

* This is the industry side of forestry.  There are many other jobs, like working for the state ensuring people are following rules, fighting forest fires, being a park ranger, studying ecology/hydrology/etc.

[OSU](http://www.forestry.oregonstate.edu/academic-programs/undergraduates/undergraduate-majors) has a pretty good breakdown of different forestry focuses and careers.  There are many jobs that don't require a degree, though."

10249,best pencil for drawing,"Most mechanical pencils have relatively thin lead.  Sketching on canvas with a thin lead seems like it would be an exercise in frustration with the thin lead catching and breaking regularly on the rough surface.

Look for a lead holder rather than a traditional mechanical pencil.  Lead holders can take 2mm leads which would stand up to much more abuse than even the thicker mechanical pencil leads.  2mm leads also allow you to more easily vary line width because they behave more like a regular pencil lead and allow for the creation of relatively large flat spots in the lead when that is needed.

Rotring does lead holders and they have a good reputation for robust, metal bodies.  That's where I would look if I wanted to buy a metal lead holder.  On the other hand the weight of those brass bodies might be fatiguing for someone who draws a lot.  That might be worth checking with your wife prior to purchase."

67244,axios alternatives reddit,"All 400 level responses are explicitly errors.

 A 404 is never a valid non error response. It indicates you requested a resource that doesn’t exist. And thus is a user level error."

63204,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"IMO Sileo. I’ve used Cydia since its creation. It’s a wonderful package manager and honestly still does its jobs. But obviously it’s wide open for improvement. It’s slow compared to others and lacks a few other things.

Zebra is also a good one, game change actually. It’s quick and intuitive but crashes randomly for me and has trouble refreshing sources or installing packages sometimes it just freezes or sitting there.

Sileo is best imo. Although it lacks dark mode everything is top of the line. It’s being rewritten also in swift which means it’ll just get faster. It has batch adding of tweaks and a much more modern design. Also intuitive and easy to use"
44079,best items under $100,"I got cited for a hit and run many years ago that I didn't commit, but since there was (old) damage to my car the cops decided to take the accusor's side. So I'm going to have to say this is a great idea for everyone.

FTR the judge threw out the case, but I still wasted time in court and money on lawyers."

I'd configure it with a 8-core Ryzen 7 4700U processor, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6"" IPS 400 nit display. Otherwise, you could wait for Ryzen 5000."

54561,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I'm in the US and it's been smooth every time for me. They ship through DHL which does pretty good on timing and tracking information IMO. I usually get it within a few weeks, which is fine with me considering the pandemic. Only drawback is it adds an extra $20+ for shipping. I almost always order 2 pads since I know shipping will be a lot so if I want to try a few I go for it!"

Big fan of Persol, especially if you can find them second hand since the price point up front is a little overpriced."
64282,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"Your words, not mine: ***""I actually buy CDs and rip""***

My perspective was simply that Audible allows creating CDs from their Audiobbooks.  What I didn't say was CDs are an anachronism today. I would posit that 85-90% of audiobook listeners prefer digital devices. As to requiring Windows, well perhaps - but even if true, that's 85% of all the computers in the world. Additionally, I'm not aware of PCs sold after 2005 that don't include CD burners. Most today will also bake standard DVDs and I speculate some can cook up Blu-Ray discs.

As *sblinn* observed ""a pile of CDs"". Only true if your opt for conventional audio compact platters.  A minor bit of effort will generate MP3 CDs for those who desire to carry discs but virtually no effort if you prefer to place the MP3s on an iPod or other non Apple digital player."
