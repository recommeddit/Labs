32439,best vacation resort,"Thanks! I am trying to keep it around $5000 usd. I live in Seattle so I have easy access to an international airport. I literally want to lay on a beach with a drink in my hand one day, snorkel/jet ski/charter cruise etc. another day, have a pool with a swim up bar, decent rooms (looking like we will need 2 rooms which kinda sucks but I’m not finding much in budget that can sleep 6) and maybe some sort of night life club, casino, shows etc. if Vegas was on the beach, I’d be staying at Caesar’s, Bellagio, Wynn, or Palazzo if that helps with my taste preferences lol. My dates are in middle of October which I’m nervous about booking anything in the Caribbean during that time frame so I’m looking at west coast Mexico or Hawaii too. One cousin will be coming in from Japan, but the rest of my party will come from Texas so Hawaii or Mexico are easy locations for all of us to meet up."
47984,best color to paint with,I've got been thinking of painting one wall orange. Never the whole room though.
6167,best Netflix documentary,At least you know the villian is going to rot in a jail cell alone for the rest of his life. But it did good because it's exposing and giving athletes in other countries the courage to speak up. Hit the uk men and women and Australia and new Zealand.. More emotional and verbal than physically
63493,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Great list!
16502,best sunglasses for fashion,"I think MFA had a great feature on sunglasses but I can't look it up easily from mobile. With that said:

1) Extreme shapes will go out of style fast. Best thing to do is walk into nordstroms/any mall and just try on pairs that fit your face well. 

2) Ray Bans - honestly i bought mine for $80 from amazon and they were amazing. I've had them over 5+ years with DAILY wear (San Diego weather, yay!). The one thing I have to say is splurge for the polarized lens - so worth it. I've had to change my out because my vision dipped so badly I had to start getting prescription lenses. Maui Jims are great from what i hear I just never found a frame that fit as well as the RBs do. Another place to consider is Warby Parker. They mostly do regular glasses but I've seen sunglasses in their UTC store. Now for something extremely nice (>$1000) my one rec is Leisure Society. They are sooooo frigging sweet but alas a bit outside of most people's price range. 

3) Ive never found glasses on first try. Look for a place wtih a good return policy or try on in store first. 

4) As far as nice glasses on sale - you betcha! May not be the newest styles but there are plenty of online ""high fashion"" websites (gilt, amazon's MyHabit, etc..) I've snatched my friend a nice pair of Celine's for 1/2 price before. I would recommend know which websites accept returns and never deal with fake glasses (As well as being able to tell fakes apart from real ones). 
With that being said - most ""fashion"" glasses are made by Luxottica (think of them as SWATCH group of glasses) if you want better quality for a better price look for a brand that isn't owned by them."

29730,best money managing app,"The thing I like about online is: You can usually enter transactions manually still. There seems to be a day or two delay before you can import them, but if you manually enter them and it then imports the transaction, it doesn't duplicate it. It only ""links"" them together.

But at the same time, if you miss a transaction it will automatically import it for you in a few days."

35736,best alcoholic drink,"I've never even heard of Gosling's alcohol, didn't know they made it.  That being said, their Ginger Beer is leaps and bounds better than any other brand I've tried and I've tried at least 8 or 9 different brands."

49009,best gaming monitor,I have the Dell 2719DGF (1440p 144hz) which I got for around 230 after rebates and discounts and I think it’s the best choice I’ve made so far.
45240,best gaming system,"I have a PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, Quest 2 and a Switch. If I had to choose just one of them, I would probably say PS5. My reasoning is that the PS5 controller is absolutely fantastic (my favourite of any console by quite a margin), and there are many great exclusive games (including PS4 games that are now available at higher resolution/better framerates for free on PS5 with a PS+ subscription). I think it’s all about individual taste though, to be honest."
20210,best workout music,"[Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/moivx.jm/playlist/5q26YYXqIf9C0itXpWjQBP)

59870,best perfume,"Gucci - Rush 2

Byredo - Gypsy Water

Both incredible. The Gucci one not quite as long-lasting as I'd want it to be but I've been wearing it for 10+ years and still love it to bits as my every day perfume."
15186,best tree for the garden,It would get pretty damn cold up there where OP is. Your correct. Beautiful trees through.
17583,best iOS game,[Two Spies](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/two-spies/id1466304408) is fantastic and the only IAP is cosmetic to help support the development. Turn based spy vs spy strategy game.. each game takes around 10-15 minutes typically.
15069,best romantic novel,Don’t have much to say except I agree completely with everything you’ve said! It’s so sad the way a women’s view is treated in society.
