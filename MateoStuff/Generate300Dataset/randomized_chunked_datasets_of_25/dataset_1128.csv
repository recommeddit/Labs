[Tonegawa's paper on DNA recombination in immunology](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v302/n5909/abs/302575a0.html) (Sorry I don't have the PDF available)

Barbara McClintock's paper on transposons (McClintock, B., 1950. The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 36: 344-355.) This paper is socially interesting as much as scientifically. The amount of evidence she felt she needed to have in order to publish a paper (presumably because she was a woman) is astounding. 

The last suggestion is about [Educational Research: The Hardest Science of All?](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=education%20research%20hardest%20science%20of%20all&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.64.2102%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&ei=up66To26KYi22gXhv4S7Bw&usg=AFQjCNFvT-B41SJbTSdOznKU4Dcfvf1BQQ&cad=rja) which allows you to discuss the differences in science in different fields. In education we can't control all the factors so we have to approach some things differently. Doesn't mean we're less scientific, we just have to make adjustments to our expectations and results.",best research paper archive
