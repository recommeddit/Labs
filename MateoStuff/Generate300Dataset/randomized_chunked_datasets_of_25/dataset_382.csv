21502,"It's a good comic, and true too, there was some bitterness between Christopher Robin and AA Milne.  When Christopher was in school, he was teased mercilessly by the other kids, they kept asking him if he was saying his prayers.  

There is a bio of CR Milne around somewhere, I read it several years ago.  

Edit - I really dislike the Disney Pooh, I have ever since someone gave one of those books to my son as a gift, it was a story where Rabbit doesn't like Tigger and he talks the others into abandoning him in the woods.  That would have never have happened in the AA Milne books.  Just thought it was a shitty version of Pooh.",best winnie the pooh comic

5798,"This is awful advice. PHP is in high demand. Some seasoned programmers might dislike it but it's much easier to find a PHP job instead of any other trending language/framework. I am not saying to focus on PHP but it's pretty important to know, most websites have PHP for their server side language and that's a fact. Not to mention that there are a lot of businesses that will pay top dollar for custom Wordpress/Drupal site. But that's my experience, I am not in Silicon Valley, most jobs around my area are for PHP developers.",best programming language for web development
