49450,best gaming monitor,"I have a Dell S2716DG which has been fantastic. It’s a TN panel, but has great colors. The early revisions had problems with color banding, but they fixed that later.

I’d recommend it happily."

32222,best hotel to live in,"I've worked with a few celebrities and athletes in the past, in a different capacity than hospitality. The ones I worked with *always* used fake names, plus their room was actually reserved and paid for by their assistants so their name never showed on paperwork. However, since they were listed as staying in the room, their name was added to the card, and that's where the fake name comes in.

One guy, the late author Tom Clancy, always used the name of his lead character, Jack Ryan when getting a room."

Worked out great, so my theme is.. well.. brown. Light brown and wood."
