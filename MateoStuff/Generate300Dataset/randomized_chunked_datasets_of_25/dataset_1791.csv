23598,best car racing video game,"NOTE:  
The Console and PC versions were made by two completely different dev teams.  

The console version offers an arcade-like and heavily watered down experience.   
The PC version was designed as a simulator where you progress through the era of Porsche automobiles, with real crash physics, a detailed progression system, money to earn and upgrade your cars, and it also contains a lot of historic information about each and every Porsche in the game in the form of videos.    

If you only ever played the console version or you were a fan of the ""simmy"" aspects from the very first Need for Speed(from Road&Track magazine), you owe it to yourself to find and play NFS: Porsche unleashed.  

It runs well on modern systems and can be modded to support 21:9 aspect ratios."

5912,best programming language for web development,"That's a fair point. I guess I was more referring to *thin* from the developer/consumer perspective in that the browser has become so ubiquitous you can essentially take it for granted and abstract away that complexity when you're developing web apps. That being said, you're absolutely right that the browser itself as a piece of software in itself is not simple or thin."

55900,best action and adventure movie,I had some friends whom were adamant about not seeing it so I never saw it in theaters. I saw it a few months ago finally and I freaking loved it. Everything from the videogamish setting to the characters interactions with each other was just enjoyable all around. I can't wait to see the sequel when that eventually come out.
33729,best electric car,"I'm gonna be honest, I live in a cold ass place and electric cars are proven not to last long here because the battery tech is not at its peak yet. I'm not a fan and I really perform gas cars still. However I really like the concept of hydrogen vehicles and I test drove a Toyota Mirai and I can honestly see myself owning one at some point once they're released up here. It didn't have the feel of an electric car it felt like an every day gas car and i was very impressed. I hope the technology takes off"

5675,best programming language for web development,"Yes, that's the feeling I get. Speaking of programming in Switzerland, considering it's one of the best economies in the world, how much do web developers make there? Are there a lot of positions available for qualified people? My friend had a Swiss girlfriend and said he sometimes had to pay $20+ for a hamburger there, so maybe a lot of USD wouldn't go a long way. :)"
