"Exactly. Trusting Microsoft to guard your data is like trusting a wolf to guard the henhouse. If you like Chrome but want to use something similar that protects your privacy, use Brave."
"I went to my CC for 4 years because I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do right away, and it was a life saver. Community colleges are amazing."
You are correct. Lodi parachute center is $150 for tandem. If you want photo and video it is $50 more. Just jumped my first and second time last week. My dad jumps there almost daily. Great place and great people.

No results. 

Aww come on high schoolers 


Edit: Holy shit guys, this really blew up and turned into my highest rated comment! I've read through a lot of the threads already and it seems that a lot of people have been answering questions under this, I posted and then just went back to work and couldn't get on reddit due to lack of service. 

I encourage anyone who is interested in going into agriculture to read through some of the responses in this thread. If anyone would like to either pm me or comment again on here and ask a specific question, I've worked in chemical, grain, and livestock and done peri much everything in between. 

Edit 2: Also, for anyone with more than a year left in high school, I encourage you greatly to look into FFA. Its, in my opinion, one of the most important student organizations in America, and is great at building skills used in all industries."
I think it's time to create one.

The autoharp. Just press the buttons and strum. It creates the chords for you.
"I got a degree in Film Studies, graduated 7 years ago. Let that sink in. However I have never been wanting for relevant and gainful employment, I worked an IT job through college which has been my ticket to a lot of interesting workplaces, both inside and outside the film industry.

If I went back, I'd likely slow down on finishing the degree and take more math, work hard on learning software development, and finish with a CS degree."
Wow cool were actually in the top 10. Number 9!

The Infamous. Not one second of bad work on that classic.
"Hugo Boss... Mmmmm

But if you're tryin to stay cheap, Axe Chocolate and Touch."
I recently purchased the Asus model and would recommend it if gaming is your main concern.
You could use a promise chain so that you don‚Äôt have to nest those `await`s
Ahh I'm on 1440p. That's the difference.

"1. I liked Khaled khaled wasn‚Äôt that bad but best album so far is slime language 2 

2. Best beat is easily miss the rage by trippie redd and playboi carti so far 

3. It‚Äôs in contention with  paid the fine by thug baby and gunna and don toliver with gunna and uzi on his and hers and also khaled with nas and jay z   Out of those three I think paid the fine was kinda ruined by trench as with don toliver ans gunna and uzi they did they thing but I feel like toliver outshine all of em on the track but this is the most fun song on the list to me but I feel like nas and jay z had the best feature because it was unexpected and it is legendary that these once rivals became allies to make a classy cool track 

4. Best verse was lil Wayne In seeing green has many witty verses you pick lol and I don‚Äôt know why but when trippie said like gta we shoot at helicopters üöÅ I feel like that verse is lit especially when you got that miss the rage beat playing in the background 

5. Best hook in hip hop probably his and hers by don toliver 

But also I like the song by the late deceased rapper mo3 called outside that had a great hook you also got morray with trenches. You also got crocodile teeth by skiibeing what you need by don toliver lol theirs a decent amount but his and hers tops the list in my opinion just slighty



1. Best album cover is Pooh shiesty 
Shiesty season spring deluxe it look cool lol  maybe beam me up Scotty in second place 

2. Worst album any album I didn‚Äôt save in my plays list lol but I think my most disappointed album was khaled khaled he should of went harder with the connections he has and features he had on that album should of been a couple more bangers
And don‚Äôt get me started on lil tjays destined 2 win‚Ä¶ that album was super disappointing especially comparing it to his first album 
4. I actually enjoyed khaled khaled somewhat lol most dragged it 

5. I think morrays album was decent underrated guy and artist to look forward to someone similar to rod wave"
But the longer you go at it the better the ending is!
I grew up in central Florida. I remember anything above 80 being brutal but not 70+ :s
"Thank you!

To be honest, there's a personal drive too. All my utilities strive to be thin and performant. I am a heavy cmdline user myself (thanks to my profession) and I prefer to spend the amount of time I am at the system as productively as possible."
"Seriously.  I love that book, and I love [The Functional Art](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739) by Alberto Cairo.  It's a fantastic book that dives into the cognitive psychology behind how people process different types of visualizations."

"The general opinion of the original 1 Million in the fragrance community is it's played out. I recently got a 50ml bottle of it's latest flanker, Lucky, for about $50. I'd recommend checking out others in the line or stick with what you like."
