12312,best gifts for mom,/r/Homebrewing probably has some good advice. I would recommend against getting a Mr. Beer kit because it makes about 10 bottles for roughly the same amount of work to make 50 bottles with a regular kit.

23069,best celebrity,"Brian May from Queen was wonderful to meet.  Kind, chatty, enthusiastic about what the band was up to, even teased me about my accent in a gentle way.  Roger Taylor was with him, and while I didn't chat with him as much, he was equally kind and friendly.  

Also ran into Chris Evans at Walt Disney World, and while I didn't approach him (he was clearly trying to fly under the radar), he was very polite to the few people who did."

Ok, I like Sex Panther. 60% of time... It works every time.

&#x200B;

You're absolutely right it doesn't project WELL for a long time, only for the first hour. It's sad because it's very solid minus the longevity issue!"
32311,best hotel to live in,"I worked in a Major Vegas Hotel as the Senior Hotel Manager. I’ve seen it all. A few things you wouldn’t know:

-	Every hotel has bed bugs at some point. It’s not the hotels fault, we noticed international travelers tend to bring them. Probably because they’re staying at multiple hotels per trip. You can even get them from the airplane. To check for bedbugs just inspect each layer of the sheets, under the pillows and mattress. They look like tiny roaches. If you see blood spots on the sheets the next morning that’s usually a sign you have been bitten, but the bites can sometimes take a few days to show or get noticed. 
-	Checking in late at night sometimes means free upgrades or discounted upgrade rates. We would try to sell every last suite at night for almost 80% off. We just wanted something, so they don’t go unoccupied. Sometime if we were over sold on rooms, the late late arrivals (midnight) would get a free suite upgrade because we had no choice. Of course this could also backfire if the hotel is sold out. You may get downgraded for being a late late arrival. 
-	When you complain, the nicest, more understanding guest gets the better compensation, the rude guest gets bare minimum. Always treat the staff with respect and be friendly, you’d be surprised the number of people who are rude. Even for the smallest of issues."

46919,best hand santizer brand,"The main one in the front on my mind right now is that it makes the negative effects of smoking worse by making it easier for all those chemicals to get into your blood system. 

Even if you don't smoke, the alcohol isn't selecting what its killing. It will kill pretty much every cell it comes in contact with, including yours. In the short term, its not a lot of damage, and the tissue in the mouth regenerate really fast, but it can make healing from something else slower.


According to this the following study, long term use of mouthwashes containing alcohol increases the risk of getting oral cancer. ""the use of an alcoholic mouthwash twice daily increased the chance of acquiring cancer by over nine times (OR 9.15) for current smokers, over five times for those who also drank alcohol (OR 5.12) and almost five times for those who never drank alcohol (OR 4.96).27""
