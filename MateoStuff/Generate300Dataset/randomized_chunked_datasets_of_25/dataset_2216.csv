37739,best Marvel movie,"I can never pick between Infinity War and Endgame for best. Infinity War is a better film, but man: Endgame has so many amazing moments, I don't think I've ever enjoyed watching a movie in the cinema more. 

Worst is definitely Dark World. I've tried rewatching that movie like 5 times, each time lowering my expectations on entry and trying to give it a fresh shot. I never make it through. That shit sucks ass."
9518,best toothpaste,"I think brush is a different story than paste. My dentist says most are good, but make sure to go with soft bristles and you probably need a new one more often than you think."
25014,best spiderman actor,"That's a pretty big part of his character though, Peter is one of the Marvel geniuses. Right next to Reed Richards and Tony Stark. Tobeyman had the personality down to a tee, but you never really got a sense of genius from him (Andrewman too on that account). That's something I appreciate from the new guy"
5083,best home improvement store,"I have a friend who was trying to get a dishwasher installed.  He bought it and picked it up, Home Depot set up the installation for the next weekend.  Two days later the Home Depot delivery truck stopped by and left another dishwasher on his patio while he was out.  The weekend came, the installer showed up....with another dishwasher in his truck.  He ended up taking two back, got so tired of waiting for someone to understand what was going on that he just left them and went home."
34869,best NFL player,"Funny, 2020 was the year myself and u/MattyT7 began ranking ðŸ¤”"
25463,best cricket teams of all time,"Bradman is a weird one. 

He played at a time when cricket was not as serious as it has been for the past few decades. Moreover,  cricket was mostly played in either Eng or Aus so players didn't have to adapt much. They also faced the same bowlers season after season. Speaking of bowlers, were there any bowlers then who would be considered world class today?

He was a great batsman no doubt. The best of his times. How he would have done against the great WI bowling attack or the Australian attack of early 2000's or against the spin wizards of the subcontinent? It's difficult to say. It is also unfair to the modern batsmen because the challenges they face today are different."
20562,best workout music,The Glitch Mob remix is great too!
28294,best breakfast foods,CT crunch represent!
37438,best amusement park,Completely disagree. They have a few incredible coasterâ€˜s but for the most part they just threw a bunch of kiddy coasters up with minimal theming just so they could get their numbers up. Despite the numbers they still have nothing on Cedar Point or Six Flags Magic Mountain when it comes to pure thrill rides.
38464,best newspapers to read,"Me, but I'm 52 yrs old and need the physical copy to justify my news."
16520,best sunglasses for fashion,"I am obsessed with sunglasses and spend way more than I should. I live in AZ so I suppose I can justify it that way. Oliver Peoples makes good shades if you want more of a casual/fashionable. I don't understand the comments on the Ray Bans as I had my pair a couple of years without issues. Polarized is the way to go! If you are concerned about quality, get them from a retailer that has a good return policy (ie Nordstrom or Costco). Yes, Costco has a decent selection of shades including Ray Bans and Maui Jims. My fav brand is Salt Optics. On pricier end but awesome quality. Also, I bought my husband a pair of Ray Bans recently on jet.com using a 15% discount code"
8554,best toothpaste,Just don't leave the cap off of it.
34683,best NFL player,Who was the previous #1?
41493,best instrument to play,"Guitar. So many different things you can do with it because of amps and pedals, plus acoustic guitars. Piano is better if you want to learn theory but guitar is just more versatile and more fun imo."
23415,best car racing video game,"> Not sure why this isnt' on gamepass

Because Forza games, up to this point (I wonder if FH4 will be different since it actually launched on Game Pass), get delisted 4 years after release. So if you don't already own it, only way to play it now is find a disc copy somewhere."
57651,best cologne,From a womanâ€™s perspective....YSL Lâ€™Homme ALL THE WAY!
52104,best iphone case,"I ended up ordering this case, but it feels very slippery in my hand."
68473,best science fiction novel,"Books do lack a certain depth, but they're enjoyable, well paced, well structured, and as you said excellent world building.  I really enjoyed MLM chapters.  And it is impossible to have a more deus ex machina ending then the nights dawn trilogy, had me chuckling for days.  His short story w/ the undergound bitek fights is great.  Good lighthearted reading."
13845,best research paper archive,[The importance of stupidity in scientific research](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771.full.pdf). Pretty self explanatory and a nice handout for a Biology class.
12241,best gifts for dad,"Very few fathers really want a tie. If he normally wears them, ties are a part of his style. Let him pick his own."
29650,best game console,+Sunset Overdrive ^^:(
24257,best anime,"Thank you for making this list, this is the second list that I have seen that I like. I have seen 86 from the top 100 and a couple of the ones missing it's because I read the manga instead, already added some to the PTW"
54400,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hien mid mostly sits in the closet, and i use a G-SR as my main.

It's all preference. The Hien is top tier quality."
59331,best perfume,"Check adore beauty online. They stock Juliet has a gun and might ship to NZ. If they don't, I'm in Australia and willing to ship on to you!"
43510,best items under $100,"This is how I feel when I put foundation all over my face to get rid of the redness, then apply blush on top of that to put redness where I want it."
