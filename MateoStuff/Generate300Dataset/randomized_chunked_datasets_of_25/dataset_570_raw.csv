"Very nice little essay. I think there is another flaw in this article. It doesn't take into account long-term job-advancement prospects. I notice that a lot of these majors have jobs with high starting salaries but do not have good long-term prospects (e.g. Pharmacist).

I am also surprised that Finance, Accounting, and Computer Science didn't make the list (although both Accounting and Finance usually require at least one more year of follow-up to get a Masters to get a CPA or CFA). Overall, I just think this is a very poorly conceived/researched/written article.

Your article was much better."
"thanks for the suggestions, i’ll be sure to do some of those!"
"And it’s followed up by the Paladin’s Legacy series. Not with much Paks, but it has plenty of the supporting cast."

Do you know how hard it is to drag Walton and Lanier up and down a court for 48 minutes?"
"Home depot is more of a contractors store and Lowe's is more for your average home owner. They have more stylish options where home depot typically carries more construction grade items. When it comes to appliances I can't say much. I havent ever bought either from one of those two stores. 

This may be just in my area."

"The article is factually incorrect.  Hand sanitizers do not work by removing a layer of oil (that's an unintended side-effect, actually); rather they directly kill bacteria and destroy viruses.  They are, further, considered orders of magnitude more efficient against most virus strains than soap.  Moreover, you need to distinguish between proper and improper application of sanitizers.  And finally, ""kills 99.99% of all germs"" is not a serious sanitizer anyway, so comparing soap with this kind of sanitizer is a straw man.  

That being said, of course it is more efficient to use soap if you have lots of sticky stuff on your hand (e.g. in food preparation), and everybody knows that.  For most other purposes, proper use of an appropriate hand sanitizers will be superior for almost all types of germs (some gram-positive are not affected)."

"Excuse me what? That just sounds insane to me. Aside from holiday periods, national flights in NZ run from $35 (smaller cities) to $70 ( large cities) as the standard non-sale price. That’s about $27 - $54 USD."
"The plan you were looking at was the $25 talk and text plan available from AT&T prepaid. I added a separate plan for the $25 8GB promo, which is now on the chart."
