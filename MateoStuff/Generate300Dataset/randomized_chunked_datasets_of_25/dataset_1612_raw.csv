Can you cite any sources other than your fingers?"
Have you tried getting drunk on soap & water?
"It’s all about location. I love that I can bundle with FiOS and I guess you’ll have coverage everywhere, even if it’s 1 bar.

My old address in NJ, AT&T was better than Verizon and it’s opposite for others, it’s all about your hood.

One thing about Verizon is that it’s king in NYC, their hometown, the only carrier to work in tunnels. So yea if you are in a city, your money may be with Verizon"
And everything else by Herzog.
"I’m on Chimera and personally love Sileo. It’s all personal preference tho. I’ve tried Zebra and like that too, as far as the drama there is mainly Drama around CoolStar, Who is the lead dev of Chimera and Sileo."
God it would be nice to pee in peace once in a while.

"If you read the list further down you'd see that was made clear, and that those versions of the games were labelled as the preferable versions.  However I chose to keep them in that list because of the anniversary edition.  I'll take away Halo 2, and rename Halo 1 to anniversary.  I hope this is sufficient."
"Corporate intern events where the kids would get plied with alcohol. Infuriating. We had one company annually bring 80 interns as part of a site visit tour, and it was a nightmare.

I was sure someone would die every year. One year there were three hospitalizations though, and one of the boys sent the hospital bill to the hotel. To be clear, the entire F&B team knew about the event and were very vigilant about refusing service. We were not involved or liable in his medical issue. The audacity.

Particularly because he and all of his intern colleagues trashed everything. We had to prepare the lobby by removing sculptures and porcelain plant pots. One year we started always removing a kind of sharp-cornered bookcase because too many drunk interns had hurt themselves on it. There were bodily fluids everywhere and linens destroyed beyond continued use. Plumbing broke daily. There was always smoking damage in some rooms. 

But all the adults were useless, of course. And all adults were culpable in providing alcohol to the underage people. The company accepted the bill for the damage every year, and always came back. And we would add literally everything we could. We would tack weeks worth of room nights onto their bill because we had to keep dozens of rooms out of service while damage was repaired. The company paid for everything we comped for complaining guests too. They also paid for anything we had to replace, and they were so used to the damage fees we would just throw things in there sometimes. Like a treadmill finally broke during their residence. But did one of their guests break it? Don't know, didn't care, they bought us a new treadmill.

We were one of three hotels on this annual tour."
"Late to the party, but here in Sweden we have a small ice cream maker called Lejonet & Björnen. 

Their ice cream are bit pricier, but tastes like heaven. Their ""thing"" is to have whats says on the package in the ice cream.

For example, if it says ""Organic Banana"", the ice cream has real, organic banana in it. And the ice cream isn't yellow, it's brown. 


My favorite is Honey and saffron. It's bloody amazing!"
I'd add Saks Fifth Ave as another place. Picked up traditional rayban clubmasters for $85 after tax. They also had wayfarers too.
"Great selection, specialty Libre, pffff that’s an elegant and sexy scent 10/10"
Based on the stories I've heard after he left Community.. This isn't surprising.
Thanks for the link. Do you know how much would it cost me of out the door for these apartments?
Vanilla bean is the shit!
Agreed. That article and Goodman's [followup on the Bayes Factor](http://www.annals.org/content/130/12/1005.full.pdf+html) are what got me interested in investigating how Bayesian analysis can be used in traditional psychology studies.
"YOU THINK A TRACER CAN STOP ME?! AHAHAHAHA-  
  
I'm imagining a naked dude running down the street holding a phone maniacally laughing as the feds are chasing him."
Yeah I was confused for a bit when you were talking about the French and Indian war cus I couldn't think of a time when the U.S. and France went to war but then I realized you were talking about the 7 Years War lol
