Pele wasn't even the best Brazilian of his time, never mind the best ever. Most popular, probably, best, not even close. Ask any Brazilian in their 60s or older, Garrincha was a  better footballer. Also, (Fat) Ronaldo, Romario, and Neymar were/are all better Brazilian strikers. They just weren't around when Brazil won every game by a bag of goals with one main striker like Pele was.

Wrong sub to rant about this, but one sure way to separate actual soccer fans from casuals is to ask this question and see what they say. If they say Pele, I immediately know they don't watch much soccer.

Maradona, Cruyff, van Basten, Best, Muller, Eusebio... the list of better attacking footballers goes on. And I'm ignoring defensive players.

But to end with an answer, rather than just needless whining, Messi and Ronaldo are the #1 and #2 of all time. Modern day athletes are just superior in every way, thanks to modern day training, diets, etc, and improved opposition. And those two just separate themselves from the pack, even by modern standards.",best NFL player

22558,"I worked for Harrison Ford's son Ben in his restaurant that lasted a few years in town. I was 14 at the time and a busser. One night the restaurant is completely reserved by one party. Turns out Harrison was coming to eat at his son's place. So, as I am pouring everyone their water, I get to the person sitting right next to Harrison and the water pitcher spills everywhere (the ice decided that it had had enough of the pitcher, and all of it poured out at once). No water spilled on anyone, but I start apologizing profusely anyway. Harrison is laughing his ass off and tells me that it is ok, don't worry about, no water got an anyone. He was very nice about the whole thing.",best celebrity

22387,"met Jake Gyllenhaal at stage door after his play off-broadway last february. i was super nervous bc he’s my favorite actor and had heard stories of him not being nice. we said hi and as he was signing my playbill a lady shoved in front of me and demanded he sign her playbills for her daughters and that she “just has to get a photo!” he looked so uncomfortable and kept looking back at me, but he signed them anyway. im only 5’3 and was 17 so i just let it happen because i hate confrontation and was a lil starstruck by Jake. 
Well he told her off and said “you’re going to have to wait because i’m going to spend some time talking to her *points to me* because you cut her off.” he then turned so he was fully looking at me and HE apologized to me for her behavior. i just about died. we had a short conversation about his work, i thanked him profusely, and we took a photo. i have so much respect for him for handling the situation so well and all of my nervousness completely evaporated",best celebrity
