"To be fair, he was a number three then..."
Thank you so much brother!
Makes me feel less sympathetic that he lost 1/2 his money to his wife
Hells yeah

"Not to mention you can use Fanatec's wheel, pedals, and shifter.  It also has one of the best modeled clutches in any racing sim.  It was also pretty and had a good framerate.  FM4 was impressive."
"Kim is my fave cause at the end of the day she‚Äôs the reason we are all even here talking together. I appreciate how she‚Äôs always nice to fans and her activism. 

Kendall and Kourtney are my least favorite. I grew up with white girls exactly like them lol."
I really liked dragon age inquisition. Also the new God of War (although it's more of an arpg.) Persona 5 is definitely a good one too.
"an action game. it‚Äôs not really comparable to an RPG like, say, The Witcher 3. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
"Quality wise they're both very similar with Randolph perhaps having an edge, what separates them is the more design options that Randolph has. I was able to pickup the 23k gold sportsman on discount a while back and I love them. I have gifted AO in the past and they are just as solid."
"Perhaps in retrospect, and to individuals. At the time, for the government and the country at large, it was plainly unacceptable."
"Can you point in the right direction, how do I get this ""color wheel""?"
"It will always be FT.  Living on campus has it advantages, but there is a lot more concentration of people living in those two towers than all the other dorms on campus.  You are close to IV and the Goleta Town Center.  If there bike ride scares you, you can take the bus."
More like extremely mediocre but kinda good piece.

I love the Bach Cello suites that Mischa Maisky did.
"Backpacks aren't something I'd worry about the fashion over, I think messenger bags work well for the typical college student. I got one from Serbags for like $70 awhile back and it's been a great little thing to have, I never realized how nice it is to be able to access it without taking it off. 

Just travel light, wears on the shoulders more."
Every Michael Jackson grunt.
"I checked John Mulaney into a hotel room once. He wanted to pay for someone else‚Äôs room so he was at my desk for like 5 minutes while I set that up. He‚Äôs a genuinely nice guy.

Edit: BuzzFeed stole my comment for a listicle and this is the most famous I will ever be."
Yup. Both companies are using the same design for aviators contracted by the US military in the late '50s.
Why the Ridley Scott hate?
Fuckin' Switzerland.
