37641,best Marvel movie,"there are probably 10+ comments in this thread that are slight variations of “I think BP is overrated”, just upvote the ones you agree with instead of restating the same comment over and over, it adds nothing to the conversation. Someone else said this in a comment here, but whenever BP receives praise on this sub, it’s like ppl are tripping over themselves to be the first to say it’s overrated.  

There are likely several reasons why a “crowd” of people, especially MCU fans on this sub, were unhappy it received so much praise. Some ppl genuinely think it’s overrated, some ppl were upset it was praised so much by critics over IW that year, some ppl really had major issues with the 5 minute CGI fight between BP and Killmonger and that drags the whole movie down, and some people just didn’t like that a black superhero was suddenly getting so much praise/attention. I’m sure that last one doesn’t apply to you or anyone you know, but it’s a reality. Seeing a group of ppl trip over themselves to post essentially the same comment that BP (the most critically acclaimed MCU movie and the only one with a majority black cast) is overrated feels racially motivated at least in part."
