56048,best action and adventure movie,I had a friend who was convinced that [their theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XKGhG0W0LQ&t=0m42s) was the same as that used in [Monty Python and the Holy Grail.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHDycUXzNs0&t=1m28s)  (They're not.)
7984,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I think that the MSI GL65 Leopard is a great choice. I would definitely go for it."
17062,best iOS game,I love seeing Melvor on any list.  I’m not huge into incremental games but damn MI is hella addictive.  Awesome that it’s free too with cloud save feature so you can swap between devices.  Interesting too the strats for tackling some of the later dungeons etc.  I can see myself playing it for a long time (already logged a few months into it and only just now diving into the dungeons / combat).
56560,best desktop monitor,"There comes a point where you just let it slide.  ""4k"" isnt actually 4k either. If you know what their intent is, then all is fine and dandy."

73438,best battery bank,"Replying to support Zendure as well. I even bought their larger tank version (26800), and it can power my USB-C ThinkPad for 1.5 charges."
35446,best alcoholic drink,"hillbilly lemonade:

this is a drink for a whole group but it's super good

* 5 lemons
* 1 cup sugar
* a full 26 of vodka
* ice

Roll the lemons to break up the juices then cut them into quarters. Put the lemon quarters and sugar into a 4L glass jar and fill mostly with ice. Pour in a full 26 of vodka. Wrap the jar in a tea towel and shake. The jar is ready once the outside of the jar is frosted.


Easily the best drink for groups out there.

edit: am bad at words"

5138,best home improvement store,"Home Depot is for ""raw materials,"" whether that's composite decking, a new shut off valve for the bathroom sink, or the tools needed to fix things.


Lowes is better for ""decor"" things. Bathroom hardware, light fixtures, ceiling fans, etc. I also got my patio furniture from Lowes."
25140,best spiderman actor,I hate tobey as spiderman horribly overrated.
21966,best celebrity,"He is, but I saw him reign it in really quickly around super shy fans. He could really vibe with how each fan felt so he could be whacky or more chill depending on who he was engaging. With me, he wasn’t too crazy at all. After a few drinks, he was still just cool until I started teasing him, and even so, I was never uncomfortable, and I never got the impression I was too in his bubble either. He can really feel people."
15157,best tree for the garden,"Not heard of buddliea, will have a read up on it. Thanks! Leylandii was my first thought, but I'd rather something I don't have to maintain a lot if possible. My parents had a big hedge of it, had a lovely time tasked with keeping it tamed!"
51293,best iphone case,"Apple Silicone Case (Red). I've been using variants of these for years, having switched between silicone and leather. Last one I bought was the leather folio, and didn't really find the price justified. So I'm going back to the standard silicone.

I would have gotten the clear case if it didn't have that disgusting ring pattern on the back."
1074,best ice cream flavor,I had to scroll down pretty far to find the correct answer. To celebrate I am going to eat a Klondyke mint chocolate chip bar.
35931,best alcoholic drink,got to love that macallan
37292,best amusement park,"I mean I live in Alexandria, I can't get to BGW without passing directly by KD. It doesn't surprise me that much. Basically everyone in Virginia either lives closer to KD or lives a similar distance from either park. 

I prefer BGW by a considerable margin but if we're talking ease of travel, KD is the winner by far."
1095,best ice cream flavor,Black Sesame.
47744,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"the 84 plus CE is different from the TI 84 plus C silver.  the silver is a piece of garbage.  that's the one that was a regular 84 with a color screen.  slow, clunky, just a big pile of nope.  not too long after that was released they released the 84 plus CE.  the CE is magical.  rechargeable, fast, just plain lovely.  

i know because i bought the 84 c silver, only to see the 84 CE come out like 6 months later.  it's been almost 5 years and i'm still pissed about that."
41958,movies like Inception,"Otherlife. Low budget, not the best actors. But I liked the premise. Not Primer by any standards, but still good."
