22496,"I chatted with Heath Ledger in a cafe/comic store place once. It was a kind of underground nook, really quiet, around 2006 I think because I remember Brokeback Mountain had come out and it was huge so I recognised him from that among other things. I‚Äôd got my coffee and book and went round to find a seat and I saw a handsome looking guy in the corner, which was weird. This place wasn‚Äôt really known for attracting good looking people. I sat in my booth but kept glancing at him every few minutes, is it him? Nah can‚Äôt be. No it is him that‚Äôs definitely him holy shit, type of glancing. I finished my drink then grabbed one more look at him, he caught me and waved at me. I went over and asked if it was him and he said yeah, he was reading Swamp Thing by Allan Moore so I said that was a good read, complimented his work on Brothers Grimm. He said thanks and asked if I wanted a seat. So I sat with him and chatted about shit from comics, movies to just life for like maybe an hour. I was 20 at the time and talked about a girl I was seeing, one of my first girlfriends and he gave me some advice and seemed genuinely interested. Super nice dude, seemed pretty unpretentious and happy to just relax without being fake for paparazzi.",best celebrity

65699,"AT&T has been doing massive improvements on their network with this first net agreement. Speeds have increased, coverage and etc. Verizon is still king. If AT&T stays aggressive like they are now, they could start nipping at the heels of Verizon with plenty of spectrum at their disposal. I opened a byod line with AT&T to test the service and so far its matching the service that I‚Äôm currently getting with Verizon minus that I‚Äôm able to stream at full HD with AT&T. Between the two, the cost is a $5 difference. My initial impression, I can‚Äôt go wrong with either one. The real test would be a road test to see how AT&T would hold up.",best phone service company
