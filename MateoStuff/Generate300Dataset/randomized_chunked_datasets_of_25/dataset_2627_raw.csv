If people can successfully make a story out of something they will. Do you think obama's minister is really a muslim terrorist who controls policy decisions? No? Well plenty people were talking about it anyway
I think I got about 100 ads for this game but never tried it. Now I have to find out for myself. First time I heard anyone bring it up. Thanks!
"Do NOT go with Nexcess...they just screwed up a simple migration on a bunch of my sites (May 2021). I just switched over to DigitalOcean and got complete control over my server config, files, etc...at least as close to complete control without having a rack sitting my house somewhere. Use https://m.do.co/c/d7bf9ba6a802 for some free hosting credits - I get some goodness too ;) - ...so far I really dig it, lots of different options (CPU's, storage, locations, etc.) and like I said, you're pretty much in control. edit: Forgot to mention plans (US-based IP address & storage) start at $5...hard to beat!"

"C920 pro is pretty good, got one myself...comes with a tripod too if you need! 720p 60fps is buttery smooth and has decent performance in low light."
"Interesting. I felt like at certain times of the day it was easier to grip, depending on the 'condition' of my hands lol like right after a shower or washing my hands I couldn't hold the damn thing at all. When my hands were more clammy during the day it was easier. The heaviness I didn't like but I probably could have learned to live with. Glad you're enjoying it though!"
Search for u/caupcaupcaup and his post history. He is OP of the guide.  I can’t comment on the post to tag you due to its age.

"College internships.  I did not go to a front office target school, but I had my first back office internship summer after sophomore year.  Made friends with the front office guys and then got an internship for the next summer where I received a full time offer afterwards.  Started in 2008 in a generalist banking roll but move to capital markets in 2010."

I have global entry for international flights as well.   Only 15$ more.   Def worth it for 5 years IMO.
"That is indeed how math works.

64 to 128 = 64Gb for $50

128 to 256 = 128Gb for $100

Except even worse, for the Pros it is $150 for 128Gb"
"Have you had a two monitor system before? I am just asking because I didn't like having two monitors. Maybe because they were different models. But I ended up going with a 34"" ultrawide and love it."
"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of a tasso ham ice cream I tried.

Personally, I've had textural difficulties with avocado ice cream due to the high fat content, but it works well if you've got a CryoJet.

As for carrot, I haven't had it, but I see no reason it wouldn't work. You could either go in a carrot cake direction or a maple- or honey-glazed direction. Personally, I think I'd either roast them for a more complex flavor, or juice them and make a sorbet."

I like you too.
"I second this. Also don't forget Hard Rock/Heavy Metal shredding, it sounds so awesome. \m/"

"that ending sucked. it felt like such a cop out. it was a great slasher movie up until then. [Spoiler](/s ""it was just as bad as ""OH IT WAS ALL ONLY A DREAM !"""")"
You don't sound funny at all.
Just FYI you can overclock most 60 Hz monitors to 74~75. Even more if you're using DisplayPort instead of HDMI.
"They just feel so much better!! None of that bumpy bit over your first or last toe, not overly tight anywhere, but snug everywhere. Very rugged, no holes forming at the toes. That’s my biggest thing with cheap socks - I always get afraid people will see the holes at the toes and think I don’t trim my toe nails or something. I grew up wearing hand me downs, and socks and underwear with holes that long lived past their prime. I love having nice socks and underwear to put on. 

Duluth makes some great comfy and breathable underwear btw."
Green Inferno is not an adventure movie. Unless your idea of adventure is watching people being eaten by cannibals.
