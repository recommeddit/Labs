You call these a workout song? Naw dawg. Try some [Liege Lord](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4C10T52DAs)! Or maybe some [Scanner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVXjXRGaNY8)? Pretty much an 80s speed/power metal will do.
Honestly I‚Äôd just stick to pc or either just wait for ps5/Xbox Scorpio next Holliday season.
"Oh, easily. Imagine you're watching Star Wars, and in the opening of A New Hope, a voiceover says ""Luke, the son of Darth Vader, sets out with his secret sister Leia to become a jedi and thwart the empire"". 

That's what the voiceover does. It flat-out spells out the major twists in the movie, and explicitly, not like *hint-hint* sorta thing. It's mind-boggling why it made it in, and threw me off when I first saw it, since I didn't expect the twist to be something they explained in the first lines of the film. 

I highly recommend Googling it after you've seen the movie."
Knott's actually has some of the best food found in theme parks.  They really go the extra mile for guests without the weird corpfeel of Disneyland.

"Progression has a lot of RPG in it where you get to build your skills and loadouts, including emphasizing different things like speed or strength or boy. 

The story is not choice-driven though, though there are side quests and things that are optional. 

That being said, it's a fantastic game that everyone should play."

SSH is as easy as typing the remote host name in nnn.

However, nnn has gone beyond SSH and the rclone integration literally lets you mount any cloud storage you have at the same ease - type the host name. Details: https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Basic-use-cases#remote-mounts"
"Me too. I went for the Pro *primarily* because the iPhone 11 is just too big for me (though I recognise there's a huge market for big phones anyway), but the screen quality is also an issue given I was coming from the 1440p OLED display on the Galaxy S8. I *could* notice the drop in quality from that. The stainless steel frame, frosted back, and telephoto lens are also cool."
"Why? We're as succesful as them in terms of trophies and actually our history is better spread than Bayern and equally compared to Liverpool. People forget we were very succesful in Europe in the pre Europe Cup era. And that we were the cursed team when it came to that tournament for decades, in the same sense as Atl√©tico can be seen now. 

Putting them before us it's just romantazing the fact that they won their UCL before us. 

EDIT: I thought you were talking about Liverpool instead of Milan, of course Milan are above us."
"I. Fucking. HATE. FIJI WATER.  
Everyone's like ohhhh its minerally its soooo healthy for you mm best water yes I ONLY DRINK FIJI WATER how dare u even get any other water and  


Its absolutely disgusting.  
I grew up in the midwest. Tap water was basically undrinkable in some areas. I went to a summer camp (International Music Camp at the border of US and Canada) and had some water from a fountain because I was super thirsty and immediately spit it out and went and paid for water instead (The next time I attended that camp I brought a gallon of my home tap water with me).  
My home tap water wasnt even that much better. Chemically-chlorine tasting.  
Moved to Oregon, nice tap water, doesnt taste like death most places.  
My dad bought a case of Fiji water for a road trip we went on to visit my Grandparents and I cracked one open because I was thirsty and I immediately thought I was going to barf. Sour to holy hell, overly mineralized, borderline salty, tasted like death.  
Thought I just had a bad one. Took a drink from my brother's Fiji water because it'd been in the cooler and was cold.  
Slightly more palatable but still disgusting.  


Fiji water SUCKS I dont care if its fancy and good for you it's overpriced and it tastes bad."
"RPG is a broad definition these days, is it third person open world games that you're looking for or any type of RPG?

I'd recommend all the Final Fantasy games pre-13 that you can buy on PS4. (FF8 coming soon)"
"Logitech c920. Its worth the investment from the beginning as a great budget cam and a cam that many streamers still use later into their stream careers. 

There are filters and luts you can download to make your setup more aesthetically pleasing. The real secret is you should focus on lighting for your stream."
I mix it with Coca-Cola and it tastes exactly like Dr. Pepper
"Hey guys I can really use some help!
What is the best deal (from Amazon or alike big site ) that offers a 16gb ram, i7 10th generation at least 512gb . Good speakers and 15.6"" screen are a must.
And not lenovo ( I have lenovo now and it has a problem running server client related scripts) 
About 900-1300$ .
Tnx helpers!"
"It's not radically different. 

A benefit is being able to omit a 3rd party http lib in the browser bundle saves Kbs.

We now have a good-enough-in-many-cases option that is **browser native**, and using it on the server adds no more overhead than Axios. 

It's ok if this doesn't motivate you. 

The `fetch` interface isn't as clean in an absolute sense. However it's not nearly as bad as I once thought. 

(I'm hoping to promote & share better `fetch` patterns than I was initially aware of. Some of the patterns I'm still working on - specifically timeouts, and upload progress. The interface design isn't quite right yet...)

Some people may want to move to modern & standard APIs. Eventually `fetch` might be easier to teach & find hobbyists with prior experience. (Meaning it'll be used from docs to framework examples.)"
