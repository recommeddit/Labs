47707,best state to visit in the United States,Definitely go during the State Fair in Dallas in the fall. But prepare your stomach should you partake of the crazy fried items they hawk during the fair.
29538,best game console,"You can use a controller with your PC so I think that's a bit of a moot point.  The game was also locked to 720p/30fps on console, so again, that doesn't really mean the console version is ""better"" (if anything, the pc version was better since you had the ability to remove those limitations with a mod).  GFWL was pretty much the only real downside of Dark Souls on PC.  Everything else was basically equal.  That said, Dark Souls is actually [abandoning GFWL and moving completely over to steam](http://steamcommunity.com/games/211420/announcements/detail/202985743519497275), so soon you won't even have to worry about GFWL."
19345,best YouTube video,"Dude uploads like twice a year, but every time he does it's some of the best quality stuff on YouTube"
70424,best major to study in college,"You get out what you put in to any education. 

If you take art and go out into the world selling your talent freelance, or get your dream job at a museum/gallery, you've used your education wisely. 

If you go into accounting, a seemingly very practical course, and then go out into the world and do mindless office-drone work that has nothing to do with accounting, well you are much further behind than that art major you made fun of for 3 years."
4521,best text editor,"Brackets is what I use on a daily, and I quite like it. Works for any language really."
62731,Best Data Science textbook,Do you have any recommendations on similar books for someone who rather use python?
51713,best iphone case,"I pre-ordered a loopy case for my 11 pro. Honestly the ergonomics of not actually having to hold my phone while being able to reach the far corners is not bullshit. I can practically fling it out the window at the drive through and never worry about dropping it. There are some disadvantages, this is obviously not the lowest profile or the best looking case you can get but the ergonomics trump everything for me after having used one for the past 3 years.

Villeneuve movies are worth looking into, I won't say which ones since they're all worth watching, but there's some definitely unexpected twists in his movies."

29587,best game console,"I feel like the Army of Two series (or at least the second one in the series; 40th Day) should be on here.

Some of the finest co-op gameplay you can find with fun shooting mechanics and customization."
61090,Best comedy show on Netflix,Maaaaan that show was taken from us too soon. Are you watching Marry Me? Same writer and some of the same actors.
45656,best gaming system,Two games I really enjoyed in the Xbox 360 are Fable and Halo! Look in to them! I know you will love them.
50795,best rap album,Yea I enjoyed the Benny album but I haven’t listened to it since. I keep on going back to the Dark Lo tape though. I think that is the better Fraud release of 2021.
55515,best action and adventure novel series,"Sanderson's Stormlight Archive promises to be pretty darn epic.  I've only read a bit of *Way of Kings*, but the whole saga is supposed to be ten books worth of epic high fantasy.  Could give WoT a run for its money."

42210,movies like Inception,"He's the master of mindfuckery. When I finish a Dick novel I tend to put it down, and sit in silence contemplating.

“Wake up to a hearty, lip-smacking bowlful of nutritious, nourishing Ubik toasted flakes, the adult cereal that’s more crunchy, more tasty, more ummmish. Ubik breakfast cereal, the whole-bowl taste treat!”"
