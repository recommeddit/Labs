59515,best perfume,I woulda guessed middle aged (Korous/Fahrenheit) that cares about showing off big dick energy lol
49396,best gaming monitor,"Ah that makes sense. I still have old games that I play on my Xbox, and I just sold my Xbox one x for $250 so I might as well buy the series x."
38743,best web browser,"i wish any other browser also has those capabilities like firefox. 

firefox on windows is just so better than ff on ubuntu. But, firefox sucks on Android. So being a Ubuntu & Android user, i am currently using brave.

if i was only using windows, i would have gone with ff"
19148,best YouTube video,I knew it was coming and I'm still crying
68366,best science fiction novel,*The Years of Rice and Salt* is my absolute favourite alternate history novel.
16026,best sunglasses for fashion,"I was gifted a pair of [Malibu Jim Venus Pools](https://www.mauijim.com/en/shop/sunglasses/cat-eye/venus-pools) and I fucking love them. I have very light, super sensitive eyes and I'm prone to migraines (eye strain is a trigger) so I *need* good sunglasses. If (heaven forbid) I lose or break these I will definitely repurchase MJ's, though maybe a slightly lower end model."
18600,best YouTube video,My favorite one of his is the alcoholic some rich guys tried to kill for Insurence fraud... But he just kept coming back!
71919,best movies with a cool twist,Older movies like this don't get the appreciation they deserve.  Have my upvote.
39875,best Chrome extensions,Gotta have those Nine-Nine cold opens.
7747,best laptop for general use,"I see. Sticking with a Mac device would actually be a great choice simply because the MacBook Air has great performance with the Apple M1 chip, plus it has a great battery life. But, if you'd like to go with Windows, I'd go with the ASUS Zenbook 13 on my list. Most laptops with 11th gen Intel CPUs have great battery life because of their efficiency."
19782,best workout music,Nier Automata OST
70192,best major to study in college,"I felt like it was weird that they had both fine art and studio art on the list, rather than just fine art as that includes studio art. I'm assuming fine art is exactly the same as studio art, but it also includes music, performance art, dance, and maybe something else? But then why do they have theater and drama under its own category if those things are included in fine arts?

And out of curiosity, do you have one full time job as a graphic designer and then also do freelance stuff on the side, or all freelancing?"
31161,best country to live in,"Do you guys even read? His list is pretty clear so why are you suggesting Switzerland and Nordics? Both are miserable 7 months out of the year.  

OP think about Portugal. I’m an American living in Switzerland and I can’t wait to get out of this place. Portugal is a near perfect match for what you’re looking to achieve. It’s my next stop."
54413,best artisan mousepad alternatives,Hoya's one?
59454,best perfume,Thank you! My curiosity is definitely piqued
14022,best place to get free books,I use ReadEra :)
31458,best country to live in,"China.

China is the future."
55378,best action and adventure novel series,"The Greatcoats series by Sebastien de Castell, definitely.
A trio of musketeer-like characters trying to rebuild the peacekeeping order they were part of before their king was murdered and it was disbanded.

Lots of witty banter and prettt much going from adventure to another adventure on their travel.

First book is not long and can be satisfying as standalone i’d say."
985,best ice cream flavor,It's supposedly the most popular ice cream flavour in the States.
58735,best cologne,"This is a massively inspiring post. Thanks for sharing, I will need to rethink a few things."
