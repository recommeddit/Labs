55744,best action and adventure novel series,You could check out The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach. They are novellas set in the Malazan universe but are much less complex and have a much smaller character list and are also a side stories so you don't need to read the main series. It's about the adventures of two necromancers and their long-suffering manservant.

56639,best desktop monitor,"All I think should be added is a small segment on [ULMB](https://www.blurbusters.com/faq/motion-blur-reduction/) and such near the adaptive sync category. All modern GSYNC monitors have it.

In a nutshell, it gets rid of almost all motion blur, but makes your monitor significantly dimmer, (Though to be fair, many monitors are very bright to begin with) and can feel a bit stuttery if your framerate is varying wildly. Though tolerance for fluctuation may vary from person to person."

73208,best Linux distro,"Hmm, different approach; try them all! It's like asking which vehicle for caffeine is for you-- only you can decide.

I like XFCE and tiling WMs because I'm old. Whatever you like doesn't preclude you from the libraries that support other WMs or DEs. It's largely fashion, and as such it only matters what you care for.

That said, if you go full GNOME 3.30.x, it's good to have something non-Wayland as an alternative so you can experience how normal X works."

lets go through just, idk, the top 50, i count:

37 rock albums

4 hip hop albums

3 soul albums

3 electronic/dance albums

2 pop albums

1 folk album

no country, no non western anything, no experimental, no reggae, no funk, no metal (in all of the 38 rock albums), and, most jarringly for me... NOT ONE fucking JAZZ album? are you kidding me? white music for white people, with only cursory (and hilariously limited) glances towards anything else."

It may only come out every 2 weeks, but the the information within is usually more accurate than not, doesn't dumb down issues by focussing on what the tabloids might, and offers insights into how things actually work in Britain (spoiler: they don't).

I'd wager 2 weeks worth of the Daily Mail, stripped of all gossip, editorials, and non-news, wouldn't amount to the 34 pages worth of information you get with the Eye."
