59776,best perfume,"Yes. Without a doubt Bandit by Robert Piguet is the greatest perfume ever created. I've smelled and tried virtually all that is to be smelled out there, including discontinued expensive rarities such as Bal a Versailles, and while many are great, nothing even comes close to the olfactory masterpiece that is Bandit."

30505,best Mexican war to study,"The War was inevitable due to border clashes.  

Prior to the American Annexation of Texas; Mexico had invaded Texas at least 2 or 3 times and occupied San Antonio.  

Mexico was struggling with debts to European nations France and the UK. 

Mexico had long standing internal issues prior to the Mexican War and after it through 1919.

The results of the Mexican War contributed to the American Civil War and the South's desire to create more slave states to balance the union.

The American Military was able to decisively defeat the Mexican Army in almost every engagement due to superior leadership and weapon modernization.  The Americans used many modernized Rifled weapons and had more effective artillery."

Yes. Practically everyone in my graduating class does all their ""online"" professional networking via LinkedIn.

49113,best gaming monitor,Take a look at the Pixio Px7 Prime or the new Px277 Prime (difference with the Px7 and Px277 is the 277 having a 1MS response time). Both are 165hz native and 1440p and I have two Px7 Primes. Runs beautifully with Freesync/Gsync/V-Sync.
31956,best hotel to live in,"There is no best. Every city has a wide variety of hotels in different locations. One chain does not have a monopoly on the nicest hotels, the best value hotels, or the nicest locations. Each location is generally independently owned and operated. And generally the platinum/elite hotel perks aren't enough to merit exclusivity (unlike airlines).

I prefer Marriott's because they offer good value (especially with the corporate discount codes available) at courtyards and marriotts. JWs internationally are nice and generally affordable. Starwoods are often over priced and offer diminishing returns in terms of value, but offer many more high end options (Westin, W, St. Regis). ICH varies widely-- there are some amazing ICs, but some abysmal holiday inns."
47481,best state to visit in the United States,"Went to Portland, OR for a week. Mainly so I could spend 2 days in Halloweentown and meet the movie cast. Childhood won"
