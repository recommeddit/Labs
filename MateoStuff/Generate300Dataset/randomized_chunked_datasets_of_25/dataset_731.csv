61369,"I would go as far as saying Persona 5 is more adult/mature than most games, despite the main characters being in high school. It deals with some dark, heavy themes such as mental and physical abuse, abuse of power, family problems, suicide, free will vs. determinism, and rebellion. It's not a game for kids, to be sure. A late teenager would probably be in a good place to get into the story (I kind of wish this game was out when I was a teenager, actually) but it's relatable to adults as well. I mean, we all went to school once. It gives the story a sense of familiarity. The characters are in that age of life change and finding themselves and their place in the world, which is the perfect perspective to view the game's themes.",Best RPG game on PS4

16305,"I agree. My first pair of Wayfarers lasted over six years including traveling the world with me, getting stuffed in bags, pockets, going swimming, getting dropped and generally abused on a day to day basis. They finally broke after I stood on them, no surprises there. 

People say they could buy 7 pairs of knockoffs for what I spent on my real pair. You know what, over 6 years you probably will buy 7 pairs and mine don't look or feel shitty. 

I just bought a new pair of Wayfarers to replace the old pair and couldn't be happier. They also came with a warranty so that if I break them in the first two years I get 50% off a new pair.",best sunglasses for fashion
