67556,axios alternatives reddit,"Not *changes*, per se, but I would expect there to be more and more security holes discovered as code ages and our assumptions become less and less true, and kind of like water, code that's stagnant is more likely to be of lesser quality than code that's at the very least maintained."

72139,best movies with a cool twist,WHAT'S IN THE BOX?
61369,Best RPG game on PS4,"I would go as far as saying Persona 5 is more adult/mature than most games, despite the main characters being in high school. It deals with some dark, heavy themes such as mental and physical abuse, abuse of power, family problems, suicide, free will vs. determinism, and rebellion. It's not a game for kids, to be sure. A late teenager would probably be in a good place to get into the story (I kind of wish this game was out when I was a teenager, actually) but it's relatable to adults as well. I mean, we all went to school once. It gives the story a sense of familiarity. The characters are in that age of life change and finding themselves and their place in the world, which is the perfect perspective to view the game's themes."
8752,best toothpaste,"Toothpaste is clearly a lie. They damage your teeth, that's why dentists recommend them, because they get paid for fixing your teeth. Trust me, I'm an Anti-Mask-Flatearther who wasn't brushed his teeth in 21 years."
11880,best gifts for dad,"Never really had one. If I did I think Id get him a sensible wood chopping axe. Maybe engraved with something classy, like 'kiss my axe'."
43300,best ad service for mobile applications,"The problem is we've been using our own home grown system since the company was conceived 10 years ago and if I go with one of the bigger players like GAM then my own internal ENG team will be relying on support forums and documentation when they need a real tech team to rely on. Please note we're not doing programmatic so if any answers have programmatic tied then that's not a factor for us. We are a consumer technology company with all native advertising, no IAB standard banner crap and all our buys are CPA based."
63005,Best online React course,"His advanced react course have adjusted for this, just a two second title screen and a whoosh sound, no music. I really enjoyed it!"
27786,best breakfast foods,"250 gram Beef patty with an egg on top.

Filling, good macros, cheap, easy to cook, tastes great. The important thing to remember is that there's no such thing as ""breakfast food"". Eat whatever you want, whenever you want."
18064,best Kardashian,Bc it just takes up space when theres only 6 options anyway
949,best ice cream flavor,Butter Pecan as far as traditional flavors go but Phish food by Ben and Jerrys is better.
16305,best sunglasses for fashion,"I agree. My first pair of Wayfarers lasted over six years including traveling the world with me, getting stuffed in bags, pockets, going swimming, getting dropped and generally abused on a day to day basis. They finally broke after I stood on them, no surprises there. 

People say they could buy 7 pairs of knockoffs for what I spent on my real pair. You know what, over 6 years you probably will buy 7 pairs and mine don't look or feel shitty. 

I just bought a new pair of Wayfarers to replace the old pair and couldn't be happier. They also came with a warranty so that if I break them in the first two years I get 50% off a new pair."
22789,best celebrity,"When I met him, he gave me the People's Eyebrow and pretended to be Mexican."
19245,best YouTube video,I'm to remember every man I've seen fall into a plate of spaghetti?!
