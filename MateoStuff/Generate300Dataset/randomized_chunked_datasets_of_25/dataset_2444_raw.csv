"Banjo. No seriously, the banjo. It's open tuned so it's not too terribly hard to become decent at and....seriously, bitches love the banjo."
Does GM need to replace every Bolt battery ever made or just repair them. Replacing them all would be mind blowing expensive.
"Phenylephidrine has been proven in many places to be *exactly* as effective as placebo. It’s literally inactive but because pseudofed can be used to make meth, it’s been caught up in the anti-drug craze and resigned behind the pharmacy counter."
"Do you have an iPhone? Apple Music is doing a free trial, and if you’re a student you get 3 months free."
Like I didn't need another reason to buy a poly6..
Found a spigen clear case and bought a black  silicone MagSafe. So far so good.
I’ve been here all my 20 years and have never had a Mars bar
"They say consumers should test their water and not pay for a filter that removes things that are not present in their water. If all you need is to remove the taste of chlorine, try an undersink filter from the hardware store. Just buy the cheapest one. Check the price of new cartridges and divide by the duration in gallons or months. You may find that the limiting factor is the six month replacement schedule and not the number of gallons passed through it."
"Ah jeez, well we may be SOL here on getting you my stuff OP, but I would still like to help out. Feel free to shoot me a dm!"
Red bull and vodka. Little upper with my downer.
"Any of these could easily change:

- Attack on titan
- Haikyuu
- Hunter x Hunter
- Jjba adventures 
- Your lie in April
- Devilman Crybaby
- Zankyou no terror 
- Kimetsu no yaiba
- Your name
- Sakura-sou no pet na kanojo 
 
Honourable mentions that I love a lot (this was hard):

- Tokyo Sinks 2020 (Very much loved this even though it gets a lot of hate)
- 91 days
- Erased
- Fairy tail
- A silent voice 
- One Punch man
- Tokyo Ghoul 
- Toradora 
- Violet Evergarden 
- Space Dandy

These are all anime I have finished and love alot. A silent Voice would be in the top 10 however, I wanted to keep it to 1 movie.

Anime I'm watching and would put into the top 10 as it stands:

- Wonder Egg priority  (could be one of my favourite of all time)
- Jujutsu kasien 

Any anime people can recommend for me to watch on what you'd feel I like?

Sorry for format. I used my phone :)"
"In the end, it only matters how heavily your school is recruited in regards to your major.  I'm majoring in accounting and went the CC -> state school route.  I'm enrolled at the #2 state school for my state, which is only a top 30 iirc.  I get offers from the same firms kids from top tier schools get.  In fact, I just signed a contract for an internship with a B4 firm and some of the kids who will be interning with me are from Ivy Leagues.  

Now, if I was going finance, this wouldn't be the case.  IB and the lot specifically pic from top tier schools.  Finance is an extremely difficult major when it comes to recruiting.  It seems you either go IB or bust your ass doing something else for little (compared to acg/CS/eng/SD) pay.

You are also 100% correct about networking.  The kids going to the big firms either know someone on the inside or they went to all the recruiting events and got to know everyone there.  Those are the people getting offers.  Take the time to do it, get the free food/drinks, meet your potential coworkers, and soak it all in.  The school will not ""put you in to jobs"".  You do that yourself.  They simply provide the floor for you to meet recruiters.  That is 100% it.  I wish more people would realize that you need to hunt DURING school to find a job.  It won't magically drop in your lap after you graduate with a piece of paper.

Just Google the majors you're interested in, what the work involves, how recruiting goes, etc. and make a move.  You still have a while to decide."
Sick i didnt know about this website. Thanks bro
"Thats a lot of broken bones, even divided among 5 kids... Although the multiple instances of pulling kids behind the truck explains things a little. Sweet idea!"
Spigen Mag Armor MagSafe case
The spigen clear case I got for the 12 pro max has the bumps.
"Do you switch up scooping hands, or do you have one giant forearm?"
"I've had some apple pie moonshine from a store that was pretty strong , I can't even imagine what homemade would taste like."
I agree with everything you said.

"Yeah I am not sure? Sorry my opinion differs from everyone else’s? For what it’s worth Anker has a dedicated AliExpress store so I don’t understand what the deal is? Glad to hear you’ve had a positive experience too, honestly my go to for every cable. Been super happy with them so far, super sturdy MFi cables too."
"A long charging cable, 
I saw prettymuch the exact same comment on a similar thread and thought I’d try it out - life changing lol"
"I still use Cydia simply because it still works well for me all these years, all the way back to iOS 4. I don't ignore the other package managers and their advantages, though, but I'll continue to use whatever works until it becomes outdated, or until the competition thoroughly convinces me to switch.

Nevertheless, I'm interested in Zebra. Can I import my repos easily there? And are there things I have to be aware of when switching from Cydia?"
It's a cultural thing. Cricket and rugby was mostly played by the white minority; football is far more popular among the black population. Transformation policies are attempting to redress this but it's slow progress.
"I understand your point, but I personally just think paper is a waste of resources. I've never fully understood why newspapers offer their content for free online. Now that they've done it, people just seem to expect it."
