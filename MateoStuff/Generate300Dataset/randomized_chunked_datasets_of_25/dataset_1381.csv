30269,best Mexican war to study,It happened. At least when I was I school that was the extent of it when I was in school.
42229,movies like Inception,"I believe I read a fan theory from /r/movies that Identity was basically ""The Three"" movie that Nick Cage was writing in Adaptation.  There was a bit more to it that included further connections with John Cusak but I forgot it."

45200,best items under $100,"My computer speakers. I used to buy the cheapest possible, whatever to get the job done. 

I splurged a couple of years ago and bought Creative Gigaworks T40 series II speakers on boxing day. Newer ones have bluetooth, but I can unplug my laptop and plug a phone into the aux cord.

The sound quality is unheard of. Its got so much punch, and I love how it doesnt have one of those massive subwoofer boxes. Highly recommend."

52509,best hiphop album,"I honestly don't listen to much rap, but I've tried listened to parts of some of the albums listed above, and they really don't sound like they compare. The Money Store is definitely the best hip album I've ever heard."
18919,best YouTube video,[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9caaas9ob8). It cracks me up every single time.
7725,best laptop for general use,"It is not actually Amazon selling it for $1,132. That's a third party seller. That said, when Amazon themselves restock it, it will be available for $999. I unfortunately don't know how long that is going to take."

20080,best workout music,"[This] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGd7mmhizwI) and [This] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tltYB4NJqC4). Oh, definitely [This] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_559977&feature=iv&src_vid=gkwpXipZUoE&v=26Rl096vMf0)"

71671,best movies with a cool twist,"Apparently, the production was halted for two days because of inappropriate behaviour on set by Spacey. Already then, in 1980-something."
3584,best college for research,"Niche.com for starters. I just went through this with my daughter and something we would have done differently is to look at the actual courses your degree would require, if you know your major. So many programs vary wildly in their requirements. She would have ended up at the school she chose anyway, but it would have changed the other schools she applied to."

25669,best cricket teams of all time,"Well, it *is* just my opinion. But there were lots of little things, you know? Not saying that there were teams that didn't have their fair shaer of knob-ends, but for all the talent and skill there was just too much lip, too many verbals, and sometimes the attitude spilt over into something that just didn't seem in keeping with the game. At my age I feel I'm firmly entrenched into the ""traditionalist"" camp. Besides, the last line of the paragraph is as good a qualifier as I can manage. Perhaps the pseudo-cloughism is poor, but I nevertheless felt happy to cheer India on in 2001.

Anyway, it is only an opinion. Not like Reddit has enough of *those*, is it? And for every single one there will be another 10 who disagree. If I prefer Lara to Tendulkar then that's up to me. If I would rather watch Malcolm Marshall then Glenn McGrath, so be it. If I would rather pay money to see Lloyd's side instead of Waugh's, who's going to deny me that?"
