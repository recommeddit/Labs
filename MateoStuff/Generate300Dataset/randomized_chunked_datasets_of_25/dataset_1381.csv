I splurged a couple of years ago and bought Creative Gigaworks T40 series II speakers on boxing day. Newer ones have bluetooth, but I can unplug my laptop and plug a phone into the aux cord.

25669,"Well, it *is* just my opinion. But there were lots of little things, you know? Not saying that there were teams that didn't have their fair shaer of knob-ends, but for all the talent and skill there was just too much lip, too many verbals, and sometimes the attitude spilt over into something that just didn't seem in keeping with the game. At my age I feel I'm firmly entrenched into the ""traditionalist"" camp. Besides, the last line of the paragraph is as good a qualifier as I can manage. Perhaps the pseudo-cloughism is poor, but I nevertheless felt happy to cheer India on in 2001.

Anyway, it is only an opinion. Not like Reddit has enough of *those*, is it? And for every single one there will be another 10 who disagree. If I prefer Lara to Tendulkar then that's up to me. If I would rather watch Malcolm Marshall then Glenn McGrath, so be it. If I would rather pay money to see Lloyd's side instead of Waugh's, who's going to deny me that?",best cricket teams of all time
