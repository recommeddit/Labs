23008,"I was at a knicks game and Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Lorne Michaels and Jeff Daniels were there. I was 11 or so and I walked up and asked for an autograph and they said no. Then my 23 year old smoking hot sister in law walked up and asked them for an autograph and they obliged. She then told them that they were assholes and they should be ashamed of themselves and she gave me the autograph in front of them.

> Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible 

I find durian to be not quite so bad as it's reputation, especially because there are different 'types' of durian, which smell to varying degrees. In ice cream the smell was pretty neutral. But the texture had transferred over too, and that was what really got me. I've had awful luck adapting to the texture of a number of southeast asian desserts (ais kacang ... *shudders*).",best ice cream flavor
