23008,best celebrity,"I was at a knicks game and Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Lorne Michaels and Jeff Daniels were there. I was 11 or so and I walked up and asked for an autograph and they said no. Then my 23 year old smoking hot sister in law walked up and asked them for an autograph and they obliged. She then told them that they were assholes and they should be ashamed of themselves and she gave me the autograph in front of them. 

It was the week of Jan 8 1995, Jeff Daniels hosted SNL that Saturday 

Edit: it was Tuesday Jan 10 and the Knicks beat the Pacers"

1491,best ice cream flavor,"> I have an extract of brandy butter I think

I just half a jar of it in my normal custard base :) 

> Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible 

I find durian to be not quite so bad as it's reputation, especially because there are different 'types' of durian, which smell to varying degrees. In ice cream the smell was pretty neutral. But the texture had transferred over too, and that was what really got me. I've had awful luck adapting to the texture of a number of southeast asian desserts (ais kacang ... *shudders*)."

64551,Best Nike running shoes,"Best thing about Nike is the returns process. You can safely buy a pair, try them outside and return them if they are not for you.

One of React Infinity, Pegasus, and the new ZoomX Infinity would be my choice for a standard shoe from Nike."

I am concerned about the quality of the water in my home and was wondering if anyone could tell me of a reliable manufacturer of these. How much does a good R.O. machine cost? Do you need to add minerals back to the water before drinking it?
