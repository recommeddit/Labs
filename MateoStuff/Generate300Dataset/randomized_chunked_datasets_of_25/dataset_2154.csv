60752,Best comedy show on Netflix,He’s filming his special tonight!
29985,best money managing app,"With your eyes covered, you can continue to believe that you aren't exposed to passive advertising every day."
29979,best money managing app,The only ads I see on Mint are for credit cards or investment tools
9753,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I've heard very mixed reviews. Some cool people live there, but it's expensive, the foods not as great as on campus, and there are a lot of write-ups. Are you a transfer or a first year?"
26588,best board games,"I'm only recently getting into board games (asides from playing a bunch of the classic family games when I was younger) and read a lot of great things about Pandemic Legacy. Just curious, but would it be too much to take in going straight to that without having played the base Pandemic game? Also, do you know of many other games that I would enjoy after really getting into Settlers of Catan after only a few times playing?"
56403,best desktop monitor,"Forgot to mention I was using ULMB with Siege, 220-300 fps on low with a 3080. Haven't tested anything lower yet."
10629,best suitcase lock,"Yeah, but at least you'll know if it has been opened. Unless they bothered to force the shackle back in palce, which can absolutely be done with the cheap small ones. But unlocked zippers tempt someone way more than a crappy padlock that requires a bit more work to get open. 

Same for your house lock, it can absoluetly be opened, the goal is to make it difficult and time-consuming, so someone will be less likely to try.

There's a suitcase belt, that looks like a car seatbelt, that can be opened by TSA, but it will have an indicator showing that it had been opened. There's a steel cable sort of thing as well. These things don't protect your luggage, but will let you know if it has been tampered with."
50683,best rap album,"There's actually another /r/makinghiphop tape in the works, but I think different people are making it since I'm on that new tape and this is the first time I've seen or heard about that 2020 mhh tape, and man this one we're working on is really coming together brilliantly so definitely check that out when it comes out"
36958,best roller coaster at six flags,"SFNE is my home park, and honestly I don't like Superman that much either because of the restraints."
63035,Best online React course,"I’m getting hooked on Traversy’s teaching style. I think he could teach basket weaving and it would be an enjoyable course lol.
I saw a 2021 crash course on YouTube that covers what looks like fairly modern React. (I spotted hooks in there) .. but otherwise it’s straight React. No Redux or other libraries.. just React.  
I’m taking Traversy’s CSS3 course at the moment on uDemy and I’m learning a lot in a short amount of time. If his React course is done as well, then I’d highly recommend it."
40451,best midrange GPU,Best budget GPU =/= Best GPU
59589,best perfume,"Wow, you're pretty much dead on!  I'm super curious what scents led you to those conclusions and why?!"
36149,best alcoholic drink,that sounds delicious....i'll have to try it
61269,Best RPG game on PS4,Wow really didn’t understand it this way. Does this not leave out a lot of important details?
59968,best perfume,"Weird that nobody in here mention Zara?

* **Zara** Night Pour Homme III Eau de Parfum"

49420,best gaming monitor,I have the money too and I have friends who play on one but not the other. Idk I may not be getting the gpu but I’ll see.
48461,best color to paint with,"I still like grey for walls and white for trim.  It photographs well, is clean and neutral to buyers.  Paint is one of those things buyers will change anyway so dont overthink it - keep it neutral and dont worry about it.  I will say to me accent walls are out and I dont use them anymore."
6602,best Netflix documentary,"1. Be Here Now
2. Icarus"
3393,best webcamera,"Revision: There is no need in having a webcam if you're starting.

You could be uncomfortable, your living conditions could be unsuitable or maybe what you do just doesn't need one. Ect, there's no pressure."
11807,best gifts for dad,Certain scotches as well. Glenlivet 12 is like $42 a bottle.
68322,best science fiction novel,"While not the case at first,  Heretics and Chapterhouse became my favourites in the series.

The prequels stink. The son is not the father."
58964,best perfume,"They are both great iris scents that get overshadowed by Lipstick Rose and Iris Poudre. I’m slightly allergic to the incense in Portrait of a Lady. I also forgot my number one from last year was Grand Soir MFK. I needed warmth in my quarantine, apparently."
