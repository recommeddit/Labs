70302,best major to study in college,"I love my biochem major, but I am constantly drawing / creating things in my free time. I'm sure I would've had a great time in the art field"
66635,best soccer team in the world,You mean football ?
49616,best gaming monitor,"I also recently went from a TV to only monitors. Even that is IMHO better, but not as much as going from a shitty monitor to a good gaming monitor.

So if your TV has good colors and contrast, it's still better than cheap monitors. IMHO.

But no where near as good as 144hz g / free sync."
45520,best gaming system,GTA V and Skyrim
14800,best romantic novel,Yes! Flowers in the storm is a favorite of a lot of people. Also her medieval series is excellent.

56906,best water brand,Lurisa spring water.
71384,best movies with a cool twist,Surprised nobody has said Lucky Number Slevin yet. I'm usually pretty good at seeing twists coming (not necessarily knowing what they will be) but that caught me so off guard.

55762,best action and adventure novel series,He says “very few” I’ve never read it but it may not have as many as you would like. Mostly a human war. Apparently.
9530,best toothpaste,"Do I need fluoride toothpaste if my local water already has added fluoride? Not a conspiracy nut, just curious."
21045,best workout music,Black skinhead is my deadlift song.
58693,best cologne,I like it a lot. It has the same vibe as tobacco vanille and spicebomb extreme to me.  It feels more round to those though. I feel like it lasts for quite a long time in the radius that I want it to be in. I actually prefer that it doesn't project like crazy. Same reason I like pretty much everything else in my list other than maybe Y EDP.

69822,best major to study in college,"Computer science, Electrical engineering, or the physical sciences...but more importantly get a good internship and acquire useful skills as a student. My husband and I both work in STEM areas and have such a hard time hiring. We desperately need students who know how to do something useful coming out of undergrad, and those skills just aren't really taught in the classroom. Make the best of your education by learning how to apply every summer."

70203,best major to study in college,"My plan is to major in Motion Design, which is a combination of Graphic Design and Animation, at a very successful school. They have an employment department that assists graduates in finding great jobs, and I believe the employment rate for grads is around 90%, so I'm not worried. You should chose a profession that interests you, not what's only going to pay the bills. What will save you in money will cost you in happiness."
3604,best college for research,"I did my undergrad at the U of South Dakota. It's a good school with a PhD program in many subjects, but far from a D1 school."

The chef was working on some stuff food projects and this guy went into the back opened it up and ate it. when i confronted the guy, he  kept on throwing out that he's the nephew of a famous actor, and i kept on asking him and who are you? but i don't think he got it that he's a nobody not his uncle."
