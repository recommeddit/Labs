40105,best Chrome extensions,"A personal favourite of mine has been [Find website used fonts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/find-website-used-fonts/lnebjgioddkafaldaaeooeghlcholnnp).  Pretty simple and easy to use as it automatically lists all the fonts used on a web page and also lets you type in some text to see a preview of your text in that particular font style. Handy for web designers and developers!

47823,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"If you intend to take the AP Calculus exam (either AB or BC), you will *need* to use a graphing calculator from the list that /u/yes_its_him linked to; for the other math-heavy exams, a graphing calculator is permitted, so it's best to get one for all of them (although the College Board will allow you to bring up to two calculators to the exam, maybe in case one goes bad).

---
I used a TI-89, which I enjoyed because of its ability to draw 3D graphs (2002, before I had regular access to the Internet), but one of the cheaper graphing calculators should work fine; I recommend becoming intimately familiar with that calculator, specifically with its syntax for integrals and elementary functions."

13384,best spreadsheet editor,"Was I supposed to write an essay for this? Because I can totally write up a computational analysis of a spreadsheet program. (Excel is closed source as I'm sure you know, so any analysis would be far to speculative).

Why should i bother though? Proving myself to people on this website doesn't even matter. I made an accurate observation, that people here are outraged about. And the only thing you can say is ""But I haven't seen you do it!"". Also r/libreoffice is totally a thing (although it's also shit). 

A bunch of children. . ."
