I'm enrolled at Champlain College for MS in Infosec. 
  
I originally started at Capella and switched after the first class to the traditional school.  I literally Google'd something like  ""top online masters programs"" and weeded out any school that wasn't brick and mortar, then researched the pros and cons from there.",best online college

Have you read book two? It's series and book will be out this month.

>Amy Harmon re-read binge. Harmon's stories are so different, from fantasy to historical and contemporary, and they're so, so good.

She is Queen of contemporary fiction. I just read Where the lost wander is American historical fiction (I don't like historical fiction) but I like this one.

Our beaches are beautiful and mostly undeveloped and some of the towns here have remained relatively unchanged since colonial times. 

The food here is also delicious. You have to try Eastern NC style pulled pork barbecue which is consistently voted top in the world. The seafood here is also amazing. goto  visitnc.com for good information.",best state to visit in the United States
68210,"**A Deepness in the Sky** by Vernor Vinge

**Startide Rising** by David Brin

**Chasm City** by Alastair Reynolds

**Fallen Dragon** by Peter F Hamilton

**The Last Legends of Earth** by A A Attanasio

*A Deepness in the Sky* is to me Vinge's best. Looking forward into a future locked in by our present understanding of technological and physical limits, where humanity can only spread so far before the limits of communication and culture stop any form of commonality. Then intersect 'out of context problems' (think Excession!) and introduce a horrible weaponised disease. So much extrapolation as well. Such an amazing book.

*Startide Rising* was my first taste of Brin, and may still be the best. The sequels diluted the galactic-spanning mysteries of this book to its detriment. But the dynamics between the human and dolphin crew coming apart at the seams are amazing. Heroism and evil emerge in an environment quite unlike any other.

*Chasm City* is Reynold's first tour of the 'Rust Belt', the remains of a system-wide civilisation destroyed by the terrors of a biomechanical plague that seems all to possible in this day and age with our internet security issues. The civilisation that remains still has its own issues, crooks, and adventurers. Chasm City plumbs the depths of high adventure with mindbending excursions in memory and loss. Highly recommended.

*Fallen Dragon* by Peter F Hamilton is one of his few standalone novels, and because of this, works very, very well. At a time when interstellar travel is closing down due to economic necessities, multiplanetary corporates are still keen on 'asset realisation' by extracting their revenue by any means necessary. Of the mercenaries employed by them comes to the realisation that a planet he has been deployed to may by the hiding spot of crashed alien. Parallel to the story, is a narrative on the mercenary's early life which ties into the contemporary story in startling and unpredictable ways. 

*The Last Legends of Earth* is a book that must be read to be believed. I can't do a description justice. Billions of years after the destruction of Earth humans are resurrected by an alien as bait in a trap in a cosmic war against one of the more horrific aliens in SF. Humans are told that these god-like beings are not gods, but they choose their own sides, and an adventure that transcends time and space entertains with both tragedy and triumph. This is one of those books to treasure...",best science fiction novel
