4023,best online college,"Like others have said, go with a brick and mortar institution that offers online degrees.  So many schools do this now.

I'm enrolled at Champlain College for MS in Infosec. 
  
I originally started at Capella and switched after the first class to the traditional school.  I literally Google'd something like  ""top online masters programs"" and weeded out any school that wasn't brick and mortar, then researched the pros and cons from there."
14480,best romantic novel,">Radiance (finished it last week)

Have you read book two? It's series and book will be out this month.

>Amy Harmon re-read binge. Harmon's stories are so different, from fantasy to historical and contemporary, and they're so, so good.

She is Queen of contemporary fiction. I just read Where the lost wander is American historical fiction (I don't like historical fiction) but I like this one. 
Have you read her fantasy novel ""The bird and the sword""?"
47150,best state to visit in the United States,"I would recommend North Carolina as, well, I'm a native.  We've got a good variety of things to do here and the people here are some of the nicest people on the planet. Our beaches are beautiful and mostly undeveloped and some of the towns here have remained relatively unchanged since colonial times. 

The food here is also delicious. You have to try Eastern NC style pulled pork barbecue which is consistently voted top in the world. The seafood here is also amazing. goto  visitnc.com for good information."
68210,best science fiction novel,"**A Deepness in the Sky** by Vernor Vinge

**Startide Rising** by David Brin

**Chasm City** by Alastair Reynolds

**Fallen Dragon** by Peter F Hamilton

**The Last Legends of Earth** by A A Attanasio

*A Deepness in the Sky* is to me Vinge's best. Looking forward into a future locked in by our present understanding of technological and physical limits, where humanity can only spread so far before the limits of communication and culture stop any form of commonality. Then intersect 'out of context problems' (think Excession!) and introduce a horrible weaponised disease. So much extrapolation as well. Such an amazing book.

*Startide Rising* was my first taste of Brin, and may still be the best. The sequels diluted the galactic-spanning mysteries of this book to its detriment. But the dynamics between the human and dolphin crew coming apart at the seams are amazing. Heroism and evil emerge in an environment quite unlike any other.

*Chasm City* is Reynold's first tour of the 'Rust Belt', the remains of a system-wide civilisation destroyed by the terrors of a biomechanical plague that seems all to possible in this day and age with our internet security issues. The civilisation that remains still has its own issues, crooks, and adventurers. Chasm City plumbs the depths of high adventure with mindbending excursions in memory and loss. Highly recommended.

*Fallen Dragon* by Peter F Hamilton is one of his few standalone novels, and because of this, works very, very well. At a time when interstellar travel is closing down due to economic necessities, multiplanetary corporates are still keen on 'asset realisation' by extracting their revenue by any means necessary. Of the mercenaries employed by them comes to the realisation that a planet he has been deployed to may by the hiding spot of crashed alien. Parallel to the story, is a narrative on the mercenary's early life which ties into the contemporary story in startling and unpredictable ways. 

*The Last Legends of Earth* is a book that must be read to be believed. I can't do a description justice. Billions of years after the destruction of Earth humans are resurrected by an alien as bait in a trap in a cosmic war against one of the more horrific aliens in SF. Humans are told that these god-like beings are not gods, but they choose their own sides, and an adventure that transcends time and space entertains with both tragedy and triumph. This is one of those books to treasure..."

34816,best NFL player,I think you got to put Kelce higher than the receivers. He had the number 2 receiving yards in the league as a tight end.
63059,Best online React course,"A pleasure. You will even save a few bucks. I used his 2018 tutorial version to learn React back then and got a job with it!

I  would still suggest to maybe look up redux a thad. Not long ago Redux was the standard so lots of ongoing project will continue to use it. Therefor, you might come across apps that use Redux (even maybe flux) in a future job!

Bottom line, React evolve really fast haha!"
40938,best instrument to play,"The hardest for me was the lip pain.

Reading is the easiest on sax as it is generally 1 to 1 and no counterpoint.  

But a person with no experience can play something on the guitar faster than on sax.

They all have different learning curves."

13178,best gifts for mom,"This is much harder to do but it is definitely the best idea IMO.  The last hour before my husband comes home and we are double parenting is the longest and toughest.  When he comes home and plays with the kids, gets them out of the kitchen so I can finish supper or takes them for a walk I could just about cry with relief and gratitude.  While gifts are nice taking over for an hour or two each evening (or morning) can go a looooong way to easing a stay at home moms stress level."
