"As always, Apple leather phone case"
I have fond memories of that trilogy by Christopher Hinz
"Thank you, I'm less than novice at gardening and pleaching scares me somewhat - I'll look it up but if my black fingers (things wither and die) have anything to do with it I might mess up. I love the idea though and think that it will be a slow process, ideally I'd love to rip the sycamore out and plop one right in - but maintenance is where I fall short. I'll watch some videos and see how I feel! Thanks again for your suggestions."
"I guess I really am not trying hard enough. Thanks.
If you don't mind, what did you end up hating and what did you go back to school for?"
"Vue.js is just as powerful and much easier to learn. I’ve seen experienced developers take weeks to get comfortable with React, but be productive in Vue in a day or two."
You can't tell the difference between a Play Station and a PC?
My name is Brian. I feel personally attacked.
The Witcher 3 and bloodborne. Persona 5 is also amazing but very story focused.

"Ya these guys do a great job, I'm glad we're past the constant negativity that was thrown at them in the comments the last couple years"
I jail broken with Chimera that has Sileo. I know Cydia comes with Chimera. How do I get Installer?
That's cool - it's definitely not for everyone.
It does not tell me when I get a update on a tweak really
"A wedding invitation between you and that nice girl I mentioned earlier to you.  You know, Sandy's kid.  She went to Wellesey and visits her grandmother every other Saturday.  She's a nice girl - why don't you really get to know her?  You both have a lot in common.  You both like the Facebook and listen to the same talking music with the African American gentlemen.

Have you eaten yet?  Why haven't you called?  I would call you, but I can't figure out this phone - where's the call button?

-Your mom"
[Knockaround](https://reddlink.tech/knockaround). Built very well for the price and lots of styles to choose from.
"That's some really useful info there lol, !thanks :D"
Dragon Age Inquisition? It’s very detailed and the process while leveling up is tedious but enjoyable at the same time.
"Id say get a freesnyc monitor thats g-sync compatible so you dont get the unnecessary price markup. I am looking to build a 1440p144hz build myself and Im going to use the Samsung C27HG79. https://pcpartpicker.com/product/z6YWGX/samsung-c27hg70-269-2560x1440-144hz-monitor-lc27hg70qqnxza

Heres a review of it: https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/chg70 I generally recommend this website if you want to compare monitors.

They should be working on a faster 165 hz version which might mean you can catch it on sale if youre lucky."
"Fireball. I know its bad for you, but it's so damn good"
Aren't they in Ventura also?
"Well shit, guess I better just kill myself then."
You sure you wanna do this for all of them? In the comments of this thread?
It may be worth waiting. The next console generation is coming out within the next 2 years and blowing money on something that’ll be obsolete in a year or two isn’t worth it

"In my opinion, there is no answer to this generally, as practice time is directly correlated to improvement on every instrument.

Now I will say if you're want to narrow the question a bit to something like, ""what instrument will let me play [genre] songs with the least time investment"", that changes things. I used to teach a rock camp for kids and I've had 6 year olds drumming AC/DC in a couple weeks without prior experience. It's not mastery or getting particularly ""good"" but they can certainly jam to the ol' 1 and 3."
