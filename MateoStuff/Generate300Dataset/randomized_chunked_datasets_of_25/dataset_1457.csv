41547,best instrument to play,Every instrument is hard to master. Some instruments are harder to start and get to the point and get to the point where a you can make sounds that any would want to listen to.

27432,best bollywood actor,"No doubt they are crowd pullers, and I’m even a fan of both, but the guys I listed at the top are more consistent. If I had to list them based on superstardom, then they’d be on top. I’m not saying they can’t act, they’re just not as good as those guys imo."
