You hook it to the back of the tube and roll it up as you use toothpaste. When you are done you pull it out, and there is NOT ONE GLOB of toothpaste left. Fucking black magic.",best items under $100

21988,Danny Devito. I ended up at a hotel bar in Philly with this girl I was hanging out with and her friend. Turns out the cast of Always Sunny was filming the 10th(ish?) season and staying at the hotel and hanging out downstairs. So girl’s friend flags down Danny as he’s walking by and he ends up sitting with us for a solid 2 hours. Buys us a couple rounds. And tries to invite the girl up to his hotel room. A weird turn but he also introduced us to Charlie Day so I’m calling it a win.,best celebrity
52756,"Agreed that Kanye should be on the list. Probably MBDTF, but maybe Graduation or Late Registration.

I love RTJ, and had as much fun at one of their shows last year as I've ever had at a concert, but I don't think any of their albums are among the best in the history of the genre.

GRODT was massive--I was DJing weddings when that album came out and it felt like ""In Da Club"" was the only song I played for a summer--but I don't think of that as a greatest album of all time.

The only other albums from the past ten to twenty years that are clearly in contention for the list, for me, are maybe GKMC or TPAB.  I'm a big fan of 4eva is Mighty Long Time, and that could maybe make my list. But it's tough for something that's only been out a few years, where the impact on the genre is hard to measure, to compete with something like Illmatic or Liquid Swords or Stankonia.",best hiphop album

I’m debating on Zero as I already have the Hien and need control, but I’m scared of the possible uncomfortable speed that comes with the Zero as I’m used to faster speeds (only used to fast pads, Glide and Hien, never used QcK or GSRSE or anything)",best artisan mousepad alternatives
