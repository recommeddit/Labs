"I don't think there is some elite brand of freezer you're going to get. My advice is to find one on craigslist. They are robust. 

I would highly suggest a temp alarm on it. I've had a door left slightly ajar cost me a lot of $$$ in meat before, the same could happen if your freezer malfunctioned. 

Frost free are less efficient and are more prone to failure."
"My recommended playing order

1- fire red and leaf green. No need to bother with the originals when the remakes are just better. FRLG are a great place to start. 

2- Black and White. Great game overall and is considered one of the best pokemon games. Has a great story and makes good use of the side characters. Its here at beginning because of whats later on the list


3- Pokemon platinum. Very solid game and has what is considered the most difficult champion. Just a better version of diamond and pearl. No need to get those.

4- omega ruby and alpha sapphire. The best of the 3DS era of pokemon and a very under rated pokemon game. Very fun and has great characters.

5- heart gold and soul silver. Probably the very best of pokemon, and has probably the most content. Is a semi sequel to FRLG which is why I put them on opposite side of the list seeing as how you will be exploring kanto again

6- black and white 2. Direct sequels to BW and ex0lorrs the same region which is why they are separated. Figures people could use a small break from exploring 1 region. Has the same quality as BW which is to say, it's a great game. If you can unlock the hard mode for it even better.

7&8-xy and ultra sun and moon. Whatever you dox dont get sun and moon. Ultra SM is just an upgraded version with the same story. There is literally no reason to get original SM. XY and USUM are what I consider the weakest entries in the series. Play them after you fall in love with pokemon cause they simply aren't as good as the rest of the list"
"Legitimate emails, believe it or not.  Sometimes I have to scrub lists to suppress names, or filter them for specific email providers.  In this particular case, the 1.4 million names is a company's entire inventory, collected over the course of 10 years.

I knew someone would ask that though. =D"

I was just working on my motorcycle last night and picked up my 10mm socket and thought “see ya later good buddy” as I knew I’d prob lose it by the end of the night. lol
A lot of people told me to try a Manhattan as my first! And I'll keep in mind about the mixing!
Aye that whole album is great!
"I grew up rurally without any other boys my age around and just a little sister.  I didn't play with her ass she sucks.  I like to think I turned out okay, learning to be comfortable is very important especially as an extroverted person."
That was such an underrated show!
True . It won’t be $100 anymore but your soul and your paycheck.

"You can find affordable running shoes on sale, but my point is when looking for the pair that fits your needs don't focus on butget, I get that not everyone has the capabilities of getting ""Zoom Vaporfly's"" but look for what you need. Examples are: are you looking for cushioning or minimalist, are they're going to be for long 12k+ runs or just jogging 1 or two miles here and there, asphalt, track or dirt trail, etc. good luck finding what fits you. There's many reviews websites that can help you choose what fits your needs"
"Lowes still had it originally listed 20% higher than the next most expensive place you found. So again, great deal you got but for anyone reading don't assume 40% off is really 40% off."

Contra Tiempo was great
I guess my best guess at the location of upstate New York would be the Syracuse region. This guess being based on no facts.
That's how it is at a lot of RIU resorts. Service is not the greatest but they will gladly accept tips and then disappear.
"Good list. I would also add the following book: ""**It's OK to Be the Boss: The Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming the Manager Your Employees Need**"" by Bruce Tulgan. I encouraged all new managers in the company to read this book. It contains a lot of practical advice and case studies."
