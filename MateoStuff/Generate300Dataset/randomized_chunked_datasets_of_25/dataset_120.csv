27055,best board games,I can do that! I’ll try and get that incorporated today.
15906,best sunglasses for fashion,Any brands you recommend? I figure it isn't taboo since you didn't offer any.
1347,best ice cream flavor,Talenti makes the best salted caramel in my opinion. They also make a damn good raspberry cheesecake. Carb and calorie heaven right to your mouth and gut.
28347,best breakfast foods,"* 1 cup rolled porridge oats
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1 cup water
* 1 small peach per person, chopped into chunks
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* Honey, to serve

Put the oats, milk and water in a saucepan on a low heat. Stir in the cinnamon, and keep stirring until the porridge has reached the desired consistency. Put half the peach chunks into the porridge and stir them in. Serve sprinkled with the rest of the peach chunks and drizzled with some honey. 

A recently discovered breakfast recipe that I've had every morning since. Delicious!"
37540,best amusement park,"Kennywood as well

EDIT: Also Kennywood and Hershey are like the only two parks I know of with two hyper coasters that are basically the same.

I mean sure dae point has SteVe, Magnum, and Valravn but those are pretty different but like Hersheypark has two airtime machines and Kennywood built two record breaking loopers.

EDIT2: made my point in edit1 clearer"
23067,best celebrity,"Fred Rogers (""Mr. Rogers Neighborhood"") was exactly like you'd expect him to be. He remembered my name meeting him again a few days later and also asked about my brother by name, who he'd also met. He had a minute or two for anyone who wanted to talk to him."
68072,best science fiction novel,I tried so hard to like Red Mars. I did.
73251,best Linux distro,I do not think my university cares that much about what we use. In case there is a need for a windows application or something goes wrong with Linux I will have windows ready (dual boot). But I would really prefer to move away from MS.
30796,best country to live in,"I feel like I'd love Iceland. I hate the sun, enjoy the cold and rain, and their politics fit me."
39913,best Chrome extensions,Lastpass. Its a password manager that keeps all your stuff secure. You can put in info for gmail accounts to drivers licenses and credit/debit cards. Inputting any new login information on chrome triggers a popup asking if you’d like to add whatever you just entered into your password vault. Also there’s a master password for each account that has some pretty strict security measures so your stuff will be safe.
41153,best instrument to play,"How cute, you seem to think this is a popularity contest.

37662,best Marvel movie,"Then why are they already talking about shifting the focus of the series to Shuri, if he loved the 1st one so much?"
17673,best iOS game,No need to grind like crazy...just play the game and enjoy.
12348,best gifts for mom,So sweet :')
5815,best programming language for web development,"For the back end, it depends on your choices.

You can use the old apache, mysql, or you can use node.js, django or even code your own web server with Go."
68180,best science fiction novel,"**MY TOP 10 SCI-FI**:

* Samuel R. Delany - Empire Star / The Ballad of Beta-2 (amazing stories and beautifully written)

* Ursula LeGuin - Left Hand of Darkness (just a great look at another culture through the lens of an observer)

* William Gibson - Count Zero (better than Neuromancer IMO)

* Charles Stross - Accelerando (really opened my eyes to the power of writing and what can be achieved with SF - Glasshouse is great as a spiritual sequel)

* Alejandro Jodorowsky / Moebius - The Incal (it is a Graphic Novel, but so very important in the SF landscape. If you haven't had the pleasure then pick it up now. There is a collected version in print now)

* Issac Asimov - Foundation trilogy (love the scope and generation-spanning nature of the storytelling. Some brilliant ideas as well)

* Theodore Sturgeon - More Than Human (moving, human story about outcasts with special powers. Love this book)

* Phillip K. Dick - The Man In The High Castle (such a great treatise on art and culture)

* Warren Ellis - Transmetropolitan (again a graphic novel, which can be unpopular on this sub, but something I think all SF readers would appreciate reading)

* Iain M. Banks - Matter (not the normal suggestion when people list their favourite Culture novels, but this one was subtle and really well done. Reminded me a lot of Ursula Leguin)

edit: added in reasons :)"
38550,best newspapers to read,I read it every Sunday morning and occasionally during the week. Mostly to catch up with the political updates of my country.
51236,best rap album,"Both of y'all said ""Cold summer"" lmaoooo"
21506,best winnie the pooh comic,Fuck.
14113,best place to get free books,"For my kindle, I get any book I want in any format from either the website op mentioned or b-ok.org. 

Then I use a program called Calibre. It's free. It converts my book files to the correct file for kindle. Then I email the file to my kindle from Calibre. Free books for the past 2 years has saved me so much money"
16800,best pet for toddlers,"Haha! Come to think of it, all the cats I've had have come when called. The two I have now know ""off"" and ""out you get!"". 

They have trained us humans to open the door whenever they say ""miow"". Sometimes they do this for no apparent reason - I think it is their way of proofing the command... ; p

> If there is something new in the house she has to check it out.

I love how the curious ones do this!"
12318,best gifts for mom,"For the yarn, make sure the same color is from the same lot number and don't just get one."
23967,best anime,"I have different ratings for different seasons of the same show. Movies aren't included but the Haruhi Suzumiya movie, maquia, and the 3rd madoka movie would be #1, #2, and #4 respectively if they are included.

1. Psycho Pass s1
2. Steins;gate
3. A place further than the universe
4. Barakamon
5. Full metal alchemist: brotherhood
6. Shinsekai yori
7. Planetes
8. Hyouka
9. Attack on titan s3 p2
10. TTGL

Honorable mentions: rezero s2 p1 at #11, and rezero s2p2 will probably make the list at around 5 to 9 if ""Choose Me"" is done justice."

Jessie Bates was this year's Kenny Clark for me, a guy that I never really paid any attention to who just blew me away on film. What a special safety class that appears to be with him, Derwin, and Minkah"
5959,best programming language for web development,"Yeah we generally all start out putting doing all our JOINs in PHP.  But clearly defining this stuff into VIEWs makes it much easier to debug stuff when you're not sure if the problem is your SQL queries, or the PHP code.  

Nice to be able to just look at the SQL VIEW in your database GUI to first check that it's giving the correct results before trying to debug PHP app code.

And also when thing get complex,  you can start layering multiple views on top of each other instead of having one giant query that is hard to debug.

Once you start realising the true power of all the cool stuff you can do in the database instead of app/PHP code, you can even get closer and closer to barely having much backend code at all, with things like: https://postgrest.com/ which can allow your frontend to just read/write to the database itself.  I haven't gotten quite that far yet, but it's a pretty interesting possibility for certain us cases."
