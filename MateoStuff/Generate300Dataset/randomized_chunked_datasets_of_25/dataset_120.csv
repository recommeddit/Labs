EDIT: Also Kennywood and Hershey are like the only two parks I know of with two hyper coasters that are basically the same.

I mean sure dae point has SteVe, Magnum, and Valravn but those are pretty different but like Hersheypark has two airtime machines and Kennywood built two record breaking loopers.

Also there’s a master password for each account that has some pretty strict security measures so your stuff will be safe.,best Chrome extensions

68180,"**MY TOP 10 SCI-FI**:

* Samuel R. Delany - Empire Star / The Ballad of Beta-2 (amazing stories and beautifully written)

* Ursula LeGuin - Left Hand of Darkness (just a great look at another culture through the lens of an observer)

* William Gibson - Count Zero (better than Neuromancer IMO)

* Charles Stross - Accelerando (really opened my eyes to the power of writing and what can be achieved with SF - Glasshouse is great as a spiritual sequel)

* Alejandro Jodorowsky / Moebius - The Incal (it is a Graphic Novel, but so very important in the SF landscape. If you haven't had the pleasure then pick it up now. There is a collected version in print now)

* Issac Asimov - Foundation trilogy (love the scope and generation-spanning nature of the storytelling. Some brilliant ideas as well)

* Theodore Sturgeon - More Than Human (moving, human story about outcasts with special powers. Love this book)

* Phillip K. Dick - The Man In The High Castle (such a great treatise on art and culture)

* Warren Ellis - Transmetropolitan (again a graphic novel, which can be unpopular on this sub, but something I think all SF readers would appreciate reading)

* Iain M. Banks - Matter (not the normal suggestion when people list their favourite Culture novels, but this one was subtle and really well done. Reminded me a lot of Ursula Leguin)

5959,"Yeah we generally all start out putting doing all our JOINs in PHP.  But clearly defining this stuff into VIEWs makes it much easier to debug stuff when you're not sure if the problem is your SQL queries, or the PHP code.  

Nice to be able to just look at the SQL VIEW in your database GUI to first check that it's giving the correct results before trying to debug PHP app code.

And also when thing get complex,  you can start layering multiple views on top of each other instead of having one giant query that is hard to debug.

Once you start realising the true power of all the cool stuff you can do in the database instead of app/PHP code, you can even get closer and closer to barely having much backend code at all, with things like: https://postgrest.com/ which can allow your frontend to just read/write to the database itself.  I haven't gotten quite that far yet, but it's a pretty interesting possibility for certain us cases.",best programming language for web development
