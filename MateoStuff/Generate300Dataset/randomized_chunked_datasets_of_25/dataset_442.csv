46361,">How many pieces of candy do I hand out per kid? Does it change based on age?

Different houses do different things.  One-per is normal, though.  It certainly doesn't change with age.

>Do I let kids pick candy from a bowl or do I drop it in their bag?

Depends.  If you have lots of different kinds of candy, bring out the bowl and let them choose.  If you have just one, do either one, because both are accepted.

>I've purchased about 250 pieces of candy (good stuff like mini versions of starburst, snickers, almond joy, butterfingers, etc). Is this enough?

Ask your neighbors.  We don't know what the population density of your particular suburb is, nor how far from home parents are willing to let their kids wander in their never-ending and ever-futile quest to sate their insatiable candylust.

>I'm too lazy to decorate or dress up. But how do I make it clear I'm giving out candy? Just turn on the lights and keep door open?

Leave the lights on, that *should* be enough.  Kids tend to travel in large packs in part because it makes walking up to potentially unwilling houses and ringing the doorbell less scary.  At least, that's a big reason my friends always traveled in groups of 5+ on Halloween.

>How long do I have to stand by the door? I was thinking 5-8 pm.

Well, there's typically ~5 minutes between each pack of trick or treaters where I'm from, so pull up a chair.  5-8 sounds about right, but unless you've got some compelling reason to leave the house or go to a different room, why not just surf Reddit five feet from the door until the trick-or-treaters stop coming or you run out of candy?

>What happens do I run out of candy?

May God have mercy on your soul.

>How do I prevent people from TPing my house?

You're in Texas, right?  You're going to want at least two trained bloodhounds, a shotgun, and as many hours at the range as you can manage to squeeze in between now and Halloween night.  In all seriousness, giving out good candy will help your cause, but some kids just want to watch the world burn.",best trick or treating candy
