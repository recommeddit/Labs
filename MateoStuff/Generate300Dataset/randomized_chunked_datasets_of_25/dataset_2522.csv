62966,Best Data Science textbook,I just picked up The Flaw of Averages by Sam Savage. Its a pretty interesting read from the statistics side.
49353,best gaming monitor,i have 2 of these and they're wonderful.
27018,best board games,"I also feel like this curve matches the big boom of new players that happened 5ish years ago.  There are a ton of fantastic pre-2016 games that often don't appear on these lists because so many people are trying to get through the list of games that are still in print and easily findable at the stores.  I mean, who will want to review a classic that's been 10 years out of print that no one can track down without paying a premium?

Overall though, this is a solid list that I feel does a better job than BGG at showing quality of a game than popularity of a game."

Don't get me wrong, it's a great show with a unique premise and great animation and music, but the reveal didn't feel as big for me. I still get sad over it."

22114,best celebrity,"Taylor Swift - met her after the 1989 show in my city. Super nice and easy to talk to, felt like we were old friends. But what was crazy was she knew the guy standing next to me just from Tumblr (this was back when she used it a lot and he ran a TSwift fan tumblr). She knew his name, knew all these personal details about him and was really excited to meet him! It was very sweet."
70539,best major to study in college,"Graphic design major

Best: I love developing new ideas and flexing my creativity. Potential career field is looking pretty good. The major allows me to develop my portfolio with guidance from my professors. Rarely take tests or quizzes.

Worst: Professors grading your work can be pretty subjective. ""Oh, so you're an art major."" Also you either pay for Adobe Creative Cloud yourself or you go to the library all the time to get work done."
