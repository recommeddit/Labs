27018,"I also feel like this curve matches the big boom of new players that happened 5ish years ago.  There are a ton of fantastic pre-2016 games that often don't appear on these lists because so many people are trying to get through the list of games that are still in print and easily findable at the stores.  I mean, who will want to review a classic that's been 10 years out of print that no one can track down without paying a premium?

Overall though, this is a solid list that I feel does a better job than BGG at showing quality of a game than popularity of a game.",best board games

Best: I love developing new ideas and flexing my creativity. Potential career field is looking pretty good. The major allows me to develop my portfolio with guidance from my professors. Rarely take tests or quizzes.

Worst: Professors grading your work can be pretty subjective. ""Oh, so you're an art major."" Also you either pay for Adobe Creative Cloud yourself or you go to the library all the time to get work done.",best major to study in college
