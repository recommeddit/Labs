Can't live without it!
I went on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney with Tony Hawk. He had given me his autograph earlier at a convention and we just happened to be in line together. He was really cool.
Is that just more likely to be due to over eating?

"They’ve really got an urban/suburban congestion problem but their network across the rest of country still manages to balance it out. AT&T is countering their lack of density with spectrum and it’s surprisingly working well on paper, but everyone seems to gloss over the detriments of poor cell density."
Also a good choice for blowjob compilation videos.
"I see. I'd say that the Gateway 14.1"" is the best choice on my list, but the brand is not very well known these days. The alternative is the ASUS Vivobook 14, and ASUS is more well known. The downside is that it has less RAM."
"I agree with you about 90%. I started with a c270 myself and, yes it was ""good enough"", but now it's a year later and I have 2 c922's and a GoPro that gets used occasionally and the 270 is a $20 paperweight. 

I had the money on the front end for the 922 and wish I had just gone with it from the start, but if you, or whoever, doesn't have the money then the 270 is a great little budget camera. That's assuming you spend the $30 you saved on lighting for it. You could buy a DSLR and it would look like garbage if your lighting isn't right."
I moved to BFE. AT&T was ok if I was at my house but nowhere else if I got past my driveway so I switched to Verizon. I'd go back to AT&T if I ever moved back to town.
Try the anime Paprika and Millenial Princess
"that is not true seeding.  it is not using an opened port at the end of the VPN outgoing server node.

you cannot have a forwarded port for DHT to work, using NordVPN."
"In BW and onward the games are slightly more story focused \(meaning slightly more linear\), so they are easier to get into and complete. I recommend going back a gen and play either XY or ORAS. \(of course if your ok with basically the same game \[except the postgame\] your could play Ultra Moon/Ultra Sun"
Hey someone's got the cold vein on here!
Loved that movie I liked it more than Upstream Color something about the dialogue makes it so real. Plus to see some engineers make a time machine by accident and it’s not some chrome cover aesthetically pleasing machine made it very realistic.
Toast + peanut butter + apple slices + cinnamon
Merkur 34D. High quality and good for beginners
"Opera has inbuilt adblock and a free VPN. Both work on mobile, too"
"so king of dragon pass or six ages, if you can only choose one?
(i’ve already got king of dragon pass, so seeing if i should sink in more $ if it’s more of the same)"
I don’t see it either. *scratches head*
"I was delighted by those two making the list as well. AH 2e was the first board game that really got me into dense, thematic gaming. Especially of the cooperative kind. That was like, 12 years ago but I still remember being completely enamored by it. The horror and storytelling aspects of it absolutely blew me away. 

I love 3e too but I think it will be so much better with the release of more expansions. I’m excited for that. 

EH is a beast. Get ready for a clustercuss of a game. The rules aren’t super crazy but once you get them down, it becomes a very fun, immersive game where anything can happen. Every expansion can be permanently integrated with the base game and they’re all really good, in my opinion. Each one adds so much more to the game. I hope you enjoy it!

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk."
