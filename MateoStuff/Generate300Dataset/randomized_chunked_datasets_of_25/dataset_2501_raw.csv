"Bleach is an intermediate level disinfectant. It's not the ultimate germ-killer that most people think it is. For reference, hydrogen peroxide is one of 5 high level disinfectants recognized by the FDA."

Beautiful by Estée Lauder!
See thats what I mean.  Correct me if I am wrong.  I dont remember hearing about US soldiers moving into mexican territory
"Books, lots of travel books. I'll also get her an Amazon gift card so she can order some TV shows on DVD. Easy and it makes her happy."
Also '12 monkeys'
Given that most aftermarket GPU has a fan stop mode when idle I don't think it's a major issue anyways. Unless your music programs uses gpu for some reason. I would probably be more worried about coil whine.
Bangladeshi crowd is amazing.
"naah. We had too much time on our hands those days as viewers. Much more relaxed lifestyle. Lol.
Test match used to be 5 days with a rest day in between after day 3.

3 days of play + a rest day + 2 days."
"Main takeaway should be once you know the active ingredients, buy them at the dollar store and save a *shit load* of cash."
"Biscuits and gravy if I'm making breakfast on the weekend. Or pancakes, but the biscuits and gravy are my favorite. 
Country fried steak if I'm eating out for breakfast."
"I had a chance to work with Witney Houston for eight days on a film set. I was working as an extra. She was nice, kind and personable. Her beauty was more striking in person. 

She was very professional she did not miss a mark or a cue. Everybody on the set cried when she sang. Whitney Houston was very nice to me and complimentary she spoke sweetly and in a motherly tone when she greeted people. I can still rememer her friendly greetings when she arrived on set every day.

That was one of best experiences of my life and best experiences working on a film set. I learned a lot from her about professionalisim on a film set. I also saw how hard she worked. She was there twelve hours a day and on point every minute. I watched how she interacted with the director other actors and crew. She was even encouraging to other actors and performers in the film even the extras.

It was heartbreaking when she passed. I still have the dress that I wore in that film she admired and complimented me about the dress. An actor/ musician I know was booked to perform at the event Whitney Houston was to be at the day she passed he was also staying at the same hotel. He called me and told me she was gone then he started to cry."
"sorry for commenting on an older post, but would the acer aspire 5 be recommended for light gaming (stardew, mc, and moderate genshin on very low graphics) and the occasional video editing? im mainly looking for a low budget laptop for school purposes, but if it can take the criteria listed above, it would be a big plus"
Pep's Barca or Brasil 2002.
Coconut (w/ a scoop of chocolate)
I want it for coding
Been using the Spigen Thin Fit for almost as long as they’ve been making them.
Edge is trash. Because its made by MS
"There really isn't any exceptional restaurants if you are comparing to major metro areas like LA/SF. With that said, there are some good places.

- Lucky Penny/Les Marchands/Lark are all owned by the same group and are all very good
- Arigato for sushi. Sakana is pretty good too, but my vote goes to Arigato.
- Sama Sama with cocktails before hand at good lion is a good pairing
- Honor Bar in Montecito is really solid
- Outside of SB, but SY Kitchen is San Ynez is fantastic. Industrial Eats in Buelton is also incredible."
"spent so long only looking at desmos graphs that i was looking for the perspective point for a solid 10 seconds lol, good site but i want to see yours :)"
Which is rubbish unfortunately...
"I'm a Lego collector. I have a Lego room in my apartment. I've spend over $25k in the past 4 years on Lego. My mom asks;
""What do you want for Xmas, you're so hard to shop for""  
""Same thing I've always wanted. Lego.""  
""But you have all the Legos (it's not LegoS, it's Lego, but whatever) you want.""  
""There's no such thing. Even if I already have the set, I'll gladly take two.""  
*Cut to Christmas*  
""I got you these Legos (grr) from a truck stop. Look, they light up!""  
I smile, holding a box of what is obviously not Lego. ""Thanks Mom."""
"> on. If you're just looking for something solid and can get an Aqua control plus cheaper, I'd probably do that. Ac+ is my universal pick for something other than artisan, but truly I think one big purchase of artisan gets you into end game 👍. Thanks! yea i know I would use it for a long time so it seems kind of worth it but it still feels hard to justify. I live in Canada and with our dollar being monopoly money and duty fees going crazy its rough out here"
What's a good example?
