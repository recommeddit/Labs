You could have her volunteer at an animal shelter so she gets time around pets and also gets to understand the responsibility that goes into taking care of them.
Watching Movies with the sound off had some incredibly producing
It just sounded like pieces of different Kanye albums quickly thrown together

That's the trick. Use a hammer and you'll never have to clean them again.
So glad to see that someone did something with Paesano's. That dude that used to own the place made me not want to get food there.
Nice repost. Even used the SAME fucking link.
"Most of the appeal, for me, was Simu Liu and Awkwafina. I want a D+ series of them hanging out. I could watch them all day."
Voice and drums are more satisfying but piano and guitar are waaaaay more impressive.
"For `fetch`, you might want to replace that

    if (res.status !== 200) {
    }

with

    if (!res.ok) {
    }

`res.ok` will be true if and only if the status code is greater than or equal to 200 and less than ~~400~~ 300.

I'm pretty sure you know and just made a typo, but you'll also want to `await` that `res.json()`."
Man that middle order is stuff of dreams
RICH GANG THAT TOUR PT 1 IS A CLASSIC

It varies from person to person.
Vivaldi it's got great customization like theme schedule and tab placement plus it can use all chrome extensions
This Poland Spring bottle I have right now says 100%
"I’d vote no on hamsters personally. 

They’re just a mess. They can escape (neighbor just cut through her drywall because somehow hamster got in there and then couldn’t get back out), they don’t always do well in pairs (had 2 growing up. Well 1, who always killed her partner so a rotating second hamster), and they get the shits and die pretty easily (niece upgraded her hamster to a dog when it died a week after they brought it home). One of my friends got one and her therapist was like ‘wtf were you thinking? Never get a hamster!’ Lol. 

I know you said space is tight, but a small dog might be a good fit. Particularly if you can find an older one that is good with kids. We had our Pomeranian in 2 NYC apartments that were like ~800 sq feet and he was fine with it. He got walks twice a day and mostly wanted to sit near the window and sunbathe."
Wasn't any better under Koeman though was it? We have been laying like shit for years.
"Well, you want an animal you don't have to exercise or groom or take outside to potty... that's not a dog."

"Boston Massachusetts, best aquarium in the world. Plus am winning if you're up for it."
I've tried it and it's pretty decent overall but again  it's not very esthetically pleasing :(
"I'm glad at least one of the groups listened to you.  I've met a lot of folks who do SAR/PSAR, and they all seem to agree that people greatly overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the environment.

For my part, I'm totally okay if everyone else on the trail makes fun of me for being overprepared.  I'd rather be the nerd who takes extra water, snacks, a headlamp, a first aid kit, compass and topo map, and layers on a simple 4 mi. hike than risk becoming just another statistic.  I've also had to give folks some of my water on more than one occasion (too many people seem to think a 20 oz. bottle of Dasani will be sufficient for a 5+ mi hike in the desert or mountains), so I often carry an extra bottle tucked in my pack."
"The last one WOULD be here, but he died of tooth decay."
