45263,"I honestly can’t recommend gamepass enough. It’s a bit like Netflix, but with games. And the Microsoft exclusives are on it permanently. So that would be gears of war, halo master chief collection and 5, forza horizon 4 (a racing game), the fable series, plus a lot more 3rd party games. Some of the games on gamepass are garbage, but a lot of them a great. They usually have deals on gamepass as well like the first 3 months for £1 (which was the deal a few weeks ago). 

If game pass isn’t for you I’d recommend halo the master chief collection as it’s halo 1-4, forza horizon 4 is one of the best racing games ever made and set in the U.K. as well, the bioshock collection is great, as is the batman return to Arkham. GTA5 and red dead redemption are both fantastic as well.",best gaming system

33511,"> The best EV but not be best car that is an EV.

Coming from an owner, this is the best short but sweet assessment of Tesla. Other companies do *car* building better, because they have a vast amount of that experience. They make more intuitive designs, better build quality, etc. - the downside is that they also don’t dedicate all their resources to EVs and while they’re getting *extremely* competitive, it’ll take a little more time for them to catch up the the big lead Tesla had.

Tesla’s advantage is that they *only* build EVs and infrastructure, and have reap the benefits of having that be their only focus in their model lineup. The cars are top notch from an engineering standpoint, but in practice, quality control is a huge mixed bag, sometimes their designs aren’t user friendly, and their tech company first mentality means you have to be ready to put up with their way of “doing things just because we can,” (and the company is run like a dumpster fire).

Teslas are great if you want cutting edge but are willing to put up with crap for it. Other brands are great if you *just want a car, that does car things like your previous cars, but an EV* and are okay with being a bit behind cutting edge.",best electric car

If you want to whiten your teeth, but risk the sensitivity that may come along with it, use whitening toothpaste.

If you have sensitive teeth, use sensodyne/pronamel.

23672,"Forza Horizon had a lot of customization but IDK if it's really what you're after since things are so easy to get in that game. Blink three times and you've got 6 super cars. That kind of thing. 

Some people saying NFS Heat but IMO the newer NFS games are abysmal. Even if they have some decent customization you have to sit through the cringe dollar store Fast and Furious cutscenes and it's just not worth it to me. The old games were great though. 

The Crew is just... no. At that point you might as well just go with Forza since they do the arcade thing way better and have better open worlds. 

I guess you could go with F1 if you're into that kinda thing? 

Come to think of it there really is a lack of new, great, immersive racing games with meaningful progression where you feel like you have earned everything you've got.

35367,"If you like Laphroaig 10 (which, incidentally, is my favorite scotch) you owe it to yourself to try all the Islay malts. Lagavulin is the nearest to Laphroaig in character, but they're all special in their own way. Read up on what makes Islay malts so distinctive, I guarantee it'll make you fall in love with them. Skye and any coastal higlands have similar virtues, and there are a smattering of other island malts worth trying. If I can lay hands on any of those, I'll pass over several more expensive bottles from other regions of Scotland.

Also, try Japanese whisky. It's made with similar ingredients and similar methods to scotch. I don't know much about it, as I'm just beginning to discover it, but I've never tried one I didn't like.",best alcoholic drink
