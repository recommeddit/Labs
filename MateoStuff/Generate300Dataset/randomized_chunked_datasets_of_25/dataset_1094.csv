70701,best movies with a cool twist,That's one you start watching again immediately because there's stuff right from the start to be noticing with a new perspective.
45843,best trick or treating candy,"Worst:

Circus peanuts, candy corn, milk duds. I'd rather have circus peanut/candy corn soup than eat a bag of fucking milk duds."
45263,best gaming system,"I honestly can’t recommend gamepass enough. It’s a bit like Netflix, but with games. And the Microsoft exclusives are on it permanently. So that would be gears of war, halo master chief collection and 5, forza horizon 4 (a racing game), the fable series, plus a lot more 3rd party games. Some of the games on gamepass are garbage, but a lot of them a great. They usually have deals on gamepass as well like the first 3 months for £1 (which was the deal a few weeks ago). 

If game pass isn’t for you I’d recommend halo the master chief collection as it’s halo 1-4, forza horizon 4 is one of the best racing games ever made and set in the U.K. as well, the bioshock collection is great, as is the batman return to Arkham. GTA5 and red dead redemption are both fantastic as well."

19522,best YouTube video,"Have a seat with Chris Hansen

Edit: I also recommend Sam O’Nella Academy"
53866,best medicine for a cold,"I'm sorry if I sound like gullible as fuck but does rum or beer or any other alcohol in small doses actually help? 

Other than that, you should rinse your mouth after brushing with warm, salty water. That should help with sore throat"
33511,best electric car,"> The best EV but not be best car that is an EV.

Coming from an owner, this is the best short but sweet assessment of Tesla. Other companies do *car* building better, because they have a vast amount of that experience. They make more intuitive designs, better build quality, etc. - the downside is that they also don’t dedicate all their resources to EVs and while they’re getting *extremely* competitive, it’ll take a little more time for them to catch up the the big lead Tesla had.

Tesla’s advantage is that they *only* build EVs and infrastructure, and have reap the benefits of having that be their only focus in their model lineup. The cars are top notch from an engineering standpoint, but in practice, quality control is a huge mixed bag, sometimes their designs aren’t user friendly, and their tech company first mentality means you have to be ready to put up with their way of “doing things just because we can,” (and the company is run like a dumpster fire).

Teslas are great if you want cutting edge but are willing to put up with crap for it. Other brands are great if you *just want a car, that does car things like your previous cars, but an EV* and are okay with being a bit behind cutting edge."
51815,best iphone case,"I sadly was up to 5 or so cases the first week. 

If Apple would stop being lazy and release the battery case I wouldn’t need to be looking at all these other fancy brands!

Seriously Apple! I need all day charge !

63289,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Sorry, yes. You cannot just update unc0ver."
32803,best free online grammar checker,"Prowritingaid has a lifetime subscription available, while most others are monthly. 
It's helped me muddle through a Byzantine project of mine, works very well with Scrivener.
The Chrome extension wasn't so great."
9508,best toothpaste,"Dental student here.

If you want to whiten your teeth, but risk the sensitivity that may come along with it, use whitening toothpaste.

If you have sensitive teeth, use sensodyne/pronamel.

If you just want to take care of your teeth, any toothpaste that is approved by the ADA and has fluoride as an active ingredient will do. The biggest secret to taking care of your teeth is to not horizontally brush and don't brush hard. Youtube the modified stillman technique."
54435,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"> Raiden and otsu v2 seem to be unique, haven't noticed many similar ones out there to compare to

Have you tried the (coated) Aqua Control+? IIRC it has similar properties to what you describe in the Otsu V2, and I'm curious about where the comparison would fall."
17784,best Kardashian,"Worst to best IMO if we’re basing it on your description: Kourtney (worst hands down), Kylie (young and really only cares about herself), Kendall (just a bitch to simply put it), Kim (has grown on me so much throughout the show), Khloe (most relatable/understanding)."
56630,best desktop monitor,So this seems to be the place to ask it but what about curved monitors? How do they play into all of this? Is it just an aesthetic thing?
52214,best hiphop album,"Yeah, well that’s just like, your opinion, man"
43884,best items under $100,And no limitations to what you can display...
23672,best car racing video game,"Forza Horizon had a lot of customization but IDK if it's really what you're after since things are so easy to get in that game. Blink three times and you've got 6 super cars. That kind of thing. 

Some people saying NFS Heat but IMO the newer NFS games are abysmal. Even if they have some decent customization you have to sit through the cringe dollar store Fast and Furious cutscenes and it's just not worth it to me. The old games were great though. 

The Crew is just... no. At that point you might as well just go with Forza since they do the arcade thing way better and have better open worlds. 

I guess you could go with F1 if you're into that kinda thing? 

Come to think of it there really is a lack of new, great, immersive racing games with meaningful progression where you feel like you have earned everything you've got. 

We could do with Test Drive Unlimited 3 right about now."
15044,best romantic novel,"No one has said this yet so I’m nervous I’m a major dork.

I liked Annette Marie’s Shadow Weave series and her other Steel series."
49509,best gaming monitor,"The [VG240Y](https://reddlink.tech/acer-vg240y) is great. Although if you're willing to go to 4K, the [LG27GL850](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-lg-27gl850) is amazing and worth it."
43321,best ad service for mobile applications,"Yeah i wonder what actually happened. My fill rate is back again now, but still have the warning"
35367,best alcoholic drink,"If you like Laphroaig 10 (which, incidentally, is my favorite scotch) you owe it to yourself to try all the Islay malts. Lagavulin is the nearest to Laphroaig in character, but they're all special in their own way. Read up on what makes Islay malts so distinctive, I guarantee it'll make you fall in love with them. Skye and any coastal higlands have similar virtues, and there are a smattering of other island malts worth trying. If I can lay hands on any of those, I'll pass over several more expensive bottles from other regions of Scotland.

Also, try Japanese whisky. It's made with similar ingredients and similar methods to scotch. I don't know much about it, as I'm just beginning to discover it, but I've never tried one I didn't like."
