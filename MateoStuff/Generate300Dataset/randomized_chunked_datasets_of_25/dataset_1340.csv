24099,"This is a great question! I'm currently in a parallel situation to yours, where I'm trying to get my fiancee into anime, or at least share with her shows that are good enough that she'll enjoy despite them being anime. So I'll suggest:

* Madoka Magica - this has been mentioned a lot of times on here. I think the story is good enough to stand on its own even if you haven't seen a lot of anime, but if you HAVE seen any magical girl shows, it is really going to blow your mind. If you're at all familiar with Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, that kind of thing, it adds a whole new layer of whatthefuckery to this one.

* Death Note - based on the anime that you've listed I think this is one you should definitely check out. Two brilliant minds - one a budding sociopath with supernatural killing powers, one a brilliant detective - clash through a series of escalating twists and turns. As others have said, it falters considerably in its last arc, but getting there is a great ride.

* Trigun - This is a bit like a seinen version of a lot of things you like. It's showing its age, but it's genuinely funny in an old-anime kind of way, and has a lot of thematic similarities to Fullmetal Alchemist. I'm actually surprised this connection doesn't get drawn more often. Even beyond the superficial similarities (wandering heroes encounter specific trials in various places, MC has blonde hair, a big red coat and artificial limbs, etc), the two series deal with some of the same ideas - loss, loyalty, what must be sacrificed for power. You could also describe Trigun as ""silly space desert Batman,"" so if that sounds interesting, you might like it.

* Berserk - This is the anime that got me into anime. Fantastic action sequences, great characters and fantastic (if old-school) animation. Be warned - this anime can be extremely upsetting, especially toward the end, but it's a great story of honor and brotherhood.

* Cowboy Bebop - This is generally regarded as the best anime of all time, and for good reason. This is the one to show people that don't like anime. If my fiancee didn't irrationally hate everything set in space, I would have shown this to her first. It's got incredible writing, characters, cinematography, animation, music, everything. The Dub is FANTASTIC; I actually cannot watch this show in Japanese.

* Akira - It's a movie, and again, pretty dark, but this is THE work that defined modern anime and basically the West's relationship with anime ever since. Amazing animation and soundtrack. The story is pretty divisive - there is a lot of technobabble that doesn't get explained and the background is intentionally kept pretty sketchy, but the whole story's a metaphor anyway so it doesn't really matter.

Honorable mentions - I would call these ""must-watches"" if you're looking to get more into anime, but maybe these aren't ones I'd jump right into when trying to introduce someone to the genre:

* Neon Genesis Evangelion - it IS that good, and it IS that important. Turned everything that mecha anime (all the Macross, all the Gundam) on its head and paved the way for a lot more thoughtful anime to follow.

* FLCL - watch it AFTER you've seen shows like Evangelion - you'll appreciate it a lot more. Also goes well with Gurrenn Lagann, which I can't recommend only because I haven't seen it yet! It's next on my list.

* Ghost in the Shell: SAC - maybe the smartest anime I've ever seen.

16613,"Exactly! And if you get them young they are actually fairly easy to litter train. Like a cat or dog it all depends on if you actually put the effort in while they are young and trainable! 

As far as space goes, if you put the effort in and train them then they are great as house pets (like a cat but without allergies for most people). 

As far as them being delicate/easily hurt, if you get minis yes, but get regular size and they are great, get them young and hold them ALL the time they learn to love people!
