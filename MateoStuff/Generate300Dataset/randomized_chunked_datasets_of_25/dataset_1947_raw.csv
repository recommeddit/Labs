"Tequila, soda, splash of pineapple. Tastes good and it’s never given me too much of a hangover!"
Gecko Linux (wich is Opensuse) Tumbleweed.
Spigen 100%. Apple's over priced cases look great but they are insanely expensive.
"Sorry, I was talking to /u/LordTwinkie . My bad."
"I once saw a guy who looked like Dee Synder.  When I asked if he was Dee Synder he acted offended and was a dick to me.

So until I meet the real one, Dee Synder is a dick."
"I have an SE 2nd version, since my original SE died a year ago. Bit disappointed by the form factor (its significantly bigger than the original) but otherwise a decent phone and hundreds cheaper than most of the other IPhones."
"Zicam spray.

However there is a twist.  Zinc is very interactive with the sense of smell and taste.  In some cases, people are afflicted with a horrible malady so that everything they smell or taste is like garbage, but this can sometimes be corrected with zinc, restoring smell and taste to normal.

But like those who lost their sense of smell, too much zinc can be bad.

And yet with another twist, a common medical problem today is too much copper in the system; which can be corrected by taking zinc."

It was an adventure movie but it wasn’t exactly fun.
"My opinion is irrelevant.  I have not even used an iPhone 11 or any phones on the market.

My point is the article itself says iPhone 11 is ""the best phone for most people"", not ""best phone to buy right now"" like OP's title says."
"Yep. I’m american and always pick up sensodyne outside the USA. It has a compound called novamin in it. It’s the fucking BOMB. 

FDA hasn’t approved it because they want more proof of the “repair” aspect in the title but no one else cares. Stuff is great. I travel outside the USA enough to make sure I always have enough but it’s also like $6-7 on amazon/eBay. 

Look for sensodyne repair and protect with Novamin."
Paisley is just Glasgow's jakey wee cousin.
From women? None.
"Works, you my friend are amazing!"
"Uhmm...
> Plus it can do anything you want-- melody, harmony, rhythm, you name it.

Single note, legato crescendo/decrescendo. XD"
Surprised that The Martian didn't make the list.
Sublime for quick stuff and VS Code for everything else. I used to love PHPStorm but it got so slow and awful.
"I think it's really a question of 'what level' the library should work on. If you're just interested in sending raw HTTP requests and responses, you probably should be using fetch.

A higher level lib might have a better understanding of the actual meaning of certain HTTP responses, for example:

* Provide auhtentication support
* Retry automatically when receiving a Retry-After header on a 503 or 429.
* Follow redirects transparently
* Provide a cache and serve from cache

That said, any exceptions thrown could still provide access to the response by providing a response property on the error object.

It could be argued that a true HTTP client understands more about http than just plumbing request and response objects, but whether they _should_, really depends on design goals.

I would really like to see a middleware-type ecosystem that adds opt-in functionality to fetch, so we can pick and choose which features we're interested in."
"Ooh man they make so much cool stuff... Once my deal closes, I know what I'm getting. I'll probably just be wearing it with anything though, complementing outfits with different glasses is just a little too high level for me atm."
That's a lot of words and no action or proof.
"For some things, it's impossible / very difficult to collect evidence.  (you can't do RCTs in the social sciences, for instance)

If you want to ignore those areas, suggesting that it's impossible to reason about them, that's scientism.  We *do* still have ways to reason about them, and ignoring an issue rarely helps.

The proper approach is to recognize that specific areas are [outside the remit of hard science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science#Defining_science), continue on as best we can with the tools that are available, and acknowledge that the conclusions won't be as rigorous as the hard sciences but we did the best we could."
"Well, you did

 *Puts on sunglasses* 

get trolled..."
"I have thought this for a while and actually just verbalized it for the first time to a friend last night; Lowes is to The Home Depot what Target is to Walmart. I shop at both of them regularly and even though Lowes is slightly more expensive, I would much rather shop there than The Home Depot. The only thing I do not like about Lowes is how they setup their hand tools in the front of the store but you have to walk through a maze to get in and out of that section. I'm sure they are doing this to prevent theft but it's a little overkill for me."
That's in by default!!
"You might would love an Ultralight Pro, but you’d need to find a used one. You can check on r/mousemarket for generally the lowest prices outside of Facebook/craigslist

Finalmouse’s shape leaves the most room on the sides of any lightweight mouse. The model o makes my hand cramp but the ultralight is very comfortable. 

Only problem is it’s ambi not ergo."
