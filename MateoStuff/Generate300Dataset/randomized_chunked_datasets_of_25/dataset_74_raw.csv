I think only the first Arctic Monkeys should make this list. The Moon and Antarctica should be on the list however.
"South Africa and Australia respectively.

In fact, SA had a W/L of 1.800, which is not that far behind India's."
"When I use milli-Q water for my experiments, I have to degas it to get any last bit of dissolved gases out. It always amazes me how how pure the water can get, and how even the slightest impurities can affect my results."
"If a woman has starch marks on her- wait a minute...

If a **women** has... **starch masks** on her body, does that mean she has been pargnent before.?

Edit: Corrected the phrase"
"I got mine from Whitestone on Amazon. $15, comes with 2 protectors, and so far it has been really good.  I love the way writing feels now, but more importantly, the tapping noise when using the pencil has been reduced a lot."
"DS2 is great!   
But... it is quite a controversial game xD   
You like it or hate it.   
You can google ds2 vs dark souls and you will find quite a lot of diskussion how ds2 is no dark souls and so on..."
"In no particular order 
Someone to Watch Over Me by Anne Berkeley
Sweet Filthy Boy by Christina Lauren

"I use money dashboard and it’s fantastic! You can easily view your spendings in pie chart format, break it down into sub-categories and also set budget spending limits on each category. Links directly to your bank account also."
"It's not fast enough for things like the Samsung Dex that can stream 4k video to a 4k monitor, you need 3.0 speeds for that, and your file transfers will be faster as long as your target drive can support the speed. So any computer with USB 3.0 ports and a SSD will benefit."
"Stetson all I can say is WOW! This is awesome.

I decided to try US Mobile 5GB @$19.91 per month for 5 GB data with unlimited talk and text. Unless throttling becomes an issue (VZ infrastructure is in abundance all around me) this seems like a halfway decent ""set it and forget it"" minimal effort deal.

What u/mrpickem1 wired up on the AT&T Prepaid 8GB Annual is awesome and I may consider that if I need more than 5GB or performance is problematic. Also note: Best Buy currently offers a 10% store credit/discount on prepaid cards."
"Sex Education, Atypical, Grace and Frankie, I am not okay with this 

Dark isn’t a comedy but I loved that show."
"When someone comes to your door throw it open violently, scream at the top of your lungs, throw a handful of candy bars at them as hard as you can, then slam the door shut.  The next day post your results here on reddit.  I will then disavow all knowledge of this advice."
"Yay we got a dolphin on there! Hopefully he plays this year, I think our team really needs him"

Dental hygienist here."
Space shuttle status: confirmed.
Or complaining that a country music magazine snubs Slayer or Public Enemy in their lists.
"Those who hand out Candy Corn and/or those who claim to enjoy that orange, yellow and white vileness ought to be stocked and pilloried."
My inner mom says she was crying because you got her a present and she was touched. My kids never get me anything (their Dads fault) so any gift would seem very thoughtful.
Maybe people here just don't know what it is lol
