I bought a knock off brand recently and it smells terrible. Like rotting corpse terrible. I can’t use it but I’m saving it just in case I get super desperate.
"I'm using a Logitech BRIO. Excellent webcam, but can be problematic for non-Windows users if the firmware is 2.x - they improved functionality for Windows users, but killed it for other operating systems where a phantom second device appears and you get mic drop outs (firmware 2.7 introduces video drop outs too). Any BRIO on 1.x firmware works perfectly, however.

Shame really, since it's such a pricey camera and such a good picture. Oh, and Logitech don't care about the non-Windows market, so they don't allow you to downgrade the firmware either."

it was really  u/smallquestionmark 's discourse skills all the way.. :)
Yea I agree! Dil to pagal would not be as iconic if not for the music. Regardless I think it’s a good movie tho
"Can't recommend this enough. I hate anime, I hate cringey teenage stories where adults=bad and I'm not a fan of JRPGs in general.

So why the fuck can't I stop playing the game for the past 3 weeks?"
Are people just missing the part where I was talking about for profits?
I hope he does The Top 100 again.
I used ranger forever. I heard about nnn and I'll be trying that one soon. Only other one I kinda like is [**Last File Manager**](https://www.linuxlinks.com/LastFileManager/)**(lfm).** But you can't forget about Midnight Commander(mc)
"As a Delaware native, it's safe to say that 80% of it's residents have had some kind of encounter with Joe Biden, all of which are amusing and/or adorable.

EDIT: The 20% who don't have a personal encounter with him know at least three people who have."
This is my earliest memory of internet culture and it holds up.
Basically springs added to a rubber dome.
"Definitely a good thing for you, enjoy it. I'm no anti-music person, don't get me wrong - it's a pretty big part of my life, it's just that I find it hard to concentrate on more than one thing at once, and music so easily pulls me in so it ruins what I'm doing at that moment."
Never had a manager tactically astute enough to guide them through to the latter stages of the Champions League on multiple occasions when they were consistently qualifying for the competition.
[Ray-Ban Erika Metal](http://www.sunglasshut.com/us/8053672587692) in gold. They go with everything yet add interest and the shape is great for my oval face.
"Agree with trial run suggestions in previous comments. Tends to be the most sure-fire way to know what another carrier would be like where you are. Prepaid SIMs give an idea of cell coverage (though may not reflect postpaid data speeds in all markets, congestion and buildout depending).

If you haven't already, you may also be able to glean some interesting perspective in your area using Rootmetrics, Open Signal, and Cellmapper."

The Handmaiden. So many twists and turns all throughout.
"Once had the opportunity to meet Samuel L. Jackson at the golf course I worked at in TX. He is an absolute joy to be around. He tried to stay low key and not have people go out of their way for him. Just when he was leaving after I cleaned off his clubs my buddy asked if he could say ""his line"" from Snakes on a Plane. I can say that was the only time I was happy to hear someone say ""Get those motha fuckin' clubs, in my motha fuckin' car!""

tl;dr Samuel L. Jackson - Confirmed badass in real life."

"I've thought about that.  There's nothing against it other than they'd probably be bored during the day while I'm working.  I knew a guy that traveled with his girlfriend for a while.  I'm for it if I met the right person.

I'd love to have a dog, but I just don't have the time.  It would be unfair to the dog."
A blender is the wrong way to do it use a whisk and a double boiler for the hollandaise and you can even use that same water to boil the eggs
