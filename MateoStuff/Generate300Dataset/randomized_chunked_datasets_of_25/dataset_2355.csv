65254,best phone service company,"This is a cool chart! Hello, Mr. Stetsdogg. I have a question for you.   
When the carrier states multiple carriers is that in list of priority for that plan?  
Thanks!"
35878,best alcoholic drink,"Belgian beer. Best beer in the world.

(A few favourites would be Chimay Blue, St. Bernardus Abt. 12, Westvleteren 12, Waterloo and Tripel Karmeliet - that last one is really sweet and tasty, but still has a good deep beer taste. It’s great!)"
73204,best Linux distro,"Dont think, just Ubuntu.
Later you can hop wherever you want."

70820,best movies with a cool twist,"This! And then you’re like “that was the twist?! that’s so dumb” because you were expecting something crazy. I was doing what OP is trying to do earlier this year, went through a bunch of twist movies and I didn’t enjoy any of the twist because of my pre knowledge of a possible one"
41931,movies like Inception,"Whoops....

Not...Mr. Magorioum's Wonder Emporium

I meant the imaginarium of doctor parnussus, which i know it seems like if a movie is good you'd remember the name, but seriously it is good.

Thank you /u/toastedfart

Surprised to not find it here. Used to be on netflix not sure anymore.

It is heath ledger's last movie and he died during shooting."

10195,best pencil for drawing,"If you're using the non-photo blue or poppy(maybe crimson) red pencils you must be wanting to scan your sketches? That's really about the only reason I think you would *need* them (unless you just like the way they draw, which I do, lol). If scanning is your plan, don't worry about their ability to be erased, because the whole idea behind the reds and blues is how easy they are to remove in photoshop. 

As for erasers, I really like the standard issue Staedler white eraser...its an o,d stand by. Also get yourself a kneadable eraser too because they can be super usefull. Also try sticky-tack. We used that in college when we were too poor to afford kneadable erasers, and they turned out to be oretty awesome at the job."
13470,best spreadsheet editor,"I do a lot of interactive VBA stuff. I have macros that are started from graphical interfaces that read in local files and upload processed results to a midrange database server, run following queries on that external server, download results and generate local report files.

I'm not getting any of that done in Sheets."

73077,best Linux distro,"""Pretty subjective""? Yeah, you don't have a clue about what you're talking about, but you feel that you are here with in the Arch and Manjaro turf and any fanboyism of this kind is automatically accepted."
59571,best perfume,"You probably enjoy making a proper impression when meeting new people. Not too bland or approachable....you'd prefer to make a firm statement without shouting it. (I am sorry, I am bad at guessing.)"
42124,movies like Inception,"Just watched this again today. Tip top movie. But the ""mindfuck twist"" aspect of it is easy to miss"
5859,best programming language for web development,"Alright, thanks! Any idea in which order I should learn them?
