I personally like polyphia or my workouts
"4k 100hz+, with good HDR implementation (OLED or FALD) for $1000."
"I hire a proofreader for nearly all my paid projects. When time or budget doesn't permit, I try to let the work settle for a day before proofing it myself. I also use Grammarly."
"No. Step and sleep tracking only (and notifications for your phone if you want those too).

With only step and sleep tracking you can wear it over a month between charges and it's totally waterproof etc though so it's largely wear it and forget it which is it's biggest selling point along with the very low price (20-30 bucks)."
"Tea, tissues, teddy bear. Then more tea."
"I haven't even seen Homecoming, but I know the only answer is Tom Holland."
/u/pompsy this could probably go in your OP for the MM threads
"I go to Home Depot for building materials and Lowe’s for fixtures. HD has typically better selection of building materials, but Lowe’s has more on trend decorative items like light fixtures, planters, etc."
Stratovarius - Dragons has been with me through various phases.
I am almost positive you did this incorrectly. If you took out LAC's then Emory would be 21 on both US news and WSJ and a few other irregularities like Columbia and such.
"That doesn’t mean the fish are low maintenance. To give them a happy, healthy life fish need some very specific care. Keeping them healthy is like running a years long chemistry experience that’s very finicky and needs a lot of adjustments."
"I knew he wouldn’t be this high up, but how the hell is Tyler Lockett not on this list?? So underrated."
"I wish I could upvote you more for K.A.A.N.

That dude is like no other. It's also awesome how much music he puts out on soundcloud."
Right. Rama II was....decent but kinda like the Hyperion series it failed to deliver at the end
Bagpipes. You only need to learn that one song they play.
"I want to make sweet, sweet love to his new show."

I have an excellent picture in that same exact spot from about a month or so ago!
"Read anything by Brandon Sanderson.. it's all top notch stuff. I started with the [**Mistborn trilogy**] (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.Mistborn) and kept going.. he's a fantastic writer and creates some truly great high fantasy. Excellently thought out magic systems, vivid worlds and characters, and twists that keep you on your toes. Another benefit to reading Sanderson is that he turns out material quicker than most, and his books aren't short on word count. Another sort of neat thing to consider is that almost all of his novels are subtly connected and he seems to be weaving a greater story behind the scenes.. 

He has also begun, what should prove to be, his longest and greater work yet.. The Stormlight Archive .. a series of 10 planned books. The first, The Way of Kings, is phenomenal (and clocks in at 1000 pages).. the 2nd is due out January 2014 ..  the waiting for this series is going to drive me mad."

"Eh, I wouldn't classify it as an adventure though... it's like 95% epic battle sequences."
"Mine are less technical:

The lean start up - framework for turning ideas into useful products

From zero to one - more start ups

Never split the difference - negotiating frameworks

Sapiens - why humans do what they do

Thinking Fast and Slow - decision making frameworks 

Brene brown - people managing frameworks

measure what matters - goal setting frameworks

Currently I'm reading AI super powers: China, silicone valley and the new world order. It's about Chinese tech entrepreneurship and deep learning. It is pretty good so far"
"Check out 'The Departed' came out in the mid 2000s I'd say 2006 or so. It's got Leonardo DiCaprio (One of his best performances in my opinion), Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg for the lead cast. It seems to fit the bill with what you're looking for it definitely has it's fair share of plot twists."
"So I go to eBay to check up on how much Smartwool socks are because my favourite undies are Bonds Hipster Trunks, which are $25 in store but about $8 each in bulk lots on eBay (maybe knockoffs, but they've cupped my scrote as well as the genuine article for the last year without looking like losing their stretchy sexiness).

Anyway, people are selling used socks on eBay. Used socks! Who the hell buys used socks? Goddamn people who want scrofulous fungal infections, that's who."
Definitely.  Was way ahead of it's time when it came out.
