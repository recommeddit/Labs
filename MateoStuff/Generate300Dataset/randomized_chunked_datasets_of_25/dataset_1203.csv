25405,best cricket teams of all time,Why pick a match fixer?
16854,best pet for toddlers,"Rabbits are interesting- Ive had them. Definitely not for everyone, especially small kids. Much like birds, they really only bond to one person and have a longer than anticipated life span (for most people) and many wind up dumped   or in shelters because people weren’t ready for the commitment."
29851,best money managing app,"Can not recommend this one enough. It is $5 a month but so worth it. It is your own personal excel spreadsheet with Mint capabilities. Best of both worlds, and they keep making it better."

11590,best gifts for dad,I imagined a statue of Goofy's ass.
5452,best home improvement store,"Lowes because of a myriad of reasons. They do military discounts everyday, they have an electronic record of everything you bought so that if you're not sure which type of light bulb you bought you can look it up. The Lowes that we go to is closer than Home Depot and is better organized."

30389,best Mexican war to study,"Buddy, if I ever become Caesar -- or even Alexander -- you are *so* getting a job in my imperial court as my official pick-me-up speechwriter. Consider it a promise.

And you have a point. Let the young upstarts conquer their central Asias and northeast Africas. Us old salts are much better off doing the real work, like dividing Gaul into three parts."

Loved Kangana after Queen but idk don't like her as a person but she's an amazing actor."
35842,best alcoholic drink,"Yep, there is something transcendental  about how the much-maligned, cheap, shitty lager, when drunk ice-cold in the shade on a blazing hot day, surrounded by pleasant company and goodwill, at that moment becomes the purest liquid to pass human lips; a veritable ambrosia. 

It always make me think of that scene in the Shawshank Redemption:

>And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49 wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Bohemia-style beer, courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison...The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous. We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. Hell, we could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses. We were the Lords of all Creation."
71742,best movies with a cool twist,"I can't even remember, there was a twist in the end? I do remember the twist where the murder happens. And it still shocked how early it came despite me realizing it was coming as soon as she went to the  shower."
