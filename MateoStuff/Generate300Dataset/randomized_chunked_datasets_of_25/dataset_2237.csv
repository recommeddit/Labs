30209,best Mexican war to study,I mean the war was kind of like if the Magas and Mexicans switched positions. The Americans moved and settled there for a long enough period that they felt like/claimed they were natives. Just how Mexicans were/are the dependents of Spaniards that lived in the americas for so long they felt like they were natives. I donâ€™t personally feel like either side was the good guys or bad guys.

37061,best roller coaster at six flags,"I have noticed that a few Six Flags parks do not do much in turns of landscaping. That is another thing Cedar Fair (and other parks like Bush Gardens) has.

The roller coasters had grass, rocks, etc. under them and were not just placed over concrete."
