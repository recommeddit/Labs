"This montage of tech/pc youtubers reacting to The Verges pc building tutorial. You dont need to know how to build a pc to laugh at this. 

For those who wont watch the video, a couple years ago, the verge released this video on how to build a pc. It is the best example of how NOT to build a PC. They've deleted their video now, since there was a lot of mockery.

"They sort of put themselves in that position. Half of the reason it supported iOS 9 was because the device was still sold in developing countries the year prior.  At the time they were proud of supporting their phones for at least two years from the shelf. Now because the processors are so much more powerful they don’t have a problem with that, but it played a large role in why it received the support"

I have yet to find a beach anywhere that wasn't upgraded by a Miami Vice. A float of 151 really starts my day out right too.
"New Level by Ferg is a great one, I'd also vouch for Westbrook by J.I.D. that Ferg also pops in on."
"Check out ""American Crime Story."" Both seasons are now on Netflix. The first one is about the trial of O.J. Simpson, and the second focuses on the murder of Gianni Versace.

""Luther"" is great too."
"Thanks, Pam."
"He has, but he uses class based components which I don't like so does the industry"
"Gotta see the show cause then you know the Vertigo is gonna grow, it gets so dangerous you'll have to sign a waiver."
"I think conferences are a better bet. Journals are not as prestigious in CS. Nonetheless, there's also a bunch of good stuff in journals."
"This is a gated community, please get the f*ck off the property."
"Colorado

Pikes Peak There's a road that takes you to the top of one of the most famous mountains in America. From there you can see amber waves of grain."
"Weeds was a creation of Jenji Kohan, who also created Orange is the New Black.   

I cannot recommend BoJack Horseman enough; it is outstanding.  

If you like stories about families, you may like Rectify."
A long time ago
"Most dominant player in their era? Don Hutson

Most complete/versatile player? Many would probably say Walter Payton, although I think Sammy Baugh was better who actually played in all 3 phases throughout his career.

Best athlete? Probably Randy Moss, but that doesn't mean it always translated on the field.

I'm going with Sammy Baugh. There was also the season where he led the league in passing, punting and interceptions in the same season."
"Hugo anything, I'm a big fan of the original"
"Tv series only: 

Berserk

Neon genisis evangelion 

FMA: brotherhood

Shiki

Toward the Terra

Attack on titan. 

Just off the top of my head."
"Are you using the streaming stick, or the Roku 3?

Thinking of getting her the streaming stick as a gift for her wall mounted, but I want the fastest option for HD tv!

thx!"
"This is so helpful, thank you. Which in the cheaper range would be adequate for mostly school work, but also some occasional light gaming? Looking for a budget friendly laptop that can be toted around in a backpack and run an occasional Steam game (not worried about having the best graphics). Thank you!"
However the abnormal high price tag makes it branded as a gaming piece immediately. People swearing about Razers products being overpriced so the UL2 is no excecption either.
How a viewer gonna solve the mystery in an episode of House?
Why would you want to rid yourself of the sweet sweet taste of Jamesons?
Last Crusade was cool too
