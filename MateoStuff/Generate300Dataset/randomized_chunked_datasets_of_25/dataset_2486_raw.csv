"It’s about perspective I guess. For me, living anywhere it gets 70+ for most of the day is unthinkable. I grew up in NYC and while it’s not known for being extremely hot in the summer, the humidity combined with 80+ temperatures killed me."
"""I wear it for myself because I catch a whif every now and then and I remember how good it smells, but knowing the opposite sex likes it helps.""

That's exactly how I feel. As for Aventus, I think any guy can pull it off. It's just that good."
Bob!!! I just finished the fourth book in that trilogy. It was great to check in with the Bobs again
"I just discovered the wonders of smoothies made with frozen bananas instead of ice. They come out tasting like milkshakes! So thick and creamy.

Healthy chocolate breakfast shake: 1 frozen banana, 1-2 tbs peanut butter, a few tbs cocoa powder and 1 cup of your choice of liquid."
So who do you guys think will rule the 2020s ?
I went through months of lectures without seeing a real-world example or practical application of what I was supposed to be studying. All theoretical stuff.
"Your game assay is incredible. I've always tried to envision cancer as an ecological process with many players, but this is something completely different ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0768-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0768-z)). Is it possible to predict every outcome based on the environment, initial drivers, and their propensity towards developing a heterogeneous population? I definitely need to read about this. If we can predict and treat the game, we can win. That's super powerful work - thank you so much! I'll share this article with the lab if you don't mind?"
"The Canadian theatre of the 7 years war was huge in establishing the English/French dynamic of the country that continues, to a degree, to this day."
*sooo* much better than sherwin williams dove white.
Yeah I'm not gonna do this
Exactly. He wanted to be lobotomized to the sake of relief
Wait... so its like an old fashion but with an extra ingredient and a lemon instead of orange?
"just bc Travis doesn't influence lyricists doesn't take his influence away. Now, personally I wouldn't really group his music in as ""hip hop"" in the traditional way, so I can see where you're coming from. I kinda see Trap as a different beast entirely, something that was once a subgenre but now it's just a genre of its own accord. To say Travis didn't influence hip hop, though, because he didn't influence lyricists is like saying The Sex Pistols didn't influence Rock bc they didn't influence pure musicality and talent on instruments. Sure, they didn't influence what the genre was built on, but they took that genre and built something completely new out of it. If that isn't influence idk what is"
But why would anyone ever want to be in Hollywood?
"I think readers make their local papers better with their support. You can always write to reporters and on occasion letters for publication, and put your voice out there. My current combination of this formula, just to share, are Newsday, The New York Times and National Geographic. I do subscribe to The New Yorker too, but I may read more than many, I think."
This would be top if enough people had seen it. Mind blowing twist.
"This right here. Class based components are terrible, and confusing."

"Back in the day, Canonical called Ubuntu ""Linux for human beings.""  


These days, Manjaro is, in terms of ease of installation, welcoming community and stability, and suitability for new users, the new Ubuntu. It allows the AUR for the rest of us."
"Oh no! Your response just broke the camels back for me to finally buy it. I’ve played FM on PC for years, but now that I’m taking on more responsibilities, i don’t have time to sit in front of my PC and play. If it’s similar, but on my IPad, and on the go? I’m sold! Time to scream in anger while on the toilet because I blew it again with The Cherries!"
"Like peanut butter? Well now you can like more of it. Sunflowers have been used to create a substitute for peanut butter, known as sunbutter."
"[There is the 15.6"" model](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7169&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-15z-ee000-8mf60av-1), which you can custom configuration for. However, it is out of stock currently."
"I love switching around instruments with my friends. Most everyone can play bass and drums, and a few of us know geetar and piano too. It makes for the most fun just switching around after every song. Keeps the vibes fresh and the brains sharp. Get the band back together dude! We want to hear you rock!!!"
It would be insane not to do it manually. What do you mean?
