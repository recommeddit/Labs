How many impressions do you show per month? I figure you have to be quite big to get amazon integrated
"I definitely agree with Black Orchid having a sultry, mysterious vibe. It’s such a unique scent. I’ve never smelled anything similar to it. Great choice!"
I played northgard on PC when it first came out. Replayed a lot on iOS. Very very good game.

I bought the LG-GL83a during Amazon sale as well. The only issue I have is that in the device manager it's recognized as GL850 version. Think I saw the same in the driver settings somewhere.
"Lots of running across a world that felt dead and I didn't enjoy the combat.

The robots were cool to look at though and the story was ok despite the robotic camerawork/animations during the cutscenes with dialogue options, shame that the dialogue options were completely pointless too."
Not sure why you are getting down voted. I’ve had the same experience. Cables very good quality. Quite thick compared to a lot of the cheapo ones.
"My favorite is a short article from Nature in 1985 by Harold Kroto that more or less won a Nobel Prize for him, and pissed off a slew of Exxon researchers who realized that they had observed these ""C60"" structures but just didn't know what they had a year before the article was published.... Gene Dresselhous has a great video about it. This was the first mention of the now ubiquitous Buckyball.

C922 is good
"Oh, don't get me wrong, sleeves and bags for laptops are good, but op asked about backpacks. I have a Crumpler sleeve (Which is great) and some other brand laptop bag (Which I found to be way to heavy). Anyway, I actually prefer backpacks. You see, I work night shifts mostly in area that is pretty much Prague's center of criminality and night life. Now I am a pretty big guy and there are easier targets out there, but I still feel a little more comfortable having a backpack that doesn't scream I have a expensive as fu.. laptop in it. + I usually have to fit either massive amounts of books for college or a lot of other stuff whenever I go anywhere.

That said, sleeves you linked look great. Will look into it when I need one."

So optimistic."
"Your point is actually one of the reasons why I believe he's over-rated. Sure his team was great, but his opponents weren't. He made a career from always being on a team that was vastly superior to his opposition, both internationally and domestically. Not that it's his fault that Brazil were so much better than those around them."

And if anyone gets THAT second reference, I worship you as my new god."

As a drummer I’d say that playing drums isn’t hard. Getting a basic beat and a few fills is pretty easy. Being a good drummer is very hard though.
I think you need some gummy tentacles in there as well.
"Wow, like, everyone???"
"Azuree, Aliage and Aromatics Elixir.  I like your style! 

I want to try Jardins de Bagatelle and Chant d'Aromes very much."
Unfortunately no it isn’t.
