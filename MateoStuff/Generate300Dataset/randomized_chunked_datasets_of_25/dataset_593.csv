I'd recommend looking at my [gaming laptop recommendation list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/).

30397,"Yes - the contrast could not be more stark.

The settlers were dependant on the Maori from the moment they arrived.
The Maori adapted very quickly.
By the time that tensions rose enough for a battle between the settlers and the Maori, the Maori had become veterans of modern warfare.
There was only one battle between settlers and Maori. The settlers came off very badly. So in the future, they had to use the Imperial Army.

From what I know, the descendants of the Aztecs lived under terribly oppressive conditions under their Empire. (Maybe they still do?)
Here, there were and are injustices. But they are nowhere near as great.

There is actually a fantastic documentary series.
The New Zealand Wars, based on and narrated by James Belich.

If you are lucky, somebody will have chopped it up into parts and put it on youtube. There is probably a torrent available too.",best Mexican war to study

The chef/owner used to work for the Lark.  They use simple, fresh ingredients to make unpretentious dishes that taste great. I would describe it as modern American.  The decor is great too with Santa Barbara-themed murals painted on the walls.

Get out of Philly and you have Valley Forge which is breathtakingly beautiful, not to mention historically important.  The rest of the state has everything---shopping, the Amish areas, rolling hills, swell diners, Pittsburgh which is lovely except for all those tunnels, Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Gettysburgh, the Johnstown Flood Museum was absolutely incredible.

73430,"I have an Anker 10,000 mAh (not sure which model). It's pretty old now, at LEAST 6 years, but it's quite light and a bit smaller than a deck of cards, I'm sure they're even better now. It'll charge a newer phone about 3x. Those cheap little chargers are usually about 1,000mAh and phones are around 3,000mAh so they're really not very good. You can get a 10k for like $25 and a 20k (six charges) for not much more, so it's worth the upgrade to one of those.

I'm a big fan of the Anker brand and so I'd definitely buy from them again.",best battery bank
