I'd recommend looking at my [gaming laptop recommendation list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/pfz9dq/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_september_2021/). I'd go with the Eluktronics Mech-15 G3 on that list. Ryzen 9 5900HX, RTX 3070 max 140W, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, and a 1440p 15.6"" 165Hz IPS display."

6698,best iPhone,I tried a demo 12 mini in the AT&T store today and it felt soooo cheap. Was it just because it was the demo version? What was your last phone? I am trying to upgrade from a 6s and am having a hard time deciding what to get.

7995,best laptop for general use,That's actually a different model. It has a weaker processor but a much nicer screen. I think that the Ryzen 7 model is still better though.
66490,best soccer team in the world,"need to be top 7, because Qatar will be the other first seed"
30397,best Mexican war to study,"Yes - the contrast could not be more stark.

The settlers were dependant on the Maori from the moment they arrived.
The Maori adapted very quickly.
By the time that tensions rose enough for a battle between the settlers and the Maori, the Maori had become veterans of modern warfare.
There was only one battle between settlers and Maori. The settlers came off very badly. So in the future, they had to use the Imperial Army.

From what I know, the descendants of the Aztecs lived under terribly oppressive conditions under their Empire. (Maybe they still do?)
Here, there were and are injustices. But they are nowhere near as great.

There is actually a fantastic documentary series.
The New Zealand Wars, based on and narrated by James Belich.

If you are lucky, somebody will have chopped it up into parts and put it on youtube. There is probably a torrent available too."
52925,best hiphop album,"Aquemini and Atliens

Because you can't make a list of essential hip hop albums without some OutKast"
33279,best electric car,Such as? I was looking at the base model and I don’t see anything specific that wasn’t included. What features were you referring to?
21292,best workout music,Blocked in my country? I'm an American dammit! You don't block an American! In the name of freedom I demand you play me that song!
71229,best movies with a cool twist,"Unbreakable

""In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero, and most of the time they're friends, like you and me."""
64907,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Middle Child (Cota/State) for everything.   


The chef/owner used to work for the Lark.  They use simple, fresh ingredients to make unpretentious dishes that taste great. I would describe it as modern American.  The decor is great too with Santa Barbara-themed murals painted on the walls. Good spot for when your out-of-town friends are visiting and you want to give them a sense of local scene but want to avoid more tourist-oriented restaurants."
47695,best state to visit in the United States,"I love Pennsylvania.  And thought the Liberty Bell story was amazing.  Philly is a great town for history, food, sports, art.  Get out of Philly and you have Valley Forge which is breathtakingly beautiful, not to mention historically important.  The rest of the state has everything---shopping, the Amish areas, rolling hills, swell diners, Pittsburgh which is lovely except for all those tunnels, Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Gettysburgh, the Johnstown Flood Museum was absolutely incredible.  
Lots of history packed into that state."
44849,best items under $100,"If you cook regularly, a large wooden chopping block and a decent quality chefs knife. Takes so much effort and time out of food prep in a way that transforms your will and ability to take on more complex recipes. So often I see people trying to prepare food with crappy little blunt knives on those tiny polythene chopping boards that slide around all over the place and I can barely watch."
59687,best perfume,"Byredo Mojave Ghost, Diptyque Philosykos, Serge Lutens Dent de Lait, Frederic Malle L'Eau d'Hiver"
52025,best iphone case,No way are those two ridges make it comfortable to hold the phone
73430,best battery bank,"I have an Anker 10,000 mAh (not sure which model). It's pretty old now, at LEAST 6 years, but it's quite light and a bit smaller than a deck of cards, I'm sure they're even better now. It'll charge a newer phone about 3x. Those cheap little chargers are usually about 1,000mAh and phones are around 3,000mAh so they're really not very good. You can get a 10k for like $25 and a 20k (six charges) for not much more, so it's worth the upgrade to one of those.

I'm a big fan of the Anker brand and so I'd definitely buy from them again."
35261,best alcoholic drink,Yes! I like gin and Seltzer water with a lime!
19481,best YouTube video,There's a tax for that.
53475,best usb c charging cable,Great advice! This is really important
39639,best podcast for biologists,"* Story Collider - Personal stories from scientists or people affected by science. (Think *The Moth* but for science/health) 
* Science Vs - Examines the science of new trends or conflicts (Paleo Diet, genetics of Homosexuality, E- Cigs) First season was on ABC but the next season should be coming out of Gimlet Media soon. 
* Flash Forward - Imagines a future with some new technology or innovation and explores the implications/likelihood with current experts and fiction
* Radiolab - Some of the science journalism out there. This American Life meets science. Not always biology but often so with usually a big dose of ethics. 
* Transistor - solid science journalism podcast that often has interesting biology stories (last one I remember was history of birth control) 
* White Coat, Black Art - Current topics in healthcare from a Canadian EM doc"
36162,best alcoholic drink,"Kind of off topic, but as a bar newbie, where the fuck can i learn a list of common drinks to order?  All these exotic ones are nice, but I just want some classics to get me started, haha."
