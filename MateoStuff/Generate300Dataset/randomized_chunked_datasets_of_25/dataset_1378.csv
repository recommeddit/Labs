45754,"It's not weird! Handing out candy is one of my favorite things to do, and I don't have any kids. I love seeing little kids in costumes being all adorable.

I've lived in my house a little over a year now, and last year I got my candy ready and got all excited and turned on my porch light and sat and waited and not a single kid came. I live on kind of a weird side street separate from the rest of the neighborhood, but I know there are a bunch of kids around. 

This year, I still bought candy, and I'm going to put a costume on my dog and turn on my porch light and hope for the best in the cold rain we're supposed to get. I see the same kids every day when I'm walking the dog; part of me wanted to tell them all where I live so they'll come get candy from me, but I also don't want to get arrested so I did not follow through.

72098,"Indeed.

**Village spoilers to follow:** I mean regardless of whether you feel it works or not, it's definitely related. The Village is about the way we cope with evil and pain. The society presented to us has decided to run from it, to hide, to pretend it doesn't exist. Misguided but well-meaning, they use fear as a tool to protect their families from the difficulties they endured. Of course they eventually find that evil can still infiltrate their primitive paradise from within.",best movies with a cool twist
