36584,"It depends what I'm doing really. I have favorite bars with favorite drinks. And certain situations (to me) dictate certain types of drinks. It's all about the pairing. 

There's a local bar in town with 92 tequilas available, best place to drink margaritas on the patio on a warm summer night. 

Another local bar has what they call pre-prohibition libations, interesting cocktails you don't see many places. Also, Pisco, which makes a great capirinha. 

Another local bar is an awesome whiskey bar, they make great summer drinks. 

Then there's the Irish pub, where a Guinness, a Jameson, and fish & chips is a must. 

Warm summer day at home, an ice cold wheat beer. 

Cold winter night, a thick stout or porter. 

Making a fine steak, a glass of quality scotch (glenlivit or balvenie). 

Sometimes, I just get in the mood for an islay scotch. Laphoraig and lagavulin are in the cabinet. 

I swear I'm not an alcoholic.

28883,"Put butter in skillet.  Melt butter.  Keep adding butter here and there throughout the cooking process.  Put in baked potatoes with the skin off that you've cooked in micro or oven (micro cooked tastes better for this).  Use fork and kinda cube up the potatoes to your liking. Fry up potatoes.  When you start seeing your potatoes turning golden brown, add eggs and whatever seasoning you prefer (applewood is delicious!)  When eggs are fully cooked and potatoes are golden brown then it's ready to eat.  I call this egg and potato.  You can also add bacon if you like it, or substitute hash browns for the baked potatoes.

I also make a version like this without the egg and just add cubed chicken.  I call it chicken and potato.",best breakfast foods
