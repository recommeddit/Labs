72300,best adblocker extension,Yeah that’s prob true. I just want to imagine some dude who made a bunch of money making bricks or something super not tech related but he just HATES ads on the internet so he’s taken this up as his cause. Modern day Robbin Hood or what have you.

73819,best matte screen protector for ipad,You should try getting a magnetic screen protector. Put it on when you’re doing notes and take it off when you want to enjoy the mini led screen. So it’s a win win situation

36584,best alcoholic drink,"It depends what I'm doing really. I have favorite bars with favorite drinks. And certain situations (to me) dictate certain types of drinks. It's all about the pairing. 

There's a local bar in town with 92 tequilas available, best place to drink margaritas on the patio on a warm summer night. 

Another local bar has what they call pre-prohibition libations, interesting cocktails you don't see many places. Also, Pisco, which makes a great capirinha. 

Another local bar is an awesome whiskey bar, they make great summer drinks. 

Then there's the Irish pub, where a Guinness, a Jameson, and fish & chips is a must. 

Warm summer day at home, an ice cold wheat beer. 

Cold winter night, a thick stout or porter. 

Making a fine steak, a glass of quality scotch (glenlivit or balvenie). 

Sometimes, I just get in the mood for an islay scotch. Laphoraig and lagavulin are in the cabinet. 

I swear I'm not an alcoholic.

35770,best alcoholic drink,It's so damn hard to sit in that pocket of recollection. It always sucks to wake up and remember having a great time but not be able to remember why.
17647,best iOS game,"Black Desert, Ark, and Sky are amazing on iPad mini at least."
40170,best midrange CPU,"Yes, but not by much and title specific. An intel cpu may be 5-10% faster but cost 150-200+ dollars more. You can put that towards a better GPU.

It all depends on your budget. If money is no concern, just go intel. If it is, you cant best a 2600+ a higher tier of vid card for same price."
37286,best amusement park,"And it is close to Disney, which is probably why it is searched in those states."
67995,best science fiction novel,"The bad writing  bits seemed to be part of the unreliable narrative in John Dies at the End; it enhanced the experience. Spiders was better done, but more formulaic.

And you never kill the dog. I've seen John Wick, don't kill the dog!"

28883,best breakfast foods,"Put butter in skillet.  Melt butter.  Keep adding butter here and there throughout the cooking process.  Put in baked potatoes with the skin off that you've cooked in micro or oven (micro cooked tastes better for this).  Use fork and kinda cube up the potatoes to your liking. Fry up potatoes.  When you start seeing your potatoes turning golden brown, add eggs and whatever seasoning you prefer (applewood is delicious!)  When eggs are fully cooked and potatoes are golden brown then it's ready to eat.  I call this egg and potato.  You can also add bacon if you like it, or substitute hash browns for the baked potatoes.

I also make a version like this without the egg and just add cubed chicken.  I call it chicken and potato."
68614,best science fiction novel,"I am lucky enough to be able to read Lem in his native language so I have read a lot of his books. I would put several more of his on the above list, but I am not sure if they've been translated into English or the quality of the translations."
