37424,best amusement park,"Loved that park. 

Me, wife, son and daughter, 10 and 9 years old then, While standing in the tunnel at the glass looking into the Hippo enclosure, a huge hippo floated up with its ass against the glass and let its bowels lose. It was shooting onto the glass for ever. Like 3 bales of green hay being shot at you. Good memories."

67310,axios alternatives reddit,"Just because something is used doesn't mean it's thriving. 

How are you equating that ""being used"" is the same as being alive? At my last job we used Zend framework 1.x despite the last update being in like 2012. Just because it's functioning doesn't make Zend 1.x alive and well haha. 

Nobody is saying that being dead makes the tool suddenly unusable. It just means ***as a project***, Axios appears to be dead/dying. I have to imagine a lot of people use it because they're like me. They had no idea there were so many concerning issues with the project. I had no idea until I saw this post."

9647,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I feel like this is the minority opinion regarding San cat... Portola is alright. Nothing fantastic, nothing terrible. Just lower your expectations and you'll be fine. And from what I've heard it can get pretty loud at night from construction as well as noisy neighbors. And for the bike ride, some of my friends hate it, some don't mind. Regardless it is a major inconvenience forcing either to rely on the bus system or to bike some ways away to get on campus. It makes anything other than class harder to attend because you wonder if it's worth the bike ride/hassle. Though Just my thoughts mixed in with what I've heard. I personally live in Santa Cruz and it's pretty awesome that we're in walking distance to the beach."
