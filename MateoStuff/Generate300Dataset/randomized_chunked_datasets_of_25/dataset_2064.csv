54234,"It'll depend on how your symptoms manifest. I have terrible sinuses, so I get crazy congestion and I rely on Maximum Strength Mucinex-D. That shit is like magic but it's insanely strong so they only let you buy it every 6 weeks or so (at least in my state). Honestly, I've found that staying away from ""all in one"" medications and instead targeting my specific symptoms is what works best for me. I'll usually end up taking a pain reliever and a decongestant. Just be sure that if you're mixing medications, you keep an eye on the acetaminophen content, since it is possible to overdose if you overdo it.

If you're up for it, neti pot nasal rinses are amazing and disgusting all at once. You basically shoot water up your nose into your sinuses and drain everything that's up there. It's weird at first and sounds really hippy-dippy but will seriously make you feel amazing. Also be sure that you're staying hydrated! I usually go with hot water with a little bit of honey, lemon, and ginger when I'm sick.",best medicine for a cold

&#x200B;

Rymdkapsle is an oldy but a goody.  You build a spaceship using sideways tetris blocks while little square men run around and defend it.  The music is very Eno-eque and lovely.  It was one of the first iOS games I bought and I've never not had it on my device.

&#x200B;

Retro Bowl is leaps and bounds beyond any other American football game on mobile.  It's tecmo bowl with an Angry Birds like mechanic for passing the ball.  It's a real gem and endlessly fun to play.

&#x200B;

GameDev Tycoon is my favorite of the dev/shop kinds of games.

&#x200B;

Polytopia is the leanest, meanest, cutest 4X game on mobile.  Civ Rev is a solid alternative to this as well.

&#x200B;

Human Resource Machine is an awesome ""learn to code"" game with great art style.

&#x200B;

Kingdom: New Lands might be my favorite mobile game of all time.  I've purchased it so many times I've lost count.  It's a really unique pixel art side scroller.  You are a king/queen with a horse who rides back and forth collecting coins and ordering buildings and defenses built.  At night the monsters come.  It has a sequel with added elements and co-op but I haven't spent as much time with that one.",best iOS game

Guy bought 6 large popcorns and a bunch of smart waters when I thought, “man this guy is loaded”. He was wearing a hoodie and glasses so I couldn’t quite tell at first. I eventually said, “Hey you kinda look like this guy Nathan Fillion”

He took off his glasses and said, “I sure hope so.”

I'll ask around on MobileRead, but I have a feeling that I can't be the first person with an Android eReader lol, and that it'll be a WONTFIX issue, kinda like the black box organisation of books.


**Rant:**

Can't understand how Calibre's black box folder tree requirement thing hasn't been loosened. Posts I've seen typically say ""Oh, but tags are better. Deal with it."" Windows Media Player prefers ```Artist/Album/01 Song.mp3``` organisation, similar to Calibre's ```Author/BookTitleButCutOff organisation/filename.bookformat```. WMP, however, doesn't care if you do some custom folders, as it looks for the song metadata (album, artist, etc.) in the ID3 tags built into the MP3 file. Calibre stores metadata in those OPF files, because most ebook formats don't support additional metadata like ID3; don't know why it can't just look for ```filename.opf```, ```filename.jpg``` (book cover) and assume the existence of ```filename.bookformat``` next to it, and save the file location to the main metadata database. That way, you get the best of both worlds - you can organise your books as you wish in folders, and keep the metadata, etc. functions of Calibre",best place to pirate audiobooks reddit
51093,"I thought I'd post this to spark some discussion, but I really don't think it's worthy of much praise. This is a generic-ass list. You've got all the ""help-me-seem-credible"" standards in there (Trout Mask, Pet Sounds, etc.), plus some token albums from a few of the ""other genres"" (jazz, hip hop, etc.), and then they do an intentionally controversial top 10 (to get clicks and sell some magazines), and the rest is a mix of what they actually listen to in their iTunes library: forgettable flash-in-the-pan stuff from the last 5 years that will be forgotten in another 5 years.",best rap album

37624,"Interesting! Rankings are so subjective but it's always fun to see what other people choose.

I think Civil War is WAY too high, as is Guardians 2. Far From Home is way better than Homecoming; and Age of Ultron disappointed me at first but it grew on me upon repeat viewings, so I don't think it deserves to be quite so low. And Infinity War is too low, obviously.

This post inspired me to make my own list, which made me think really hard about which ones I want to re-watch, so now I know what I'm doing with my upcoming day off!

I came up with a ranking, but the actual rankings are less important than the categories I made:

1. Absolute Favorites: Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok
2. I love these movies: Avengers, Far From Home, The First Avenger, Endgame, Infinity War, Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain Marvel
3. I like these movies: Iron Man 2, Thor, Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, Homecoming
4. I do not like these movies (will probably not re-watch): Guardians 2, Civil War, The Dark World, Doctor Strange, Incredible Hulk",best Marvel movie
