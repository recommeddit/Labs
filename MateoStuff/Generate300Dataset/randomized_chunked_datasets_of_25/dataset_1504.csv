Perfect mindfuck film"
7109,best iPhone,"If only the macbooks were priced more reasonably I wouldâ€™ve had a full apple lineup right now, but the base 13 inch without discrete graphics (which i need) was 600 euros more expensive than the huawei matebook 13 I ended up getting. For that extra 600 I got myself an awesome pair of Bose QC 35 headphones and a trip to italy."

55077,best places to hike in the east coast,I didn't mean ignore it in the sense that we pretend it doesn't exist. I mean in the sense that it isn't up north.
15151,best tree for the garden,"Could work! Is there a limit on how high trellis can be set up? The fence is 6ft high. Suppose I wanted the trellis 3-4ft higher than that, could neighbours complain?"
68089,best science fiction novel,"I really dig *Ophiuchi Hotline*, but I feel Varley's short story collection *The Persistence of Vision* outperforms this novel."
64894,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"You'll be happy to hear it hasn't changed a bit since you left. Chicken Ranch is a staple if you've lived here more than 10 years. Quality is the same it's always been, and the salsa is unbeatable.

I can see why people think it's boring. Makes me think about how Paradise Cafe was just sold and they immediately changed up the Paradise Burger -- wtf guys, why would you fuck with the staple of the entire restaurant? Now I have no reason to go there."
54797,best water filter,I use a Doulton filter
57268,best water brand,"Hard water tends to be pretty varied in which minerals it contains, but is pretty much always better than soft water. This is because compounds like magnesium are ""sticky"", and are better at extracting flavours from your beans. However if your hard water contains too much bicarbonate the result can be bitter.

&#x200B;

You'll get a much stronger flavor from the same beans if you use high-magnesium ""hard water"" in place of distilled or softened water. If in doubt what water to use contact the roaster of the coffee you use and ask them what water they test with. Most will use mains water, so that's normally a safe bet, but otherwise just get a water filter jug that adds magnesium and you're good to go!

&#x200B;

On that note, **this makes most bottled water BAD**. Bottled water is naturally soft, thanks to low levels of calcium and magnesium. Unfortunately for your coffee this means they're not well positioned to extract well.

This isn't pseudo science either. Chris Hendon, an MIT chemist, teamed up with with baristas Lesley and Maxcell Colonna-Dashwood (who [won](http://sprudge.com/maxwell-colonna-dashwood-wins-2015-united-kingdom-barista-championship-72361.html) the 2015 UK Barista Championship) to specifically test what kind of water to use in coffee. Hendon handled computer analysis whilst the baristas tested the premise in the real world making coffee. They ended up publishing their research in the [Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf501687c)

This team-up went on to come 5th in the [World Barista Championship](http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/). So it's probably safe to assume they know what they're talking about."

I'd had a few coffee machines in the past and not only were they a pain to clean, I had two break in the space of a month.

Decided to take a punt on the Aeropress. Literally use it every single morning and all it needs is a quick rinse under the tap when I'm finished and leave to dry.

What a bargain"
