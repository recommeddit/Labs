57268,"Hard water tends to be pretty varied in which minerals it contains, but is pretty much always better than soft water. This is because compounds like magnesium are ""sticky"", and are better at extracting flavours from your beans. However if your hard water contains too much bicarbonate the result can be bitter.

&#x200B;

You'll get a much stronger flavor from the same beans if you use high-magnesium ""hard water"" in place of distilled or softened water. If in doubt what water to use contact the roaster of the coffee you use and ask them what water they test with. Most will use mains water, so that's normally a safe bet, but otherwise just get a water filter jug that adds magnesium and you're good to go!

&#x200B;

On that note, **this makes most bottled water BAD**. Bottled water is naturally soft, thanks to low levels of calcium and magnesium. Unfortunately for your coffee this means they're not well positioned to extract well.

This isn't pseudo science either. Chris Hendon, an MIT chemist, teamed up with with baristas Lesley and Maxcell Colonna-Dashwood (who [won](http://sprudge.com/maxwell-colonna-dashwood-wins-2015-united-kingdom-barista-championship-72361.html) the 2015 UK Barista Championship) to specifically test what kind of water to use in coffee. Hendon handled computer analysis whilst the baristas tested the premise in the real world making coffee. They ended up publishing their research in the [Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf501687c)

This team-up went on to come 5th in the [World Barista Championship](http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/). So it's probably safe to assume they know what they're talking about.",best water brand
