He was absolutely lovely though, my bf loves bikes so he was over the moon bless him.

14965,"[Alyssa Cole](https://alyssacole.com/) has some really good books both historical and contemporary. Her protagonists tend to be women of color and her historicals aren't all set in England (which tends to happen in romances). 

I'm also going to second [Smart Bitches Trashy Books](www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com) as a resource for finding well written reviews of romance novels and their daily sales posts are really nice. 

For contemporaries I also like Shannon Stacey, Linda Howard, Julie James, and Nora Roberts (has a huge back catalog with some paranormals in there). For more erotic writing I've enjoyed the Beyond series from Kit Rocha but it's pretty BDSM heavy.",best romantic novel
