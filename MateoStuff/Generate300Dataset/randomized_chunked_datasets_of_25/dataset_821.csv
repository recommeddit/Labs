36479,best alcoholic drink,"Well yes, there's good and bad of everything. But I could make a gallon of mead for $10 (give or take, depending on ingredients). Good commercial meads start at $25 - $30 for a 750 ml bottle. So even with an occasional bad batch it comes out ahead."

He was absolutely lovely though, my bf loves bikes so he was over the moon bless him.

He had to restrain himself a little from roasting the GS as they are notorious for their unreliability"

14965,best romantic novel,"[Alyssa Cole](https://alyssacole.com/) has some really good books both historical and contemporary. Her protagonists tend to be women of color and her historicals aren't all set in England (which tends to happen in romances). 

I'm also going to second [Smart Bitches Trashy Books](www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com) as a resource for finding well written reviews of romance novels and their daily sales posts are really nice. 

For contemporaries I also like Shannon Stacey, Linda Howard, Julie James, and Nora Roberts (has a huge back catalog with some paranormals in there). For more erotic writing I've enjoyed the Beyond series from Kit Rocha but it's pretty BDSM heavy."

10568,best suitcase lock,"As always the real LPTs are either in the comments or in the /r/undelete/ sub. The TSA can, will, and is mandated to open your bags and check them. If you put a padlock on your bag they will either open the zipper as descibed above or they will straight up cut the lock or even cut open the bag itself if needed.

Do not put anything you would be exceptionally upset to lose in checked baggage. This includes valuables, electronics, medicines, gifts, etc... Ship it via UPS or USPS, and insure it if it's exceptionally valuable."
