"That's what we call a vicious Halloween feedback loop. They're preachy and uncharitable because they get egged, and kids egg them for being preachy and uncharitable."
"the kirkland ones were pretty good in terms of quality,

you really think the $80 raybans are really $60 better than those?

but yea it really gets ridiculous past $100"
"By far Sublime. It's quick, simple and elegant. The other Electron based text editors (VS Code, atom.io, etc.) may be flashy and feature packed but the start time for them is horrible if you just want to quickly edit a simple text file. Not to mention the monstrous amount of RAM that they have to use."

"This list is compiled from the ratings of members of the [Redditors Guild](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1290) on Board Game Geek using an algorithm that is broadly similar to the one used to compile the BGG scores. 

If you want to have your ratings reflected in this list, sign up for BGG and join the guild - that's it!

Also I made a decision to only compile these once a quarter. The list just doesn't change enough from month to month to be worthwhile. So this reflects change to the list since the beginning of the year and you can look for the next one on or about July 1st!"
"Crested gecko! 

They don't smell bad

They are easy to tame

They rarely bite, and when they do, it doesn't hurt in my experience

They don't require special lighting or heat

Their diet is mainly a fruit powder mix

If you get one, I recommend getting from a breeder / at a reptile show. 

Let me know if you want more information

"The cost per core is pretty close, the 3300x should drop a little in price when there is more competition.  Literally every PC store is trying to sell 3600s so you get the best price."
"When I was in my 20's, my friend told me that a woman should have a signature scent. I liked that idea and chose Dune, by Christian Dior. At age 63, I still wear it. I still love it, I get lots of compliments.  

I'll have to tell my kids to have the undertaker spritz it on me at my viewing. My friends will know it's me."
I buy them in Canada at the Banana Republic Factory Outlet. About $28 canadian dollars for the large bottle.
"Yes I would definitely go back. The furthest north of the resorts so highly private, great excursions/activities, and the food is solid. I’m a highly picky eater and enjoyed the food. 

Great fishing, private island to excursion to, excellent scuba/snorkeling, and nice gym etc."
It’s great on Mobile. The phone app is close in functionality to the web app. The iPad version is almost indistinguishable

"Isn't this perhaps why he is so respected? He actually did his fucking job! What a concept ! 

A government official, a public servant, to me has the sole duty of being a sort of supreme administrator. They rarely take this role anymore at all so I am guessing any examples offered in this thread will likely be at least 100 years ago. 

Funny that such a huge guy in global history (Washington) and I know so little about him. Definitely need to bone up on this stuff. As a sun monkey here in the southern hemisphere , I am probably no more knowledgeable than the hicks I constantly ridicule."
The Hobbit and The Odyssey are my favorites for sure. I also started Journey to the West a few days ago and it's also quite amazing
"Just wanted to throw in that the validity of these indicators is highly debated. From an epistemological, pedagogical and sociology-of-science point of view, there probably shouldn't be list of ""Top 1000"" universites as such a compilation loses a lot of meaning through oversimplification.


EDIT: There seems to be a bit of misunderstanding going on. What I meant was that filtering for certain criteria like ""best ranked in *teaching* medicine or in chemistry *research*"" should make the ranking a bit more meaningful. HOWEVER: I just tested the 2018 results for ""history, philosophy, theology"", disciplines where continental European universities are traditionally quite strong in research output as well as in teaching. Funnily they are being overtaken by many tech-focused institutions (some of which already have a lower quantitative output of publications when compared to the larger European unis). Just look for yourself at wich rank finally the first European uni appears: https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/100/subjects/3102/sort_by/scores_research/sort_order/asc/cols/scores

One reason for this might be that these rankings exclude German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch.. publications right from the start. 

TL;DR: my confidence in these results has dropped another couple of notches."

Its really rare to get a good deal like that here. Tried for a long time to get a good condition Nintendo New 2DS XL for cheap but never found one.
