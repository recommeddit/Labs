41054,best instrument to play,"As a bass player, honestly I think that bass, specifically electric bass, is the easiest instrument to learn to play. You only have to worry about playing one note at a time, and you have frets to keep your notes in tune (assuming you're instrument is set up properly, and you've tuned it). 

Bass rhythms vary widely, but if you have a competent drummer, it's easy enough to follow the bass drum, or a paired down version of the bass drum rhythm. I'm speaking about modern contemporary and pop music of course. 

Mostly the rhythms are 1 to 3 notes per measure, making the rhythms very easy, along with the fretting of the notes really. But, everyone is different in their own learning styles. 

Some people may think the keys of a trumpet are easier, but to me there are more movements involved in a brass, or woodwind, instrument than in a string instrument. With wind instruments you have to shape your mouth as well as play the right keys to get the proper notes. With stringed instruments, especially ones where the strings are plucked (bass, guitar, etc.) you only need to remember where the notes are played, not the shape of your mouth, despite what guitarists look like when they're crushing a solo ðŸ˜‰

TL;DR: bass guitar is easiest, imo."

37694,best Marvel movie,"The film had some good comedy scenes, with back-and-forth between Thor and Loki, even Jane had a good moment or two in that regard. It was visually beautiful, and the main (musical) theme is brilliant.

Plot-wise, though... well. It's an important installment because of an Infinity Stone, but nothing I would like to watch again."
