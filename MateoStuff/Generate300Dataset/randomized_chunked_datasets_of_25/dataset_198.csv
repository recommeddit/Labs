22556,best celebrity,"I used to be a bellboy so I saw tons of celebs act like complete dicks or really nice people. I once saw William Shatner charge a kid 100$ for an autograph because he was asking outside of the fan expo he was attending and then I heard rumor he was charging $100 inside anyways. Brian Adams treated me like a total pack mule just because he could and had me move 40 pieces of press junket boxes back and forth for a laugh. Terry Crews asked me for a book of matches and tipped me $20 and when I went to explain that it was too much he said he knew what he was giving, laughed and walked away. Gene Simmons had me hold a limo driver for 5 hours (losing other fares during a film festival) and then proceeded to jump in a cab at the door because the limo wouldn't take a horrendously low flat rate essentially fucking myself and the limo for peak tip/fare time. I could go on if you girls/guys are interested."

13883,best research paper archive,"To me, nothing compares with the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen paper on the nature of physical reality and quantum mechanics. It's beautiful for the simplicity of its argument, and it is basically the spawning point for all subsequent work in quantum foundations. It can be found here:

Staying with Einstein, his book on special relativity is extremely intuitive and understandable to anyone, and is definitely worth a read."

3591,best college for research,The libraries comment is a good point. Thanks. I've heard that an R1 school may do multiple 100's of millions of dollars in research where an R2 may do 100 million or less in research.
34149,best NFL player,"He wasn't really a deep threat as he wasn't very fast. He was a homerun threat because of his YAC ability no doubt.

>I could go on, but I think the fact that he scored 22 touchdowns in a 12 game season, in an era where the defense was still allowed to stop the pass is more convincing than anything else.

In a strike season where 80% of players didn't cross the picket lines; he didn't go against the same caliber of defenses."

55130,best places to hike in the east coast,"That sounds like something interesting a few people would like to read. As someone who visits ADK a few times a year and have gotten to know a few locals, I'd love to read about it. Especially how hiking and climbing kind have affected ADK and if they affect the environment/economy differently from ski folks or non-outdoorsy tourists, if you cover different demographics. 


Please consider posting your thesis to relevant subs when you are done!"
