Didn't it yellow after a while?  Almost every review of a clear case that isn't a rigid case talks about it yellowing or browning after a couple months.

"I like both hard science fiction, provocative sci-fi and some of the great classics, so here's my list: **Dune**, **1984**, **Neuromancer**, **Ender's Game**, **The Time Machine**, **Fahrenheit 451**, **Stranger in a Strange Land**, **Snow Crash**, **Slaughterhouse 5** and **A Wrinkle in Time**. I'd add **Frankenstein** due to its profound brilliance and depth, but is it science fiction?

Here's a second list too; non-English language sci-fi that's also excellent: **20,000 Leagues Under the Sea**, **All You Need is Kill**, **The Three-Body Problem**, **Battle Royale**, **The Windup Girl** and **Solaris**."
"Recently found 'Der Pass' on nowtv / sky atlantic and it's fantastic. the rest have been mentioned... both seasons of the sinner, mindhunter (2nd season out tomorrow), the killing, manhunt: unabomber, enjoy."
Who cares about hip hop just listen to nier's ost.
Oh thanks for your genuine concern. I have a few lifelong friends but in different countries.
Hardly worth $1.50 to figure that out though.  At least for me.
"Rse Hoenn was my absolute favorite. It felt like a true game. It was a lot of fun. Loved the Pokémon and it was my favorite map. I loved the desert, the ash area and the sea routes. I miss having complex sea routes to explore. Exploring the ocean floor was so cool. Contests and secret bases were also a lot of fun. Also think it had the best overall story, best puzzles and best set of legendaries. 


I think SwSh were the worst. Played more like a simulator than a game. More expensive plus dlc that should already been in the game. zero story for the first 95% of the game. Climax was a flop. No interesting routes to navigate. They were all really linear. Legendaries were lame. Hated the rival. They cut a lot of my favorites"
I think it makes it even worse knowing Australia only misses this list by one place. At least if we’d been further off I wouldn’t have gotten my hopes up.
There's just something about that instrument when an orchestra is playing and then they have a solo part.
"The Negroni.
Equal parts gin, campari, and sweet vermouth chilled and served up with an orange rind."

duh it's biology. it's like the art major of the science world.
The lack of infinity war and guardians 2 instead of Endgame and maybe Strange is kinda disturbing.
"Been planning on reading the book for like the last 2 years, but yes I meant the movie, I'm sure the book goes much deeper than the film ever could though."
They did slow phones without notifying the user. It’s just unprovable that the motive was to sell more phones.
"I love my TI-84 Plus CE. I also own a regular TI-84 Plus, and I'd gladly take the CE over it, even though it costs marginally more. It doesn't cost much more, but it's significantly slimmer, easier to read, and is rechargeable with a battery indicator so I never have to worry about it dying during an important exam.

However, the Nspire is certainly the more powerful calculator, and it's about the same cost."
"Ologies is amazing! It’s all science, but there’s a lot of biology. I have a PhD in biology and I still learn a lot."
"I got one! Although I have never been in an accident before *knock on wood*, the peace of mind that it gives me to know that I have backup evidence or anything of that sort for future issues is calming. Best 50 bucks spent in the last 30 days."
Bring a little sack of coffee to clear the nose pallette. You sniff the coffee in-between scents and you don't get headaches after.
I’m from the Midwest and know about it only because my dad is a history buff. I don’t think we ever learned about it in school
Anything off Evil Empire for that matter.
