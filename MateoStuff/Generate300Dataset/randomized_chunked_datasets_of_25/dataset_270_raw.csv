"I met John Candy on a plane when I was a little kid while traveling with my family.  He was a *big* man. He had the whole row to himself in front of us with the armrest up between seats so he could be more comfortable.   The stewardesses were blocking anyone from coming up and bothering him, even though they themselves were not exactly leaving him alone what with  talking to him constantly and laughing at his enjoyable banter the whole trip.

At some point he got up to go to the bathroom. When he came back he looked at me, pretended to do a double-take like he was surprised and said , ""hey, you're the quietest kid ever, don't you talk?""  The way he said it was so friendly that I just smiled and giggled. Then he had a pleasant conversation with my parents, who had been DYING to talk to him the entire flight, but were too polite to bother him.

Not even 2 weeks later we heard he had passed."
"+1 for the Culture stuff, though yes the better ones IMHO were pre-2k"

"Europe is the herpes of history - it's just going to flare up again, even if it doesn't seem like it now."
Same here PM me and I can send some games too
All the students want to do game dev.  All the pros want to stay the hell away from it.
The week in review is amazing. I wish I could write the way Frank Rich writes.
8 plus and still using it.
"Germany is hit or miss, t-mobile is great in some areas, but crap in others. Sane with Vodafone, tks, etc. It's really based on which village you live in."
"I make a hot totty. Half a mug of whiskey or brandy, juice from half a lemon, 3-5 cloves, spoon of honey and fill the rest of the mug with hot water. Drink it as fast as you can and go to bed. You'll sweat like never before and feel better the next day."
WHAT
Excession.
"Redline. The only energy drink you have to be 18 or older to purchase. It has a series of warning labels. Youre only supposed to drink half to bottle the first time you drink it to assess tolerance and it doubles as a work out supplement that burns fat when you train. 

It's the only thing that kicks you in the fucking face when you need it to."

"Just piggy-backing off this. B.S. in Psych, worked retail for 3 years, then went back for my masters in Fall 2015. I got an assistantship which paid for 75% of my tuition and gave me a $200 a week stipend. I worked in the disability services office 20 hours a week and taught a section of the ""Welcome to College"" class to freshmen. Now I work full time in a disability services office at a different school and I adjunct teach for fun. Literally my assistantship is why I'm employable and I'm not even in that much debt from a 2 year grad program!"
"Ok, thanks!"
"Yes, Especially when you take all other sports into account. Tennis (Djokovic and others), Basketball (5x World champs, a dozen Euro champs), Watepolo (world and Olympic champs for decades), Volleyball same thing. And more."
"It’s a gift for my wife who is an artist.  She sketches on a drawing pad sitting down, but will also sketch on a canvas. We are on a budget so she doesn’t want to buy herself a nice set, but a gift she can’t argue with."
glass is so loud with any variation of the pencil. matte is still clicky but not as much. it feels more natural too. my only real problem with the matte is that it gets gunky really quick if i dont keep my hands super clean when im using my fingers like normal
"I don’t know how their traditional pepperoni is, but my favorite pizza of all time is the New York City Pizza from Cataldo’s. It’s a pesto sauce, with sun dried tomatoes, sausage slices, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and red onion. It is so good."
"Obviously Australia,they literally dominated the 2000s and the 1930s
