"You could go for the amazon fire tv stick. I bought one when they were announced and I love it so far. Comes with a remote control so you don't have to rely on your phone to cast content like you do with the chromecast. Has amazon prime, Netflix, hulu, pandora, and plex, plus lots of other stuff that I never use."
Genshin Impact and Arknights
"Domestically maybe. International, hell no. Try sending a bag across the Atlantic, all of a sudden business class becomes the more economical option."
"thanks to kanye's new workout plan, i was able to date outside the family, i bought a double wide and i rode a plane

"I only play this way now. When you're building towards an engine, non-drafting makes it super difficult. Just feels better when you do it as you're more likely to get relevant cards of course. For anyone who hasn't tried it this way - you won't regret it but it adds a slightly increase in time"
Isnt google sheets the online version of excel? I thought they were identical
"I’m currently loving Zebra and I use it as my main package manager now , unless there is an issue then I’ll go and use Sileo but overall best one so far!!"
My only problem with El Bajio is their price point. I took a group of co-workers there and was shocked at the $13 Tortas. That’s ridiculous!
"As far as satisfying your gf, you could do a stopover in NYC on your way to some place else.  NYC has great sites, shopping, clubbing, food, Broadway, etc.  The NFL has preseason games in August, I think.  Check out the Jets and Giants. 

Don't forget to check out hostels... they do exist in the USA.  I suggest private rooms if available.

The US is huge, so depending on how much time you have pick out a few places to visit.  If you're into museums, history, and politics DC is cool to visit too."
"The first time I ever even heard the term GOAT in reference to the greatest of all time was around 2011-12 and was about Jerry Rice. Seems like even over just the past decade, his legacy has become underrated."
Isn't it the instrument they played the opening theme to Harry Potter on? I like that song. It's very... neat.
Yo peace! i appreciate u checking me out foreal ! what tracks was u feelin?
"I am surprised this is way down the list. I want a cooked breakfast served to be in bed, then everyone has to GTFO of the house and let me sit in front of the TV watching movies, reading a book, playing games or staring at the wall until it's beer time. Then you can come back in and we can have pizza and watch some Disney together. Then you all go to bed and I watch another movie and blissfully fall asleep.

I might get the breakfast. Then I will have to 'do' something.

Bah. Humbug."
It’s very fun but my least favorite of her work (I also generally prefer epic fantasy to urban fantasy though so not unexpected). I’d probably have enjoyed it more if I was more familiar with New York though it still works without that familiarity.
"That makes a lot more sense, too."
"I dunno man, what is?"
Tickets to a broadway show
"Psycho and Citizen Kane, even though everyone already knows both twists."
The bristle with excitement
The queue area is the only good part about that ride
Kids not fighting and a simple Merry Christmas I love you.

"Ya know what. True, let me come back to this."
Fucking seriously?
Fenix Flexin(formerly of Shoreline Mafia) - Vol. 1 is hard hitting!
