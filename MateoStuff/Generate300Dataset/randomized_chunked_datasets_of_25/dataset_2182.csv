936,best desk lamp,"You could also make a monitor shelf out of a board and a couple bricks, and then light the underside of the shelf with adhesive back strip LEDs."
53621,best medicine for a cold,"I got sick in Prague. The cold medicine there doesn‚Äôt require a prescription but it‚Äôs not just on the shelf. Had to talk to the pharmacist and they sold me some of the most intense cough suppressants money can buy. Did. Not. Cough. But also made me very drowsy, dopey and paranoid. So much so that I actually thought I was getting sicker."
68505,best science fiction novel,"Check out the audio book for Dune. It's pretty good I think.

Edit: I'm being downvoted. Well, just wow. Dune is awesome and it has various actors, I think it's pretty darn good."
25973,best cricket teams of all time,Stuart Clarke looks to be the odd one out there.
64762,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,I just don't understand the monys hype. Had the nachos and they were not impressive. Nothing
71737,best movies with a cool twist,"[Super Dark Times](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/super_dark_times) (2017) is a thriller that‚Äôs on Netflix right now. It has a similar vibe to Stand By Me to begin with, with a lot of realistic/humorous back and forth between a group of teenage boys, but things get really weird really quick. I thoroughly enjoyed it"
38357,best newspapers to read,"CLASS is the standard NATO term for 'Classified' ie - only available to people who have been vetted to see it. There are levels of classification from RESTRICTED - Government policy and such, to TOP SECRET POSITIVE CODEWORD which means that only a few people in the world have access to that information. This is real-life briefcase chained to your wrist stuff."
10400,best suitcase lock,"On the way back, yeah, because I bought a sweet spaghetti pot that happened to cost me a few hundred dollars, so I wanted to bring it back with me. Wasn't about the pants, it was about the pot in my bags."
52193,best hiphop album,Ive already heard all of kendricks stuff hes fucking dope

55258,best places to hike in the east coast,"Here's some websites to start you off:

[MidAtlantichikes](http://www.midatlantichikes.com/)

[Hiking Upward](http://www.hikingupward.com/)

[PAHikes](http://www.pahikes.com/)

These are all conveniently close to Maryland and should give you some ideas.  Two loop trips I can suggest are the [Allegheny Front Trail](http://www.pahikes.com/#owlcarousel-4297-1) and the [Trout Run Valley Circumnavigation](http://midatlantichikes.com/troutrunvalley.htm).  The latter has many views and requires some navigation skills."
12643,best gifts for mom,"Something you honestly thought hard about that let‚Äôs me know you absolutely appreciate me. Something that makes me forget the 3rd pair of glasses you broke, the hated meals you didn‚Äôt want to eat, the hours spent driving you everywhere, the extra loads of laundry I did b/c you can‚Äôt hang a towel back up in the bathroom, the lack of sleep b/c you had a bad dream, the lack of sleep b/c I worry about you, the clothes that don‚Äôt fit b/c you‚Äôre growing up so fast, the baby smell you lost years ago, the hugs freely given in public, the quick glimpse you used to always give me when getting on the bus, how easily your tiny hand fit into mine every single time we went anywhere, the feel of your warm breath on my chest when I fed you at 330am, the tackling cuddles you gave me every time I sat on the coach, the endless terrible drawings of the whole family surrounded by hearts and rainbows, the exuberance you had when regaling every single detail of your day to me, the falling asleep with your fingers tangled in my hair when you ‚Äúbraided‚Äù it, the jam hand prints all over the kitchen counter, the chocolate goatee you always seemed to have, the way the word mama fell so easily out of your mouth...  so, maybe just give me all those things and your time to me so it won‚Äôt hurt so much when I think about all that stuff that slipped away so fast. 

Edit: just wow. Thanks for reading this and caring about it. I know it‚Äôs a bit off point, but it just started  pouring out of me when I was responding and it meant enough to me that I continued with posting it. 
So, for the nitpickers: just you. My real joy at Christmas is seeing my kids reaction to what I got them. The hugs, the thank yous, the happy surprised faces, the I love yous are what makes me most happy at Christmas! Linger at the table, hug your mom for no reason, sit next to her on the couch, put your head on her shoulder and just be there."
68943,best science fiction novel,"I'd say it was a lot more whimsical, and honestly fun than the Broken Earth Trilogy. The overwhelming oppressive atmosphere isn't there in the same way. Easily one of the best books I tread this year.

I would recommend getting the audiobook. The performance is absolutely riveting, and there is since some design that actually adds to the story."
28083,best breakfast foods,Banh mi! Vietnamese pork rolls.
373,best terminal file manager reddit,"For GUI : Dolphin, although it causes problems with android phones sometimes.

For CLI : nnn"
43167,best detective show,You are correct. It devolves into a slow moving and anti-climactic police procedural with creepy foot picking scenes as the only memorable event in the 2nd half of the season.
57088,best water brand,Fiji. Because it tastes better than any other water. It has a soft mouth feel.
24378,best anime,"Gundam arguably has a bigger inoact, especially since NGE is an anime influenced by Mobile Suit Gundam, and the fact that Hideki Ano is a well known gundam fan. Gundam as a franchise is #21 in the worlds most profitable IP.

NGE is just morr approachable given that is has less media to work with, and reletively speaking, newer and less daunting than Gundam as a whole."
39303,best web browser,I am on 4k with Firefox with zero issues.
11188,best backpack for college,mine is also ten years old. looks like it's brandnew.
45151,best items under $100,"Arguably a PED for some people. 

I don't personally have an issue with it, but I've seen it help and hurt people. One person became a full blown addict. On the other hand, several people have functioning lives because of it. 

The distribution of outcomes always seems to be on one of two extremes, mostly good, but really bad for some. I guess that goes for a lot of pharmaceuticals."
15206,best tree for the garden,"American mtn ash. Beautiful for most of the growing season. Good growth habits, shade, wildlife value."
39866,best Chrome extensions,"Been there. We had someone quit and we were expected just to absorb the extra job, they weren't hiring anyone else. Managed to automate a good 70% of what he did."
46085,best trick or treating candy,Go buy your own damn candy you freeloaders.
58901,best perfume,"1. Guerlain Mitsouko
2. Guerlain Jicky
3. TF Black Orchid
4. EL Youth Dew
5. Guerlain Shalimar

I can only give you a top 5 at this point. I am very indecisive and inconsistent!!! I love amber fragrances & chypres the most. I'm starting to get into fougeres, woody florals, and green fragrances as well."
