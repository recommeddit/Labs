26880,"**Beyond the Sun** is a unique and interesting worker placement/area control game that I really like, and has an awesome resource mechanic, but I do think it is hindered by some issues. The art direction is functional, but pretty bland. The variable worker placement spots could be more interesting/game breaking and there could be more of them (there IS an expansion coming which should fix this). It's definitely overpriced. Most importantly though, I think the board is just too big. You have to read a lot of cards, and, for instance, if you're sitting on the side of the table away from the area control board you have no idea what's going on over there, which is probably going to dictate your playstyle more than anything. 

**Stellar** is just an awesome and extremely underrated 2-player game. I still play it frequently, and just picked up the multiplayer ""sequel"" **Subastral**. This game gets a huge recommend. 

**Oceans** I really wanted to like, and I played it a couple more times before selling it. The presentation is really good, but I think I just don't love games where I have to be looking at other people's tableaus all the time. I found it a little too mean for my tastes, and my friends found it a lot too mean for theirs. It is the only game that my wife has ever said she'd never play again, and we play mean games all the time. 

I only played **Fort** the once, almost a year ago now, and I don't remember much about it other than the great presentation. I only played it with 2, it might be more exciting at higher counts.",best board games

118,"You gain a consistent interface.

Can yout tell me without looking how to add 3 files to an existing zip file? To a rar file? To a 7z file? And how do you extract only 3 files from each? And how to do the same on a remote server (via sftp)? And view a PDF that is in a remote location and/or in an archived file with considerable ease? And search for all files that contains a string within an archive? In a remote location? And then copy all such files into a given location?

With mc, you can do all that fairly transparently. You don't need to learn how to do it for each archive format, and for each virtual file system. If you know how to do it with one ""system"", you can do it with all. 

Yeah sure mc doesn't give you any *capability* that you don't have with the command line. It does ease some tasks considerably, though.",best terminal file manager reddit

57130,"This is an interesting topic and maybe it needed a [Serious] tag.

After living in the Midwest and having access to magnificent tasting tap water, I moved to SoCal, where the tap water tastes like it came out of the brow of a greasy teenager. I have to buy water so it's something I've spent plenty of time thinking about.

Flat water, I'm partial to Mexican Bonafont. It's leaps and bounds tastier than anything else I've ever tasted. In the U.S., I've found it at several Mexican grocers and the price isn't outrageous. I like Fiji and the Costco brand a lot too. I loathe Evian, Arrowhead and Crystal Geyser.
