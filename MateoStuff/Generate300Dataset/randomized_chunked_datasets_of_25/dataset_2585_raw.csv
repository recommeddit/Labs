"I read many of those reviews before I purchased. I've only had mine for a year, and it's working pretty well still. I felt like it was inexpensive enough that I could purchase a new filtering mount when those problems arose."
I'm disappointed that is the box boxes of sex panther come in.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expected but it sure involved more purple velour.

"As a vi guy, I've been using vifm for many years now and have often recommended it here on reddit and sites like kmandla's old blog.  But in my opinion it's beginning to suffer from feature bloat, so I'm considering alternatives.

To my mind, the ""vi way"" is to leverage external programs as much as possible rather than building the same functionality into a single, monolithic program.  vifm seems to be straying from that path, in an attempt perhaps to match Midnight Commander feature for feature...

File managers, btw, are to the shell utilities (cp, mv, etc.) what full-screen text editors like vi or emacs are to ed.   They show you the context of what you're working on and many people (including myself) find this useful.

"pocket sized USB battery pack.

it's about the size of a lipstick tube so it fits in my pocket without trouble and i never have to worry about my phone dying after a late night out ever again (or at least, until i forget to recharge the battery pack)."

"Nah, once I saw how smooth 144Hz was, I only wanted more.  240Hz is as clear as panning over to something with your own eyes.  I absolutely love it so far."
Si by Armani! I actually don’t like it that much (it’s very sweet) but I have to finish the bottle. I always get complimented and it lasts all day!

"How clicky are the buttons on the case for you? I've got the leather case for my 13 Pro but the buttons (especially the power button) are very mushy and hard to press when compared to the leather case for the 11 Pro I had before.

Not sure if normal or a defective case."
Could anyone recommend a clean/non-sexual or religious contemporary or futuristic romance that's on their To-Read list?

Caron Pour Une Homme is another classic fougere that may work. I have not tried it myself but I've heard great things from everyone who has!
"Oh. My. God.  That poor woman.  If she's anything like my good innocent Catholic mother, i'm horrified for you."
"Oh, because I'm supposed to write a spreadsheet program that exceeds Excel? Even though there is no real use for it as runtime execution is a significant performance hit. 

Everything, I've said is established fact. 

FYI this script will defeat anything you can run in Excel. (Matrix-Matrix product, performed linearly to avoid excessive indexing calls). Nearly beats Fortran Matmul (in fact it does beat it at low optimizations, but loses at -O6), so yes it's super-fast.  

    fn multiply(&self, other: &Self)-> Matrix<f64>
     {
     let mut z = Matrix::<f64>{data: vec![], dimen: (self.dimen.0,other.dimen.1)};
       for k in 0..self.dimen.0{
       for i in 0..other.dimen.1{
       let mut k:f64 =0.0;
       for j in 0..self.dimen.1{
        
        k+=self.data[j+ (k*self.dimen.1)] * other.data[j*other.dimen.1+i];
          }
                z.data.push(k);
           }
           }
           z
           }
     }

If you can beat this in Excel, I will eat my shit (You can't it's impossible). 

Excel is computationally worthless. There are better ways to implement it."

"Breakfast burritos.

I cook up a bunch of egg/sausage mix on Sunday and either wrap em up right then, or just store it in the fridge and do 1 or 2 quick wraps each morning. Usually add a dollop of salsa too.

I haven't eaten cereal in the morning since school, but sometimes if I'm up early I'll eat a quick bowl."
