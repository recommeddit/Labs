11460,best gifts for dad,"Oh, was I supposed to prepare a picnic lunch and sing a little song?  I didn't think I was 'unfriendly' or 'unhelpful' the first time.  

Americans, can't speak for Germans, fuck up apostrophes CONSTANTLY these days.  Almost everyone under 30 puts an apostrophe on a plural s, where there should be none.  It is a stupid basic mistake that contributes to making us look like a country of idiots.  As an English teacher, rather than killing them, I simply point it out.

So maybe you should avoid butting in (or in German, being a Besserwisser) in a situation that doesn't involve you (or Germans).  You are not the OP."

71119,best movies with a cool twist,"Always loved Taylor's face when Zaius had Cornellius read the scroll out on the beach. He doesn't even try to argue.

For all Taylor's antagonism towards Zaius, he has pretty much the same opinion of man. The whole reason he was on the mission in the first place was because he'd become disillusioned with humanity. He expresses the sames views as Zaius does at the beginning of the film."

40972,best instrument to play,Guitar is tricky with the mixed tuning. But you could absolutely make an argument that scales and intervals are easier to learn on bass (which is all 4ths) than piano.

65785,best college in california,"No real surprise, the CSU system has always been looked down upon because they're not ""prestigious"" , likely because they're not research schools. Cal poly is leagues ahead of all the other CSUs (and many of the UCs IMO) at teaching actually usable skills and getting people into well paying jobs, but it still isn't well known outside of California. 

Source: Cal poly grad who moved out of state. The only people here who realize how good of a school Cal poly is are other CP grads"

44523,best items under $100,"Whoa, ordering one now. My husband has insanely thick, wavy hair and he gets so frustrated with it. This might buy me a few more years of a long-haired husband before he gets fed up and shaves it all off."
41512,best instrument to play,"Another one for piano here. Imo it is laid out the most logically and is the easiest way to really dig in to the theory part of things. Once you get some of the basics you can always use your piano knowledge as a reference to learn other instruments.

I've seen very good multi instrumentalists go back to the piano time and again to work out melodies, rhythms, etc. and apply that knowledge to all sorts of different instruments. 

Once you start getting a grasp of some of the basic patterns it is a magical thing and really fun. Music is the language of the universe. Start today and you will be surprised how quickly you can pick it up. Have fun and good luck!"
