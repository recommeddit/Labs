11460,"Oh, was I supposed to prepare a picnic lunch and sing a little song?  I didn't think I was 'unfriendly' or 'unhelpful' the first time.  

Americans, can't speak for Germans, fuck up apostrophes CONSTANTLY these days.  Almost everyone under 30 puts an apostrophe on a plural s, where there should be none.  It is a stupid basic mistake that contributes to making us look like a country of idiots.  As an English teacher, rather than killing them, I simply point it out.

So maybe you should avoid butting in (or in German, being a Besserwisser) in a situation that doesn't involve you (or Germans).  You are not the OP.",best gifts for dad

He expresses the sames views as Zaius does at the beginning of the film.",best movies with a cool twist

65785,"No real surprise, the CSU system has always been looked down upon because they're not ""prestigious"" , likely because they're not research schools. Cal poly is leagues ahead of all the other CSUs (and many of the UCs IMO) at teaching actually usable skills and getting people into well paying jobs, but it still isn't well known outside of California.

41512,"Another one for piano here. Imo it is laid out the most logically and is the easiest way to really dig in to the theory part of things. Once you get some of the basics you can always use your piano knowledge as a reference to learn other instruments.

I've seen very good multi instrumentalists go back to the piano time and again to work out melodies, rhythms, etc. and apply that knowledge to all sorts of different instruments. 

Once you start getting a grasp of some of the basic patterns it is a magical thing and really fun. Music is the language of the universe. Start today and you will be surprised how quickly you can pick it up. Have fun and good luck!",best instrument to play
