The owner says it was inspired by a street in Charleston, SC (and you can find it on Google street view and it's gorgeous). It's definitely floral, which I think DE is best at, but it's a gorgeous summery floral. On the opening I smell mostly gardenia and magnolia, but you get more of a salty air smell and a slight tea smell as it settles on your skin. It lasts really long on me, and I get compliments on it a lot.",best perfume

26750,"It's my favourite game by far, and I'm always tooting its horn: **Hanabi**. Simple cooperative card game that does not suffer from the so-called 'alpha gamer' problem. You can find copies for 10$ online, 15$ in local stores; one of the cheapest games I own, and has been played dozens of times.

In the card game category, **Citadels** is called an evergreen for good reasons; simple to understand, carries easily. Medium-weight, but a classic in my group.

If you're at all into abstract games, **Hive** is *the* modern abstract game (with **The Duke** coming in at a close second). Absolute must have for chess and checkers lovers looking to diversify.

If you (plan to) do a lot of 1-on-1 gaming, I'd argue both **Android: Netrunner** and **Summoner Wars** (either the Master Set or the upcoming Alliances Master Set) are must-haves (but their themes might not appeal to everybody).

If you're into large group games, or host 8-12 people often, **Mascarade** plays wonderfully well in those late evenings where the party dies down. Another 20$ that got tons of mileage.

A well-rounded collection would likely include one or two gateway games, to hook new gamers: **Takenoko**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Alhambra** or a coop like **Pandemic** (especially in it's **Pandemic: The Cure** form: much less think-y, much more approachable by non-gamers).",best board games
