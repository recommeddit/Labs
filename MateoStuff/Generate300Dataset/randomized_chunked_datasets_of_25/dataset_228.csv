53321,best usb c charging cable,"For fast charging I use an anker cable, probably the bast cable money can buy.   But on the other hand I use a cabepow 'elwire' cable for my night stand cable since it let's me see if my phone is charged without even touching my phone."
46807,best hand santizer brand,"While the article is inaccurate, the reddit headline isn't. The CDC's official stance is that soap & water should be preferred if available.

That doesn't mean using both is bad for you..."
39153,best web browser,"I already do that, it works to a certain extent but it‚Äôs not cutting it anymore. So the main issue is with Chromium? Even if they are supposedly lightweight options?"

58908,best perfume,"I can try! I'm pretty bad at describing scents though, sorry. For me there's something about it that takes me straight to summers in Hilton Head Island. The owner says it was inspired by a street in Charleston, SC (and you can find it on Google street view and it's gorgeous). It's definitely floral, which I think DE is best at, but it's a gorgeous summery floral. On the opening I smell mostly gardenia and magnolia, but you get more of a salty air smell and a slight tea smell as it settles on your skin. It lasts really long on me, and I get compliments on it a lot."
54798,best water filter,"If you don't mind doing some installation.   Go to Home Depot and look at the whole house cartridge filters.  There is one they sell for $20.  Cartridges are $7.  Will go 6 months easy.  Hook to your cold water under sink, preferably before it goes to ice maker if you have one, then you will be filtering both.  Usually the connections for an  easy install will be less than 15 bucks.  I put these in for people all the time and they love them."

26750,best board games,"It's my favourite game by far, and I'm always tooting its horn: **Hanabi**. Simple cooperative card game that does not suffer from the so-called 'alpha gamer' problem. You can find copies for 10$ online, 15$ in local stores; one of the cheapest games I own, and has been played dozens of times.

In the card game category, **Citadels** is called an evergreen for good reasons; simple to understand, carries easily. Medium-weight, but a classic in my group.

If you're at all into abstract games, **Hive** is *the* modern abstract game (with **The Duke** coming in at a close second). Absolute must have for chess and checkers lovers looking to diversify.

If you (plan to) do a lot of 1-on-1 gaming, I'd argue both **Android: Netrunner** and **Summoner Wars** (either the Master Set or the upcoming Alliances Master Set) are must-haves (but their themes might not appeal to everybody).

If you're into large group games, or host 8-12 people often, **Mascarade** plays wonderfully well in those late evenings where the party dies down. Another 20$ that got tons of mileage.

A well-rounded collection would likely include one or two gateway games, to hook new gamers: **Takenoko**, **Ticket to Ride**, **Alhambra** or a coop like **Pandemic** (especially in it's **Pandemic: The Cure** form: much less think-y, much more approachable by non-gamers)."

32737,best vacation resort,"Hahaha, sorry I forgot you were pointing out that they are planning an imaginary trip! 

No worries, I‚Äôm half joking here.

I'm female but wear a men's size 11 (US sizes), and I have a thumb-sized gap between my big toe and second toe, plus visible space between my little toes. I'm a control group to prove that modern shoes absolutely deform our feet."
