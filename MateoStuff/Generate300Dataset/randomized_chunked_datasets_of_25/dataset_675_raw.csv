"When I lived in a neighborhood with some friends from college, we set out a bowl with a sign that says take 1. 

Being the bored college kids we were, we hid in the bushes and around the porch and scared the shit out of any kids who didn't obey the sign.

One kid actually took the entire bowl and probably shit his pants a few moments later."
"That was my first reaction too so I get it and if Endgame didn’t focus on it, I’d totally agree but they make you and the characters sit with it. And this is probably just me but I could see the sliver of possibility that Nakia/Okoye/M’Baku become BP and they make Miles Spider-Man.  Not saying likely, but I could see it. Because frankly I hate that we know all this behind the scenes crap and dont want to hold that against a movie that again, shocked me when it ended!"
thank you for dealing with me :P

"Everyone has said what I would have said about brands (the comment about having 3 ""types"" of sunnies is solid gold advice) so Imma just speak to the importance of trying them on. 

When it comes to the more expensive purchases ($200.00+) I think having a chance to feel the quality of the frame and seeing how they look on your face is important. Sometimes little details like the width of the arms or like the angle of the nose peice totally change how the glasses feel/look.

Once you've figured out your fave brand/frame ordering online to change up the lense or frame combo is less stressful."
Razer Viper Ultimate is the best money  can buy in terms of wireless mice and tech. It is better than GPW because many GPW are known to develop double click issues. Razer Viper Ultimate will never develop those issues because it uses optical switches for m1 and m2. Plus the coating on the RVU offer better grip than the coating of the GPW.
It's hands down the funniest series.
You'd have a point if the article wasn't solely about the ability of hand sanitizers vs. soap and water to kill germs.
And has way more terrible puns

"I will say that the flynit racer really didnt reappear in 2016, it never went away really"
"Hi, this person summarized exactly what I’m looking for too but my budget is a little higher around < $1,000. Would you still recommend the same thing? I usually prefer something sturdy with a larger screen and not too thin. Thank you!!"
It’s been 3 years since the World Cup
Yeah they did.  The Forbes ranking is pretty useless because of the data they use.  Garbage in - garbage out.
"I actually don’t remember really learning a lot about it, if anything I learned about it maybe in elementary or middle school? definitely not high school though"
"If the goal is to read unbiased news sources, what better way than setting politics aside and looking instead at the evidence?"
Uruguay should be #5 imo.
