25208,best spiderman actor,"I really liked Tobey's version, but I think Tom, his age, and the writing came together to make the current version the best one. The writing in Homecoming is being seriously underrated IMO, it takes really great writing to make Peter's character and Spidey's character come together so well, especially in little moments. After that, Holland sold the hell out of it."

28879,best breakfast foods,"I started making oatmeal on Sundays and putting individual portions in 1-pint jars. I cook steel-cut oats for about 3 minutes and then mix them with whatever I have on hand - vanilla extract, chia seeds, walnuts, honey, almond/peanut butter etc. Top each one with fruits like apple, pineapple, banana, etc. Every morning I just put the jar in the microwave for about a minute and maybe add some maple syrup. It's quick and delicious."
