22189,best celebrity,"Will Smith.
I did some computer work for him at his house. I ended up sitting in his library with him for a couple of hours , joking around and having a good time. He is a lot like he is in the movies actually , he's pretty funny , joking around and making me feel very comfortable. Half the time I was expecting a giant robot or alien or some shit to come bursting through the wall or something.  I was actually there for so long that he insisted that he have his chef make me some dinner. It was a pretty cool day. His wife is nice too."

30161,best Mexican war to study,"A lot of historians think so; Mexican *and* American historians. 

I think he probably really cared about Mexico.  Or at least he cared about Mexico’s greatness. 

The problem was, he appeared to believe that his *own* greatness was tied to his *country’s* greatness.  If he was “great,” then his country would be too. It’s not a good formula for leadership.

But his ego was just insufferable.  And so was his cynical indifference.  He spent *enormous* amounts of Mexico’s treasury on lavish dinner parties and balls in order to make himself appear more important.  He was disdainful to just about everyone around him, and thought of the average citizen more like inconsequential peasants than fellow countrymen.  He didn’t even pretend to care about them.

He was just one of those guys who *could* have been great.  But he just kept getting in his own way."

13169,best gifts for mom,"I was dying for a prenatal massage, my hubby got me a gift certificate, but I never booked it, I now have a 4.5 month old, and still have a massage gift certificate - I would use it, but I have no sitters, and our weekends have been crazy. But I have a Kindle (actually, it was also a gift from my hubby, he is pretty awesome), and it is great for when I am nursing and want to do something, but the TV would wake my husband, or our older daughter, and books are kind of awkward to hold (although I will balance one on the Boppy, if I can't get the book I want from the library on my Kindle, but they have a hard copy.) I don't even have the Fire, so I am just reading, but I do love it!"

28724,best breakfast foods,"In Nicaragua we had gallo pinto (rice and red beans), tortillas, [cuajada](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevesworldofphotos/3843717609/) (a type of cheese), eggs occasionally. On my first visit there however, my hosts were eager to impress and every morning we had fried red snapper, rice, plantains, and cabbage salad. They also consider [nacatamales](http://recipesdeluxe.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/nacatamale-6.jpg) with strong coffee a breakfast delicacy! I found a lot of the food there an acquired taste, but once I started liking it, I *loved* it."

16131,best sunglasses for fashion,"Only brand I wear anymore, although I always go up to the second ""tier"" or whatever. The basic ones look very cheap with the huge logo on the side."
40971,best instrument to play,"Just to clear this out, I didn't say guitar is harder or easier then classical strings. The layout I mentioned was aimed at the string tuning (4ths and one 3rd) which is a horrible layout for anyone who is using it to learn theory. 

After so much time on both instruments I cannot personally understand how a guitar could be better for scales and intervals then a guitar, but both our opinions here are biased and subjective over preference."
61291,Best RPG game on PS4,The two South Park games.
31609,best hotel to live in,"Are we talking the nicest suite in a property, or the nicest property itself?

The Park Hyatt in Sanya would be near the top of any list. People were constantly sneaking onto the property to take photos for social media.

The Andaz in Shanghai is really really nice, and their suites are incredible."
