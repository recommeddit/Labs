I did some computer work for him at his house. I ended up sitting in his library with him for a couple of hours , joking around and having a good time. He is a lot like he is in the movies actually , he's pretty funny , joking around and making me feel very comfortable. Half the time I was expecting a giant robot or alien or some shit to come bursting through the wall or something.  I was actually there for so long that he insisted that he have his chef make me some dinner. It was a pretty cool day. His wife is nice too.",best celebrity

30161,"A lot of historians think so; Mexican *and* American historians. 

I think he probably really cared about Mexico.  Or at least he cared about Mexico’s greatness. 

The problem was, he appeared to believe that his *own* greatness was tied to his *country’s* greatness.  If he was “great,” then his country would be too. It’s not a good formula for leadership.

But his ego was just insufferable.  And so was his cynical indifference.  He spent *enormous* amounts of Mexico’s treasury on lavish dinner parties and balls in order to make himself appear more important.  He was disdainful to just about everyone around him, and thought of the average citizen more like inconsequential peasants than fellow countrymen.  He didn’t even pretend to care about them.

He was just one of those guys who *could* have been great.  But he just kept getting in his own way.",best Mexican war to study

After so much time on both instruments I cannot personally understand how a guitar could be better for scales and intervals then a guitar, but both our opinions here are biased and subjective over preference.",best instrument to play
