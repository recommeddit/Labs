The first game I've ever played on a 360 was Alan Wake. Highly recommend it
"No they're trying to use an analogy to prove something irrelevant. That's a logical fallacy. 

Analogies should be used to describe situations, processes, items etc. Not prove something."
"LA has the best food in the country, followed closely by San Francisco or New York City imo."
"Might be on the linked lists... but I love Neal Stephenson.

Some of his books are on the longer side, but worth the payoff.
