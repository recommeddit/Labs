"It gets better.  You're probably not doing anything wrong.  When I was in high-school I was a real dick to my mom.  Everything she did was just to annoy me, rather just be left alone, etc. etc.  I'm 21 now and I talk to my mom all the time.  Calls, texts, emails when I'm not home ... actually spending time together when I am.  Nothing really changed, I just grew out of it.

Unfortunately the truth is that you probably won't get anything sincere out of them if they're at that age.  You might get some flowers or a card, but only because it was convenient to pick them up somewhere or someone helped them along.  When they say Happy Mother's Day it's more so that they know they should rather than that they want to.  Don't take it out on them, though ... it's only temporary.  In a few years mom won't be distracting them from the text message; the text messages will be distracting them from mom."

"My dad tells us the story of a coffee date he went on in college, and the girl he was with noticed Tim Curry was there ordering a coffee. She keeps trying to make eye contact but eventually realised that Tim was checking out my dad! 

I'll be honest my dad's not a very serious man, but he swears this one is true. Either way take it with a grain of salt"
"I think you're ignoring all the points I mentioned. It just got some commits after largerly being ignored. Just take a look at the [commit frequency](https://github.com/axios/axios/graphs/commit-activity), or the bigger thread I linked that details how badly they handled a 2 year old security vulnerability."
"Late to the party, but Tabs for a Cause.

Every time you open a new tap it shows like 2 ads but you earn a  heart. 1 <3 = 1¢. You donate hearts to charities. Really cool.
