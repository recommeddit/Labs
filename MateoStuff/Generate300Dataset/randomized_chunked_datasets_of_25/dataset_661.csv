48057,best color to paint with,"I had a home built in the '60s, all original. Green kitchen appliances. Yellow, gold glittered counters and floor. Wood panel walls. Pink toilet. Red-orange carpet. Stained spongy ceiling tiles. Mirrors everywhere.

Disgustingly ugly all around. But I loved that green kitchen."
32678,best vacation resort,"Couldn't disagree with this more.

Have done 2 all inclusive trips to Punta Cana and 1 to Cancun and only turned 30 the day before yesterday.  Forget Cancun.  Punta Cana is a great time (and I've also been lucky enough to do Grand Cayman, Grenada and travel much of the rest of the world).

The question is what do you expect out of an all-inclusive?  Are you looking for motorized watersports?  Diving?  Trips?  

In my mind the best part of an all inclusive trip is this:  you know what you are going to pay. If you go to PC you know the food is going to be just fine and your drinks are going to be free.  The value of not having to pull your wallet out nonstop is pretty much invaluable.  

Majestic Colonial and Excellence in PC were pretty darn nice.  The Excellence also have an adults only area which is great.

One other caveat - the above depends entirely on your budget.  If you can spend $3k/person for a week, screw the all inclusive and go to Asia.  If you want to do $3k all in, then try the all inclusive...."
8434,best toothpaste,"As long as it’s got fluoride and not charcoal it’s good. 

Spit don’t rinse, the whole point of using paste is cleaning then leaving tooth protective stuff on your teeth, rinsing washes it off! It’s like putting your coat on to keep warm to go out to not get wet then taking it off when you go outside! It’s a habit hard to kick if you are used to it!

It’s the technique that makes a difference. Where the gum meets the tooth (front and back) twice a day for 2 mins and in between with interdental brushes/ floss once a day. 

Electric brushes with pressure sensors and timers make brushing piss easy and can even be enjoyable. Change heads every 3 months like you should be doing with your brush anyway and if it’s wearing too quickly you need to be more gentle.

Also if you have to use mouthwash, (preferably with fluoride in) use it 30 mins after brushing or during the day, you don’t want to wash off what you just spent 2 mins putting on!

Note- am dental nurse not dentist but give oral health advise most days"

10611,best suitcase lock,I never understand why people pay to have there bags travel wrapped. Surely it just looks like you have something to hide? As long as you have travel insurance you’re covered anyway.

55719,best action and adventure novel series,"I'm currently reading the Draconis Memoria series by Anthony Ryan (starting with the Waking Fire), and I think that could potentially be a great fit. It's set in a pseudo Victorian-era timeframe (think East India Trading Company) and includes well-written dragons, magic, corporate espianage, pirates, ancient relics, and tons of adventures in a huge number of locations (from deserts to forests to polar ice caps and even a prison city).

The final book in the trilogy is coming out this summer (I mistakenly thought it was complete when I started reading it), but I'm really enjoying it so far."

Fugees\- The Score

Dynospectrum\- The Dynospectrum

JMT\- Violent By Design

Nas\- Hip\-Hop is Dead (IMO this album is criminally underrated)

Cypress Hill\- Temples of Boom

Skitzofreniks\- Enter The Realm

Eric B. & Rakim\- Paid in Full

Big Pun\- Capital Punishment

Bonus (what I'm listening to currently):

42310,movies like Inception,"This what I was going to suggest too.  It's a lovely film but fills me with both great sadness and happiness.  Not a massive 'mindfuck', but until you understand the film you're not sure what is real and what isn't.

I think I need to watch it again, it's been a while."
