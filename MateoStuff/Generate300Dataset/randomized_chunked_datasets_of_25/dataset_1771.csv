45256,best gaming system,"That's a good point. I've recently got a 4k projector, so I'm just looking to explore gaming on a big screen. It's all about fun obviously, it just seems like there's so much choice. 

What games do you play on console and/or pc?"
10773,best suitcase lock,"Nah.  Some guy opened it and said ""Sweet!  I get to sit on my ass and unwrap bottles for the next hour!"""

46670,best hand santizer brand,Costco has GermX gallon sized bottles for $15. I think it’s limited to 1/customer
25306,best spiderman actor,Hmm kinda agree with that. Now that I think about it.
67674,axios alternatives reddit,I read that as “the one maintained on **my** GitHub”. I was thinking how in the fuck did you get the username GitHub 😂
31678,best hotel to live in,I've made a bunch of acquaintances.  Sometimes I'll be invited to a party or something.  Maybe I'm a little anti-social or something but I think there is a threshold in a relationship where nothing can ever be awkward and it takes almost no energy to have a good time.  I've never reached that with anyone other than a few people.  The rest of it feels like a lot of work to keep the night going.  But I'm a good listener when I want to be and most of the time I'm just hearing people's stories.
70795,best movies with a cool twist,Identity (2003) for me. My 13-year-old mind was not prepared for that ending.

2587,best headphones,"Those are some mind boggling bargains. Like holy shit. Even in the used world. Dunno if its an accurate reflection for ""pricing sweet spot for headphones"". I guess for this post's sake, its best to compare new prices only. 

but jesus. $99 bucks for q701? thats amazing. thats endgameworthy for some. (i know, insubstantial statement as earpods are endgameworthy for the masses)."
43064,best detective show,"I loved The Missing, and was wondering recently whether it was going to continue.  Baptiste is a great character (and ties the 2 seasons together), so I'm thrilled that they did a spinoff with him.  Anyone know if Starz is going to air it in the US, like they did with The Missing."
67746,axios alternatives reddit,"> Well for one it's not entirely supported across all browsers as it's a relatively new browser API. If you are strictly working in chrome it's not a big deal. Once you move into ie or safari then you need polyfills and such.

Fetch is supported in Safari (both Mac & iOS), Chrome (desktop & Android), Firefox, Edge, and almost everything else: https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch. Every single browser release since later 2016 has supported fetch.

If you're still supporting IE (not Edge; real IE), then you need add a tiny [fetch polyfill](https://github.com/developit/unfetch). For everybody else, it just works out of the box."
7515,best laptop for general use,"Looking for a laptop for med school. No gaming, just work. Would like for it to be able to stream movies and videos well but priority is ability to have multiple tabs open, run excel, and PowerPoint at the same time. Also have Bluetooth capabilities. Price range is <4000$ but priority is good deal for the price and able to do the above without overheating or needing a reset. I’m fine with waiting longer for better if something is just around the corner but if not I’ll pull the trigger now. Not necessary but nice: Possibly able to plug in and share screen with hdmi, able to plug in headphones, a mouse, a second screen if I had one. External audio input and output would be nice as well although yet again not necessary. Any recommendations?"
30585,best Mexican war to study,"I wasn't making an judgment one way or another on either -- just lining up your two opinions side-by-side.

WWI was ""justified"" in a certain sense, but generally a mistake in my opinion.

With Afghanistan: we had no real proof that OBL planned the September 11th, 2001 attacks (and I believe we still don't have any that he was active in the details or the go-ahead) but if he wanted to place himself at the head of Al-Qaeda he gets to be responsible for its actions. And the September 11th, 2001 attacks were not the first attack by OBL's Al-Qaeda on Americans. And certainly the content of OBL's statements in the 1997-2001 period rise to the level of the Zimmerman Telegram in terms of explicit threat to the United States

So, apart from the ""right"" or ""wrong"", it just seems to me that the standards being used to judge WWI and Afghanistan aren't the same."
