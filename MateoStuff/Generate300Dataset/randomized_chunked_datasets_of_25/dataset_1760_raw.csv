"I agree 100%. East Coast always brought the best flava to hip hop. Not saying West Coast G Funk was ass  2pac, Snoop, etc were all goats in they own right."
Forza Motorsport. Lol. Seriously I've been playing NFS games and they suck now. Maybe Dirt. I heard good things about it.
How about 5 things no one gives a shit about because AdBlock isn’t a real ad blocker. Ublock Origin is the one and only

Funny that we think of a bronze medal as being pretty good in Olympic events, but somehow you are shit if you don't win the World Cup.

I think Belgium did about as well as they could've. I suppose on paper they had the weapons to win a big one with KdB, Lukaku, Hazard, etc, but on the international scene you are just going to run into those huge nations like Spain, Brazil, Germany, and France who have the same infrastructure for development and a much bigger population. It's not impossible (see: Greece, Portugal), but the margin for error is razor thin.

I think Belgium can be proud of what they achieved."

I'm surprised this was mentioned so late. It's one of the few movies I've gone in without knowing the plot and just been completely blown away. One of my favorites.
I've been doing that for years and I haven't seen any improvements

"Honestly, I think there's no competition, Dre's magnum opus is one of the best produced albums period (imo). Some will say ""the chronic"" is his best, but I think  2001 is a near perfect album for what it was trying to do.

Dre is a fucking magician."
