59170,best perfume,Stella from the Tocca line. It is sublime! You can find it at Sephora for a sample.
37705,best Marvel movie,"Best: Avengers 1, Iron Man 1, Infinity War, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 \*and Thor: Ragnarok, that was brilliant, too

Worst: ehh, Thor: The Dark World, Captain Marvel"
918,best desk lamp,"Planet makes durable desk lamps, pretty standard looking and a touch of a collectors item but they're fucking good."
56991,best water brand,Not surprising. I studied abroad there and every couple of weeks we were told to boil then freeze our water before finally thawing it to drink. I spent most of my 6 months there sick.
66790,best soccer team in the world,"Some of the Danish national players should get a higher value.

Andreas Christensen is the second highest valued Dane for €30m. But that doesn't even make him a top 50 most expensive Defender on Transfermarkt.  

For example Nathan Ake and Kurt Zouma who are both older than Andreas Christensen and didn't make the Chelsea team are valued higher on Transfermarkt than Andreas Christensen."
50635,best rap album,I'd probably say Eminem's Marshall Mathers LP. Dre said it was his best work.  Also the N.W.A niggazforlife album. Great production all around in these albums.
41952,movies like Inception,"Visually, Dr Strange all the way. Can’t believe no one has suggested it..."
5271,best home improvement store,You're awesome. Thanks for the list!
64235,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"On telegram you've got the bot ""Nexus Search"" which browse a few of these sites for you and makes it very convenient."
12359,best gifts for mom,"Probably some bullshit reason like ""there isn't enough people buying flights to lower prices"" when in fact lowering the prices would likely lead to a lot more people buying flights. Or because the companies know they can take advantage of people because people will end up buying flights when needed regardless of cost. Or... well there's a lot of possibilities honestly.

Edit: it's a mix of both, but moreso the major issue is the airport fees/taxes. The rent airports pay to the government is ridiculous. If that was lowered, it would likely lower cost of flights and allow more competitive airlines to come to Canada."
38276,best newspapers to read,Definitely The Week because its just a digest and gives multiple perspectives of issues.
7544,best laptop for general use,Is the HP spectre ×360 any good?
42749,best detective show,Why haven’t you watched Dexter?
71975,best movies with a cool twist,"Am I the only one who think Thanos is going to win in the first part? 

I mean, they told us that the Avengers Infinity War will divided into 2 parts so of course that the heroes aren't going to win in the first. I just didn't expect that the heroes will turn into dusts at the end of it."
39222,best web browser,Go for firefox.
8276,best toothpaste,">If you haven't removed the old rotting food from your teeth, why bother removing it from your plates and silverware?

Because I don't cover my plates and silverware in saliva. People should still floss though."
12477,best gifts for mom,"I found old journals in my moms room that my grandmother (her mother) wrote in every single day. I mean, 7-9 years worth of journals. Starting from before my sisters birth, my brothers and my birth.  The journals ended when I was about 3 or 4 years old because that’s when she died. She wrote in them everyday until she died. I learned a lot from those journals. Anyway, I decided to type the journals. I typed them exactly how she wrote them. I turned it all into a book. I went through old family albums and included pictures. I also Included scanned pictures of my grandmothers journal entries. My mom cried. She cried so hard when she opened that present. It was bittersweet for her as she always misses her parents at Christmas but she loved the present. She immediately read the book of journals I made for her and she still goes back and reads the journals all the time.  It took me about 8 months to make that Christmas present for her. I gave her other presents but saved that one for last as a surprise."
10845,best suitcase lock,"You can file with TSA to get the value of what was stolen or damaged back. 

TSA dropped my motorcycle helmet and they cut me a cheque to replace it. I had to provide a letter from an expert on motorcycle safety saying how dropping a helmet compromises it's ability to protect me in a crash and that a helmet should be tested or replaced, the $500 replacement was cheaper and easier than international shipping and inspection fees plus the possibility of having to replace it anyways.

Plus it was cool having a $500 cheque from the USA government, especially since I'm Canadian! 

Also in my last few flights and border crossings to the USA I have never had any problems."
34916,best NFL player,Damn and here I was sad that I couldn’t justify pushing him up from no. 13 and it felt like an under-rank
46628,best trick or treating candy,I like them but I would think Snickers would be represented more.
36593,best alcoholic drink,"I've recently been making similar - whiskey, extra bitters, a few dashes of orange bitters"
67784,axios alternatives reddit,"So in other words not really. Just boilerplate code that lets you avoid using ugly nodejs event emitters and stuff.

I think if you just tinker around with njs for mock backends or whatever (like me) you're good with http(s) but if you are coding complex backend-heavy websites then you might benefit from using one of the above modules.

On the flip side you might be coding complex server logic and might benefit from having less dependencies and lower level control over requests... 

But I digress, it depends (as always) on what you're doing and what you need and what kind of programmer you are."
12732,best gifts for mom,"As a 21 yo in college, this is nice to hear. I don't like talking to mom much on the phone, but I do hate it when I don't get to call her much because it makes me feel like a dick. The idea above is certainly a good one."
827,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,White chocolate with salty liquorice
71182,best movies with a cool twist,*The Last Broadcast.*  Last I checked it was on Prime.
