"I googled it because OC is a moron and can't link to proof.

He's said some riqué things in the past. None of which are egregious enough to call him a misogynist, IMO. He's even gone on to renounce some of the things he said in [this](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/10/26/LaughterInTheMaleDominatedRoom.html) blog post.

[This](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/10/26/LaughterInTheMaleDominatedRoom.html) is what /r/programming had to say about it. (The usual anti-sjw sentiment, I guess.)

From reading his article, I think this is a false alarm. /u/datascigeek is using the term too loosely here IMO (not to mention that not backing their statement up while saying things like this is fucking stupid and why they shouldn't be believed.)"

Having said that - if you are Looking for recommendations you cant really go wrong reading Asimov, Heinlein, leGuin and Philip K dick"
"I walked out of the park very surprised at what ended up being my two favorite coasters of the day when I went for the first time this past march. Going in to the day I was expecting to walk out with Twisted Colossus as my favorite, with maybe X2 or Tatsu right behind it. 

Instead I would actually say my favorites were:

1. Full throttle 
2. Superman: Escape from Krypton
3. Riddler’s Revenge

I got super lucky and almost every ride was a walk on all day, and the only closed ride was Green Lantern. 

My first ride of the day was X2 on the front inside left, and it was one of the best and most unique rides I’ve ever had. But later on I took another ride in the back seat (left, inside) and the final raven turn was so jerky with the rotation that I bashed my head hard against the headrest 3-4 times in a row. Overall it wasn’t a fun ride after the amazing first drop. The rotation just seems to get worse the farther back you are in the train.  If I had skipped that second ride X2 would have been my favorite and would have cracked my top 10. 

Tatsu just verified for me that I’m just not cool with B&M flyers. It’s mainly the shin restraints. I think they just trigger some kind of claustrophobia for me - which is weird cause I’m not claustrophobic at all. 

Twisted Colossus was amazing that one lap that it actually dueled. But it was jerky, short, and terribly paced during the other 7 laps. And those two laps where the station train managed to pass the 1/2 way train on the lift really hurt my head, my feelings, and my soul. 

Superman though?  I wasn’t expecting anything from the ride, and it ducking blew me away. Full Throttle I was expecting to like a lot, but it ended up being so much more fun than I had expected.  And even as a verified stand-up apologist, Riddler genuinely surprised me with how great it was. 

The rest of the coasters were pretty good for the most part. Viper really only for some GASM nostalgia; but ninja, revolution, the mine train, the big mine train (goliath burn), pretty much everything except for Scream was really very good."
I was looking at the XM3 earlier today for cost reasons and it seems the XM4 is not that much better. https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-vs-sony-wh-1000xm3-38479/

"Pineapple juice is THE best mixer, especially when you’re drinking at home. In our cheap college days my boyfriend would buy the biggest, cheapest handle of spiced rum and then giant cans of pineapple juice and just mix those. You couldn’t even taste the alcohol and we drank way too much for way too long off just $10-$15"
