Should also get a look from anyone who likes the zero-based-budgeting of YNAB but needs a free DIY alternative. It is all Google Sheets so anyone familiar with working on spreadsheets can customize it for their unique situation."
"Integrity.

Lol, jk, money. You need money."
Broad church is really good. There is also another British crime show called Marcella that‚Äôs great and she deals with some of the ‚Äúidentity disorder‚Äù type storyline as well.
"You probably know this already, but you can manually enter transactions in the new YNAB too.  I've never connected with my bank, and still enter and reconcile every transaction manually."
"No, what I meant is the trees and the beautification. Cedar Point has no themeing I agree."
"I have found damn near every Linux distro clunky, even Ubuntu. I am quite comfortable with Linux, administering 300 or so as my day job. Obviously the server space is a bit different. Anyway..

Been looking for an alternative to Windows for a while and Manjaro started popping up quite a bit. So, just over month and a half ago I split my system partition and dual booted Manjaro. Basically played around for about 2 days, and man was I surprised at how refined and polished and functional it looks, feels and is.

Aftee the 2 day stint, I bought a new NVME drive, loaded up Manjaro, and now use it exclusively.

I could easily recommend Manjaro as a replacement to Windows and probably even Mac.

Been a breeze with KDE Plasma and I keep exploring and learning. Currently even running Machine Learning on my system along with Lutris and Steam.

Only weired behaviour is with games, specifically when Proton or Wine is involved.

I do believe that Manjaro is a damn good argument for why game devs should give Linux some love.

Very happy. For a moment I was ""missing"" Windows because of work setups, but quickly found out that my dumb ass misconfigured VPN and RDP bits and bobs and as soon as I fixed the settings, everything worked flawlessly.

Kudos to Manjaro, and I hope we can get it more mainstream."
It‚Äôs a hellhole with controller or without lmao

So what about browsers like brave and vivaldi?
haha Wow. That's so random. Once the lead singer of UnderOath jogged past my car and waved to my little sister. Strange how things happen.
"Jim Beam, honey. Straight and on the rocks."
"Maybe it's just me but is cologne really all that common in under 40s?

The only times I smell cologne is on older men.

The only time I am aware of men's smell is if they are clean (bath soap smell) or really dirty."
Probably Amy Sedaris. Or maybe Iman.
"Pantera's *Far Beyond Driven* is the greatest workout album of all time, I mean ""Strength Beyond Strength"", ""5 Minutes Alone"", ""Planet Caravan"", and ""Shedding Skin"" just to start with. Not one song made it?

Wait, not even one non-*FBD* Pantera song? Like ""A New Level"", ""Mouth For War"", or ""Revolution Is My Name""? What a horrible list."
"George Takei. Bumped into a little Asian guy in a white suit on my way out of a theater, he turns around and goes ""Oh myyy, I'm so sorry.""

Realized why the laughter from the front row had caught my attention."
"I'm a huge fan of Old Fashioned, a great cocktail that's perfect for an after work delight.

For the most bang/buck, get Rittenhouse Rye Whisky.  It's not bad and is high in alcohol content.

Play with the ratios to find what you like best:


Rye Whisky (I use about 2-3oz depending on mood)

Simple Syrup (Just get the cheap stuff at grocery store - .5-1oz)

Angostura Bitters (Can get at most grocery stores - a few drops)

Orange or Lemon Peel (I use a potato peeler to get a big chunk.  Wipe it on rim of glass and drop it into drink when done - you are really going for aroma more than anything.  I like about 1/6th of the peel/rind, my wife likes about half of the fruit's peel)

Give it a gentle stir over ice - sip and enjoy."
"$2600? Is that normal? I know a family in Olympia WA that got quotes of $1200 and $1500 for two rooms of about the same area as yours (LR/FR), for 9' walls and ceilings. The contractors will be moving and replacing everything.

My family (me, hubby, and teen) are repainting about half of our house. So it's not costing us *that* much! The paint, rollers, brushes, tape, and some extension poles aren't cheap but I can see it being the least expensive way to go. 

We're enjoying all the new colour (a change from the builder beige in our previous homes of the past few decades)."
"Vertigo, because it does more than just ‚Äûshock‚Äú.
It asks a question. Do we love people for who they are, or do we love them for what we see in them?"
except your use of lbs as a weight of measurement instead of kilograms... and using Fahrenheit vs Celsius... and miles vs kilometres. They don't make sense lmao
"I have thought neither long nor hard about this but here they are in no particular order :

Trigun
Cowboy bebop 
Steins gate
Haruhi
Excel saga
Soul eater

And for good measure the same list but for movies :

Akira
Perfect blue
My neighbor totoro 
Princess mononoke 
Escaflowne (though I probably could have put the show in the other list) 
Spriggan"
"They are incorrect, you were correct that USB-C operates at higher voltages (5V, 9V, 15V, or 20V) than USB-A (generally 5V only)."
There wasn‚Äôt before?
Good on you for not listening to that arsehole manager!. You helped a lot of people that day. You should be proud of yourself. üòÄ
