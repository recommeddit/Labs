I was taught about My Lai pretty extensively in one of my high school courses 5ish years ago so maybe things are changing for the better. Or maybe I was just lucky and it's still the norm not to teach it. Hopefully the former.
"Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Brett Favre, Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald, Rob Gronkowski, Emmitt Smith, Barry Sanders, Calvin Johnson, Jr., and last but not least: OP's lack of commas which gave me dyslexia."

"vim isn't the best editor:

>Of course, on the system I administrate, vi is symlinked to ed. Emacs has been replaced by a shell script which 1) Generates a syslog message at level LOG_EMERG; 2) reduces the user's disk quota by 100K; and 3) RUNS ED!!!!!!"
"I prefer having one pair at a time. Currently, I'm wearing polarized rectangle sunglasses from Chanel SS 2016. They're light and don't slide down my nose (hard to find, actually!). I've never lost a pair, and I plan to wear them for a while."

"If you're referring to Audible's DRM there are two facts you should consider:

* The Audible DRM was broken years ago.

* Audible permits creating CDs of the audiobooks.

I understand the desire to hold on to certain audiobooks because you may want to listen to them again. Good news: Audible never deletes purchased audiobboks from your library so you can always re download."

"Last of the Mohicans is a great adventure film, and an almost perfect movie. And now I'll be whistling that third act theme all afternoon."
I like Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-B). Cheaper than XOM and CVX.
"I bought my wife a Wacor Mewatec. We're very happy with it, German technology.

I bought myself a Chinese one, Hibbent non-electric and installed an inline thermostat: https://www.hibbent.com/collections/bidet-seat"
I got through about 20 minutes. Haha. The next 10 minutes aren't any better.
I suggest you look into making a [food forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_gardening). It'll take a few years to get it going but once you do you'll be growing a lot of food for a long time. Money saved on your food costs for years adds up to a lot and you could definitely sell/give away extra from 20-30 acres. You could just start with 5 and keep growing.
"Same here, donâ€™t get me wrong, I love my major, but I think studying the universe would be cool too."
"**Scrambles** are a great way to use up leftovers:

1. Any kind of leftover potatoes: French fries, hash browns, tots, home fries, etc.

2. Whatever leftover veggies I have laying around: diced onion, bell pepper, peas, green onion, shallots, etc.

3. Whatever leftover meat I have laying around: breakfast sausage, bacon, ham, turkey, chicken, etc.

4. Whatever leftover cheese I have laying around: cheddar, Monterey Jack, gruyÃ¨re, meunster, etc.

5. Two eggs over easy.

Preparation is just:

1. Heat up the potatoes.
2. SautÃ©e the veggies (unless it's peas).
3. Heat up the meat.
4. Toss it all in a bowl and add shredded cheese.
5. Season and fry the eggs and toss them on top."
I jumped in lodi 3 days ago.  We all wore seatbelts.  I did AFF there 5-6 years ago.  Guess what? I wore a seatbelt.  Nice job being an uninformed keyboard warrior though...
"Kim or Khloe actually

I dont like Kourtney at all

"I, too, am a Brown key proponent.  I do a lot of typing in addition to gaming; I found Reds to be too soft for typing purposes and Blues to be much too stiff for gaming.  Browns are just right.

But it's up to you.  If possible, get some sample keys and test for yourself.  If you do any amount of typing, I personally wouldn't recommend Red switches, and if you do go that route I'd recommend having a dedicated typing keyboard on the side."
"Awesome post, for me the little guy I like what you explained in your post. I have a ryzen 5 1600af with a 1650 super. Play on 32 inch curved 1080 60hz and unless I start upgrading my tower I don't see a reason to switch to 2k or 4k. Or up my hz. Thankful for this post. (Apex legends, ff14, and raid shadow legends)
Good luck and have fun!"
So does your comforter just live on the floor?  Or did you actually put it away and they just don't make up the bed with it anymore?

"That's understandable! I think the prestige and status that comes with a Tesla Model 3 is really appealing to me in addition to the high-tech innovation. It just seems like it's cutting edge.

But this post has definitely opened my eyes to some good alternatives worth considering."
"I have always liked Rockets (I understand they are called Smarties in the US?).

Basically sugar disks, but whatever."
If you could only learn one I would say the guitar. You can do so much more with it than with a piano.
