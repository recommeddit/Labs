36168,best alcoholic drink,"Not a bar tender, but my cousin taught me this, and he's from New Jersey so he knows a thing or two about drinking.

The peppermint patty:

1. Take a swig of peppermint schnapps straight from the bottle.  Don't swallow it yet!
2. Squirt some chocolate syrup directly into your mouth.  Try not to miss, especially if you're wearing a suit on your way to a wedding.
3. Shake your head vigorously to mix, then swallow.

Stay classy NJ."

58911,best perfume,"Depending on where you’re from, the dominant culture may not be used to men wearing fragrance, so I feel like that has something to do with it"
52132,best iphone case,Really loving my simple [Incipio](http://www.amazon.com/Incipio-NGP%C2%AE-iPhone-6-Black/dp/B00MHWSNR6) - it's the top rated pick from The Wirecutter.  Had one for my 4S for almost three years and looked new and have been using one for my 6 for six months now with no complaints.
17756,best Kardashian,"that was really fucked up and childish, but to be fair it was indeed in retaliation to Chloe slut shaming. Chloe Moritz has a long history of being very weird and misogynistic and slut shamey so its understandable that Khloe would share that as being hypocritical."
16960,best iOS game,"Strictly iOS gamer here, my absolute favorite games are:

Civilization 6: I love strategy games and this is the best in my opinion

Northgard: Just started played this one and I’m already hooked, Strategy/Management game

XCOM 2 Collection: Console quality strategy game, amazing depth and graphics 

Six Ages: Create your own story game, please try this game if you like complex strategy games, I bet you’ll love it 

Dead Cell: Rogue-Like strategy game, one of the best dungeon crawlers ever made. 

KOTOR 2: I’m so glad they ported this to iOS, haven’t finished but it’s amazing so far."

42849,best detective show,I'm so on board with this list - agree 100%. The jinx was so insanely good I actually binge watched the whole series in one sitting on two separate occasions. The twists are unreal!

9599,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Santa Rosa for best showers (if you're looking for Chi-5 and don't mind communal). Good water pressure, warm enough for the winter. Lounges are nice and clean with tidy kitchenettes on the side. Mini gym on 2200s wing. Closest chi-5 dorm to classes, so super convenient rushing to classes when you're short on time, especially for those that walk or skate.
Santa Cruz for nicer rec room + theater ( you don't have to live there to rent it out tho!), but water pressure sucks and the first floor lounges are really small. Second floor lounges are more spacious with kitchenettes, but there are no towel dispensers in them for some reason. 
San nic can be nice if you don't mind elevators. Less walking to get to your room compared to navigating the shorties. Elevator wait can be really annoying and actually nip u in the arse when you have to rush somewhere. However, if you live on 1-3 floors, you probably won't be using the elevator much anyway. Showers are sad and dinky, but water pressure is decent. There are all-gender bathrooms on the first floor.
San Miguel's gym is nicer than Santa Rosa's, but you just need an e-key from any residence hall to access it. 
Manzi's lounges are really nice with better kitchens compared to chi-5. Personally, I think Carrillo has the best food consistently and interesting soft serve flavors. But often times, Ortega and dlg can impress with cool things.
Can't say much else. This is all I know from personal experience. Good luck!"

56582,best desktop monitor,"I have one 144hz and two 60hz and it work fine, sometimes my 144hz screen flashes and lag for a few seconds when alt-tabbing back in game but that might just be my monitor and it doesn't bother me much anyway."

61783,Best RPG game on PS4,TIL. Thank you!
56750,best desktop monitor,"It's just a matter of trial and error. I kept going til my monitor black screened @80Hz and waited til the display reverted to the last stable state. The only thing to look for when overclocking your monitor to see if it's successful is to move around the mouse cursor.  

Is the mouse skipping frames? Stop there and go back 2Hz unless it wont go over 60/62Hz without it skipping frames.  
  
Is it still smooth? Keep going til frame skips are noticeable or screen goes black."
64298,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"""Booktitle"" and ""audio book"" in Google almost always provides. Unless you live in Sweden like me, where many titles are regionally blocked, hence I end up at the audiobookbay."
