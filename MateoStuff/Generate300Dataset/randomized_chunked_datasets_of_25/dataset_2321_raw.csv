"It was awesome.  Never broke bones behind the truck.  I did go off a 13 foot cliff in a sled and that broke my collar bone.  Another fun thing to do is get a cheap canoe, tie it behind the truck, and use it as a sled through the fields.  Just don't fall out..."

But I got my mom three tickets to see the Trans Siberian Orchestra. She loves music

Last year I got her ugg boots, because her feet are always cold 

Year before I got her accessories for her new iPad. 
  
Pick something thoughtful. Notice her likes and go off of them! Good luck :)"
Lots of other great advice to shop where the service is good and you get the prices and products you like BUT as a general rule this works.
"It's warm at the moment in Ontario, but we had a cold snap in early October. That's when I learned my downstairs neighbours will take care of my heating bill for me this winter I guess.

I had to open windows too, and I sweat when I went downstairs to do some laundry."

"> International affairs is kinda known as the ironic killer of dreams for moving abroad

I'd be curious to know more about what you mean by this. I mean I've definitely been worried about outcomes but I'd be curious to hear more about what you actually know, if that makes sense? From what I've read really the only careers guaranteed to be workable abroad are in tech, medicine, or sometimes the trades, and it's hard to get a feel if International Affairs is significantly worse than other possibilities outside of that or not.

Regarding pay, I think some countries (Switzerland and Australia, for example) pay around what the U.S. pays. However, in the U.S. everyone works more than 40 hours a week and vacation isn't guaranteed. I'm tired of making money without being able to really spend it on lots of travel and leisure time, if that makes sense?"
jujutsu kaisen is one of the worst if not the worst anime I've ever seen. the ONLY thing good is the animation style lol besides that it has the most dog aids story I've ever watched. Overpowered characters everywhere with no explanation except eating an old finger. that show blew chunks

">They put a lot of effort into this one to really make it feel like you're submerged in a kind of futuristic world. Thanks for posting this.

That's not asmr in itself though. Asmr is triggered by sound or visuals. It has nothing to do with being submerged in anything or cute girls infront of a video camera, although it can help for some. The personal attention you get from such videos can also be very relaxing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjhTbePvyXc is a good example of a random video being triggering."
