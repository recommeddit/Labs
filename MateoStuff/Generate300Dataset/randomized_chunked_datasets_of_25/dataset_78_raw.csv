Kentucky classic right there! (Makers and ale 8 in our family) but all versions are delicious!

"Departures. 2 buddies travel the world and film it.

Its awesome."
I know those guys were looking for such awards or lists. Unfortunately looks like language barrier didn’t allow it. They have a bunch of translated non-english SF books on the site though - https://www.worldswithoutend.com/rollyourown.asp?ryo_id=293. If you know of a consistently updated non-english list you should reach out to them - https://www.worldswithoutend.com/mbbs22/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=1724&posts=525&start=1.

"PS4. I like the exclusives a bit more. The controller feels a bit more comforting. Better free games of the month each month I feel like. To each it’s own though! 

Only con I find with the PS4 is that I’m American and I rarely ever run into Americans on PS4. Saying that, I need more friends so if anyone wants to add me, my user is tidaljunkee.

I own both but I find myself on the PS4 way more. I don’t have a Pro yet, but that’s fine! I’ll get it one day. Heard the Pro is a very big hit! I’m from Iowa, and the only Pro that is for sale last time I checked is literally 3 hours from my local metro store. Insanity."

Having anyone ahead of France is a joke.
"Meh. ""Treason"" is overselling it. He did something unsightly that wouldn't play well with the electorate, but the Logan Act is unenforceable and unconstitutional and there's no way he would have gone down for merely talking to a foreign leader. By that logic Tom Cotton would be in jail for his letter to Iran. He definitely could have lost the election."
"1. River City Ransom (NES)
2. Herzog Zwei (Genesis)
3. Goldeneye (N64)
4. FFVII (PS)
5. SSX3 (XBOX)

Had a hard time getting a #5.  Kind of fell off the console wagon around  the PS2/XBOX timeframe."
"Gotta admit I was wrong. I used to think Gloomhaven was overhyped and over recommended when compared to other similar games.

I just got Jaws of the Lion, and it honestly blew me away with how good it is. I get it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, and that’s fine, but I now understand why it’s so widely regarded and recommended. Kind of sad now I missed on on Frosthaven’s KS, but if I understand correctly, the preorder is still open :)"
tfw a dashcam is illegal in your country... for whatever fucking reason
"We just got convinced to subscribe to the best Amsterdam newspaper, 'The Parool'.

The reason is that they have the local reports about what is going on in Amsterdam. Especially good for an Expat like me.

They deliver the paper in the afternoon, so it actually makes sense to come home and read it. I like that."

"A ww2 era mosin nagant or an old single shot scattergun? If you felt like taking up hunting that is. A mosin might run you a *teensy* bit more but not hugely if you know where to look.

Alternatively, an [antique khukri from india](http://www.ima-usa.com/original-nepalese-gurkha-kukri-bhojpure-fighting-knife-unmarked.html)  

Maybe a special tool/kit that can help you do some DIY projects? 

Also, someone suggested charity earlier, this charity is badass. If that's your thing. It lets you empower people in underdeveloped countries by giving them goats,water buffalo, chickens and stuff like that for self sufficiency.

Funny and sad.
Yes that is fair!  I was just pointing out that it definitely didn't retail in the 1500-1800 range like was suggested.
Daniel Sloss has some pretty good stand ups but his jigsaw special really is a heavy hitter.
"For Node, is there any reason why we can't just use the native https and http agent modules? I think it's pretty complete, maintained by a fairly competent team, gives you the utility of any other http request dependency and is ""closer to the metal"" so to speak."
