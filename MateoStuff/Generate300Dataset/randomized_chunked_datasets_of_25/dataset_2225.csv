Ray Tracing is basically using the GPU to track how light bounces and actually simulate light, which allows for things like actual accurate reflections, better global illumination, etc. It's not currently widely supported, but it's highly likely it will become more and more supported as time goes on and the hardware to run it gets more powerful.",best midrange CPU
61388,"One thing that really surpirsed me about ys viii lod was how much I actually cared about the story and characters. A lot of jrpg fans talk about how well crafted the stories are and how great the characters are but 9 times outta 10 I end up finding jrpg stories naive at best and rarely surprise me or ever feel remotely close to having believable characters that feel ""real"". Everyone talked about how great the combat feels in ys, and they werent wrong, but the story wraps up on an amazingly bold and surprising way that was so refreshing (assuming you get the true ending).",Best RPG game on PS4

22444,"Met -- hung out with for an hour or so -- Kiefer Sutherland.

It was an amazing coincidence running into him as we had plans to go see him at his concert the coming Saturday night. (Tickets were free, but you had to stand in line to get 'em.)

My son was bartending -- I came in to see my son -- and he said, ""hey Dad, I got someone I want you to meet...""

So when I met him, the first thing out of my mouth was ""oh my goodness, we loved you in Lost Boys, in 24, in so much -- and believe it or not my wife and I are coming to see your band on Saturday!""

He LOST IT!!! He was like, ""most people don't have a clue about my music... I can't believe you guys are coming! That's so awesome...""

Yeah, he was thrilled....

So I called my wife? Then she swung by the bar too to meet Kiefer.

Long story short, he left really great seats for us at the will call.  Then during the concert he called out for my wife and me to stand up...then he dedicated a love song to us.

He's a good dude!!!",best celebrity
38677,"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news is all you need. It's pretty straight down the middle politically, and has a pretty damned comprehensive picture of what is happening. Admittedly, its comment pieces aren't brilliant, but for straight news it's excellent.

That, and The Economist. I'm such a huge fan of its wide coverage, even if I have to take its unblinking support of deregulation and privatisation with a bit of a pinch of salt. Its international coverage is second to none, and I really feel like I've learned so much about the world whilst being a subscriber.

Oh, and I'll hundred-and-second the support for Private Eye. Yes, it is mostly satire and taking the piss, but its news is fantastic, and it actually cares about exposing people in power. The sheer volume of nepotism and circular career moves of various people/departments is frankly terrifying.",best newspapers to read
52450,"Tons of people put people and albums they don't like in their top 5, top 10, whatever, to not piss off fanbases. They add Jay, Wayne, Ye, Em, Rakim, whatever to appease people and not get into huge arguments. Honestly, Ny State Of Mind, The World Is Yours, It Ain't Hard To Tell, and Memory Lane are the only tracks off Illmatic that I still even listen to. Sure, Illmatic influenced many artists, it's pretty good, but GOAT album? Idk.. It certainly set a very high bar in 94', but rap has evolved a lot in the 26-27 years since then. There are artists influenced by Illmatic and Nas himself and what he did on that album, but the X factors of it (wordplay, flows, storytelling) have been outdone by now AT TIMES with artists like Eminem, Lloyd Banks, The Game, Jay who were all influenced by Nas somewhat. Those were the early adopters. No doubt that Kanye, Kendrick, Cole etc or whatever were also influenced by him. I can't really have a GOAT or GOAT album in it really, it's always evolving.",best hiphop album

The vast majority is just watch him code and follow along. I personally hate that style of teaching. Because of this I’m stopping and switching over to Andrew Meads React course. I took his js bootcamp which was packed with code challenges.",Best online React course
39704,"Is it weird that each month that passes for me clean of cancer just gets me more and more excited that we’re getting closer and closer to finding subtle cures and better treatments here and there for the off chance I develop it at some point in my life? 

I’m 21, have never had any mental issues of any kind whatsoever, except I’ve had horrible health anxiety for the past couple years. Apparently I pulled a muscle clearing a bunch of brush for a neighbor over the winter and have had slight pain in the lower right oblique and I always have random uncomfortable moments when resting or sitting and my first thought is always cancer.  Doctor keeps telling me over and over that it’s a strained muscle and that it can often times take a long ass time to heal but I can never shake that fear. And this is only one example. I have random things all over me that just spark anxiety and I can’t stop it.",best podcast for biologists
