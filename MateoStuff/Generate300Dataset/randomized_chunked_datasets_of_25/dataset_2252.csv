69880,"Accountant here.

It is indeed a safe bet. While the job security is good, what's even better is that there's always tons of job openings for CPAs. The pay is decent, not amazing, but for most people it's going to get you a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. 

HOWEVER, the hours are very, very long. The vast majority of accountants work a ton of unpaid overtime, they come in just behind lawyers and doctors in terms of work hours, but on average, they also make a lot less than lawyers and doctors. 

Yes, the work is boring, really damn boring. In fact, I think that fact is key to the success of the profession. If this work wasn't so damn boring, people would just do it themselves and the wages in this profession would plummet. Because accounting isn't hard, there's a  lot of material to memorize at first, but it's not terribly difficult or complex. It's just time-consuming and boring to get through, and that's why accountants get paid what they do, because they're the people with the patience and tolerance for boredom to actually pay attention to the little details and technicalities.

On the plus side, accounting does at least get to dip their nose in everything. It doesn't require much math, but it takes a lot of professional writing to pump out memos, policies, reports, presentations, etc. You'll do a little project management to manage all the projects that inevitably pop up, particularly for system add-ons, integrations, and/or replacements. You'll need at least some familiarity with IT to get a sense for the company's ERP flows and ensuring we keep it all contained in a solid control environment. You'll chitchat with sales and departmental heads on how things are going with the business to help improve the accuracy of financial forecasts, etc. etc.

You'll also deal with some resentment though, because anytime you show your face, it means it's time to deal with some meaningless numbers bullshit that doesn't actually matter (at least not to them!), but you need to force those conversations anyway. Even after you're not doing audit anymore, accounting/finance people still get painted as the ""bad guy"" in a lot of these situations, so you also need people skills to try to ensure everybody feels like we're on the same team, and make sure that those annoyed people still get you the deliverables you need and respect your timelines. 

If you want to get a reliable fast-track to a successful career start in public accounting with the big 4. You will work OBSCENE hours, literally over 100+hours a week, for weeks on end, and you'll be paid less than what you'd make in private accounting. But you learn incredibly fast, and most companies will specify an expected # of years of public accounting experience for their open positions. Then when you finally leave public accounting for private accounting, you work much more reasonable hours and get paid a whole lot more. It IS possible to be promoted up from within private accounting, but it'll take longer to move up. Public accounting moves you up so quickly because if you're not promotion material, they'll fire you to make way for others (but most just leave of their own volition for better pay and hours). 

____________________________
**EDIT:** To expand on the demand for CPAs, after my initial applications to intern with a public accounting firm, I didn't have to send out resumes anymore. After working in public accounting, you WILL be headhunted constantly with recruiters trying to fill positions. You'll also have agencies trying to lure you away from your job, they'll show you a list of open jobs their clients have (the companies that are hiring), and then you tell them which ones they can show your resume to. The hiring company pays the agent a percentage of what your salary will be, so it's in the agent's interest to get you matched and for as much as possible. 

This means a ton of the job hunting is handled by someone else for free, plus those agents will also get same-day feedback from the hiring company after an interview, to find out whether or not they like you and why. For my last job change a year ago, of the 4 companies I allowed my agent to apply to, 3 wanted to interview, and I got 2 job offers plus a counter-offer from my current employer. I told the 3 companies what kind of competing offers I had and asked for their best and final bid and I simply took the highest.  (You can also skip the whole agency process and just apply to positions directly, and then the hiring company can apply the budget for agency fees towards giving you a bigger signing-bonus.)",best major to study in college
11109,"I hate to plug LL Bean, but it's the only book bag that's actually held up for me. My brother, sister and I all had multiple Eddie Bauer backpacks, but they didn't make it past a couple of years each. My messenger bags and other backpacks (Adidas, Swiss, and a couple others) all tore up in less than a year... I seriously went through 5 bags in two years before caving in and getting the LL Bean.

My sister and I now both have LL Bean backpacks that have been going strong for 7 or 8 years of VERY heavy use throughout high school, college, and grad school. For me, 5 of those years were spent carrying my MacBook, and there are no real signs of wear. My sister now carries her MBP in hers and it's holding up well, too.
