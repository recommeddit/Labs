I have a similar response - I don’t wear it anymore but the most compliments I ever received from men was when I wore VS’s “Very Sexy” spray or perfume. They must have figured pheromones out!

Ritz Carlton in Singapore for the service. The hotel staff overhead I liked music and bought me a cute guitar lesson set and hand made a toy ukelele with my name glued onto it.
"I like Quip. It's battery powered with a two minute timer (although not as intense as a sonicare) and I get a new brush head, battery, and toothpaste in the mail every 3 months for ten bucks.

I'm glad you said manual is fine bc my toothbrush doesn't do much for the battery power, but I really like not thinking about it until I get my little package in the mail lol"
That made me cry even more!!  I'm going down to help with my grandbabies on Thursday.  My daughter is having surgery so she won't be able to hoick their 18 lb 7 month old hulk baby around for a few days.  The 3 yo just wants cuddles and daddy just can't deal with both at the same time lol.
"As a high school student who just took AP US History last year, I feel qualified to answer the second part of your question. 

As part of our studies of American ""Manifest Destiny"" sentiment and pre-Civil War state relations, we studied the Mexican-American War in some detail (or at least the political side of it). If you are unfamiliar with AP, they are a series of tests offered by the College Board to High School students and a high score on a test can often earn you college credit in a comparable area of study. As you can imagine, there is much more rigor in these classes than there would be in a standard high school US History class and this deters many students from taking the AP version. It is my understanding that the standard US History class at my school did not go over the Mexican-American War at all since they start their studies in the Reconstruction (Post-Civil War, 1870's-ish) era.

As for your main question:

The gist of what we learned is that the War was deliberately started by the Americans. Reasons being:

* The 1844 election of the Pro-Manifest Destiny and Pro-expansionary Polk led sitting President John Tyler to believe that there was a popular referendum in support of these goals and annexed Texas accordingly

* Annexing Texas would inevitably lead to conflict with Mexico since Mexico still maintained that Texas was Mexican territory despite the Texans having claimed independence for many years

* President Polk himself initiated a causus belli for the war in a Congressional Report that stated Mexican Soldiers had attacked American Soldiers on *American soil*. The Spot Resolutions of Abraham Lincoln, who was at the time a Representative from Illinois, challenged the claim and vehemently demanded to know the exact *spot* where the attack supposedly occurred. There is now strong reason to believe that Lincoln was correct (the attacks appear to have happened on disputed territory) and that Polk was deliberately attempting (successfully) to provoke anti-Mexican sentiment

* Polk, who was a true Son of the South, had great reason to pursue expansion and definitive annexation of Texas (both of which would be outcomes of the War, which we had little reason to believe we would lose). It was around this time that true tension between free and slave states was beginning because the tentative balance of power between them was being tested. This power was measured by the number of states in each category, since more states meant more votes in the all-important House of Representatives. This count was becoming dangerously close. If Texas, a would-be slave state, were admitted to the Union then power would be back in the hands of the slave states. Polk and his followers also believed that many of the other territories gained from the War would follow suit. 

Even though things did not work out *exactly* as planned (Texas and the New Mexico Territory voted to become a slave territory but California and the Utah Territory did not), the actions of the Southern Political Establishment, including Federal officeholders, after the War make it clear this was their main, if not only, goal. 

I do not know much about Mexican history, but taking all this into account, I find it hard to believe that it would be the Mexicans who are to blame for starting the War.

All of the beautiful scenery, relaxation, beautiful beaches, delicious food, nice people and fun activities that you would want on a vacation and none if the third world crime BS that you shouldn't have to deal with on a vacation.  I live 200 miles from the Mexican border and instead fly 2500 miles to Maui every summer."

I didn't tell dude not to go. I merely suggested he not use the word real when describing such a trip."

You can try the TestFlight for [DAS Budget](https://testflight.apple.com/join/NHvmLiD3). I’ve seen some people really like this one.
I'd get a CS degree with significant coursework in quantitative finance.

I keep seeing these get recs but I can't get over the name...it just sounds so cheesy.  But i haven't seen anyone pan them so I guess I should get over it.
