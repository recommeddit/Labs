Buy a bottle of Caribbean 151/Puncheon, like Forres Park. Usually its cheap, like 20$ but its like 70 sumtin + percent alcohol. Mix it with strong fruit juices or whatever... The thing is because its stronger you use less, so you have to use more juice to fill the cup. It also doesn't seem to smell much or carry a strong flavor like dark rums. 

Seriously tho.. Puncheon is notorious down in the west indies for fkin pple up lol.",best alcoholic drink

34262,"I agree with you and PFF on that 100%! 

They (Steve Palazolo & Sam Monson) did a great job discussing this topic on one of their recent podcasts. I forgot which player they were discussing, but basically over a 3-year period the pass rush win rating for this guy was in the mid 60s (something like 62; 66; 64), but during that period his sack numbers were something like 3, 8, 2. So essentially, even though the player had steady pass rush performance it did not reliably predict the likelihood of a sack. I agree with them, there is too much variability in what happens after a pass rush win (i.e. QB throws ball away, rolls out, scrambles, slides into another rusher who gets the sack, etc.) that makes using sacks as the end all be all stat for pass rushing misguided at best.",best NFL player

47416,"If you're into nature, head for the National Parks or natural sights. Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountains, Yosemite, etc. The Great Lakes are my personal favorite. 

New York City is pretty rad if you do the fun stuff: Central Park, Broadway, Statue of Liberty, etc. The pizza is amazing.

Head north if you want to eat the best cheese in the world. Napa, California for wine. The midwest for beer. 

Head south if you want spicy/meaty food. Texas, New Orleans, etc. 

Vegas is fun for like a day and then it gets boring unless you have a lot of money to blow on gambling and drinking. 

The Northwest (Washington state) if you wanna see some of the most beautiful pine forests in the world.

Yosemite is pretty cool. Went there a few years ago. Mountains everywhere, swimming in pools under waterfalls, the Redwood Trees are freaking incredible.",best state to visit in the United States
