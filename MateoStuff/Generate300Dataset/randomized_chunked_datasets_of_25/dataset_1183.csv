68046,"I can't express my admiration enough for Well's ""The War of the Worlds""

It has remained my favorite book since I first read it when I was 9-10 years old.  

There's just so much cool stuff about it.

Wells' criticism of colonial imperialism.

Wells describing the martians as utterly repulsive, and then suggests that's where human evolution is going.

His ability to recognize what happens when societal standards break down.

His take on religion and how it helps/hinders in the direst of times and what a terrible crutch it turns out to be.

The ACTION SEQUENCE of the Thunderchild!

The way Wells describes how the martian machines are graceful, almost animistic in their movements thanks to the ""muscles"" they employed and the concept of the martians not utilizing the wheel.

The narrative is never boring.  And the language.   When Wells uses the phrase ""gaunt quiet"" to describe a soundless London....it's utterly perfect.

Appreciation of the novel is heightened if you have a knowledge of what were the scientific viewpoints of the day and how Wells integrated them into his work.   Especially in regards to evolution.    

Still waiting for someone to do a decent and faithful interpretation of the novel.   I think if done properly, modern audiences could relate to the themes raised in the story.   Hell, how many Jane Austin fans are there around?",best science fiction novel
