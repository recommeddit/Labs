Olympic National Park is right up there with one of my favorite places in the entire country.
"Taxes are pretty high, but stuff like doctors and education is free. Actually if you are over 18 years old you get money if you are studying. Also I think it is law to hate Sweden"
Boys support boys 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I do get your point— still this package mostly wraps fetch and node-fetch primarily for server rendered pages like Next.js. Fetch is in the browser and node fetch is actively maintained.

"I would be willing to pay £2,000 if it were worth it and it would last :)"
"By successful, I mean people have been able to post pretty respectable times. I'm not trying to say that they're great track cars. I just think it's unfair to call them ""one trick ponies"" that only accelerate to 60mph well. Especially when you consider their results.


That said, many of the problems you listed have pretty simple solutions. MPP sells camber bolts, tires can be upgraded,and Track mode tones down most nannies and makes the car less prone to understeer while also improving cooling and lap times."

Just stick with Zebra. I rarely have issues with it.
"If you wanna be super cute about it, cut some big letters out of stiff construction paper ""DAD"" and take three photos of kid + letters. Then put them in a three-part frame for dad's desk."

"Thanks, man. I really hope so."
"I never understood why this was such a sticking point for folks. It's different but hardly changes the big picture, in my opinion"
"[Wm. A. Kilian Hardware Co.](http://kilianhardware.com/)

I have an 1886 Victorian house with original double-hung weight and chain (instead of rope) windows and this place has all the tools and hardware that I've needed to restore them to their original glory."

"None of them. They're all impossibly biased garbage. That being said, the Associated Press can reliably be counted on to at least report on everything that happens, instead of only covering events that they can twist to make their chosen side look good. Their articles are still often riddled with bias, but it's far lesser than you'd get out of tabloids like the Washington Post or CNN."
"My SO worked for a fancy hotel. The building owners (not the chain, the actual building itself) came to visit. He was on the Forbes billionaire list. 

He was a nice man who had buffet lunches everyday and tipped every staff members he saw a crisp $100, every time he saw them. 

House keeper walking past? $100. Bar tender setting up? $100 

Shift swap? 100 on the way in and out."
