"Thanks for repping CONCACAF!  I know we have a rivalry, but one of us in the top 10 helps the region still."
"Common mistake. If you slowly move the brush over your teeth and let it do all the work it will do wonders. (think of it as mowing a tiny lawn) Since I started using an electric toothbrush 10 years ago I have had zero cavities and the hygienist always complements me on my brushing and flossing.

I never fucking floss.


**EDIT:** jeebus, 332 upvotes for *this*? Clarifications/answers - I have an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush. I do floss when there is shit stuck between my teeth or I think I need to. I am nearly 50 years old. Also regarding the heredity comment - yes! My wife's family has teeth like fucking diamonds and they do not know what a cavity is. Mine are like balsa wood in comparison."

"I’m really happy to see you mention Moonfall. Great book that doesn’t seem to get mentioned much. I agree with the person above who said ask me again in a week and you may get a different answer but here goes:

The Stand by Stephen King

The Martian by Andy Weir

Memory by Lois McMaster Bujold"
such a good soundtrack also
Um no it might be the biggest but Bay Beach is way better.
"And you think thats reasonable enough to be first? Im sorry but I don't think other national teams think ""oh shit we're playing against the number 1 national team"" when going against Belgium. Superb team nonetheless."
Santa Barbara is now a better school than San Diego? Interesting. I always viewed UCSD as having a solid grip on their 3rd place in the UC rankings.

Competitvely sure. Is there still a gen 1 competitive scene? Otherwise just beat the few psychic types in the game with whatever you like. I rarely had issues with Sabrina.

"Yeah, former dept managers had to apply to become area (it might be zone managers) managers and have about 5 dept under their supervision (and those that didn’t get the positions were fired) All installed sales, HR management and similar positions were eliminated and they got a customer service line in some state that takes all calls and deals with installations and complaints. 

And then again, some of the people have been there way too long and have had to deal with customers that make you wish you could drink some bleach for breakfast."
"There is an internationally voted poll in response to the NHK list done by an anime youtuber, and I think that list looks more fairer than NHK one.

Its shonen heavy at the top, but you can't deny that there is a group of people who only watch shonen anime or highly rate shonen anime."

"Honkai Impact 3rd has awesome graphics and gameplay and combat system, if you like anime style RPG is a very good game."
"I see WRPGs , I upvote."
"I'm in comp sci and I sort of wish I went into **Geology**. I'm in my junior year, and I did the math and it would still be possible for me to switch majors and finish on time (while picking up a minor in CS from the courses I've already taken). I'd have to switch now, though, and I've taken too many of the hard CS classes to justify it.

I'd love to be a ""proper"" natural scientist.

Maybe a psych or philosophy minor as well. I'm not too torn up with CS, though, since I'm almost finished and it can open up even non-tech-related doors."

"Another one for tap water, from the Netherlands. We actually have higher standards for tap water than for bottled water. And for some regions, the origin of tap water is the same as some of the bottled waters."
"The problem isn't them opening your checked bag. It's someone in a back room opening your checked valuables and then your suitcase shows up ""unopened"" but without your stuff.

Edit: I can't read that's exactly what you said."
