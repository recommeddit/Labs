Run This Town by Rihanna feat. Jay-Z and Kanye
"If you’re up for it Broad St Oyster Co is in the funk zone on weekends in front of Muni Wine. I haven’t been there yet, but I’ve heard it’s amazing. 
Little Door has good appetizers. 
Brophy’s for garlic baked clams."
Which one is the best?  Asking for a friend
I wasn't really taught too much about it in school. Vaguely remember Mexicans killed Davey Crockett at the Alamo. Mostly seemed like it was Indians in the west so pioneers came over and settled it peacefully.
OH LORD REEKRIS

As far as a GOAT, consensus has circulated around the iPhone 4 for like 6 years. I never owned one but I’m inclined to agree."
"I read this comment out to my mother and she laughed in my face. ""A dinner with dad and your brother wouldn't hurt, would it?""

Love her."
"It's a bit of a stretch and I haven't recently re-watched but basically:

>!You never actually see the cloning machine work. The argument is that he killed off his look alike for real the time he noticed the other guy in the crowd, and everything else is misdirection. You see the multiple hats (something not hard to get a lot of) but never the machine actually working in the same shot. Basically the cloning machine is an extension of the 'light show' of the machine from earlier in the film (lots of fancy effects and then have someone walk out of a different room having been ""teleported""). Plus the flashback shown in the last confrontation isn't set up as a regular flashback, but rather a retelling from an unreliable narrator. And in that hallway you only ever see the one dead man in the tank, when it would have been trivial to show the 'others' to remove doubt.!<

>!In a movie that's explicitly telling you to not fall for the trick and be critical of what's presented to you, it all feels a little suspicious; especially with how they're deliberately not showing you things that would make it absolutely clear. Do you believe the final trick is a literal 1:1 with the birds shown earlier, or that the final trick is being pulled on the audience? (I don't remember exact scenes, but at the time these both made about equal thematic sense)!<

>!And while in the book cloning is actually 100% shown to work, the movie never takes it that far while having a much more grounded story for the first 99% of the run time.!<

>!Basically the whole thing is just that a Nolan movie has an arguably open ended conclusion (\*shocker\*)!<"

Not surprised SFFT is more popular than SFOT. Biased bc SFFT is my home park but still.
"Not important.

Linkedin is kinda useful for collecting recruiter contacts. I did once get a contracting job through a facebook conversation, but that was more because I’d helped my friend run a hackathon in uni and he happened to need help with his startup."
"No, the point is that one does *not* want to install the OS. It's better in some cases to have a clean new system."

"I had the 1st gen SE as well until a couple months ago, got a bit over 4 years out if it which Is pretty good haha just upgraded to the 12 mini and I love it, I hate how big phones are nowadays so when I saw the 12 mini was announced, I knew that was going to be my next phone. As far as longevity goes, getting one of the newer models with the latest hardware should allow your phone to function as long as possible before any issues. I would also suggest that after about 2 1/2 years maybe 3 that you no longer update your iPhone. After a few years those updates can really slow down your phone and make it nearly unusable"
"Love again by run the jewels and some riot tren when I need the pick up. 

Slow jazz to cook and meal prep.

My favorite breakfast is pizza. I'll put some breakfast sausage on it and reheat one of last night's slices that didn't sell.

"I had to read that at least three times.  I kept picturing a painted, full-sized lawnmower sitting on a dresser and wondering...how."
That =3 confused me a little.
Thanks for your reply! I actually prefer LCD over OLED as it uses less power and it doesn't have burning risk like OLED.
