"A BEV is a non-starter for me, so a PHEV or EREV would be the best choice for me.  I'm not alone in this either.

Additionally, they will help solve the ""chicken or egg"" scenario with BEVs and chargers.  People don't want to buy BEVs without good charging infrastructure.  People don't want to build charging infrastructure without BEVs.

"Like most here, PC is by far my main platform. I do have a PS4 and a Switch as well.

In the last 12 months I have bought 1 PS4 game and 1 Switch game. I will likely be getting Mario Golf as well, but that will be all the console games.

Where as my PC I have bought 10+ games easily in 2021. 

As for Resident Evil, I just finished it on PC. Ultrawide, custom FOV, and much cheaper than buying on console."
