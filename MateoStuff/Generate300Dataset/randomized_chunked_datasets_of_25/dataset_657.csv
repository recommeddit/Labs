CSS3 is a CSS Level. Basically CSS comes in levels which should be implemented incrementally, that means CSS1 stuff is more well supported than CSS2 stuff, and so on.

For example, CSS1 has the features to change the background and the text color, CSS3 has text shadow, box shadow and transitions, CSS4 will let you set the text direction(top-down THEN right-left for example) which can be used by non-latin languages, such as Japanese, to render more native-like text.",best programming language for web development

27000,"Something I learned quickly when first trying to do this is raw ratings never work. They always give you bizarre results cuz niche and lifestyle games rocket to the top of the list. And that's not what you want. You want a list that can at least kinda/sorta be generalized to folks in the sub who didn't vote. 

The second thing I leaned is there isn't actually one, agreed upon statistical way to handle this problem. Other than insaneballs Bayesian averaging that I am not trained to do.

Most people play with a lot of hard-coded values with thresholds and dummy votes until they get something that seems to work well enough. Imdb and BGG both take this approach so, I figure I'm in good company. But the number of dummy votes and the value of said dummy vote is dynamic based on the data I get, so I'm at least trying to avoid arbitrary decisions.

**tl:dr** no, the # of dummy votes is based on the size of the guild",best board games
