26319,best politician,"[The Senate's list of great senators is a good starting place if you're looking for non-presidents that still had a big impact on history.](http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2016/Info/greatest-senators.html) If you want to understand the South then you've got to know Huey Long (who you mentioned) and George Wallace. Chicago's got a long history of colorful politicians, too, like Richard Daley."

22716,best celebrity,"Jerry Seinfeld: I played basketball in college and on road games our team actually was in the same hotel as him a few times. First time we were all sitting in the lobby waiting for the SID to finish checking us in and he came walking through. Being college kids were surprised and all just kind of staring, he looked right at us and I kid you not said ""Unbelievable, I'm in a hotel with a bunch of f*cking dumbass jocks"" then just kept walking shaking his head. Ok, well maybe we thought he was just trying some insult humor on us. Then 3 weeks later we were in the lobby of a hotel (same hotel chain different state) waiting for our bus to arrive to take us to shoot around that morning. He comes walking off the elevator with a plate in his hand. He marches straight to the front desk slams the plate down and begins to give the poor lady the riot act about how his eggs are not ""over easy"" and he rants on and on for at least 2-3 minutes. He looks over at us and not sure if he remembered us or not but when looked at us he stopped and goes ""you gotta be f*cking kidding me"". We all just lost it while he walked off and immediately got on his phone and started yelling at someone to stop booking him at the ""F*cking Hyatt"" but he is definitely an asshole in my book. *Sorry for any grammar or format issues, typing on my phone.*"
40172,best midrange CPU,"If you overclock yourself: Ryzen 5 2600

If you would rather have the system deal with it: Ryzen 5 2600x


> The 2600x also looks like a good deal but would it play many games with a 1070ti?

yes."
58750,best cologne,"Well, I personally think there's never a right way to wear cologne. As long as you don't offend anyone, don't overspray, fit in the situation, and like the cologne yourself, then you're good"

67248,axios alternatives reddit,"I understand that and we’re really just pedantically arguing about what constitutes an error.

I would argue that making a call that results in a 404 is an error. You should never make that call, so when it comes back 404 you know that something in your application sent a faulty request. Maybe your state is jacked and your passing bad ids. Maybe you’ve accidentally got a config string wrong. Regardless the error is on your end.

You are arguing that because fetch did not produce a breaking JavaScript error, it shouldn’t throw.

They’re just different philosophies for what “error” means. I am treating 404 as unexpected and thus I want an error. You are treating it as expected and thus want to handle it in normal flow."
