"There are major differences between shades of white. Cheap paint doesn’t hold up as well no matter how much prep you do. On a ceiling or something that never gets touched, fine. In a high traffic area, not so much."
"Yeah, other than Cmp% the most reliable thing year to year is PFF grade, you can argue there's some autocorrelation going on in QBs they just like, but I do think it says something about subjective views of QB play being very valuable."
