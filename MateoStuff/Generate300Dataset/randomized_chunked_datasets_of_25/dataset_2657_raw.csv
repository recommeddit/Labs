I get my dad that every year!
"Yes, Planet of the Apes as long as you haven't seen any promo poster of the freaking cover to the DVD. Nobody wants to ruin a great twist more than the producers of that movie."
"We have a really great local chain that has enough weight to have everything you might need in stock, or easily delivered from their distribution center, while retaining the small mom and pop customer service. They employ contractors, tradesmen and experienced handymen as managers who are reaching retirement in-charge of kids in or just leaving high school who get assigned to a department and only work there or at checkstands. They are awesome, sometimes a little more expensive depending on the item but they make up for it in staff.

McLendon Hardware, what would I do without you?"
"Or get it on Sci-hub for free, like every academic I know."
I have a pair of polarized Ray Ban wayfarers (purchased from Ray Ban directly). How can I tell if they also have UV protection?
I had never heard of this guy and those stand up specials are fucking hilarious.
"In this sub, I have encountered some resistance to the comic book medium. Surprisingly, as I would have thought readers of sci-fi to be more receptive to marginalised media.

Orbiter is also a great SF story of his. Ellis' obsession with spaceflight really shines here.

Grant Morrison would get a mention here too. but then my list would have to also include, Brian K Vaughn and Jeff Lemire and so on..."
"> Verizon gives me so many problems in the mountains

Wait til you try to find some other coverage in the mountains. In a lot of remote places, Verizon is the only option."
"Not dicks: Penn and Teller, Teller was ULTRA nice while signing autographs and taking pictures after the show. Penn didn't seem like he was in a good mood that night but dutifully took pictures with everyone. Penn is also SCARY huge. I wouldn't want to be on his bad side. 

Protip: Penn and Teller sign autographs and take pictures with everyone after the show."
yea it's basically everything about your experience.  I just fucking lol at some of the 3090 at 1080p comments on here.  So you spend all this money to play on a shit tier monitor?
"Were you trying a tampon with an applicator? 

I would recommend getting comfortable with a tampon first before trying a menstrual cup; I've used a cup for 7 years or so and I still find it a bit awkward at times."
How is he gonna go to the store and see what jumps out at him if he doesn't have a sense of smell!?
South Africa were the most successful side in both tests and ODIs in that decade.
This can be proven by sticking a fan in their room at night.
"I don't floss, should I be concerned?

Edit: so, I should be concerned."
"Pffft come to ""my"" house, built in the late 70s... 

All Rooms: ""Burnt orange wood paneling: Stimulates feelings of regret and general financial irresponsibility that led you to move back in with your parents four years ago.""

Complementary colors: ""Puke yellow (sofa), reddish brown (shag carpets), olive green (afghan throw pillows).""

As an aside, my dad's master bathroom is entirely, 100% yellow. Yellow shower, toilet, sink, walls, floor, counters, even the shit is yellow."
"Are these the first cords you broke so fast, or is this your common experience?"
This is really stupid. You could just as easily post a graph that compares someone's motivation and intelligence to their salary. The only reason those majors are at the bottom is because dumb and lazy people join in because they think they can make a quick buck without any work.
"I mean it has lots of those ""party games"" than nobody cares, the third party games (the multiplatforms that are available in all consoles) like doom, wwe, nba, fifa, are the worst of all the versions available due the weak hardware and run mostly at HD resolution or even lower which is unacceptable in 2018"
"F15 with 11300h and 3060

used Amd laptop only comes with 2060 at best and I'm using 1440p screen so I wanna get something more powerful. 
Also the newer 5000 series laptop haven't arrive in my country yet."
"I wear Aventus to work daily, we have 100's of customers a day and I rarely go a shift without somebody making a comment. I've never received a negative comment, people I'm familiar with will often say ' I thought I could smell you ', or ' I knew you were here before I saw you '. But they always explain that it's a good thing even though I smirk and laugh. Green Irish Tweed also gets comments but somebody did once call me out for overspraying it. I've not had any success with any of the others I've owned."
