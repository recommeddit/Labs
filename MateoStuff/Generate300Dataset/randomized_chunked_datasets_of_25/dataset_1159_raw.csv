"If you've never played it before, Skyrim is a great RPG that really set a new standard for the genre. I think its pretty cheap these days too!"
I love that One Piece is the ONLY one on the list still going!!! GODA!!!
"I always hated the argument ""i dosent stand well alone"" . It's not meant to!"
A bowl of super spicy Pho. Or a spicy plate of Pad Thai.

"If you're torn between Santa Cruz and Anacapa, here's some stuff to consider. Santa Cruz was recently renovated, and everything is brand new. It also has a movie theatre that is available to all residents, where you can borrow movies from the front desk or attach a laptop or an Xbox with an HDMI cable. Santa Cruz is also right next to DLG, the best dining commons on campus (not that Anacapa is much farther!) Santa Cruz is also closest to Campus Point, the most beautiful beach on campus (that is why I chose it.) Anacapa is slightly closer to campus; if you're riding your bike back to Santa Cruz, you always pass Anacapa. But beyond that, it really doesn't have any advantages. It seems like Anacapa has prettier girls this year but that's not important for you!"
Could be either or both. OJ has phosphorus and potassium.
"Sorry, I'll clarify. I'm looking specifically for physical media only. I guess i assumed most people would understand print meant printed on paper or similar medium. Sorry about that, my bad!"
"DJ Lance from Yo Gabba Gabba.  AKA Lance Robertson.

He is one cool motherfucker.  I worked an event in Akron Ohio, basically a glorified celebrity babysitting gig, and this guy was the most simultaneously badass and easygoing person I've ever met.  He was great with the kids too.  I could tell he really loved his job."
I had mine for a year but now the USB port is kind of finicky. Kind of disappointed. Went to buy another one but didn't see Anker. Got one for about $40 but it's plastic and can only charge my phone maybe twice before running out of juice. Need to order a new Anker online. Those things are tanks (well minus the USB port potentially breaking I guess).
"Yeah, forgot to mention I hate hot drinks."
"Pro Street honestly had some of the best feeling and most interesting racing in the NFS series.

From the track events to the speed challenges and even wheelie competitions. Plus the progression is super rewarding and unlike other NFS games you had to build multiple cars from the ground up to win every second of the ""crown."""
"The trick aspect is a thinly-veiled threat the children use to extort treats from you. Are you going to give into their demands and placate them with sweets, or are they going to have to make your life miserable? Tricking *them* is just kicking a hornets nest."
"Fallout 4.

Skyrim.

Dragon Age Inquisition."
"I have both, cant get enough of either them"
"You gotta play Gears of War 1, 2 and 3! Some of my best gaming memories playing those games, particularly Gears 2."
I just love the science side of Reddit.
"[Spoilers]

But there was no twist, at all. Unless you count the Japanese girl being a robot, but that's so predictable and minor anyway. It was entirely predictable. Robot breaks free. Fin."
"I've told this story on Reddit before, but I guess every year he does this event at SF Zoo where someone can buy, in an auction, a slumber party at SF Zoo and then get to have dinner with and a story read by Robin Williams. My dad's best friend had a bidding war with another lady, but was ultimately outbid. When RW heard about it, he agreed to do two nights, one for the lady and one for my dad's friend. 

I can never thank RW enough for doing that. It had been about a month after my father passed away, and needless to say my family was devastated. We almost couldn't handle going. But I'm glad we did; he was such an amazing person that for one night my family was happy. He laughed when I called him Mr. Williams, and read us ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". He was so nice and I'll always be grateful to him."
I would do it the other way if I'm not a drinker. I drink a lot so I buy the cheap shit. If I only drank occasionally I'd go for the expensive shit

"I like The Ocean House in Watch Hill, Rhode Island."
Imagine dismissing Ponting and Bradman only to have Steve Smith walk in
"I switch between a couple pairs. I have three pairs of Ray Ban aviators that I wear all the time. The classic, all black, and a frameless blue lens. On very special occasions or when I feel my outfit warrants it I'll wear my Tom Ford [Fanny](http://www.tomford.com/fany-sunglasses/FT0368.html) sunglasses. They are so precious so I don't like to wear them too often."
"Go to Ikea, buy a LACK shelf and then use the metal ""feet"" they sell for cabinets to make stands. They come in 3 sizes. I made 2 for my last office and I took em home when I left the job. They give you so much space."
