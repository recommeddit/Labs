33661,"Rural MN here. My Tesla is almost perfect for my needs. 135 mile round-trip commute+charging in my garage means no more additional trips to Casey's 2-3x a week. I honestly think rural America is going to surprise a lot of people with how rapidly we adopt EVs, especially as prices come down and the used market gets more fleshed out.

The charging infrastructure is already good enough for my needs. We took a family trip to Omaha over Memorial Day weekend just fine thanks to Superchargers.

The only rural midwest place where you might have trouble is ND but they've already got permits for superchargers on I-94.",best electric car

62752,"One of the reasons why I precisely believe that he only has an introductory grasp on modeling is the fact that he only has an Econ degree. To my knowledge, no undergrad econ degree has sufficient statistics requirements that I would trust a person, with just that qualification, to do rigorous work in statistics (I have never heard of any econ major taking more than the intro level). I wouldn't even trust someone with an undergrad degree in stats to do that either. I'd only trust someone with a quantitative PhD in stats or econometrics to do such work and there's a reason why it takes over a decade studying statistics to be called a ""statistician"". The fact that he does ""better than most"" isn't indicative because none of the others likewise have any background in stats either to my knowledge. I should add that most statisticians eschew things such as elections because there isn't enough data (and far too many variables) in order to make good predictions about it although I certainly could be wrong about this sentiment.

I work with a ton of scientists/statisticians/mathematicians/and ML researchers (all with PhDs) and I have never heard from them any positive opinion of Nate Silver and his work besides the fact that he makes stats ""sexy"". [Here](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/10/01/is-nate-silver/) is a charitable opinion of Nate Silver by a statistician that also alludes to the opposite sentiment which I espouse.",Best Data Science textbook
