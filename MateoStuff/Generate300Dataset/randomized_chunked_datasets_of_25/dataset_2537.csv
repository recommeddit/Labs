15596,best tree for the garden,"There are issues with black walnut, though. Like once it's harvested, not much will grow there because of chemicals in its roots. And they need to be pruned yearly so that there are no knots in the veneer."
66049,best college in california,">The horrible people that attend lowly state schools don’t obtain the resources or connections to spread their awful and self-interested ideas.

28776,best breakfast foods,"I have a garbage disposal so I don't have to worry about that part. If I didn't, I'd put the stopper in the drain, gather the shells, and toss in the trash."
43197,best detective show,"Eastbound and Down. 

It's nothing like TD, but after a season, it's nice to laugh a bit just to cleanse the palate before watching TD again."
33661,best electric car,"Rural MN here. My Tesla is almost perfect for my needs. 135 mile round-trip commute+charging in my garage means no more additional trips to Casey's 2-3x a week. I honestly think rural America is going to surprise a lot of people with how rapidly we adopt EVs, especially as prices come down and the used market gets more fleshed out.

The charging infrastructure is already good enough for my needs. We took a family trip to Omaha over Memorial Day weekend just fine thanks to Superchargers.

The only rural midwest place where you might have trouble is ND but they've already got permits for superchargers on I-94."
56904,best water brand,Mount Franklin. Its an Australian brand
62752,Best Data Science textbook,"One of the reasons why I precisely believe that he only has an introductory grasp on modeling is the fact that he only has an Econ degree. To my knowledge, no undergrad econ degree has sufficient statistics requirements that I would trust a person, with just that qualification, to do rigorous work in statistics (I have never heard of any econ major taking more than the intro level). I wouldn't even trust someone with an undergrad degree in stats to do that either. I'd only trust someone with a quantitative PhD in stats or econometrics to do such work and there's a reason why it takes over a decade studying statistics to be called a ""statistician"". The fact that he does ""better than most"" isn't indicative because none of the others likewise have any background in stats either to my knowledge. I should add that most statisticians eschew things such as elections because there isn't enough data (and far too many variables) in order to make good predictions about it although I certainly could be wrong about this sentiment.

I work with a ton of scientists/statisticians/mathematicians/and ML researchers (all with PhDs) and I have never heard from them any positive opinion of Nate Silver and his work besides the fact that he makes stats ""sexy"". [Here](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/10/01/is-nate-silver/) is a charitable opinion of Nate Silver by a statistician that also alludes to the opposite sentiment which I espouse."
41536,best instrument to play,"I cand remember the exact title, once I get on the PC I will try and find it.  But the video is him playing in a mall in Australia, he is wearing a white suit jacket if I remember correctly. The song is a homage to the aboriginals and when he played I was amazed at what he was doing."

I would suggest you look into some free bootcamps such ad [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to see if you like it. But if you need some help when you get stuck I recommend you [Practicum by Yandex](https://practicum.yandex.com/). Although there are many bootcamps out there I can recommend you only these ones because they are great online bootcamps that I 'm using myself. I wish you the best of luck with your coding learning journey!"
