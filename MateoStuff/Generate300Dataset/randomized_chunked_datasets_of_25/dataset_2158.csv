15724,best sunglasses for fashion,"Nope, you're correct. Both were originally US military contract holders; I believe Randolph currently holds the contract for ""Aviator"" glasses. They're very similar in hand although I \*think\* the Randolphs \*feel\* slightly heavier/thicker/more durable... but that's probably just my cognitive dissonance."
62795,Best Data Science textbook,"If you are interested  in a book on data science for natural sciences, Springer has a book called ""Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform""  [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319285290](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319285290)

34396,best NFL player,"I would give Messi that crown if he was always consistent. He's definitely the most talented ever. Copa America this year is a great example of his inconsistency. He just can't get over his championship game letdowns.

49523,best gaming monitor,"Always fun to get into this kind of stuff. 

In my opinion, it's not as important in those types of games, but there is a difference you can slightly tell, depending on your framerate and refresh rate of course. The buttery smoothness in general stuff even, it's so hard to go back to 60hz on my laptop. 

I would say if you need to save the money, a normal 60hz monitor would do fine. If not, I would definitely recommend a 120hz or 144hz monitor. Even if you can't tell the difference in game, it's still nice to have regardless."
