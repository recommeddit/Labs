33522,">hvac use wouldn't have changed the outcome.

Probably not the order of finish but wouldn't it have affected recharging needs and thus delayed the finish?

Either way we don't have the info on the other drivers' HVAC use so can't compare, unless C&D cares to elaborate.

So my assumption of this event being not as helpful as it could be is correct?",best electric car

23052,"I worked at a bar in a restaurant while in college and one night Kevin Hart came in to eat. He wasn't  really that famous at the time. I didn't know who he was, but I was curious as I had to go to the stock room to get a $1000+ bottle of champagne that he ordered in addition to pouring a bunch of really expensive top top shelf shots. His bill ended being well over $2000. The girl who had his table (who also didnt know who he was) said he was by far the most demanding and rude person she had encountered while working there and that he was extremely demeaning.

He ended up leaving a $4 tip, all in crumpled up singles.

Fuck Kevin Hart.",best celebrity

29505,"1. Far Cry 3 (xbox 360)- I was never into FPS until this game. I played some but never got into any campaigns. This one had me hooked instantly. The most fun I've had with any single game.

2. Uncharted 2 Among Thieves (ps3)- Excellent story and smooth controls. Difficulty gradually increases at a nice pace. 

3. Mike Tyson's Punch Out (NES)- One of two video games I've ever played with my dad. Our whole family loves boxing. Not so much a boxing game as it is a strategy one, but still insanely addicting. Presents a huge challenge. This game put hair on my balls at age 6. 

4. Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past (Super NES)- The original was way ahead of its time and this game showed it was no one hit wonder. Updated sound and graphics while returning to the original overhead gameplay enhanced the experience while keeping the charm of the original. 

5. Eternal Darkness (Gamecube)- I'm a fan of horror movies so this game had me intrigued. It had an interesting story and some unique cut scenes. If you haven't checked it out it is worth a look.",best game console

Also, make sure you check Pitaka MagEZ, not Pitaka Air. That one is even thinner and really does not seem to help much.",best iphone case
