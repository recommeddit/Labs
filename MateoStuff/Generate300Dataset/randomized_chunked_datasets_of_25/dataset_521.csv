29236,best game console,"I forgot about the handhelds, but I was talking about home consoles.

There are quite a few PSP games that are playable on PS3 as PSP Minis that you can download on the PlayStation Store. With homebrew, you can expose this emulator and load your own games, but compatibility is kinda poor.

As far as I know there isn't a way to run Vita games on any PlayStation home console."

There were years when I couldn't even pee alone.  Now that they're adults, I want all four of them together at home with us whenever possible. Perspective is a strange and wonderful thing."
63301,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Iâ€™m pretty sure this can be done on both iOS 11 and 12. For Zebra and Installer, just add their respective repos and you can install them from your default package manager (Cydia / Sileo). If you use Electra, I believe the latest version installs both Sileo and Cydia. If youâ€™re using Unc0ver, youâ€™ll need to use [Unc0ver Dark](https://github.com/nqcshady/unc0ver-dark) to add Sileo."
