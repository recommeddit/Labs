I’m currently on Endymion and wanted to advocate for not stopping after Fall of Hyperion. Different characters but very much a continuation of the same larger storyline.
My girlfriend says cologne is for douchebags. Maybe that's an east coast thing?
The acting in the show is down right awful haha come on....
"Let's put it this way. They're not going to hire you if you are incapable of doing the job. If they hire you, it's because they know you can do a decent job. However, you might have a leg up on the competition if you have personal connections with those in charge. Your resume is more likely to be seen, your glowing reviews from those you know will serve you well by placing you above other candidates, etc."
"I’m American though lol. I’ve just always had Xbox and so have my friends, so it just makes sense. I should honestly just not get the Xbox but I haven’t made up my mind."
"Did accounting, would probably go back and do engineering, which was my second choice. My salary is good and my ceiling is probably higher than many engineering roles, but engineering just seems more interesting."
don't know where you're going to get 2 lap dances and a beer for $50 unless you're paying your mom
"Lolll. It's expensive at most places, but you can find it for a pretty fair price at others."
"I like them. I kind of think people who dislike or hate them are dumb I guess. I can understand why people don’t want them (limited options, Costs , range ), but It beats me how people prefer something that’s pretty much destroying our future instead of something that’s environmentally responsible and conscious."
The buttons are nice and clicky for me on the iPhone 13 Pro Max leather case.

"The man killed himself by ripping his own bowels out, now that's hardcore."
"I work with kids on the spectrum and for my clients, there is only one that can/will wear a mask for more than 5 minutes. Obviously the whole country is a mess right now and I shouldn't be surprised but there seems to be absolutely no consideration or planning being done here in the US (PNW) for kids with disabilities. If my clients didn't have the insurance or money to pay for extra services or respite care they would be completely screwed."
"Well done on your reviews.  I happened to randomly buy a Ringke Onyx from eBay when I ordered my iPhone 12 Pro for $8.99.  

It is hands down the best everyday phone case I’ve ever had and I also highly recommend it."
Good ~~Bot~~ Mod
You have extremely good taste lol
"Oh, please. No one wants your two cents."
Staples are INFERIOR
"Were you pleased with the tamarind flavour? 
I don’t even know what is it, I’ll have to google it. 

Never had black cherry. Should have some some."
"I think the newer systems are near 2:1, but still not ideal."
I feel ya brobeans.
You must then also throw Delicatessen and Amelié onto the list. All wonderful.
He's Dunston.
I got the Dell 2721 for $405 and loving it. I think it's the best monitor of the bunch right now
Newbie here.  It requires payment.  Is that right?
