69634,"I went back for computer science for my master's. Highly recommend going back, also Protip: get a graduate assistantship. Most schools practically give them out to grad students and you either teach a 100 level course or do some menial labor for the school and get your tuition paid for AND a moderate stipend. You end up paying fees each semester which for me was about 2 grand a semester out of pocket but it's only 2-2.5 years vs 4 and if you work a second part time job and really cut expenses you can usually pay off everything without taking on more debt!",best major to study in college

26113,"Dwight D. Eisenhower, as a policy wonk, everything he did was pleasing.

1. Sponsored and signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which created the interstate highway system. It is, in my opinion, one of the single most efficient government projects in moderns times in terms of benefits gained vs. costs.

2. Sponsored and Signed the Civil Rights Bill of 1957, the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction (undermined by congress).

3. Balanced the budget by refusing to cut taxes and raise defense spending, in a time when there was immense pressure to do otherwise.

4. Ended the Korean War by negotiating with China. Controlled Cold War crises in Korea, Vietname, Formosa, Suez, Hungary, Berlin, and Russia",best politician

22833,"Paris Hilton. My car broke down on an autobahn in Germany. Managed to coast to sort of layby thing with a burger van and toilets in it. I was in a bad state because I can't speak any German, my phone had no credit and I didn't have my breakdown details with me so I had no idea what to do.

I unsuccessfully asked the guy in the burger van for help and he apparently didn't speak English so rather pathetically I started to cry. Then this big old American guy appeared and offered me a cup of tea in his motor home (it wasn't proper tea but that's besides the point). In the van was another guy and friggin Paris Hilton! I kid ye not. 

She was sweet and made me a sandwich and gave me a hug then proceeded to talk to me for 30mins about some old radio bits she'd bought in some show in Freidrichshafen. I didn't understand most of it. She said that when she wasn't working she liked to drive about Europe going to radio and air shows as if she put a hat on nobody ever recognised her.

Then they towed me to a garage at about 40km per hour (scarey stuff on the autobahn). Oh yeah and she sat in my car and asked if it was ok before she smoked.

32529,"Go to Los Claros. At the main square with all the bars in Cabo keep walking into ""real mexico"" past Harbard for like 5 blocks. Make sure to load up on toppings at the toppings bar. It's open until ~5pm. You'll be the only gringo there. Lunch will be ~$5.

If you are feeling less adventurous, the taco stand across from the Wyndham is okay also.

For late night chorizo (and only chorizo rest of menu is questionable) walk two blocks past Baja Junky away from the main strip to El tacazo.

Tamale truck in the main square at night is good, but probably a gamble.",best vacation resort
