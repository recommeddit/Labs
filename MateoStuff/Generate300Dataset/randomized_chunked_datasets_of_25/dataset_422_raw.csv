"Honestly? You don't need a full set, I find myself only ever using a 4H, a 2H, an HB, 2B and a 5B.

However, Staedtler makes pretty decent pencils. Don't go crazy and get the 32152452 pencil set, you only -really- need pencils ranging from 4H to 6B.

But while you are getting those pencils, make sure to pick up the rest of the supplies: A white [vinyl eraser](http://www.dickblick.com/items/21500-1002/?clickTracking=true&wmcp=google&wmcid=items&wmckw=21500-1002&CAWELAID=520010530000015242&gclid=CJ_Pw6KLqrcCFe07MgodNVYA5Q), as well as a [kneaded gum eraser](http://www.dickblick.com/products/prismacolor-kneaded-rubber-erasers/). Because mistakes happen."

"I forgot the specific link but I read somewhere that the issue is that almost every webcam uses USB2 due to some weird supply chain thing and that none of the webcams have an encoder inside so they are basically sending raw video through USB2 to the PC where it is encoded into something that can be sent through the internet. And if you are sending unencoded video through USB2 you need to compress that shit so hard you are left with such a mess that there’s nothing you can do to fix things.

Why hasn’t the market evolved to fit the need? Well conveniently a massive supply chain shock and semiconductor shortage hit at the same time meaning low scale low profit webcam makers didn’t have access to the parts to make better stuff."
"I worked around politics for a while and the charisma that comes off of some politicians is incredible. It could be a politician that you despise, but then after a two minute conversation you think that they are the greatest person ever. It's unreal. A lot of them are dicks, but the ones that really have the charisma factor are incredible."

"Every year my now 30 year old daughter writes me a letter.  These letters are a chronicle of our lives together  (I was a single mom).  Three years ago my daughter became a mom and that letter is a cherished, frequently read (I'm tearing up just thinking about it) reminder of the struggles and joys of those early years.  She know my heart.

You don't fully appreciate what your parents went through until you become a parent yourself.  My daughter, son-in-law and grandkids are my greatest joy. 

Write that letter.  Get her a little trinket to go along with it.  We do stocking stuffers...little goodies that we normally wouldn't buy for ourselves."

Fred Trueman (Eng)      
12th Man - Jonty Rhodes (Saf)      

The last fast bowling slot is incredibly hard to choose. Akram is a no brainer simply because he's the only left armer worthy of a spot and  he'd be picked even if he were a right arm bowler. Marshall is probably the greatest pace bowler of all time so that leaves that one spot. Fiery Fred had a great test record, the first player to ever take 300 test wickets and he did it with not only a brilliant average (21.57) but also a great strike rate of 49.4. Bowlers such as Ambrose, Garner, Lillee, McGrath etc had similarly great test stats but what puts Trueman ahead for me is his insane first class record:      
603 matches - 2304 wickets - 18.29 average - 43.2 strike rate      
Remarkable record and one which none of other candidates comes even close to (Ambrose is the highest wicket taker of the bowlers I mentioned with 941). Those numbers are better than even Marshall's with more wickets, a better average and better strike rate.      
I put Jonty as the 12th man obviously because he's the greatest fieldsman of all time and he isn't going to be doing anything else as 12th man."
