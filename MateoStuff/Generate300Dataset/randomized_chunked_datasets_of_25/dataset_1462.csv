7307,best iPhone,I have to make up my mind -still have my iPhone 6s Plus with a new battery installed last month but I want an upgrade -I do like the iPhone X as itâ€™s a premium built phone and has that Oled display -so itâ€™s either an iPhone XR which is not that much of an upgrade from a 6s plus as it has less pixels.so itâ€™s either iPhone X which I feel has the best design. iPhone XR v iPhone X
16381,best sunglasses for fashion,"For fashion, I'm not sure why anyone needs more than aviators, wayfarers, or club masters. I think these 3 will stand the test of time and between the 3, you can fit with any outfit and/or occasion. Whichever brand you get it from, it doesn't really matter. I have gone through various brands through out the years, and while this may generate 50/50 support/hate, I 100% believe Ray Bans be superior to everything else. I have gotten stuff from others like RE, but at the same price points, I just still believe RBs to be much better quality. I've flat out stepped on mine by accident and could never tell. They also seemed to be much more scratch resistant. For some cheaper alternatives, I've gotten Sunclouds which were ok for the price. I wouldn't have bought them with my own money though as I bought them with LL bean gift cards (the LL bean warranty at the time made them too hard to resist, though that may now be questionable)."

44091,best items under $100,the best way to improve any meals you eat. you can put basically any cheap meat in there and it will turn out delicious. the best part is being able to throw a bunch of stuff in it before leaving for work and coming home 9 hours later to a fully cooked meal that requires no more prep that throwing it on a plate.
47465,best state to visit in the United States,"Definitely Maui, Hawaii. It certainly feels like another country. The water was beautiful and dark blue and all the landscapes were all incredible and very diverse given the small size. Also- no snakes!

17339,best iOS game,"[Dragon Quest 8 is on iOS.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-quest-viii/id862972069?mt=8) You are missing Dragon Quest 8 from your list.

I don't see Dragon Quest IV-VI on their list, those are some of the best JRPGs ever made. Baldur's Gate 1/2 are also missing. Baldur's Gate 2 is arguably the best western RPG ever made. It's up there with KotOR and Final Fantasy VII in terms of influence.

edit: They have Dragon Warrior, an alternate name for [Dragon Quest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-quest/id911201894?mt=8). That's on iOS"
