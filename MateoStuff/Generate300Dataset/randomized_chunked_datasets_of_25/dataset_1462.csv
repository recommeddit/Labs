16381,"For fashion, I'm not sure why anyone needs more than aviators, wayfarers, or club masters. I think these 3 will stand the test of time and between the 3, you can fit with any outfit and/or occasion. Whichever brand you get it from, it doesn't really matter. I have gone through various brands through out the years, and while this may generate 50/50 support/hate, I 100% believe Ray Bans be superior to everything else. I have gotten stuff from others like RE, but at the same price points, I just still believe RBs to be much better quality. I've flat out stepped on mine by accident and could never tell. They also seemed to be much more scratch resistant. For some cheaper alternatives, I've gotten Sunclouds which were ok for the price. I wouldn't have bought them with my own money though as I bought them with LL bean gift cards (the LL bean warranty at the time made them too hard to resist, though that may now be questionable).",best sunglasses for fashion

17339,"[Dragon Quest 8 is on iOS.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-quest-viii/id862972069?mt=8) You are missing Dragon Quest 8 from your list.

I don't see Dragon Quest IV-VI on their list, those are some of the best JRPGs ever made. Baldur's Gate 1/2 are also missing. Baldur's Gate 2 is arguably the best western RPG ever made. It's up there with KotOR and Final Fantasy VII in terms of influence.
