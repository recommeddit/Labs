46365,"As a former champion trick-or-treater turned candy-bestower, here is what I think:

* One of two, probably two, just incase you get that polite kid who's allergic to almond that doesn't want to say anything when he gets an almond joy. Little kids tend to get one (ie. infant- 3) because they simply can't handle that much candy, and won't eat it anyways.

* I recommend dropping it in the bag, so you won't be faced with the future-douchebag-of-America child who thinks taking 8 pieces is fair game.

* If you give 2 to each, you'd have enough candy for 125 kids, which sounds like a good amount, but if there are a shit ton of kids in the area, you might run out. This is totally a judgement call. (Reminder: if you have ""too much"" it'll just result  in you having extra candy. This can never be a bad thing.)

* If you turn on a front light, in your yard or in your front hall, kids will know that you have candy to give them.

* If you have a doorbell, or if your usual haunt in your house is close to the door, kids can knock, so you don't have to sit by the door, but 5-8 is a good time where most kids will come through. You might have a few stragglers, however.

* If you run out of candy, just shut off the lights. I've never heard of someone's house getting TPed because they didn't have any candy left.",best trick or treating candy

8444,"Most of the population is moderate or high risk. It’s not overkill at all. People are just uninformed about what determines their risk for caries. Think about what percent of the population takes some sort of medication with xerostomia as a side effect. All of those people are high risk. If you have a patient with interproximal restorations on most or all of their posterior teeth they are high risk, even if they brush well. Same with crowns. Patients should know they can get a better life span out of their restorations by using a rx toothpaste. I would say 75% of the patients I see over the age of 40 fall into one if not both of those categories.",best toothpaste

We found a promo that would give us 66,000 Hyatt points if we got married at a Hyatt property in 2014. Couple that with a Hyatt credit card where we get 3x points for all Hyatt expenditures and we will use our points to pay for a (effectively) free all-inclusive week at a Hyatt property.

We are thinking Hyatt Zilara in Cancun because it is adults only.",best vacation resort
