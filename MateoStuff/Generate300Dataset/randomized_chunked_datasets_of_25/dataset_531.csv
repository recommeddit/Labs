60091,best perfume,"My favourite cheap perfume was Taylor Swift Enchanted Wonderstruck. Itâ€™s probably my favourite perfume Iâ€™ve ever owned. It got discontinued I think and now itâ€™s selling for $70-$100 :( 

If anyone knows a close dupe Iâ€™m all ears!"
55460,best action and adventure novel series,"Hey thanks for sticking with the series and I'm glad you like how things wrapped up. IIRC The Crown Conspiracy (book #1 of that series was written in 2002, so yeah many moons ago. I hope I've improved and keep improving. That's part of what's great about writing there is always more to learn and do."
33263,best electric car,"Serious question: what about bidirectional charging is so appealing? Not only will the majority of infrastructure not support it, but the battery inside the vehicle wonâ€™t power much for long. Seems a little too gimmicky to meâ€¦something that sounds cool but really isnâ€™t practical and wonâ€™t be used."
11398,best gifts for dad,"A hug.  

Not So Ninja edit: not one dad cares about 'presents', all we want is a 'gift', and there's a big difference !  
We just want what we want every day: a hug, a kiss, an 'I love you'.  

To me fathers day has no meaning, because it'd be sad if your kid would only think about you on that one day. Luckily, no kid ever does that, they love you all year around, so just give us a hug, a kiss, an 'I love you'.  

And they almost all do.  
That's what being a dad and your child is about.  

And, Michelle, if you read this: I love you too."

23129,best social networking site for CS,"Social media can work to your advantage because, among other things, it can help extend your personal and professional network.

Twitter is generally pretty popular among the dev community as a broadcast and interaction medium.

I'd also suggest creating a github account. Having code samples easily available is generally quite helpful.

Linked in is also a good idea.

Facebook really depends on how you use it. I'd honestly suggest keeping it friends only for most of your content if you use it."

My first modern hobby game was Agricola and I had no trouble with it. I had played Catan and Carcassonne before that, but nothing like Agricola.
