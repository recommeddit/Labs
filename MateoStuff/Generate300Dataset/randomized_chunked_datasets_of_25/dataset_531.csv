33263,"Serious question: what about bidirectional charging is so appealing?

11398,"A hug.  

Not So Ninja edit: not one dad cares about 'presents', all we want is a 'gift', and there's a big difference !  
We just want what we want every day: a hug, a kiss, an 'I love you'.  

To me fathers day has no meaning, because it'd be sad if your kid would only think about you on that one day. Luckily, no kid ever does that, they love you all year around, so just give us a hug, a kiss, an 'I love you'.  

And they almost all do.  
That's what being a dad and your child is about.  

And, Michelle, if you read this: I love you too.",best gifts for dad

23129,"Social media can work to your advantage because, among other things, it can help extend your personal and professional network.

Twitter is generally pretty popular among the dev community as a broadcast and interaction medium.

I'd also suggest creating a github account. Having code samples easily available is generally quite helpful.

Linked in is also a good idea.

Facebook really depends on how you use it. I'd honestly suggest keeping it friends only for most of your content if you use it.",best social networking site for CS
