25238,best spiderman actor,"I loved the Tobey Maguire movies, for the most part, growing up with them they will always have a place in my heart and I think he did a great job capturing the character.

But Tom Holland just brings such a freshness, youthful, and true quality to the character...yeah, he's my favorite."

33080,best energy drink,"Is it bad that I spent a good five seconds trying to figure out what drug ""naps"" was slang for?"
68167,best science fiction novel,"Reading Vance is like comfort food for me, he's just so much fun."
25836,best cricket teams of all time,He's making a joke
2907,best headphones,"I have the hifiman he500.  When I bought them, they were $799.99 and at the time, I was using the ultrasone pro 900 for gaming at night when my wife was sleeping and the k702 when open headphones could be used.  There is more detail in the hifimans but I can’t really say that they have the positional accuracy for some reason. I’m thinking it’s probably because of the bass in the he500 was definitely more prominent than the upper mids that are prominent in the k702. This is where most of the positional cues are."
26952,best board games,"For me personally, the writing, the repetitive nature of encounters, the setup is starting to wear on me.

Also probably the biggest one is the nature of the game to prioritize some classes mechanics over others. I like the variety that appears to be available, but once you’re out there and playing a lot of the mechanics fall by the wayside because they simply aren’t worth using. Trying to set up combos over multiple turns feels next to impossible, and with some classes that just ruins their mechanics.

My group is currently playing forgotten circles, and as you see the creators trying to make more and more unique scenarios, you can see the “different” classes not being able to work with the mechanics as well. If you are a bruiser who can tank some dmg, then id say all scenarios will work for you, if you aren’t, then you’ll come across more than a few where you feel like you’re along for the ride at best, and a liability at worst.

Like I said, I’m not trying to shit on the game, I do enjoy it and have played it more than any other game we have, but I just don’t feel it’s polished enough to warrant a 10/10"

33297,best electric car,It’s already been 6 months and things are no better. If you reserve today it’ll be a 2023 lightning.
53664,best medicine for a cold,"Ibuprofen and acetaminophen can be taken at the same time. My mom works in a dentist office and they tell their patients to take up to 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 400mg of ibuprofen at the same time instead of prescribing opiates for pain. Can be taken up to 3x/day for no more than 3 days consecutively. 

Mind you, this can cause similar GI issues as opiates like constipation, so drink plenty of water. And of course consult your actual doctor for guidance if this is okay for you personally."

This is a good start, from here you will find many connections to other albums... not all can be enjoyable at first listening but you gotta start somewhere"
14627,best romantic novel,"If you like historicals set in other places than the UK, check out books by Chloe Flowers. The Hart Trilogy has to be read in order, but the 4th and 5th don’t. Lots of humor, action and romance. She really did her history homework!"
47896,best color to paint with,People are so obsessed with this color lately. I'm kind of sick of it.
31156,best country to live in,It seems CPH has the same problems as Helsinki when it comes to littering and bad behaviour in public. In Helsinki we have the exactly same things that you complained earlier about and I honestly wish there were tougher laws on littering the environment and acting badly in public but Nordic people are too tolerant of it.
32639,best vacation resort,"Playa is a fun little island. We stayed right on the strip and it was a great time. A bit touristy sure, but orders of magnitude less than Cancun.  If you are there at the right time, you can dive with whale sharks.  Freaking awesome."
60570,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Episodes, really underrated"
5027,best home improvement store,Yep. I had a couple of guys in the lumber department talk down to me (female building stuff) so I left my lumber at Lowes and went to Home Depot. Never been back and I’ve never regretted it.
