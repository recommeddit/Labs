2907,"I have the hifiman he500.  When I bought them, they were $799.99 and at the time, I was using the ultrasone pro 900 for gaming at night when my wife was sleeping and the k702 when open headphones could be used.  There is more detail in the hifimans but I can’t really say that they have the positional accuracy for some reason. I’m thinking it’s probably because of the bass in the he500 was definitely more prominent than the upper mids that are prominent in the k702. This is where most of the positional cues are.",best headphones
26952,"For me personally, the writing, the repetitive nature of encounters, the setup is starting to wear on me.

Also probably the biggest one is the nature of the game to prioritize some classes mechanics over others. I like the variety that appears to be available, but once you’re out there and playing a lot of the mechanics fall by the wayside because they simply aren’t worth using. Trying to set up combos over multiple turns feels next to impossible, and with some classes that just ruins their mechanics.

My group is currently playing forgotten circles, and as you see the creators trying to make more and more unique scenarios, you can see the “different” classes not being able to work with the mechanics as well. If you are a bruiser who can tank some dmg, then id say all scenarios will work for you, if you aren’t, then you’ll come across more than a few where you feel like you’re along for the ride at best, and a liability at worst.

Like I said, I’m not trying to shit on the game, I do enjoy it and have played it more than any other game we have, but I just don’t feel it’s polished enough to warrant a 10/10",best board games

53664,"Ibuprofen and acetaminophen can be taken at the same time. My mom works in a dentist office and they tell their patients to take up to 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 400mg of ibuprofen at the same time instead of prescribing opiates for pain. Can be taken up to 3x/day for no more than 3 days consecutively. 

Mind you, this can cause similar GI issues as opiates like constipation, so drink plenty of water. And of course consult your actual doctor for guidance if this is okay for you personally.",best medicine for a cold
