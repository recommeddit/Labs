3154,"IMO my top ticks are the StreamCam first, C922 second, and C920 third. All great cameras. The C920 is the gold standard for webcams. The other 2 have updated performance and features that may or may not fit what you're looking for. Again, I cannot stress how important lighting is. Thats what frustrates me about some of the reviews out there is that they only look at basic out-of-the-box performance and don't try to squeeze the best look out of it.",best webcamera

21951,"He and I had a funny encounter. We were both at a coffee shop in the Bowery at like 6:30 AM. We were the only ones there. He'd ordered a fancy drink of some sort so had to stand there and wait. I ordered a filter but it was a long process pour over type thing.

So he and I were stood there next to each other for 3-4 minutes. It was awkward because I don't really talk to celebrities / public figures. But at the same time it was weird because it was just the two of us and it was obvious I knew who he was.

In the end I gave him the chin nod. He winked and gave me the chin nod. That cleared the air and we were able to get on with our day.",best celebrity

52012,"I bought a Case-Mate Karat Marble Case for my new iPhone 13 Pro Max and it has little bumps to ensure the phone lies flat on its back - I’m obsessed! This detail wasn’t obvious in the product photos online, so I was pleasantly surprised at the quality when it rocked up and adore how the bottom half blends into clear to show the gorgeous gold iPhone colour. So so happy with my choice, DM me if you want me to send you a photo",best iphone case

Also, Bush Sr. was a pretty cool guy, but that was about it.

I love X2, but it sure beat the shit out of me last time I rode it. I rode outside the first two times, but the last time I rode inside, 5th row. And I felt like I was dying the whole time. It was truly just as rough as the fabled legends told. But on the outside I found it to be absolutely incredible.",best roller coaster at six flags
8352,"Cheap toothpaste works just fine, the important part is that it contains fluoride (>1'000ppm for adults). And you have to brush (gently, not forcefully, no point making your gums bleed) for a full two-three minutes. With a toothbrush that isn't frayed, so get a new one per month...

Fluoride works but it's not instantaneous, so in addition to mechanical cleaning (brushing) it just needs time. If you're a quick 15-second brusher then no matter how good your toothpaste is, it just won't do much.

It's just like a washing machine, detergent obviously works but the effect is not instantaneous either hence it's not done in a minute.",best toothpaste
52153,"I'm a huge fan of the Spigen Liquid Air cases, been using them since the iPhone 6+. 15 bucks and they last about 3 years.

The cases also don't add much bulk to the phone and the rear is textured for easy grip.",best iphone case
