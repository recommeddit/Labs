13625,best research paper archive,Another good trick if you can’t get it for free and it’s from somewhere odd.... copy paste the title into google. Sometimes you can find a PDF of the paper! When you click the direct file link it will bring up the PDF for free and you won’t have to pay 60 dollars for a week access.
33727,best electric car,I think we are just in the infancy stage and we are going to look back at electric cars right now the way we look at people from the 90s who carried those massive brick cell phones.

22289,best celebrity,"I actually saw Jared Leto, too, at Hard Haunted Mansion last year.  He was somewhat ""out of it"" haha and didn't really say anything, but he wasn't mean or anything, just kind of in his own world. 

I met some celebrities when I worked for the ticket office in college.  Matt Groening was extremely friendly, and was really happy when I was (lamely) praising of Futurama (and Simpsons) haha.  He had to sign something when he picked up his ticket from me at the will call, and I was considering taking it as a memento, but didn't for some reason...  Also, John Lithgow was nice, too, and so was David Sedaris."

37650,best Marvel movie,"Huh. Seems pretty solid, with a few surprising individual results (I guess ScreenRant really didn't like Thor: Ragnarok) but overall reflects general sentiment.

I too am *shocked* that the one MCU movie nominated for Best Picture is also generally agreed to be one of the best MCU movies. Real shocker there. Just shocking."

17136,best iOS game,"I’m just so polarised on this game. In a simple take, it’s just a dice game. Everything is about a dice roll. 
In another take, it’s a comfortable strategy fantasy game, great for kicking back and seeing how some light strategy pans out against the dice rolls.

Honestly not sure it’s anywhere near my top 20 though even. (I’m not trying to put your opinion down though). 

Have you tried other digital board games on iOS? Through the Ages and Race for the Galaxy are brilliant as is Star Realms. Those are some of my faves for board games."
