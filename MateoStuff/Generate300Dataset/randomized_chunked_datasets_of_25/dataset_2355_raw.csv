Love this idea!
"Aeropress 

Been using it 10+ years to make espresso-related drinks."
"Well, the left tackle position became much more important after he did [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=PHCXNt4P8Xg#t=45s) to Joe Theismann."
"This is a cool chart! Hello, Mr. Stetsdogg. I have a question for you.   
When the carrier states multiple carriers is that in list of priority for that plan?  
Thanks!"
"Belgian beer. Best beer in the world.

(A few favourites would be Chimay Blue, St. Bernardus Abt. 12, Westvleteren 12, Waterloo and Tripel Karmeliet - that last one is really sweet and tasty, but still has a good deep beer taste. It’s great!)"
"Dont think, just Ubuntu.
Later you can hop wherever you want."
"This is for wireless gaming headsets. Not Bluetooth headphones.

Also no, there isn't something that lasts a month. 20-30 hours is the average."

"This! And then you’re like “that was the twist?! that’s so dumb” because you were expecting something crazy. I was doing what OP is trying to do earlier this year, went through a bunch of twist movies and I didn’t enjoy any of the twist because of my pre knowledge of a possible one"
"Whoops....

Not...Mr. Magorioum's Wonder Emporium

I meant the imaginarium of doctor parnussus, which i know it seems like if a movie is good you'd remember the name, but seriously it is good.

Thank you /u/toastedfart

Surprised to not find it here. Used to be on netflix not sure anymore.

It is heath ledger's last movie and he died during shooting."
"Assorted massage oils and scented candles. They might not ""need"" something but at least they can do something."
"So many years so many times I’ve seen that video and I’ve never seen the full version

I feel like I can close a chapter of my life from the early aughts"
"If you're using the non-photo blue or poppy(maybe crimson) red pencils you must be wanting to scan your sketches? That's really about the only reason I think you would *need* them (unless you just like the way they draw, which I do, lol). If scanning is your plan, don't worry about their ability to be erased, because the whole idea behind the reds and blues is how easy they are to remove in photoshop. 

As for erasers, I really like the standard issue Staedler white eraser...its an o,d stand by. Also get yourself a kneadable eraser too because they can be super usefull. Also try sticky-tack. We used that in college when we were too poor to afford kneadable erasers, and they turned out to be oretty awesome at the job."
"I do a lot of interactive VBA stuff. I have macros that are started from graphical interfaces that read in local files and upload processed results to a midrange database server, run following queries on that external server, download results and generate local report files.

I'm not getting any of that done in Sheets."
"Berkey water filter. Per gallon cost is around 3 cents I believe.

It is well regarded."
"I see. I'd say that a great choice is the Acer Swift X on my list. Strong specs (suitable for general use and video editing), good battery life, and a low weight."
Your comment inspired me! I just checked out the first Outlander book from Overdrive! It’s good so far!!
"""Pretty subjective""? Yeah, you don't have a clue about what you're talking about, but you feel that you are here with in the Arch and Manjaro turf and any fanboyism of this kind is automatically accepted."
"You probably enjoy making a proper impression when meeting new people. Not too bland or approachable....you'd prefer to make a firm statement without shouting it. (I am sorry, I am bad at guessing.)"
"Just watched this again today. Tip top movie. But the ""mindfuck twist"" aspect of it is easy to miss"
"Alright, thanks! Any idea in which order I should learn them?

(No idea what happened with the upvote button, didn't mean to downvote you :D)"
"This is one of the best resources for an intro to react.  I like it, because you can play with the code while learning. Stephen Grider Udemy course was amazing also!

"I don't think I've ever heard bad things about it :). It's near the top of my TBR list, but that's still like 15 books deep. One day!"
