"Rusty’s is great if you know what to order. Go pan pizza, get all the awesome toppings, and you can’t go wrong. I would also recommend *not* getting the small. For whatever reason, I’ve found personal, medium, and large to be beyond excellent, but the small is just weak.

Well I think image quality is the same and yet it’s still changed. There’s a weird grittiness to the image but only noticeable when looking at solid colours especially white
Hey! I have an elecom smooth coming in the mail today. Mind sharing your install tip?
Why would brave be more memory efficient than any other chromium based browser? Does it do something special?
how is pokemon not ur top anime? weirdchamp
Yeah it has some fantastic twist. Such a good show. And Kristin bell does an excellent job acting shocked and fake cussing
Atonement.
"I agree! It's one of the best Lovecraft-ish movies made, IMHO. (That's also because the other ones haven't been particularly good, unfortunately.)"
"Man, we've been going to Lowe's because even without occupant limiting it's empty.

Oddly for us, the Depot has a better selection of everything, but if I can't find something there there's a good chance Lowe's has it. It's like Lowe's looked at Home Depot's inventory and said ""stock all the normal stuff, and then stock all the slightly-off sizes of everything that Home Depot doesn't have."""
"It's large compared to most of the games in the top 50 positions, which are rated similar or higher than their BGG ranking: the only similar case is Through The Ages."
All including PC cause I love gaming as a whole and own all.
"Kanye West ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"". Such an amazing album."
"I'm ngl, Bada Bing is such a bop. Jones' verse on that is so braggadocious, I love it. Barry White and Lose Lose are probably my favourites, his flows on there are crazy. Agree though on them making a part 2 or a whole other album. I'm here for more Jones and Fraud"
"I do agree with you, Id buy exercise equipment, but I disagree with the specifics

Most of what you need for fitness is already there. If you have space then you can workout. A rug should do just fine if you don't have a yoga mat. 

Heres my list for what to buy

**1. A pullup bar** I bought a doorframe mounting bar for $12 at modells. You can do chinups, rows, front and back levers (google these if you don't know them), etc

**2. Some sort of sandbag to use as a weight**. If you already have a bag as a shell, you can buy 50 pounds of gravel/sand/rubber mulch at home depot for $3-5 dollars. This means you can get 100 pounds of weight for under 10 bucks to deadlift, squat, overhead press, bench press, etc. It isn't as versatile as a barbell but its still good. 

I'm averse to handweights because they don't do much. Go big or go home- 8 pound hand weights aren't going to do much (especially if you are a young male, I can certainly understand why people who are older wouldnt be able to throw around an 100 lb bag).

**3. Miscellaneous other stuff**, I suppose a mat to pad the ground. I got mine for 30 bucks
Also, you could invest in a good fitness book. Off the top of my head Never Gymless by Ross Enamait gives good bang for your buck"
"Your attempt at riding your big high horse out of here  is both old, over used, and cliche. Have a kid or something."

Have you tried anything like Parallels to emulate a Windows environment and run Excel from there?
