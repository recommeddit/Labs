I used to be a home depot guy, but the home depots here in Charlotte, especially up in concord where I live, are pretty shit since we're like 20 minutes away from Lowe's corporate.",best home improvement store
21135,"It's got it's lines in it that do legit pump you up. There's ""how could I make a man out of you?"" and if you happen to have just failed out a set or something, that's a good ""I'll show you!"" moment. And then there's a line that's similar to ""Harder, better, faster, stronger"" that goes ""We must be swift as the coursing river (Chorus yelling ""BE A MAN!"") With all the force of a great typhoon (BE A MAN!) With all the strength of a raging fire!"" I like to time my sets along with the chorus of songs and pump up lines in general, so this one does work really well. Nothing like being told to be a man when I'm about to putter out.",best workout music

7242,"I would recommend the iPhone 11. Way better cameras and it’ll be supported for longer than the XR. The XR isn’t a bad phone, but I’d recommend the iPhone 11 unless you don’t care about cameras. Apple really improved in the photography area from the jump between the XR and iPhone 11. The XR’s camera is okay/average, IMO. Not “bad,” but it can’t compete with the iPhone 11’s.",best iPhone
