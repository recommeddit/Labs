4829,best home improvement store,"Lowe's for me. Girlfriend works at Lowe's corporate, so any mention of the orange store is heresy. And I'm a veteran, and they give 10% off up to $500 per day for all active or prior military. 

I used to be a home depot guy, but the home depots here in Charlotte, especially up in concord where I live, are pretty shit since we're like 20 minutes away from Lowe's corporate."
21135,best workout music,"It's got it's lines in it that do legit pump you up. There's ""how could I make a man out of you?"" and if you happen to have just failed out a set or something, that's a good ""I'll show you!"" moment. And then there's a line that's similar to ""Harder, better, faster, stronger"" that goes ""We must be swift as the coursing river (Chorus yelling ""BE A MAN!"") With all the force of a great typhoon (BE A MAN!) With all the strength of a raging fire!"" I like to time my sets along with the chorus of songs and pump up lines in general, so this one does work really well. Nothing like being told to be a man when I'm about to putter out."

Al Gore when he was Vice-president. Not so much his secret service.... He was out jogging. He actually stopped to talk to us in our car and took our address. He sent us an autographed picture to me and my sister.
 
George W. Bush. I just got to shake his hand, but it was a firm handshake and he seemed to be a solid guy."

28595,best breakfast foods,">I think most people only eat breakfast if their wife or mother makes it for them.

7242,best iPhone,"I would recommend the iPhone 11. Way better cameras and it’ll be supported for longer than the XR. The XR isn’t a bad phone, but I’d recommend the iPhone 11 unless you don’t care about cameras. Apple really improved in the photography area from the jump between the XR and iPhone 11. The XR’s camera is okay/average, IMO. Not “bad,” but it can’t compete with the iPhone 11’s."

It’s just a beautiful city and a perfect getaway. I was there in October and the weather was perfect."

69594,best major to study in college,"Absolutely. Anyone studying a language should learn something substantial in addition. I have a degree in journalism but every job I have ever had (journalism, research, marketing etc) , I got because I one-upped other applicants with my language skills. I didn't need a degree in a language but granted, my background enabled me to learn languages as part of my life.


If you really wanna learn a language and study the culture, history etc, you should also look into acquiring additional skills and experience in other fields."
