34363,best NFL player,"I have a hard time saying that Aaron Donald isn't the best player in the NFL, and the most valuable if you adjust for positional values.  Do I think Mahomes makes a bigger impact on a game?  Yes, but he is a QB.  Every QB should make a bigger impact than a DT in the overall outcome of the game...  But, I just don't see anyone nearly as value for their position in the NFL as Aaron Donald.  The guy does the job of both a DE and a DT on the same play, all while facing double teams.  If Donald goes down for an injury, I think the Rams D fall to the middle of the pack, if not worse."
68099,best science fiction novel,"Love Altered Carbon and and Dune. The TV series of AC left me really unimpressed though. 

Got to admit that I got about a third of the way through Anathem and put it down to read another book and then just haven’t gone back to it in a couple of years. The maths was hard."

30983,best country to live in,"Probably the best to travel and see. If you are having trouble making life long friends among people you have been around with decades then it may be very unlikely you would be able to make those friends in a different country. I have seen many somewhat lonely people try to start anew somewhere else in the world because they can't relate to the United States but have even more trouble being on their own in a new country.

That being said, if you have spent considerable time over in a new country and have had great success then go for it."

31773,best hotel to live in,"How do you pay for the hotel?  In other words, normally if you're staying at a hotel for three nights, you check in, give a credit card, and check out three days later.  I'm assuming in your case, they don't just wait until you're gone (a year) before charging you for your stay.  So how does it work?"

55635,best action and adventure novel series,"Richard K. Morgan's [Altered Carbon](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40445.Altered_Carbon) seemed pretty action-packed to me. It literally starts with a bang, and doesn't let up a whole lot most of the way through."
35152,best NFL player,"I think you're probably confusing this ranking with the Pro Bowl voting, that does close out in November."

71404,best movies with a cool twist,"Soylent green was way ahead of its time considering the plot twist! Citizen Kane was also similar, such a creative twist, and the feeling that they never found out *SPOILER: that Rosebud was his childhood sled, but we, the viewers got to know it was so smart SPOILER*"
