34363,"I have a hard time saying that Aaron Donald isn't the best player in the NFL, and the most valuable if you adjust for positional values.  Do I think Mahomes makes a bigger impact on a game?  Yes, but he is a QB.  Every QB should make a bigger impact than a DT in the overall outcome of the game...  But, I just don't see anyone nearly as value for their position in the NFL as Aaron Donald.  The guy does the job of both a DE and a DT on the same play, all while facing double teams.  If Donald goes down for an injury, I think the Rams D fall to the middle of the pack, if not worse.",best NFL player

If you are having trouble making life long friends among people you have been around with decades then it may be very unlikely you would be able to make those friends in a different country. I have seen many somewhat lonely people try to start anew somewhere else in the world because they can't relate to the United States but have even more trouble being on their own in a new country.

That being said, if you have spent considerable time over in a new country and have had great success then go for it.",best country to live in
