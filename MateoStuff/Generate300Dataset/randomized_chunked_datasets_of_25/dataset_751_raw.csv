The leather cases are actually pretty durable. Personally get the silicone ones though as they’re don’t get stupidly dirty quickly
"Then think of what kind of music you like and pick the instrument that fits it. Maybe also consider how expensive the instrument is. 

Oh, one other that might be good - French horn. You can play anywhere but a jazz band, and it's the star instrument of movie soundtracks. Pretty difficult to play, though, there are a lot of partials for each fingering. 

You're going to want a teacher whatever you pick."
"For Math/Physics we usually post our pre-prints on a free hosting website call Arxiv.. so for every article you see on the journal, just find its Arxiv equivalence.

Those those don't post on Arxiv are usually obnoxious pure mathematicians that have no friends... so you're not missing much, morally."
"Hate to be one of the chorus of endless voices screaming it, but here goes anyway:

GEORGE RR MARTIN A Song of Ice and Fire!!

Yes it is fantasy. It is light on magic and HUGE on adventure. I say all this knowing you have either already read it or already heard about it. But if you haven't read it, I think you should.

One man's opinion. Let the downvotes roll!"
"Wasn’t a hotel. My family rented a beach house for a week for Spring Breaks. They usually were a block from the Destin Florida beach and had a pool. Great memories.

One year we stayed at my Aunt and Uncle’s company rental  in Panama Beach (Uncle had a hand in a massive business on his side of the family, and let us stay at this humongous house on a country club. Oh yeah it had a dock and a small boat too)
They even let us use their private jet + crew! 

Otherwise there was a nice place in Nashville that had THE BEST shower and breakfast. It was great because my sisters, mom, and I had been out all night for New Year’s."

Thankfully I joined after the app was improved so much. I love the app so much.
"Does it?  The question isn't QB, or recent and the QB position wasn't always as important as it is now given rule changes (even then, this question lends itself to a lot of debate.  Given how others paved the way for Tom)

Taking into consideration importance to a position, Montana is more important than Brady to the sport, so Montana > Brady, but some might say player X is > Montana, and we have ourselves a debate but I'm okay with then having without regency bias."
I'll drive 40 minutes away to go to Menards over the home Depot that's 5 minutes from my house. I don't know that I've ever had a bad experience there.
"I think Symphogear and Kill la Kill do hype better than Gurren Lagann, but Gurren Lagann is more widely appreciated."
"Hey, friends, I just made a folder of these files for my own purposes, so I t thought I might share it. Here are all of the PDFs and replies for comments above 10 upvotes (at the time of posting). Hope that's okay, mods.

"We got a shelter dog.  We can't go to the dog park or hang out with other dogs because he's too darn excitable and hates car rides.  With kids that young, op, you'll need to do a lot of visits and hopefully get a dog that was surrendered and has a truthful bio as far as if it's good with kids.  Also, your kids are probably too young to volunteer at a shelter."
"USB2 sure.

USB3.2 can handle 4k30 RAW."
It entirely depends on what you play / settings. Isn’t the dell 27” one on sale currently for like 470 at bestbuy?
I don't think it's fair for you to say how another person should react about a death in their lives.
"So far nobody's said game development, but I'll just say don't go for it if you enjoy having free time."

Am I missing something? I was just looking at this monitor on dells site and it’s showing 5 day delivery time and in stock?
"Its more like a mechanic telling you to just buy whatever API rated oil you want in the proper weight.Which is what I tell people, because it's true."
It really is. To me rum and cream soda have similar flavor profiles. So the two flavors blend really well together.
"Does it have to be an iphone? I used to o be an apple disciple but tried switching to android and love it. For what little you use your phone for, you really don't need an iPhone. I use a moto g power, bought about 6 months ago. $50 for Google Fi users, which I also recommend. The battery life is great and it does absolutely everything I want.  I would expand your horizons and see what's out there! iPhones are great but they're really not the only game in town anymore. Maybe they never were,  but I only woke up to how good the quality of other phones can be a couple years ago."
