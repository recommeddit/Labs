33673,best electric car,The Countryman is the only EV in the US market.
34957,best NFL player,Diggs. But I think he is way (10-15 spots not 30) too high.  And probably Ramsey
63159,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Yeah, there is a lot of drama surrounding it and the dev. Personally I don’t care. It’s pretty, fast and works well.

As for installing it on a jailbreak other than Electra/Chimera I would wait for it to go open source so it’s easier to maintain. The dev of Sileo doesn’t officially support it for other jailbreaks which is understandable."
42529,best detective show,Also Justified is a good series
5422,best home improvement store,"I've found Lowes has a better outdoor plant/garden selection. You also can't find anyone to help.  If you need a specific valve, fitting, screw, forget it.  Everything has been rummaged through and no longer in the appropriate box/area.  Also, they don't have self check-out and there is always someone in line at the one check-out aisle that is open that will try to return or argue about a coupon.

I mostly go to HD."
104,best terminal file manager reddit,"> zsh or bash, amongst many others are quite powerful."
22505,best celebrity,It's hard to be incognito when you're a giant sentient vegetable.
6679,best iPhone,I got the battery replaced in my 8 and it runs like new. It was $50.
73406,best battery bank,"I have the ZMI and for power, yeah, it's solid. I wish it were lighter but that's the trade-off (for now at least). It's 14oz which weighs as much as the bag I carry it in!"
42519,best detective show,"Agree. It was also better than S3, IMO."
8521,best toothpaste,Maybe he's neither and simply markets for Oral B..
67299,axios alternatives reddit,"I agreed with this mostly.

I've been using fetch for a long time and only found and issue with it in the past week - fetch has no timeout. There are workarounds for this but they generally mean leaving the connection alive and just rejecting a wrapping promise which feels... dirty. 

Hope fully this short coming will be address in the future"
22944,best celebrity,"Bruce Campbell. Awesome dude.

He signed my Army of Darkness poster 'Stay groovy - Ash'"
20378,best workout music,"That's tough, real tough. In no particular order I'd probably go with -

* The Tim Ferriss Show
* Planet Money
* 99% Invisible
* Hidden Brain
* Last Podcast On The Left
* Freakonomics Radio
* SinCast

That's actually 7, but those are the ones I'll stop other podcasts to listen to. None of them are fitness podcasts actually, but Tim Ferriss has interviewed Arnold, Patrick Arnold(the father of prohormones), along with other athletes and they're good episodes."
27939,best breakfast foods,"Hash browns, and a bacon biscuit. Mmmhmmmm,"
45966,best trick or treating candy,"Full size candy bars. Anything without coconut - but I highly recommend you save those for the neighborhood kids. 

Otherwise, faster than you can say Twitter or Hobo Code - you'll be scooped out and run asunder by the advancing hoards."
2539,best headphones,This thread is an audiophile's worst nightmare....
6171,best Netflix documentary,"Came here to back up Athlete A. Not only does it follow the investigation and arrest of Dr. Larry Nassar, it also delves into the complete apathy that USA Gymnastics had for their athletes well-being as well as some insight to how sports culture (everywhere, but particularly in the US) can place value over achievement than well-being and safety.

Edit: it has a hell of a powerful ending too."
57569,best cologne,"I’ll second the ysl la nuit d’homme. I get more compliments on that than any other cologne. 

Also creed aventus is great but overhyped for the money. I don’t agree that the knockoff from armauf is the same."
54733,best water filter,Get a reverse osmosis system for like 300$
29904,best money managing app,">Monarch

Thanks for sharing another great platform….."
5894,best programming language for web development,Which languages are the big names?
25639,best cricket teams of all time,Those colours...can't tell them apart. Being red-green colour deficient doesn't help either.
8790,best toothpaste,"A 50/50 combo of water and hydrogen peroxide is great for gingivitis for  short term use. As long as you don’t swallow it, it won’t hurt you."
34795,best NFL player,He is certifiably \#Good.
