63159,"Yeah, there is a lot of drama surrounding it and the dev. Personally I don’t care. It’s pretty, fast and works well.

As for installing it on a jailbreak other than Electra/Chimera I would wait for it to go open source so it’s easier to maintain. The dev of Sileo doesn’t officially support it for other jailbreaks which is understandable.",best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit

Everything has been rummaged through and no longer in the appropriate box/area.  Also, they don't have self check-out and there is always someone in line at the one check-out aisle that is open that will try to return or argue about a coupon.

* The Tim Ferriss Show
* Planet Money
* 99% Invisible
* Hidden Brain
* Last Podcast On The Left
* Freakonomics Radio
* SinCast

That's actually 7, but those are the ones I'll stop other podcasts to listen to. None of them are fitness podcasts actually, but Tim Ferriss has interviewed Arnold, Patrick Arnold(the father of prohormones), along with other athletes and they're good episodes.",best workout music
