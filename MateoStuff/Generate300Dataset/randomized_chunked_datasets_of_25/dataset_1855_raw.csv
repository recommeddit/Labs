That was very informative. Do you know what Hyperfuse is? I have it on my Nike Hypergamer basketball shoes.

"I have to co sign this. I used to use issey miyake for years, then I got sauvage and I've had co workers literally sniff me and ask what it was"
"I have gotten the most compliments from Hanae Mori. Don't seem to find others with it, so you should be good on that front."
cool. thanks for your input.. Opera seems to be the mostly used browser by many.
"Thanks for the tips! I will look into Hazel and cherry :)  Only really chose laurel for the back as I read it grew quite fast, definitely enough  room to mix in some of your other suggestions."

BGT is my home park and I’ve gone to Howl-O-Scream every year. I don’t know how it compares to other Halloween events but I like it.
"I read a great many of those books in my youth. I still don't see Ender's game rising to the level of several of those other books. Ender's game builds up to one big twist plot-wise. The characters are relatively underdeveloped. 

I think several other books give broader visions of the future or humanity or the mind. Many of them are stunning especially if you consider them in their time of publication. 

I loved Enders Game but it just didn't take me where Heinlen, Asimov, Pournelle, and several other did. Or Simmons, Vinge, Banks, or Scalzi did afterwards."

You don’t think it’s because UCI and UCSB have improved whereas UCSD has relatively stagnated?
They're streets ahead
"The best part is that they don't just tell you, they tell you and tell you and tell you and show you and give you everything you need to know it and you still never get it til the end. Then when you watch it again, and every time you watch it, it's an even better experience picking up on new and subtle ways they revealed the secret the entire time."

that one's actually a pretty great scent"
"Things like this annoy me. It's like the fable of the US and Soviets trying to write things in space: the US over engineered the problem and the Soviets just took a pencil. 

Just learn how to cook eggs, people! It'll take a while but ppl have been managing for generations!

EDIT: Inspired by that stupid, several hundred dollar laundry folding machine..."
"Yo, what did the deleted comment say?"
"I love gift cards for online retailers.  Not only do you get to shop from home, but then it comes in the mail!  Books, clothing, craft stuff, cooking tools, or general favourite websites. I could spend hours browsing stuff on thinkgeek, jimmybeanswool, etsy, or even just amazon. 

Sometimes just getting out with a kid to a store is way more work than it's worth.  Shopping online relieves that stress."
"Thanks :). It can be extended to individual players, but it does get more computationally intensive because there are many more players than teams. 

The data I collected dates to the early 1990s and it takes data for about 6 years to compute the ranking. So the earliest rank I have is from 1996 or so and indeed the highest ranked ODI team is Cronje's team around '96-99. On the other hand Australia has been ranked first in ODIs for a longer period than all the other teams combined in the period shown."
Haha. I tried to use that because it came with the case so I thought why not. It actually was annoying because it would constantly get caught on stuff so yeah....idk how people wear those.
I second the Langham. Wife and I stayed at the one in Melbourne and had a fantastic time.
I have no idea what that subreddit is but I think it made me retarded.
My bank's account app. It's super accurate. ;P
Yeah that is what I wrote. Oh wait it is not.
"That 90's United team did win the treble mind, first team in England to do so, so i kinda get why they went for the 90's team."
