51741,best iphone case,wont it get a lot of micro-scratches from dirt and dust in your pockets?
39656,best podcast for biologists,Came to ask the same thing. I teach 7th grade
18930,best YouTube video,"Pretty sneaky sis. 

But I'm on alien blue."
40064,best Chrome extensions,I think the real question though is how secure are these extensions when it comes to privacy and are they harvesting your data?
7177,best iPhone,"As much as I consider it a really stupid choice to hide the throttling (and given the CA lawsuit, I'd say Apple would agree with me now), the motive was clearly to actually keep phones in people's pockets. The slow down would only trigger if a battery died unexpectedly, meaning people who'd be out to replace their phones anyway were affected by the throttling."
34998,best NFL player,"No Largent

....feels bad man"
67000,best soccer team in the world,"We're both biased I guess..... But admit it, Atleti were less than a minute away from beating Real ..."
45755,best trick or treating candy,We moved in to our neighborhood a little over a year and a half ago and our neighborhood is full of kids! We don't have any kids but we pass out candy and love seeing all the kids dressed up! It's also a good way to introduce ourselves to the parents that live on the street.
61882,Best RPG game on PS4,"They are literally all the same. The same formula. There are RPGs made in japan that are just called RPG or action RPG. 

Nobody even said witcher 3 was bad. Why must you fanboys get so riled up whenever anyone claims something about your precious game that you don't agree on?

Downvoting every comment I make isn't going to accomplish anything."
55674,best action and adventure novel series,"Yeah, that's my problem with all the Stephenson I've read. Good to decent SF, but I can't stand it because he fails to introduce information about his admittedly interesting worlds and ideas without massive info-dumps."
73767,best matte screen protector for ipad,I would probably try out both and see if i can deal with writing on glass :)
9100,best toothpaste,Are there any adverse effects from *only* using a toothpaste like sensodyne?
8787,best toothpaste,"Gargling actually doesn't expose any part of your mouth to the fluid -- its all in your throat when you gargle. Just swish it around inside your mouth. 

But also, ***NO***. Christ no, you might as well clean your mouth with bleach. This sort of advice comes from people who just thing bacteria of any kind = bad, not realizing that the only reason we're ***alive*** is because of the bacteria keeping us alive in our bodies. 

Yes, there are harmful bacteria that cause cavities. There are also helpful ones that heal mouth damage. Hydrogen peroxide doesn't distinguish between these -- it just kills everything. Mouthwash obviously does the same, but is fortified with fluoride and other things to help offset that, and can be useful in certain cases."
62012,Best RPG game on PS4,"If you’re a Bethesda RPG fan, I think you’ll like Outer Worlds"
24583,best anime,"Urara Meirochou - Beautiful world. Amazing sound track. Really unique. Absolutely adorable.    

K-On!! - Took what K-On set up and ran with it. Amazing feels. Love the girls. The slow build up over two cours and the finale was breath taking and I still cry to this day.    

Hidamari Sketch - All-    
It's hard to rank this one as S1, S2 and so far S3 have all been 10/10. The art style is fantastic. Bringing realistic items into the anime. The characters feel real. Everything that happens feels like it could happen tomorrow. Everything is just nice and simple. The OST is perfect. One of the best SoL/CGDDCT I've seen.  

The Haruhi movie... Hard to explain without spoilers. But 10/10.    

Non Non Biyori S2.   
One of the most beautiful anime I've seen. Soundtrack is comfy and brings out the country vibe. This takes S1 but gets a bit more comedy in it, but gives us some of the best character bonding backstory I've ever witnessed. This is such a relaxing, adorable time. Little slow for some but I never felt bored with any of it."
23674,best car racing video game,"First game I thought of was Test Drive Unlimited. THe progression was awesome. Getting new racing licenses, buying better and better cars, buying new houses etc!

They're making Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown but I have no idea what it's going to be like... fingers crossed though."
18141,best Kardashian,"I 100% believe the [0$ tip receipt ](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/kendall-jenner-accused-not-tipping-receipts)with her name on it, personally. The bar is very popular and there’s no reason they would make it up as a successful business lol"
