69262,"Your major is a much bigger factor in your salary/employability after graduation. If you decide to go to graduate school then the prestige of your undergraduate school is unimportant. On the other hand, if you were hypothetically determined to become a banker out of undergrad, then your undergrad school would be important. It's the same way for most top jobs/companies.

My two recommendations would be to first add some hard skills to your curriculum (whatever those skills may be). Second, only apply to an MBA program after having management experience (might sound counter-intuitive, but employers like concrete evidence you're an effective manager).",best major to study in college

61166,"Hey, I love season 4. I admit the big bad isn't the best, but I think Riley gets a bad rap. He was the rebound guy. Despite what xander may have told Buffy, he was always the rebound guy, and in that capacity he was fine. Additionally I don't think beer bad is as awful as everyone says. There are also some of my favorite episodes of the series: something blue, a new man, restless, superstar, fear itself. It has spike join the regular cast, which is awesome, and even a terrible episode like where the wild things are has it's moments like Giles' coffee house gig. Season four is essential.",Best comedy show on Netflix
16735,"Do your research on hamsters. They need a very large tank (40 gallon minimum) and nearly all species need to be solo. They are funny inquisitive creatures. Having a large tank with room to burrow and explore helps with the smell and with their aggression. A bored hamster in a small cage will bite. 

I kept rats for a few years. Very intelligent, can learn their names and simple tricks. Must have at least two at a time since they are social creatures. Males will mark their territory. They also need a lot of space for the same reason a hamster does. 

Personally I wouldn't trust a 7 year old with either of these critters. I'd start either smaller like fish or sturdier like a ball python.",best pet for toddlers

57174,"The pH likely would only change in a very small way if at all. Especially with bottled water. You probably wouldn't even have a test that's sensitive enough unless you work for a college with an expensive chemistry lab. 


The pH only starts to change dramatically when it's something like sea or polluted water, which has a lot of stuff mixed in. (Like I'd you scooped out water from the toilet, you'd likely have either human waste or bathroom cleaner mixed in, which would affect the pH).",best water brand
