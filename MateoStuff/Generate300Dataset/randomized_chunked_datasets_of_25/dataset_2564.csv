11560,best gifts for dad,"I should get my dad a ""world's best mom"" mug"
18497,best YouTube video,The *Is It a Good Idea to Microwave This?* series.
51068,best rap album,13 days late BUT at least they put Dark Twisted Fantasy at 21. IMO it's the greatest rap album ever.
50535,best rap album,The kanye train will always find its way in some how or another
23670,best car racing video game,"some of the NFS, probably Heat but I don't know how deep the customization is because I stopped playing NFS because it's shitty driving physics"
71170,best movies with a cool twist,Harakiri
36485,best alcoholic drink,Yeah ive had an L.I.T. that tasted like unwashed celery before. It was a pretty rough bar though.
35440,best alcoholic drink,I like horse feathers. Rye whiskey with ginger beer and a bit of bitters.
45413,best gaming system,"Both for gaming. I was using a PS4 for exclusives and shooters that are filled with cheating on pc, ie BFV. Now that Sony is putting exclusives on Steam, Im in no hurry for a PS5. I might bite if a Twisted Metal of Socom reboot get announced."
41070,best instrument to play,"Hand drums for sure. Cajon, bongos, conga, even just a snare. Percussion instruments are the best and easiest rudimentary instruments to learn. Heck, even the table or your leg can become an instrument."
25531,best cricket teams of all time,yay dravid <3
11775,best gifts for dad,"I think the company that makes them is called Big Black Cock, try a google image search.  If not I got a sweet deal on a bag of candy penises at hairybears.com.  (it was a few years ago, I am not sure if they still sell them.)"
52802,best hiphop album,you listen to LoDeck?
16011,best sunglasses for fashion,"Prescription! Right now, [something cheap](http://www.zennioptical.com/472112-metal-alloy-full-rim-frame-with-spring-hinges.html) I got from Zenni Optical. When I get my next pair, I'm going to have sunglass lenses put into a pair of funky Alain Mikli frames that don't quite fit my current style as regular glasses."
72696,best wireless lightweight mouse,"XM1 is the goat.

but for reviews man, you should really separate your personal bias for a company and just look at the product. In my opinion anyway.

XM1 is also my last mouse for a long time now, after buying and trying many mice. I sold all my mice recently, the search came to an end =)"
42928,best detective show,yeah i agree it was good in the first 2 or 3 seasons then they really started dragging things out. This latest season seems like a CW show. its like dumb drama i couldnt get past the second episode. they should have ended it at 5 or something in my opinion.
25972,best cricket teams of all time,This would've been my pick too but I preferred the team with Symonds after Martyn retired. Martyn is definitely the better batsman but Symonds was just more interesting to watch bat.
39921,best Chrome extensions,ITT: people not explaining what the extension does
47667,best state to visit in the United States,6/10
68211,best science fiction novel,I'm so glad to see Attanasio on one of these lists!
51934,best iphone case,Yeah - hopefully they’ve rectified the issues from last year’s case cause that’s the one I wanted too but saw that it didn’t age that well. I opted for a NOMAD case this time around.
36182,best alcoholic drink,"The Last Word! Equal parts:

-Green Chartreuse

-Gin

-Luxardo Marasca liqueur 

-Lime Juice

Shake well with ice, strain into glass and garnish with a Maraschino cherry (Luxardo also produces Maraschino cherries that actually taste like something, if you're already slappin' down the cash for the Chartreuse you might as well get these as well, very much worth it)."
31153,best country to live in,"Maybe cleaner than the US. Also, keep in mind that while visiting you wont see the actual situation. 

But Denmark is quite dirty as it is normal practice to spit gum on the street, pee anywhere you please etc. The worst part is during weekends - the litter is idiotic. The millenials here have no respect and trash everything. If municipalities didnt spend so much money on cleaning during weekends, the place would be fking ridicilous. And this is not exclusive to party zones, the whole city(all major DK cities) turn into trash so often. 

I come from Latvia, so one would assume its worse there but I have never experienced so much trash, litter and dirty streets as here. And I have lived here for 4 years and in 3 different regions."
67052,best places to skydive in california,My recommendation is DO NOT go to the Lodi one. It's generally the cheapest but their safety record is terrible.
