but for reviews man, you should really separate your personal bias for a company and just look at the product. In my opinion anyway.

42928,yeah i agree it was good in the first 2 or 3 seasons then they really started dragging things out. This latest season seems like a CW show. its like dumb drama i couldnt get past the second episode. they should have ended it at 5 or something in my opinion.,best detective show
25972,This would've been my pick too but I preferred the team with Symonds after Martyn retired. Martyn is definitely the better batsman but Symonds was just more interesting to watch bat.,best cricket teams of all time

-Green Chartreuse

-Gin

-Luxardo Marasca liqueur 

-Lime Juice

Shake well with ice, strain into glass and garnish with a Maraschino cherry (Luxardo also produces Maraschino cherries that actually taste like something, if you're already slappin' down the cash for the Chartreuse you might as well get these as well, very much worth it).",best alcoholic drink
31153,"Maybe cleaner than the US. Also, keep in mind that while visiting you wont see the actual situation. 

But Denmark is quite dirty as it is normal practice to spit gum on the street, pee anywhere you please etc. The worst part is during weekends - the litter is idiotic. The millenials here have no respect and trash everything. If municipalities didnt spend so much money on cleaning during weekends, the place would be fking ridicilous. And this is not exclusive to party zones, the whole city(all major DK cities) turn into trash so often. 

I come from Latvia, so one would assume its worse there but I have never experienced so much trash, litter and dirty streets as here. And I have lived here for 4 years and in 3 different regions.",best country to live in
