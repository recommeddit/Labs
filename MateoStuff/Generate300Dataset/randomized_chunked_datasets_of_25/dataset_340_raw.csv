"That would actually be Endgame, but I did enjoy it so you’re right there

But least I have something to say about the movie other than “it sucked”. Way to tackle my points lol. Never seen someone have such strong feelings about a movie and then have so much trouble talking about their problems with it"
"[This](http://www.history.vt.edu/MxAmWar/Newspapers/Niles/Nilesj1847NovDec.htm#NR73.184Nov.201847Gen.Winfield) has a number of primary sources, including Winfield Scott's official report for Chapultepec. [This](http://community.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Marines%20in%20the%20Mexican%20War%20%20PCN%2019000412200.pdf) is a paper with some good coverage of the Marines in that battle specifically. While much of the conclusions are outdated, Justin Smith's [*The War With Mexico*](http://www.amazon.com/The-With-Mexico-Justin-Smith/dp/0844614130) continues to be invaluable for its use of primary source material unavailable elsewhere. It is also available for free online, thanks to its age. 

More generally speaking, the best book to my knowledge detailing the military history of the Mexican War is K. Jack Bauer's [*The Mexican War, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mexican-1846-1848-Jack-Bauer/dp/0803261071). You may also find Robert Selph Henry's [The Story of the Mexican War](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0306803496?tag=thomacom-20) a good introduction. Focusing on the perspective of the American soldier is James M. Mccaffrey's [*Army of Manifest Destiny: The American Soldier in the Mexican War, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/Army-Manifest-Destiny-1846-1848-Experience/dp/0814755054). Richard Bruce Winder's [*Mr. Polk's Army: The American Military Experience in the Mexican War*](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Polks-Army-Experience-University/dp/1585440337) is, in many ways, similar and improved but has no discussion of Chapultepec specifically. /u/SnakeGD09's suggestion, John Eisenhower's [*So Far From God: The U. S. War With Mexico, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/So-Far-From-God-1846-1848/dp/0806132795) is not a campaign history but is a good and comprehensive general history. His evaluation of Winfield Scott is particularly valuable. A newer history of the war with great insights on the Mexican side is Timothy Hendersons's [*A Glorious Defeat: Mexico and Its War with the United States*](http://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Defeat-Mexico-United-States/dp/0809049678). Other books of interest on different aspects of the war, which may be more, less, or not at all useful, depending on what it is on which you decide to focus, include John H. Schroeder's important [*Mr. Polk's War: American Opposition and Dissent, 1846-1848*](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Polks-War-Opposition-1846-1848/dp/0299061604) and Robert W. Johannsen's [*To the Halls of the Montezumas: The Mexican War in the American Imagination*](http://www.amazon.com/To-Halls-Montezumas-American-Imagination/dp/0195049810/ref=cm_rdp_product). Also potentially useful is the first volume of Douglas Southall Freeman's [*R. E. Lee: A Biography*](http://www.amazon.com/R-E-Lee-Biography-Vol/dp/1931313369).

I am not familiar with /u/SnakeGD09's suggestion of [*A Gallant Little Army: The Mexico City Campaign*](http://www.amazon.com/Gallant-Little-Army-Campaign-Studies/dp/0700615415), but it looks like it is especially relevant to your paper and I've heard it is quite good."
"And that's just their opinion. I don't know how they can rank it below the UEFA Cup if the UEFA Cup was literally a tier below it according to UEFA themselves. It's easier to dismiss it now that it doesn't actually exist anymore, but plenty of giant-killings happened in that competition. Real Madrid lost to Chelsea and Aberdeen in the Cup Winners' Cup, it's the only European trophy we've never won."

You piqued my interest enough to look into buying the book, only to find its the last in the series. is it a prerequisite to have read the others?"
"I've heard great things about them, but haven't gotten to them yet. I believe there's one set in the Civil War that I've been meaning to pick up!"
"Yes, I agree a 100% I bought a tent and split it up between 3 friends we each paid like 50 bucks and the summers are always amazing when we get to camp somewhere for a whole weekend."
It's fucking exhilarating!

I think that beige/off white are a great place to start! There is a reason they use those so often. My personal opinion is it doesn’t look as good when people pick one single color and use it throughout the entire house. Even a slight shift in color between the kitchen and living room and bedrooms makes a space feel more homey to me. 
And you can always add more color once you settle in."
"Apart from fluoride which helps a bit, my understanding has always been that toothpaste is mostly useless. I've asked a couple dentists which ummed and aahed for a while before mumbling that all things considered, it might be better to use toothpaste. They didn't elaborate though."
i use vim. but i also  **enjoy sublimetext 3** (i can actually recommend it really strongly: https://www.sublimetext.com/ go check it out if you haven't heard of it. It's free for evaluation but support the devs if you enjoy it as much as i do)

"[X Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLPA0Dhi1VXQDGbkXwjDUzQ)

Guy recreates famous airline incidents in a flight simulator and overlays the actual ATC transcripts. Gives background on the pilots and planes in the beginning and the FAA/NTSB incident summaries at the end. Also adds in any real photos/videos of the incidents if they exist, as well as CGI simulations when applicable. Some of them result in everyone onboard perishing, a handful involve everyone surviving (due to amazing piloting efforts I may add), and others result in a mix of fatalities and survivors but it always keeps you guessing until the end. The causes of the incidents vary from hi-jacking, inclement weather, poor maintenance, and pilot error among others. Each video is about 10 mins long and super informative. Some of my favorites include the gimli glider, flight 855, and the impossible landing of flight 232."
