59635,"You're a younger guy, on the more athletic side, most of your friends are guys from college (for now, you'll probably easily acquire/are acquiring a similar group from work- currently somewhat hindered by the pandemic.) You're probably doing/have done well academically, but nothing too crazy. Outwardly stable family life, probably upper middle class, raised in the burbs. You come off easygoing and that's mostly true, but you when you have trauma/grief you tend to mask it so as not to bother others, so most people don't know it when something's up with you unless they're on your very (very) short list of intimate confidantes. You're considered an all around solid dude. You're also single and super straight. You smoke weed but more in a party way vs. stoner way.",best perfume
5011,"Thank you! I couldn't have done it without a lot of help and direction from wiser adults who helped guide me through the process. 

I do think the coolest thing here is that home Depot invested in a project that would help their community, and also gain a loyal customer for life. Interestingly enough, I just bought my first home last year and it happened to be right next to the very same home Depot that helped me. It's equidistant to the nearest Lowe's, but I still to this day feel almost obligated, in a good way, to support HD. It feels good to do all my diy shopping there during social distancing.",best home improvement store
5918,"It’s more to personal preference. I’m personally not a fan of Vue, especially when used with templates rather than JSX. A lot of it feels like magic, with bindings abstracted away to the point where you don’t really know _how_ it works, you just know that it does.",best programming language for web development
22995,"David Beckham.

I didnt know who he was at the time.   I was staying at the grand Hyatt in hong kong and galaxy was there for an exhibition game.

There were a lot of fan girls outside with posters and shit in the roped off area near the front entrance.

I'm in the elevator and DB walks in.  I give him a nod and he gives me one back.  Then I ask him if he knows what all the commotion outside is.  He just shrugs and says it must be someone famous staying there.    We get to his floor and he gives me a wave goodbye and exits.


My work colleague later tells me that Beckham is staying there based on the pics he saw the fans waiving.   I look up his pic online and realize its the dude I was chatting with in the elevator.

26085,"Thanks for this. I figured from what I read (cough...Simpsons episodes I have seen) that Washington and Lincoln would have truly been the business. Just cause Abe was assassinated doesn't mean much really (How many people seriously would have ever seriously considered murdering John Lennon? And I hate hippies... ;-) ). I think America probably has the closest examples to respect politicians. But maybe that is just through me watching a lot of Hollywood shit in my life.

As for Australia. I have heard Billy Hughes and Gough Whitlam (Prime ministers) were respected but I am pretty sure due to the two party political system in Australia it would have been evenly divided.",best politician

1489,"**Top 3**: Realistically my top flavors are all acutely associated with a specific memory. So with that caveat 1) Gelato Messina's pomegranate raspberry brownie - I make my own now (of that exact flavor) and it's my favorite ... but dang nab it nothing compares to that memory. 2) Brandy butter, not because it's the most amazing thing ever, but because it is the perfect encapsulation of childhood Christmas memories, at home with my grandmother, when I now live far far away (in another country). Blueberry citrus - from my friendly semi-local ice cream parlor (and so much better than my attempts), and which we had at our wedding!

**Surprisingly good flavor**: I still remember my first lemon ice cream (not sorbet) as a teenager - it was perfect! (I was never really a fan of 'sour' flavors). Separately, red bean paste (so long as it's smooth not crunch). 

**Weirdest**: Taro (nope!), and durian (ALL THE NOPE!) - they were entirely appropriate for where I was living at the time, but not really my thing :)",best ice cream flavor

That said, I don't really regret it.  College is often a lot less about what you learn and more about just learning how to learn.  You'll forget the specifics a few years after you graduate, but you'll learn lifelong lessons about time management, planning, socialization and critical thinking skills that will really help you in your adult life.",best major to study in college
