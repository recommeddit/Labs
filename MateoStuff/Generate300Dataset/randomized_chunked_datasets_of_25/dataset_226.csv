30572,best Mexican war to study,"No, I was thinking more of the US selling weapons to the Allies and not selling them quite so much to the Axis."
59635,best perfume,"You're a younger guy, on the more athletic side, most of your friends are guys from college (for now, you'll probably easily acquire/are acquiring a similar group from work- currently somewhat hindered by the pandemic.) You're probably doing/have done well academically, but nothing too crazy. Outwardly stable family life, probably upper middle class, raised in the burbs. You come off easygoing and that's mostly true, but you when you have trauma/grief you tend to mask it so as not to bother others, so most people don't know it when something's up with you unless they're on your very (very) short list of intimate confidantes. You're considered an all around solid dude. You're also single and super straight. You smoke weed but more in a party way vs. stoner way."
5011,best home improvement store,"Thank you! I couldn't have done it without a lot of help and direction from wiser adults who helped guide me through the process. 

I do think the coolest thing here is that home Depot invested in a project that would help their community, and also gain a loyal customer for life. Interestingly enough, I just bought my first home last year and it happened to be right next to the very same home Depot that helped me. It's equidistant to the nearest Lowe's, but I still to this day feel almost obligated, in a good way, to support HD. It feels good to do all my diy shopping there during social distancing."
5918,best programming language for web development,"It’s more to personal preference. I’m personally not a fan of Vue, especially when used with templates rather than JSX. A lot of it feels like magic, with bindings abstracted away to the point where you don’t really know _how_ it works, you just know that it does."
22995,best celebrity,"David Beckham.

I didnt know who he was at the time.   I was staying at the grand Hyatt in hong kong and galaxy was there for an exhibition game.

There were a lot of fan girls outside with posters and shit in the roped off area near the front entrance.

I'm in the elevator and DB walks in.  I give him a nod and he gives me one back.  Then I ask him if he knows what all the commotion outside is.  He just shrugs and says it must be someone famous staying there.    We get to his floor and he gives me a wave goodbye and exits.


My work colleague later tells me that Beckham is staying there based on the pics he saw the fans waiving.   I look up his pic online and realize its the dude I was chatting with in the elevator.

nice guy."
36587,best alcoholic drink,"Ever try lagavulin? It's another islay, it's wonderful."
70271,best major to study in college,"Yeah I was in the same boat when I was 16. You're probably right but culinary school looks like so much fun to me, plus some of the schools offer chocolate classes. I took a cupcake decorating class and enjoyed it so much! I would love to get experience at a bakery"
73034,best Linux distro,Red Hat will fix packages or applications in the standard release if they're not working with certified products.
6834,best iPhone,"7 Plus because of the battery life and camera, with my XS Max at a close second

62928,Best Data Science textbook,"That link doesnt work   
 
EDIT: Its working now."
6763,best iPhone,This was my first iPhone and I loved it!
56401,best desktop monitor,"Yeah, I was impressed with the Omen as well so I never thought I'd ever consider it a downgrade to anything. But 270Hz and ULMB is pretty awesome.

There's 2 decent reviews of the Predator on youtube: Bijan and therightplace."
69534,best major to study in college,"Someone already mentioned STEM's. Also, accounting. My friend got into a Master's program and a guaranteed job at a large accounting firm. He's 22 making $70k + benefits and his salary, bonuses, and paid vacation time will increase every year."
16971,best iOS game,"You’ll want to be playing on a plus sized phone at the least. And it’s currently a battery fiend.
Just a heads up."
15896,best sunglasses for fashion,How about Shuron?
64132,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,probably best to check on r/animepiracy
17427,best iOS game,Gotta have 2 spaces at the end of a line before a line break on mobile
26085,best politician,"Thanks for this. I figured from what I read (cough...Simpsons episodes I have seen) that Washington and Lincoln would have truly been the business. Just cause Abe was assassinated doesn't mean much really (How many people seriously would have ever seriously considered murdering John Lennon? And I hate hippies... ;-) ). I think America probably has the closest examples to respect politicians. But maybe that is just through me watching a lot of Hollywood shit in my life.

As for Australia. I have heard Billy Hughes and Gough Whitlam (Prime ministers) were respected but I am pretty sure due to the two party political system in Australia it would have been evenly divided."
30669,best country to live in,They are the retarded younger sister of the Muslim world. There is a reason we don't talk about that place!
1489,best ice cream flavor,"**Top 3**: Realistically my top flavors are all acutely associated with a specific memory. So with that caveat 1) Gelato Messina's pomegranate raspberry brownie - I make my own now (of that exact flavor) and it's my favorite ... but dang nab it nothing compares to that memory. 2) Brandy butter, not because it's the most amazing thing ever, but because it is the perfect encapsulation of childhood Christmas memories, at home with my grandmother, when I now live far far away (in another country). Blueberry citrus - from my friendly semi-local ice cream parlor (and so much better than my attempts), and which we had at our wedding!

**Surprisingly good flavor**: I still remember my first lemon ice cream (not sorbet) as a teenager - it was perfect! (I was never really a fan of 'sour' flavors). Separately, red bean paste (so long as it's smooth not crunch). 

**Weirdest**: Taro (nope!), and durian (ALL THE NOPE!) - they were entirely appropriate for where I was living at the time, but not really my thing :)"
47525,best state to visit in the United States,"Only one. 
Disney Land."
41060,best instrument to play,Harmonica. You can't hit a wrong note if it's played solo
19025,best YouTube video,Except for... The Mongols (we're the exception!)
60996,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Easily Archer. One of the funniest, most well written shows ever in my opinion,"
69308,best major to study in college,"I graduated with a degree in archaeology and a minor in French literature, and it did fuck all for my eventual career (web dev) besides allowing me to say on my resume that I was a college graduate.  That said, I don't really regret it.  College is often a lot less about what you learn and more about just learning how to learn.  You'll forget the specifics a few years after you graduate, but you'll learn lifelong lessons about time management, planning, socialization and critical thinking skills that will really help you in your adult life."
