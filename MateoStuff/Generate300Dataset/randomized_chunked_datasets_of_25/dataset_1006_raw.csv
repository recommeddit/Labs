Samuel L. Jackson at the Calgary stampede in Canada. He was super nice. My family went up for it because my uncle is part of the committee that organizes the stampede every year and he got us VIP seating. I was a kid at the time and I was like does your wallet really say OBAMF? He laughed and said he left that one at home. Of course when I told the story at school I told everyone his wallet did in fact say that.

I really liked that show shame it didn't stay on longer.
Thank you; it was fun to write! I hope you'll share some favourites as well.
LOVE Rochas Femme.
Throw spark EV in that as well.

Is anyone else gonna say it first?
"- Don’t F!ck with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer (I couldn’t even watch this at times bc the videos were SO upsetting, so I legit would cover my eyes like a child. But everything else? Super intriguing!)
- Evil Genius: History’s most diabolical bank heist
- American murder- Family next door (on Chris and Shannan Watts, and their children. Just...yikes. Pretty horrific)
- Going Clear- A study of the church of Scientology (THIS is HBO, but I rly wanted to include it bc it dives so deeply into the toxic world of Scientology, and the effect it has in its members. Truly powerful)

Still finishing The Cecil Hotel rn, I’ll let u know lol. Everything else- SO good! EDIT- I forgot to include “Fyre” however there’s like 5 of these man so idk which one I actually watched but- dude has issues and he’s still robbing ppl to this day. Pretty fked, sparked a lively debate in my household anyway."
Another person using vs code. I did use eclipse back when I was coding in Java. I used notepad+ as well back when I was on Windows for some really light stuff.
"I'm planning to get the Apple Leather case. I have one for my 5 and I like it a lot. Gotten a lot of compliments on the looks too.

Are you looking for something that protects it from drops too? Or just something for very basic protection like on a table or in a bag etc?"
"The ones I've owned over the years: Pitaka Pro, Spigen, Speck, Otterbox.

I like Apple Leather case but I wouldn't consider that ""protective"" like the others."
Zinc is always my go to. I have never had bad colds while using it.
"The Ritz Reimbursement for airline incidentals is now $300. You also get unlimited lounge club access. You also get 3 club level upgrades at the Ritz each year. If you get the Ritz card it gives you gold status at both Ritz and Marriott. If you then apply for the Marriott card and write down your Marriott number you get an extra 15 elite qualifying nights. Gold status is normally 50 nights at Marriott. Platinum status is normally 75 night at Marriott. 

You will get gold status at both Marriott and Ritz every year you spend 10k on your Ritz Card."
"Alright and last thing, I'll still be able to use my 212 Evo right? No need for a new cooler?"
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!
"If you're buying things like actual hardware, HD has a much better selection, particularly metric. It's nowhere near as good as Ace/True Value type hardware stores of course, but it's certainly better stocked than Lowe's is in that regard."
I've found that Lowes staff know a lot less than Home Depot. When I say know less I mean something as general as knowing where something in the store is. Pricing there the same. Products Like Home Depot better. I used to prefer Lowes simple because it's closer to my house. Now I drive a bit further because I'd rather buy from Home Depot.
"Norwegian here. 
The weather isn't that bad in the south. Think Canada, but less significant."
Odd to see Wonder Woman vs Railblazer not be right next to each other... is one running better than the other or is it a matter of ridership?

Do you have a link to that didgeridoo technique? Or a song name? I don't think I've seen him do that before.
