23477,best car racing video game,"I always loved taking my complete crap car and throwing all the money you could at it, and it was completely useless but so much fun."
11102,best backpack for college,Gotta second this. Mine's still holding up after 13 years.
67743,axios alternatives reddit,We (large company that was just appraised at > 1.5Billion US) released a version that was buggy in IE11 but completely broken in IE10. Not a single complaint about IE10 - plenty of people using IE11 though.
33941,best Pokemon game,"Pok√©mon Black 2 and White 2. 
I haven't played White 2 (the story is the same in both, only changes are the post story content) but I enjoyed Black 2 immensely, and I played it around 5 times"
54399,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Currently have used the zero soft for 2 months, not gonna lie, it's definitely a step above other pads. I haven't found another pad that feels as nice, however, they are absolutely over hyped and expensive. Honestly theres so many brands out there that you could probably find one that comes close."
57413,best water brand,Anyone says anything other than Dasani is simply not from this planet
22695,best celebrity,"I personally saw Bette Midler berate some poor unpaid volunteer at the Sundance Film Festival to tears because this poor girl didn't have enough tickets for Bette's entourage to the hottest movie at the Festival (how many tickets she got was not this girls decision).

She pulled the ""Do you know who I am"" card.

She's a cunt.


EDIT:   WOW.   So much karma for trashing Bette Midler.   [It's a dream come true!](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Spongebob-Rainbow-Of-Imagination-Reaction-Gif.gif)

Thanks everyone.   My only hope is the girl who dealt with her is a redditor and reads this and claims the karma as her own."
21373,best workout music,"My running playlist is basically just all Rob Zombie and Taylor Swift. Going from ""Living Dead Girl"" to ""You Belong with Me"" is a little jarring but has been successful in motivating me."
8255,best toothpaste,"You just tied in an irrelevant argument to this comment.

Kudos."
5755,best programming language for web development,"You should not learn the older versions of HTML and CSS since it might lead to you using redundant code that is not supported by modern browsers. That said, when you learn new things about HTML5 and CSS3, do keep checking for **browser compatibility** since many of the new HTML5 elements aren't fully supported either and it may lead to your code behaving in a different way than intended. Don't get confused. You will understand what it means when you start the learning. :)"
8640,best toothpaste,I would not touch that box of toothpaste with a 20 foot pole.
69203,best major to study in college,"Well, I'm not an engineer.  I consider myself, first and foremost, a designer.  Which means I'm concerned with visuals, user experience, usability, customer research, etc.

I work really closely with a lot of front end devs, and do occasionally help them out when it comes to writing CSS, but it's not a core part of my job by any means.  I'd describe it as a job-applicable hobby.

That said, I'd recommend you give it a shot.  I know someone who went through MCDB in school, thought she was set for a life of working in labs and publishing papers, and then discovered coding.  She's a front end developer now.

Start simple: Codecademy, or Treehouse.  See if it suits you before committing yourself to it fully."
72998,best Linux distro,Thank you.
33698,best electric car,"Battery degradation on everything but the Leaf (bc the Leaf has no thermal management) hasn't been an issue.

Even long distance trips are a non-issue with Teslas, less so with other EVs. 

I have a Mid Range RWD Model 3 and couldn't be happier."
22497,best celebrity,"My mom was hiking in the mountains in Georgia and saw a couple people wearing headsets walking around with some local law enforcement. She thought she'd stumbled upon some crime scene, but it turned out they were a film crew being looked over by the sheriff's department while ""A Walk in the Woods"" was being filmed. She got to meet Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. Both of them were apparently very nice."

4218,best text editor,"Since I mainly work in PowerShell, I've become a big fan of Visual Studio Code. The extension support in VSCode means you get a lightweight editor while still getting Intellisense; the [PowerShell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) even just hit 1.0.

That being said, VSCode is noticeably slower to open than Notepad++. I generally keep Notepad++ installed for opening things like quick text files, config files, etc. and only use VSCode for scripting."

5791,best programming language for web development,"Come on, nobody learns all the languages and Web frameworks out there.  You might as well suggest the guy has to learn Rails, and ASP.NET MVC too, because, hey, there are a lot of jobs for those.

Realistically if you know one MVC framework it's not like another is going to be mind-bending if you actually need to pick up."
9226,best toothpaste,I can't believe there is one in ten disagreeing.
