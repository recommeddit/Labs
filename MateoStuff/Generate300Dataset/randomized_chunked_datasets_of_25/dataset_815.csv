55599,best action and adventure novel series,"i found Wizard's First Rule in a second hand shop, and picked it up a while ago. I've been meaning to give it a go, but have been apprehensive about it, since i had never heard of it before, and the reviews seem to be conflicted. What did you like about it, and what did you think of the writing?"

29777,best money managing app,"I need some advice on how to use YNAB. I used it for 2 years but it really didn't work for me. What am i doing wrong? 

- we'd have a monthly allocation for, say, eating out. But we'd have no idea of how much we had already spent that month. It wasn't until i imported all the credit card transactions at the end of the month that i would know if i was over or not. It didn't influence our spending. (We can't manually enter transactions as we go, hands are full with little kids)

- categorising transactions took ages. Has YNAB got an auto-categorising feature yet? Surely it could suggest a category for ""McDonalds $9.90"". It took a whole night once a month to do, which was just too long and tedious.

Any advice or tips much appreciated."

22964,best celebrity,"I've posted this before, but I once spilled a very large, very colorful, drink on Kate Hudson.

My girlfriend and I ended up in a VIP area at a music festival totally by accident. We weren't supposed to be there but walked right in not knowing it was restricted and since we were there we decided to stay.

We ended up in a corner as to not draw attention to ourselves and I would walk over to the bar occasionally to get us drinks and bring them back. A few hours and more than a few rounds later, my girlfriend decided she had to have one of the plastic yard glasses of Margaritas that they were selling, so I attempted to bring back one and a few beers on my next trip. I made it within ten feet of where we where stationed, when I sidestepped a dancing girl, tripped, and spilled the entire yard glass on a women. When she turned around, I realized that the women that I had just soaked was Kate Hudson. She was incredibly awesome about it, and luckily my girlfriend had an extra shirt with her that she could change into."
