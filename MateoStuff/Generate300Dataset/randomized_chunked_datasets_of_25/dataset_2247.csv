22193,best celebrity,Fat Mike of NOFX was really nice and funny.  He bullshitted with my and my friends before a show one time.
32634,best vacation resort,"Usually you just have to tell them your budget and what you're expecting from the trip. They may give you a few options of places to stay, but they sort it for you. Also, most people tend to have some sort of idea of what they want to do on a vacation. Like, if you're going to Italy, you may know that you want to do a vineyard tour or go horseback riding. If you're going to India, you may know that you absolutely want to see some tigers. You must have just gotten a bad person or someone who wasn't good at communicating."
68465,best science fiction novel,"It's definitely not a masterpiece - and I say this as someone who's bought every book in the series. It's the literary equivalent of a fast food burger - incredibly competent, but no depth or real addition to the genre. I'm happy to read it many times, but more as a pleasant distraction than something that shapes my thought and imagination."
68177,best science fiction novel,"Great to see someone else list Ubik. I remember one my first read and yelling out ‘oh what the hell!’ When I got to the end and my GF popping her head around the corner looking concerned. Got her to start reading it that day. 

Need to re-read it."

22179,best celebrity,"I met Henry Winkler (Fonzie) at a horror/sci-fi convention one year. I told him I loved Happy Days and he immediately went into Fonz mode  and kissed my hand!!                       
He laughed about how he wasn't as popular as the Star Trek celebrities, and told me he was glad he got to see a ""pretty girl"" like me. (Oh gosh~~ :D )           
My boyfriend was paying for the autograph and Henry said that he ""seems like an amazing gentleman who loves you very much."" So even my boyfriend was gushing.. lol."

34972,best NFL player,"!nflcompare <Josh Allen, Aaron Rodgers, Deshawn Watson> [2020]


As a pure passer I would put 2020 Watson above 2020 Allen, Josh's rushing is why I think he edged Watson to be QB#2 for 2020. Deshawn was absurd and probably the greatest case study for why QB wins/losses should not matter that I've seen in a decade. This performance compared to the team performance blew the doors off of the mid 2010s ""lol 7-9 Brees"" meme. Absolutely an elite QB, even if he's a slimy disgusting person."
