32634,"Usually you just have to tell them your budget and what you're expecting from the trip. They may give you a few options of places to stay, but they sort it for you. Also, most people tend to have some sort of idea of what they want to do on a vacation. Like, if you're going to Italy, you may know that you want to do a vineyard tour or go horseback riding. If you're going to India, you may know that you absolutely want to see some tigers. You must have just gotten a bad person or someone who wasn't good at communicating.",best vacation resort

It's the literary equivalent of a fast food burger - incredibly competent, but no depth or real addition to the genre.

He laughed about how he wasn't as popular as the Star Trek celebrities, and told me he was glad he got to see a ""pretty girl"" like me. (Oh gosh~~ :D )

34972,"!nflcompare <Josh Allen, Aaron Rodgers, Deshawn Watson> [2020]


As a pure passer I would put 2020 Watson above 2020 Allen, Josh's rushing is why I think he edged Watson to be QB#2 for 2020. Deshawn was absurd and probably the greatest case study for why QB wins/losses should not matter that I've seen in a decade. This performance compared to the team performance blew the doors off of the mid 2010s ""lol 7-9 Brees"" meme. Absolutely an elite QB, even if he's a slimy disgusting person.",best NFL player
