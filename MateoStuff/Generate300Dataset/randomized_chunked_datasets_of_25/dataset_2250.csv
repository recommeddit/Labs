9105,best toothpaste,"I remember when I was in high school, there was this stupid kid who told everyone he rubbed sensodyne on his penis before he got ""blowjobs"" from his ""girlfriend"" because it made his penis more sensitive, thereby making his ""blowjobs"" feel better.  I shit you not."

11664,best gifts for dad,"I made him a belt when I was 7 or 8 and my mom put me in leather craft. I had this star shaped punch and used it to spell out ""daddy"" which is weird cause I swear I only ever called him ""dad"". Except I was your typical 7 year old and ran out of room, so it looks like:

**

*****

*          *

*           *

*        *

*****

Fuck I can't handle this ascii art I'm too dunk.

Look I ran out of room so the Y is like rediculously thin since i ran out of room.

It's also an ugly tan colour.

It's also back wards (like for a lefty)

Anyways he still wears the damn thing like 30 years later, and it makes me happy whenever I see it

But over the years I've had more than one friend ask if my dad is some sort of pimp since he wears a daddy belt...

Love you dad, you're my hero!"

14987,best romantic novel,"I'm a total sucker for Lisa Kleypas's Wallflower and Hathaway series. 

Anything by Ilona Andrews (Kate Daniels is my addiction) & Shelly Laurenston (Pride Series and her new Call of Crows) are absolute winners. Humorous, charming, well written and smoking hot.

32867,best free online grammar checker,"Grammarly premium is a good tool and probably a better solution than the competitors.

I found [ProWritingAid](https://www.writinghelp.net/pro-writing-aid/) a better and cheaper solution.
