From what I could find online, though, it appears that Pardontax is exactly the same as any other decent toothpaste like Colgate Total, with the same set of active ingredients. If you hate the taste, id recommend switching to something you like. Enjoying the activity will make you far more likely to brush for longer, and more often, and that will make a far larger difference than the toothpaste you use.",best toothpaste

67892,"I could not read it either - not until I listened to a course on it - I believe it was from the Teaching Company. 

Basically, it told you the story ahead of time and what the writer was trying to do. It also told me the outline of the chapter names that are not included in the book. 

Once I realized the parallels with The Odyssey- and that each chapter is intentionally written in a different style (chapter 3 for example is a literal free-flowing read of what the main character is thinking while walking along a beach) the book made a lot more sense. 

Trying to read it blind was just frustrating. Understanding what it is about, and what it relates to makes in much easier to get through.",best science fiction novel

In my opinion, he would have killed in India too. He was just that good. You can't have an average that's almost double of any other great player of every era without actually being that good. A century can be a fluke; an average of 100 isn't.",best cricket teams of all time

Its feels like a good mousepad for the like first 2 months of use then it wears out + the inconsistency is cherry on top, honestly one of the worst pads you can buy for the price

70576,"I mean, depends on what you consider ""soon"" after graduating and what you consider ""too many years"" in school. It depends greatly on the area and cost of living, too. I have several friends who are accountants who bank six figures and graduated in 2014. However, they work in public accounting, which is very hectic work schedules for about a third of the year and are great at what they do in big firms.

Then again, you need 150 hours to qualify to sit for the CPA exams, which public accounting will probably require to hire you, so...again, depends on your expectations.",best major to study in college
