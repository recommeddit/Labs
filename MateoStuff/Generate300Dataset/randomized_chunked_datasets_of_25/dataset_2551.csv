12496,best gifts for mom,"My sister got married last year. Thanks to that, our family finally had some decent pictures altogether (we don't have many) so I used the nicest one of us 4 (includes my dad of course lol) and made it into a large canvas that she can put on the wall

Mum AND dad REALLY liked that. Was so chuffed."
5153,best home improvement store,"Recently Lowes has better curbside pickup, good luck with Home Depotâ€™s"
42216,movies like Inception,"Pro-tip. If you don't know what version you're watching, start the movie and wait for the voice over. If there *is* a voiceover, immediately pause the film, mute it, and play it muted until you see Kiefer Sutherland. Then unmute and enjoy."
8825,best toothpaste,"I don't know why your comment is being downvoted without explanation. 

From what I could find online, though, it appears that Pardontax is exactly the same as any other decent toothpaste like Colgate Total, with the same set of active ingredients. If you hate the taste, id recommend switching to something you like. Enjoying the activity will make you far more likely to brush for longer, and more often, and that will make a far larger difference than the toothpaste you use."

67892,best science fiction novel,"I could not read it either - not until I listened to a course on it - I believe it was from the Teaching Company. 

Basically, it told you the story ahead of time and what the writer was trying to do. It also told me the outline of the chapter names that are not included in the book. 

Once I realized the parallels with The Odyssey- and that each chapter is intentionally written in a different style (chapter 3 for example is a literal free-flowing read of what the main character is thinking while walking along a beach) the book made a lot more sense. 

Trying to read it blind was just frustrating. Understanding what it is about, and what it relates to makes in much easier to get through."
34675,best NFL player,Michael Irvin is 3rd all time in playoff yards despite having less games than the rest of the top 10. The disrespect is ridiculous. He played in the hardest era for receivers due to rules and talent at CB.

* Trigun
* Samurai Champloo 
* Death Note
* Eureka Seven"
25394,best cricket teams of all time,"He didn't. India toured Aus and his avg in that series was over 150. This is an article which discusses what avg he might have had in India if he had toured.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, he would have killed in India too. He was just that good. You can't have an average that's almost double of any other great player of every era without actually being that good. A century can be a fluke; an average of 100 isn't."
19572,best YouTube video,I love that they only reason they go in is to get something Leroy needs.
23835,best car racing video game,"Honestly? Nothing on Switch really matches what you're looking for. 

If you're not limited to your Switch, the PC Xbox game pass is 1 buck for the first month these days (you can unsub anytime) and has Forza Horizon 4/Forza 7."
54632,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"As G640 owner dont buy it, shitty durability. Because its affected by temperature one day it can feel like a average pad the next day it can turn into pad that has incredibly inconsitent slides (mud pad in the middle, kinda normal on the sides for example)

Its feels like a good mousepad for the like first 2 months of use then it wears out + the inconsistency is cherry on top, honestly one of the worst pads you can buy for the price

Zero (XL) is rn in stock in both MID and xSOFT, theres not any noticable difference between getting MID or xSOFT instead of SOFT from what Ive heard"

44816,best items under $100,"I bought a coffee machine in March for $40 plus a container of crushed for $10. I have saved so much money from making coffee at home, its crazy! Dont get me wrong I still give in to buying Tims donuts every once in awhile"
53588,best medicine for a cold,"I agree

This is not the case here, however. It just didn't cross his mind that he's putting everyone with kids at risk."

35913,best alcoholic drink,What a fucking dork.
4711,best home improvement store,"Home depot for rough materials, Lowes for finish work."
38117,best Marvel movie,"Admittedly I did have fun for most of it but by the time it climaxed with >!that third-rate-network-sitcom-level ""dance-off"" moment and then some purple CGI goop!< I was like ""How did they trick me into paying to see this?"" But I heard on the commentaries how about much Griffin and David revel in these films so it's not like I think anyone who likes them is an idiot."
8413,best toothpaste,Here in Australia 9/10 dentist recommend that stuff.

72520,best keyboard switches,"I've been gaming on blues for nearly a year now. It feels so good. I have a board with Gateron Browns and one with MX Browns and I can't imagine gaming on anything but my Blues. Well, I can easily image it. The Gateron Browns are actually super smooth and would technically be a better choice, but I like my blues. They're fun."
33758,best electric car,I think range is pretty good nowadays. I agree about the lack of charging stations.
70576,best major to study in college,"I mean, depends on what you consider ""soon"" after graduating and what you consider ""too many years"" in school. It depends greatly on the area and cost of living, too. I have several friends who are accountants who bank six figures and graduated in 2014. However, they work in public accounting, which is very hectic work schedules for about a third of the year and are great at what they do in big firms.

Then again, you need 150 hours to qualify to sit for the CPA exams, which public accounting will probably require to hire you, so...again, depends on your expectations."
