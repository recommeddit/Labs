Thanks for this. They have added Hotspot access to the Total Wireless plans. 10gb I believe.
"man, I love some of those styles but idk if I could eat the cost. Are they really solid?"
This whole thing is just super weird.
I tested this the other day with my standard fish tank ph test kit. I filter the water through the brita for my small fish tank the water that comes out of my tap is quite basic and disgusting.. Interestingly after I tested the filtered water it was yellowish indicating the water was then slightly acidic after filtration. It definitely does something...

"An acquaintaince of mine who used to work in insurance told me most of the bite claims he saw were for Golden Retrievers.

The problem is likely that they have such a good reputation that people think they can let the kid just do whatever to the dog."

Yea this is true and you'd be surprised the percent of people that still use those browsers or mobile browsers. I'm not saying don't use fetch but some people would prefer to work with an axios http client API rather than the fetch API as well.
