32080,"Art Hotel in Barcelona. I was the hostess on a 2 day city trip some pharma sales people had won. I was so stressed I didn't fully enjoy it (these were high profile people of a very important client, I also adored them they were really good people and I wanted things to be perfect for them) but: the pool was amazing, the breakfast buffet was delicious, the bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. They have candies and chocolates all over the place for free.

One day, I will go back.",best hotel to live in

68647,"Sad to see the Black Ocean: Mobius series by J. S. Morin isn't anywhere on these lists! (not that I've seen yet anyways). Awesome firefly-esk feel, with wizards, and an amazingly deep universe. There's 2 spinoff series (Mercy for hire; Astral prime) based off the original that really delve into the universe and its characters. Highly recommend it to anyone",best science fiction novel

37044,"Yeah I definitely agree with you that Scream is a fantastic ride. Very nice elements and a lot of action. But it has seen better times and the dozen punches to the head are a unforgivable deal breaker for me. Same goes for Riddler. Batman however was tolerable, I have to admit that. I very much appreciate that modern coasters tend to get away from over head restraints and try to give the rider a free experience around his head.


Thrill is in fact something we see seldomly in Europe. But as I said, I'd now say that I prefer themeing over thrill.",best roller coaster at six flags
