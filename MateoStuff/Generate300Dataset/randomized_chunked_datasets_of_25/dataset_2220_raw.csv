"Thanks for the link.

I knew about that list, but chose not to use it (because it's shounen heavy, like you say).  And one of my goals was to have an alternative to the shounen heavy lists."
"I like Mesa Verde for creative, delicious vegetarian food."
"As a big Marvel fan, I think all of them are worth watching except Incredible Hulk. Beyond that it comes down to preference. A lot of people don’t like the first two Thor movies, I don’t like the Ant-man movies much, but pretty much all of them have good qualities and contribute something important to the overall narrative arc."

+1 for enter the matrix specifically... I'd give more up votes if I could for the plethora of other games on this list that are fantastic
"Why is this a huge mistake? I painted the east-west walls red, and the north-south walls orange... I'm also completely colourblind."
"Eh, I'm not sure that's entirely true. I've had both Ray-Bans and Oliver Peoples (currently only have the former), and I still found the Oliver Peoples to be of a higher quality. The primary difference I noticed was that the hinge on the Oliver Peoples was much more substantial and protective of the glasses' shape. Then of course there was the fact that from a design perspective, I think Oliver Peoples blows Ray-Bans out of the water. 

However, to the question, I'm still not sure those differences are worth the price jump, but I understand people who would rather have the Oliver Peoples (myself included) for the quality bump and the (in my opinion) better design."
Well.. I'm delirious. You're right.
Still chugging along with my iPhone 7 from November 2016.
This should be a forum sticky. Could you maybe group them by product type?
Ive been wanting a dog for about 20 years now. Still wishing.

I have not had that issue with any of the matte screen protectors that I’ve tried.

"Thanks! Yeah, there seems to be a lot of people in this thread that enjoy Ultron. I can't say I'm one of them haha. To me, Ultron was always the worst Avengers movie and I don't feel there's anything you're missing storywise without it except for maybe the introduction of some new characters which are easily explained during the exposition in Civil War."
Wait for this to release in late August:  [https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/a4371716](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/a4371716)
"I'll second that - at three months too much time away wouldn't have been relaxing for me - later on, absolutely, but not at 3m."
I agree with you and also play the trumpet... I hate it when sax player play with there thousands of keys and we have 3
"He's just trying to be the best friend he can be, man."
"Yeah absolutely and that's what I'm doing, but generally speaking I can see how this would appeal to some people."
"Hardiness zone 4 is good for most magnolias. I don't recommend it since it flowers early then doesn't look great in front of everything else after, but the climate is rarely an issue."

"> I will point out, though, that RavPower is one of several brands that Amazon removed all listings for

They're still on Amazon. All they did is rename themselves to iSmart, remove all mentions of RavPower from their product nomenclature.

Aukey might be *Oriental Hero* on the big rainforest (unlike the real place, which is fast becoming a savannah…)"
