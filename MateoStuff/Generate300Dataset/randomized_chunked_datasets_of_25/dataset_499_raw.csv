"Better yet, plant two saplings and watch as the anticipation to use the hammock grows."
"You are kinda out of luck if you are looking for a single good source. You need to piece together articles on specific topics to see the truth and examine the bias. Some have mentioned the Economist, but it is important to know they embody the very definition of liberal, meaning open up everything to everyone to make their own choices, essentially a more pragmatic libertarianism than we see in the States. If you are looking for straight facts and no analyses you can look at the Associated Press, very good for factual details but can be a little shallow on understanding and context. I like to use Feedly to pull articles from various sources and read articles on the same topic to get a better understanding of the subject. It aggregates everything together pretty nicely for comparative reading."
"FT is further from campus but if you get a bike then that's completely fine. You share a bathroom with one other dorm which is a huge+, especially if you get chill people who you share the bathroom with too. In biased because I lived in FT my freshman year, but FT is the best dorm.

Also, FT = Santa Catalina"
"As a 90s Indian kid, this brings tears to my eyes. 

Also, since 70s every decade has been dominated by a different team which is pleasantly surprising."
And a dubious interest in things that allegedly cause cancer

Not suitable for all depending on individual medical history."

"i have basically the same setup, and it works great for my use. 

used to charge pixel 4 xl, nitecore nu25 and garmin inreach mini. on very conservative power settings on all devices, with moderate to heavy use of phone and inreach, i expect to be able to go for 5-6 full days with this setup."
Ritz Kyoto and Conrad Osaka are both pretty amazing.
I'd say that phish food is slightly better but half baked is also very good

"Naxos is my signature (right now) too haha. But I love Carlisle ‚Äî‚Äî imagine my heartbreak when my wife recently said ‚Äúewww what are you wearing, you smell like an old lady‚Äù ü•∫üò≠"

"He's washed up, but probably doesn't care because $$$."
"Robert Downey, Jr. 
Met him a long time ago when he was filming U.S. Marshalls. He is just a really nice guy. 

(on a side note, went out of my way to search for Tommy Lee Jones at the same time, finally caught up to him, and he was a complete prick)"

Modern mainstream music isnt going to cut it for me working out, or otherwise!"
"I got it on sale last year, and was about 80% sure I would hate it and quit playing. Turn based combat has never really been my thing and I generally don't go for japanese-style games. I was wrong. I don't even know why I loved that game, but I'm so glad i gave it a shot."
"I've been several times. It's good. The houses are not the scariest I've done, but they are fun and they pay a decent amount if attention to detail. And the scare zones are all good. They put a lot of effort in to the scare actors, costumes and makeup, and the whole in the woods thing adds a lot of atmosphere to the whole thing. They also used to do an excellent end of night show at the theater near France. Not sure if they did it last year or will do it this year, but it was always good.

However, Kings Dominion at least used to be better. Their scare zones were just better and really tried to scare people. Their houses/trails weren't any better than BGW's, really, but the scare zones put them over the top and they really took advantage of the more open spaces for them."
"For historicals no one beats Mary Balogh!

I also really like Karen Marie Moning and then if you want it super steamy and paranormal Emma Holly is your girl. 

Kresley Cole‚Äôs Professional series is excellent contemporary bdsm romance."
