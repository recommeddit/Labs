One Christmas o managed to find an importer who would get me a box of the candy bars.  She started to ball her eyes out when she opened the gift. My brother's just looked at me like ""thanks a lot asshole."" She got some cool gifts that year but getting a bit of her childhood in yummy wafer form killed it.

Don’t get me wrong she’s had some funny moments and memorable quotes, but I don’t like her personality, even during the early seasons with the Scott drama, whilst I’m not backing Scott, I couldn’t route for her, as I felt she was very toxic too, and her pregnancies were clearly not what Scott wanted and she didn’t care. He was in no position, mentally or otherwise, to have another kid, and she was like well I want one so oops I’m pregnant, deal with it",best Kardashian
