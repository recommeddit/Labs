35536,"I can think of at least a hundred places that sell vanilla ice cream within 20 miles of my house. You don't have to jump on a plane to Prague to get it, man.

**edit:** for everybody who took me and my claims of 100 places seriously, most convenience stores in Austin (or around Texas and California, from my experience) have a small freezer in them that sell pints of ice cream. On top of that, every grocery store sells vanilla ice cream. There are ice cream shops and restaurants everywhere, and I challenge you to find a restaurant with a dessert menu that doesn't have vanilla ice cream. I can deduce that if given a 20 mile radius of Austin, TX, I could find at least 100 locations that sell vanilla ice cream.",best alcoholic drink
