5458,best home improvement store,Home Depot is closer so I go there 90% of the time. From what I can tell they both carry pretty much the same stuff and prices are similar. If Lowe's was closer I would go there instead.

35536,best alcoholic drink,"I can think of at least a hundred places that sell vanilla ice cream within 20 miles of my house. You don't have to jump on a plane to Prague to get it, man.

**edit:** for everybody who took me and my claims of 100 places seriously, most convenience stores in Austin (or around Texas and California, from my experience) have a small freezer in them that sell pints of ice cream. On top of that, every grocery store sells vanilla ice cream. There are ice cream shops and restaurants everywhere, and I challenge you to find a restaurant with a dessert menu that doesn't have vanilla ice cream. I can deduce that if given a 20 mile radius of Austin, TX, I could find at least 100 locations that sell vanilla ice cream."

34073,best NFL player,"I always feel dirty comparing the two. While Don Hutson was definitely the more dominant player during his time, it was a completely different era. Both were excellent, but they really played a different game so I can't really see how anyone can say that one was better than the other."
