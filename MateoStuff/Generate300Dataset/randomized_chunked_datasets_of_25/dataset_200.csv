If I’m going out to dinner and I’m going to get comfort food (99% of the time) I’ll get a beer or hard cider, usually local to my area but I also like angry orchard.

If I’m in the mood I’ll get a mixed cocktail, usually some variation of a rum punch or an margarita.

If I’m drinking to get drunk vodka crans all the way.",best alcoholic drink

49211,"Went will Dell 2721. Got it for about $404. Just seemed to be the best overall. After reading reviews and what others were saying I rank them..Dell, then Lenovo Legion, then all the LGs. All of them are very solid and seem to have good quality control. I like the 165hz on the Dell and the colors seems to be solid as well. It has a nicer design and stand than the Lenovo. LG overall isn't as speced as good as the Dell or Lenovo but still very similar.

There is also an MSI monitor that has gotten some attention as being really good as well but not a ton of reviews on it. That said, from what I have heard it is really hit and miss. Bad quality control on it. And seems like a risky buy right now. .",best gaming monitor

60272,"Honestly, just look for US made.  I know that sounds nationalistic, but they're all buying from a few manufacturers, and the US made models tend to be better in relation to their overall craftsmanship in terms of part quality and overall longevity.  

As another user said, avoid frost free; while it's a nice benefit to not have to thaw your freezer occasionally, it creates another point of failure and can cause issues with temperature variation.  Also, VACUUM YOUR FREEZER'S COILS AND ACCESSIBLE PARTS.  This will improve the longevity more than nearly anything else.  Oh, also, try to get one with a metal interior.  Many cheapos are made today with plastic linings that will crack over time.",best freezer brand
