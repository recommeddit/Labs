71315,best movies with a cool twist,"Hey I got my first silver, thank you stranger!"
36679,best alcoholic drink,"It depends on what my goals are.

If I’m going out to dinner and I’m going to get comfort food (99% of the time) I’ll get a beer or hard cider, usually local to my area but I also like angry orchard.

If I’m in the mood I’ll get a mixed cocktail, usually some variation of a rum punch or an margarita.

If I’m drinking to get drunk vodka crans all the way."
49123,best gaming monitor,"Anyone using Benq? I mostly see LG, ASUS and Dell in comments here. As far as I have known and heard - Benq produces one of the best monitors for 144, 4K and another designer monitors. Any comments?"

49211,best gaming monitor,"Went will Dell 2721. Got it for about $404. Just seemed to be the best overall. After reading reviews and what others were saying I rank them..Dell, then Lenovo Legion, then all the LGs. All of them are very solid and seem to have good quality control. I like the 165hz on the Dell and the colors seems to be solid as well. It has a nicer design and stand than the Lenovo. LG overall isn't as speced as good as the Dell or Lenovo but still very similar.

There is also an MSI monitor that has gotten some attention as being really good as well but not a ton of reviews on it. That said, from what I have heard it is really hit and miss. Bad quality control on it. And seems like a risky buy right now. ."

40280,best midrange CPU,"11400F is an absurdly good CPU for the price. In gaming it just about matches the 5600x, and it's half the cost. Pair with any B560, but preferably B560 Pro4 or B560M Pro-VDH."
40140,best Chrome extensions,"The ones I use on a daily basis or useful ones that I occasionally use:

* uBlock origin - ad-blocker
* Dark Reader - universally converts light pages to dark ones
* Violentmonkey - a better version of tampermonkey (which lets you run custom scripts on webpages).
* Imagus - shows full-res images in an inline popup when I hover over an image
* RES (and mod toolbox)
* Windscribe - VPN
* Join, for connecting my phone and sharing my clipboard between my PC and my phone, or quickly sending links/files between them
* Lastpass - password manager
* CrxcrxMouse - lets me draw gestures by holding right-click and moving the mouse, and lets me close/reopen tabs, etc. without much movement
* Keepa - amazon price history and tracking, embedded right on the page of each item I view
* Honey - searches for coupon codes and automatically enters them in the promo/coupon code box when I'm buying something online and am at the checkout page
* Project Naptha - lets me select text that is embedded in images
* Turn off the Lights - on youtube, it dims everything outside of the video, and adds a little ambilight-style glow around the video that changes dynamically with the vid"
60272,best freezer brand,"Honestly, just look for US made.  I know that sounds nationalistic, but they're all buying from a few manufacturers, and the US made models tend to be better in relation to their overall craftsmanship in terms of part quality and overall longevity.  

As another user said, avoid frost free; while it's a nice benefit to not have to thaw your freezer occasionally, it creates another point of failure and can cause issues with temperature variation.  Also, VACUUM YOUR FREEZER'S COILS AND ACCESSIBLE PARTS.  This will improve the longevity more than nearly anything else.  Oh, also, try to get one with a metal interior.  Many cheapos are made today with plastic linings that will crack over time."
11177,best backpack for college,"My 2¢ would be to buy from a company that gives a lifetime warrantee on their products, specifically zippers and seams. That would be something to look for.

My own positive experience with a company who offers such a warrantee has been with [Arc'teryx](http://www.arcteryx.com/Product.aspx?EN/Mens/Packs)."

I almost went with BH because they were always mentioned on the SPI podcast i listen to, but I really liked how Siteground has the 30 day money back deal and had good reviews on here.  6 months into siteground now and have no regrets yet, good quality and good price"
