53522,"Please don’t be so quick to blame ‘lazy doctors.’ My co-worker had a medical board complaint filed against her because she didn’t give a child with sniffles for 2 days a script for amoxicillin. Antibiotic overuse and  resistance is driven in large part by patients. Sure the prescriber should be firm, but I’ve had shorter visits for mild heart failure and pneumonia than for explaining to a patient why they didn't need levaquin “which always works for them” for their nasal congestion they developed as they were driving by the clinic. I’ve luckily been mostly successful in explaining why antibiotics aren’t necessary but public education needs to carry some of the load.",best medicine for a cold

Start with a one quart mason jar. Use canning funnel kind of like this.

Then add instant oats about halfway, dry milk to the 2/3 mark, a dash of sugar, and then a bunch of raisins--leave about 10% space at the top. Lastly add cinnamon and dry vanilla powder to taste plus a pinch of salt.

Then cap and shake until it's well mixed. Store on a shelf and shake out a little into a bowl each day at breakfast. Add boiling water. By the time a coffee press is ready the oatmeal is also ready to eat. One batch lasts me 7 days.",best breakfast foods

22426,"Terry Pratchett was as quirky and fun in real life as his books were.  His passing was a huge loss to me as we'd met several times in person and had multiple conversations online.  Felt like I'd lost a friend.

We met Robin Williams at Universal Studios when my wife's Grandmother was still alive.  She said hello to him and hoped his family was having a good time.  He tipped his hat to her and said ""Thank you kindly, Ma'am"".  She talked about that encounter the rest of her days.  In real life he was super short as well.

And, finally, Tim Hunkin who you've probably never heard of but he did a popular TV show in the 90s called The Secret Life of Machines.  I sent him an e-mail thanking him for helping me become interested in electronics and I got a very kind reply back.",best celebrity

-
Nurse Jackie
McMafia 
Morning Show
Big Little Lies
Your Honor - 2021 Brian Cranson (there are a few shows with the same name)

Im currently watching Snowfall. Excellent show, About the drug world in the 80's in LA.

22135,">Perhaps there are loads of them who get stuck in these roles/images which are not at all reflective of their actual nature, simply due to the fact that they are forced to make a viable career out of what they have chosen to do.
