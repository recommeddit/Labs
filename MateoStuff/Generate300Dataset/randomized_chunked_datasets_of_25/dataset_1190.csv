30177,"In Texas, we were taught that it was partially to ""save"" Texas. Texas just won its independence, but Mexico didn't accept it. The US comes to save the day while trying to annex Texas into the union (and then take some more land when it came to a peace treaty). In my college history classes, they were more blunt about it being an act of ""manifest destiny"" where the US saw everything West of its borders as inherently theirs and the Mexican-American War was a result of that. There was also a growing issue around slavery and southern states knew they could add Texas as a slave state, along with possibly more slave states with the additional land.",best Mexican war to study

9873,"I bought one last week. Their 10000mAh usb-c version. Disappointingly, if I use a cable with usb-c on both ends, it's ph-1 charging the battery, not the logical direction. 

I need to use the supplied usb-A to micro-usc cable with the also supplied micro-usb-c adapter to charge the phone properly. While ph-1 reports ""charging"" or ""charging slowly"" on the lock screen, the overall charging speed is not too bad (about 2.5 hours for 10-90%). 

Wondering if direct usb-c charging were working, will be faster?

22106,"Kevin Hart

I worked retail in early 2011, and there was this guy who needed some clothes shipped to Atlanta, and I hooked him up with a surprise discount, and he was grateful. He then asked what I was doing that night, I said  nothing, and the guy introduced himself ""I'm Nate, I'm Kevin Hart's manager, he's performing tonight, here's my card, I'll get you in for free.""

So I go that night, thinking I'm just going to go watch the show, but Nate sees me, bring to the VIP Lounge where Kevin and 2 other opening comics are drinking Ciroc & Pineapple Juice, and Kevin was the chillest dude, really nice, talked about Philly, comedy, etc., and the show was basically his 'Let Me Explain' material. 

Mind you, this was early 2011, so it was right before he took off, but it was still cool.

57170,"It's marketed as a fancy luxury brand here. It's one of the earlier bottled water brands here from before people commonly drank bottled water in the US, so it kind of developed a stereotype of bring something upper class people drank. Bottled water was for country clubs and spas, not normal people. Plus it used to come in fancy glass bottles. 

Now it comes in normal plastic bottles but is still more expensive than domestic brands. At a gas station a regular bottle Evian might be $2, whereas you can get a bigger bottle of a domestic brand for $1. I'd say it still has some connotations of being an upper class beverage and someone might gently tease you if it was the only thing you drank or your preferred brand.",best water brand
