"FT is almost a mile from campus, so if you enjoy biking. It's only a 10 minute or less bike ride though.

I have no experience in ft but they just rebuilt the dining room there so maybe it's better?"
"Playing guitar is the second best way to get laid. First being roofies, obv."
"Technical Writing/Interactive Media Production major

Best: Potential jobs are very in-demand (UX/UI Designer, Technical Writer, etc), I get to double-dip with the extended major into TW and IMP classes, not a lot of reading required, but not a lot of math either, and it’s in a STEM field. Also, there are enough upper-division credits to not need extra classes on top of the major. 

Worst: There aren’t really any bad things I can come up with at this point."
The only iOS one I’ve played is Dead Cells. I mean it’s not a platformer per se but it has a lot of platforming.
The whole system needs a complete overhaul. I am going to graduate in a few months and the only thing I've learnt is how to pass exams.
"Mustafa - When Smoke Rises is r&b-ish but pretty incredible. amazing sampha feature and production from frank dukes/jamie xx/james blake/etc

They need to stop feeling disappointed in you.
"That it does, but the winds of change are blowing, I think. Most of our authors are self-pub and there's just no beating the ease to publish that Amazon provides for a newbie. However, the hybrid imprints are figuring things out and getting better every day. I have faith that Portal or Wraithmarked or someone will figure out a direct distribution channel to the niche but voracious readers of LitRPG at some point."
Am reading ;-)
"Any recommendations on good ones that don’t distort images and colors by much. I like everything about them, I’m just worried about the color quality"
Interesting. TIL
"Lol that makes way more sense for me, thanks. 

Yea, most certainly am not at the professional level. Got my ice cream maker for free. It's pretty old and didn't have a manual. Doesn't matter because ice cream.

So, the tasso ham?"
"Thank you for your input all. Before posting I had my eye on Arch Linux and after looking at all suggestions and reasoning I think for now I will go this way. 

Linux from Scratch may be a little too far for me and my time restraints although I would have liked too. But the Arch Wiki does look good and a lot of people seem to use and rate. So this for the moment is my choice."
Oh. My sarcasm detector appears to be broken this evening.
"I keep considering switching from vim to VSCode, but I always end up wasting time removing "":w"" from all my files."
"The other great thing about the Sazerac is that when you bring the fixin's to a party, you fulfill the obligation to bring booze, but nobody wants to drink your booze.

Rye whiskey and absinthe? Who the fuck brings *that* to a party? Me, that's who."
"You joke, but some folks pack blank-firing starter pistols (TSA treats them just like firearms) for this exact reason."
"My dentist told me that toothpaste is a minor part of the process and the real cleaning comes from the brushing.

My grandfather died at 86 with all of his teeth. He only ever used baking-soda, water, and a toothbrush."
"I'm with you there on taste.  

So many hate on Dasani.  I've no problems with it.

Funny how people are so different."
"Don't get a pet if you don't want to take care of one.

Instead sign her up to volunteer at the animal shelter every week."
...are these like a cheap rip off of British Maltesers? Cause Maltesers are amazing.
"He did an interview where he said fans ask him to tell them to fuck off, and they both leave happy"
Mines probably Aguardiente. Big Ghost is just really consistent on it and Crimeapple shines throughout.
