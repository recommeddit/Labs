25351,"1. None of them really, but I’ll say Tobey Maguire.  He felt the most accurate.

2. Tom Holland.  Love his jokes and enthusiasm as Spidey.  

3. Andrew Garfield.  Love his spider-like movements

4. Andrew Garfield, no question.  That opening to his second movie was great.

5. Toney Maguire. Harry, Jameson, Aunt May...all great.

6. Andrew Garfield.  His reactions to Uncle Ben / Gwen dying are so emotional.  

7. Tobey Maguire.  He had good character development each movie.

8.  Probably Maguire for Spider-Man 2, but I do have a lot of fun with Homecoming

9. Andrew Garfield, for the death of Gwen Stacy

10. Andrew Garfield for the ASM2 theme

11. Tom Holland.  I love his performances, just hate the writing for his movies.  He would make a perfect traditional Spider-Man.",best spiderman actor
