I didnt love the film but the twist was great.
"I don't really know what clipping is, but Monster sounds different to me each time I hear it on different speakers/headphones."
Oh no looks like it’s no longer on Netflix. But still I recommend you find and watch it. About a woman who pretended to be a victim of 9/11 https://usa.newonnetflix.info/info/70271699/s
My favorite one is the argeneau series by Lynsay Sands!

"I did. I think I might be one of the few that got one that isn't new. Mine was shipped without any box or like wrapped or anything (the case was wrapped by bubble wrap. There was no plastic cover or anything of the sort.

Might just be a  mistake, and I'll be contacting them tomorrow :)"
Hiked up Cascade Mountain at Lake Placid a few weeks ago. Pretty incredible view and all the rock scrambling made the ascent a lot of fun.
"Mercedes eqv & evito, Nissan evalia, PSA's vans... None of them are sold over there."
I think I vaped this flavour a few years ago
I disagree with you but I respect your passion. Half baked all the way
"Intellisense is pretty good. I find that JetBrains stuff just flows more nicely as I type than visual studio does though.

Command line editor completions used to all be laughable and more often than not just got in your way. I haven’t done much evaluation of them since language server picked up steam, I admit."
Make up your mind!
"You're welcome! There are some bumps along the way (I think after Sorkin left it took a bit to find their footing again) but it is definitely one of the best shows ever scripted, up there with The Wire,(which isn't on Netflix unfortunately) a show that doesn't insult your inteligence and is a great drama to boot.

And as I mentioned above, Gilmore Girls just isn't all it's cracked up to be in my opinion. I say this because a lot of people praise it and its dialouge. It starts off strong but the repetitiveness and staleness of the writing begins to show after awhile. I think I dropped out after season 2. Maybe my hopes were too high. (Also I hated all the characters except a few side ones, so that may have had something to do with it lol)"
Supermassive Black Hole- Muse
This!
I picked up a bottle several months back after someone mentioned it on Reddit.  Damn it's good and a little splash is all you need.  That stuff can take bland rice and really make it sing.  Gotta love MSG when used right.
"[Leifheit clothes drying rack](https://www.amazon.ca/Leifheit-Varioline-Winged-Clothes-Adjustable/dp/B00MEXLU3C). Saw my sister using one (she lives in EU). She's super picky about her housewares so I figure this one, while pricier than most, is probably gonna be buy for life kinda thing. I used to dry my clothes on hangers on a garment rack. The Leifheit I feel is better for hanging all sorts of things where you don't want that ""hanger bump"" like tees and sweaters. I only use my dryer once a week now, for towels. Everything else gets dried on the LH rack. 

Alterations on blazers, coats or pants done by a tailor. I'm short so it's really hard to find clothes that fit off the rack. So worth the time and money to make those sleeves and pant legs fit properly. 

Athleta work out leggings. Comes in lengths (petites, regular, talls, crops, 7/8, full) so it's easy to find one that works for you. Good fit & quality, customer service. It's a B corp. Lots of the products are made from recycled content. They only ship in the US. In the before times I'd ship to a mailbox just south of our border, and pick up, so save the silly brokerage/customs charges. 

A properly fitted and constructed pair of work out shoes. My current pair is NB Minimus. I don't understand people who work out in Converse or fashion sneakers. 

Good cold weather accessories. Like a good merino beanie. Mine's from MEC. I use a sweater de-piller to freshen it up every now and then. Also Smart Wool gloves. Oh! and wool socks from Darn Tuff. Can't say enough good things about them. Life time guarantee.

Organizers of any kind, for drawers, for the medicine cabinet, closet, pantry, laundry room. Matching within the whole house is hard, as I usually snag sets when on sale, but within one closet or drawer, a set makes it look more $."
Was that shane dawsons video?
"Oh, Switch has not many games?  That wouldn't be a very good thing.  And well it would surely be nice if the games do not look very bad. Even though it is mainly for my kid, graphics do matter to a degree."
No big deal except the OP said no fish.
So what’s your point? We shouldn’t be ranking clubs based only on how many times they won the CL.
"Was always wondering what this genre was called, it's what they used for DDR, right?"
"Any recommendations for games like the room series, house of Davinci or monument valley? Finished these and need a new one. Thanks in advance"
Pedo poo-bear?
Thought we were talking about test XIs? Neither of these teams can face a moving / seaming / spinning ball.
