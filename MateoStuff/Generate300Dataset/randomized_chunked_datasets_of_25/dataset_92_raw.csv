You're thinking of TLOP. This is in regards to Kendrick's album.

"They're basically using Riverside and San Bernadino tap water, which is horrible."
"Well, I guess we are on the same wavelength. I already have the Anker PowerCore 20100. I was hoping for something as powerful, but even lighter and easier to pack. It seems I have my answer."
"My experience is that has come down more to the individual store regardless of which chain. Gotten really good service and advice from both but also received really bad service and advice from both. Same goes for Menards. You can definitely use the stores against each other to take advantage of price matching.

The negatives of the big box stores is that the quality of the products aren't going to be quite as good as a specialty store. For example, sprinkler and irrigation parts might be sold by the same brands (Toro, Hunter, Rainbird,etc) as the parts at a SiteOne or online via Sprinklerwarehouse.com, but the models are usually one or two versions behind the most recent.  

And for gardening/lawn Care, buying bulk mulch/topsoil/rock is usually about half the cost if you find a landscape supplier or garden nursery. We have had good luck with annuals and a few perennial plants from Lowe's. However, I'd recommend to never buy grass seed from a big box retailer."
"Hotel Xcaret in Mexico. It was listed in Times Magazine as one the top 100 placed to travel in 2018. It also has the only Michelin star chef in Mexico. We liked it so much, we just booked our second trip."
Completely agree. Disney is usually the king here but Universal takes the top spot this decade.

Omg awesome!! They had so many beautiful evergreens when I went. I will definitely check that out and take another visit. :)
This is a weird comment to down vote.
Not seeing Race for the Galaxy is kinda disheartening :(

It's repetitive and redundant.

"I always say start at the front because, being at the front, they‚Äôre the easiest coasters to get to so people gravitate to them. So that should get them out of the way quick üëçüèº Have a good time at the park! I grew up going there so it holds a special place in my heart molding me into this coaster maniac. It‚Äôs not a pretty park, but it has quite a unique collection!

I‚Äôll also add, Revolution and Viper are on the left side (next to X2 and Tatsu) and usually don‚Äôt get too long of lines. Revolution shouldn‚Äôt since i don‚Äôt believe they run VR anymore, so those you could skip in the first run and return to later. X2 and Tatsu are much more pressing."

Totally agree. His production quality and research are absolutely top notch. I can't get enough. Dude needs a Netflix deal.
