5150,best home improvement store,"Agree with this. Every time I go to Lowes they're always very helpful and it's easy to find someone. I never get that great of consumer service at Home Depot, even when buying large purchases like appliances."
67036,best places to skydive in california,Perris is where a lot of pro teams train out of and the clubhouse has cheap (and good) eats and drinks. Also they have a nice pool to take a few laps. Great for a family day.

17655,best iOS game,I recommend GTA SA especially if you have a controller. It just transforms the experience even more and i have like 200 hours on mobile (3 different save files) but the moment i got a controller holy shit I can't go back
26036,best politician,"I'd agree if he just lost, however, it was proven the DNC literally rigged it against him. Just swallowing that and accepting the rigging is not a good move. You are willfully acknowledging and bowing down to the DNC and showing it is ok for the DNC to choose your candidate, primary voters be damned."
57507,best water brand,"Dasani  and Aquafina are Coke and Pepsi.

Anything but those. May as well just drink tap water.

Fiji is my favorite."
38206,best newspapers to read,"I'd still say answering with this methodology is the closest interpretation you are going to get. I think the two generally come hand in hand. No slant will result in being in the center. Unless he wants a paper biased EQUALLY against both, which in the end is more a balancing act that real reporting/news."
32747,best vacation resort,"> Are you the guy that runs Gecko Rock?

Yes.

And look...I do see how what I said came off as being condescending.

But one thing I have learned working in this business is that the vast majority of the travel market is massively uninformed about all the options available when planning a trip.

We've had so many guests tell us that they've only ever stayed at these giant resorts and they had no idea there were other options. I know it's hard to imagine, given that this forum is jam packed with people who find their own way around the world...but most people still book their overseas travel at Costco or similar and I'm sorry, I don't feel in the slightest bit bad about pointing out the reality that there is, in fact, a better way to see the world.

If you're aware of the options and choose to go with the giant corporate shit show because you honestly prefer it, then that's your prerogative and I hope you have a great time...but seriously, most people getting started with international travel have no clue that they don't have to stay in a giant sterile complex with the only off-site excursions being on a bus emblazoned with the name of the resort they're staying at. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with pointing out the obvious flaws in a mega-resort or cruise vacation...people should have thick enough skin to reply, ""But I like that shit,"" and do their thing.

I've had great times in phony places like Disneyland, Universal Studios and Las Vegas...but if someone tells me they do this crap for every single trip then I suggest that perhaps a break in the routine to Paris or Peru might be a nice change of pace."

27802,best breakfast foods,"Usually, for me, a full English is a hangover breakfast, we'll go to a cafe (or pub) an they'll cook the beast. If we are going out on the beer we'll get the breakfast from a pub with a pint and then we're on the beer the whole day. It's a good hangover OR starter breakfast."
15857,best sunglasses for fashion,"Anyone got a rec on a Clubmaster/browline style frame in the 40-80 dollar range?

I have some cheap $12 amazons that I like but they are incredibly flimsy and I have a few pairs of Warby Parker Ames (that are all Rx'd) but I'd like a sturdy pair of non-RX glasses that have the weight/feel of the Ames at a cheaper don't care if I lose them price point."
57343,best water brand,"Every city pretty much has their own aquifer or source for water. So a lot of cities have fantastic water, but a lot of places have really awful water. The city I'm in, the water is *okay.* One city east, the water is fantastic. Two cities north, I have literally seen it come out of the tap still brown."

23166,best social networking site for CS,It would help if you're on developer focused social networks like stackexchange.  Running a blog focused on your projects help too.  I can't imagine someone being penalized for not having a facebook or twitter unless maybe you worked for a trendy social media startup. They probaby would want to know that you're familiar with products in their category.
