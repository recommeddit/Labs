32747,"> Are you the guy that runs Gecko Rock?

Yes.

And look...I do see how what I said came off as being condescending.

But one thing I have learned working in this business is that the vast majority of the travel market is massively uninformed about all the options available when planning a trip.

We've had so many guests tell us that they've only ever stayed at these giant resorts and they had no idea there were other options. I know it's hard to imagine, given that this forum is jam packed with people who find their own way around the world...but most people still book their overseas travel at Costco or similar and I'm sorry, I don't feel in the slightest bit bad about pointing out the reality that there is, in fact, a better way to see the world.

If you're aware of the options and choose to go with the giant corporate shit show because you honestly prefer it, then that's your prerogative and I hope you have a great time...but seriously, most people getting started with international travel have no clue that they don't have to stay in a giant sterile complex with the only off-site excursions being on a bus emblazoned with the name of the resort they're staying at. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with pointing out the obvious flaws in a mega-resort or cruise vacation...people should have thick enough skin to reply, ""But I like that shit,"" and do their thing.

I've had great times in phony places like Disneyland, Universal Studios and Las Vegas...but if someone tells me they do this crap for every single trip then I suggest that perhaps a break in the routine to Paris or Peru might be a nice change of pace.",best vacation resort
