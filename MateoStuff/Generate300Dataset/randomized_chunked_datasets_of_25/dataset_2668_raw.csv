"Can guarantee you that if you drop your raybans on any type of surface, they will pretty much only get scratched. I don't know if you are slam dunking your glasses onto the sidewalk, but i've dropped mine plenty of times and they are fine. Even had a few close calls where i stepped or slightly sat on them and they were fine. I also think the losing your glasses argument is pretty bad. I can lose my phone, that doesn't mean I wouldn't want the one that is more durable..."
I.. I like it when the *red water* comes out
"I keep a folder on my computer to the links that I want to re-read when I finally become a father.  This part of the thread has made me add this link.  

Thanks /u/gmrdd and the top repliers...."
"Here are some overlooked masterpieces:

The Geto Boys

The Horns of Jericho

Penicillin On Wax

Black Mafia Life

Funk Upon A Rhyme"
"went with my parents to a function for some charity group and we shared a table with Ice-T. Super nice guy, down to earth and not high on himself. He has a mouth on him but when he found out my Dad is a retired preacher never heard a bad word again the rest of the night. I ended up talking music and how he goes from Rap to Metal. Man is cool and knows his sh\*t about the metal and Punk scene."
"I bought a pair of Woodies off amazon and they are great. Half the frame (part goes behind the ear) is made of wood and the rest is plastic. I got one made out of ebony wood for $20 and they're the best pair of sunglasses I've ever owned. They also have a really cool pair of sunglasses made out of bamboo, but they really don't fit my style and are $60."
"if you can't see a difference between reality and marketing bs that's your problem, Firefox was abandoned, everything that made it superior was removed, there is no Firefox anymore

Quantum is different product, as limited as chromium, if they had a bit of decency they wouldn't be using the same repo and name but properly indicate that it's a hard fork

it's not new version of Firefox, it's much worse product built on ruins of Firefox' greatness"

Go on r/headphones and ask them
"i have dry hands, always have.  I have recently started dating a new girl and she noticed my dry hands and bought me a really nice lotion for hand repair for no reason, just to be nice.  Things like that matter more than most girls realize."
Intel i7
I'm curious about black orchid and Black opium. Should these be on my list?
"Maybe not Hearthstone. Really not a well designed card game, as someone whoâ€™s played a ton."
"Same here. I liked the concept behind the aliens, but very little else about the book appealed to me. And what's this vampire doing stuck in my SF story? He's got a kludge of an evolutionary backstory, but he's still a vampire. At least he didn't sparkle."
"Let me know what you think of it, I have a huge amount of perfume, through all of it I can find something fun for you to wear."
"put a gun in with your sword, problem solved!"
You can type sufficiently and use it flat but if you push hard on it it will wobble slightly.
"This album is, obviously, not accurate, lol. About 50% of these even deserve to be in the conversation."
"Wow... these are pretty much my favorites, except for Ghost in the Shell, which I guess I will be watching next."
I'll second Oldboy ( the Korean version) an all time great film for me.
Bon Appetit! Especially their Gourmet Makes series.
"This is not a slam on the series, as I've heard really good things, but I can't wait for someone to do a parody of these titles called A \[Place\] of \[Noun\] and \[Adjective\]"
"This is all useless junk. ""Rainbow flame crystals?"" Faceless LED Watch? 1500 Lady Bugs?"
The bald guy was Bruce Willis?!
AYSSOAAW????
