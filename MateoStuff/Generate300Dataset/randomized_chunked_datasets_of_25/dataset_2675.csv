38313,best newspapers to read,"I neither support nor oppose the printing of his cartoons in any publication. Free speech is a nearly sacrosanct issue, as far as I'm concerned. And that means a publication reserves the right to publish them or not for reasons of their own choosing.

In fact, I think they're strictly third-rate political cartoons that nobody would even give the time of day to if not for the horrific events that have elevated them to the global consciousness."
