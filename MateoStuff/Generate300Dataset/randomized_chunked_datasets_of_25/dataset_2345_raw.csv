"Idk where your getting 30-40k from but as a recent graduate from a UC in arguably the highest COL area in the state that is not the cost of a UC education. 

Not hating on community college it is an awesome system that provides great opportunities to many but don't make such a big decision on an accurate data."

After many requests, I did it. [Here's the 158 song playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKTm4sjQQBKz8erwS2_lvVxf5uEa9zpgc). I know there are some others from other users, which is awesome, but I kept adding more stuff. So this is it, I'm not adding anything else. It's been a blast everyone!

I ran out of space, so bonuses beyond 8 (acapella rap, kpop, motivation speeches, and two lists from /u/PretendstoKnowThings) can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3iqbpk/what_is_your_1_workout_song/cuj4rc9)

Just going to compile some of the listed songs with links, because nobody is doing that. A couple people have also been kind enough to make Youtube and Spotify playlists. Some are probably missing a few songs, since I'm updating every twenty minutes or so, but you should be able to get most of it if you dig through the comments!

If only he could write contracts half as well as he could draft.

"I would say Gwent is probably the best on mobile if LoR didn’t do it for you. Cards and Castles is also underrated. Teppen is okay, not very good monetisation but a super unique card game. But anything that isn’t HS; HS is literally the bottom of the barrel in every respective."
Once Upon a Time in the West has a really cool twist at the end.
"fbreader is the best on android. a lot of customisation, change fonts, margins, colour etc"
There are two books with that title. Who wrote the book you are refering to?
"That's not how it was taught in SoCal in the 90s. It was just taught as a fairly regular war of conquest. Usually as a component on Manifest Destiny and all the atrocities America committed in those goals, but it itself wasn't particularly heinous."

Question: what ways could the axios team do to monetize development while also keeping it open source? if it doesn't make money then i would assume it would be hard to keep developers constantly working on it outside of random contributors.

"Hi there!

I don't believe density affects durability, but I'm not positive. It does in one case with the shidenkai as xsoft causes more creases in the bad wearing down the glass beads faster. This is why mid is recommended for shidenkai.

In terms of soft vs xsoft, xsoft does give a touch more control. I had zero and otsu v2 in xsoft and really like both. The only reason I prefer soft to xsoft is that I still get nearly the same control, but my arm doesn't sink into the pad as much. I found I'd get a little too hot on the xsoft versions.

Hope this helped!"

"i live in between Iowa, Nebraska, and south Dakota, in the larger city areas, Verizon  has pretty good speed, at&t has decent speed, but on the edge of the cities or just outside of the larger cities, at&t get ridiculously fast speeds, while Verizon slows to a crawl, they both seem to cover the same areas, i just got t-mobile, they don't cover a lot  of this area outside of the larger cities with their own towers, but you still get coverage with them through roaming towers ( usually at&t or cell one NE Colorado towers from what ive seen) and the speed seems to be okay outside of the city"
"Looks like the iphone 12 will have an oled display, that new iphone 4 boxy design and a really compact 5.4"" screen. Its reported to be cheaper as well, all of this with the addition of a rumored blue color is enough for me since that boxy iphone design is nostalgic to me, i really like compact phones and compact flagships are becoming increasingly hard to find and they are bringing a navy blue color which is my favorite color. The 12 and 11 are gonna be really different phones, depends on your preferences. I would recommend to wait for the iphone 12 and if you dont like it the 11 will be cheaper."
"How do you do, fellow elite national teams?"
