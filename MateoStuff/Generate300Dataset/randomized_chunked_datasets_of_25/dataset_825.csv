31009,best country to live in,"I lived in both but I might be biased, not sure. That's one of the reasons I posted the question, to hear from others.

> I've lived in both the UK and the US and there's no major cultural difference when it comes to how easy it is to break into social groups. 

How about when it comes to deeper and closer relationships, trust, loyalty?

It seems the culture in Europe makes people more trustworthy and enables you to have closer deeper relationships, comparing to US, on average. Would you disagree?

Edit. Here is an article explaining some differences: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/looking-in-the-cultural-mirror/201009/are-american-friendships-superficial"

4890,best home improvement store,"I live very close to an ACE hardware. I LOVE my local ACE, and they’re very helpful, knowledgeable, and have great customer service.

I wish I could get everything I need at Ace, but their stock is limited and sometimes too specific for what I am looking for. 

My local Lowe’s is great for the gardening section. My local Home Depot is great for anything else that Ace doesn’t have."

67083,best places to skydive in california,"+1 - my first tandem was from a Skyvan and it's an experience like nothing else.

But overall, I'd say Oceanside, especially sunset load, would be awesome. Sunset load at Elsinore isn't bad either - Elsinore's my ""second home"" DZ."
26438,best politician,And my Axe!
9526,best toothpaste,"I've heard flossing is bad for your gums, Idk why"
46721,best hand santizer brand,"I agree with you 100 percent on this.    It's important to buy quality (or at least avoid substandard) materials, especially for longer term storage.   I've had the experience of buying cheap products and having the bottles break or crack, which created a mess that sometimes I didn't discover for a month or two.   This has happened to me with hand sanitizers, lotions, off-brand batteries, hair gel, and even a cheap hand-crank radio (it got all sticky on the sides as the plastic finish wore off).     It has also happened with cheap food preps (food buckets that buckled and lost their seal while in storage).   

Another point about hand sanitizer is that it's got LOTS of alcohol and (especially with the cheap stuff) sometimes other unnamed ingredients like methanol etc.   I've made the mistake of liberally applying it to my hands, then absent-mindedly biting a fingernail, licking my finger to turn a page, etc.   That shit will make you dizzy if it gets in your mouth!   Kind of like grain alcohol.   

My final observation is to periodically check your preps to make sure everything works, hasn't degraded, needs to be upgraded etc.    We live in an area with a lot of hurricanes, and I learned this lesson years ago with a gas generator that I failed to maintain.   Took me a long time sitting in my unairconditioned house after a hurricane to blow out the lines, clean up the gummy gas, etc. before I could use it (cursing the whole time :)).  Better to deal with these things while you still have power, can go to the store, etc."
52347,best hiphop album,*Endtroducing.....* is an experimental hip-hop/instrumental hip-hop album. It still qualifies as an album irrespective of whatever meaningless criteria you're using to define what is or isn't album material.
