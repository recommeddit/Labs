66153,best soccer team in the world,"I have also not watched anything before mid 90s. This Barca team was amazing, no doubt about it. It is so interesting to see how it develops though, and how many times I've been thinking that this must be the best team i have ever seen (United 1999 and 2008, Milan 2005, Barcelona with Pep and Ronaldinho, Bayern 2013, Arsenal invincible, Galasticos). I wonder who the next team that blows my mind will be."

40474,best midrange GPU,"The mid tier GPU usually have best performance per dollar standalone. But if you factor in the entire cost of the system, the value changes.

RTX 3060 Ti is currently best performance/dollar for a new GPU.

But for buyers you should only buy what you need (and maybe a little more) as extra GPU horsepower is going to waste if you dont use it. And if you buy too low, it can compromise your gaming experience so you might as well fork over a little more to hit your performance expectation, even if what you end up buying wasnt the best GPU in performance/dollar."

4751,best home improvement store,"Both are great when you just need to run pick up a few things for what ever the issue of the day is. You'll find most home improvement projects cost less than $50 and an hour or two...and the box stores are fine for that. If you have a serious project where you're going to drop some $$, do your research. 


And what ever you do, don't ask the associates for help with how to do your project. They might be able to help you with a part or tool, but they won't be able to tell you that you have to dig a ditch at least 18 inches in order to bury a outdoor power line."

39414,best web browser,"The production version of Edge is my favorite, I'm sticking with that for the time being, all the other browsers including ChrEdge suck in comparison for various reasons including speed, power consumption, and usability."
66132,best college in california,"College reddits should be for students, administrators and instructors, prospective students, alumni, and community members interested in the college. Since community college students are only there for a short while, it's harder for them to create and develop a reddit community. 

Go ahead and create a reddit for CCSF and see what happens."
60217,best freezer brand,"Yeah I just defrost mine when I'm low on meat and before I get half a pig or go on a fishing trip.  That happems to be once or twice a year.  I also just don't like the frost.  I think the more you open it and the more humid it is, the more frost builds up."
37829,best Marvel movie,"Great movie, not ""hands down best Marvel movie"". I mean, Marvel as a whole has Logan, SM2, ITSV, CA:TWS, Civil War, Infinity War/EG, X-Men First Class, Days of future Past, Iron Man, etc lol. But good points you made!"
72325,best keyboard switches,"If you can get a board with hot swappable switches, you can almost use it like a switch tester.

44992,best items under $100,"The SP is, although a great intro to the concept , a bit gimmicky. I showed my ex husband them and he was like “wtfffff that cost damn near $100 (am in NZ), hold my beer” and went to the garage and put together 3 pieces of nice wood… voila, a squatty potty."
