"Kindles are sweet, but there are some people (myself included to some degree) who just love the feeling of turning the page, holding something paper in your hand, etc.

Edit: I've only used a Kindle once, and could definitely see myself using it for vacations as the OP was talking about."
"I'm not sure if I've even heard 500 albums more than once, let alone heard 500 albums I think are great. Neither do they, I reckon. This list is basically ""500 Albums we, NME as a whole, enjoy."" 

I can't even make a ""What!?! *insert band* at *insert number*?"" statement, because it goes without saying."

"Please do so, I personally rated infernal affairs better than the departed."
"Just based on the posts on this sub, probably people getting told off for using it as a regular desktop and then going to the Kali site to try and fix a problem they wouldn't be having if they used the distro appropriately."
"I always check Ace Hardware first, I have been an Ace fan for many years and always go there, they always treat me right and have time to answer my questions."

"Yeah good point. ""good students"" are ""good students"" whether they're at UCLA or Fullerton and end of the day, those internships matter quite a bit if they're successful. As a grad student though with already 50k in debt i get the value of USC (I'm a big believer in the power of networking). The amazing thing is how comparable the prices are for graduate studies at the UC schools vs the big private ones, it's a little depressing. Like UCSD is ~60k for the year program and USC is close to that."
people who downvote chicken fingers make me *sick*
The best answer here imo

"If the reason why you want a pet is for your daughter to cuddle I wouldn't get any at all, she is too young. And if a fish is too boring it's obvious that you don't want to teach her the responsibility part of pet ownership, because it does require work. 

I wouldn't get her any pet at this age"
"This has been asked in other subreddits as well but unfortunately I only tried `mc` very briefly just to see what it's like. I know it has a dual panel design and you can enter shell commands directly by typing I think. For `lf` dual panel can be achieved by using `tmux` for multiplexing. I have something about this in the example config file in the repo. In `lf` in order to run shell commands you need to type a key first (e.g. `!`, `$` and `&`). Other than that, there is some support for autocompletion for shell commands which I don't remember if `mc` has or not.

`lf` is more comparable to `ranger` though and I have a comparison for it in here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/55nzvd/lf_a_terminal_file_manager/

Maybe if there is a comparison between `mc` and `ranger` somewhere, that could help."
"Not the biggest Pac Fan but I'd say All eyes on Me or Nas Illmatic as the best hip hop album (unbias)

My personal favorites is Big Pun Capital Punishment or Jay Z reasonable doubt

A wild card Brotha Lynch Season of the Sickness or 3 6 mafia Chapter 2: World domination

Another random is Jaren Benton - My grandma's basement

I know you said all time but just thought I'd throw some out there"
I like how the only reggae presence is two relatively unimportant Bob Marley albums.

MacUpdate.com is a good app tracker
"Never heard of it, but looks interesting. Why I didn't find it when I was looking for a good file manager? I went with ranger."
