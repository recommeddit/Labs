24549,best anime,"1. Made in Abyss  - A great exploration of an interesting fantasy world. The Abyss is a giant pit in the earth, and people brave its depths to uncover rare artifacts. As they delve deeper, explorers encounter monsters and trials of ever increasing dangers, and the series starts leaning towards darker and darker themes as it goes on. This series really just hits all the elements of my personal favorite types of shows.

2. 3-Gatsu no Lion - A drama/slice-of-life series that follows a highschool-age professional shogi player, his life's struggles, and his interaction with a small friendly family of three girls and their grandpa that runs a sweets shop. It is a series that depicts depression, and in the second season bullying, in a very realistic and moving manner. There are also many great lighthearted moments in the series as well. Overall, an amazing series that actually shares my number 1 spot, and it and Made in Abyss are both amazing yet very different types of shows.

3. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou - A great slice of life, but with a twist. It follows two girls in military uniform, who drive around a post-apocalyptic wasteland of a world. However, even with this dark backdrop, the series is still incredibly calm and lighthearted. Slice of life is one of my favorite genres, and this one pulled it off excellently, with a unique and interesting backdrop.

4. Steins;Gate - A great science fiction series with fun and quirky characters, and a neat and well thought out time travel plot. The start of it was pretty slow, but once the plot picked up around 8-ish episodes in, it had my full attention and never let go.

5. My Hero Academia - A fun and interesting world full of people with superpowers, or ""quirks"", where being a hero is actually a regulated job that many people strive for. It basically follows a group of  students through super-hero high school, and the majority of the characters are very interesting and likable. I often don't enjoy the typical ""shounen"" series, but this show avoided a lot of the tropes and has rather well written stories and characters. It lands in my top five because it is by far my personal favorite of a genre that I don't usually enjoy as much.

29078,best calendar tool,"I been trying to find a calendar that will work across Linux and Android so i can get an alert on each to take the garbage out to the road the night before garbage day at least a few different times spaced out an hour or so apart in case i dismiss it the first couple of times because i am busy. Our garbage man picks up the garbage very early in the morning when it is still dark and i am still sleeping.

When my grandpa was alive he would remind me a few times before i went out  to take the garbage to the road sometime late at night. Now of days i literally forget every other week and miss the garbage man.

My grandpa would say take the garbage out, Then i would say I am doing something right now in a little bit. After a few more times then i got the garbage to the road and the rest of the inside garbage too. After the 3rd or 4th time he reminded me."

25501,best cricket teams of all time,"Unfortunately tactically weak and not very good at winning. Strong resources but lower win loss ratio than all of the long term rsa captains of the last couple of decades.

He took a team that had lost 2 series and drawn 1 with all the rest being wins in 5 years and kept them around 6th place in the test rankings for a number of years."
43344,best ad service for mobile applications,Ideally you should have >5 ad networks to maximize the bid.
69958,best major to study in college,History is good for everything and great for nothing. It's a versatile all around degree that shows you can interpret information and think critically. Some people will say you'll have trouble getting a job but I haven't found that to be the case. I live in a fairly poor Southern state and have had no issues getting/staying employed with my BA in history.

16567,best pet for toddlers,"Do you have a small (or large) garden? Guinea pigs are fairly low-maintenance, can be petted and if you have two will keep each other company. If you have a secure yard, you don't even have to stress too much if one gets out of their enclosure. 
On the other hand, at two, I would suggest you involve your son with cat care first. Not litter handling, but he is old enough to fill up the cat food bowl and the water bowl (my son does this). Also gentle hands when petting and so on."
