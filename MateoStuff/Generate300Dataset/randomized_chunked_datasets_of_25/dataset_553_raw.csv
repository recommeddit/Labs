"Jennifer Lopez.  

I met that cunt at Ramstein AB, Germany during a USO tour.  Every fiber in her being is to be a cunt to everyone around her.  I interacted with her a few times over two days for a ""Salute the Patriots"" music contest/tour, and literally couldn't stand to be in the same building with her by the end of it.

She also made a friend of mine stay in tears most of the time J-Lo was there.  This friend (in base services) worked really, *really* hard to ensure the USO visit was a success (and it was), and she had to spend so much time meeting that cunt's ridiculous needs on her rider.

I was so put off by my experience with her, that I've asked my wife to never play one of her movies or her music in the house.  EVER.

TL;DR - J-Lo rustled my jimmies."

I tend to prefer old school trance as I love that 'rolling' feeling. Only problem is it can be a little hypnotic and I get really thrown off if someone tries to talk to me.

"I’m going to guess early thirties woman. You are bold; you used to say you didn’t care what people thought but still kind of did, but these days you really don’t care and are just living life for yourself. I’m going to guess that you work mostly from home even when not COVID, but in a fairly traditional field. Oh, and you love bold scents, wood, and you don’t mind some funk."

"I changed majors from Poli Sci to Finance while in college and I'm definitely glad I did. My current job is slightly different than what I studied but still in the same field (degree had a focus on credit analysis and lending but I work in investing). 

If I could give you one piece of advice it'd be don't be afraid to explore what interests you while you're in college. If I hadn't explored my options I definitely wouldn't be where I'm at today, working a job I enjoy at a great company."
