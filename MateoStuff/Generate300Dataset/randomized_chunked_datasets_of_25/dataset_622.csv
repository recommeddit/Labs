3332,"When it comes to webcams/cameras, people tend to forget that you'll more than likely NEVER fullscreen the camera. So yeah, once you've scaled down the camera in your stream, the total resolution it can output is not as important. Getting something that'll output like, 5XXp and maybe 60fps (like a PSEye camera) is pretty good for a stream. What IS super important is good, balanced, and intense lighting. If you give a camera enough lighting, the picture will be great. If you give one of those cheap logitech webcams very little light, it will look like shit.

However when it comes to stuff like audio and general PC build for single PC streaming setups, I do think a lot more consideration and investment planning should be done. If you go the USB mic route, you are really limiting yourself to that mic. Your only upgrade path is another USB mic. Where as if you took the time to save up a little more, you could get a really decent USB audio interface which would allow you to open up your horizon to hundreds of XLR mics. 

Single PC streaming setups have become much better in potential output quality due to the better NVENC encoding options on the newer Nvidia cards. Dual PC setups will still net a better looking stream (and truthfully makes your stream less of a pain with everything stream related getting offloaded to another PC) but you can now achieve pretty great results with single PC setups.",best webcamera
