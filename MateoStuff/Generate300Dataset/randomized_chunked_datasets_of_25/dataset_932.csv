23654,best car racing video game,"Honestly dude, I do NOT get the Underground 2 love, coming from a person who has actually nolifed the hell out of it back in the day. Underground 1 runs circles around it by comparison, an open world means nothing if the tradeoff is making everything else shallow.   


Or maybe it's just the extra customization. Sure, can't knock that, even if I'd rather just play Heat at that point."
46102,best trick or treating candy,Found the party pooper
18833,best YouTube video,[I used to watch this a lot when I was younger.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwz2Y_RLamA)
31234,best country to live in,"I don't live there, I've only visited a few times, actually just left the country a few days ago. I realize this summer has been an anomaly, but I think Northern France should be safer from the heat in general. I see your nickname is Montpellier and yeah that's almost Spain, it can be hot there, but I went to Lille not long ago and a local told be this summer has really been exceptional, said their summer weather is usually in the 20s (C). And Lille isn't even the veeery north of France. So I'm pretty sure it should be doable for you to find a place with weather that's good enough at least like 11 months of the year."

47296,best state to visit in the United States,so much better than new york
33681,best electric car,"Yeah they are great value even as is, but I don't want to drop 60ish k after tax credits to get one with FSD right now haha."
29822,best money managing app,I use goodbudget. It's free! And it let's you manually input transactions and divide up your budget I to categories though you'll probably have to do some extra math to figure out how big those categories should be. It may not be the most comprehensive one but it's been very effective for me
29933,best money managing app,"Cool, thanks again!"
38033,best Marvel movie,Ryan coogler us great director.
34849,best NFL player,"Maybe I’m being naive but I don’t think so. He definitely gets suspended at the least. 

There’s also the whole thing of the fact that even if this never happened, he probably would not be playing for the Texans this year anyways. They won’t be able to trade him, he doesn’t want to play for them, and they have a very good reason to not play him now."
19659,best YouTube video,What did you expect? Con\-dams?
71322,best movies with a cool twist,"The Sting is probably the best one imo.

The twist in The Game was just way too far fetched imo."
55255,best places to hike in the east coast,"I’m based in Charlotte.  I like views so you can find them in all these recommendations.   Put the title into YouTube and you’ll get a flavor for the area. 

Linville Gorge

Carvers Gap to 19E (hiking along the Appalachian trail)

Grayson Highlands 

Great Smokey Mtn National Park / Mt Sterling loop

There are options for longer hikes along the AT and you can get a shuttle if you want more miles."
