Pretty sure you meant Dragon QUEST XI.

I also suggest Pyre.  Itâ€™s an amazing Occult Sports Ball RPG hybrid that I canâ€™t recommend enough"
Tom Holland. He's playing the literal teenage Spider-Man...not a 30 year old playing a high schooler.
That's also /r/alcohol. I subbed thinking it was a place for adults to discuss booze but almost every thread is a newly 21 year old asking for the best way to get drunk because he doesn't like the taste of any alcohol he's tried .

"If you take into account all the European trophies which include:
 
* UCL Champions League
* UEL	Europa League
* CWC      Cup Winners' Cup (defunct)
* UIC	Intertoto Cup (defunct)
* USC	Super Cup
* IC	        Intercontinental Cup (defunct)

Then the clubs with the most trophies are:

1. Real Madrid with 22

2. AC Milan with 17

3. Barcelona with 14

4. Liverpool with 11


5. Juventus with 11


6. Bayern Munich with 10

7. Ajax with 10

8. Internazionale with 8

9. Manchester United with 7


10. Porto with 7 


11. AtlÃ©tico Madrid with 7


12. Sevilla with 6 


13. Chelsea with 5


14. Anderlecht with 5 


15. Valencia with 5 


16. Feyenoord with 4

17. Hamburger SV with 4

18. Parma with 4

19. Nottingham Forrest with 3 

20. Borussia Dortmund with 3 



That's 5 Spanish teams, 4 Italian teams, 4 English Teams, 3 German Teams, 2 Dutch teams, 1 Portuguese team and 1 Belgian team in the official top 20. 



I'm really surprised that Benfica is so high in the /r/soccer list considering, they didn't even make the top 20, with 2 European trophies.

"I think NFS2 gets into my category of 'Games that I want to experience for the first time again'. I marvel at driving down the city, finding new shops to upgrade my old but reliable Miata...

There's just this feeling you get as a kid, you know?"

"A few reasons.

1) As already mentioned, I like having different grammar algorithms

2) The different font / design layout freshens the work to my eyes - like how people suggest you print it out or read it aloud or just change font. Sometimes just changing something like that will help you experience your writing in a fresh way and catch mistakes you missed before.

3) I find Docs' commenting easier than Word's, and when the whole point is to comment on what needs work, that's a big plus

Switching back and forth isn't hard at all. I open my Word document with the whole story in it (I save individual scenes first, then compile them into chapters, and then put them into a single document for the whole story), hit Cntl+A to highlight all, then just copy paste into a new Doc. The only hard thing about it is compiling the chapters into a single document and then later breaking them back down into chapter documents, but that's just 10 minutes of copy paste work. Not hard at all."

"Early on, Napoleon was untouchable.  I can't remember which war it was, but he knew that he and another country would be going to war.  So this crazy mother fucker locks himself in a room for 3 days or so with maps of the entire regions.  He comes out, and informs his subordinates that the battle will end at a very specific location in a certain time range.

And he was absolutely correct.  Scary."
