That doesn't even make any sense, jerk."

Bob Appetit is such a good channel!! All their videos from the test kitchen are so entertaining
"How do you know this much haha, since from your post history looks like you're from Nevada? Like the USC = Harvard-Westlake part is spot on and how the fuck do you know what Arcadia is"

"You can make a spreadsheet for ppl to review/edit/add, it is more convenient for  than listing the tweaks without alphabetical order or function categories like back in the day."
"Wow I used the mm300 for years before I started really experimenting about a year ago!

So zero is your safe pick, but IMO if you want a little more speed and want something more unique, try otsu v2 or hien. A little more comfort and control go for otsu v2, and for a little more speed do hien."
Is there something inherently wrong with supporting scientific journals? I'm asking because on the surface it seems like they are providing a good service but sometimes there is more below the surface.
"My mother recently took up golf so I bought her a pair of Nike golf shoes. They weren't cheap but damn, do they look fly."
"Oh 110% I am in the vast minority haha like I said, it was an incredibly well made game, and I really wanted to, and should have, liked it. Just didn't get it's hooks into me"

"1. Dark - on Netflix. Great mystery/thriller show. Requires 110% of your attention. There is a lot going on and it's key that you follow who each character is. One of the best shows I've seen in the last few years

2. Assassination of Gianni Versace: America Crime  Story - the main character/villian is acted so well and has such a creepy vibe to him that's hard to explain. There's a reason why he won an Emmy for the role

3. Manhunt: Unabomber - on Netflix too. About the FBI agent hunting down the Unabomber. I thought it was a good 8 episode miniseries"
I waited on him in NYC once. I charged his phone for him. He didn‚Äôt know about the airplane mode trick for iPhones. I did it for him and he was very grateful. His friends picked up the check (around $240). They left $20. He came back and gave me $60.
