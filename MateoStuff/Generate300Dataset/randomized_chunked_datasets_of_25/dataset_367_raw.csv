"Kanye West - POWER

Kanye West ft. Jay Z & Swizz Beatz - POWER Remix"
Maybe because the story of the movie is good enough that they don’t have to act that well
"Watching the last episode right now, haha"
I'm pretty sure a lot of their house brand stuff comes off the exact same assembly lines as Harbor Freight.
There are some cool spots in Hollywood. Hollywood Blvd sucks though.
"Some recent ones that come to mind:

- **A good shower head**: Makes a world of difference. 
- **Motion sensing night lights**: Don't step on things at night, don't wake up my partner by turning on the lights
- Honeywell **humidifiers**: Sleep much better
- **Remote case for Apple TV remote**: Protects the device, red colour to make it easy to find, magnetic so I can attack it to side of coffee table
- **Kitchen torch**: Creme brulee away!
- **Waterproof bluetooth speaker**: Attach it to the wall, listen to podcasts and music in the shower.
- **Quality umbrella**: Got tired of buying $15 ones that barely last a season. 
- **Inexpensive souvenirs** from travels: Photos are nice but we love having small things around the house that remind us of the memories we had is priceless."
"Cheers to ISL!

I havent look at that Deep Learning with R, but I have been slowly working through this from MIT press:[deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)"
Best slice
"Bloodborne 

Nioh

Valkyria Chronicles 

Disgaea 5

Persona 5"
There it is. Shotgun one and I’m good for the night. Completely trashed.
Apple cider & Fireball.
"Afterwards England also forbid settlement West of the Appalachian mountains to reserve it for native people, which upset colonists (even though they ignored it mostly)"
"What I can't understand is where that limitation comes from. Why can't Bluetooth introduce a profile that combines A2DP with the way, way outdated HFP?

It's using the same 2.4 GHz as the dongle Cloud Flight uses, yet it can't handle good quality voice calls. It's baffling to me."
"Does battery life or weight matter to you? If they don't matter to you, the Zephyrus G14 is not your best option."
"If you want good BBQ I recommend Kansas City, Missouri or St Louis, Missouri."
"I usually go with your second approach listed. I've actually got a ""rainy day"" cologne that I think works really well with the subdued atmosphere of gray clouds and wet air. Usually cold summer days don't get an absolute winter fragrance, tho, because it's not truly cold outside."
"Learn GIS and basic computer science.

Thank me later.

I knew a ton of Environmental majors in College. You will want to learn that technology , specifically ArcMap"
Can’t you get it through Unc0ver Dark?
None of that shit will work fast enough to take care of your issues. All it does anyway is slightly lesson the symptoms.
The experience of going into their stores sucks. Feels like they're stuck in the 80s. But touché on their other revenue streams.
"If you like the look and the sound, a guitar tech can make it play good. A general setup for a guitar isn’t that expensive and makes a world of difference."
"Detention - This game is so thought provoking and deep by the time you realise what is fully going on i don’t think I’ve felt so reflective over a game ever, it is also educational into past and present day. Not for the soft at heart and it is an adult game based on the content and story.

KOF 2012- This is such an underrated game but one of the best fighters, and whilst the graphics aren’t great the game runs really smooth on mobile.

Journey - Do I need to say anymore, timeless piece of art game and perfect port.

Hyper light drifter - Again a great artistic game with lots of character and soul

Alien Blackout - Very good game for mobile and intense gameplay, fun but daunting, great graphics and atmosphere

Taiko pop tap - so fun, great gameplay, graphics and new upgrades for songs to keep on coming back, very Japanese

Mo Astray - Another deep and thought provoking game, strange and interesting, excellent gameplay, tricky puzzles, great artwork

Under Depths of fear - Intense and atmospheric game, very good graphics and sound work, truly quite scary

Secret of Mana - The original and one of the best rpgs ever 

Absolute Drift - simple but fun and addictive car drifting game, great art style"
"don't get me wrong, madvillainy is great but i would not put that in my GOAT list

edit: i mean madvillainy's even in my name, but that's because it introduced me to DOOM"
model d soon maybe the skoll and hati will be to small.
"Really depends. After you get through the religious wars of SQL v. NoSQL, then you have a whole shitload of other factors to consider. 

Mongo is a good starting point for NoSQL.

Postgres and MySQL are good for SQL. 

But keep in mind that different DBs solve different problems. 

Good luck!"
