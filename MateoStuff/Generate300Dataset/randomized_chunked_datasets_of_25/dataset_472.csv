You’ll be missed"
13436,best spreadsheet editor,"Thanks.  This was the result of tools developed over several years for various projects at Yale.  I took those tools and generalized them for simple websites.  I've got far more tools that use the same API. For example, one queries PubMed, download the XML results, parses and uploads the XML data into another Google spreadsheet and then uses that information to create a local publication list."
71156,best movies with a cool twist,"Fractured -- not as much ""mind blown"" but ""of course!...""

5205,best home improvement store,Revenue has much less to do with you the mere homeowner vs the contractor. Home Depot’s pro dept is fast and easy. Those are the guys dropping 2500 a week not a year.
54607,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hey I’m a very competitive FPS player who plays Valorant overwatch and apex legends. I play fingertip grip with the viper mini and have a mm350 atm. Out of the ostu v2, hien, and zero what would you suggest?"

4938,best home improvement store,"I'm not a fan of Lowe's, but it's less than a mile from home. 2 traffic lights and I have what I need.  The lumber is almost always warped and knotty (I think it sits outside, I've got wood off the shelf and it's been wet or frozen depending on time if year). If I need something nice or quality, I'll make the half hour drive to home Depot. It's one of the big ones, everything is always in stock and the lumber is decent, I think they store theirs indoors before it hits the shelves."
58369,best cologne,I love Polo Blue personally!
28991,best breakfast foods,"Salad with 
raw salmon (or cooked of course depending on the quality and if you can serve it raw), 
rucola (=rocket salad?), 
tomatoes, 
parma or prosciutto ham, 
cantaloupe melon, 
the kind of salad with a little bit of red color on the leaves.
and cheese if you like.
Use a lot of olive oil as it gives the food a fruity taste and contains lots of energy for the day. 

Tip: cut your salmon in max. 2x4cm thick bites and put them on the pan with oil and sprinkle some salt on top. Start with the ""bottom"" part down (aka. what has been on the skin of the fish and has a gray color) and turn it around when the colour turns more into pink than red. This part may look more grilled, but be careful when you've turned it around. Don't let the fish get too cooked and always take a big bite of one piece to try the consistency! You should now have delicious pieces of fish that you can throw into the salad."
27612,best bollywood actor,Same. But there are times when I hate him too. Its a love hate thing I have for Ranbir. But yeah he's pretty attractive. Dude's gonna be 40 for God's sake and in the recent pics he looks in his late 20s ffs

21063,best workout music,They were formed by the original Ensiferum singer.  It's not really Folky like Ensiferum is but I think they are the best melodic death metal band out there.  Check out Starchild from their debut album and Sons of Winter and Stars from Time I.  Amazing stuff.  If those songs don't do it for you...
20694,best workout music,That transition is legendary.
55662,best action and adventure novel series,I'd say there was more suspense than combat. Corey does very well at keeping the reader engaged at all times.
67837,best science fiction novel,"Excel, and just googled a March Madness bracket."
14998,best romantic novel,"And if you like Regency romances, Georgette Heyer is brilliant! I discovered a copy of Friday's Child in my boarding school library many, many years ago, and it was one of those 'life before this book and life after this book' moments for me. I'd start with Frederica or Regency Buck."
