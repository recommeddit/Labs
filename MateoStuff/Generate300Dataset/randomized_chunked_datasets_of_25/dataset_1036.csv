66140,best soccer team in the world,"I think so. Obviously they aren't as invincible as they were last year, losing 5-1 in the league. But with Flick and their elite squad I think they'll dominante the UCL again."
51391,best iphone case,"I've only used speck cases since the iphone 4, but I'm getting a mini this year and they're not making the type of case I liked for it. So, maybe otterbox. Got a lot of reviews to watch."

6987,best iPhone,"There's also some inconsistencies in quality, my X panel is slightly dimmer along the right edge. I think the removal of 3D touch also gave the bottom flex cables and batteries more space."
21551,best winnie the pooh comic,Poopshit.
8944,best toothpaste,"yes it is necessary.  these two fluoride sources work by different mechanisms.  water fluoridation is most effective by incorporating fluoride into teeth while they are developing, before they erupt into your mouth.  fluoride in toothpaste then concentrates fluoride on the surface of the tooth, where cavities start."
39717,best podcast for biologists,"It is such an interesting process - I may try someday, but I probably can't do it justice yet. It's such a massive event in terms of physical DNA change. The shattering is such a strange phenomenon to observe (or least see illustrated). Rampant DNA keeps the argument for cancer therapeutics that target these processes going!"

46530,best trick or treating candy,Jolly Ranchers in IL? I don't believe there's that many people that enjoy sucking on a rectangle for 3 hours. If you attempt to speed up the process: your molars explode.

19011,best YouTube video,the best thing he does is when he's stirring something he replays the thing 10 times and edits the pitch of him hitting the glass so it makes a short tune lol.
32307,best hotel to live in,"The scale.

Management wants things to be automatic for you. A person there when you need them and every item you could need, before you need it. But the *scale* of that is purposefully hidden.

For example, You see your housekeeper. 

You might see that there are 5 other Housekeepers on that floor, a Houseman per floor and a Special Request Delivery person, if you look closely.

You don't see the 4-6 desk workers manning the radios so that we know when to enter certain rooms, who wants special pillows, how we manage the 3 rooms that all want service at 1PM or replacing rooms that asked for no service.

You don't see the 6 supervisors spot checking check out rooms for cleanliness. Nor do you see the laundry teams, plural. (Sheets and Guest Laundry are separate, and Guest is split into Dry Cleaning and Non Dry Clean) You might see the public Parlor attendants, but you probably won't see the team cleaning the pool or deep cleaning the gym sauna.

At 7:30AM every morning, the service area just *explodes* with activity, like you kicked two ant nests at once. 60 housekeepers on a single shift? Guess it's a slow day.

***And that's just housekeeping.*** 

We have three industrial scale kitchens for various purposes! Four if you count pastries! Security teams! Contact companies for large events! Teams of engineers in every specialty. *I don't even know where the IT office is, but we do have one!* I'm one of the more knowledgeable on where to find items for special requests and I still find new storage rooms every other week. We found a 1930's printing press nobody knew we had!

Its fucking *wild* how many moving parts there are. Flipping 500 rooms in a day while setting up for 2 $1,000,000 wedding simultaneously. Fulfilling 100 Room Service Orders while catering those weddings while running our restaraunt. Fixing a leaky shower head in the pool while ensuring a Guest had an extra couch in their room for the kid that just loves couch beds. All of this together is called ""An average Tuesday in Summer."""

Club of Crows"
61938,Best RPG game on PS4,Dragon Quest 11 for sure. It’s a throwback to the old school turn based RPGs so it’s a lot of fun and very wholesome with a lot of charm.
68403,best science fiction novel,"Well, that's certainly food for thought..."
27963,best breakfast foods,I usually eat plain oatmeal no sugar or cinnamon just oatmeal
25008,best spiderman actor,"Yes, I mean the whole point of Spiderman is he's a guy with powers that is trying to balance leading a semi-normal life while being a superhero too. Toby is the most human out of these, while the others while they are good actors seems like they are missing something."
