41440,"I really think guitar and piano both have it's ups and downs.
Guitar is easier To transpose, but piano have more and easier acessible voicings.
Piano have a wider range and guitar is more portable.
Guitar have more ""sibilings"" (bass, electric/acoustic, uke, mandolin, banjo, etc.) that you can re-use and exchange technique. Piano have keyboards/synths that open a wide variety of possibilities soundwise.
I think both are viable as far as theory goes but you have to analize your needs/possibilities.

I'm a guitar player myself, but I really admire  piano as the great instrument it is and I'm trying to get around finding my way in these keyboards",best instrument to play

After his act we thought he left, so we started eating all the trays of food in his waiting room. He poked his head in and joked that we were hotboxing the room. Then he came and sat with us for an hour! He sat next to me, and when I told him it was my friends birthday and this friend was a big fan, he took my phone and called this friend and talked to him. It was amazing. This was 2005, I think right before he took a big break from everything.",best celebrity
