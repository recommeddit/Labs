37592,best Marvel movie,"Yeah, Infinity War not being higher is the one that surprises me the most."
41440,best instrument to play,"I really think guitar and piano both have it's ups and downs.
Guitar is easier To transpose, but piano have more and easier acessible voicings.
Piano have a wider range and guitar is more portable.
Guitar have more ""sibilings"" (bass, electric/acoustic, uke, mandolin, banjo, etc.) that you can re-use and exchange technique. Piano have keyboards/synths that open a wide variety of possibilities soundwise.
I think both are viable as far as theory goes but you have to analize your needs/possibilities.

I'm a guitar player myself, but I really admire  piano as the great instrument it is and I'm trying to get around finding my way in these keyboards"

4558,best text editor,">Good for basic editing, but it is limited in what all it can do.

Nano should not be underestimated. The editor offers much more than just the functions displayed in the lower bar.

58490,best cologne,My boyfriend really likes Armani Code.
16708,best pet for toddlers,"Don’t go for the small animals (seem easy to care for but cage cleaning+having to be carful with handling = board children and more work along with shorter life spans). cats are good especially if you get a lazy, nice, shelter cat who likes kids (I had one and he was the best pet ever). If you do go the dog route bulldogs are amazing, I had 2 when I was younger and they were probably the most patient, loving dogs ever. They are also really easy to care for since they don’t shed as much as some other breeds I’ve had."

59981,best perfume,"Burberry Brit is one of those that I used to always have on hand. I haven't bought a bottle in a year or two, but I might have to go pick one up in the next cpl days. It is a very nice scent. I'm a pretty big fan of Grey Flannel too. I picked it up one day just for the hell of it. I figured for $10, if I didn't like it, I could give it away or find some use for it. But I was pretty happy with it"

21956,best celebrity,"Mine is dave chappelle too. I was in a college group that brought in speakers and performers so we brought him in. After his act we thought he left, so we started eating all the trays of food in his waiting room. He poked his head in and joked that we were hotboxing the room. Then he came and sat with us for an hour! He sat next to me, and when I told him it was my friends birthday and this friend was a big fan, he took my phone and called this friend and talked to him. It was amazing. This was 2005, I think right before he took a big break from everything."
4456,best text editor,"Used to be a Sublime Text 3 nut, just because I like something simple. 

And then I discovered VS Code. Does the same thing, its light weight, but lets me jump around when I look at a function/class definition or whatever. Has extensions to let me do my job faster, and looks cool."
