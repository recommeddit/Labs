If you get a firm grip on my bags then I'll probably lean in for a kiss.
"You can play DS games on the 3DS, so generations 4-7 are available to you. Skip Diamond/Pearl and Sun/Moon as Platinum & Ultra Sun/Moon improve on them in every way. Here's my ranking:

1. HeartGold/SoulSilver
2. Platinum
3. Black 2/White 2
4. Black/White
5. Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire (3DS)
6. XY (3DS)
7. Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon (3DS)"
"From WWI: read up on the Battle of Verdun. A valuable lesson for anyone who buys into the whole ""the French are pussies"" line.

From WWII: Battle of Kursk. If you like tank warfare, this battle is a must to study."
"My favorite scientific poster:
[Neural correlates of interspecies perspective taking in the post-mortem Atlantic Salmon](http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.jpg)"
"Aamir is fake and hypocrite, far from intelligent. And about his personal life didn't he disown his kid? left his wife and two kids to be with an AD? AFAIK he did not share a good relation with his Dad and other relatives. His brother went to cops against him"
"YSL, Dior sport."
"On this criteria it’s about as impressive as a Model 3 SR+, with a slightly longer range and a slightly slower charge speed. Both the standard range Teslas and the ID.4 are only about 30-45m slower than the long range Teslas over 10 hours of driving, to 1000km. Given the price point and the form factor it seems impressive to me."
"I've gotten to try on the hyperfeel, and it's pretty cushy. The insole of the shoe is all lunarlon, but the actual shoe has none, which is a little abnormal. The insole also resembles the sole of a free, because it has cuts and hatches on the bottom, making it pretty flexible. I'm not sure I'd compare them to vibrams, but if you like your free's then you'll probably like these as well."
"It specifically says that the attached charger is not a genuine HP charger, and refuses to charge."
"If you are a skilled tech person, or in one of the other in demand industries like pharmacy, then it isn’t as bad."
"What's the slowest of the bunch?  I'm a CS player, and have used the Zowie GSR and Gigantus V2, but have been looking at artisan pads because of the durability/longevity.  Do any of them even have the stopping power for tac shooters or should I look elsewhere?

EDIT: currently using a Viper Ultimate @ 800 dpi, 1.05 in game sens."
"I’ve had Cingular/AT&T for over 20 years, first for about 3 years in Atlanta and now for 20 in Chicago. It’s been good other than a year or two as iPhones first started getting popular and the data network couldn’t keep up. But they’ve been fine for at least the past 5-6 years again."
"to be fair, most of the badassery is on the islamic side."
Some investors like disruptive speculative stocks that’s not in the S&P. Some investors are looking for that x10 growth
"I haven't had problems with that so I guess I can't really comment on it, in my experience pot can decrease perception of pain which can definitely make you lift harder than usual and yes, possibly hurt yourself too."
Netflix.
"Like a lil anarchy in your sci fi, eh?"
Do you have any recommendation for a good matte protector?
Yeay congrats! <3
"I've heard he's a nice guy, he's so good at playing Malfoy that you'd almost expect him to be a dickhead in real life."
"Something like a gtx 1660 super, but they are so much more expensive than they should be. I recommend using a stock checker and follow that for a few days/weeks and see if you can get a decent deal"
You essentially challenged a silverback gorilla in it's natural habitat and got away with it.
Did Brady hold the Rams offense to like 3 points? And intercept that ball on the goal line? Don’t think that I’m hating or don’t acknowledge Brady being incredible but championships are team efforts and it helps winning so many with one of the greatest coaches of all time. Individual stats also require teamwork but are a bit more indicative of individual greatness.
I loveeee Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind!! Thank you for the suggestions. :)
