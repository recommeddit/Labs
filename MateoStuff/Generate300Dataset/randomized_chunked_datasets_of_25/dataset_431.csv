36994,best roller coaster at six flags,"When are you going?  How busy it is will determine how many rides you can get and are you getting a flash pass?  Also do you visit a lot of parks or only a few every once in a while.  There’s a few different ways to look at it, but I would try to get in all of their good/unique rides, regardless of other people’s opinions l, because we all vary.  I would put them in tiers and pick from there moving down.  

So tier 1 of there most widely regarded and unique rides would be:
X2
Twisted Colossus
Tatsu
Full Throttle

Tier 2 is your good woodies, average B&Ms, something that would be a main attraction in the 90s:
Superman
Scream
Riddler
Apocalypse
Batman
Goliath

Tier 3 would be your older Arrow rides and smaller more tame rides, that have some fans and have some historical significance, but would be below average rides to most: 
Ninja
Revolution
Green Lantern
Viper
Gold Rusher

Unless you have a specific reason to hit any of the tier 3, like maybe wanna do Viper bc you haven’t done a late 80s arrow mega looper than you should most likely be able to get the tier 1 and 2 rides.  If you have to eliminate some Batman is cloned so if you have ridden a clone or will soon be able to skip that.  If you have ridden a bigger B&M standup (Mantis, Chang) and didn’t enjoy skip Ridler, if not you may want the experience.  All of the floorless are fairly similar so skip scream if you’ve done things like Medusa/dominator/bizzaro and thought meh.  Point being here it’s all about the B&Ms if your a big fan of their average rides hit these up, if not or you’ve ridden plenty of others go for the more unique ones like Superman, Goliath, etc."

34694,best NFL player,"I agree. I don't think there's anyone as iconic as LT. The dude single handedly revolutionized the game. Coaches had to adapt- to him. Linemen had to adapt- to him.

Put one person against LT? Enjoy your sack. Put two against him? He's still got a hand on your QB. Guy was an absolute monster, and I don't think we'll ever see someone impace the game the way he did, ever again."

Recently, I've been only running 4-6 miles at a time. Previously, my minimum mileage was at least 7 miles, upwards of 10-12 miles at a time... this was in my former life before having a child."
