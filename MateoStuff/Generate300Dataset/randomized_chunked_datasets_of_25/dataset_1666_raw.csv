"I didn’t like the shape for some reason, I couldn’t get comfortable on it day to day. It was like every time I used it my grip felt different, probably because it is just straight and doesn’t have much curves to it like the viper.... if the viper had a bigger hump and was slightly wider, it would probably be endgame for me"
