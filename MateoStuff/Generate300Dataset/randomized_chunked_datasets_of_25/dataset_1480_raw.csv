"Seconding ISL, R for Data Science, and Python Data Science Handbook - great resources.

On a different note - How to Win Friends and Influence People + similar.

It's easier than ever to get a grad who is strong technically - which  means it's starting to become a poor way to stand-out.

What's still relatively uncommon is somebody who can conduct themselves effectively.

In my experience - way more fresh analysts fail from developing a poor reputation leading to their recommendations being ignored than from needing to be better with Pandas and sklearn."
Bubblegum? How do you and general customers like that one?
I dont know how you do this. Everytime I drink with nothing but a protien shake in my belly I get really drunk and take a shit explosive enough to qualify for NASA.
I have that issue to with data randomly stop working.
Have both the black and saddle brown apple leather case for my iPhone X. Black is classy but kinda boring. Love the saddle brown and the patina that comes with it over time. I once fell out in love with the saddle brown but kinda love it again. So will probably get just one case for my iPhone 11 pro - Saddle brown apple leather case.
It's an incredibly Nolan-y film in just about every way so if you're generally a Nolan fan then you'll enjoy it quite a bit.
Inside Job is probably my favorite doc all time. Others notaea would be Who Killed the Electric Car and for a little comic relief Class Action Park

"Most Bishops actually get doctorates, Cardinal is just another honor that only allows them to vote on the Pope along with a few different responsibilities. 

And most priests get a degree in philosophy, it makes there be fewer classes in Seminary."

"So I have a fun Paul Rudd story.

I worked at CVS at the time, and my manager had just eliminated smoke breaks- so I'm on edge and going nuts.  Paul Rudd walks in, and sees me.

For reference- I am generally disheveled in appearance.  I had a wizard beard braided down almost to my nuts, and I had worked overnight unloading the truck before popping on register.

He looks at me and just goes- ""rough night?""  I laughed, nodded.  I slurped at my coffee, which was more or less empty at this point.  My boss comes out of the office to yell at me about something, and Paul drops what he's doing, runs to my counter, and rings the little bell to interrupt the boss.  I run over and he has a single butterfinger on the counter.

I ring him out, and he laughs.  He says- ""how long you been here?""  Truthfully, I told him- 10 hours.  I sputter something about loving him in ""Fundamentals of Caring.""  He looks at my boss and says the best thing ever.

""I need [my name] to help me to my car with my purchase.  My back hurts.  Mind taking over for him?""

So i go outside, he bums a cigarette off me, and bought me coffee- then wouldn't let me inside until i finished a whole cigarette and half my coffee.  Boss came out to bitch, he laughs and says ""I still need his help loading my car.""  Honestly, its actually probably the single best customer-moment I've ever had in my time in retail.

Dude's goddamn awesome."
"Also had my honeymoon at Sandals Whitehouse. Bars, pools, restaurants, staff, everything was a dream ! Singing at the Piano bar in the evening, campfire near the beach. 

You can hire a car to go to Treasure Beach or see this part of Jamaica, just try to avoid the potholes !"
yami no bansosha intrigues me. thanks a lot!

"Come to Texas!! I know that you mentioned Dallas, but I would suggest going to a city where there is more to do like Austin instead. There is a music festival every year called Austin City Limits that is pretty fun to go to, as well as a city-wide event called South by Southwest (SXSW) that is very unique as well. If you're looking for some good history, rent a car and drive down to San Antonio as well and pay the Alamo a visit. If you want to watch an NFL game, the Cowboys are in Dallas and the Texans are in Houston, but be aware that NFL tickets are not cheap (especially in Dallas). Dallas also has the Stars for the NHL, and those tickets are more reasonable and the game will probably be more fun. Just be aware that our summers are really hot (over 37 C is very common across Texas between late June and September). Along the way, try out some BBQ too!"
"Masters in Liberal Arts, it’s the graduate degree awarded by HES."
Maybe talk to someone in this [atlanta meetup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3e5iqu/atlanta_meetup_official_thread/)
Get the SE. Battery life shouldn’t be a problem if you are a digital minimalist. Mine tends to last me an entire day without much fuss and I use my phone often.

"If you mean how Calibre organizes the files within folders on your hard drive, then yyeah, I have to agree. I hate that ""black box"" style that the app chooses where the files are stored and the user shouldn't be nosing about in the folder tree. Iirc, that's how iTunes used to work. On balance, considering how well Calibre does everything else, I'm willing to overlook that detail.

I can't help think your issue with metadata on Android ereaders hasn't been brought up before. Have you [checked the forums on MobilRead](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/index.php) for a solution? The forum for Calibre is one of the biggest there and the developer is quite active. I use a Kobo ereader, so I can't offer much else.

In Calibre, you can nest subgenres within a genre by using dots. So ""Sci-Fi.Cyberpunk"" and ""Sci-Fi.Aliens"" will result with Cyberpunk and Aliens as two separate trees under a top level Sci-Fi genre. I can't help thinking there is a tool or plugin that allows syncing to a device according to a user's preference."
