"I am going full Roma this year, go win the title with our best manager ever! Good luck!"
Any particular one?
"Fallen was pretty good and totally unexpected.  It doesn‚Äôt get as much play as the Sixth Sense, but I‚Äôd argue the ending is just as good."
nice try keisha
"Nobody's drawing conclusions or trying to prove anything, we're basically saying that your initial statement was a little ambiguous. Thanks for finally clarifying.

Any chance you could point me in the direction of the mentioned studies? Thanks :)"
"Yeah, you'll have to compromise about 7 of your hand grenades to make up for the extra weight of the case.

Is it a fair tradeoff? I'd say, maybe."
"It has multiple actually. At least 2, but 3 in my opinion (depending on how you interpret the ending)."

"My top 3 pics are:
Firefly. A board game with multiple story options to play including Solo play. One game takes an hour or so. People who don't know the TV show (if those people exist) can still enjoy this game even if they don't understand how cool it is to acquire Jane and Janes hat.

Twilight Imperium. A game of intergalactic diplomacy and war. You'll be reading the rules for a while. If you want others to play with you allow them time to read the rules or send them a link to the rules online so they can read at their leisure before coming.  One game takes one day. Start by 10am latest.

Super Dungeon Explorer. You need bare minimum 3 people playing; 2 people to be the hero adventurers and one person to be the bad guy dungeon master handling all the monsters. A great game to start people on before introducing them to Dungeons and Dragons.  

There are card games such as Dragonwood, Splendor, Cards Against Humanity, Exploding Kittens, Kittens in a blender, Gloom and Fluxx. I also recommend keeping Uno around, it has lasted the ages."
"PEAKY BLINDERS!!!! This TV show is fucking crazy, mate! Amazing show!!! I can't express how good it is. Watch it. Season 5 is coming this November I believe."

I‚Äôve always gone caseless but I‚Äôd consider one if it had like extra strength MagSafe magnets. Worth the compromise for a stronger MagSafe wallet

"No way! I live in Peoria too! Well, one that's south of Chicago..."
"Whenever my life gets tough, I think about the eastern front, and what my grandparents went through during that period, and what the Jewish, Poles, hell everyone suffered under the Nazis.... tremendous perspective."

Hey thanks for the kind words!
"My great-grandfather passed his ""cure-all"" on to me when I was 12:

1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup strong black tea
1/2 cup Jack Daniels Whiskey

Mix, drink and repeat as needed. 

He said that it may not cure anything, but you won't really give a fuck after a few."
My parents used to have one of these. It was my favourite thing. Didn‚Äôt know they still made them :)
"Thanks for sharing, jarun/sablal. It's really appreciated that you write so much nice finished CLI tools"
"I've stayed at most of those and I think I agree with pretty much everything you wrote. Hampton used to be our go-to, but now it's becoming Hyatt Place. As chains go, I love staying at Embassy the most."
