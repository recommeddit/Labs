25226,"It depends really what you mean, because I think Tobey McGuire was the perfect Ditko inspired Peter Parker. Whenever I rewatch that first Raimi film it just has so much old school cheese to it than I can't imagine it any other way really. His Spider-Man also had some appropriately fitting cheesy lines but I really don't think Tobey is a good voice actor. Presumably the Spider-Man lines are dubbed over and his delivery always sounds strange, as they do whenever he did the video game stuff. 

When TASM came out I really liked Andrew's Peter, but after I met some wannabe edgy hipsters who clearly took inspiration from his design I just couldn't take him seriously. Shit like him riding the skateboard in school feels so painfully dated. Plus things like him ruining a kid's internship at Oscorp doesn't sit well with me on rewatches. That said his Spider-Man was perfect, I wish he still had the chance to be the character.

Tom Holland though is a perfect modern Spider-Man. He embodies the best of both worlds. I think his Peter Parker feels so real because he isn't some ""of the times"" character like the hipster from TASM, he's just such an everyman, which is exactly what Peter needs to be. He has a few friends, he's a bit of a loser to many (his interests for example being building a Death Star) and he's just excited to have something like Spider-Man in his life. 

The way I see it, Tobey is a perfect classic Spider-Man both as Peter and the webhead, Andrew's Peter Parker feels like what a studio of middle aged men think is the new and hip fellow kid whilst his Spider-Man feels like Tom Holland's Spider-Man but all grown up. Holland's Peter Parker feels perfectly like an average guy and his Spider-Man is so young and inexperienced it feels hard to compare him with the others but you can just see him growing up like Garfield's Spider-Man who feels tonally pretty similar however he has a bit more experience to him.",best spiderman actor

My go-to at a standard bar is a White Russian, which is essentially cream, Kahlua, and a little vodka. It tastes like a creamy vanilla coffee. Sometimes when I want to stay very sober, I ask for it without vodka.
