"The spiciest, sourest Hot and Sour soup. Mmmm, that drain."
"Clorox or Lysol wipes here. 

I lived without them for 40 years but once I had them, I‚Äôm finding life difficult without them. And making my own just isn‚Äôt the same."
Cheesecake. I send the man a cheesecake. He loves it more than anything. There's sites online that sell nice ones and ship them frozen.
"Like I said, massive brand loyalty!"
"I‚Äôm not sure what you do, but I feel like you should have an art history degree. Or perhaps just a history degree. Now you may work with art non profit organizations.
These will be random, and I‚Äôm just gonna stick with them and be ‚Äúloud and wrong.‚Äù ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"I have similar, if not identical cans. I've had them for years and they show few signs of giving up anytime soon. I've abused them somewhat, but the sound quality is still great. I'll definitely check out Panasonics the next time I need cans."
"Cheers to having Fred Flinstone feet, brother!"
"If it's part of your calculus how employees are treated, Lowe's is generally considered a better employer than Home Depot, and Menard's owner is, well,  you can look him up.  A bit of a tool, himself.  I have noticed that that not all Lowe's are equal quality in both service and quality of products."
"Sure, if you want to risk a fraud charge."
"I prefer axios because it treats all 400 class responses as errors, which is usually the behavior I want. With fetch I have to wrap each request in a handler to do that."
"Question for you, I brush twice daily for long enough according to you. I also use mouth wash, Crest Complete, but still get cavities. Is there a reason?"
"It has to be Tom Brady as much as it pains me to say it. For everyone saying Jerry Rice, yes, he is the greatest WR to play the game. But he also had Joe Fucking Montana AND Steve Young tossing the ball to him.

When it comes down to it, it's all about the Superbowl and Brady has made it 8 fucking times. That is the record for Superbowl visits for any position. And the next highest QB is John Elway with 5. And Brady isn't even done yet."
"i don't know if it's like this throughout the country, but I took world history my sophomore year, where we basically learned about the wars that had nothing to do with American history."
Big trouble is an all time fave of mine
Don‚Äôt Fuck With Cats. It‚Äôs really dark and messed up.
"I know this isnt the question, but I feel its something to consider. you could get a steam link and a bluetooth controller and PC game from the couch. Or just put your PC by your TV. If all of your friends are on PC I'd just stay there... use the money you saved to buy some new games. 

Unless there is a very specific list of console exclusives you want to play. Then just get the console with the most exclusives."
"A hand made photo album filled with pictures of all the favorite moments that you shared with him or family, with handwritten captions. I made one for Father's Day this year and he was wild about my gift. He keeps it in his locked safe because he said it's one of the most valuable possessions he's ever received - memories, locked away for safekeeping."
Hot weather = more outdoor activities and less clothes so people are incentivized to get in shape and look more attractive. I guess that‚Äôs why Southern Florida and California have some of the best looking people.
"Lot's of good advice here. I came here with the impulse to say, ""learn piano first"", but really there's no reason to put all of your eggs in one basket. You have a couple instruments at your disposal. Spend a little time with each learning the basics and focus more on whichever you have the most fun playing."
"i imagine i smell like 'nothing' when i'm clean, being clean doesn't have a scent its just nothing, that's how i feel about myself anyhow"
I tried to see it. How do I proceed with it?
"Well, Volvic for one is named and still produced in the town on the same name in the Auverne region of France dominated by extinct volcanoes. Malvern water comes from a spring in the Malvern Hills in England

Now in the good old days, each of the French sources tasted really quite different. I remember as a child in the 70s travelling in France and Volvic was **very** mineralised and quite sulphurous. Today most mineral waters you get commercially shipped overseas seem to taste the same - of very little."
Agreed. :) The violence was a bit unjustified here and there for me but otherwise very exciting.
My parents always tell me engineering would be helpful for any kind of job. Cause you're good at math and all that stuff
"gvim... it's vim, what else could you ask for?"
