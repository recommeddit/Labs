6663,best iPhone,Went from se to se2 and it works great for a all day user. Could use a bigger battery of course. Battery is 90% after a year and a half so that sucks and AppleCare does Not replace batteries for free.
23237,best social networking site for CS,"why would you spend time on social media or make effort for it? anybody who will pay attention to you / look for you will look at your profile and say ""I FOUND A DEVELOPPER!"", wants to know what you can do (=website, linkedin profile with your information on it) and then look at your github profile and activity.

For networking however, twitter, reddit and co are your best options, maybe specialized linked groups - however most people rather use facebook groups nowadays. 

you are selling yourself, so fully go with your own profile / name."

69258,best major to study in college,"In my senior year, currently finance major, would have done accounting or double majored fin/acc if I had to start over today.

Finance is something that has 3 distinct types of work, 1. securities, 2. corp fin. 3. transaction services Ie Banking. Unless you're doing securities an accounting degree supplemented with your own outside resources is much better, especially if you want to go high finance."

67107,best places to skydive in california,"Did my AFF / A license at Elsinore and can't recommend them enough. Small enough to feel like you're getting the attention you need but big enough to have planes going up rapidly with little waiting.

Gear rental was included in the price when I did it. Think at most I had to wait maybe an hour for instructors to be done with other students, but that was usually just on the weekends. Usually got \~3 jumps in on a weekend and more on weekdays. After AFF Level 4 I managed to get more and more jumps in during the days since you go down to just one instructor, and solos went even faster.

On weekends and some Fridays they also have Post AFF Coaches that are free to jump with while you're getting your A license. Not sure if it's a common thing at other places too, but it was super helpful for me at least and I did almost all my solo jumps with these coaches."

26912,best board games,"Sorry if this has been brought up before, but I think expandalones/ game families should be grouped together. In a year or two three of the top ten games will probably be Gloomhaven, Jaws of the Lion (also Gloomhaven), and Frosthaven (another Gloomhaven)."

16553,best pet for toddlers,"> two cats

> a rabbit (or small mammal), some sort of reptile

> I remember we had one that was a dick and would pick on/kill the other 

Given the above, I can't possibly imagine what could go wrong with the animals in your house. You are quite literally setting up the circle of life with the cats and the small mammals (or the snake and small mammals!). When the two year old lets the small mammal or small reptile loose, the cats might pounce.

I know in some cases there can be inter-species socialization but you could be teaching your son quite a lesson.

I'd stand pat with the cats before adding any more to the mix, unless you want them for you and only for you."
30775,best country to live in,"Canada hands down: As long as you don't go to Quebec or Saskatchewan.
