42590,"Castle --- maybe.  I find myself drawn to it.  I liked it when it was on in broadcast initially.  Now, stuck mostly alone during this pandemic, and teleworking, and putting the tv on in the background to break the dead silence in my apartment or to block out the dork above me constantly banging around with his weightlifting at every hour, but I've run out of stuff.  So Castle is on Lifetime now.

I still enjoy it, but it's so predictable.  And half the episodes almost the same exact method of finding the killer.  They get a picture of the killer searching the traffic cameras, they track his credit card or phone records, they get someone to confess to one of the smaller crimes that was key in the string of events leading up to the murder, but they vehemently deny they murdered anyone.  This person then says ""I want to see a lawyer.""  And Beckett rolls her eyes, like ""ah, shit, I almost had him ready to admit the murder, but he came up with the clever idea to ask for a lawyer.""  But Beckett books him anyway.  Oh, but wait, there is still 12 minutes left.  So they are back to normal life and something happens and Castle stands up straight like he's being shocked and he realizes the clue that they had missed to date but had been right in front of them the whole time.  So they cut to a scene where they go and talk to the actual murderer as if they are just coming to give them an update, then they acuse them, the killer keeps denying, they show them the physical evidence, the killer says ""this is silly, you will never be able to prove it.""  Then, they show their final piece of evidence, and then the killer finally admits it and explains why they had to do it, conveniently laying out all the rest of the info that the prosecutor will need to solidify a conviction.

I doubt that last part ever happens, but I do wonder.  Maybe they do try to lay out their theory to the accused murderer so that the murderer does give up all the details that they have had on their chest since the killing and the cops are hoping they will have a complete confession then... who knows.  But it's funny that no matter what, almost every case follows that exact same pattern on Castle.",best detective show

55253,"Newfound Gap to Fontana Dam or Iron Mt Gap to 19E (goes over Roan Highlands) are both hikes which can be done in two or three nights.  Would need transport for both ends as not loops but if you do not have two cars, shuttle services are out there.  Both are on the AT and I think the Smokies you need to reserve shelter spots in advance or did when I did it a few years ago.  Both fun hikes.  Boone, NC is near Roan Highlands and a cool town.  Grandfather Mt is nearby and cool too.  Smokies has so much stuff in it and nearby.  Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Dragons Trail near Fontana Dam, Dollywood, etc.",best places to hike in the east coast
