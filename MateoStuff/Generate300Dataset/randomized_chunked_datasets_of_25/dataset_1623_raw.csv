"Fellow scientist/academic, came here to say exactly this. Never draw conclusions from one study.

Regarding reviews and might be obvious - several reviews might be written on the same subject. *Try to always find the most recent one*, if it's a well-studied subject you might find critically different data."

"Should be easy to get tickets to the Titans.

Tennessee might seem to be an unusual choice but it is actually a great idea! Good food, music, etc. Nashville is the worldwide nexus of country music recording, and Memphis is a very important Blues music town.

There's some nutty hotel in Memphis that has duck bellhops or something like that. Also I think there's gambling.

Little Rock, AR is a do-able drive from Memphis if you rent a car and you could go to the Bill Clinton Presidential Library.

I don't know about Nashville but outside of heavily traveled downtown areas, both Memphis and Little Rock can be a little bit dangerous from a crime standpoint.

Oh yeah, any Simpsons fan wants to see Nashville's Fabulous Sun Sphere (it still exists)."

"Mach E and ID.4 both look like good entries in the EV market.  Ford and VW will have incentives to get these off the lot, let's see these on the road."

"Zero has only a touch more control over otsu v2. I'd say 5/5 control for zero and 4.5/5 for otsu v2 on control. Speed for otsu I'd give a little over 3/5 whereas zero is a solid 2/5. Otsu v2 is basically hien speed with comfy surface and more control than a hien üëç.

I'd say try zero only if you want a bit more control."

"Canada isn't a terrible country. I'd rather live here than much of the world. But there are plenty of European countries that are a lot better. There are lots of faults with Canada that most immigrants don't see as they have rose coloured glasses on looking at Canada like the promised land.

Transportation systems here are horrendous. Unless you live in downtown of major cities a vehicle is essential to get anywhere.

The suburbs of major cities are just neighbourhoods of houses for kilometres with nothing else. Parks are just pieces of grass with nothing else in them with exception of a few such as High Park or Edwards Gardens in Toronto.

There is little culture, beautiful buildings, and restaurants for the most part are the same chains over and over again which aren't very good. Housing is very expensive in major cities and there's nothing in small towns. Crime is higher than most of Europe but Canadians only compare themselves to the United States so they think the crime is low."

"I looked pretty hard at the Niro EV too and if Hyundai hadn't soured things it was a real contender. From everything I looked at they were damn near the same vehicle but with a different battery supplier, a longer wheelbase on the Niro, and like 2 or 3 options differences. The lifetime warranty that Hyundai gives you on the Kona is a big selling point too though. The discounts that Bolts are apparently starting to see is what I'm hoping to see more of in another few years. Since they're no longer the only mainstream long-range EV in that price range they need to work harder to make sales. Though the phasing out of the rebates might hurt that..."
"Henry A Wallace, a progressive champion who was FDR's third-term VP and was almost president himself had he not lost the spot to Truman for the 4th term. He was pro-New Deal, wanted to end segregation in the 40s, was a spiritualist and theosophist, a controversial Ag secretary during the dust bowl, and someone who wanted to head off the cold war by normalizing relations with the USSR."
For sure! Considering the tax write off for my solar system and my school I won‚Äôt be paying taxes for awhile! Haha

"Oh man, those are awesome looking, I saw one in a store once that had been taken excellent care of, so the price was incredibly high. But the colors are very pretty. I used to have a Carmona Retusa (also known as Fukien tea tree) but it died because I didn't take proper care of it, now I have a new bonsai, though I forgot which species it is (it looks somewhat similar, but it has no white flowers and the leaves aren't as pointed) that is still alive after about a year, although I really need to trim it one day, but I lost my bonsai scissors, so I'm going to buy a new pair in a few days."
