"Manning has more games played and played most of his career indoors. 

you can't look at the player Brady has been since 2007 and seriously say that Manning was better. At best they've been equal, but if you care about ball security Brady is better."
"I'm not familiar with the O'Reilly book, but all of statistics is a course in mathematical statistics. I would recommend a normal course in stats before tackling math stats, as it requires quite a bit of time and calculus know how"

"I'm guessing there are people that live in places with frequent and extended power outages. In the last 30 years where I live I've never lost power for more than 30 minutes and that happened once in that time. I live in the midwest with storms during the summer months and ice and snow in the winters. But the part of the city I live in has most all the electrical lines running underground. So any outages we've had were usually some transformer that blew which gets fixed rather quickly or rolls over to some other segment of the grid.

So for me I wouldn't buy something for that particular feature because I would likely never use it. But there are older parts of the city I'm in where every year people experience extended power outages from summer storms or ice in the winter. Might make sense for them to have something like this. Though the reality is the people in those areas of the city likely can't afford something like a Ford Lightning."
