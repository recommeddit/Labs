"it's more to do with the game physics, arcade style games are designed to be not frustrating for people with no real-life fast driving experience and are designed to be totally playable with a gamepad. Car handling is usually greatly simplified, using the brake is often optional other than for hairpin bends, it's hard to go into a spin unless you screw up.

Sim games are designed from the ground up to have as reallistic physics as possible and to be played with a steering wheel, pedals and shifter. They are much more unforgiving, like real life, so it's easy to lose control of the car and going fast takes a lot of skill and practice. For many people it's too frustrating and they don't find it fun."
"Are you okay with JRPGs? If so, Trails of Cold Steel 1, 2, and 3 might be up your alley as they are semi open world."
What about a dwarf fruit tree!!?  I am currently digging those for my backyard
"Chrome, except if they do remove ad blockers, then Firefox"
All their names are pretty great. Lady Vengeance and Mad Madame are my favorites.
"Obviously this is a joke, but garlic is sold in pill form as a nutritional supplement."
Probably the new Finalmouse
I really disagree. You can practice 10 hours a day and get no progress. Knowing how to keep your practice time productive is a skill. Time does not equal skill.
"Hot lemon and real, raw, unpasteurized honey. The honey is the most important part! Can't stress that enough. 
That and enough weed to make sleeping it off easy as pie."
"Thanks for the great list! I'd love to share my collection and hope it's helpful

"In passing, the UALALALALALALALALALA ACTION! movie is apparently a REAL THING. I think I might have to order it, to go along with my collection of gonzo and fucked up -xploitation movies from the 70s. Mondo Cane, Brotherhood of Death, Werewolves on Wheels, that sort of thing."
"The Vieux Carre. A New Orleans Manhattan, essentially. An ounce each of rye whiskey (I like High West), sweet vermouth (Carpano is very good here, but you could also use Lillet), and cognac (I use Ansac for mixing). 2 dashes each peychauds and Angostura bitters, stirred and strained into a Benedictine-rinsed glass. Add a couple of rocks if you like, and garnish with a cherry or twist of orange. Or don't. Sip."
"It's not a newspaper, but I read AP just about every morning. Stick to ""top news"", and avoid ""big story"", though. The content of their articles is comprehensive and fact-based, but the stories they choose to report is a little iffy sometimes; they're quick to jump on bandwagons (for example, they're so eager to crucify cops that it seems they report on every officer-involved homicide, and have even strayed into non-lethal shootings where the suspect was armed and threatening the officer).

I generally cross NYTimes (non-opinion articles) with AP and the usual googling to get a picture of stories unfolding."
"What is the exact budget?

GPU performance can be greatly improved with about $20 extra, so getting as close to budget as possible may yield the best results"
"I was blown away when I went to visit my girlfriends home town in upstate and we drove to Ithaca. Holy shit it's so beautiful. 

Lakes, waterfalls, flowers, vines, huge farms and vineyards. I felt like such a dumbass- being from Colorado I assumed NY was just an overpopulated city but western and upstate NY are gorgeous"
Thank you! I was told it runs hot but I heard there’s a handful of ways to fix it on YouTube! I just got my hands on it!
Just dream up some small project and try to implement it.  That should make it more obvious.
"*John Dies at the End* made the list but Asimov didn't. I don't know how to feel about that.

Oh, wait. Yes. Yes, I do."
Thanks Kevin. I'm really excited. :)
"I wasn't trying to say the sound is important, just that I enjoy it really. I've doodled a lot on my friends before buying my own, I can't feel a difference same grip to the pencil same softness level. On past matte i've dealt with some do tend to have larger grain (not sure if that the right term for it) which leads to better picture quality but definitely makes it less soft. I've only experienced these two so I can speak on the quality of any other US based ones though. 

If my main use wasn't drawing I would have put a tempered on it personally but since I draw for hours every day I can agree with you there."
"am flutist... srsly bro it takes 10 seconds

  
also piccolo... very accurate

&#x200B;

also sax... i like being taken seriously and i dont like jazz"
Sweet jesus.
Love the game pass mentality. BRO ITS A BETTER DEAL YOU SHOULD DO IT! When you pick a game do you pick the one that’s the absolute cheapest or do you pick the one that you actually want to play? Forking over hundreds of dollars over time to RENT games that you aren’t even going to play 90% of is so shortsighted and silly.
Enter the void
I think Pakistan would have had a better line up in the 90s for sure.
