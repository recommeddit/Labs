I for one love Reese Peanut Butter cups"
"That's a real fathers pride, cause you hand made it and thought of what he liked he will always carry it with him as it will remind him that he did a good job in raising you.  To you it might be ugly and worthless but to him it is more precious than gold and not something you would understand until your own child gives you something handmade without help and being told too."
That‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs always nice to know that people are cool !   I loved the series and the several twists.    It‚Äôs fun to have an unexpected ending.
Found which 2 lists i should follow then =P
A group called ‚ÄúThe siege‚Äù. Those 2 guys make bangers.

"I would put UT Austin and Georgia Tech higher but other than that I agree with this list more than any other ranking list. That being said, I don‚Äôt really know a ton about every school so I can‚Äôt really say this with certainty."
Keralis is probably one I would single out (unless you want to learn everyone‚Äôs name) as a really good watch for being an incredibly talented builder and very funny with a lot of subtle jokes.
"Admob is certainly the easiest to integrate. Mopub is a decent alternative. Amazon ads are okay, with the plus side that you do not have to rely on Google Play Services as you do with Admob. I would probably just go with Admob due to its ease of integration."

"New Balances. Also, can‚Äôt go wrong with a book"
Why? Rumour recently suggests the successor to 11 will be oled in 2020. Probably inaccurate though.
"I worked at a Coldstone for a few years. Mix cake batter with chocolate ice cream, then add in cookie dough and brownie. Trust me.

Or if you‚Äôre a fruity person take cake batter, yellow cake, whipped cream and strawberries. Strawberry shortcake ice cream.

I could go all day."
"Wholesalers often make cash sales to the public at significant savings. For instance, I only buy screws from a fastener supply place, because their price is usually about 1/3 the retail price. Box stores make zero money on drywall for instance, and make all their profit on the screws and accessories."
Piano or drums.
Tickled is a rabbit hole of insanity that just keeps going.
"Yayyyy! You‚Äôre so spot on!! I love pop culture and music! Carly Rae Jepsen used to be my jam üíì but Taylor Swift will forever be my #1 <3. And yes lol, I don‚Äôt believe in astrology but it‚Äôs still so much fun to look at, my friends and I love sharing astrology memes with one other and using it to look at & compare our compatibilities with our partners‚Äô signs üòÜ (again, just for fun!!)"
