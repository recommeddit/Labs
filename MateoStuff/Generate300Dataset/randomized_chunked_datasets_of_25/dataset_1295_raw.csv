"So much work has gone into this! Thank you!

Really bad that I've read about 90% of the list. That still leaves 10% to enjoy!"
"The WH-1000XM4 was routinely listed as the best consumer-grade noise cancelling wireless headphones when I was shopping last year. I don't have a frame of reference with other headphones, but I'm pretty happy with my pair."

"Keyboard instruments are very approachable because you can just press the key and it makes the sound you want

To make a good sound on wind instruments or string instruments, it takes some technique and practice. For fretless string instruments, you also need to learn and practice being in tune

In contrast to that, you always keep the same hand position with wind instruments, unlike piano where you might have big jumps and have to play with both hands

I don't think you can really pick an easiest instrument to play, as naturally, players and composers always push the limits of what's possible on the instrument so all instruments can be very difficult

You could probably day what instrument is the most approachable/easiest at the start"
"You should talk to a pharmacist (just walk into CVS, Walgreens, Duane read, etc and ask at the counter). 

But from my own experience:

1) yes. Our sinuses were not designed for us to be upright so we have poor drainage. Poor drainage leads to inflammation. Inflammation leads to completely blocked sinuses. Completely blocked sinuses lead to infections. 

2) an anti-histamine is not a cold remedy per se, but rather it's used to treat a symptom of a cold (runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing, etc). Same as allergies. But it's only 1 piece of the puzzle. 

3) I'll most likely end up with bronchitis if I get a cold. But what was nearly 100% certainty is now better since I use the correct medication to avoid getting really sick. 

4) that's the general idea. Stop the runny nose at the start and the rest of the cold (sinuses, coughing, chest cold) can be diminished or avoided."

Twister smoked Phoenix for me this past weekend and I loved Phoenix. Both are in my top 15 now. Knoebels is amazing.

"> It's a shame that Fiji and Flint both have shitty governments that won't fix their water pipes, but that's basically irrelevant for a discussion regarding bottled water. Neither place is running out of clean water, they just have decided not to pump it to their residents. The residents should rise up and do something about it, I know I would.

They have risen up (unless you mean grab some guns and overthrow the government).  It doesn't work. Look at the months and months of protests around the country just to get cops to stop choking people to death...so far that has not produced results.

Perhaps they will but what you ask is no small or simple thing.  History is littered with people trying this.  Sometimes they succeed.  Always at great cost."
"I adore The House on the Cerulean Sea! It's one of my favorite novels that I've read this year.
I got the impression that TJ Klune's other novels were more YA though. Is this accurate?"
"Percussion involves a lot of techniques, different instruments, and proper training that you don't just serendipitously stumble upon, but honestly, it _does_ take less time to become a percussion player in a very reputable symphonic orchestra, than it takes to become a string instrumentalist in one. Ideally, violinists for example start as early as possible, way before they are teenagers, if the point is to become a serious professional one. A percussionist can start later and still end up working in a reputable orchestra. Less casual pursuits are a different thing and it doesn't mean that people can't become _good_ by starting later, but you can truly compare the difficulty levels and _required training_ by looking at a reputable classical orchestra where the competition is tough and you can't just create new symphony orchestras out of whim if you don't qualify to join existing ones, like you could do with bands."

"By the same logic Liverpool winning two more CLs is irrelevant as well, as United has CLs too, just two less than Liverpool."
