"Just use response.ok. Which will be true for any 200 range response and false for any other.

The fact that fetch doesnt throw an error with a 404 for example is perfectly valid. 404 is a valid response, not an error. This is where Axios actually gets it wrong imho. The dev should determine when a response should throw an error, not the library."
"_insert question no one asked yet is still interesting_

This is what my dentist told me probably contributed to my gingivitis. He reccomended I pay for a 500 dollar procedure and I thought it was a scam. Well my parents paid for it anyways and after that i've been brushing and flossing every day. Next time I show up they do the gum count numbers and they're prisitine- no charge.
