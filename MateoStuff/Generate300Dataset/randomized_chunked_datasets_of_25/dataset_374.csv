Use them consistently for at least several weeks to a month. It takes awhile for the ingredient to build up in the tiny tubules (holes) that you have in root structure. If you haven't been to a dentist in a bit, make sure there isn't decay that is causing the sensitivity.",best toothpaste

33859,"Okay,so generally it's considered that HeartGold/SoulSilver are one of the contenders of the best PokÃ©mon title,although you probably should play Red/Blue/Green/Yellow or their remakes FireRed/LeafGreen before them.


So another one that is generally considered one of the best PokÃ©mon games is Platinum,which is what I recommend you play next.



Black 2/White2 are also some of the best games in the series,but you need to play Black/White before them,which are also highly praised.But they only contain Unova PokÃ©mon till the post-game,so maybe you should get Platinum first to first learn more about the previous PokÃ©mon?Or maybe not.




There is also Emerald,the third version of Ruby/Sapphire,and there are also their remakes OmegaRuby/AlphaSapphire.Some say Emerald is better and others think ORAS is better.I personally recommend playing ORAS instead of Emerald,and you can go play that one later.




I think that's about it for now.You should go play Platinum.:)",best Pokemon game

7492,"Dear legos45,

How would you rate AORUS 15P YD-73US244SH? I went to a laptop store and this was the best performance overprice they have there. I am switching from Mac to PC. I want a gaming laptop that can run any game very well even at ultra settings and will last for at least 5 years (aka able to play any new game that comes out the next 5 years). My max budget, for now, would be 2400 USD. I am still hesitant with AORUS 15P YD-73US244SH because it is 3080 8gb instead of 3080 16gb. Your guidance is very much appreciated! Thank you!

Edit: I am also hesitant with GS7611257 (since similar price). It has Core i9-11900H and 3070 8gb 95W max (a better CPU with lower GPU). For Aorus, it has i7-11800H but 3080 8gb at 130W max (a lower CPU with a better GPU).

Going for these as these are currently available when compared to others which requires like 2+ months",best laptop for general use
4129,"Not a hiring person, but generally if it's from an accredited program, it's the same as any other degree. You don't have to explain where you got it unless it's from a very recognizable ""diploma mill"" institution like University of Phoenix. 

I'm completing my bachelor's online through a local college. I chose it specifically because it's an actual brick-and-mortar institution that I can physically go to if I have an issue, which means a flesh-and-blood teacher and staff that I can talk to. Granted, I haven't been there physically in over two years -I'm what you'd call a turtle-paced undergrad, only taking 6 credits at a time. It's all I can afford, and all I can take mentally with working a full-time job. But hey, end result is going to be the same either way. 

I'm looking at doing my master's degree through John Hopkins University, and their program is online as well. When I get my M.A. it won't read ""JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY - FAKE-ASS PUSSY DIVISION"", it'll just say the name of the school. I'll still be doing real-life internships as well as a two-week onsite seminar to get hands-on experience, and I'll be volunteering a lot as well.",best online college
