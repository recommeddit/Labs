35493,"So picture this: WW1 battle, muddy trenches... On the French side we see officers sitting at a clean table with clean chairs on a clean rug in the muddy trench. Legs crossed, sipping from mugs, and a butler standing by the table waiting for orders. On the table we have a bowl of fresh lemons, a sugar cube box, and 2 bottles of champagne, and 1 bottle of gin.

I'm absolutely certain that this happened. In a Monty Python skit.",best alcoholic drink

2574,"I would tend to agree, overall. When I recommend that people buy (circumaural) headphones, I tend to advice them to spend in a $200-400 range, which tends to cover both the holy triumvirate and a number of very solid mid-end options (Mad Dogs, Focals, a number of quite competent Audio-Technicas, etc), including room for an amp with most of the headphones that require one. Indeed, I wrote a big ol' wall of text a while back justifying quality headphones based on price/hour of listening specifically to validate the $200-400 range to folks with doubts.

I think that IEMs might range just a bit more, perhaps - maybe $100-200, since that ranges from the really solid price/performance $100ish options (SE215, RHA M750i, VC1000,) to the cheaper end of the high end (DN-1000, Custom Art Music One), but that's just me.",best headphones

27021,"For a long time BGer like me, Wingspan scratches an itch that I feel like we hadn't had in a LONG time.  

Early on, gateway games (Catan/Carcassone) were more complex than the gateways we see today (Codenames/Secret Hitler) and also fill a different need.  Today's gateways are made to make new converts into the gaming world, where 10-15 years ago you were playing Catan because you were always a bit nerdy but didn't realize these types of games existed.

Because of this, he early bridge between a gateway and something more complex and meaty was a game like Wingspan.  Introduced more complex strategies and ideas like card engines that would have been a bit more advanced for a gateway game.  You'd use this type of game to move towards the ones that would be combining everything you'd learned up to this point to dive in deep.

Today the idea if a gateway is more simplified (party games) and that moves a game like Catan or Azul into that mid-range.  Until Wingspan I feel like we didn't have much to jump between Azul and Scythe or Feast For Odin.",best board games

Kevin Hart was a total jackass that didn't want to be bothered, went out of his way to make sure nobody talked to him or got near him and just had the worst holier-than-thou attitude.",best celebrity
