49609,best gaming monitor,I've been gaming for years and I recently got a gaming monitor which was 144hz. I had been using 60 hz on my old monitor. A week after I got the 144 hz monitor I changed the refresh rate to it. I didn't think it would change much but. Holy shit the difference is so noticeable. 60 hz really makes it hard to play competitively in fps games.
33878,best Pokemon game,"They are all really fun games in my opinion. Itâ€™s hard to pick just one. You should watch some gameplay videos on YouTube to decide which one you think is the most interesting. But, no matter what you pick, you canâ€™t really go wrong."
8098,best toothpaste,"Not sure if this is true, but I heard that back when they first started making toothpaste with fluorine, 9/10 dentists recommended it. So when the commercials say that 9/10 dentists recommend this product, ""this product"" is actually any toothpaste containing fluorine. They just make it sound like its their specific brand."

5645,best programming language for web development,"JavaScript, Html, css for front-end. I would suggest Asp.Net core MVC (C#)  for back-end."
16956,best iOS game,"Yeah, but more than just touch. The ease with which you can hook up a PS4 or Xbox controller and how that levels up a large number of excellent AAA titles on iOS is a great story."

11344,best gifts for dad,"Not trying to toot my own horn too much, but I nailed the gift that I gave to my dad 13 years ago.

I was headed into my junior year of high school and had no money since I played baseball all summer instead of getting a job. On the way to a game one Sunday afternoon, my dad brought up that it was Father's Day (I think that I remembered, but we never made a big to-do about those minor holidays). He gave me a hard time about not getting a gift since he knew that I had no cash and that macaroni art would be a little creepy coming from a 15 year old.

I joked right back that it was my day to pitch and that I'd throw him a no-hitter. I was always a decent player, but had never done anything like that before...

...and damned if I didn't throw my only no-hitter that day.

Neither of us are too emotional, but I could see in his eyes how cool of a moment it was when we hugged after the game. Maybe someday I'll make some money and buy him all of the gadgets that he really wants, but I don't think I'll ever top that day.

TL;DR - My dad and I are both baseball nuts. I threw a no-hitter with him in the crowd on Father's Day. I think it was a pretty awesome gift."

427,best terminal file manager reddit,"If using a full DE, whatever file manager comes with it.

If using a WM, pcmanfm and ranger. Always good to have one GUI and one CLI just in case."
66046,best college in california,"This is unrelated to the post, but Harvard should not be in the top ten. Honestly, Harvard produces the worst people imaginable. People hell bent on destroying democracy. People like Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo, and the lying Kayleigh McEnany. So many awful people who don't know right from wrong. 

Harvard should forever be known as a terrible institution that produces the worst people in our society."
40275,best midrange CPU,"There's not going to be a great deal of difference to be honest. Will you be running NVME? If so, go with 11700k or 5600X, pcie4 NVME is a lot faster than the pcie3 that the 10700k has. Here's a comparison of the 5800x, 10700k and 11700k, gaming performance of the 5600x should be on par as most games are GPU bound. https://www.techspot.com/review/2261-ryzen-5800x-vs-core-11700k-vs-10700k/"
