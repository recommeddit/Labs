"I definitely used the guardian ranking as well as the times' when I was picking unis - and as you'd say, the filter by subject can be a very useful feature.
I would say though that having read through the Times website linked by OP, it seems like the Times are using most, if not all, the criteria you have listed. 
I think that means the main difference here is that the guardian ranking is a student satisfaction/experience/ teaching ranking, where the Times is more focussed on research.
Also, I can only imagine trying to accurately compare internationally must be more difficult than comparisons for a single country where the education system, class sizes, finances etc etc are at least broadly similar."
"I graduated with my BBA back in December. I think the biggest obstacle in my job hunt now is geography. Here are a few tips from me, if I had to do it all over:

* **Go to school in an area that has plenty of jobs and businesses around.** There's nothing around here but an outlet mall and insurance offices, so all of my experience is retail, with a year as a teller at a bank. Trying to get a job closer to the city is pretty hard, because I hadn't cultivated another skill that would make me stand out or make me useful. Thankfully, I've always been good with computers, and I've done a lot of repair on the side with them. I'll be taking my A+ exam here in the next week or so, so I'll get rolling on my way into the tech industry. So, if you do go for your BBA, you need to be in an area where you can get a solid internship. The coursework wasn't very hard, in my opinion. This is an opportunity for you to take a look at the current job market and see what companies are looking for. 

* **MINOR IN SOMETHING.** I was going to double major in Marketing, but I ended up dropping it because I wanted to graduate sooner, among other things. All the work I put into getting to those marketing classes I could have put towards a minor, which I didn't have. If your school has a good music program, do music. You can minor in a specific instrument and get some great training if you'd like. Accounting or CompSci would be a great minor as well, from what I've seen.

Now, a short list of pros and cons:

Pros:

*  **You will become an extrovert.** While many other classes do this as well, Business classes especially focus on class participation and working with groups. A lot. You will find yourself in a group in just about every class. You will have to meet up outside of class to do homework. Groups are life to you now. You'll fake it until you find yourself enjoying it. Or you'll contemplate suicide. Whatever.

* **You will learn how to lead and motivate a group.** There are no set group leaders. If you want to get good grades, someone has to step up and assign people. Sometimes, the whole group will do this, and everything will go great and there will be few problems. Other times, no one will. This is where you have to step up, dish out roles, and stay on top of people until the project is done and delivered.

* **You will have professors from wildly varying backgrounds.** In my experience, professors who teach Business classes don't need to be as strictly credentialed as say, more disciplined sciences. I had a professor who was working as the Operations Managers of the school. Ex-military, lawyers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs. Thousands of different stories and hundreds of years of cumulative knowledge, all right in front of you. If you take the time to talk to them outside of class, they are an indispensable source of wisdom that you absolutely NEED to take advantage of, for your own sake. 

* **You will learn a wide range of different skills.** Business Management isn't a set skill in itself, it's an amalgam of different disciplines. Yes, you will learn management techniques and the like, but you'll also pick up a lot from leadership, accounting, business law, HR management, psychology, marketing, manufacturing, operations, advertising, and statistics. That's not even a full list, but what I'm saying is, you're going to have a huge base of information to draw from.

* **You will learn to compromise and prioritize like a pro.** There will be weeks where you have three huge projects due, and you know you can't get them all done. You'll have to know which ones will hurt you more if you skimp on them, and make sure those get ample attention. Some you will just have to ignore and not complete. This is the nature of Business school. It sucks sometimes, but compromising and prioritizing are skills that will go a long way in the real world.

Cons:

* **You will have to deal with shitty classmates and team members.** This part sucks, and it sucks a lot. You will have to deal with getting the heavy part of a project while everyone else gets light loads. You'll deal with a more extreme example where you do all the work and they do none. There have been many times where I went to the professor and said ""Look, this is my work, this is their work. I've tried to get them in on this, but they aren't having any of it."" Yeah, this makes you feel shitty, but sometimes it's what you have to do to make it out the door with a decent grade.

* **You will feel like you aren't learning anything.** I say this because, up until the last semester or two, I was wandering around campus between classes questioning if I had even learned anything worthwhile. Business Management is fragmented into many different areas, and up until you have a few cornerstone classes that help pull all of your knowledge together and focus it into a single objective, it can sometimes be hard to look back and see how far you've progressed.

* **You won't be able to rely on your degree to get you a job.** You will have to have a solid resume and some work experience. An internship would be really helpful, but I never did one. Be sure to talk more with your professors about job options, and use your colleges career services office to help line up interviews and touch up your resume a good while before you graduate. Don't be like me and just try to wing it after graduation. 


**EDIT:** As some people replying to you have said, if you don't make yourself valuable through job experience or some sort of internship/certifications, you'll pretty much end up in sales. This isn't always a bad thing, but I personally cannot stand the cold-calling and going up to people who put up a hundred barriers once they see that you're trying to sell them something. If you don't want to end up slinging someone else's crappy product, you need to plan to have skills companies are looking for, and once you get your foot in the door, have that BBA in your back pocket to make you a shoe-in for a higher role.


Something I'd HIGHLY suggest is working for a bank. This does wonders for your resume, no matter what industry you decide to go into. I've been to interviews for Helpdesk positions where they pointed it out with surprise and related some mundane job function that I did to the task I was being interviewed for. It shows that you're professional, responsible, and can be trusted handling large amounts of money. You get a glimpse into the financial world, you get to work with accounting documents, you get to help people  get the paperwork together to start their own businesses.. Seriously, working at a bank is a HUGE opportunity for a Business Management major, and you should do everything in your power to snag a job as a teller or something at a local branch.

But hey man, good luck in whatever you intend to do. I hope I've helped a little bit."
"I've been a JVC advocate for a few years now. 

I'm on my 4th pair now and they have on a consistent basis been high quality and long lasting... and comfortable to wear. 

my current set is a JVC HA-RX900. Theyre a little big but theyre immensely comfy, are pretty well soundproofed and the quality is better than anything else I've ever owned. 

£60. my previous JVC pairs came closer to £10-£20 range, but they were pretty nice too... these ones are by far the best ive had though"

"I got a refurbished XR last month and I love it! I upgraded from the 7 plus. I absolutely love the XR, since I don’t need anything special on my phone as long as it lets me check social media lol. 

Plus, it works better with my budget-brand wireless earbuds than my 7 plus did.

If you’re okay with refurbished phones, check out Back Market. I’ve bought all of my Apple products from there and it really makes them more affordable. And they have a 1 year warranty in case anything goes wrong. Legit got a 2013 MacBook Air for $200 last year from there."

"The Open University in the UK is known for long-distance/online learning. I know some nice people who teach there, and people with degrees from there can make it on to do good things. However, I don't think it's 'for profit' like some online courses. If anyone is interested in online learning you should check it out."
"So you got a custom concentration? I’d love to hear how that works out for you! I don’t think I can get that in my country, but I’d consider it if I ever went to the UK."

"> there wasn't enough focus given to the heroes.

Due to having so many characters branching off it also means that some plotlines disappear for a while. Like after Tony and Peter leave earth on the ship they aren't shown for a while so you forget about it. 

The movie also has so much going on that I remember when the rewatch before Endgame happened, a lot of people were surprised (myself included) that Thor arriving at Wakanda was actually before the Titan fight. Not that that really relates to the discussion, but the movie just has so many standout moments from different heroes at different moments at different fights that it lacks the character drama and focus that Endgame."
