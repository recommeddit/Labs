There are quite a few things that are like LoTR, including the Shannara series, but most of them are very predictable and follow a single high fantasy plot type.

As for heavier stuff, I'd recommend the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, or maybe even the Wheel of Time.",best action and adventure novel series

29234,"I'm a PlayStation guy, so I'd have to say a PS3. 

All PS3s play PS1 games. 

Launch model PS3s natively play nearly all PS2 games. 

2nd revision PS3s can natively play most PS2 games. 

3rd revision and later PS3s can't natively play PS2 games but can be modded to emulate many of them.

The PS3 has many wonderful exclusives.

The PS3 is an old school Sony product which means that it's made to be taken apart and easily serviced.

There's a huge homebrew community. The system has been hacked wide open for many years and there are very active communities reverse engineering the system.

Blu Ray discs are a lot tougher than DVDs. They don't scratch easily. However, if a Blu Ray does get scratched, it usually becomes unreadable.

All PS3s have HDMI ports unlike the Xbox 360 and Wii.

All but 1 model of PS3 has WiFi unlike the 360 and Wii

You can easily upgrade the hard drive. It doesn't use proprietary drives like the 360.

The most common fatal flaw of the early PS3s that causes the Yellow Light of Death is often reparable with moderate electronics repair knowledge. The most common problem that causes the 360's Red Ring of Death is repairable but needs professional tools and skills. It's cheaper to just get another Xbox.

While the PS3s disc drive daughterboard is married to the console's motherboard, swapping drives is still easy. You can just change the mechanism and keep the old drive's daughterboard. Also, the Blu Ray lasers are dying, but they're easily replaceable.

If you do need to remarry a drive daughterboard, custom firmware can easily do it.

With custom firmware you can set the fan speed to keep the console cooler than it was when it was new and hopefully prolong its life.

An early PS3 and a PS5 is all you need to play nearly 100% of Playstation titles to date.",best game console

We stayed in the adults only section, which was close to the beach. It is a big resort, which some people don’t like, but it is very easy to get a golf cart to take you anywhere on the grounds. There are a lot of different restaurant and bar options. Right down the beach, off the resort  is the Jellyfish, with freakin amazing food.",best vacation resort
