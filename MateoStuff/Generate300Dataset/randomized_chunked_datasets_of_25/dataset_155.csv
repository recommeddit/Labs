54936,best water filter,"Please re-comment here when you dou!

60538,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Realise you're asking about Netflix but if you're in the UK, Catastrophe on 4od is really excellent. Can't recommend it highly enough!"
17161,best iOS game,"Infinity Blade, Bladeslinger, the good mobile games that died."
55512,best action and adventure novel series,"Some good lighter novels that I liked were the Harry Dresden books, everything by Brent Weeks, and the October Daye series.

There are quite a few things that are like LoTR, including the Shannara series, but most of them are very predictable and follow a single high fantasy plot type.

As for heavier stuff, I'd recommend the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, or maybe even the Wheel of Time."

29234,best game console,"I'm a PlayStation guy, so I'd have to say a PS3. 

All PS3s play PS1 games. 

Launch model PS3s natively play nearly all PS2 games. 

2nd revision PS3s can natively play most PS2 games. 

3rd revision and later PS3s can't natively play PS2 games but can be modded to emulate many of them.

The PS3 has many wonderful exclusives.

The PS3 is an old school Sony product which means that it's made to be taken apart and easily serviced.

There's a huge homebrew community. The system has been hacked wide open for many years and there are very active communities reverse engineering the system.

Blu Ray discs are a lot tougher than DVDs. They don't scratch easily. However, if a Blu Ray does get scratched, it usually becomes unreadable.

All PS3s have HDMI ports unlike the Xbox 360 and Wii.

All but 1 model of PS3 has WiFi unlike the 360 and Wii

You can easily upgrade the hard drive. It doesn't use proprietary drives like the 360.

The most common fatal flaw of the early PS3s that causes the Yellow Light of Death is often reparable with moderate electronics repair knowledge. The most common problem that causes the 360's Red Ring of Death is repairable but needs professional tools and skills. It's cheaper to just get another Xbox.

While the PS3s disc drive daughterboard is married to the console's motherboard, swapping drives is still easy. You can just change the mechanism and keep the old drive's daughterboard. Also, the Blu Ray lasers are dying, but they're easily replaceable.

If you do need to remarry a drive daughterboard, custom firmware can easily do it.

With custom firmware you can set the fan speed to keep the console cooler than it was when it was new and hopefully prolong its life.

An early PS3 and a PS5 is all you need to play nearly 100% of Playstation titles to date."
16389,best sunglasses for fashion,"[Ray-Ban Navigator.](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/ray-ban-59mm-navigator-sunglasses/3298703) It's a squared-off aviator similar to American Optical or Randolph Engineering, but the fit works way better for me. (I previously owned a pair of AOs and they were constantly sliding down my face. These stay put.)"
12378,best gifts for mom,It’s like the off brand toys that look like crappier versions of the real toy. Iron man? How about vaguely red and gold plastic man?
19594,best YouTube video,"Into the crotch, of Indiana Jones"
13582,best research paper archive,"This is such an important thing if you are going into any scientific field of study. I have coworkers who complain constantly about preliminary research and not being able to get the paper they want to read. I always tell them to just email the author, Researchgate is a great tool, and 9/10 times they get a response the same day with the article and a pleasant response from the author who is excited someone took interest in their work. Just send an email! It can’t hurt"
23178,best social networking site for CS,I like my social media to be personal and separate from work
62092,Best RPG game on PS4,Mass effect series is the must of all musts for me. (Not andromeda)
48538,best color to paint with,"Whatever color you end up using, I don't think you should paint the wall or the divide in the middle of the room. I think it would pull the ceiling down and make the room feel smaller. I think that wall needs to stay white or be multiple shades lighter than the wall color."
51,best terminal file manager reddit,I usually love tui apps but I have to agree mostly. Every time I try to use one it’s too much effort to learn when I can just use the shell. I’d add autojump to the list though
33545,best electric car,"That's so good to hear. I have been patiently waiting for someone to crack to code on how to get normal people to buy EVs, and I really hope VW does it with this model. I like that they actually advertise it as well. Every other legacy OEM that has EV's clearly does not actually want to sell them in high volume. Hopefully VW can sell millions and millions worldwide and actually make a dent in the ICE fleet over the next decade."
19574,best YouTube video,They could just not hit any eggs and run past the boss if they wanted. But leeroy needed something from the boss.
34123,best NFL player,"No one quite changed the game of football like LT. Yeah, Rice has the records, Montana has the championships, Favre has the wins. Rice needed Montana, and vice versa. But none of them single-handedly changed the nature of the game quite like Lawrence Taylor."
53942,best medicine for a cold,Salt has not been proven to lessen incidence or symptoms of cold.
32416,best vacation resort,"I really like the Melissa resort I stayed in in Punta Cana. 

[General Website ](https://www.melia.com/en/home.htm) 

[The Level at Melia Caribe](https://www.melia.com/en/hotels/dominican-republic/punta-cana/the-level-at-melia-caribe-tropical/index.htm) 

We stayed in the adults only section, which was close to the beach. It is a big resort, which some people don’t like, but it is very easy to get a golf cart to take you anywhere on the grounds. There are a lot of different restaurant and bar options. Right down the beach, off the resort  is the Jellyfish, with freakin amazing food."
