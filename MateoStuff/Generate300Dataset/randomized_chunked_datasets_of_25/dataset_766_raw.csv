Now dig on this
I agree but lean more towards stand-up bass (double bass).  Whether played with a bow or plucked it's so damned beautiful.

Which reminds me of the other reason that I don't use Manjaro. There's a high proportion of arrogant twats on the subreddit.

It’s weird right? Someone not understanding that there is an industry that actually has a standard and definition that’s enforced all over the USA.

Have you google numpy is it a big insult?"
"My Anker failed on me while hiking the PCT and the company sent me a replacement before they had received the old one. Basically I mailed it to them, sent them a picture of the mailing receipt that day, and they sent me a replacement on the very next day to my next town.
Excellent customer service. The replacement Anker never had issues."
"""Could you put the Pimm's cup in a...""

""Right on it sir!"""

"it’s not, in my northeastern state."
"My parents weren’t rich enough to buy me anything, but i didn’t complaint. I waited until i could buy with my own money. Thanks :)"
"This time of year I get a bowl of yogurt, cut up a nectarine, crush some walnuts and a piece of rye crisp bread, add flax seeds and cereal until the bowl is full. In the winter I'll have oatmeal and applesauce.

I compliment this with either a peanut butter sandwich, a cheese and marmalade sandwich or crisp bread with cheese and cucumber slices. Always coffee and grapefruit juice.

I don't generally have the patience for cooking for breakfast but on the weekends I might make an omelet with bell peppers, onions, whole cumin and a bit of cheese."
More fun than a pillow fight!
"It depends what you're looking for. I personally like more adventurous and unique experiences that cruises, but many people love them. A decent portion of people enjoy relaxing vacations like a resort."
"Wait, isn’t this the one that tastes like sink water?"
"Hahah yep no hate on anywhere else though I'm pretty sure I've made it clear of what my taste is a few mentions for outside of New York
Dre- The chronic
Snoop- Doggystyle 
Geto boys- We Can't Be Stopped
Saafir- Boxcar Sessions"
"You should calibrate it, the color accuracy and uniformity on it is pretty good actually. And yeah I also miss the little joystick on the LG."
Vladimir?
I very much enjoyed Superstore!
"I used to wear Paris Hilton 10 years ago and you're right...so many compliments! I had totally forgotten about it, I'll have to pick up a bottle and give it another go."
Not sure why? May I suggest... Little Caesars on Milpas?
"Make sure to poke a small hole in the egg, or you'll have egg on the walls of your microwave."
"Depends on the project. 

If it’s a big project I usually go with Axios but when I need something lightweight I will use Ky.

Indeed I do. I am *definitely* not as hard-core in stats as I'd like to be.
1. Kourtney 2. Kim 3. Kylie tie for last place: Khloe and Kendall. Kourtney has always been one of my favorites but Kim and Khloe have switched places for me in the last few years.
"Based on your game selection, sounds like you will need to make a decision. The last of us is on ps3/ps4, while mario kart is on nintendo systems. If you are looking for a more story/narrative driven experience, the last of us on ps3/4 is what you want, whereas if you want just something quick and possibly on the go, a switch may suit you better.

That being said, Nintendo is usually pretty user friendly, where ps3/4 is less so. (Its still easy to get into, I just find nintendo titles tend to hold your hand more as they are usually designed for kids)"
