3462,best college for research,"Hmm, I always thought of Brown as a T10, but I don't think it really matters. If someone picking between Columbia Penn and Brown wants to use rankings to pick, their loss lol"
33647,best electric car,"Big issue for me is either getting into work butts early to grab one of the chargers there, or having to go a few miles out of the way of my commute to hit up a charging station for however long that takes. With my gas car I can stop at one of the many options right along the way either going in or going home."
10462,best suitcase lock,"Or, I have one better for you.

Let's say you are traveling with some expensive camera equipment, and you want to pack that - but you also want to have other expensive items in your carry on.

Go to Walmart and buy a $40 starter pistol. Then put the pistol in the bag with your camera equipment. When you arrive at the airport, tell them that you have a firearm to declare. Here's the best part. You don't have to have any type of license for a starter pistol, but it must be checked as a firearm. They will give you a form to fill out, then that bag must be taken directly to the aircraft and locked up with the pilot."
7516,best laptop for general use,"less than $4k??? US? lol.  seriously, for what you want to do, get a macbook  pro 16. Or wait for the M2 next year.

Otherwise, If I had a choice, of any machine, I would get this:

31424,best country to live in,musste erstmal google was das heisst aber ja ist richtig :D
4658,best text editor,"Atom has been aquired by Microsoft, so it's out.

 The two options I see that may fit are Geany (really lightweight in comparaison to vscode), or VSCodium"
57684,best cologne,"To add to this, fragrance is typically the term that should be used instead."
41507,best instrument to play,"You could learn either guitar or piano. As a low intermediate guitarist, I can confirm that it is hard, especially at first, but it is a very fun instrument to play. It has some advantages over the piano. For one, you have more options for very different sounding chord voicings. It is also easier to change keys, and you can do more techniques (electric guitar, clasical guitar, and acoustic guitar all have different techniques, although some techniques are shared by all kinds of guitars.) There are more lessons available for guitar, and it is more versatile. However, it also has its cons. On guitar, it will take you at least a couple weeks in order to get a decent sounding chord, and your fingers will hurt. a lot. On guitar, chord shapes and scales are harder to learn. The piano, on the other hand, has a wider range of notes (about twice the range of the average guitar.) Another pro of learning piano is that learning your chords and scales are a lot easier since they're all laid out in front of you. I'll say it is easier to learn the piano to a point of proficiency, but guitar is more versatile, and portable"
23542,best car racing video game,"I like it because there's multiple levels of progression as well.  


First couple races? Keep ABS on and traction control high. Starting to get that under your belt? Turn off ABS and turn TCS down, turn simulation damage on.  


Starting to get the hang of that? Turn on manual transmission. All the while, if you're finishing far ahead of where you want to be, you can turn the AI racers up or down. All the youtubers play with AI at 110%. I've been gradually turning the AI up and I'm at the point where if I'm racing absolutely perfectly I can just about stay close to Mercedes.  


Make some money and get some upgrades in your car, or save up some cash and buy a better power unit for the next season.  


You can also go as deep as you want tuning for individual tracks and stuff - so you can set it up for either ""I just wanna zone out and have a tough race that I can definitely win"" or ""I really want the feeling of being in the middle of the pack fighting for points."""
71927,best movies with a cool twist,Arlington Road. Very rare a movie ends like that.
18372,best YouTube video,“That was fuckin’ sharecroppin’ if I ever seen it.”
64608,Best Nike running shoes,Thats a very interesting comparison. I think i’d agree with this.
69751,best major to study in college,"Any major starting with ""Pre-"". Pre-law, pre-med, etc.

I know several people who became doctors with degrees in chemistry, biology, or engineering. I also know someone who finished pre-med, went to med school, realized he didn't want to be a doctor, and was fucked. He ended up spending 4 years getting a second bachelor's degree.

Likewise, you can easily get a law degree and become a lawyer with degrees in all sorts of things. You can't do anything else with a pre-law degree."
49146,best gaming monitor,Samsung 1440 super ultra wide ;)
29145,best calendar tool,"Thanks guys. We do both have Google accounts, I'll check it out."
33536,best electric car,"Right...?

And in saying the Mustang is the first competitor the general public will buy."
42449,movies like Inception,Not sure if Sucker Punch should be compared to good movies in general.
68615,best science fiction novel,"Same here, I've read them in Polish. Translations are not that bad, but as you probably know, Polish is more expressive than English. It loses much of its original diversity after translating."
57445,best water brand,"There's a great Michael McIntyre skit on this.

&#x200B;

Pump can go to hell, by the way."
23125,best celebrity,"I used to work event security so I've met quite a few. Played nerf football with n'sync and had JT play a bit of a prank on me. The beastie boys brought out all the food from thier dressing room post show and hand delivered it to the folks working backstage. Robert paige was not to be spoken to. 

Probably the nicest though was Jr Seau. I worked the payers parking lot, he was always the first player in. Brought us doughnuts and coffee from his favorite spot (depending on the game we were there at 5:30am sometimes) always chatted as long as it wasn't about the game. He also owned a sports bar in town. years later after I stopped working security me and some friends were there and he happens to be there as well. Loaded my table comped multiple apps, sent over a few entrees, and then on his way out stopped by had a good chat with me gave me a few cigars he still had in the back. Crazy that he remembered me like 6 years after I stopped working games."
33087,best energy drink,"No: Way too much sugar or whatever fake shit they put in there. However, given the choice of a nap or a stimulant, I'd take a cup of coffee with soymilk and no added sugar. Naps don't work well for me. Damn you, sleep paralysis."
68720,best science fiction novel,"Idk if others would agree, but a personal favorite of mine is the [Alex Benedict series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/42152-alex-benedict).

It's about an antiques dealer 10,000 years in the future (really more like a tomb raider), who hunts for famous lost spacecraft/tech. Basically a series of detective novels in an interstellar setting.

Each one is its own story, but they do reference each other so probably best to start with A Talent for War. I started with Polaris though, and was fine."
