Let's say you are traveling with some expensive camera equipment, and you want to pack that - but you also want to have other expensive items in your carry on.

Go to Walmart and buy a $40 starter pistol. Then put the pistol in the bag with your camera equipment. When you arrive at the airport, tell them that you have a firearm to declare. Here's the best part. You don't have to have any type of license for a starter pistol, but it must be checked as a firearm. They will give you a form to fill out, then that bag must be taken directly to the aircraft and locked up with the pilot.",best suitcase lock

41507,"You could learn either guitar or piano. As a low intermediate guitarist, I can confirm that it is hard, especially at first, but it is a very fun instrument to play. It has some advantages over the piano. For one, you have more options for very different sounding chord voicings. It is also easier to change keys, and you can do more techniques (electric guitar, clasical guitar, and acoustic guitar all have different techniques, although some techniques are shared by all kinds of guitars.) There are more lessons available for guitar, and it is more versatile. However, it also has its cons. On guitar, it will take you at least a couple weeks in order to get a decent sounding chord, and your fingers will hurt. a lot. On guitar, chord shapes and scales are harder to learn. The piano, on the other hand, has a wider range of notes (about twice the range of the average guitar.) Another pro of learning piano is that learning your chords and scales are a lot easier since they're all laid out in front of you. I'll say it is easier to learn the piano to a point of proficiency, but guitar is more versatile, and portable",best instrument to play
23542,"I like it because there's multiple levels of progression as well.  


First couple races? Keep ABS on and traction control high. Starting to get that under your belt? Turn off ABS and turn TCS down, turn simulation damage on.  


Starting to get the hang of that? Turn on manual transmission. All the while, if you're finishing far ahead of where you want to be, you can turn the AI racers up or down. All the youtubers play with AI at 110%. I've been gradually turning the AI up and I'm at the point where if I'm racing absolutely perfectly I can just about stay close to Mercedes.  


Make some money and get some upgrades in your car, or save up some cash and buy a better power unit for the next season.  


You can also go as deep as you want tuning for individual tracks and stuff - so you can set it up for either ""I just wanna zone out and have a tough race that I can definitely win"" or ""I really want the feeling of being in the middle of the pack fighting for points.""",best car racing video game

I know several people who became doctors with degrees in chemistry, biology, or engineering. I also know someone who finished pre-med, went to med school, realized he didn't want to be a doctor, and was fucked. He ended up spending 4 years getting a second bachelor's degree.

The beastie boys brought out all the food from thier dressing room post show and hand delivered it to the folks working backstage. Robert paige was not to be spoken to. 

Probably the nicest though was Jr Seau. I worked the payers parking lot, he was always the first player in. Brought us doughnuts and coffee from his favorite spot (depending on the game we were there at 5:30am sometimes) always chatted as long as it wasn't about the game. He also owned a sports bar in town. years later after I stopped working security me and some friends were there and he happens to be there as well. Loaded my table comped multiple apps, sent over a few entrees, and then on his way out stopped by had a good chat with me gave me a few cigars he still had in the back. Crazy that he remembered me like 6 years after I stopped working games.",best celebrity

It's about an antiques dealer 10,000 years in the future (really more like a tomb raider), who hunts for famous lost spacecraft/tech. Basically a series of detective novels in an interstellar setting.

Each one is its own story, but they do reference each other so probably best to start with A Talent for War. I started with Polaris though, and was fine.",best science fiction novel
