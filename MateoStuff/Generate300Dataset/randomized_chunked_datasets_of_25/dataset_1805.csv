9026,"1. Let a and b be equal non-zero quantities

    a = b \,

2. Multiply through by a

    a^2 = ab \,

3. Subtract b^2 \,

    a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2 \,

4. Factor both sides

    (a - b)(a + b) = b(a - b) \,

5. Divide out (a - b) \,

    a + b = b \,

6. Observing that a = b \,

    b + b = b \,

7. Combine like terms on the left

    2b = b \,

8. Divide by the non-zero b

    2 = 1 \,

I remember buying this shit the night it came out and just laying there, listening. It was a spectacle in a way that I had never really heard in a rap album before and it was fascinating to me. It had an ambition and passion that you could feel and to this day I still maintain that the storytelling on the album, ignoring production, is rock-operaesque. It's like his Quadrophenia.",best rap album
26084,"No politician is without some opponents. 

In American politics, the only ""politician"" that was widely respected while he was president was Washington. Hell, we would have let him be king but he didn't want glory. (At least that is what we are taught although, I have never read/heard anything to go against this)

Other than him, all our widely ""respected"" politicians have seemed to earn that title after they are dead. 

ex. Lincoln, sure he had supporters but also a lot of detractors. Now he is seen as the second best president we have had (after Washington) and is widely seen as a respectable figure. 

-------

I think there is too much passion involved in politics. It takes a historical perspective to really recognize the people who where honest and respectable. 

For example, I don't agree with most of what Ron Paul says, but I respect him. I think history will portray him as an honest politician who had well thought out ideas and didn't back down on his beliefs.
