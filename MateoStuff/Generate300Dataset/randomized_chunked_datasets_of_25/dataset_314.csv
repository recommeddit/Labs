32585,best vacation resort,"My wife and i aren't really into all inclusive resorts. We just got back from our second trip to St. Martin, French side, and had a great time like we did the first time.  It was May, so it was the end of the busy season, got rooms for cheap, had the beach nearly to ourselves, all the places were open, beautiful weather, ate every night in a different gourmet French restaurant or local place within a 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Both vacations were fantastic and quite affordable."

46422,best trick or treating candy,"We live in a middle class neighborhood, so we would get the random assortment of things.

But we lived near a rich gated neighborhood. It was closed off during Halloweeen, but my friends knew a storm tunnel to go through.

Boy was it worth it.

After several houses we came back with a quarter pillow case full of soda cans and full sized candy bars. Even the people who didn't have the big stuff just gave us handfuls of candy.

The next year they put a metal grate on the drain."
