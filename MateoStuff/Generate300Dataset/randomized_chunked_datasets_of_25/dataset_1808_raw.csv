"Not for the next 8 years. But after that, you have a shot."
"I think the oil is needed in general to make a chocolate fountain run smoothly, but rest of that is gross lol."
"IMHO, the best game is PMD: Explorers of Sky, though that's not a main series game. As far as main series games go, they're all fairly good. As others have said, Bw->B2W2 had some of the best story. I did not like Hoenn at all, personally, so I'd recommend staying away from RSE or ORAS."
very awsome man
"I hated this book right up until I loved it. I had seen so many people squeeing about it online and I just wasn't impressed. At some point though I realized I was enjoying it. I think if you liked the movie Butter (with Jennifer Garner, was I the only one who saw that?) or Election with Reese Witherspoon, you'd probably like this book as well. It had the same vibe, imo."

I'm unable to give an opinion on XII Zodiac Age yet. I've only played the PS2 version years ago.

"Yes, a rabbit!

Our rabbit lives in our house, in a cage. He was raised very carefully as a baby (before we got him) to be used to and comfortable around humans. 

He has a toilet, that he actually uses, that we just clean out daily. No smells. He loves to be petted and attention and to be social. Other then that, he's very low maintenance. We usually have his cage open, but he doesn't get out. He just puts his head out to ask for cuddles. 

We have cats too. Cats are assholes. They destroy our house, are loud and leave hair everywhere. Plus they poop in our garden if they get the chance (yes they each have a perfectly fine and clean litter box inside the house). The rabbit is 100 times better at being a good pet. 

If you do decide on a rabbit, get one from a responsible breader that gives plenty of human contact when they're babies."
"The March series (as I call it) **ends** with We Few ;-) and I love it, thoroughly enjoying my reread a few months ago. I have been known to swear with the word, ""pocking"". (It wasn't on the list because I copied and pasted from a space opera post.)

I have followed SRG since Deathstalker came out, liking Nightside and liking Drood even more but Ishmael Jones and Ghostfinders did nothing for me.

I assume you have read the Belisarius series by David Drake and Eric Flint, which is precisely as good as the March series, even if it hasn't got the space age weapons.

On a slightly lower level of quality to March and Belisarius is the General series by David Drake and SM Stirling.

There is the Sparta series by Niven and Pournelle which I enjoyed reading 3 times but unfortunately didn't enjoy the fourth attempt.

You will probably enjoy Julian May's Rampart Worlds series.

I hope you have read the new Vorkosigan novella, the Flowers of Vashnoi that came out 3 weeks ago. I enjoyed it.

You can look at my [goodreads shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41606738-seantheaussie) if you like to see what I like in other genres. 5 stars is reread list. 4 stars is good. 3 stars is read. 2 stars is DNF due to boredom. 1 star is DNF due to dislike.

I am going to bookmark you and will send you a message if I come across any more books that meet our mutual tastes. Please do the same."
"It's also got F1 2020, Dirt 4, Dirt 5, Dirt Rally 2, MotoGP 20; you'll definitely get your fix of racing sims on Xbox for that $1 entry fee.

On Switch, the closest I've found in terms of the actual racing is Grid, but that lacks all the other aspects of GT/Forza; collecting cars, tuning, etc."
Holy fuck its not the 17th?! My brother is an asshole
"Yeah, not cheap, but well designed. Here is the mini version for [$290](http://www.amazon.com/Tolomeo-micro-table-lamp-Artemide/dp/B001CN8EIY/ref=pd_rhf_ee_p_t_1) on Amazon."
"Brady having 7 is just stupid. Manning was as good or better than most of the QBs we have discussed in this thread and he had to be carried to his 2nd just to join the multiple SB club. So many all time greats have two or fewer. Their careers weren’t/aren’t “wasted,” it’s just really hard to win one, let alone multiple."
"Hygienist—The biggest benefit of toothpaste is fluoride and fresh breath. As long as it has the ADA seal of approval, it has the proper amount of fluoride.  If you have sensitivity. Get a formula that contains potassium nitrate (should be listed with fluoride as an active ingredient on the back of the box).
Otherwise, use a TP that you like the flavor of.  If you force yourself to  use one that you hate, you won’t brush long enough.  
Invest in a good electric toothbrush—one that plugs into an outlet and sits on a charger (NOT a cheapy battery one). Oral-B and Sonicare are good quality choices.
Obviously, floss once daily and consider using  “Soft Picks” for wider spaces"
