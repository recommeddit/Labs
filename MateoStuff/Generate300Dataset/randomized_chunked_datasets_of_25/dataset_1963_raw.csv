I asked the bartender the other night if they could get glengoolie blue. He just smiled and said no that he's already looked for it and it's not real.

"Waugh lost to a very very determined India in 2001, and it took a few freak performances. Also, Windies domination ended in 95 but it doesnt mean Australias domination started then, they lost the 96 WC and almost didnt make it to the 99 WC Final."
"Thanks for this!! 

Can I push the love and ask for a basic difference between antihistamines and anti-inflammatory meds? My husband is allergic to Voltaren and thinks that my antihistamines are the same medication and he'll be allergic to them too. He gets allergic rashes/hives sometimes and I think the my meds might help but he refuses to consider it. Obviously he should consult his doc but that will be at least 3 steps away. If I can explain the basic difference it will be a starting point."

"I have a bachelor's from University of Phoenix.  I think it all depends on the field you are going in to.  For me, the degree made my resume look good enough to get an interview so I could prove that I was a good fit for the company.  I was hired as a systems administrator by a company I love.  The only problem with my education is that I am now under a mountain of debt."
"Let's just say there is a ton of far better alternatives, which might consume a little more time to learn, but surely it's time well invested. PHP is *ok* for blogs and shit, not for any *real* development."
"Building off of your point, I often see Penn being described as more prestigious than Brown (and Dartmouth, for that matter). Thatâ€™s probably true in some circles, but Iâ€™ve always thought differently. 

Brown and Dartmouth are more like liberal arts colleges than they are graduate-level research universities, given their relative sparseness of grad programs and avowed focus on undergrads. This sinks their rankings but shouldnâ€™t diminish their institutional reputations. As an undergrad there, both in allocation of resources and position in the social/cultural fabric of the university, youâ€™re the protagonist. Thatâ€™s a pretty great position to be in at an Ivy League school.

Meanwhile, Penn is basically a tad-less-prestigious cast of the same mold as Harvard, Columbia, and Stanford (to some extent): undergrad is just one school among a sea of grad programs. Unless youâ€™re at Wharton, thereâ€™s no caveat like for Dartmouth and Brown: itâ€™s just not quite as prestigious as some of its peer research universities. Moreover, Pennâ€™s overall reputation is inflated by Wharton (as others in this thread have suggested), and its acceptance rate is deflated by the same (though itâ€™s still less selective in aggregate than Brown)."
"Kim:


she is my favorite. I like how calm she can be, how disciplined she is, her support for her husband, and her ambitions, especially when it comes to helping people


I think that her constant striving to look flawless and all the selfies seem a little insecure at times. She doesn't need all that in my opinion.


Khloe:


Her honesty, her discipline, her positivity, her passion


Honestly, I think she might be trying a little too hard to look pretty which makes her look a little unnatural at times. She is pretty without all that.


Kourtney:


Her passion for a healthy life, how she always wants to spend time with her kids, how calm she appears, her sense of humor


I feel that she often builds walls around her emotionally and doesn't try to understand other people's perspectices


Kendall:


her attitude to be down for whatever


I don't really pay enough attention to her to know what I would dislike about her


Kylie:


How much she loves being a mom and how she cherished her pregnancy that she just wanted it to be special privately instead of seeking attention


This is not so much her doing but Forbes saying she is a self made billionaire. Good for her that she is successful but 1) she already had the attention and fanbase and 2) her family's money and 3) it's lipstick. It's not like she had a super unique idea. Again, great that she is successful and passionate about it but there are people out there that came from.nothing that get little or no recognition"

Are you thinking of sodium fluoride (NaF)?
I heard it's super boring though.
"anyone else? Gharissa Icecreamâ€™s? Got to try them only recently, found it to be thick, rich & true to itâ€™s flavor. 

and, yes, HaÃ¤gen-Dasz over Baskin Robbins.

If we talking Baskin Robbins, honestly, just go for any icecream in the â€˜shadesâ€™ of brown and get a good pump of those hot butterscotch sauce, some nuts and the cherries that taste similar toðŸª³. The butterscotch is the main element, atleast to me."

"I overused my PS4, and was irresponsible with rest mode. I ended up melting it a little inside, and had to get it repaired. The fan now goes as fast as it can whenever I play games, so when I got my gaming computer, I stuck to it because of the convenient silence. Also, my computer's specs dwarf that of my PS4, and I didn't have to pay a lot in comparison to most other gaming computers. I bought it from my aunt for $800."
"It's not my favorite, but it's a regular at my house. We mix oats, chia seeds, blueberries, dried/unsweetened coconut, milk (or non-dairy alternative and let it sit overnight. In the morning, heat it up with a tablespoon of honey. It's filling, healthy and not boring at all, every day."
The ones you linked to are usb-a to usb-c. It's an obsolete cable.  The OP was asking for for the regular C2C ones.
This comment always follows the real LPT.

Bonus points if you can match up your outfits to one of the original ones!
"It depends on what you want to develop. Frontend developer must know HTML/CSS/Javascript to some extent but if you focus on backend, you can simply use any frontend framework (bootstrap, foundation) without actual learning all that stuff: CSS alone can be pretty complex and Javascript is not easy as well (though using some solutions for trivial tasks is easy). I'd say that you should try to make whatever you want and you will see what you need to learn. Python is fine for backend, you can switch to other language/framework if it will be better for your task but Python frameworks aren't bad.

Find yourself a task, pick any framework on any language and just start coding/googling. You'll be fine."
YES. I get sinus pressure headaches from weather changes and use them to help with that too! They do work really well.
