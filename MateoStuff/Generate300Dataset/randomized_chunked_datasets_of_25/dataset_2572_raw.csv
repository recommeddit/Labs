"No, an example would be an MS ECE or CS. Good way to get into a chip design or software role and work 40hr weeks."
"Yea that's the problem with these comparisons. For the 1948 Aussies, England were the only decent opposition. For the Saffers, while there were 3 other very good teams (Aus, Eng, WI) around - plus 2 emerging forces in India and Pak - they never got the chance to display their fearsome potential.

One of cricket's biggest what-ifs is how SA would have fared Vs WI in the late 70s. But I can't imagine a team with Pollock, Richards, Barlow, Procter, van der Bijl (with Rice to follow) wouldn't have held its own."

">you have to carefully cut and portion an entire pie: thats complicated.

Not really.  Eyeballing it is just fine.  If portions are off a bit, it’ll still average out in the end.

And if you’re *really* anal about counting calories/macros you’d weigh the portions, which you’d have to do with muffins as well.

Anyway, just offering an alternative opinion.  By all means go for the muffins if that’s what you like."

"I know, I know. But the [ridiculousness is half the fun.](https://i.imgur.com/alPpAwX.png) : )

That, and people getting slightly annoyed how much better I look in meetings. lol

And *then* their faces when they ask what webcam I'm using and I show them that list. Pure bliss.

I just thoroughly enjoy doing the excessive opposite of what everybody else is doing.

Everybody is rocking shitty laptop webcams, barely above the GameBoy Camera? Of course I'm building an almost $4000 webcam you could shoot a movie on. Duh!

Everybody is wearing these tiny white apple earpods that look like you've got lollipop sticks stuck in your ear? You can bet your behind that I'm wearing [the most chunky, black, industrial looking headphones I can get my hands on](https://i.imgur.com/VdDaJF9.png) (Sennheiser RS 185, highly recommended wireless headphones!), just to see if someone reacts, and boy do they.

Anyway. That's my way of making these insufferable meetings a little bit more fun.

> You'd get identical quality out of a $500 used Tamron lens

Yeah, this is by no means a buying guide, this is just me being extravagant. ; )

If we're being reasonable, any shitty $300 point n shoot with HDMI-out would give you a complete package that could beat those laptop webcams without breaking a sweat. I just wanted to setup the most excessive webcam that I could with the parts that I already got.

I also tried a [Voigtländer Nokton 40mm 1.2](https://geizhals.eu/voigtlaender-nokton-40mm-1-2-for-sony-e-black-19665-a1705684.html), beautiful portrait lens with absurd DOF, but unfortunately my desk isn't deep enough for that focal length. I can barely get my face in frame but with a lens like that you really need some good amount of background to truly appreciate the bokeh rendering."
"Haha you’re remarkably close!! I do love vintage stuff and I think that is definitely reflected in my taste in fragrance!! I also am a huge fan of 18th and 19th century lit, so you’re spot on there! Bravo!!"

"Edit: My post assumes that you don't enjoy reading and/or are procrastinating about it. 

The problem with procrastination is that thinking about achieving a product has a much higher pain response than completing a process. So reading X hours is probably much easier to think about than reading X pages as the latter is a product and not a process.

Regulatory Failure."" Psychological Bulletin 133, no. 1 (Jan 2007): 65‐94.

Here's some more information.

>Process means, the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that
flow of time. As in, I'm going to spend 20 minutes
working. Product is an outcome, for example, a homework assignment that you need to
finish.

>The product is what triggers the pain that
causes you to procrastinate. Instead, you need to focus on the process
or processes. The small chunks of time you need over
days or even weeks to answer the questions or
prepare for tests. Who cares whether you finish the homework
or grasp the key concepts in any one session. The whole point instead, is that you
calmly put forth your best effort for a short
period."

"My list of preference for stores.  

1.  Harbor Freight for disposables, one-off items, most hand tools unless I'm going HIGH end.  (Their stuff is about Stanley grade, sometimes better.  But it's substantially below pro level). 

2. Menards except for plumbing.  

3. Ace for Hardware (and strangely they have the best Christmas lights, even better than Target).

4. An actual lumber yard for any furniture grade lumber.

5. An actual plumber's supply store for plumbing.

6. Amazon.com (nice tools, some hard to find items)

7. Home Depot or Lowes, whichever actually has the items I need. Like, strangely, Home Depot HQ refuses to stock rounded baseboard molding caps, even though every house in the region is made with rounded corners (adobe looking style southwestern houses).  Even the Home Depot staff are upset about that...

For appliances, you should try and wait until September when they're 40-50% off.  Appliances have an insane markup (about 70%) and are built like garbage these days (last about 7 years)."
"Is this any good? I only bought my Series S literally for Forza Motorsport/ Horizon and the State of Decay games (PS5 is my main console)... but got Game Pass for £1 so I’m looking to try some of the Game Pass games. 

I mean it’s free so I may as well try it, but if it’s a steaming pile of shite then I’ll not bother to even download it. Does it work okay on game pad? I know it’s predominantly a PC game so."
Moto G power or similar phone is an even better weight to powered ratio to add to your consideration. Overlooked in my opinion.
"Responsive dev, no ads, no requests for $$ support, big community, not P2W. A bit of a grind but some people really enjoy grinding for something. It may just be that it’s not for everyone but I can’t think of another game where I’ve felt impelled to donate to support rather than paying to remain relevant."
Thanks! Did you notice any picture clarity difference after putting it on? And how much friction would you say it produces compared to paper?
Incredible games.

This is a great list I second this.
"If u would like to try something different, a mix of sidescroling hack n slash/Jrpg/tactical game, Odin Sphere. Amazing little gem."
"I'm so glad this list list was compiled, thank you for the hard work!! Unfortunately it looks like I have tastes a little different than most. There are a few books I totally agree it being there but many just not my cup of tea, even in the genres I typically read.

I'm happy to see Courtney Milan and Sherry Thomas and Elle Kennedy. Evie Dunmore and Sally Thorne too. I don't get the love for Tessa Dare or Helen Hoang. Not judging of course just find it interesting to observe what's popular and how tastes can differ so much."
thanks I abandoned it in the end (assuming it wasn't posted) it kept saying there was a problem and hadn't seemed to post....
