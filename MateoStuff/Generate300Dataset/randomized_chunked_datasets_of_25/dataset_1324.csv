2. Aria - Provided me with almost two months of good night sleeps

3. Gurren Lagann - Did raw hype before Symphogear was cool

4. Monogatari Series - It goes for mystery, drama, romance, ecchi, comedy, meta, supernatural, and coming of age. And it does all of them well

5. Mob Psycho 100 - Refreshingly off-beat comedy and a surprisingly endearing art style with a nice thematic backbone tying it all together",best anime

However, the next sentence, ""Length of stay in hospital and duration of fever were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively)"" tells you that the length of stay and fever duration were significantly shorter, with 1% and 4% chances of error respectively.",best research paper archive

31623,"Every time I traveled abroad, I stayed in AirBnBs or tiny places with a ton of character.  It never cost that much, and it's much more worth it to us to have a cool place than a ton of luxuries.  Our favorite, so far, has been [Tashitakge in Lhasa](https://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/lhasa-babao.html).

I do travel a fair bit around the US for work, and as a solo-traveler, and I get comped a lot of suites (I guess they know as a single traveler, they know I won't ever pay for it, while a family of four might spring for it?).  By far, my favorite hotel in the US is the Adolphus in Dallas.  Ton of character, amazing bar, great gym, even the regular rooms are huge, has a great coffee shop and barbershop attached, it's right in the middle of the city.  It kind of makes other US hotels, even 4-5 star ones, seem kind of dingy.",best hotel to live in

16581,"So, I'm in the same boat (except I already have 2 dogs).

I picked up a 55 gal tank with a load of reptile stuff on the cheap.  Picked up a few other things, got the tank temps stable for a Bearded Dragon, and was ready to bring my 3.5 year old to pick out her new pet.  She's been asking about her dragon for about 2 weeks at this point, and honestly, I've always wanted a beardy too.

At the store with my wife, 3.5 year old and 9 month old.  Wife stumbles across a sign that says reptiles are NOT recommended for households with kids under 5 due to salmonella risks.  Instantly shut the whole thing down, understandably.  I didn't even think about salmonella risks, mostly because I know about proper hygein and cleaning for reptile pets (had turtles once upon a time).  So, now I have this 55 gal tank and stand.  Lights, accessories, whole nine yards.  Nothing to put in it.  Rodents are a no go, reptiles are a no go, and fish are a no go.  I've been thinking about what to put in this tank.

I stumbled across the idea of Hermit Crabs.  They carry no human-communicable diseases.  Extremely social and do well in groups.  Colorful shells.  Like to climb.  Fairly easy upkeep from what I've read.

Might be a good idea?  Not really something you pet, but you can hold em in your hand I suppose.  Anybody of experience with these lil guys?",best pet for toddlers
