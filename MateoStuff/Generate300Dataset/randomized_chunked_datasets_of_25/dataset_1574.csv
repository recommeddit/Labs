65069,"Ha! Bibi Ji - hopefully they have their shit together and fired the rude bitch waitress. Went their twice based on friends' recommendation when they first opened. First time we went the RB at the door would not take a reservation and became very rude/condescending to the woman in our group that was trying to make the reservation (oh, that's right, that's their culture /sar). She ended up also being our very rude waitress. 

Second time we went she again was our waitress who became rude when we asked about items on the menu. She got our order wrong, did not deliver all of the food we had ordered but was included on our bill - oh yeah, and charged us for two rounds of drinks when we only received one round. When we pointed that out instead of taking the second round off the bill, the second round suddenly arrives as we are trying to leave!!! At one point we actually started talking about just walking out, then the owner stopped by the table and apologized. Fuck this place if that rude bitch still works there. 

The food is pretty good so it's too bad that they have someone working there that is so rude we will never consider going there again.",best places to eat in Santa Barbara
