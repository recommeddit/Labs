59120,best perfume,My piano teacher would get strong migraines from perfumes and body sprays - always good to check if the people around you can handle it :)
72537,best keyboard switches,"While not my personal favorite switch, if you're going for mostly gaming you should invest into Red switches.

* They're on the quiet side of mechanical switches, so lots of key presses and spamming keys won't be as loud and clacky as others (which isn't much of a problem if you live alone, but with others such as SO or roommates it can be fairly annoying for them)

* they're a softer switch, so it requires less pressure to register a key press, which means overall less stress on your fingers over longer sessions.

* there's also a long enough distance between where the switch registers and where it bottoms out, which is ideal for ""double tapping"", which allows you to quickly press the keys multiple time with each one registering without having to wait for the key to return.

Personally i prefer brown switches myself, but that's because i spend nearly as much time actually typing as i do gaming, and browns offer a nice mix of quiet and comfort while still having a relatively high actuation force that makes long typing sessions feel way less strenuous."
18138,best Kardashian,I know someone in the criminal justice area who met Kim and said she was super nice and very engaged and eager to learn and focused on the cause. Also much shorter than they had imagined.

60990,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Scrotal Recall, Mixology,  and IT Crowd."
25304,best spiderman actor,Tobey wasn’t even a bad Spider-Man. He was a good Spider-Man. It’s just cause he doesn’t quip as much in comparison to the other two.
25868,best cricket teams of all time,"Mate, I was of course joking"
66257,best soccer team in the world,Do you think if we won the other night the vote would have been different? I wonder how much that would have changed the general public perception.
32550,best vacation resort,It's more of a lazy river that goes right past your room but yes you can swim to within a few feet of your patio from all over the resort

55152,best places to hike in the east coast,"Its tough to just walk through the woods on the east coast, mainly because of all the undergrowth. I was surprised when I went to lake Tahoe that you can just walk up into the woods relatively easily."
8540,best toothpaste,"I asked my mom (a dentist) and this was her reply...

""I use two products only available at dental office.  OTC. Crest pro-health or sedadyne's new product that hardens enamel is good.""

There ya go...

Edit...forgive her typing skills...she constantly misspells stuff while texting.  She has all of us using Clinpro-5000 and a sonicare toothbrush."
65695,best phone service company,"Definitely always got better speeds on TMo where I had service but not a single spot I can think of where TMo had a signal and Verizon didn’t after being all over FL with both.  TMo constantly had indoor areas with no signal, especially in south florida.  I never tried B71 though maybe it helped a lot down there.

I have hit congestion problems more and even some down towers with VZ though."
73170,best Linux distro,Fortunately you can use cinnamon in Ubuntu or derivatives
19133,best YouTube video,"If you enjoy relatively long essay videos about film, Lindsay Ellis and Breadsword. 

The latter doesn't have so many videos out, they don't upload too often, but the ones they have are very good. Not the most commanding voice, but they clearly are very passionate about the subject matter, I particularly recommend their videos on Treasure Planet and, Dr Strangelove.

Lindsay Ellis did a whole series of videos on queer film theory among other subjects, using the Michael Bay Transformers films as the study, as well as a very good three part series on The Hobbit trilogy, a dissection of GoT season 8 and (assuming it hasn't been taken down, not sure) a funny examination of 'Dadaist masterpiece' Freddie Got Fingered."
