72537,"While not my personal favorite switch, if you're going for mostly gaming you should invest into Red switches.

* They're on the quiet side of mechanical switches, so lots of key presses and spamming keys won't be as loud and clacky as others (which isn't much of a problem if you live alone, but with others such as SO or roommates it can be fairly annoying for them)

* they're a softer switch, so it requires less pressure to register a key press, which means overall less stress on your fingers over longer sessions.

* there's also a long enough distance between where the switch registers and where it bottoms out, which is ideal for ""double tapping"", which allows you to quickly press the keys multiple time with each one registering without having to wait for the key to return.

Personally i prefer brown switches myself, but that's because i spend nearly as much time actually typing as i do gaming, and browns offer a nice mix of quiet and comfort while still having a relatively high actuation force that makes long typing sessions feel way less strenuous.",best keyboard switches

19133,"If you enjoy relatively long essay videos about film, Lindsay Ellis and Breadsword. 

The latter doesn't have so many videos out, they don't upload too often, but the ones they have are very good. Not the most commanding voice, but they clearly are very passionate about the subject matter, I particularly recommend their videos on Treasure Planet and, Dr Strangelove.

Lindsay Ellis did a whole series of videos on queer film theory among other subjects, using the Michael Bay Transformers films as the study, as well as a very good three part series on The Hobbit trilogy, a dissection of GoT season 8 and (assuming it hasn't been taken down, not sure) a funny examination of 'Dadaist masterpiece' Freddie Got Fingered.",best YouTube video
