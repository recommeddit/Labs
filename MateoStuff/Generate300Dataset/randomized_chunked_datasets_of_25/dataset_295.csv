33544,best electric car,"Having test driven the ID.4 single motor I have to say that I was really impressed with it. The auto reviewers have made it out to seem so mediocre that it completely smashed those expectations. For $31k for the base model here in California after tax credits it’s an insanely good value. This is a vehicle for people coming from ICE RAV4’s, CR-V’s etc. looking to buy their first EV. And the ID.4 is a lot nicer than the RAV4 I rented."
23769,best car racing video game,"Flatout.  Backwoods down 'n dirty hillbilly racing is best racing and this hits closest to the mark for me.

5664,best programming language for web development,"You may want to check out [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/). It is basically a free online self-paced coding bootcamp. It has seven courses that use the best tutorials from around the web, and organize them into the proper order to give a relatively gentle learning curve. If you spend several hours a day on it, 5 days a week, you should be able to finish all seven in two or three months I would think. You of course don't have to do all of the courses, but I do recomend doing them in order."
1930,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Patxis is pretty good. I'm a thinner crust kind of person and enjoy theirs. They also do deep dish, which I've never had, but have heard people enjoy it. I've eaten at Patxis with a New Yorker friend that is serious about a good slice and he finds Patxis acceptable."

13901,best research paper archive,"The founder of Sci-hub is a neuroscientist who lives in hiding to maintain this service. Elsevier recently won $15 million in damages against her. ""Public good"" arguments were rejected by the court. Here is a comment on the ruling from Matt McKay, a spokesman for scientific publishers:

""Sci-Hub does not add any value to the scholarly community. It neither fosters scientific advancement nor does it value researchers’ achievements. It is simply a place for someone to go to download stolen content and then leave"".

Please donate to this amazing service if you can afford to.

Off topic but the service continues an idea that may have been popularized by Aaron Swartz, who was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer. Swartz automated a laptop stashed in a closet at MIT to download scientific articles from JSTOR. He committed suicide in 2013 after contributing to multiple projects that enhanced the internet including RSS feeds, Creative Commons, and Reddit.

65853,best college in california,"The only UC's that are ""better than all but the best private schools"" are UC Berkeley and UCLA. The others are fairly average in terms of public college respectability. Those are the only two schools in the UC school system that really contend with the other top schools in the country."
40869,best instrument to play,I asked this question to my lady friends and the majority (AKA 5) said piano.
37265,best amusement park,It’s about half way depending on what part of Detroit. I live in the east side suburbs and it’s a little over 2 hours to either park.
26239,best politician,It always makes me sad that he could not live to see the end of the war it was fairly obvious the allies would win but it would have been nice for him to see the people celebrating after all the hard years of work he put into the effort.
15010,best romantic novel,"I loved it. The only thing that threw me off was that I kept picturing Lucy and Josh as Amy and Dan from the TV show Veep, because my god, do those two dislike each other. And yet, they don't. I'll check out some of the others!"
26249,best politician,"Carter and probably FDR. Also basically the muckrakers from the guilded age. 

Both politicans attempted the impossible (FDR in his attempt to fix great depression era america and Carter trying to fix the middle east) and both should be given marks for their determination."
29510,best game console,"As someone who has relied on PC gaming almost exclusively for the past several years, I find this list immensely helpful.  I hope folks here appreciate this excellent list for pointing out great games we may have missed, rather than as an attack on our glorious principles..."

66734,best soccer team in the world,"Even if England win the next WC, the joke of us being shit in sports that we invented is so ingrained in internet culture, that people will still be saying it.

Besides football, and I suppose rugby, we're having an absolute golden era across loads of sports, but still people take the piss"

55039,best places to hike in the east coast,"Check out the AT from Roan to Grayson Highlands.  Maybe post in r/appalachiantrail - they have a great spreadsheet of hikes based on mileage.

I’d also suggest the Art Loeb trail in NC.

Being from FL, I think you’d be okay hiking in NC and VA above 3k elevation.  It’s cooler in the higher elevations."
