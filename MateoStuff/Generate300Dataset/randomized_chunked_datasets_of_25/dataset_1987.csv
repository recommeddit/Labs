37259,"Well you gotta think about it like this, BGW is mostly pulling in from the tidewater region and southern Va. KD pulls from Richmond and DC/NoVa which are much more populated and people from there probably donâ€™t wanna drive an extra 1.5 hours just to go to BGW. If this map is based off internet searches, KD is located near more densely populated areas which in turn results in more internet searches.

I hope this makes sense, I tried to not sound too technical.",best amusement park

46376,"from what I remember as a kid.... you open the door & immediately not recognize what the kids are dressed up as because you are so out of touch with child fads/culture.  Then you say something like.... ""ooooo look at all the scary... eh...um... so what are you supposed to be?"" Then when the kids tell you .... you STILL have no idea what they are talking about because you still have never heard of it. Then you stumble about verbally saying something like ""Ooooo how scary!"" then you either give or offer some candy.... typically the crappy hard candy kind. Rarely ever the good chocolate kind. 

When i was a kid I went dressed up as a [Gamorian Guard](http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/6/64/Gamorrean-hd.jpg) & not a single person knew what I was. One old bat asked who I was & when i told her.... she said ""oooo a goodmorning Guard""",best trick or treating candy
12139,"I can't speak for everyone, but for me being left alone isn't about not wanting to be with my family or friends. It's about being free knowing that I don't have to consider in any way what they want to do, what they have planned, what they have in mind, how anything makes them feel, or whether or not they need or want any particular thing at a particular time. I can sleep when I'm sleepy, eat when I'm hungry and not have to think more than 10 minutes into the future unless I really want to.

It's not completely about being alone, it's about being free of consideration and compromise for a day.",best gifts for dad

I've posted throughout this thread, but here is a [link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jctb.1087/full) to a paper showing that carbon based filters like the brita remove out organics.

It isn't the ""filtering"" ability of the media that removes the organics, it is the chemical properties associated with the surface that causes them to bind with the surface of the activated carbon, thus removing it.",best water filter
