53398,best usb c charging cable,"I was using a UGREEN USB c cable with my Traktor DJ controller; on the old model it was fine. Switching to the new Mark 3 model suddenly had the controller producing absolutely horrific sound. 

I thought the unit was defective, turns out the cable wasn’t up to snuff. I’ll never use ugreen again."

43001,best detective show,"I've seen it twice all the way through--it was fantastic, but something about it always left me feeling very distant, it's incredible well shot but I never got as involved in it as other shows of its caliber, I can't really put my finger on it. Season 4 got close, and the final episodes are simply iconic, but even then, it still felt like watching TV. I guess other than Walt, and occasionally Jessie, the characters fell a little flat for me. I particularly did not like how his wife's character was written and found her to be very out of place in some of its most crucial moments, almost contradictory or portrayed as dumb, but I can't say it's anything less than incredible!!"
