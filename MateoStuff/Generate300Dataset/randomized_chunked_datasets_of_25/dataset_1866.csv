22721,"I heard this story about Tom Hanks driving past a wedding while filming in South Carolina. He stops his car, jumps out and runs over and greets the entire wedding party and bride and groom. Funny thing is the photographer was in such shock he forgot take any pictures. So Tom Hanks turns around, gets in his car, jumps back out and does it all over again.",best celebrity

67827,"Mixing promises and callbacks has been problematic for me. My existing code base uses callbacks and integrating async/await or promises seems to bite me in the ass. Unhandled promise rejection in the console comes to mind, with a lack of stacktrace. 

Also, I can visualize the event loop with callbacks, I get it. I have no idea what happens with the event loop with async/await and that lack of understanding, leads me away. 

Also, callback hell isnt a thing for me. node-async lib and it wonderful control flow patterns helps a ton.",axios alternatives reddit

67877,"> Three Body Problem is really popular, but definitely not to my taste, I've tried it 3 times and made it about 80% of the way in before saying nope.

Well it is really worth the effort. The first book only sets the scene, it was rather hard to read for me too. If you want you can also just skip ahead, the second and third books will make it worth to get familiar with this universe.",best science fiction novel
43248,"DARK on Netflix is maybe the greatest show of all time. Only “maybe” because there is one more season left (S1 and S2 are out and there will only be 3 seasons total)... Obviously I have some Game of Thrones PTSD with that caveat... but seriously it’s PHENOMENAL. Magical even.

For what it’s worth, S1 of TD came out two years after I moved to New Orleans (the actress who played Dora Lange was my neighbor I shit you not. ) So I have a very special place in my ❤️ for TDs1 and DARK still beats it by a hair.

Yes it’s German. Yes you have to pay attention. But it’s amazing and worth it. It’s better in subtitles than dubbed, but if you make it to episode 4 or 5 you’ll already be locked in to be watching the series more than once anyway cause it’s that damn good and will blow you mind 🤯 

The way you could tell that Nick P spent the first half of his life crafting S1 of True Detective in his head comes through the same way with the attention to detail and nuance in DARK. 

For what it’s worth here’s my tops:
1) Breaking Bad
2) DARK
3) True Detective S1
4) Fargo

Mindhunter
Select GOT (not s8)
Ozark

Always Sunny in Philly
Chernobyl 
Fear the walking dead s1-s3 (after season 3 is utter dogshit but before that is exceptional. Just pretend they all die at the end of 3.) 

You’re welcome for anyone who watches DARK because of this rant. Glad I could enrich your life that extra bit. 😉",best detective show

64771,"Seafood dive: I highly recommend [On The Alley](https://www.onthealley.com/welcome-santabarbara/) at the harbor. Get the fish tacos or fish and chips and a beer. Ignore the rest of the menu. Sit at communal table or walk out to breakwater. You now win at dates. 

Mexican dive: El Sitio — you know it's legit because they don't have some fancy pants website. Just plastic tables, spicy pico de gallo, and the greatest burritos on earth. Get the rajas or pastor burrito. Get both and eat for a week. IMO, all respect to others opinions etc, Lily's tacos is mediocre and to be avoided. 

Burger Dive: Go to the original [Habit Burger](https://www.habitburger.com/charburger/) location in Goleta. Better than In & Out any day. Then walk down to the Mercury Lounge (bonus round: chillest bar) to drink a beer and play jenga. Or go to the location on State St. and watch as people walk by and glare enviously at your double charburger and onion rings. 

Breakfast Dive: Get an acai bowl from [Backyard Bowls](http://www.backyardbowls.com/menu-2) and walk it next door so you can have coffee from Santa Barbara Roasting Company. This is not even close to the best coffee in town, but go anyway because eating something partially frozen for breakfast requires a cup of hot coffee or tea. That's just math. 

Bonus (not a dive): Go to [C'est Cheese](http://cestcheese.com/cafe/) for lunch. Baked goods, sandwiches, and beautiful seasonal salads, and very good coffee. 

Protip: This town is full (FULL!) of overpriced and mediocre tourist trap restaurants. usually they are suspiciously empty, but some have mastered the disguise of quality (looking at you, Pascucci). When in doubt, identify locals from our tote bags, yoga mats, and patagonia nanopuff jackets and sneakily follow us to see where we eat. 

Good luck & enjoy!",best places to eat in Santa Barbara
