2484,"Huh, who knew. I honestly dont care. Upvotes and downvotes mean nothing, I am just here for conversation. 

Earbuds are headphones in my eyes. They go in my ear and I can listen to music. I cant stand on-head headphones. They are to bulky and I cant store them anywhere. they would be just one more thing for me to carry. 

But a few things to note here. 1. Skullcandy are by far the best that I have ever owned. You can map out my entire life by what pair of headphones I had at any given time. Ill admit, headphone technology has come along way since the early 90's and the quality has gotten better and better, But I have never had a pair of headphones last through what I can put Skullcandies through, nor have I had a pair that can match their quality of sound, especially for earbuds. I have owned them all, Sony, Bose, JVC, Philips, AKG, Razor for my gaming, the list goes on. (and can we please not talk about Beats by DRE, my god) They were like shoes to me. Give them six months to a year, and they would short out, break, or just simply fall apart at the seams. I have had the same pair of SC for over two years now. I dont really need to go on about this
2. I am poor. 20-30 bucks is a luxury to me. So that two years of not buying another pair of headphones has saved me a lot of money. I could never justify buying headphones that costed as much as you mentioned. That is another reason why I stick to them. Even at their cheapest pair,($15) the quality of sound and materials is phenomenal compared to other brands you can get at that price. 

Now, I am an open person. Im willing to try out something new. Give me some brands you would recommend and I will check them out. If you can give me something better than SC, I will erase everything I have said.",best headphones

41213,"If you like Celtic music and are familiar with flute, a tin whistle could be a good choice. You can buy one for £5, so can give it a go with minimal investment and give one to a kid without worrying it will destroy it. There's a fantastic book by Grey Larsen, Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle, that covers everything from basics like how to hold it, right up to some really advanced songs. If you then want to take it further, an Irish flute is basically a large tin whistle with a proper flute embouchure hole, all the fingering is the same, so what you've already learnt transfers over",best instrument to play
