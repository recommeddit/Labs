6030,best programming language for web development,"A friend of mine is an Android developer; after I told him about Kotlin, he took it to his team, and after review, they jumped straight on the bandwagon. They're porting every app in their portfolio over the course of the next year.

I'm not familiar with Android development, but I have worked with Java in the past...For something to be _that_ appealing, I'd imagine it's got to have some pretty great features.  Like everything, only time will tell, but the outlook seems good."

65986,best college in california,"Merced above Santa Cruz!?! While I'm sad for the Banana Slugs, in a way I'm relieved to see the UC system's big investment in Merced paying off. That said, let's all take USNWR with a grain of salt. It's just one of many rankings. Forbes just put Berkeley #1 overall. Go Bears! (https://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/)"

14803,best romantic novel,"The Dream Hunter is my favorite Kinsale book. It’s rarely mentioned when ppl talk about her works but it’s in my top 5. The world she built, the H’s innermost thoughts and vulnerability, the  ability to describe love and the falling into it btwn the h/H simply beautiful.

Ivory has the same magical touch with words and while I admired the beauty of Black Silk it’s not one I want to reread over and over. She wrote Bliss and Dance under her pseudonym Judy Cuevas, both are high quality and lush."

2484,best headphones,"Huh, who knew. I honestly dont care. Upvotes and downvotes mean nothing, I am just here for conversation. 

Earbuds are headphones in my eyes. They go in my ear and I can listen to music. I cant stand on-head headphones. They are to bulky and I cant store them anywhere. they would be just one more thing for me to carry. 

But a few things to note here. 1. Skullcandy are by far the best that I have ever owned. You can map out my entire life by what pair of headphones I had at any given time. Ill admit, headphone technology has come along way since the early 90's and the quality has gotten better and better, But I have never had a pair of headphones last through what I can put Skullcandies through, nor have I had a pair that can match their quality of sound, especially for earbuds. I have owned them all, Sony, Bose, JVC, Philips, AKG, Razor for my gaming, the list goes on. (and can we please not talk about Beats by DRE, my god) They were like shoes to me. Give them six months to a year, and they would short out, break, or just simply fall apart at the seams. I have had the same pair of SC for over two years now. I dont really need to go on about this
2. I am poor. 20-30 bucks is a luxury to me. So that two years of not buying another pair of headphones has saved me a lot of money. I could never justify buying headphones that costed as much as you mentioned. That is another reason why I stick to them. Even at their cheapest pair,($15) the quality of sound and materials is phenomenal compared to other brands you can get at that price. 

Now, I am an open person. Im willing to try out something new. Give me some brands you would recommend and I will check them out. If you can give me something better than SC, I will erase everything I have said."
32563,best vacation resort,"...Because now she associates cruises with work, and wants to party as far from the waves as she can?

...Because she wouldn't be able to turn off the part of her brain that would nitpick all the safety regulations the crew would be skimming past?

...Because she's had to watch cruise liners sink, and would never risk it?"
41213,best instrument to play,"If you like Celtic music and are familiar with flute, a tin whistle could be a good choice. You can buy one for £5, so can give it a go with minimal investment and give one to a kid without worrying it will destroy it. There's a fantastic book by Grey Larsen, Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle, that covers everything from basics like how to hold it, right up to some really advanced songs. If you then want to take it further, an Irish flute is basically a large tin whistle with a proper flute embouchure hole, all the fingering is the same, so what you've already learnt transfers over"
