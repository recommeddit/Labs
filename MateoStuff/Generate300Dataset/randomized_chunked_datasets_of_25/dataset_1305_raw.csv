"I’m realizing this year has not been very impressive. Every album I almost listed was a 2020 project.

Tha Landlord - “Far From Perfect” is about the only album worth mentioning so far. Good production. Nice features (Lito and Don Trip)."
"They kill the ‘main character’, it was completely unheard of at the time. She’s kind of just a vehicle for the plot to get to the real main character."
"Better yet, buy a good internal hard drive and put it in an external enclosure. Hard drive fails or you need a new one? If your enclosure is still compatible (and it might as well be), just take the old hard drive out and put the new one in.

This might go over $100, but if you don't have an eSATA port on your computer, get an adapter to fit in one of your expansion slots. USB 2.0 is slow for data transfer. Heck, it beats out USB 3.0."
"That John Cusack movie ""Identity"" - a bunch of strangers end up stuck together at a hotel after the roads get flooded. Ever so often the scene would cut to a guy being evauated at a mental ward.  
Anyways, people in the hotel start getting murdered.

Twist part:


They're all different personalities in the patients head, and it's a process where the docs are getting rid of his multiple personality disorder.  Only problem is, one of the personalities is a murderer..."

Pretty sure it's 11:30 and 90 degrees here in Austin right now.  Nice Texas night.
I hate murder season.
"Nice list!

Power Grid is a great auction game as well."
"My mom plays Xbox games, so I'm getting her Wolfenstein II."
"Yeah, now, but he wasn’t in his first appearance. We gotta take what we can get!"
Lol it isn’t sonically diverse enough. An album can afford to sound kinda samey if the production has a lot of depth but Illmatic doesn’t. It’s simple bass/piano lines and simple drum patterns. Also “your opinion is boring” are we in 4th grade?
"I thought so too. I couldn't find it when I looked just a few weeks ago. 

I had only caught pieces of it when it aired. I'm trying to watch it from the beginning now. Not sure if I like it so much. I'm unimpressed with the first few episodes. Is it worth sticking with it?"

"That wasn't my question homie. That's for visual purposes. I would've at least appreciated a suggestion, but it's cool."
Nah I'm gonna just gonna keep stamping down when my foot is clearly smashing the back of my shoe but I have to keep trying because I am holding my blenderbottle and yogurt and keys and 3 other things in my hands on my way out of the house.
"Thank you so much for this. You and whoever else contributes to this list.

I just discovered MVNOs. Also that online excel sheet is so easy to use with multiple filters and sorts."
Agreed. It actually gives him more respect in my opinion.
