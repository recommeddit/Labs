23792,best car racing video game,"I have to say that Project Cars 1 was most frustrating racing game i have ever played with controller. It clearly wasnt meant to be played with controller, even after tweaking settings it never really felt right. Driving Formula/ higher than GT3 class car while its raining was just unplayable(either you go too slow or you spin if your throttle control wasnt perfect, every single corner), and i consider myself as above average driver. I have played racing games since Toca Race Drivers, so i have played many different racing games. GT Sport just feels right even with controller. It lacks customization and all that fancy stuff, unnecessary or not depending what you want, but driving is satisfying and unmatched on PS4.

Edit: Forgot to tell that they have most likely made it better on PC2, but i have heard its still made mainly for wheels. I think someone here share my complains about PC1 and can confirm if PC2 still feels the same. For the record i havent played PC2 so this is straight up speculation based on reviews/comments i have seen and my experience with the first one."

52230,best hiphop album,"Liquid swords-GZA, In my opinion a bit better then say 36 but both are amazing albums.

To Pimp A Butterfly-Kendrick Lamar, the best Kendrick album and arguably one of the best Hip-hop albums of all time.

Illmatic-Nas, old heads love it, new heads love it it's probably the most quintessential Hip-hop albums. 

 Atrocity Exhibition-Danny Brown, probably the most controversial pick on the list but this is garnderd as some of the best experimental Hip-Hop albums of the last decade and the best album Danny has made."

30293,best Mexican war to study,"It doesn't have a huge emphasis over here other than, ""hey we fought this war against Mexico for a while"". I think we should teach a lot more about it though.

We *do* teach westward expansion and manifest destiny, which is usually seen as the cause of the war."
34168,best NFL player,"Wow. I tip my bowler to you and Boom!, Mr. Madden as well. 

As I am but an armchair QB, I will humbly and respectfully disagree. While he may be a phenom of athleticism, he did not have the weight to be a lineman. Ability for moving blocks? Without question. But even the 80s linemen would have eaten him as an appetizer."

45095,best items under $100,A vintage Parker 51. It's a fountain pen from the 1940s that still writes as if it were fresh out of the factory. I love it because it hearkens back to a time when products designed to last forever. It's an interesting piece of history that will probably last me for the rest of my life.
33738,best electric car,"Love em, but they aren't quite where they need to be for me to justify one:

- Heavy batteries kill handling
- Price is still high for me
- Variety and options are lacking
- Everything is proprietary and requires an electrical engineering degree to troubleshoot/fix problems.
- Batteries have a shelf-life and are extremely expensive to replace."
