23792,"I have to say that Project Cars 1 was most frustrating racing game i have ever played with controller. It clearly wasnt meant to be played with controller, even after tweaking settings it never really felt right. Driving Formula/ higher than GT3 class car while its raining was just unplayable(either you go too slow or you spin if your throttle control wasnt perfect, every single corner), and i consider myself as above average driver. I have played racing games since Toca Race Drivers, so i have played many different racing games. GT Sport just feels right even with controller. It lacks customization and all that fancy stuff, unnecessary or not depending what you want, but driving is satisfying and unmatched on PS4.

Edit: Forgot to tell that they have most likely made it better on PC2, but i have heard its still made mainly for wheels. I think someone here share my complains about PC1 and can confirm if PC2 still feels the same. For the record i havent played PC2 so this is straight up speculation based on reviews/comments i have seen and my experience with the first one.",best car racing video game

To Pimp A Butterfly-Kendrick Lamar, the best Kendrick album and arguably one of the best Hip-hop albums of all time.

Illmatic-Nas, old heads love it, new heads love it it's probably the most quintessential Hip-hop albums. 

 Atrocity Exhibition-Danny Brown, probably the most controversial pick on the list but this is garnderd as some of the best experimental Hip-Hop albums of the last decade and the best album Danny has made.",best hiphop album
