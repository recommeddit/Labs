Edit: The joke was that it's one letter off from goon, and means the same thing as the above comment, though more offensively. Clearly this joke did not go over as well as I had anticipated. I apologize."

65736,best college in california,"I'm not sure if you're serious or not, but no, I don't think so. Just like I don't think UCLA is now ""better"" than Berkeley. 

Some UCs do have better graduate programs (in specific areas of study) than other UCs. Some programs are better funded at some UCs than others. Those rankings matter. But the general undergraduate rankings are pretty useless."

She faked me out and told me to make sure I had my fishing license with me then delivered me to the golf course where my three boys were waiting. We had a wonderful day.

73766,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I have a friend have ipad with matte screen protector and is loving it. But the image quality looked terrible for watching videos etc. it was a dealbreaker for me as it has such an amazing speaker quality but by applying the matte it turned out not what someone would expect. 

So I got myself a normal screen protector and I’m pretty much in love with that. Sure it took 1-2 days to adjust but it was worth it plus it didn’t made much impact on my handwriting considering I usually write around 10-11 hrs a day."
