34154,best NFL player,"It's *reeeaaallly* hard to narrow it down to one, I'd have to go with Jim Brown.  
I can honestly say he'd have all the rushing records if he would have played more than 8 years. The man's a beast."
53832,best medicine for a cold,"My mother swore by these when I was growing up, but all they did was make me nauseated."
15584,best tree for the garden,"If it's in the US. I would go with something native, like persimmons or pawpaws and also include hazelnuts. These are things you don't often see in the store, they're easy to maintain and could fetch a premium on the boutique side of things."

I wear prescription glasses daily (I'm short sighted) and it sucks I can't have lenses put in these because I adore them but I totally can't see when I wear them.  But I always get comments on the shape and style.  They're classic but with a twist."

52406,best hiphop album,"It's not accurate. But those are good albums. Madvilliany and Endtroducing are definitely not top 10 albums of all time but that doesn't take away the Classic album status. Kendrick bring on there twice is laughable but those are great albums. Nas, Wu tang and tribes albums are debatable. I haven't heard Danny Browns album so I can't say much there. Kanye has a couple Classics that can be debated over MBDTF. Just my opinion though."

41265,best instrument to play,"At least you aren't at the mercy of a fragile piece of cane.  Those things can get fiddly, and can change behavior during a concert when the weather changes.

This year, I think I am going to get her an electric blanket that plugs into the cigarette lighter of the car. Can't use it while driving obvs but my brother-in-law has one and swears by it for when he's riding shotgun. Seems like something she would really like."

55100,best places to hike in the east coast,"Yes, Mt. Mitchell is 400 feet taller than Mt. Washington (6,684 to 6,288).  But it's so much warmer and further south, you don't get the same alpine climate effect."
