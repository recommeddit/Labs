13111,best gifts for mom,"This year, I'm getting my Mom perfume (it's on her list)- but last year, we got my parents tickets to the zoo.  So the four of us went, had a BLAST, and then my husband and I bought lunch and beers after.  Lots of fun memories!!  My Mom always took me to the zoo when I was a baby, so it was fun seeing her experience as an adult and her pointing out all of the animals I loved as a kid."

I know I'm sacrificing by going wireless, I'm looking for the least bad option here."
33506,best electric car,"If you've spent anytime with the current crop of EVs this isn't surprising. Tesla really does build a better electric car than everyone else so far because they think holistically rather than trying to fit ICE thinking into a BEV. 

Having said that, you can admit that Tesla builds a phenomenal EV and still not like them. It's not all or nothing. Personal preference will always play a part."

62055,Best RPG game on PS4,"I played it for hours! But after 2-3 days of not playing, i got bored and found it to be stupidly repetitive =/ Go to a zone, get the items, kill the boss, new zone, more items, new zone, more items... And each item has a different ability, so getting them all is really boring after a while =/"

56745,best desktop monitor,"Second this. Picked it up from jet.com for like $95, and regularly is ~$100. My GF loves it, but you get what you pay for. It's a lower end IPS panel, but better than others at the price."

71273,best movies with a cool twist,No. It actually is a pretty good twist.
55620,best action and adventure novel series,"Some have already been mentioned but I would recommend
The Dresden Files - Jim Butcher.
The Riftwar trilogy - Raymond E Feist.
The Blade Itself - Joe Abercrombie

Also if you have never read them, I would say essential fantasy/sci fi reading includes Dune and The Silmarillion."
11167,best backpack for college,"This is what I've used for 3 years with a MBP on my back daily on the bike/mass transit to work.  The pack itself is meh, but it's kept my laptop well-protected.

Definitely not a BIFL, unless you count replacements from REI (or similar).  I had a zipper break about a year ago, so I'm on my second pack.  It doesn't feel any sturdier than the first, so I'd give it a couple years, tops.  If you're just looking to pay once, great, but if you're looking for craftsmanship you're probably not looking at anything North Face anyway.

Also, as a personal preference, the outside front pocket is shockingly useless.  Nothing stays in the loose compartments, and the zippers opening it cause all the small things you tend to keep there to shoot out in all directions."
62417,Best RPG game on PS4,I would say Soulsborne is a better example of a modern action RPG. The rpg elements in games like Horizon and AC Odyssey are pretty basic and barebones. While in games like Dark Souls the RPG mechanics are far more prominent and core to the gameplay. Soulsborne is far more reliant on stat building and management.
2375,best headphones,"If you want really quality wireless your best bet is a good wired headset and a bluetooth dac/amp like the fiio btr5 or one of shanlings options. 

For built in wireless though I think the best in that price range is probably a hifiman deva (or the bt version of the Ananda if you want to jump up in price)"
69062,best science fiction novel,"Lots of good reads in these comments.  Here's a few that I also like. 

Gateway by Frederik Pohl (won Hugo)

Old Man's War by John Scalzi  (nominated for Hugo)

Downbelow Station by C. J. Cherryh (won Hugo)"
42898,best detective show,Well it did make me think long after it was finsihed. I still think about it.
72423,best keyboard switches,"Any switch you feel comfortable with really. I'm sure there's a bit of mechanical optimization in actuation to reaction times with short stroke linear switches, but I can't imagine they actually make a difference to anyone that doesn't have nearly inhumane reaction speeds anyhow. If they key works when you press it, it's good.

Something that can make a notable difference is n-key rollover, i.e.: how many (n) buttons you can press at the same time whilst each press being individually registered and translated into action. Most proper keyboards have no issues with that but cheap ones made for office work may not have it and if you press several keys at the same time, but if you're looking to get a mechanical keyboard I would assume that to be included given the now typical target audience and price range for that gear.

&#x200B;

You could go to a local hardware store and go through the exhibition keyboards and just type away until you find something that feels comfortable, then check which keys that model uses and search for whatever keyboard using the same switch you fancy.

Or you can get extra fancy and get something like the QPAD Mk-95 keyboard which has linear AND tactile+clicky switches at the same time that you switch between with a mechanical lever. No idea if there's other keyboards like this around. That's a wee bit expensive though, the keyboard retails for \~200 bucks and I only got it since I could score it at significantly lower price, ... plus my current keyboard was starting to have a couple switches giving out and all the other keyboards I was eyeing were out-of-stock. Can't say I'm disappointed though.

Personally I can say I don't really ""feel"" any difference between playing with the linear or clicky switches, I just use the linear ones for gaming because they're quieter (and honestly, if I can switch key types on-the-fly, I'm gonna use it!).

&#x200B;

One thing I would generally advise: for gear like keyboards, don't go cheap. A solid build quality keyboard will last you for years. If you get cheap ones with poor build quality that you have to replace in relatively short order you may end up paying more over the same timeframe. Last keyboard (QPAD Mk-85) I had lasted for \~5 years before some switches started getting mushy/failing to register key strokes every now and then."

23660,best car racing video game,"1 & 2 are very simulation heavy racing games that are still popular in the simulation community, so there's a lot of vitriol from that still, because 3 tried going for a wider audience/tried streamlining a lot of things."
47658,best state to visit in the United States,Came here to say the Sandhills. Grass covered dunes might not sound like much but it's the largest system of sand dunes in North America and is also the largest wetland ecosystem in the country. It's native pre-settlement state is something like 90+% intact. Driving through it in May should be on everyone's to do list.
