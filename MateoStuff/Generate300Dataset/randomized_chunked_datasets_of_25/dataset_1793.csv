43368,best ad service for mobile applications,"I use Adaway for global, and lucky patcher for app specific. As a result j never have to deal with ads. YouTube is a different ballpark, for that I have to flash YouTube Vanced."
73059,best Linux distro,"I would say that you probably need to learn the ups and downs of a ""Rolling Release"" and a monolithic release.

Determine whether you would rather deal with *essentially* a reinstall every development cycle and do patches or whether you would rather keep to a rolling release where you do your own rollouts when you feel the installed tree is stable.  

Find out from IT if anyone has strong knowledge of any distro -- thats going to be a big help post install.  Every distro is ever so different (usually in insidious ways) and having even just one local person with good knowledge can save a lot of time and hassle."
