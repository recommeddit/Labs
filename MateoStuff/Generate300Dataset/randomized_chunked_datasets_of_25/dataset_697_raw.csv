Home Depot is closer so I go there 90% of the time. From what I can tell they both carry pretty much the same stuff and prices are similar. If Lowe's was closer I would go there instead.

"I can think of at least a hundred places that sell vanilla ice cream within 20 miles of my house. You don't have to jump on a plane to Prague to get it, man.

**edit:** for everybody who took me and my claims of 100 places seriously, most convenience stores in Austin (or around Texas and California, from my experience) have a small freezer in them that sell pints of ice cream. On top of that, every grocery store sells vanilla ice cream. There are ice cream shops and restaurants everywhere, and I challenge you to find a restaurant with a dessert menu that doesn't have vanilla ice cream. I can deduce that if given a 20 mile radius of Austin, TX, I could find at least 100 locations that sell vanilla ice cream."
Got the Aubergine for my Midnight Green 11 Pro Max. I think it’s a sick combo.
"I have google fi and the data is just horrendous if you’re travelling. Having said that I don’t know how it compares to others, but I would expect a good provider to not throttle “unlimited data” so quickly and to work well when travelling abroad. (Travelling in Europe was hard with google fi, it was just so freaking slow.)"

"I always feel dirty comparing the two. While Don Hutson was definitely the more dominant player during his time, it was a completely different era. Both were excellent, but they really played a different game so I can't really see how anyone can say that one was better than the other."

"I love Hilton Head. My grandma has a timeshare there right on the beach and we go every year in June. It's feels like my second home.

"Carry a bottle of water, some hand soap & a reusable quick dry towel in your car. Wash your hands after every stop, every errand. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. After. Every. Errand.  Just let the water flow out onto the parking lot or street. Dry your hands. Get into your car secure in the knowledge that your hands are cleaner than if you used a hand sanitizer."
"None of them, and all of them. Depends on your point of view, and what you think the real goals vs the stated goals for each of those missions."
"Definitely agree. But how do you find out? Also doesn't that sort of *become* your smell? On a trip with some friends they smelled my cologne and said, ""Oh my god, it smells like u/Khasimir""."
