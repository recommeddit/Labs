May I ask what kind problems do you work on with Bayesian methods? As other posters have said, Bayesian models are generally slower to train and do not result in quite as good results as say, XGboost. 

I have read some parts of statistical rethinking, watched the course videos on youtube, read Bayesian Methods for Hackers  plus a mishmash of other resource and I still cannot really think of a problem where I'd rather use a bayesian model over the usual suspects (xgboost, lightgbm). The only place I might use say, pymc3, is if it's an inference problem and I have to come up with solid numbers to back my claim so I'm curious to know what others use it for."

I use gentoo for some good reasons.
Tack on *Red Mars* and *Accelerando* and you have yourself a deal!
KW is nice for the price. I have a pair of the aviators for when I don't wear my oakley's.
Yeah itâ€™s part of it. As someone else commented above the French and Indian war was a theatre of the larger Seven Years War. Though I believe the French and Indian War was a little longer. And it was France and England (US wasnâ€™t a country yet).

"I was scrolling through to see if anyone mentioned ""The Fountain."" I'll second it of course. I'd also throw in Ender's Game."
I always time my sets with the drop.
"I see. If they don't require the laptop to have dedicated graphics, I'd assume that integrated graphics should be fine. Can you link the Samsung laptop you're looking at for me?"

"Right, but that's even more niche, and the people who really want great quality will buy a dedicated webcam which will always be better than what can be put in a laptop."
"I saw Brock Lesnar in the hospital cafeteria while his wife was having a baby. He noticed me kinda staring, so he called me over and said hello. I told him my son was a big fan of his, and he replied ""tell your son I'm a big fan of his!"" We shook hands and I let him finish eating.

"CliFM is not written in Haskell, it's written in C. And yes, it might be a bit weird, because it is unique in this respect, but that's the price for keeping the shell always in sight. As everything nonetheless, there are pros and cons."
"May not be quite what you are looking for, but here is an alternative to the popular Anker. The $15 [Xtar PB2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D48V1Y7) along with a couple $4 [2500mah 1865s](https://www.18650batterystore.com/18650-p/samsung-25r-18650.htm) will let you scale your power needs up and down by carrying more or fewer rechargeable li-ion cells.

Xtar recently came out with a [larger version](https://www.illumn.com/xtar-pb2s-qc-3-0-pd-3-0-portable-li-ion-charger-and-powerbank-red.html) that supports the bigger 21700 cells."
"I really liked Blackfish, but I eventually found out that film is pretty biased too."
"Yeah I used to love Gran Turismo 2-4, fucking loved that shit.  They are stuck because it's a console game sold to kids.  It's just going to continue to shit out the same iterations because it's what the people want. 

It's been too long for them to change.  It's like giving Madden a complete overhaul, not gonna happen as long as it keeps selling."
"it's more unbelievable that 4 out of 5 dentists always prefer yours

I'd mix it up with a 3 out of 5"

This is untrue.  Your digestive tract is filled to the brim with ions from the food you eat.  Your body doesn't act like a collection of billions of ideal cells all in petri dishes.
