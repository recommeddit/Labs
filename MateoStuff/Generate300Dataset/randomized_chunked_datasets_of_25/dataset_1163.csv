I wrote a [guide](http://blog.nawaz.org/posts/2012/Dec/a-guide-to-midnight-commander/) to Midnight Commander (PDF Presentation). You could go through it to get an idea of the capabilities.

With MC, you still have your shell - so you give up nothing. By definition, it *can't* be worse than the shell.

I've never found anyone who can manipulate files faster than I can with Midnight Commander - be they shell folks or GUI folks.",best terminal file manager reddit
22634,"yea, joel is a dick.

I had a friend who scored some backstage passes to a festival he was playing at. This was sometime right after he DJ'd at the VMAs (i wanna say that was 2011 but i don't really remember) so they hype for him was pretty high. We were just hanging around backstage while he did his set, he came off stage, ditched his mouse head, and started digging around in one of the coolers for something to drink. Not realizing who it was i asked ""Hey buddy, mind throwing me a drink?"" and he turns around, askes ""Don't you know who i am? i don't get paid to be your beverage boy, so get it yourself"" and he storms off.

now granted i didn't recognize him at first because this was a music festival and seeing some scrawny guy back stage covered in shitty meme-atic and video game tattoos was like being a piece of hay in a haystack. and you could kind of excuse it as coming off of an hour long set in a hot mouse head. but apparently he used to (or still does, i'm not sure) stream his time in his studio and its pretty clear that he's just an all around cunt. He's like the worst parts of /b/ personified, which makes sense since he's claimed he posts there",best celebrity

8 cores vs 6 don't (yet) make a difference for gaming. For everything productivity, the more cores the better so an 8-core wouldn't make a ""best workstation"" category either.

Fluoride in toothpaste is helpful at reducing decay, but for people who rarely or never get decay, because of a low sugar, non-cariogenic diet, it probably isn't essential. Toothpastes aren't useless, they help, some may reduce calculus accumulation a tad, but it is the action of either manual or sonic toothbrush bristles that physically breaks up plaque accumulation that is most important.",best toothpaste
