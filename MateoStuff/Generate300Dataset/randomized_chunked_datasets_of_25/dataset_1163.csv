31122,best country to live in,"A lot of the Kiwi's that go to Aus go to earn enough money to buy a house, they often come back. The ones that want to live urban stay overseas, as we don't have the population to support a large city/lifestyle."
23609,best car racing video game,TDU1 was such a damn good game.
165,best terminal file manager reddit,"Bash commands require a lot more keystrokes than some file managers. 

I wrote a [guide](http://blog.nawaz.org/posts/2012/Dec/a-guide-to-midnight-commander/) to Midnight Commander (PDF Presentation). You could go through it to get an idea of the capabilities.

With MC, you still have your shell - so you give up nothing. By definition, it *can't* be worse than the shell.

I've never found anyone who can manipulate files faster than I can with Midnight Commander - be they shell folks or GUI folks."
22634,best celebrity,"yea, joel is a dick.

I had a friend who scored some backstage passes to a festival he was playing at. This was sometime right after he DJ'd at the VMAs (i wanna say that was 2011 but i don't really remember) so they hype for him was pretty high. We were just hanging around backstage while he did his set, he came off stage, ditched his mouse head, and started digging around in one of the coolers for something to drink. Not realizing who it was i asked ""Hey buddy, mind throwing me a drink?"" and he turns around, askes ""Don't you know who i am? i don't get paid to be your beverage boy, so get it yourself"" and he storms off.

now granted i didn't recognize him at first because this was a music festival and seeing some scrawny guy back stage covered in shitty meme-atic and video game tattoos was like being a piece of hay in a haystack. and you could kind of excuse it as coming off of an hour long set in a hot mouse head. but apparently he used to (or still does, i'm not sure) stream his time in his studio and its pretty clear that he's just an all around cunt. He's like the worst parts of /b/ personified, which makes sense since he's claimed he posts there"

40208,best midrange CPU,"> not a single 8-core CPU made the list 

8 cores vs 6 don't (yet) make a difference for gaming. For everything productivity, the more cores the better so an 8-core wouldn't make a ""best workstation"" category either. 

Which just kind of goes to show that these types of lists aren't really all that representative"

8963,best toothpaste,"Yes, brushing with only water is quite effective and the difference between expensive vs cheap toothpaste is quite small to nonexistent. Fluoride in toothpaste is helpful at reducing decay, but for people who rarely or never get decay, because of a low sugar, non-cariogenic diet, it probably isn't essential. Toothpastes aren't useless, they help, some may reduce calculus accumulation a tad, but it is the action of either manual or sonic toothbrush bristles that physically breaks up plaque accumulation that is most important."
