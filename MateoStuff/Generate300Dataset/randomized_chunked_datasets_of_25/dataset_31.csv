148,best terminal file manager reddit,I like ranger for the terminal and pcmanfm for gui.
6659,best iPhone,"I recently upgraded to an iPhone 12 from an iPhone 8. I'm a mild social media user, play very casual games (like solitaire), I FaceTime my girlfriend every day for 1/2-1 hour, and I can go a day and a half at least on one charge. I'm pretty sure the mini less battery life, and coming from someone with very small hands and a regular sized iPhone 8, the mini was too small for me. The Max is just a bigger version of the more recent iPhones, and the Pro just means it has the 3 cameras instead of 2."

27710,best bollywood actor,"Ranbir from new gen. AB from old crop. Ashok Kumar from even before. These are stars. My list of favorite actors is too long. 
Rk is dangerous actor. He is rare original actor in current crop with natural style of acting. 
AB's hey day movies needs to be watched on big screen with his fans. He was magic. I thank my cinephile mom for the opportunity. He is solid theater. 
Ashok kumar for being the actor who influenced diverse actors like dilip, dev anand and AB. His style and mannerism have been copied again and again,Only actor who had complete control over his career and made seemless transitition to charecter acting without being outed as old. Again he is natural actor."
13788,best research paper archive,"Now I'm no expert on DNA structure (I know more about proteins) but...

Wikipedia says :
>An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to adopt the A-form geometry rather than the B-form most commonly observed in DNA

And W&C made a model of *B-DNA* not A. So I think they had a point. Incidentally, the iconic double helix image in that paper was drawn by Crick's wife, Odile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odile_Crick).

(oh, and I signed up to post this :)"

53071,best hiphop album,Y’all on some other shit
34252,best NFL player,"Really hard to rate Dak right now... on one hand you could unfairly down grade him based on injury, on the other you could unfairly up grade him based on insane unsustainable stats from a short season. 6th best definitely seems like the current ceiling of the rankings. It is definitely generous, but not completely indefensible."
16250,best sunglasses for fashion,"Sierra Trading Post always has a variety of (sunglasses)[https://www.sierratradingpost.com/mens-sunglasses~d~9811/].  

They have a bunch of good-quality non-Luxotica stuff.

I scored a pair of sweet French made Julbos here last year.   

Their inventory is always changing, so if you don't see something just check back in a couple of months."

69366,best major to study in college,Majored in marketing and minored in sales. I don't regret my minor at all and I owe everything to my sales program to where I got to be. My marketing degree is pretty useless though. I wish I did software engineering.
44323,best items under $100,"Sewing scissors. Ultra-sharp, strong, and classy-looking. They make short work of everything.

None of that flimsy plastic-handled office scissor shit."
62531,Best RPG game on PS4,"Been playing Skyrim vr, if you don’t own psvr I recommend the remastered version."
42202,movies like Inception,"It surprised me with how good it was, especially for a film that is carried mainly by only 3 actors. Won't go into detail as not to spoil for OP but the scene with the protagonist and his arm was particularly jarring, more for his reasons behind doing it than the act itself"
21006,best workout music,I been running to Lupe's whole discography the last week or so. So many songs I forgot about. I get lost in his wordplay and storytelling sometimes that I forget I'm even running. If I'm doing more of an intense workout Run the Jewels does it for me.specifically RTJ2. Shit makes me wanna fight.
18376,best YouTube video,"The first time I saw this, there were legit tears"
57137,best water brand,Fiji is my favourite. Second favourite is President's Choice. My sisters said they saw no difference in bottled water so I made them do a taste test with 3 different kinds of water plus mine. Everyone agreed mine was the best. Then they were tucked at me for making them hate their waters. Lol

Sticking with Chris Nolan movies, the Prestige is flippin' amazing. One of the best movies I have ever seen, period.
