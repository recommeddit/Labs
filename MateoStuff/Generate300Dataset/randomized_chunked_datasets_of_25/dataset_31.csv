6659,"I recently upgraded to an iPhone 12 from an iPhone 8. I'm a mild social media user, play very casual games (like solitaire), I FaceTime my girlfriend every day for 1/2-1 hour, and I can go a day and a half at least on one charge. I'm pretty sure the mini less battery life, and coming from someone with very small hands and a regular sized iPhone 8, the mini was too small for me. The Max is just a bigger version of the more recent iPhones, and the Pro just means it has the 3 cameras instead of 2.",best iPhone

Rk is dangerous actor. He is rare original actor in current crop with natural style of acting. 
AB's hey day movies needs to be watched on big screen with his fans. He was magic. I thank my cinephile mom for the opportunity. He is solid theater. 
Ashok kumar for being the actor who influenced diverse actors like dilip, dev anand and AB. His style and mannerism have been copied again and again,Only actor who had complete control over his career and made seemless transitition to charecter acting without being outed as old. Again he is natural actor.",best bollywood actor
13788,"Now I'm no expert on DNA structure (I know more about proteins) but...

Wikipedia says :
>An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to adopt the A-form geometry rather than the B-form most commonly observed in DNA

And W&C made a model of *B-DNA* not A. So I think they had a point. Incidentally, the iconic double helix image in that paper was drawn by Crick's wife, Odile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odile_Crick).
