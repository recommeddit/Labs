John Wick is a good one.
These are good points. Handling connection errors separately from specific error codes is something to consider.
What about Barfi?
Well that would be an interesting marketing strategy

Isn't there some sort of law against not providing a story with posts like this? Please?
That's a big part of what makes reading the labels so important! These drugs make it *very* cagey that they don't contain any FDA-approved active ingredients. I've always thought it's kind of messed up they're even allowed to be sold at drug stores next to the real stuff.

"As someone who's been dying for another Underground, Heat was such a disappointment for me. I know NFS has always been the arcade-y racing series but Heat took it to a whole other level with the ""release the gas and press it again to enter drift mode"" thing. It felt *awful* to drive like that, and I couldn't find anyway to disable it so I had to just uninstall.

Edit: Seems there is an option to toggle it off now? Definitely wasn't a thing when it first came out 'cause I even searched online for an answer to this. Perhaps I'll give it another go now."
"The only restaurants I wouldn’t remove are brophies, la super rica and coldspring tavern (just for the atmosphere). All the other places are overly bourgeoisie hipster places that aren’t special."
I have been using annonymouse for a while and they have decent content and a good bonus system to keep ratios high.  It's a great private tracker as long as you follow the community rules.

Thanks for the advice! I was just searching reddit reviews on here. A few people complaining about it and recommended the pro over air. Appreciate the info very much.
"> I don't personally understand how HP has adult appeal.

“Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.” - C.S. Lewis

(Harry Potter is read by far too many adults for someone to validly suggest it doesn't have adult appeal, whatever that is. ""Having spent eighteen years upwards alive"" as a trait is too broadly distributed to be useful as a distinguishing factor.)

Your argument is resistant to outside interference for the most part - HP cannot be good because you do not think it's good - though the bit where HP got popular *because* it was popular is pretty ludicrous circular logic. Harry Potter was Rowling's debut work; she was a single mother living on state welfare while she wrote it, and it was rejected by several publishers before someone took a chance on it. It started out *not* popular, but became so on its own merits.

Popularity is not a yardstick to measure quality by, but there are certain qualities a work must possess to become wildly popular in the first place. If one could easily replicate those qualities, tons of talented authors, I'm sure, would write at least one wildly popular book to become financially set for life and then move on to writing ""good"" books."
