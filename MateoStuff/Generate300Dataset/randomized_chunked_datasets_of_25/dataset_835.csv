69792,"Indeed!  I think you're being gracious on the less than one too!

Hence also why software development for the ""young person who hasn't gone to college yet"" is such the better choice.

People always like to throw around surgeons and investment bankers as great choices... which for a CERTAIN SUBSET of people that is true... it's just that random run of the mill 17 year old is UNLIKELY to belong to that subset.

It's like saying, ""Hey want to FI?  You should be a professional football player or CEO of a fortune 500 company and not blow all your money.""

I'll get RIGHT ON THAT.",best major to study in college

41116,"I would seriously recommend this. It's easier to pick up (initially) than any of the others, and just far more fun. You can take it with you anywhere, everyone gets a huge kick out of it, and you'd be riding the high tide of the mid-to-late-00s ukulele resurgence. And best of all, of course, is that if you take it seriously, you can produce some absolutely amazing music. With the added bonus of people going ""wtfukulele?"" all the time.",best instrument to play

13771,"""The Double Helix"" is Watson's account of the discovery, and goes into their dealings with Franklin in a fair amount of detail.

14637,"I will warn you that Montgomery is a turn of the 20th century author, everything she writes is definitely closed-door, and she's very old-fashioned, but she was also pretty progressive for her time, so her books aren't horrifyingly misogynistic or anything. I grew up reading her and read everything she ever wrote (minus her private diaries, but literally all her novels and short stories) so I'm kind of biased. Anne of Green Gables is pretty much my fave fish-out-of-water comedy/coming of age story of all time.",best romantic novel
