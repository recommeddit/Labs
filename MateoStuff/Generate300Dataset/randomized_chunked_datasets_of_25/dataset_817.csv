58417,best cologne,And mood. People under a lot of stress have different BO than more relaxed ones. Inspiration and hard work... don't smell that great.

48370,best color to paint with,Benjamin Moore Decorator’s White - classy and modern white. Goes with everything in all types of sunlight or lack thereof
68169,best science fiction novel,"Ha! Exactly. It is pulpy and has some dodgy 50s styled scenes and dialogue, but it was pretty dark at times (that one event that is alluded to shocked me when I read it knowing the era the boom came from).

For all its flaws, this book is basically the prototype cyberpunk novel. Neuromancer put it all together and birthed the subgenre, but this book laid the blueprint for it. Imbedded technology, moral decline, and an complete social upheaval due to unchecked technological advancement are all here. I think I read years ago Gibson praising the importance of this often forgotten novel. 

When I am stuck in traffic or being herded at an airport I think of this novel and just wish I could simply transport myself to where I need to go."

68619,best science fiction novel,"Good list.  Very similar to my own,  if i were to make one.   I'd put The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch somewhere on there but add that it's not for everybody...but if you like *weird* it's critical that you read it."
