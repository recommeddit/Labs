73270,"Mint Mate is also an option, but I can't tell if it's modern or not. I used to put TWM on all my VNC desktops, so pretty much everything is both less clean and more modern to me. I don't really love desktops that try too hard to be clever, and they often eat CPU in a way that feels really unnecessary. Just put the stuff where I can get to it - no magic, no hidden interface so it looks like nothing is installed, etc. I haven't tried Cinnamon (wanted low overhead for VMs), is it similarly chill like Mate?",best Linux distro

Stay away from for-profits.

You should be good to go.  Apply for Berkeley, but don't count on it unless you have something to separate you from other applicants.  No, good grades and academics don't do it.  That said, if economics and CS are your interests, try to find a way to combine them.  Make a tool and put it online.  Do something you can demonstrate.  That is a good way to get a leg up with the EECs folks at Cal.",best college in california
