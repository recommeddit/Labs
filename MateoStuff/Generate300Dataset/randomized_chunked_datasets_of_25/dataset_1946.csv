66050,"Always getting caught on the needlessly absolute statements lol.

Elite schools cater to the socio-political elites, if for no other reason that for those institutions’ formative years and for most of the time since those are the only people who could realistically attend. It’s ingrained. These people tend to be “conservative” (in the “lower taxes for the wealthy, get government contracts for my family’s industry” sort of way) out of self-interest. Harvard, the Ivy League in general, and similar schools produce these people out of both their culture and likely due to simple inertia.

Even highly respected schools with less entrenched history like UC Berkeley, UCLA, Michigan, Virginia, etc. aren’t quite at the same level of educating the political elite. Not sure how or if we should punish elite schools for this, but there’s a reason so many political elite attend or send their kids to Harvard or Yale.",best college in california
