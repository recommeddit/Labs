In any case, people have different tastes, and I understand it. Now, ""realism"" isn't what I'm looking for in an anime, and I think most people would agree with me. My characters don't look real and do all sorts of things that no normal person would ever do. I like it when a series tries to be realistic on some aspect and achieves it successfully, but being realistic isn't a big merit on itself, IMO.

That said, I didn't like the pacing and I felt that romance overshadowed what I thought was the strongest element in the series (i.e. comedy).

I went too far by saying it's ""pretty bad"", in fact, I gave it a 7 (although I probably should've given it a 6). It's still worth watching, but unlike the first one, it didn't have me laughing all the time, and the romance and drama weren't good enough to take the place comedy had taken in the first one. Partly because some of the comic-relief is really mood-breaking.",best anime

I'm looking for a lightweight laptop that I can take outside without having to worry about not being able to see the screen. I've found that the ones with a lower nit don't advertise the display brightness, so I would assume the ones that do are *decent* enough. I realistically just want to run VS/Code, and I prefer Windows so no M1 for me. I'm also trying to spend  < $1000",best laptop for general use

I get the design is good but the story is pretty bland and generic and it's a fiddly beast that takes ages to set up and play. Just doesn't seem like it would have such wide appeal",best board games

And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember'd;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.",best major to study in college

I clicked Cosmetic filtering off followed by uBO's Refresh button and got my icons back.

Going back the other way, I turned Cosmetic filtering back in and clicked uBO's Refresh button and the icons remained. I then hit F5 and they disappeared.
