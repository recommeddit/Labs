61739,"FFXV is a mixed bag to be honest. It gets alot of (understandable) hate but it's nowhere near the worst game ever. A few things I will tell you is that the combat is a mess and doesn't even reach the standard for an action game, and I'm not joking, the story basically doesn't exist, heavy bold on ""basically"", the large open world is mostly bare as hell, and even on a disc the game takes up OVER 60GB, almost as much as FFXIV which actually makes sense to eat up so much space as it's an MMO that constantly gets updated and has way way more to do than XV does.

I enjoyed the game while I was playing through it (the story and chapter 13 pre-fix aside), but I can't bring myself to touch the game ever again. Redownloaded it twice within a week and just deleted it both times. The combat, especially for an action game, just makes it unbearable to go back to alone, which is all there is to go back to really.
