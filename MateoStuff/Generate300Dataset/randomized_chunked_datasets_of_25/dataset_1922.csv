17895,best Kardashian,"~~I’m~~ In Kendall’s defense I don’t think she promotes it as a big part of her personality, I think (?) she was asked about it on a talk show and basically was like yeah I’m a stoner."
6138,best Netflix documentary,I’ll check it out. Thank you!
49583,best gaming monitor,A good gaming monitor in my country costs as much as a GPU. I'm fine with my peasant 75hz IPS monitor.
32708,best vacation resort,Thank you so much.
21034,best workout music,"Thanks, I will definitely listen into those :)"
70221,best major to study in college,Aviation all those guys are making tons of money as pilots out of school (well at least pre pandemic  they were)
11349,best gifts for dad,"Dude I don't know about you, but my cat bats a solid .350+ whenever I try to slide something sly by him."
28098,best breakfast foods,"Donuts right now. Well, because I’m fasting. Or better yet, whatever this guy is making on the food network right now."
64891,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Its bland as hell
17812,best Kardashian,"Idk, i like Kourtney the most
I feel like even tho Khloe helps people to loose weight and helped that homeless guy,she seems really evil, next to her Kim then Kendall,then Kylie
But in general, its all fault of their mother,i dont like how they awarded Kaitlyn for being trans when she didnt live not even half of her life as such...
I dont like how they seem to spoil their kids, how they want mixed children, how they profit off black culture & they kinda lie to people to earn money and scam real workers who deserve way more money
Also lying about plastic surgeries
Ofc no one is perfect and its our fault that we give them attention, no one deserves to be homeless but again... yeah, ""a lot of people would do what they did, they used their chance"" but again, it just pisses me off a lot"
43263,best detective show,It’s less a western than a cop show in a western setting. Modern day. It’s a western much in the same way as Wind River with Jeremy Renner is a Western
21859,best winnie the pooh comic,"Very MeatCanyon, good work!"
6766,best iPhone,"X

Felt like 10 years worth of research and trial and error to get that device into customers hands. 

Sounds insanely fanboy like, but even with an 11 Pro Max, I regard then X as my favourite."
61344,Best RPG game on PS4,"Divinity Original Sin 2, it’s a turn based table top game which I usually don’t care for but this game is basically the pinnacle it’s phenomenal.

Multiple characters with their own story, your decisions have good or bad consequences.

The combat is phenomenal with the strategy elements
Ex: if there’s water on the ground and fire hits it, you get mist to blind your enemies or if you hit water with electricity any enemies standing in the water get zapped.

The story is phenomenal, it’s not one massive open world there’s about 3 big maps, they may look deceivingly small at first glance but they are massive with caves, dungeons, inter connecting areas.  It’s phenomenal"
37616,best Marvel movie,i thought black panther was solid but not the greatest
30908,best country to live in,One of these things are not like the others
42938,best detective show,"I just started Endeavour, and have been enjoying it so far. It’s about a detective in Oxford, a prequel to Inspector Morse. Mindhunter is wonderful. Criminal Minds is great is you want a long series to watch. If you’re looking for some comedy, Brooklyn 99 and The Good Place are both fantastic and always makes my mood brighter."
31858,best hotel to live in,"If your plan is to buy the passes, you are better staying at a hotel that offers them. You can save a lot of money. I’ve only stayed at the Royal Pacific and I very much enjoyed my stay."
25257,best spiderman actor,"I think every Peter Parker and Spider-Man actor so far has been perfect for their respective versions of the character.

Overall, so far, I think Tobey is the best Parker, Garfield the best Spidey, but Tom Holland is the best at bein' both and has the most potential to be the truly definitive version of the character as a whole.

So TobePete ≥ TomPete > GarPete, GarSpide ≥ TomSpide > TobeSpide."

16360,best sunglasses for fashion,"Pushed up 500% from what? Wholesale to retail? Vs comparable brands? Vs the cost materials and labor? 

I pay $100 for wayfarers, I'd love to see the comparable $20 sunglasses you're talking about 

I buy knockarounds brand for about $20 but the clarity of the lens sucks and they scratch easily, unlike luxotica brands"
933,best desk lamp,I want to but my Samsung monitor doesn't have the mount points for them. Was thinking about selling my current setup to get two Asus monitors that I could mount.
11550,best gifts for dad,"You and your sister should totally make him a new one this year.  That would be hilarious, and he would probably love it."
