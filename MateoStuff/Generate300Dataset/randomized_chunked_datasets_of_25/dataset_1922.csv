17812,"Idk, i like Kourtney the most
I feel like even tho Khloe helps people to loose weight and helped that homeless guy,she seems really evil, next to her Kim then Kendall,then Kylie
But in general, its all fault of their mother,i dont like how they awarded Kaitlyn for being trans when she didnt live not even half of her life as such...
I dont like how they seem to spoil their kids, how they want mixed children, how they profit off black culture & they kinda lie to people to earn money and scam real workers who deserve way more money
Also lying about plastic surgeries
Ofc no one is perfect and its our fault that we give them attention, no one deserves to be homeless but again... yeah, ""a lot of people would do what they did, they used their chance"" but again, it just pisses me off a lot",best Kardashian

61344,"Divinity Original Sin 2, it’s a turn based table top game which I usually don’t care for but this game is basically the pinnacle it’s phenomenal.

Multiple characters with their own story, your decisions have good or bad consequences.

The combat is phenomenal with the strategy elements
Ex: if there’s water on the ground and fire hits it, you get mist to blind your enemies or if you hit water with electricity any enemies standing in the water get zapped.

The story is phenomenal, it’s not one massive open world there’s about 3 big maps, they may look deceivingly small at first glance but they are massive with caves, dungeons, inter connecting areas.  It’s phenomenal",Best RPG game on PS4

Criminal Minds is great is you want a long series to watch.

25257,"I think every Peter Parker and Spider-Man actor so far has been perfect for their respective versions of the character.

Overall, so far, I think Tobey is the best Parker, Garfield the best Spidey, but Tom Holland is the best at bein' both and has the most potential to be the truly definitive version of the character as a whole.

So TobePete ≥ TomPete > GarPete, GarSpide ≥ TomSpide > TobeSpide.",best spiderman actor
