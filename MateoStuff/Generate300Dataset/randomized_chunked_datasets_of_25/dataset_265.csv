5699,"In that case, go for it. Definitely learn a framework. WordPress is popular, Drupal is what my dev team works with. Open source frameworks mean that you can just grab a module for the thing you wanna do, which makes everything go a lot faster.

You could just learn Ruby and Rails instead of PHP, which will probably be easy if you used to do java. It's not as specifically in demand but there's still a lot of sites running rails.

Django is cool but don't learn django.",best programming language for web development

73595,"The Surface Pro 2 charges at 42w, a Pixel 3xl charges at 18w but that power bank has a maximum output of 45watts.

So you won't have been getting max charging from both devices but enough to charge them even when under light use.

I'm not considering any under 60watts for myself because whilst my phone only requires 12w my laptop requires 95w.

It won't be too long before I get a new phone so chances are I'll need well over 100w to get maximum charge but about 60-80 to beat the light usage drain.",best battery bank

12755,"This is an extremely important thing to say. When I was young I adored my father. I wanted to do everything with him, and be just like him. One day in the car he told me ""In a few years you're not going to want to be seen around me. I know it's gonna happen but that's okay, I'll know you love me"". I was pretty much like, ""Thats never gonna happen dad"". Then I became a teenager and would come home and go in my room and shut my door and that was that.
Then right before I turned 16 my father was murdered. No special last words to him letting him know how much I cared.
Because he said what he said when I was younger, I have no regrets. He knew I loved him and I know he loved me.",best gifts for mom
