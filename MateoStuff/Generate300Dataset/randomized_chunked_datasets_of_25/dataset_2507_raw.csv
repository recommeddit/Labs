"I'm not saying you're lying, but that would be an extremely outlying salary, because that's a lot more than the average nurse makes. Do they work a lot of overtime, perhaps?"
"Gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick

For those who don't like it, eat a dick

But for those who with me, sing that shit

Cause it go a little something like this"
"I have been using it for over a year now. Those sites post TNT releases, they are safe."
why the fuck have i been reading about toothpaste for half an hour at 3 am?... good night reddit.
"TimeCrimes, Spanish film from 2007. Very twisty time travel tale."
"Edge is probably what you're looking for, but don't discount the latest version of Vivaldi. Great little browser with tons of features and they've done a fair bit of work on speeding it up."
Real fun begins in the second half. You missed that.
"Been using ranger forever. But I also install nnn. nnn is getting to a point, that I might drop ranger one day. nnn, just wasn't sold out to me yet. But, it's getting closer to that point."
"I'm really surprised at how much I like GG. For a network show, they get in so many fantastically sly bits of dialogue."
"My mother saw this ring once years ago - white, yellow and red Clogau gold oak leaves, wound round into a ring. Really tiny, detailed leaves, gorgeous. She couldn’t afford it at the time, saved up for it, and when she went back it had been discontinued. This was about 7 years ago. 

Last year she realised it was on sale again, and again couldn’t afford it herself. So me, my sister, and my brother-in-law clubbed together to get it for her. She shouted at us for spending so much on her, but she also cried like a baby and hasn’t taken it off since."
Do you have a picture?
I would go with asphalt 9. Really good for what it gives
Yea I just bought the 60hz version and a 2 monitor desk mount. I forgot about prime day.
Bamboo grows fast. Is it of high value as a wood source?
"I really agree about fiesta texas. IR is the most disappointed ive been on a coaster. the operations were horrible and the crowd was particularly rude (maybe I got unlucky). food was bad, and rides broke down constantly. it was pretty, but honestly I think its one of the least pretty SF parks ive been to. I think SFMM is the prettiest especially during golden hour"
"I mostly use Lowes, if you have their credit card you get 5% off at the register and they are closer to my house, although I drive by both on my way home from work.  If I'm working on a bigger project I'll compare both based on price and what fixtures/finishes I like more.  Most projects end up being a combination of both as well as a few other sources.  

I used to use Menards mostly but prices got higher, and service got terrible."
come back google wave!
I’m really enjoying Random dice. It’s a tower defense game with PvP and PvE. Clans are coming within the next week too! Great time to start playing.
"Anything between 60-90% ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) works. It's the same as with isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol). Rubbing alcohol is also sold at 99% but this doesn't work, the minimum 10% water is needed to denature the proteins and kill the germs. This is why typical booze doesn't work as a sanitizer. 80 proof vodka is only 40% ethyl alcohol."
nordVPN has specialty servers for P2P.
How'd you get Cydia and Sileo installed at the same time?
"The only people I know who were disappointed by POI ore people who gave up in the first season, before it hit its stride.  Season 1 is a little ""procedural"", but in season two they start heading in to the big story and it becomes a thing of beauty.

Not saying there aren't people that don't like it, just saying I don't know any of them."
"Yeah, I really do adore all the first half when it’s just about how much Steve wants to serve, but once he starts and the movie goes full camp I think it’s just some of Marvel’s worst stuff"
I've been playing slot of the dirt series games and it's fun as hell. Dirt 2/3. And then there's grid is more arcade but the grid series is slamming. But yeah I own all the games he posted and there fun as hell but I'm def a dirt and project card driver.
What monitor would you be looking at now if you were to get one?
