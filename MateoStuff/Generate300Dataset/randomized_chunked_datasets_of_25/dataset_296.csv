35124,best NFL player,When I was growing up it was all about Peyton Manning. I even begged my madre to buy those shitty Wheaties re-releases because he was on the cover.
65842,best college in california,Maybe we’ll see when they get closer.
15503,best tree for the garden,Hahaha.  Good idea...though possibly expensive.
14698,best romantic novel,"Rebecca, by Daphne DuMarier. (I'm on my phone, can't check the spelling.) It's a mystery tinged with romance. Very suspenseful. A great read."
62482,Best RPG game on PS4,God of War isn't an RPG. Horizon barely is either.
34444,best NFL player,"And the Patriots get around the salary cap by having players paid less than they would elsewhere.  Let's not pretend that the NFC of the 80's was weaker than the AFC of the 2000's, so the parity argument is a very thin one."

6590,best Netflix documentary,"The Keepers

Wild Wild Country

Icarus

And if you have HBO Now watched Tickled. That shit gets bananas."
56408,best desktop monitor,"Do you have the 27 or 32 inch?

Yes the flickering was fixed by turning on VRR, but that also introduces judder to certain games so to me it’s more like a bandaid fix . . if you have no issues I’m happy for you tho! it is a great monitor, in terms of picture quality it is definitely the closest I’ve seen in a monitor when compared to CX"
6625,best iPhone,"“We’ve put in the next generation chip (A11->A12), upgraded the cameras, and put a longer-life battery in a X case.”"
32575,best vacation resort,"The locals are just like us. They are going to pick the very best jobs avalible to them. Just because it's a crappy, low paying job by your standards doesn't mean it isn't a job they are happy with.

And at the end of the day, the quality of life of the people who live and work there has nothing to do with whether or not LightningReptar chooses to vacation there or not."
54767,best water filter,"Second the Pur water pitcher. We have gross city water (chlorinated to all hell) and the filter makes it taste so clean and fresh. It's nice to always have tasty cold water in the fridge. It tastes better than Brita, and cleaner too."
47833,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,Quick Graph has been pretty good for me when I’m not near a computer and I need to see roughly what something looks like.

32116,best hotel to live in,That was my dream hotel when I was little.
17842,best Kardashian,OP: who is your least fav?
32870,best free online grammar checker,"I like to use it as a tool. I don't (anymore) blindly follow the suggestions, but I use it as a challenge to my writing. Red sentences are usually convoluted in my experience. I try to have a mix of yellow and unhighlighted sentences to vary the structure, but don't fret too much over it in general. I usually do the purple simpler phrase suggestions, but not always. The blue adverbs and green passive voice are great, though. I check each of them to see if I actually want passive voice / if I can replace it with something better, and check if adverb / verb pairs can be replaced by a better verb or not. Once again, I don't try to get rid of them all, just use it to say ""Hey, is this doing what you want?"" and purposefully choosing how to write it rather than blindly going with my first instinct."
40235,best midrange CPU,"There are benchmark that are there to test CPU's and get a comparison of raw CPU performances such as cinebench.   


When it comes to games, you are using good hardware then test it at settings that would be expected such as high/ultra. If you are testing low end chips then pair it with a low end GPU and test it in games with that. When I look at CPU comparisons for games I want them to be realistic to what they are going to be used for."
