4766,"Where I live we have the 3rd option of Menards. It was around for decades before the other 2 and is still a great big box store. It's main difference is all bulk/large items are kept in the yard. So you pay for it and drive your vehicle back to load it up. This has 2 benefits. 1) you handle your items only once (not including unloading at your destination of course) 2) you can actually pay for items and pick them up when ever. I bought 70 bundles of shingles, 4 rolls of felt and some nails last weekend and l haven't picked them up yet and won't until it's time to do my roof. 

Plus where I live they are all within 3 blocks of each other. Kind of cool to have so many choices.",best home improvement store

We used to give a mix of Legend and Trusty level goods, but now we bounce around different styles based on how creative we want to get and what our finances are like that year.
