16107,"Well that’s because Bausch and Lomb was going under and the brand went to shit. Prior to the late 90s Ray Ban (called that because they ban rays) was a very reputable brand in the US and their sunglasses were premium. Shit happens, things change. And Luxottica, might be putting a huge mark up on their shades, but they sell and are well made. Luxottica also makes just about every eyewear our there.  So you can’t scape them. I don’t care about brand, but I will say that the optics in Luxottica’s Ray Bans are far better than those of your 20 dollar gas station shades. I buy my Ray Bans at a descent price point. I have two pairs of lite force (very light plastic) frames, one of them being folding Wayfarers, which I love. If you can find Ray Bans for a discount, they are worth it.",best sunglasses for fashion

The first nerd was stunned by his friend's sweet ride and asked, ""WOW! Where did you get such a nice bike?""

The second nerd replied, ""Well, yesterday I was walking home, minding my own business, when a beautiful woman rode up to me on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, 'Take what you want!'""

The second nerd nodded approvingly, ""Good choice. The clothes probably wouldn't have fit.""",best gifts for dad

32669,"Mexico has wonderful resorts, but I encourage anyone going there to choose one close to a town instead of going all-inclusive.  My wife and I honeymooned at one on Isla Mujeres that was within a few blocks of a street closed off to traffic that is lined with outdoor cafe's.  Great way to save money and you're not stuck with the resort food if it sucks or you don't want to overeat buffet style every day.  We go back every year now.  
We also go to one along the Riviera Maya for the luxury treatment where we're waited on hand and foot, but we still go out to catch a cheap bus to Playa del Carmen for cafe's and entertainment.",best vacation resort

58923,"They do smell similar however they are different animals. 
Lira is a sophisticated lady with a much deeper amber profile, her first blush is citrus and lemony with a hint of cinnamon and licorice , there is some lavender in there but it’s barely detectable and it just adds a minor clean floral note....her finish is caramel toffee on shortbread with a deep amber undertone. 

Unknown Pleasures has a sharp and bright citrus opening which quickly fades to buttered biscuits and caramel. The tonka bean in Unknown Pleasures gives that familiar well-rounded smooth Gourmand note the way it feels to eat a velvety bite of creme brûlée. There is just ever so slight hint of  Earl Grey tea but think of it as a tea served with warm milk and honey it almost is lactonic in a way. Overall unknown Pleasures is more of an obvious in your face scent where Lira is a bit more sophisticated and floral and of course amber. While they are very similar they are also incredibly different and as for someone who collects citrus gourmands I cannot live without both.",best perfume
