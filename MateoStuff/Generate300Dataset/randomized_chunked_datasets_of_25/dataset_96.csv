72867,best Linux distro,"Which version would you say is most secure and safe? Also, which has the most devs and is most constantly updated?"
73087,best Linux distro,To be honest most Distros I've used Steam worked right out of the box.
23231,best social networking site for CS,"Sounds to me like someone can’t admit developers are willingly supporting the creation of tools used for nefarious purposes. How many whistleblowers do you need, how many elections have to be interfered with by foreign money, and how many bad faith arguments do tech CEO’s need to peddle on Capitol Hill before you realize how destructive social media is without people actively policing it?


You’re supporting the idea of developers being Adolf Eichmann’s. “I was just doing my job.” Think about how pathetic that abdication of responsibility is."

6702,best iPhone,I loved my iPhone SE original too but finally had to bite the bullet and upgrade earlier this year. I went with the iPhone 12 mini which was the closest form factor without the silly curved screen like the second SE and other models had which I disliked. Couldn’t be happier my choice and the size was close enough to not be annoying. Price was only only sticking point but I reasoned if it lasts as long as my last iPhone it would be worth it. Time will tell if I made the right call I guess.

34868,best NFL player,Well I’d say this year has been really well done. 2019 was a fuckin circus and 2020 was much improved. This is the best it’s ever been I think.

57300,best water brand,"Nestlé water actually tastes pretty good, but how it was obtained makes me not want it. Dasani and Aquafina are straight garbage though."
61345,Best RPG game on PS4,"I agree with this recommended, as a long time fan of the genre, it’s the best RPG game I’ve played in years. It scratched a big itch too, because there haven’t been any true RPGs released in a long time, we’ve been getting a lot of action RPGs instead and those just aren’t the same for me."
