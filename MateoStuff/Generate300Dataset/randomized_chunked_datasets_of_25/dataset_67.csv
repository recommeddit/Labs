22086,best celebrity,Zac Efron. When I met him I was a teenager and I hated him for no reason. Mostly jealousy. I was a total dick to him expecting him to also be a dick but actually he was the coolest dude ever. He was a total gentleman. He fucking called me sir and I was younger than him. He made me feel like a total asshole and I was. Ever since then I feel like I was moved by that. I try to think twice about how celebrities are. I didn't know how to be after our interaction. But ever since then Ive just been happy to hear about his success.

Also they are bright red and the only charging cables that I never had to search for long."
