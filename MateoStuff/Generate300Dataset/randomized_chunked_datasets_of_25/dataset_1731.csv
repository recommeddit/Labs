8121,best toothpaste,"I got one of their models that is like.. $110 or $120 for $70. I have amazon prime so I got a better deal, plus free shipping, and when I went to buy it there was an extra $10 instant electronic coupon. My teeth feel so awesome and clean now!"
17474,best iOS game,Thank you for making it.
39616,best podcast for biologists,"I LOVE both the Adaptors and Origin Stories. Both are very high quality podcast and have interesting subjects. 

You might also like A Scientist Walk Into A Bar. It's all on the name."
60444,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I noticed in an episode we watched last night that, when she got upset, her accent slipped. Itâ€™s a such perfect choice, to show that Moira doesnâ€™t really talk that way, itâ€™s on purpose."
73047,best Linux distro,Anything that makes it into the stable portage tree has been extensively tested.
65371,best phone service company,Really depends on where you are living and if you travel a lot. There is a reason Verizon has the most customers though. I have had every carrier here in Texas and Verizon is the best closely followed by att. Tmobile is very spotty and building penetration by t-mobile is very bad. Really you need to ask co workers and friends. I bet most will say verizon.

10757,best suitcase lock,"War crimes are one thing, but going biblical on them and the surroundings might be a step too far.

45883,best trick or treating candy,Any mini chocolate candy bar.
73484,best battery bank,"Anker 20k PD was the one I was referencing. Couple months ago I dove down the rabbit hole of fast charging power banks when u/Happypnt posted about a 10k 30W PD bank and I wanted to see what else is out there with the goal to reduce time spent in town charging.

The Huawei one is intriguing but still not out yet to my knowledge, but should be any day now. Can charge 12k mAh allegedly in something like 2 hours 15 minutes. But comes in at like 8.8oz per website specs. Not to mention it's also like 130 bucks and you'd have to also buy a 40W PD charger that's gotta weigh at least 2.1 oz and a c to c cable that is rated to take the charge."

31757,best hotel to live in,"Yes!! The small things do get on your nerves... or at least get noticed.  I can tell you exactly which pillows are better, which door knob is loose, and which shower head is better compared with the rooms I've stayed in.  It's surprising."
34761,best NFL player,"Given the time frame that the moon landings happened, they were more impressive than the Tesla roadster space launch, but something happening before another doesn't always make it more impressive. I think that what Brady has done in his 16 years starting is more impressive than Montana's career, especially now that the NFL is designed to not let teams have a sustained success for a long period of time"
