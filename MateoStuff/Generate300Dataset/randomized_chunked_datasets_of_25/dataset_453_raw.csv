"Exactly. Toilet paper for cheap candy? They could just choose not to give out shit.

Plus everyone and their mama is giving out the fun sized snicker bars and skittles, I like some variety in my candy, I will gladly take the other stuff."

"That's only from 1970 onwards, not over all of football history."

"9/10 action movies (based on IMDB's genre classification)

* Oldboy (2003)

* Princess Mononoke

* Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon

* RoboCop (1987)

* The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

* Jurassic Park

* Blade Runner

* Ghostin the Shell

* Raiders of the Lost Ark

I probably wouldn't say Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell or Oldboy are action movies but like I said I used IMDB's classification to make this easier to me. I don't want to get into the whole what is an action movie and what's not debate."
"HOW COULD I FORGET THIS? Turing's [Intelligent Machinery](http://www.alanturing.net/intelligent_machinery/) is super badass and also proposes neural networks, genetic algorithms and swarm intelligence *way before* anyone else."

"Having tried many distributions over the years, Manjaro is the first distro that I could honestly say is worthy of daily, primary use. It’s super stable and performative with coding, gaming, music production (Reaper, Bitwig). It’s beautifully customisable. The only thing I wish it had is Mac OS hotkeys as I’m so accustomed to Mac shortcuts. I understand this is a Linux issue and not specifically Manjaro."
Some are bitter. Some taste like coffee and chocolate. Guiness is the bitter type.
"This answer also applies to OSX fwiw (haven't tried it on Linux, but maybe there too)"
"It's not irrelevant, it demonstrates that your two statements are not mutually exclusive. They provided an example of another type of exertion that indeed depletes energy _in the short term_, yet grows in the long term with practice. It makes perfect sense to me that willpower would be similar.

To clarify, are you saying that it's not depleted in the short term at all?"
