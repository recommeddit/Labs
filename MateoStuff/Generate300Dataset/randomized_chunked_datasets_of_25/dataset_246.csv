61349,"Normally I’m not into playing early access versions, but I think I might do this just so that I can get a good feel for the classes and combat in the first section of the game, before committing to a character for a full play through. 

In D:OS2, for example, I definitely made some sub-optimal choices for my character build before I had gotten the hang of everything, but I didn’t want to go back and redo Fort Joy when I still had the whole game ahead of me.",Best RPG game on PS4
61279,"Because this thread is all the usual suspects:


**Battle Chasers Nightwar** and **Cosmic Star Heroine** are two awesome RPGs that use a similar battle system. It relies on combining attacks between your characters across multiple turns. They also have a cool system where you have to plan ahead which attacks you use because they become temporarily unavailable. Cosmic Star’s systems is particularly satisfying to experiment with.

**Deagon’s Dogma Dark Arisen** is the best action RPG on the PS4, hands down. It has combat the Witcher can only dream of, and a dungeon full of towering monsters with wild battle mechanics that makes the Monster Hunter grind look tedious. Add in a fantastic Pawn system that provides varied companion options built by the community and it’s something rather special, even if it is a remaster.


**Mutant Year Zero** is an X-Com style tactical RPG that has great presentation and some enjoyable battles. It’s not super long, but I enjoyed the time I spent with it and it’s not a full priced title.

**Earthlock** is a throwback to PS2 era JRPGs with western sensibilities. It’s not incredibly original, but the combat system is enjoyable and the stances make for some interesting mechanics. You can get it relatively cheaply and it’s competent enough to be worth your time. Cheery art direction.",Best RPG game on PS4
