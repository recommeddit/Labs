If your taking notes outta the equation then percussion is straight forward and just requires some rhythm training (which is pretty instinctual anyway and with experience on other instruments you would have developed some good internal rhythms). 

If its learning theory and visualizing what your playing then piano is golden with its straightforward layout and easy feel on the fingers. Getting into advance piano playing is a whole other thing from playing the basics though and sight reading can be harder as your reading 2 clefs instead of one. 

Then there is the feel of an instrument. I grew up playing guitar as my first instrument so connecting with the feel of strings is more natural for me then playing a woodwind. 

Guitar is poorly laid out and isnt ideal for theoretical development, it's all technique which takes years to develop (especially when you want to learn more then your typical cover band rock). Jazz chords take alot longer to learn on guitar then piano. 

Classical strings dont have any note indicators or frets which leads to the problem you mentioned above. The layout of these instruments is much friendlier though. 

Woodwinds and brass take alot of breath and mouth/breathing techniques which all take alot of time to master. 

If you stick to actual wooden flutes then it's not too challenging as they are limited to one scale/key, but you still need the breathing technique and your stuck to 1 scale per flute. 

Harps are very light to play. The strings are tuned to a scale which keeps everything diatonic (unless you tune them otherwise) and are very delicate on the fingers (unlike guitars) but they are very expensive instruments $$$ 


My dream instrument is to get a good cello one day as I find the tone and frequencies balance my body out and relieve stress instantly. 

I wouldn't go for what's easiest, I would be looking for which one you are happy to invest the most time playing since they will all take a good amount of time to learn. 

If your at the point where you know the note positions on a cello board, you have come a pretty substantial way and can improve on this much more rapidly now. But if the interest in this instrument is passing, then you can always get a few extra and diversify

37165,"Disney: go here if you love Disney or have kids. If you aren’t a Disney freak (or Star Wars fan?) I’d probably avoid it tbh. 

Universal: compared to other Universal parks in the world, this one is incredibly small and only has one coaster (Mummy).  

Six Flags: go here if you love coasters; this along with Cedar Point are considered the two Coaster Meccas. Not the cleanest park, landscaping is trash, and food is terrible. Quantity>quality

Knotts Berry Farm: go here if you enjoy amusement parks overall. The coasters aren’t as insane as Six Flags, but my favorite coaster in all of California is Ghostrider (I’ve ridden them all). Also has amazing atmosphere, food, and treats.  Quality>quantity 

Sea World: they are focusing more on coasters ever since Blackfish, but I wouldn’t go here unless you are going to stay in San Diego for a few days... there’s better stuff to do in SD than SW imo. 

Other tips: get the flash pass/skip the line/whatever they call it in that particular park. Also arrive 30-60 minutes before the gates open.",best amusement park

I was introduce to this technique by a baggage handler and it made me realized how futile locks are...

If you want to protect your stuff theft while travelling you should consider a [pelican case] (http://www.pelican-case.com/pelican-cases-for-travel.html). They are bulky but it s the only way to be sure.

Handles that just fine and has plenty of cores. 3950X has 4 more cores for 2x what I paid (700 vs 350, plus an additional 20$ savings when I purchase a qualifying MOBO).",best midrange CPU
