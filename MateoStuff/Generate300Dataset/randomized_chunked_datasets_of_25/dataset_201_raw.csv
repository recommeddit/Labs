"I'd like an ox. One of those for people who need one, I get a picture of some happy fucker with an ox, and the knowledge that my kid cares.

Edit: Since this post I spoke to my inlaws, and we all agreed to give animals for Christmas this year. A bunch of families are happy for widely different reasons. No more Christmas shopping vs yay livestock!"
"Fuck man, I live near there."
"Used to be my go to until I had to get off caffeine. Did caffeine-free Coke for a while, but it wasn't the same. Tried some other mixers. They're all ok. Finally tried cream soda on a whim. Holy hell, it's amazing. Might not be for everyone, but definitely worth a try."
"Honestly, Django might be your best shot. It will also be good for your career later on as you already know Python.

Here are two alternative ideas:

* See [Plone](https://plone.org/) which is a Python CMS. I played with it several times, but I'm not sure if it would be suitable for a social network. Especially if you want to choose a good platform and not rebuild the whole thing later.

* See [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/). It's a PHP CMS. It's not a silver bullet and it's not easy. However if the way it does things resonates with you, it can be a viable solution. You would need version 7. Modules are free in 99% of the cases, and there are some amazing ones that let you really work with your data/users without coding.

Like other commenters mentioned, use something other than Dreamweaver. Sublime, Atom, Vim or an IDE. They are better than DW on any level, including HTML/CSS.

Hope this helps."
Zen to Done by Leo Babauta is also a great & concise revision of Getting Things Done

"If you like a social experience, maybe consider a long-term stay in a private room at a hostel. If you enjoy that vibe, it could be the best of both worlds."
"The game that got me most into racing was gran turismo 5, it had this series of racing tests on nurburgring that had accompanying videos that explained the history, challenge, and legends of each quarter of the the track. 

The time you had to beat was brutal and so you were forced to learn a number of advanced techniques just to get bronze."

"Non-Accredited Majors.

Even if it sounds like a good degree, Mechanical Engineering for example.  It might not be accredited meaning it doesn't hold anywhere near the value.

Edit:  I only used Mechanical Engineering as an example.  This is normallt an issue with university programs that are new which means their program normally wouldn't have accreditation (it is in application process).  It is quite the gamble when you are a new student because if they do not get accreditation by the time you graduate you are SOL."
"The Deed of Paksennarion trilogy by Elizabeth Moon.  One of my absoloute favourites.

(I'd give a better write up, but I'm just killing time in my phone while waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom.)

Edit:  Ok, seems like they're going to be a while.  Sooooo...

It is a trilogy about a young woman becoming a paladin.  Moon was a marine, so her work is often heavy on the military side of things.  This trilogy is classic heroic fantasy.  Moon has a very straight forward narrative style that I particularly enjoy.  She keeps the story going.

"JavaScript is a must (knowing a framework helps, such as Angular, React, or Vue), HTML and CSS you can get by with minimal knowledge (although it would greatly benefit to understand it well), and then pick a backend language and framework (Python with Django, Ruby with Rails, PHP with Laravel, Node with Express, C# with .Net Core or MVC5, Java with Spring). The BE language doesn't really matter, but I would try to focus on one that has a lot of jobs in the city you want to live in (PHP and C# are the main ones where I live). 

If you want to gradually move your way up learn HTML and CSS, build some static stufff and then learn the basics of JavaScript and dom manipulation/event listeners. This is enough to probably get you a junior front end position where you can hone you skills and learn about things such as Grunt/Gulp, ES6/Typescript, and a framework. 

From there, if you are interested in backend, you could start with a CMS and build custom templates for them (such as Wordpress), but don't expect a full time gig as a BE dev unless you have a solid understanding of OOP, APIs, and MVC patterns. This will probably take about 6 months to a year to learn in order to be what I would consider hireable (there are obviously exceptions)."

"A relevant advantage of Fedora is that it has a focus on developer's tools. A couple of ""yum groupinstall ..."" will bring up a programming environment for the popular enterprise languages.

Having said that, the GNOME3 user interface is a long way from Windows and Ubuntu's always-present menu is a great help for beginners.

Starting with a VM is a good idea, but getting rid of the VM and installing on the bare metal is when the real learning starts."
