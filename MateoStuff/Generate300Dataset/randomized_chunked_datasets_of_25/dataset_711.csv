68926,best science fiction novel,"It's also perhaps worth noting that the author of this list is [a regular contributor to Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/author/andrew-liptak/) (publisher of 3 of the titles recommended in the main list in that article, plus another 2 if you include the parent/sibling Tor Books line), and [has a non-fiction book about cosplay coming out from Saga Press this year](https://www.andrewliptak.com/blog/cosplay-book-saga-press-science-fiction-star-wars-costuming-announcement) (publisher of 3 of the books in the main list).

This isn't intended as a Puppyish or GG-esque ""ethics in book recommendations"" conspiracy theory; rather, I think it's fair to say that we all have our own bubbles and interests, and both Tor.com and Saga Press are pretty progressive (or whatever term you prefer) - the senior editor of Tor.com was reported [in an interview](https://sffdirect.com/report-science-fiction-convention-ytterbium-eastercon-2019#fifth) as saying ""Tor.com Publishing is pretty left wing anyway.""

*(EDIT 'cos Reddit crapped out on me before I finished)* As such, the make-up of the list isn't that surprising, in the same way you'd expect a set of recommendations from, say [an academic who's also an SF writer, writing in a left-ish British newspaper](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/28/best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-books-of-2020) to come up with a fairly different list based on their biases/interests/cultural background."

25287,best spiderman actor,"Holland's Spider-Man doesn't really feel like Spider-Man to me. He feels like an entirely different character. Not necessarily a bad thing because the MCU is vastly different to the main universe, but he just doesn't feel like Spider-Man to me."
