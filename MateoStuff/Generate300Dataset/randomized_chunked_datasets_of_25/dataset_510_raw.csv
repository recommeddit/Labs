"Try pistachio with cardamom, I've had it at an Afghan restaurant and it instantly changed my favourite flavour of icecream from just pistachio to pistachio and cardamom because of the added richness and depth of flavour."
"They actually just relaunched a Cannoli flavor, but I believe it's different from Holy Cannoli."
Stuck up articles always forget the pimpin hoes degree.
"The war is seen as America very much being the aggressor.  At the time Senator Abraham Lincoln called out James K Polk for having soldiers cross the border and intentionally getting Mexican soldiers to fire on them to start a conflict.  Known as the [Spot Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_Resolutions).  The entire war and it's battles weren't discussed much besides the capture of Mexico City.  The war is also seen as a precursor event to the Civil War as a lot of soldiers and military leaders get experience from this was that helps them in the Civil War. Plus slavery and conquest comes up, northern states and southern states didn't want to take over much of Mexican due to one racism and two cause no one wanted any more states that allowed or disallowed slavery."
Just opened where pizza guru used to be on upper State. Roman style pizza. Legit.

"The fact that `response` is sometimes a string and sometimes an object (depending on what the server happens to send back) made me lose interest in axios in my first couple of days using it. Why would anybody think that's a good idea?

I'd probably consider Cloud 2 wireless if you want wireless headsets as that's pretty much the best there is."
"To be fair, everything has been linked to cancer. Especially in the state of California."
"BMJ ran this fabulous little work of satire a few years ago: http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7429/1459.abstract.

It's a literature review of the efficacy of parachutes and ends with a recommendation for randomized control trials or something fantastically short-sighted. The paper is structurally and methodologically solid. And it's a great warning against losing perspective while slavishly devoting oneself to format."
"I mean he seems like a good wing-man at a bar, but a one-on-one beer might be a little weird and intense."
New Girl is surprisingly funny. Good ole Schmidt.
I read that initially as 'floss your asshole'...
"I'm a bit surprised at its low (i.e. lower than BGG average) ranking here too. It's my only 10 (I recently promoted it from 9 seeing as my friends and I spent a whole lunchtime talking about its meta and having a great time), and I'm definitely not bored after 20-ish games roughly evenly spread across the base and first expansion factions.

My guess is that its complex inter-faction interactions put people off, since it takes a few games for it to really click. I would definitely put it closer to 2019 Dune's 3.8 rating because of this emergent weight."
I know right? He did post something on Twitter a while back though. I havenâ€™t checked his twitter in a while so Iâ€™m not sure if heâ€™s still alive or not.
People still read that
Hahah all I could think of was Jake Peralta.
"The Daily Mail is very bad. [Heres a song about it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eBT6OSr1TI), it sums it up pretty well

They also try to scare the population with total bullshit. [Heres another song about that](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZTeSxWdk1g)"
