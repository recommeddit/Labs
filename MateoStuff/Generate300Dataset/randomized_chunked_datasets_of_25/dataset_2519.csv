25813,best cricket teams of all time,I agree with your quality of opposition argument comparison between 80s and 00s. Jus a correction that Pakistan were whitewashed down under in 1999 and not 2000.

73881,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Just gonna chime in here since nobody else mentioned it, but I've been using the [MagGlass](https://www.amazon.com/MagGlass-Tempered-Glass-Screen-Protector/dp/B07QB4JJV6/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=magglass+ipad+11&qid=1619187726&sr=8-4) screen protector for the last 6 months or so and I find it to be the best matte option for my use case. It's a bit hard to explain but color contrast is almost boosted because of the lack of reflections, and the 'grain' of the matte coating is fairly minimal compared to what I've seen with other screen protectors unless you have your face right up against the display. 

&#x200B;

I suppose the primary standout feature is that it's made of tempered glass, which I obviously prefer because of the added layer of protection. However, since it's made of glass the drawing experience is still pretty mediocre; if the bare screen has a 1/10 resistance rating I'd rate the protector maybe 3/10. Which is to say it helps, but not that much. So far I also have little to no wear on my pen tip. Edges are a little sharp but it doesn't bother me much since it's pretty much a full-coverage screen protector.

&#x200B;

Figure I'd also mention that even though it picks up fingerprints easier than a regular glossy screen protector, I've had a much better experience with this one when compared to other plastic/ PET films, which tended to get gross pretty quickly. 6 months in and I don't even have a scratch on this thing, nor do I have any quality degradation; unless I break it, I can see it staying on for the rest of my iPad's life.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps!"

639,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"This guy is a tool. He himself will use ProtonVPN but then say HMA and Norton VPN is ""basically the same"" as that and will argue with you unecessarily. He pretends no logs VPNs that are reputed with experienced downloaders are somehow the same as HMA because ""you cant verify"" if they dont log. HMA says they log! But dont waste your breath with this guy, he will keep arguing with you and creating disinfo. Nobody recommending VPNs to new users here say that VPNs are a 1 stop solution or you should trust them explictly, and recommend doing due dilligence before making any yearly commitments."
