19447,best YouTube video,"Just wanted to point out that Bill Wurtz is still alive in kicking. He’s currently learning new computer graphics stuff and is working on new songs. If you go to his website he is answering questions every day, honestly pretty funny."

21127,best workout music,"I fucking love Destrage, so happy to finally see them getting some recognition, after their first two albums pretty much just flew under the radar for most of the metal world. I strongly suggest checking out their two old albums as well, both are excellent."
19049,best YouTube video,"If you don't mind a darker sense of humor, Michael Reeves."
12862,best gifts for mom,"No, I want money. Karma doesn't pay the bills."
18118,best Kardashian,Khloe was drunk and was caught off guard because Snooki randomly showed up to her anniversary party at her house without a personal invite. I would be weirded too if a stranger showed up to my house uninvited. Plus multiple people who met Khloe in real life said she was really nice to them.
67097,best places to skydive in california,If you want to have a nice day trip you could also get out of the bay. I've done [Skydive Lake Tahoe](https://www.skydivelaketahoe.com/) and [Skydive Sacramento](https://skydivesac.com/) which were both good. The Tahoe jump had spectacular views.

49131,best gaming monitor,"I own the Omen X 27 and I am really happy with it. It’s a 1440p 240hz TN-pannel monitor (compared to other TN monitors, this pannel looks very good in my opinion after you set it to your liking: very vibrant, very contrasty, super fast). It’s Freesync 2 certified but also works with (mine) Nvidia (G-sync) graphics card.

I also had the LG but returned it because of the BLB and the its contrast and some dead pixels."
59303,best perfume,Her name is Caitlin Stasey! Most famous for her role in Neighbours but went on to do a few movies which I don’t think were that popular
11759,best gifts for dad,This guy is the rightest. I either take my dad to see a movie or go fishing or something. I can tell he appreciates it more than some lame gift. Its raining this weekend so I'm going to take a day off next week and rent kayaks and go fishing.

10432,best suitcase lock,"Pro safety tip: When fucking Africa, use protection."
68435,best science fiction novel,"Read the first, its weirdness intrigued me. Kept going because I had heard so much bullshit about how great of a series it was.  Would have burned the books when I got to the end of the series if I had read paperbacks. I am still disappointed I put myself thtough that."
66031,best college in california,"On a per capita basis? Yes. It's not enough.

30311,best Mexican war to study,It's pretty surprising how such a small state way back then when the population of the planet was so much smaller could muster these armies over and over again. Just how many people were sat around *not* pissing off the Carthaginians or the Greeks or the Gauls?
