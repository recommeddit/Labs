55113,best places to hike in the east coast,"Hey guys!

Super stoked about the feedback of this shot.

For those of you who may be interested, this was shot with a Fujifilm XT1 and a 16mm lens. Shot at f/14 at 1/60 and ISO 800 at 4:40pm. The sun was starting to set towards the right side so I cranked up the ISO a bit to improve the lighting a bit.

I'm a photographer based in Montreal. If you wanna check out any more of my shots you can find my [Instagram here](http://www.instagram.com/davelasto) and my [portfolio here](http://www.brandbig.co)!

20785,best workout music,Eye of the tiger!
38666,best newspapers to read,"Aye, I like to use it as a jumping off point. A story might catch my eye, which I can then go research it more detail."
23684,best car racing video game,"NFS Underground 1. No doubt about it.

The arcade car handling is perfect. The graphics are all shiny, neony and still look gorgeous today. Soundtrack kicks ass. Lots of customization options and you can actually make your car look good.

It's just a gorgeous and enjoyable arcade racer. Too bad that the entire genre died out. Not just the ""rice car"" theme, but the arcade racing games entirely. Everything has to be a simulator or a simcade nowadays."
12909,best gifts for mom,Something made with my kids' hand/footprints. Sentimental. A nice thank you for keeping them alive. I don't need anything that costs money. I just want to feel appreciated.
20530,best workout music,"You just named a lot of my favorite workout songs! Tech has the best (IMO) workout songs in hip hop right now

[Tech N9ne - the beast](http://youtu.be/5sab9V14tEU)"
9863,best portable charger,"Don't get this, it's cheap but the quality is crap. Anker is the move."
18298,best YouTube video,"[I'M AT SOUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAUnDDTz30k)

61380,Best RPG game on PS4,I have played Dark Souls 3 and my brother is playing Bloodborne right now and is sending me the disk after he finishes but thank you!
68905,best science fiction novel,"Seriously, it's hard to even find good reviews a lot of the time because many will spend longer talking about the author and their political / social opinions than the freaking book

I don't care if the Author is a genderfluid brony cosplaying as cat irl, or if they said there are only two genders. Flat out, don't care. I want to know if the book is good, you can completely hide every single thing about the real life author if you want, I flat out don't care

It's shocking how many people can't separate the creator and the creation, and judge an entire book based off the author irl"
52018,best iphone case,"No wobble at all when pressing the corners? If there’s only a little or none, this might be the case to get for me."
32107,best hotel to live in,"The [Tickle Pink Inn in Carmel Highlands](https://www.ticklepinkinn.com/).  

We stayed in the [Senator's Cottage](https://www.ticklepinkinn.com/senators-cottage-34.htm).  It had a tree growing up through the living room.  

Perched up overlooking the Big Sur coastline, the view was breathtaking."
68680,best science fiction novel,"If I didn't really dig the first Three Body Problem book, does that just mean I'm not as into it as so many seem to be, or does it get better after the first book?"
17320,best iOS game,Why was this reply so hostile my dude
34129,best NFL player,ಠ_ಠ
4618,best text editor,"If it's something small (one file, configuration files, etc), then vim or Sublime Text. If it's a larger project, I'll use VSCode. It has pretty good features out of the box (autocomplete, finding function definitions/usages), and as someone who generally uses git from the command line, I actually find myself using the git integration. It's also not too much of a memory hog and is generally pretty responsive. I used Sublime Text for a while, but it's kind of annoying because any kind of useful features you'd like from an IDE require 3rd party plugins, which can often break or slow down the editor."
24324,best anime,"How is Gintama 107?  
I seriously don't know."
44947,best items under $100,Which one do you recommend?
7192,best iPhone,"I thought the SE looked like tremendous value for money and will get great support, but I had to have a new phone and Apple kinda drug out the release so I have the 11 now.  

If you hold on to your phone and won't likely break it, I'd get something from the 11/SE group or wait for the new ones soonish. I don't like buying old tech that I know I'm going to use a lot and hold onto for a while. For me the iPhone window is 3 years. After that the battery starts to slide for how much I use a phone. If you got a deal on the 11 when the new ones drop that would still give you a good 4 years of updates."
72615,best keyboard switches,"Box Whites by far, they're light and crisp and just really satisfying for me to type on. Yes I've tried Jades and Navies but the Box White to me has a much better typing experience.

I think that might change soon though, I have Holy Pandas, 67g V2 Zealios, and some Aqua Zilents waiting to go in boards that aren't built yet, just trying them on a tester feels nice but I won't really know until I can try typing on them for a while"
66325,best soccer team in the world,"Dunno, I just think it's bigger club. They've got more european success, more legendary players and i think it's more attractive destination for footballers if they aren't in this sad state they're currently at."
40539,best midrange GPU,Or streaming with 2060.
51827,best iphone case,"I read in many places that’s a great alternative, but unfortunately it doesn’t cover the bottom of the phone... but which was a deal breaker for me. It would have otherwise been a great choice!"
