Super stoked about the feedback of this shot.

For those of you who may be interested, this was shot with a Fujifilm XT1 and a 16mm lens. Shot at f/14 at 1/60 and ISO 800 at 4:40pm. The sun was starting to set towards the right side so I cranked up the ISO a bit to improve the lighting a bit.

I'm a photographer based in Montreal. If you wanna check out any more of my shots you can find my [Instagram here](http://www.instagram.com/davelasto) and my [portfolio here](http://www.brandbig.co)!

The arcade car handling is perfect. The graphics are all shiny, neony and still look gorgeous today. Soundtrack kicks ass. Lots of customization options and you can actually make your car look good.

It's just a gorgeous and enjoyable arcade racer. Too bad that the entire genre died out. Not just the ""rice car"" theme, but the arcade racing games entirely. Everything has to be a simulator or a simcade nowadays.",best car racing video game

68905,"Seriously, it's hard to even find good reviews a lot of the time because many will spend longer talking about the author and their political / social opinions than the freaking book

I don't care if the Author is a genderfluid brony cosplaying as cat irl, or if they said there are only two genders. Flat out, don't care. I want to know if the book is good, you can completely hide every single thing about the real life author if you want, I flat out don't care

It's shocking how many people can't separate the creator and the creation, and judge an entire book based off the author irl",best science fiction novel

It has pretty good features out of the box (autocomplete, finding function definitions/usages), and as someone who generally uses git from the command line, I actually find myself using the git integration. It's also not too much of a memory hog and is generally pretty responsive. I used Sublime Text for a while, but it's kind of annoying because any kind of useful features you'd like from an IDE require 3rd party plugins, which can often break or slow down the editor.",best text editor

If you hold on to your phone and won't likely break it, I'd get something from the 11/SE group or wait for the new ones soonish. I don't like buying old tech that I know I'm going to use a lot and hold onto for a while. For me the iPhone window is 3 years. After that the battery starts to slide for how much I use a phone. If you got a deal on the 11 when the new ones drop that would still give you a good 4 years of updates.",best iPhone

I think that might change soon though, I have Holy Pandas, 67g V2 Zealios, and some Aqua Zilents waiting to go in boards that aren't built yet, just trying them on a tester feels nice but I won't really know until I can try typing on them for a while",best keyboard switches
