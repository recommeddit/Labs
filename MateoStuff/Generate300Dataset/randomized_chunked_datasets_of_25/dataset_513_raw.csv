I have the base game without the SGs and absolutely love it
"What is a class network? I tried to Google it, but just came up with a bunch of unrelated stuff.

Jane's and financial review are both new ones. Is financial review the Australian publication? And if so, is it relevant for international news as well or does it mainly focus on Australian? 

Thank you for the suggestions!"
"Awww, that's a great story.  I loved Pushing Daisies, btw.  They got screwed by the writer's strike."

"Just as a spectator, the most intimidating would have to be a full pipe organ, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mVSoikeA0o&list=PL85SeV5T5VK2mqym5fGwOc9qA8HswnzAd) at St. Ouen, where the organist is facing 5 manual keyboards, dozen of stops, and another keyboard for the feet. She has a couple of assistants for the registrations, page turnings etc.  A hugely responsible piece of work and a genuine tour de force."
"Not sure how accurate this is, but it's what my Marketing prof told us in class: When a toothpaste is recommended by ""4 out of 5 dentists,"" it doesn't mean that those 4 dentists prefer that toothpaste over all others. It simply means that in a situation in which you asked them ""Is this a good toothpaste?"", they wouldn't recommend **not** using it."

"Yes, noticed the same.

Amazon has recently been screwing up its search algorithms to prioritize higher margin products.  Easier to use an external search engine to find products on Amazon now."
I live and Dallas and there are no casinos here..
"In your situation, I would personally buy a second similar sized screen, and make it my new gaming screen. The Dell S2417DG is a similar size, with good color attributes for a TN panel.

2 reasons being: It's a similar size so will look good sitting next to each other on the desk, and you can retire your first monitor as a video/movie/twitch/reddit watching device for your downtime between matches.

If you're looking for a 1 for 1 swap of your current panel, then that choice is up to you how much it's worth.

I'll tell you that sitting on my desk I have: 1x 75hz, 1080p ultrawide, ips. 1x 60hz 1440p, ips. 1x 165hz, 1440p, tn panel, g-sync (the dell S2417DG).

Based on the fact of the budget you're probably looking at (since you're still rocking the gtx 580), I would say you wouldn't be disappointed with the D2716DG if that's the route you've been thinking of."

I have both! Étoile has a special place in my heart in the summer time. I’m glad to see some Fragonard love on here.
"I really like British author Jojo Moyes.  Me Before You is her most popular book, but she is fairly prolific.  A lot of her stories are told through flashback mingled with present day events and several of them are based on historical events.  I’ve read almost all of her books and have yet to be disappointed."
"I had trouble thinking of recent ones, but I agree with that"
"You make this investment sound like you are investing into a job rather than a hobby though.  This entirely depends on the person and what their goal is.  Personally speaking and for a friend of mine who both of us just enjoy quality products feel the need to not go to a lower quality (not saying c920 is shit, but if there's better, I prefer the better) when you have cash to burn.  I'm not out on twitch to grind and get the highest sub count, or viewership or follower.  I mutually invested into my stream to play with friends WHILE streaming just for the hell of it, and if people want to sub or help donate so be it.  It's more fun to see people come in and throw a prime at me every once in a while, twitch is like a mini-game of fun while playing a game.  And also it helped expand a network of friends by sharing my knowledge and helping others with their stream.  I get way too bored with real life shit, this is the best hobby I've picked up in a while.  Keeps me in doors and out of trouble too,  If it weren't for streaming I would be at the bar getting hammered every night and end up with some fucking STD or some shit."

"People think somebody with 100 subs should have the same setup as someone with 100,000 subs or they shouldn't even bother but that person is in no way filling the niche the other person is and are just talking out of their butt. I don't need a Ferrari to get to work when it's in walking distance."
"Avoid sugary drinks, they will make you feel sick and hungover. Hard Ciders are great, but aim for dry ones (with a lower sugar content), and avoid wine-based ciders (apple or pear is great).  A lot of ciders have added sugar—even the drier ones. If drinking liquor such as vodka, try to drink potato or corn based as opposed to grain or wheat based—the human body processes non grains easier and you will be less ill - feeling the next day.  Learn a little about wines to better decide which ones you like (more expensive does not equal better). Importantly, drink water between each alcoholic beverage.  Limit mixing types of alcohols to no more than 2 types in one night; eg, just beer and shots (but not wine also), or better yet, jus one type. Enjoy trying different types of drinks while you’re young, the older you get the less your body can tolerate, and you are less able to bounce back / feel less hungover the next day. 

(Watch your drinks carefully while they are being made and all throughout drinking them to avoid foreign substances put in them by scurrilous types wishing to take advantage of you. Have fun and be bold but beware you boundaries and inhibitions are lowered. Party
 with people to trust.)

"When Mark Hamill and David Prowse were on set, the line was ""Obi-Wan killed your father"".  Since it was dubbed over in post by James Earl Jones, Lucas was able to keep the real dialog very secret.  Something like only 6 people knew it beforehand.  So when Hamill and Prowse saw it in theater for the first time, they were as surprised as anybody.

In The Usual Suspects, the director had convinced Gabriel Byrne that his character was Kaiser Soze.  SO it came as quite a surprise to him when the movie comes out and it's Kevin Spacey instead."
"Similar concept, but use gin. Basically gin, lime, mint leaves, cucumber and ginger ale. Probably the finest cocktail I've ever had.

"Sure! Those three are honestly still great choices! If you don't want a ton of speed, but have to pick 3 artisans, I'd take those three. Only reason to go with Raiden or shidenkai is that if you really want to mess with a lot of speed. The hien is still quite fast, so if you want to explore some speed without going nuts, otsu v2, hien, and zero are all awesome!"
thats a bold move cotton.
