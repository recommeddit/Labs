68175,"Well I've only really gotten into reading the last couple of years, and I'm not the fastest of readers so it's not easy for me to come up with a top 5 list. I've read more than 5 sure, but some were just okay and not any I'd rank on a top list.

-Old Man's War series by John Scalzi. They're fun reads. Scalzi creates an interesting universe with sharp plot twists and even sharper solutions to the twists.

-Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M Miller Jr. I'm not usually big on post-apocalyptic settings, but this one is good. It's a good speculative look at humanity as to what events unfold after nuclear holocaust.

-The Forever War by Joe Haldeman. I was skeptical with the first few chapters, but it turned into a good read about a soldier's look at a long war and the effects of time dilation on not only the war itself, but the change in human culture.

-Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. My first cyberpunk book, and it was blended well between stuff going on in the real and digital worlds. Also an interesting display of what anarchy might look like.

-The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. This one I had to toss in because I haven't read as much at I'd like yet. It's certainly a good book and obviously a classic in sci-fi. But I also love that it's from so long ago and different look at how alien invasion might look before the atomic age. Also, I think there's something about writing styles from that era that I like because I love Jack London's writing as well, and I feel they're similar styles.

That being said, I see so many books repeated in other posts here that I either have (Dune, Hyperion) or will soon get (Foundation, or a few Reynolds' books) and I'm excited to get to them.",best science fiction novel

This set of pencils:  http://www.dickblick.com/products/faber-castell-art-on-the-go-drawing-set/

Just go down to your local art store and buy the ones you want individually.  I burn through the black brush tips pretty quickly so I usually buy them a few at a time.
