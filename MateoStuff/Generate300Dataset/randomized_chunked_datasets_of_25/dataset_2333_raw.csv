"Andrew Garfield for me but I REALLY do like Tom Holland as well. But they are playing him at different ages and in different circumstances so I think each did well with what they were given.

I hated Toby with a passion. Google tobyface on youtube."

I recommend MoneyDance."
"Yeah, best WordPress hosting Reddit threads generally blow. But, I also think you've missed a trick here too bro.

For anyone who isn‚Äôt aware, there are 3 types of WordPress hosting:

* **Managed hosting (also known as shared hosting) -** Siteground and Bluehost are both examples of managed hosting services. They provide you with WordPress tools and WordPress support, and they provide good WordPress hosting at a reasonable price. Some are better than others, but even the really expensive ones offer solid value. Plus, they do all the hard work for you.
* **Managed hosting but not WordPress -** Some companies will manage your server for you - but not if you‚Äôre using WordPress. If you have multiple sites, this is a good option BUT you‚Äôll need to take care of things like backups, caching etc yourself. 
* **Unmanaged hosting services -** This means everything is on you. It will save you a fair amount of cash in the long run, but it will require time, dedication and know-how. 

However, you‚Äôre not going to get any brownie points from anyone for making life harder for yourself, so unless you‚Äôre really into your servers and know your stuff, unmanaged hosting just isn‚Äôt worth the time. Don‚Äôt be a tight ass, spend a bit of cash and use a shared hosting server :)"
"I just wanna bring to the attention here that blue collar jobs have thriving markets and some very good pay and compensation.
I myself am a pipe fitter/welder for the union and I enjoy what I do. Every day seems to be different and every job presents new challenges, yea you may get dirty, beat, bruised and banged up if you use your ass to think instead of your head (I do quite often, dont you judge me). My pay is well above most of my buddies who have completed college degrees and im almost willing to bet anything that my job satisfaction is higher. 
Just saying, give it some thought too. I know the go to route is college for most but for those of us who enjoy looking back and knowing we built some intricate shit that helps run even more intricate shit it's a rewarding feeling. Plus... The money. Jesus, the money. 

Edit: I just wanna say thank you to everyone for the overwhelming responses. I recieved multiple people asking the same questions so I did try to answer to some on my general pay (not all, so many asked lol), how to get into this trade, my personal experiences, etc. 

I do really appreciate the gold too! Granted I have no idea what it does lol

Also I did receive a number of negative comments and I encourage people to please take a look at them as well, they did bring up valid points and I tried my best to refute some of the examples given. This isn't a life for everyone but damnit it's a good life to a lot of people.  Thanks guys."

16 for Watson feels pretty high to me.
RIP. :/
"Love this doc! Amazingly, I was able to see it in theaters and have re-watched it multiple times on Netflix."
I remember trying it a while back. It seemed like another one of those clash of clans reskins but in space. Should I try it again with a more open mind?
Not on Netflix.

Really good so far thanks!
"You should be comfortable leaving all calculators behind, because you will not be able to use them at all. The calculations do not test your ability to do basic operations on big/ugly numbers anymore, they test your ability to answer the question by understanding it.

Linear Algebra: easy, you will be dealing with numbers no bigger than probably the 12x12 multiplication table. Know vector functionalities, dot product, cross product, their meaning. Is easy class!

Calculus Multivariable: level sets, be able to visualize graphs helps a lot. Here you can use programs to help you draw functions in R^3 and higher."
"This might be true when comparing to apples official cases, since you pay a premium for the apple logo. But there is definitely a difference between a $5 case and a $20 when it comes to materials and protection."
"interesting, I'll have to watch some gameplay videos and look at reviews.

Edit:  Wow. I'm adding this to the list."
"Oh that sounds promising, no I haven‚Äôt. Thanks so much!"
"I already has been pointed out how bad everything Nestle is, but I don't think it has been pointed enough.

Fuck Nestle!"
American Optical are USAF issue and pretty good. Solid affordable shades.
"It's really good, try one of the molcajetes, or the Agaves burrito, or the Chiles Nortenos.

But my personal can't-miss-when-in-SB place to get mexican food is [Corazon Cocina](https://www.facebook.com/SBCorazonCocina/).  The tacos are absolutely incredible, I cannot recommend the Quesadilla de Mercado enough.  Check out a few of the pictures in that link and you'll probably be convinced to give it a try."
Fortaleza is one of my go to‚Äôs. However it‚Äôs Anejo for meüôåüèΩ
"Good point.  However, he said ""instrument"" not ""conglomeration of instruments."""
Yeah gsheets performance is ass. I only use it for small things.
"*The Man Who Killed Don Quixote* is certainly an offbeat choice, and it'll be in the US this spring. Don't believe all those early reviews. It had a [7 minute standing ovation at Cannes](https://youtu.be/vV4SZcAS5Xc) and it recently won [Best Foreign Film at Magritte](https://twitter.com/Alacran_Group/status/1091933551346548736)\* in Belgium.

&#x200B;

\* Correction: Best foreign film in coproduction  (i.e. a film with a Belgian coproducer)."
Fair enough. I guess since major companies stopped supporting IE11 we do the same for most of our projects as well. But you are right there are cases when we need that support but there are so many other libraries now days that would require polyfills that the fetch API won‚Äôt be your only problem at that point.
Fantastical. Hands down.
