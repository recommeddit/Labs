54565,"Hey!  I'm really looking for a pad that has a bit more speed than my Corsair MP510.  I've loved my Corsair but being that I have the XL desk version, I'm annoyed by how difficult it has become to clean.  The mousepad is a nuisance and has collected so many flecks of dust that negatively affect my gameplay.

&#x200B;

SO... I'm thinking of making the switch to Artisan, specifically the Hien XL Soft.  It's a bit speedier (according to Hoya) so that's the major reason. My questions for you:

1. Is this a good transition if I'm looking for a slightly speedier, easy to clean, long lasting pad?
2. What's the website to order for the US? The Hien Soft XL is in backorder. How often will they come back in stock?",best artisan mousepad alternatives
