"1. **Monster** - An incredible psychological thriller with a perfectly fitting art and animation style. Johan is godlike and it is my all time favorite anime

2. **Neon Genesis Evangelion** - Watched it for the giant robots. Got hooked by the story and realistic portrayal of the characters' mental issues. The animation became worse due to budget cuts but that fit in perfectly. The ending shown in The End of Evangelion was even better.

3. **Cowboy Bebop** - a true classic, it was simply perfect. A classic adventure story of bounty hunters combined with masterful storytelling, especially when revealing the characters' backstories, with one of the best soundtracks I've heard till date.

4. **Puella Magi Madoka Magica** - I'm glad I didn't skip it just because of the magical girls. It was unexpectedly good with dark psychological elements. I'll always recommend it even if you don't like magical girl anime.

5. **Death Note** - my first anime ever. Everything about it was great - the story, the animation, the characters, the soundtrack ... I might be a bit biased but Death Note will always be one of my favorite anime

6. **Gurren Lagann** - Gurren Lagann is the definition of epic. TL;DR: kick reason to the curb to make the impossible possible. The story is also good, but mind-blowing epic mecha action is the best thing about it. ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER!!

7. **Code Geass** - I found it sort of similar to death note. Lelouch executing his plans is always a treat to watch and there are GIANT ROBOTS. Plus an amazing ending in season 2.

8. **Steins;Gate** - sci-fi, comedy, romance, psychological thriller - Steins;Gate has everything. It's a masterpiece and I'll always recommend it.

9. **91 Days** - arguably the most un-anime-ish anime I've seen, this noir anime is pretty underrated imo. No silly anime tropes, just a pure story of friendship and revenge. The ending, while not perfect, fits the tone of the show.

10. **Erased** - an excellent psychological drama, the only thing I can complain about is the ending. Even then it's worth it."
"The Turbo is a good recommendation, but I‚Äôd just do the OG Pegasus. Not much different than the Turbo. It‚Äôs a touch less technical, but equally good as a mileage beater. It‚Äôs also $60 cheaper last time I checked."
Crash Team Racing if you like things like Mario Kart.
Got the blue silicone case for the Sierra Blue phone just because they match. I want a leather case (I currently use the green leather case with my XS Max and I love the feel) but I'm holding off until I can get to an Apple store to see firsthand how the colors look before deciding on one.
"The one where your entry level salary will be more than what you owe total in student loans (that's what my loan officer told me in the late 1990's). Your major is what is going to help you make money throughout your life, keep your hobbies out of it or make it a minor."
"This makes me feel better.  I heard that study claiming flossing was a waste of time and mouthwash was actually hurting your teeth.  It‚Äôs not that I distrust Colgate and Crest websites, but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to say, ‚Äúoh, yeah, this stuff will wreck your teeth, but buy it anyway you moron.‚Äù"
"Animal I have become by three days grace. I think this is bro metal, but it's a great song from my teenage years, also the beat perfectly lines up with my heart rhythm.

Lift me up by five finger death punch is great for the same reason..

Banging on drums by zero nine lifts my mood.

Mahakali by dissection just works because it's an incantation of the Hindu goddess Kali."
"I listen to it cause sometimes I just feel tired, I feel weak. And when I feel weak I feel like I want to just give up. 

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength and pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter, not matter how bad you you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse."
So how damaging is it? (See second part of my post)
"I too am a power excel user, I've found that the best way is to use vm fusion / bootcamp and use the windows version of excel....

Pretty bad that I can simultaneously run excel for mac and excel through a virtual machine and the the vm one is a million times better...."
"Consider how much daylight you want to lose.  It looks like you don‚Äôt get much light on the sides of your house. 

I‚Äôd only consider a small tree for your yard or else I think it would overwhelm your home."
ITT: Colgate?
Good old gin & tonic
I just ordered the spigen version of that case off of eBay for like $23. It has softer plastic on the edges so it‚Äôll be easier to use without the corners cracking.

"The only thing I didn't like about the RIU palace was that I tipped every bartender and pool side server $10+ a round and I still got shitty service. I know it's all inclusive but I work in the service industry and always tip. I'm not sure what the problem was but it rubbed me the wrong way. 

The food was okay but the buffet gets old after 3 days. If you head into town there are a lot of good restaurants by the marina but expect to pay at least $15 a plate. Taqueria el paisa had the best tacos al pastor I've ever had in my life and they were super cheap. 

All in all the RIU palace is the way to go. Steer clear from the RIU Santa fe. The palace is much nicer and you'll enjoy having a nice room and a fully stocked fridge fill of beer and your own liquor cabinet."
Electrical engineering?
"Been busy and haven‚Äôt really been venturing out to listen to stuff that‚Äôs less mainstream myself, but Roadrunner and Off Season are my favorites so far as well. 


Looking forward to Rashad and curious to see what Drake has to offer with CLB"

Tech21 Pure Clear lineup is my favorite iPhone cases. I have one on mine and then a black camo dbrand skin on the iPhone so it looks fuckin dope.
"Whatever it is, I don't want a ""to you for us"" gift. Or worse, the ""I think you need this"" gift that turns out to be a tool for a project your SO wants you to do."
