Ok, they almost did it."

23225,best social networking site for CS,"Social media is different. You can’t A/B test a printed newspaper in real time, and you can’t immediately blast something at the scale social media allows for on any other medium. Speed and quantity is the issue here, and it’s resulting in an eroding concept of truth.


The problem most people have, and what you’re guilty of, is the complete ignorance of inclusion and equality as a foundational necessity. If it’s not pursued from the jump, equality comes at the expense of someone else’s privilege. In this case, that privilege is using your money as a megaphone.


Say you have a landlord. It’s illegal to discriminate who he rents to. Yet, for years, he could go online and target ads for his vacancy to white, upper income families with kids, exploiting a lack of regulations. Now multiply these edge cases by millions and billions. Now take them all away... except you’re struggling to do that because it’s now your business model, propping up your valuation and pleasing shareholders. Your company is lobbying to prevent regulations, slowing down the velocity of change away from the circumstances that are more profitable for them.


Social media has beneficial elements, but if you have to crawl over dead bodies to enjoy them, it’s probably not as great as you think. You’re justifying something whose benefits you enjoy, not actually making a reasonable case for why social media gets a raw deal."
20429,best workout music,"Do you have Amazon Prime? Amazon Music is free for the non-unlimited one, which has more music. You can even download them. Spotify is free with Ads, so is Pandora."

60837,Best comedy show on Netflix,John Mulaney and Patton Oswalt. I’m sure Reddit will jump down my throat but bill burr is only funny if you love tired jokes as much as you hate women.
52086,best iphone case,"Like I said, my first one was similar to yours and my second one has been like new for as long as I had it. Which is basically a week or two since launch"
70385,best major to study in college,"I wish I went for social work and continued my hs Spanish that I was quite good at by getting a Spanish minor. It’s becoming clear to me that’s what I’m meant to do now that I have my first degree. I fell for the lie that the only worthy degrees are STEM, have a degree in ecology with a geology concentration, even though that doesn’t play to any of my strengths. I’m still young and saving a good amount of money so I may just go back."
3237,best webcamera,"That webcam is incredible, I'd highly recommend it for that price. It also does the rendering through the hardware of the camera so it's not intensive on your setup."

73592,best battery bank,"I use Villain Power Bank Portable Charger with 20000 mAh ( got here on Amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08527CGRT](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08527CGRT) ), for about three months already, and I gotta say that it's one of the most reliable thing I bring with me all the time. If your travel would last 4-5 days or even a whole week - it's gonna last for such period of time, charging everything, from laptops to any of your smartphone."
