> Firefox was abandoned

Again, I repeat myself for the umpteenth time, Firefox has not been abandoned. Well, if that's the case, is it possible that you give sources?

> everything that made it superior was removed, there is no Firefox anymore

Like what ? 

> it's not new version of Firefox, it's much worse product built on ruins of Firefox' greatness

[Firefox Quantum is a new version of Firefox.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/57)"

30427,best Mexican war to study,"The progression of violence from a planned picnic to trench warfare and civilian targeted mass destruction. If you've never read anything on the Civil War - start with April 1865: The Month That Saved America by Jay Winik.

What I find one of the saddest aspects of the Civil War is that the lessons learned were ignored... And those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The of the 'planners' and participants did not apply the lessons of what warfare had become in American Civil War to the Great War -- until thousands upon thousands of men were slaughtered and butchered. They just figured the Americans were savages and the Europeans would never fight that way. How damn wrong they were."

54271,best medicine for a cold,"But how big of a dick? I'm pretty sure not all Dick's were created equally. Are we talking black dickload or Asian dickload? I think if it were the latter, we would need to at least quadruple the amount. Or do you have to follow the dickload based off the size of your own dick? So the bigger the dick you have, the less quantity. But it will all equal out at the end since you have less of a quantity but a bigger serving size. 

And what about girls? Do they base it off the dick size of their dad or the last dick that they have had relations with? TBH I don't think girls should measure with dicks. Guys dicks sizes shouldn't be given out like that especially dads' to their daughters. Maybe they can use boob size. 

So guys can measure dickloads based on the size of their own dick while girls measure titloads based on the size of their hooters."

54244,best medicine for a cold,"Similar to Granny Clampett's (of the Beverly Hillbillies) cure. Take a shot of moonshine every two to four hours, drink plenty of water in between, get rest and in a week or two the cold is licked."
42997,best detective show,"True Detective (HBO) is great series. Season 1 and 3 are great. Watch season 2 if you are interested for more. Each season is its own story.

Also The Killing was a good series. I watched it on Netflix but it may be on other streaming services. It’s been awhile since I finished it."
17087,best iOS game,"It’s posts like these that make me see the diversity of gaming, and at that the diversity in the greatest of games. FTL is possibly my GOAT. I remember sort of hating it at the very initial outset and thinking it was just terrible from my first couple of short ending runs. Something like “wtf this crap is just full of rng. They clearly had better guns than me, why should I end my run to that.”

But then suddenly *snap* I was hooked on the next run by seeing some kind of strategy open up.
This game has strategy where you didn’t realise there was strategy even some 50 hours later. It’s one of those.

I’m not saying you shouldn’t be in to it as well, in fact the opposite and back to my original point that variety and what anyone likes in a game is a beautiful thing."
