"No.

They are little better than colas in terms of false promises and misleading advertising.  What the heck's wrong with eating healthy, exercising regularly, and getting a reasonable amount of rest?"

"Anything with malt powder.  
My uncle once took me out and I got a rocky road ice cream malt and suggested I get it with extra malt powder and it was absolutely amazing, and now I wont eat rocky road ice cream unless I have malt powder to put on it."

"Where I lived there was a local independent small chain, 3 stores. We bought nearly everything there. Service was excellent, price maybe 1/3 of the box stores. In Northern Ca, East Bay where would I have been without Sincere Hardware? Appliances, windows, cabinets, fixtures, doors and door knobs, sinks, toilets, faucets, lighting, granite counter top ... And service that does not run away from you."

"The study was done on the basis that we can't assume that time is linear, or that God performs miracles in linear time. Therefore, the hypothesis is that retroactively praying for patients, years after their initial infection and death/recovery, would reduce their mortality.

They randomly selected half of the cases and gave someone a list of their first names for a prayer to be made for them. Then they went and looked up the final result of each case, and found that the patients who received retroactive prayer had a better survival rate. Given the design of the experiment, which excluded all confounding variables, they concluded that retroactive prayer reduces mortality.

The paper is free to access, and pretty short."

"My sisters met Sofie Turner, I had just left to go get something to eat and she apparently lined up to do zip lining behind them. They were so amazed they met Sansa Stark and showed me the picture. I'd heard she was in town filming and that she as with Joe Jonas and realised from the picture angle someone else took it. Asked them who took it? Some dude she was with.... I laughed so hard I cried when I explained it was Joe Jonas and they felt so embarrassed and shook. They said he took it like a champ and took thier picture with her and then small chatted a bit about stuff to visit in the city. 

Also met Matthew McConaughey at a beach bar I worked at. He came in with bongos and sunglasses at 8pm on our busiest night and sat alone in a corner. When the drunk guy next time home turned finally and asked ""Arent you the McConaughey guy?"" He laughed and bought everyone drinks. Then proceeded to drink some more, took his shirt off at some point and played bongos with band."

Big LOL from me on that, bud."
Ready Player One would certainly count as an adventure!

"norm mcdonald.

he performed stand up at my college and i was in charge of helping out backstage, making sure he was taken care of and had everything he needed. he was such a goofy, funny guy. at the same time, super low maintenance and really nice. i think his only request was some tape so he could tape his set list to the floor."
"It's a hard sell I know. Brady has the rings.

But I view it this way: in the 16(?) seasons the two played in together, how many of them was Brady better? The undefeated season, the year Peyton was out with the injury, and Peyton's last two seasons. 4 out of 16/17 seasons.

Is Brady the most successful player ever? Absolutely. But it's hard for me to say he's the ""greatest"" if you're taking playoff success, awards, AND individual talent all into account."

"I have just installed openSUSE Tumbleweed 2 days ago, here are some tips:

I recommend downloading and booting from a NET (network installation) iso which you do not carry KDE, Gnome, Xfce, other excessive stuff, and etc. on contrary to DVD and live CD isos that contain whatever you may or may not need to install, so that you can install base openSUSE without all the bundle/suit software packages.

BEWARE: before going through the last step of the installation where there is a page with contents that are going to be installed, click on the “**details**” button at the bottom of the left blue panel then to *include/exclude whichever packages you want installed*, so you do not end up with installing all the default packages.

Additionally, on the same page I mentioned above, you will see on the content table, inside the hardware related settings header a clickable text which will open a page where it will automatically detect and configure the kernel for any hardware attached to your PC including your motherboard :) Make sure you have your hardware such as mouse, graphics tablet, etc. connected to your PC beforehand to let openSUSE be helping you optimizing your computer at its best :)

Having completed the installation process, you will be redirected to boot into openSUSE where you will be greeted with a pretty welcome screen. You can navigate on this welcome screen and pave the way you learn from there-in-after. Have a good journeyy! ;)"
"So I got these as samples but I'm really enjoying them right now: Midnight Romance by Ralph Lauren and Good Girl by Carolina Herrera. I'm not great at describing scents but these are more mature-smelling; good for a date night or feeling a bit sexy.  

As for all time favorites, Daisy Eau So Fresh by Marc Jacobs is wonderful. I also like Ralph by Ralph Lauren."

"This is startling. The ship I served on for the last 5 years, USS Thach FFG-43, uses 3 large RO units to make drinking water for the crew....  I wonder if thats the case around the Navy. I also wonder if thats an accepted negative due to the need for drinking water for long underways. Thanks for the information."
Irresponsible? That was downright nasty and spiteful. There is no defence for that one.
