I know most of here would disagree with me but I think Ranveer Singh is probably the greatest method actor this industry has produced in a long time.
"Mullvad, because nothing beats multiple open port forwarding."
"Hol up

THERES PINEAPPLE FLAVOR?"
My brother always carries a mini power strip when he travels. If he needs to charge he just asks anyone that is already charging to let him use the outlet. Then multiple people can use it.
The 1080i mode in GT4 looked worse than the 480p mode due to it being upscaled from 576i and have a lower colour count. Plus interlacing is yucky.
"Lawrence of Arabia
The Hidden Fortress
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"
"Yes. In that same spirit, my pick is Bircher Muesli.

Rolled oats, soaked overnight in a bit of water, with cut up or shaved apple, cinnamon, and (if it's cheap in your area) ground hazelnut. Serve warm or cold with milk. I usually add a wad of natural peanut butter.

Some variations use fruit juices or condensed milk. I find this way too sweet and therefore counterproductive from a health standpoint."
"Fuck yeah, Kansas City. I've never lived anywhere else, though."
"Lol well I don't give a shit regardless. I generally don't interact with people anyway and I tend to stay indoors.

I'm coming from IL, but I'm from Louisiana. I moved to Texas for a short while then IL. 

I've been in IL for a little over 2 years and I haven't made a single close friend here. I do have a few acquaintances, though. I expect the same in CO.

My gf will be with me if I go and she's more than enough company for me."
"AD will be Peterson for most of us that have been NFL fans since he has been in the league.  Donald is seldom referred to as AD, so it's confusing to refer to him as such when there is a more established user of the nickname.  (Not better player or more famous, just more closely associated with the abbreviation AD)."
[Studies have shown](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496046) that taking zinc within the first 24 hours of symptoms will actually reduce the duration and severity of the common cold.
Lots of people have sensitive teeth. They should use Sensodyne or something similar. Makes a big difference.
"Circus peanuts terrify me. I hear they taste like banana? If so, I'm with you: barf."
"One of my roommates in college had a couple of 4 lokos, was bouncing on the couch, and then gave himself a concussion from hitting his head. 
Was kinda amazing but also horrible."
"Dolphin..because it's default in KDE, and one of the most versatile graphical filemanagers out there, at least to my knowledge."
Or was it?
"Mad hoes ask beevis I get nothin butthead

Still my favorite line in hip hop ever"
"It's not quite a paper (though it has been cited 1000 times) as much as the edited transcript of a technical talk, but Purcell's [Life at Low Reynolds Number](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/purcell.pdf) has spectactular breadth and clarity of content.  It is mandatory reading if you're interested in physics at the biological scale.  It was a tremendous pleasure to read and read again."
"Those were sentimental tears then, I guess. Must have been overwhelming for your mum all the changes and your present must have been the sweetest thing. 

I’ve a 9 year old nephew and last year was tough for me, his innocent sweet cards and drawings for me brought me to tears more than once."
"This dopey bastard right here. http://imgur.com/Ehu5Gqn Given to us for free by some dude on the side of the road because he didn't wanna take him to the shelter. Best doggo ever in the world. 

Edit: Found his Christmas pic from a couple years ago. Thought it might be enjoyable to you lovely weirdos.  http://imgur.com/a3ikZVd"
Yup we might as well call it an open hatch SUV.
Wtf that’s the best candy on here
"My best friends mom used to make us a hot pepper and chicken soup whenever anyone got sick. 

Eat the soup. 

Do one shot of tequila. One shot. 

Take a nap. 

Worked every time."
"A difficulty you'll face in your search is the balance of resources available for effective reporting vs. pure objectivity. 

The Week and The Christian Science Monitor are wonderful sources of objective news. However, they are small. Neither has the reporting budget to break big stories on their own. They also don't have access. Washington insiders won't call up The Christian Science Monitor to leak a story. They'll call one of the big three, the NYT, the WSJ, or WaPo. 

Those big three have armies of reporters they can throw at stories. They can break news, important news, with resources smaller outlets cannot match. They will have sources inside Capitol Hill or the White House or national campaign organizations which smaller papers only dream about. This size comes at a price, though. All three have a subscriber base which they will not cross. 

I'm not capable of characterizing the biases of the big three insightfully enough for NeutralPolitics. Every reader can be perfectly objective on some topics, but every reader also has their biases which they do not recognize. This isn't the place for an argument. I don't think I can characterize the big three without starting one. 

I suspect you came here for a shortcut to an objective source. The best I can offer is to read all five until you have a sense of where they are strong and where they are weak."
When you emulate in on a PC it’s best to just upscale the 480p mode in 16:9 format. Interlacing on a full hd screen looks gross when things move a lot.
