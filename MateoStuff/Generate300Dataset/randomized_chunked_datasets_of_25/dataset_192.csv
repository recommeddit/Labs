22134,best celebrity,"Man, oh man, I have got to start rearranging my perceptions of these stars. Perhaps there are loads of them who get stuck in these roles/images which are not at all reflective of their actual nature, simply due to the fact that they are forced to make a viable career out of what they have chosen to do."

63566,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,I’m using it alongside Cydia. It’s not perfect as there’s a few small issues. I would say this is the Cydia successor instead of Sileo. I will admit the downloading menu in Sileo looks nicer than both Cydia and Zebra though

28946,best breakfast foods,"Overnight oats. If you use steel cut oats, they aren't as soggy as rolled oats and still retain the textured chewiness.

Basic idea of most recipes:
1/4 cup steel cut oats
1/2 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon chia seeds
Put in your container in the fridge for 12 hours

In the morning, top with whatever. Banana, cocoa powder, and natural peanut butter are delicious. Stir and eat.

So much variety. Can eat them hot or cold. No added sugar and healthy for you."
