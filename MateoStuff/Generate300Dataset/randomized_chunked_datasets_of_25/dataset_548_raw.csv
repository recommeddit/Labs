Tissue at the cellular level is not much different from bacteria so yes, some of it does get affected. As I understand it, the tissues are more tightly packed together and regenerate much quicker so it's usually not a problem.  It will become a problem if you swish with alcohol more than recommended.  
  
  
>What about lower concentrations than killing?  are microbes making poor reproductive decisions if I wash my mouth with beer, or liquor hitting the intestine deluted?    
    
Probably not advisable to wash your mouth with beer or alcohol since it contains carbs, which would probably counteract whatever antibacterial benefit you derive from it."

"If you are going to spend on nice knives, when it comes to knife sharpening I’d highly suggest either really learning how to do it with stones / grinders, or actually having them professionally sharpened every year or so. It makes a world of difference to have truly proper geometry I don’t believe there are any reasonable consumer sharpeners out there.  If you’re just using cheap knives, a cheap sharpener woo get you back to sharper than dull - but I haven’t seen many people very happy with just buying a sharpener and sharpening their own knives especially once they compare them to a correctly sharpens knife. 

Between uses stropping should get you back to razor sharp if the original sharpening was done well."
"I set games to be at lowest 65, never seen any flickering. An hour ago was playing Cyberpunk with FPS average 80, lowest 1% 63, peaks at 90 (limited), didn’t see any flickering."

"If you wanna compare something to Axios, have a look at [Wretch](https://github.com/elbywan/wretch). It's a pretty nice wrapper around fetch that focuses on improving the development experience. It also comes in at only 2.8 Kb gzipped, which I believe is about one-tenth of Axios (which is around 30Kb somewhere, I think?)."

"I've heard a lot about greens compared to blues, what's the difference between the two?"
I learned a little violin and the women all loved it. I don't even play that well they were just impressed that I own one.

I am not familiar with Intel CPUs. I have the Ryzen 5 1600. For Budget builds its generally recommended to go the AMD route. I personally would recommend the Ryzen 5 2600 or 2600x.

"To be fair, basic hookup like water and electrical are usually included with the delivery. More complicated appliances like dishwashers or appliances with gas hookups are usually charged extra.

For Lowes, you need to contact the specific store and make an appointment for a subcontractor for another ~$70 or whatever they charge.  
Whereas with Home Depot, you can checkout online and tack on installation with a $20 checkbox.

When I bought my Bosch dishwasher from Lowes, they gave me a generic power cord instead of the proper one I paid for & I had to run around to get an electrical fitting on top of that."
