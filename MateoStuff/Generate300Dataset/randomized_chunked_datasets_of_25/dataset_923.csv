10422,best suitcase lock,maybe you should stop putting in hand grenades in your checked luggage to stop having them stolen
46863,best hand santizer brand,"Yeah...if our hands our dirty, it's not just germs but also particles or dirt that are on our hands. Using hand sanitizer may kill germs but it still leaves dirt and residue. Ewww."
5161,best home improvement store,"I find Loweâ€™s (at least near me) has better finish items, while HD has more rough-in stuff. 

Itâ€™s also about the staff. At Loweâ€™s where I used to live, getting competent help was hard, at HD I was beating them off with a stick. 

Now that Iâ€™ve moved; The closest Loweâ€™s is 45 min away. Closest HD is 20."

10340,best suitcase lock,Will I still be prepared for emergency celebrations and making other people look fabulous?
43000,best detective show,"I'm surprised you listed Better Call Saul but not Breaking Bad... did you not like it, or have you not seen it? If you haven't seen it, then... BREAKING BAD! 

Only 4 seasons, but Mr. Robot is fucking fantastic (not on Netflix unfortunately, but I really recommend trying to watch it). Hannibal is also great, but there are only 3 seasons. 

Bates Motel is so good and creepy, but it might be a bit campy for you. 

If you want an endless supply of true crime, Forensic Files is the way to go. Like a million episodes, but they're very formulaic."

26210,best politician,Cato was overly conservative and probably lead to Caesar's Civil War.  Cicero was the real hero in the whole thing.  Political moderate and orator extraordinaire that tried to save the Republic.  A pragmatist and enemy of Mark Antony.
22031,best celebrity,"Well again, it was this big concert in 2012 (got that corrected).  There were a bunch of big name acts that all performed for like 20 minutes a piece on a big rotating stage.  Crew would be prepping one side of the stage while one act is performing and then the stage would rotate around for the next act so that there was only like 3 minutes of turn around.  Each artist also came to our press area to run a gauntlet of quick interviews and then do a meet and greet with a few fans who won radio station contests.

So obviously the schedule was extremely tight and precise.  Again, there were quite a few very popular acts including Justin Beiber, and everyone was on point, right on schedule, except for Avril who apparently thought she was a big enough star that she refused to come out of her bus, fucked up the performance schedule and cancelled her meet and greet.  She only did the interviews that she had to and everyone was basically told don't talk to her, don't look at her, anyone not essential leaves.  As opposed to Kelly who came early to individually say hi to all of our interns before doing her thing."
15332,best tree for the garden,"Where I'm from, most people consider them a problem because they'll crush your water pipes to get to the water. A lot of houses in my old neighborhood got rid of them because they were doing too much damage to their pipes."
