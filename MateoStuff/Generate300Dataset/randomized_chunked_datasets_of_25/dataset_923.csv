Itâ€™s also about the staff. At Loweâ€™s where I used to live, getting competent help was hard, at HD I was beating them off with a stick. 

Now that Iâ€™ve moved; The closest Loweâ€™s is 45 min away. Closest HD is 20.",best home improvement store

43000,"I'm surprised you listed Better Call Saul but not Breaking Bad... did you not like it, or have you not seen it? If you haven't seen it, then... BREAKING BAD! 

Only 4 seasons, but Mr. Robot is fucking fantastic (not on Netflix unfortunately, but I really recommend trying to watch it). Hannibal is also great, but there are only 3 seasons. 

Bates Motel is so good and creepy, but it might be a bit campy for you. 

If you want an endless supply of true crime, Forensic Files is the way to go. Like a million episodes, but they're very formulaic.",best detective show

22031,"Well again, it was this big concert in 2012 (got that corrected).  There were a bunch of big name acts that all performed for like 20 minutes a piece on a big rotating stage.  Crew would be prepping one side of the stage while one act is performing and then the stage would rotate around for the next act so that there was only like 3 minutes of turn around.  Each artist also came to our press area to run a gauntlet of quick interviews and then do a meet and greet with a few fans who won radio station contests.

So obviously the schedule was extremely tight and precise.  Again, there were quite a few very popular acts including Justin Beiber, and everyone was on point, right on schedule, except for Avril who apparently thought she was a big enough star that she refused to come out of her bus, fucked up the performance schedule and cancelled her meet and greet.  She only did the interviews that she had to and everyone was basically told don't talk to her, don't look at her, anyone not essential leaves.  As opposed to Kelly who came early to individually say hi to all of our interns before doing her thing.",best celebrity
