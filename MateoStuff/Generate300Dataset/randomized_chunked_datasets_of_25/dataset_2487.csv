51457,"Not sure if I understand your question. Anyway, as I said, naked phone + screen protector (Spigen seems to be the best) is my personal preference. That is how I use it on my 11 pro and same as my gf will use it on her 12 pro. Since I took my Pitaka MagEZ off and realized how it feels, I never went back. If you care how it looks and feels in hand and you can afford Applecare, go for it, you will never regret that.

Otherwise, MagEZ case from Pitaka seems to be the best compromise between style and security. Anything thinner does not seem to have any sense as protection and anything thicker will make your phone look like a brick.",best iphone case

Based on all the post, I would use this post by (\_searching\_) as a guide to make my decision. He outlined the nuances and differences between the 3 drop zones. It all depends on what you are looking for as  a ""culture"". In regards to reputation and professionalism, I feel that all 3 drop zones are equal based on what I have heard from other skydivers.
