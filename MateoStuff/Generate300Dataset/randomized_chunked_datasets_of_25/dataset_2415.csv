My grandma cried seeing the photos and said it is one of the best presents she's gotten from all of us since some of us don't live in the area anymore.",best gifts for mom

71632,"the others, the departed, old boy (korean), welcome to the JLA (korean)
the departed (and it's original infernal affairs) and welcome to the JLA are kind of twisty thrillers so it isn't as much a twist ending as the movie catching you off guard every 10 minutes.
 
I liked the endings of Saw 1 and 2 as well. 

Also haven't seen the original twist ending movie mentioned here but if you haven't seen it this the original american twist ending movie: The usual suspects",best movies with a cool twist

31140,"Just wanted to say that Canada will treat you well. Some of the negative points described in response to your comment are apt for suburbs but not indicative of the whole country. I have lived in Europe and to compare, you will have much more social mobility here; be able to actually afford property and build real equity in a way that you can pass down to your children in a way that you cannot in Europe (we complain about the cost of buying houses in big cities like Toronto and Vancouver but *it doesn't hold a candle* to the expense of owning in Paris or London); buy whatever the hell car you want and not have to worry about a tax on the engine size; and outdoor activities are incredible here. It is an enormous country so many cities have built 'out' from the downtown cores, which leads to problems listed accurately in u/polskadz13's comment (parks are not as nice as Europe, too many Boston Pizza's, cookie-cutter neighbourhoods, comparatively weak public transit system, etc.) but the ease with which you can live outside of town and drive in is incredible. It is a great place. Many of us do not travel and live abroad ever in our lives and therefore begin to miss out on how unique Canada really is.
