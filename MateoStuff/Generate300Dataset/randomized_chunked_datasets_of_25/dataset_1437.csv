41401,"Extended answer:

Music notation is basically set up for piano. The notes are all in a row, every octave played the same as the last, most people even refer to the staves as left hand and right hand, because that's how you would generally approach it with a piano. A piano isn't just some instrument, like a saxophone, or a ukulele, it's a logical tool set up to play music, so it fits naturally with notation. It's like the predecessor to MIDI and recorded music, it was the best way to get all of those notes in with a single person. 

You also wont need to build calluses for piano, or spend 15 years getting your picking hand accurate and fast, no painful muting technique practice, you get to sit down on stage, you generally have a wider range of pitches, you have a fuckload more options when it comes to close harmony and wide intervals, general harmony and polyphony, you can even bend pitches on many keyboards, as well as accessing a wide range of timbres, you will likely learn notation immediately(rather than learning guitar tab and then trying to learn notation), and because notation is set up so logically it will help you learn theory faster. 

There are few things it can't do in relation to other instruments, but when it can, or can e manipulated to do so easily then other instruments are basically pointless. 

If instruments were used for cooking rather than music you could use matches, or rub sticks together, or hold it closer to the sun, but the piano is like an oven, it is scientifically designed to be the best device for its purpose so far.",best instrument to play

Nashville has a great nightlife for tourists. Just go down to Broadway and there are plenty of honky-tonks and other various bars with live music. There's also amazing restaurants.

Otherwise, there's the Green Hills Mall which is about ten minutes from downtown.",best state to visit in the United States
