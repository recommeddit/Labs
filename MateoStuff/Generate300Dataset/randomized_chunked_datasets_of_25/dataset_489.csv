47741,"Either of the calculators linked by u/ PeanutTheFerret should work fine, but _don't_ get the TI-84 CE you linked. The colors look nice, but it uses the same Z80 chip as the original ti-84, and the color calculations bog it down a lot.

(Edit: I'm wrong about this, see the thread below. The CE should be fine)

If you're looking for something inexpensive, go with a regular ti-84. If you want something fancier, the nspire series is nice, if a bit overkill of a calculus class.",best graphing calculator for vector calculus

Everyone here keeps saying CompSci like it's a gravy train to high salaries. The fact of the matter is, a large number of people who do CS are not qualified in any way to become software engineers - they do the degree because they think it'll set them up without putting in the work to build their resumes or get internships or do side projects.

West Coast: Seattle, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite, Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Disney Land (Anaheim, CA), San Diego.  That's mostly North-South, with no other ordering there.  You could pick your interests.  Big cities?  Seattle, and SF for sure.  Beach? San Diego.  Mountains?  Yosemite if you don't mind crowds, Tahoe if you want a little more quiet.  Vegas and Grand Canyon just to say you been there.
