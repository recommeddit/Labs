They can give you information on lots of different resorts from their previous customers' experiences. Then you can check what they suggest against reviews on tripadvisor or similar site. Who knows they might even give you a better price if you find it cheaper on the web.",best vacation resort

32561,"Just got back from my second cruise with Norwegian. 

* Had terrible flight days -- nightmare drivers on the way there and stranded in airport overnight on the way back. 
* Had one bad shore excursion, one rescheduled excursion, and one cancelled excursion. 
* Had an allergic reaction that kept me basically immobile for 3 days.

With all of that, I still had a freaking fantastic time.  The people are friendly. The food is great. The boat is clean and has tons of entertainment. When there's a problem, they are helpful. 

There's nothing better than sitting on a balcony over the open ocean at sunset, drinking a beer or a cup of hot tea, and reading some trashy genre novel with someone you love. I can't recommend it enough.

LPT: If you are on one of the older boats with mini-suites on the back of the boat, they are worth the upgrade. You'll get way more space, better service and a much better balcony for only 7-8% higher fare.",best vacation resort

Public Enemy 

Uncle Luke- scarred 

2 live crew

Uncle Al (RIP, but if he can’t get you moving you probably have no pulse to begin with.)

Krayzie Bone (Heated heavy, get you twisted, I don’t give a fuck)

That last one was a lil Jon track but he has shit to get your blood going.

Many may be unfamiliar but old school Pitbull is undeniable. Forget any of the new stuff. Like seriously.

Digital Underground has fun energetic shit too.

MOP- ante up (you’ll get pumped and someone might end up bleeding)

Wu tang- gravel pit

Cool breeze- watch for the hook

OutKast- skew it on the Bar-b, Rosa parks, B.O.B., ghettomusick

Killer Mike- akshon ( or anything including RTJ)

Big Boi- kill Jill

The Indian Express: For it's pragmatic editorials. Though most of them end up bashing the the Congress party, it's not that irritating and are usually written in a 'matter of fact' manner.
