12398,"It depends on what my mom is into.  She switches hobbies like some people switch underwear.   This summer, she was really into camping, so, for Mother's Day, I made her a camping kit.  One year she was really into healthy cooking so I got her a grow-your-own herb kit, some cookbooks, and a grocery store gift card.   One year she was into making her own sugar scrubs, so I got her a kit of essential oils and some decorative containers. 

I don't have much money, so I can't do a whole lot, but I think she is really surprised when she gets something pertaining to her new hobby because it shows that I do listen to her.",best gifts for mom
