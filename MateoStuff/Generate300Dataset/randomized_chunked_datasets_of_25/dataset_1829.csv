11889,best gifts for dad,"My Mom isn't well so Dad has done the majority of the cooking for years.

He gets so happy when I bake a pie or some other kind of dessert.  Going out to eat is no big deal and he doesn't really NEED stuff.  But for him to be pampered.. he loves it.  

Mom couldn't leave the house so my husband and I prepared dinner and brought it for mother's day.  She wasn't happy but kept her insults about my cooking to a minimum but Dad was like a pig in sunshine.  He didn't have to leave the house to not have to cook!"

69406,best major to study in college,"If I had it to do over, I would have gone EE instead of CS. Seems like most of the programmers I work with have an EE, and while I can only qualify for the IT/CS type jobs, they can pretty much qualify for every job at our company.

And looking at my old college catalog, it was 14 less units. Damn."

But we all know that's a crock of shit, and that the harmonica and/or piano is one of the best sounding instruments in the right hands."
23624,best car racing video game,"I love Forza but that game has absolutely 0 progression, with a few lucky wheel spins you can buy absolutely any car in the game unless it's one of those rare ones that cost 10mil credits because they come from events. It's a good game to drive around, race and free roam but it has 0 progression"

29743,best money managing app,"Intuit got greedy and stifled innovation by insisting banks pay them monthly fees to be compatible with Quicken OFX so your bank is synced with your local account. OFX is an open protocol that could be used by any bank, utility, credit card company or lender, but because Quicken sucks, it will only sync with the handful of companies that bother with it. Intuit sold off the Quicken part of the company a few years ago due to its failed business model.  

Use MoneyDance."
