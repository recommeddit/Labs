I always liked Asics for their nice wide toe box until I tried the Nike Free. I was an instant convert.

"The 18 is simply fantastic, the 25 is one of the finest things I've ever had."
Yeah the concept game was basically a large demo for the GT4 engine.
"GIN?! I HATE GIN! GET ME A BEER! GET ME A BEER!

Dee, you bitch!"
What about textbooks? I need to look for some this year some advice would be greatly helpful
Those eyes.
It would be a lot in theme if Piglet would cut a piece of him for Winnie to eat.
Using Nemo because it was the first one I got to work
"Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night - Excellent metriodvania by the man himself. 

Huntdown - Modern contra type game. One IAP to unlock the whole game. Great game. 

Civilization VI - I still can’t believe how well this works on a phone. 

PUBG Mobile - Incant help enjoying the hell out of this game. It really captures the spirit of the PC game."
"Ideally you'd want your camera to be as far away as possible too, for [narrow angle to make your face look as good as possible](https://steemitimages.com/p/3q52Dkr5nBe3i4rvL8ErWaBPivbAzVEW1d5toTzNWftCsaTNAx2bXWqhMiDYfywbnLgsw4mZPUYE2?format=match&mode=fit&width=1280).

"Can you make your double strokes rolls sound like single stroke rolls at all tempos from 30bpm to 240bpm at various dynamic levels from soft to loud? Can you play triplets and consistently hit rim shots, without playing loudly, on every single first note? Can you at will choose to hit rim shots in different ways to make them sound differently, and do so consistently as though you were just choosing piano keys to press? Can you play a paradidlde pattern in triplets and make it sound like you are just playing a single stroke roll? What is the purpose of paradiddles? What is the difference between Gladstone technique and Moeller technique and is it possible to combine them? Can you flip your stick between matched grip and traditional grip in half a second consistently without dropping your stick? Can you play in both matched grip and traditional grip? Can you insert flams into your patterns without compromising the rhythmic integrity? Do you ever mute your drums with your hand? What are the different spots on a drum where you can hit and how does it affect the response and sound? Can you do an even buzz roll and vary the dynamics? Can you drum non-stop for two hours frequently without getting carpal tunnel syndrome? You have barely scratched the surface."
It's refreshing as fuck

Is it so wrong to want a day without my daughter?  I'm a stay at home mom of a hyper 2 yr old. My husband went on a business trip and it was just the two of us for a week. By the end she was getting on my nerves. I love my daughter but is it so wrong to want a day to myself?
I cant stop by flux pavilion
"Ace for little things, Lowe’s for big things. Sometimes Menards. Home Depot only as a last resort because 1) it is hardest to get to despite being closer than Menards and 2) getting anyone to help requires an act of God."

"8+ by a long way, worst iphone i’ve had is the XS by a long way. 
Honourable mention goes to the iphone 4"
