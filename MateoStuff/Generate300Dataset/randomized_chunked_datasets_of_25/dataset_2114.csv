47107,"I disagree - Chicago might be the only city in the Mid-West with enough public transportation to get pretty much anywhere you need to without a car.

Parking for an hour in Chi-town is also horrible.  Parking at your hotel overnight in Chicago is also horrible.

Food for thought - if you have kids consider a car for convenience, but a young couple might get away with no car in Chicago.",best state to visit in the United States

32182,"When i was in Ireland i stayed in this place called the Killarney Guest House. Super cute place. They were situated like houses but had an area where you could eat breakfast.. you also had your own private room, with a private bathroom. The breakfast was so good, a full breakfast, and the people that ran it were super nice. Our beds were always made, the rooms were clean.

The location was great too. Right across from Cork college and about a mile walk from the town where there were tons of bars and shopping.

It was a nice place to stay that wasnt exactly a “hotel” type place

Only downfall was no elevators and we had to climb three flights of stairs with our luggage",best hotel to live in
