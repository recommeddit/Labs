47107,best state to visit in the United States,"I disagree - Chicago might be the only city in the Mid-West with enough public transportation to get pretty much anywhere you need to without a car.

Parking for an hour in Chi-town is also horrible.  Parking at your hotel overnight in Chicago is also horrible.

Food for thought - if you have kids consider a car for convenience, but a young couple might get away with no car in Chicago."

Which ones you want in particular is...up to you, and depends on your interests, other geographic regions of interest, etc."
29523,best game console,"The game got bad publicity because of the costant delays, their failure to keep up to date with the release date and the lock at 30fps

It's good game with a lot of promises, I prefer off road racing though like WRC games and Motorstorm games, but Driveclub is awesome too if you want graphics like Need for Speed The Run"

65395,best phone service company,"They have good coverage. However, if you dont have either the ""Play more"", ""Do more"", or ""Get More"" unlimited plan, they will put your device under whats called network management. What it actually is that you are be deprioritized and throttled throughout the day. So if you are having issues with data, make sure you aren't on the ""Start Unlimited"" plan. 

Also, if you have wi-fi in your home, make sure that wi-fi calling is turned on. It' s a free feature from VZW"
13703,best research paper archive,"[Hodgkin and Huxley's classic 1952 papers describing the action potential.](http://www.sfn.org/skins/main/pdf/HistoryofNeuroscience/hodgkin5.pdf)

32182,best hotel to live in,"When i was in Ireland i stayed in this place called the Killarney Guest House. Super cute place. They were situated like houses but had an area where you could eat breakfast.. you also had your own private room, with a private bathroom. The breakfast was so good, a full breakfast, and the people that ran it were super nice. Our beds were always made, the rooms were clean.

The location was great too. Right across from Cork college and about a mile walk from the town where there were tons of bars and shopping.

It was a nice place to stay that wasnt exactly a “hotel” type place

Only downfall was no elevators and we had to climb three flights of stairs with our luggage"
