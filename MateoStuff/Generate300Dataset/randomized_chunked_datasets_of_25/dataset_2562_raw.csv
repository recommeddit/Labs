Don't forget the Motorstorm series. Those games are the reason I kept my PS3.
Great work
"I personally also avoid cold medicine and try to just rest and take it easy instead BUT not all people feel the same way with a cold or have a choice to rest or have the same duration of a cold. Being congested is annoying to me, but if you're asthmatic it might be pretty hazardous.

Basically you don't know what other people are dealing with and if decongestants make them feel better then where is the harm? Treating an illness doesn't make you a weaker person."

Did you ever meet any celebrities?
"Can I take this out of context, plz?"
Anyone here ever use John Varvatos by John Varvatos?
"Oak tree!

Or an apple or cherry blossom tree! Smack in the middle of the lawn! :)"

Eggs can be so rude like that

GRID is my favorite. Just avoid GRID 2 though because its hot garbage.
The what now?
Me too. That and the Martian chronicles.
"so the courses that teach you just how to perform a job are the ""good"" ones and the courses that teach you how to think are the ""bad"" ones....Mmmmm,....ok, got it."
"Great work on this. FYI, I was looking at Red Pocket's family plan, and it looks like it is now offered on all 4 networks according to https://www.redpocket.com/plans/family, while your table only shows Sprint and AT&T if I'm not mistaken."
"Best part about this stat is how low India's W/L ratio is in the 2010s.

It shows how competitive teams are these days. I feel the future of Test cricket is bright in that way."
Haha... because its literally wax and sugar!
"Are greatest and best synonymous for this question? For me, winning is part of greatness, but it doesn't necessarily make you the best. Brady is pretty unarguably greater than Peyton imo, but I still believe Peyton is/was better.

There is no such thing as a Best Football Player every I don't think, but Greatest could be any of, Brady, Montana, Jerry, and then my pick, Otto Graham."
An ukulele is a good place to start. Its easy to pick up a couple songs quick.
"Aah, I have a few from my 20s. 

There was a natural disaster which required staff to stay on site with a floor to themselves. Bathtubs were filled with ice and booze and managers were found wandering backhalls in their undies. 

Michelin chef and F&B manager caught on camera cheating on their partners in a stairwell. 

Leaders of [redacted] in town for global governmental meetings, eating chicken in the lobby and throwing the bones on the floor. 

My friend was the GM of one of one of the most famous high-end hotels in America, and shared a story about a resident of their penthouses having a mental breakdown, destroying everything, ripping the sink off the wall, and sprinting down the hallway naked and getting tackled by security. His neighbors include CEOs of Fortune 50s. 

The reasons the prices are so high isn't the rent, we owned the building. Bought it from a failed casino owner turned political leader for pennies. The prices were influenced first by extremely high payroll, then quality, then profit.

Edit:
Also, people die in hotels all the time. Age, stress, whatever. It's not uncommon to get calls from concerned spouses, do a wellness check, and oof. They're rolled out the back during quiet hours. 

There's a decent amount of theft internally, but the workers all protect and cover for each other, and turn on managers that catch them.

These major established properties, the staff is pretty akin to the Mafia. They make things happen. 

Not as much drug use as others mentioned at ours. A lot of the f&b staff was past their 20s."
"That is very kind of your cousin, and I'm so sorry about your brother. I lost one of my best friends to epilepsy when we were 15."
"Actually I’ve beat that, guess that would’ve been something to add"
"Real Madrid '55-'60
Ajax '70-'74 (ish)
Bayern '74-'76
Milan '88 - '95
Barcelona '09-'12

That's my top 5."
