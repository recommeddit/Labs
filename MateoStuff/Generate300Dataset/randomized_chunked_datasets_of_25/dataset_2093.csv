57204,"My feeling is that the only difference is which city's tap water is being bottled.  That said, I can taste some differences.  The Nestle bottled water tastes de-ionized, like it belongs in my car battery.  Maybe it's steam-distilled; I don't know. The Naya water that we sell at my store (Lowe's, western Canada) claims to come from Quebec, and tastes much better than the Nestle.  Our tap water in Calgary comes from one of two glacier-fed lakes in the Rockies and has been tested for MacLean's (a Canadian news magazine) as some of the best tap water in the world, so I only bother with the bottled stuff when portability is an issue.",best water brand

37097,Scenery and maintenance can play a huge part in the experience.  For one example that involves both I think FoF at KD is garbage and the one at KI is amazing.  The pre-show theme adds to the experience and when I get off the KD one I tend to have a headache while the KI one I don't seem to have the same issue (even though they both actually seem like similar ride experiences),best amusement park

I'd rather put in either Resistance, One Night Ultimate, or Secret Hitler to cover the bluffing/betrayer genre of board games. Other than that it's a pretty complete list.",best board games

Those trackers are normally a one pixel image that gets loaded from an external server. The second you load it, the server sees you accessed that one pixel resource and notifies the sender that the email has been opened.",best Chrome extensions

I did it for a golf tournament at work... made bobble heads out of management... I don't know if i actually remember what software I ended up using to scan the heads...

60246,"Yes, the ice buildup will reduce efficiency, and you will have to empty it for the manual defrost. I would do it once a year on a really cold day and put the stuff outside to stay frozen. If you live in a humid area, the ice might build up so fast that you'd have to defrost more than once a year.

It's definitely a trade-off. Manual defrost takes more work, but if you don't mind the work, you can store things longer for cheaper.",best freezer brand

Better sound. Smoother. Crisper click event. Just better. 

I like them a ton (I put them above any other cherry mount click switch, including other boxes, and perhaps tied with SMK 2nd gen Blues). 

Perhaps only some alps clickies or model f/m spring feel better.",best keyboard switches
