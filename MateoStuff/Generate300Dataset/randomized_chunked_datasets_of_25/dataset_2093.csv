71571,best movies with a cool twist,Snowpiercer  has a nice little bit near at the end.  Makes you feel betrayed by the whole movie. üôÉ
52310,best hiphop album,Basically standard issue list except for a couple
67673,axios alternatives reddit,"The one maintained by GitHub.

57204,best water brand,"My feeling is that the only difference is which city's tap water is being bottled.  That said, I can taste some differences.  The Nestle bottled water tastes de-ionized, like it belongs in my car battery.  Maybe it's steam-distilled; I don't know. The Naya water that we sell at my store (Lowe's, western Canada) claims to come from Quebec, and tastes much better than the Nestle.  Our tap water in Calgary comes from one of two glacier-fed lakes in the Rockies and has been tested for MacLean's (a Canadian news magazine) as some of the best tap water in the world, so I only bother with the bottled stuff when portability is an issue."
16762,best pet for toddlers,"Labrador Retrievers are the official best dogs for families! Mine was sweet and gentle with children and she had a very patient personality. Kids would yank her tail and ears, poke her in the eyes, try to ride her.... she just let it all happen and loved them all the same :)"
68806,best science fiction novel,I still think this flow chart for the [NPR Top 100 Science Fiction & Fantasy Books](http://imgur.com/gdhMg.jpg) is my favorite way to pick out books.
9746,best dorm hall at UCSB,But it's gone..
16998,best iOS game,"I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve enjoyed HS, because my experience with that game is just... ugh."
37097,best amusement park,Scenery and maintenance can play a huge part in the experience.  For one example that involves both I think FoF at KD is garbage and the one at KI is amazing.  The pre-show theme adds to the experience and when I get off the KD one I tend to have a headache while the KI one I don't seem to have the same issue (even though they both actually seem like similar ride experiences)
3083,best webcamera,Have you by chance updated to the 2.0.56 firmware version? (Installer 2.7.72.0) https://prosupport.logi.com/hc/articles/360039591834-Download-BRIO-Ultra-HD-Pro-Business-Webcam
26342,best politician,how so?
59153,best perfume,Pink sugar!
24939,best spiderman actor,Tobey but I feel like that's the nostalgia talking
26576,best board games,"I don't think any Forbidden game needs to be on this list as Pandemic already covers the co op mechanic very nicely. I'd rather put in either Resistance, One Night Ultimate, or Secret Hitler to cover the bluffing/betrayer genre of board games. Other than that it's a pretty complete list."
23230,best social networking site for CS,Sounds to me you need better devs lmao.
39901,best Chrome extensions,"Useful tip to avoid these: turn off ‚Äúautomatically load images and attachments‚Äù on your email client. Those trackers are normally a one pixel image that gets loaded from an external server. The second you load it, the server sees you accessed that one pixel resource and notifies the sender that the email has been opened."
12066,best gifts for dad,"So... Fun fact, you can use an XBox Kinect to scan your own head, then using some software, you can make a 3d model that you can send to a 3d printer, and make your own bobble head!

I did it for a golf tournament at work... made bobble heads out of management... I don't know if i actually remember what software I ended up using to scan the heads...

\*edit* ReconstructMe is the software that i used."
33551,best electric car,So they got free electricity. Ooh.
60246,best freezer brand,"Yes, the ice buildup will reduce efficiency, and you will have to empty it for the manual defrost. I would do it once a year on a really cold day and put the stuff outside to stay frozen. If you live in a humid area, the ice might build up so fast that you'd have to defrost more than once a year.

It's definitely a trade-off. Manual defrost takes more work, but if you don't mind the work, you can store things longer for cheaper."
5282,best home improvement store,"We did our first home with blinds from Home Depot 13 years ago, they are still hanging in the same house."
72616,best keyboard switches,"Box whites/pinks are what you‚Äôd want cherry blues to be. An upgrade in every way, and a decidedly ‚Äòdelicate‚Äô feel. 

Better sound. Smoother. Crisper click event. Just better. 

I like them a ton (I put them above any other cherry mount click switch, including other boxes, and perhaps tied with SMK 2nd gen Blues). 

Perhaps only some alps clickies or model f/m spring feel better."
51326,best iphone case,I haven‚Äôt. I typically get the liquid armor.
63052,Best online React course,Wish I had better German (should had done better in my classes)
2542,best headphones,"Haha, you know what they say, there are some things in life you shouldn't cheap out on.  We just happen to think headphones should be in said mixture. :)  Nothing wrong with that right?  I mean it's not like I was offending anyone :$"
13055,best gifts for mom,I wish my family celebrated Christmas almost a month early.
