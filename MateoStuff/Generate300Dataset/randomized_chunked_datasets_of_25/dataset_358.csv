38473,best newspapers to read,"As a private investigator, a physical newspaper is part of my uniform.  I get the national post.  But I also read the globe and mail and toronto star on my iphone.  Canadian papers."
43277,best detective show,not getting into it and tried.
69334,best major to study in college,"Did psychology, would go back and do Biology. It turns out psych is NOT the right major if you want to become a psychiatrist (MD).

I'm doing fine, but IMO, psychiatry has got to be one of the most cake professions out there. You make real MD money and are highly respected, but don't need to go through the incredible daily stress of practicing real medicine. 

In contrast, psychologists and mental health counselors, even at the doctoral level, make *peanuts* (comparatively) to see patients with similar issues that psychiatrists see."
35395,best alcoholic drink,"Gin Bucket- 1.75 L bottle of cheap gin. 2 2 Liter bottles of Sprite. 1 can each of frozen lemonade and limeade concentrate. 6 lemons and 6 limes sliced in rounds. Put everything into a large Styrofoam cooler and add a big bag of ice.Let it sit for a few hours before the party and essentially you'll have super refreshing alcoholic lemonade that has barely the slightest hint of the taste of gin. Seriously, everyone loves this stuff the first time they taste it. Cheers."
24053,best anime,"Damn! Forgot to put Evangelion on my list! 

Can I ask why naruto (not shippuden)?"
66837,best soccer team in the world,Unlucky with the group more than anything.
47751,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"I was able to use it for all of my undergrad classes for Calc 1-3, DifEq and other higher level math. Never had a problem. I guess it could vary by university"
58514,best cologne,"it depends on your chemistry. i really like armani diamonds, it makes me want to jump on a guy if he wears it (though on my ex it didn't smell so good). i also like old standards such as drakkar noir."
36944,best roller coaster at six flags,"Bat, Roar, Supes"
58808,best cologne,Can confirm. Got my first bottle for Christmas in eighth grade. Haven't looked back since.
61134,Best comedy show on Netflix,Yeah everything about the blacklist is just so average EXCEPT one thing and thats Spader. Somehow his performance alone somehow nullifies all the issues and results in a show thats far from average
7520,best laptop for general use,"for what you are describing. maybe an Asus Pro-Art studio book.  It sounds like this is your actual profession, so I would avoid gaming laptops.  Gaming laptops are more a ""can do that kind of stuff on a budget"", vs dedicated machines.  You can spec those out with quaddro graphics cards, but that gets pricey. or you can get them with RTX cards for cheaper.  Still, the macbook pro with M1 is no slouch. You would be doing yourself a disservice by not even looking at it (No, I don't own an iphone either) but I think it's worth looking into."
52418,best hiphop album,It's a contentious argument
67449,axios alternatives reddit,"> the bonus, however, is you get symmetry between front-end and back-end code.

Well for the most part yes. There are [some differences](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/LIMITS.md).

Not really seeing how that's a different argument vs using axios which works on both front-end and back-end code too though?"
51445,best iphone case,It’s a little bigger than the silicone cases but I don’t think it’s too bulky at all. Check their website they have good pictures of it on there
7877,best laptop for general use,Thanks a lot for picking this up! I'll edit it.
29086,best calendar tool,Calendars 5 by Readdle. Is the only one can properly manage google calendar notification
27123,best board games,"There are so many corporations and so many project cards that you can play it a dozen times and it will still feel (mostly) fresh every time. There are tons of ways to leverage your inherent abilities and starting cards to win. 

It's one of those games where you typically have 3-4 things you can ""almost"" do but can't quite finish them all in your turn so you wait until next turn, when you get another few things you want to do, and repeat. It keeps you engaged all the way through."
3484,best college for research,"Emory is ranked 21. Everything above Emory is top 20. People don't see NYU as the same because it's ranked 30.  You cannot combine rankings as the methodologies for each one are vastly different. If you combine them you essentially aren't controlling for anything.

( And how would this work if for instance GAtech is 35 on US news and 71 on WSJ...Why is it only 41 then?)"
42315,movies like Inception,I'm gonna say what any man with two penises would say when his tailor asks him if he dresses to the right or to the left...yes.
66439,best soccer team in the world,Have switched coaches now! Solbakken should be a good fit
70672,best movies with a cool twist,"I watched the prestige for the first time at college during finals week with a group of people. We finished the movie, I looked at everyone and said “I’m going to start it over from the beginning if that’s okay with everyone.” And we immediately rewatched it"
3728,best college for research,"Definitely true. Rankings of universties are very flawed for many reasons. But, because 'top 1000' universities is such a broad category, I think it accurately displays where the world's best universities are roughly located. E.g. because American universities often score higher than they should, a European university might come in lower but it's still gonna make the top 1000 of course! Then again, it was of course to be expected that this was the U.S.A., western Europe and China."
26471,best politician,Lack of a moral compass
