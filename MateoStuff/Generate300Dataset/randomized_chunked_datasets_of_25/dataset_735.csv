Its more of best value for gaming at these price ranges, as let's be real, the 11900k and 5950x aren't listed cause they are priced higher than the rest here.

31227,"I really enjoyed Costa Rica - except for San Jose (one of the worst cities we visited - of the 75 odd we did around the world!!) but even it had some interesting communities. The towns we enjoyed were Monteverde, Uvita and San Isidro del General but never got to the north or coffee growing highlands. 
One thing I have learned is that people live in communities and even the “worst” countries/cities have some great communities. Most country related issues have little impact on ones day to day lifestyle.",best country to live in

Partially because I *LOVE* Palms Springs, but also the room was clean, updated, and had a kitchenette which we didn't expect. It is a little farther out of the way from downtown area, but I liked that it was quieter because of the location.
