10186,"There are some good ideas in this thread on what to look for in pencils (Faber-Castel and the like), but do yourself a favor and invest in pencil-extenders and kneaded erasers if you do go pencil-heavy.
Kneaded erasers tend to not leave any shavings, and also can be molded into whatever shape you desire. Best of luck!",best pencil for drawing

23790,"Gran Turismo Sport, without a doubt.

The graphics are insanely good and the cars actually feel like they’ve got weight added to them unlike Project Cars 2, which makes me feel like I’m playing with Hotwheels orsomething.

I adore the car sounds in PC2 though, they’re much better than GT Sport right now but they -are- improving.

Updates are free, you get a car everyday for doing the daily challenge (although chances are they’re shit).

GT Sport also has support from the FIA and you can ‘sign’ contracts with certain constructors to drive for them. Fictional, of course. Still a sweet feature.",best car racing video game

33790,"No, the car determines class, not the price tag.

A cheap plastic and poorly fitted model 3 interior rules it out of the luxury market completely.

Since the SS was discontinued there really isn't anything in the Tesla 3's class anymore, at least not in the US market. Perhaps the new Mazda 3 or a few VW's, Maxima?, Sti, Stinger.",best electric car
29326,"I technically don't have a console but I'm planning to buy one. I've used the PS4 and the UI is good. I've seen that the Xbox one x is more powerful but the PS has more exclusives, and it seems that Xbox has backwards comparability which I hear is coming to the PS5. So I'm a PC user. Just a regular PC with ok gaming. I want to make a good decision on which console I want to buy so I've come you console users who have years of experience to help me make a good decision.
Thank you in advance for you time.",best game console
