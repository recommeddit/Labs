10186,best pencil for drawing,"There are some good ideas in this thread on what to look for in pencils (Faber-Castel and the like), but do yourself a favor and invest in pencil-extenders and kneaded erasers if you do go pencil-heavy.
Kneaded erasers tend to not leave any shavings, and also can be molded into whatever shape you desire. Best of luck!"
25000,best spiderman actor,You can have spiderman and not replay him getting his powers for the third time. At this point everybody already knows the story so i appreciated the new one kind of jumping right into the action
4563,best text editor,"Nano never gets the love. I'm always using nano, or VSCode for anything more."
23790,best car racing video game,"Gran Turismo Sport, without a doubt.

The graphics are insanely good and the cars actually feel like they’ve got weight added to them unlike Project Cars 2, which makes me feel like I’m playing with Hotwheels orsomething.

I adore the car sounds in PC2 though, they’re much better than GT Sport right now but they -are- improving.

Updates are free, you get a car everyday for doing the daily challenge (although chances are they’re shit).

GT Sport also has support from the FIA and you can ‘sign’ contracts with certain constructors to drive for them. Fictional, of course. Still a sweet feature."
52155,best iphone case,Been using a spigen case on my Xs for three years.
39716,best podcast for biologists,Hope you get a chance to cover chromothripsis!
65583,best phone service company,Verizon hands down
63131,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,I honestly use zebra because it has many features
68323,best science fiction novel,"I think they're all great, as long as they are Frank. Stay far, far away from the others.

And God Emperor is one of my favorite books. Didn't like it when I was in high school, but it really clicked with me as an adult."
1059,best ice cream flavor,"I work at Baskin robbins so this might be heavily biased, but my favorites are love potion, trick Oreo treat, winter white chocolate and cotton candy!"
66147,best soccer team in the world,"This may be true since we know Chelsea managed to get a 0-0 draw at Camp Nou, then we all know what happened at Stamford Bridge, fuck I shouldn't remind myself"
1527,best ice cream flavor,I wonder where I can get a purple yam....

ANGERY"
33790,best electric car,"No, the car determines class, not the price tag.

A cheap plastic and poorly fitted model 3 interior rules it out of the luxury market completely.

Since the SS was discontinued there really isn't anything in the Tesla 3's class anymore, at least not in the US market. Perhaps the new Mazda 3 or a few VW's, Maxima?, Sti, Stinger."
29326,best game console,"I technically don't have a console but I'm planning to buy one. I've used the PS4 and the UI is good. I've seen that the Xbox one x is more powerful but the PS has more exclusives, and it seems that Xbox has backwards comparability which I hear is coming to the PS5. So I'm a PC user. Just a regular PC with ok gaming. I want to make a good decision on which console I want to buy so I've come you console users who have years of experience to help me make a good decision.
Thank you in advance for you time."

I got a bottle of this at a pub in north Ireland and it was the most delicious water I’d ever tasted."

19852,best workout music,System of a Down
34264,best NFL player,He’s not better than garrett
72406,best keyboard switches,"Yeah, blues are super noisy. If you like that tactile feel on the blues, but don't want noise, browns or another tactile switch are great. If you want something smooth, linear are perfect. There are some great, inexpensive keyboards out there that are hotswap capable, some even sub $100. Check out r/mechanicalkeyboards for more info on boards and switches. It's a bit of an expensive hobby once you start, but it's super fun."
46416,best trick or treating candy,Bunch of Hershey bars. It was 11:30 and the house was sort of behind other houses so she got very little visitors
71653,best movies with a cool twist,"Man, I hate that beyaaatch :<"
