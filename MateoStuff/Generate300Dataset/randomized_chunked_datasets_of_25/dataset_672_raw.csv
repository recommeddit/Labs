One of the reasons that grey/greige has been popular is because it's neutral.  If you paint it a non-harsh white that would serve the same purpose and the owner can imagine their own color choice in there.
"The last kingdom is pretty good, more or less the same theme of Vikings"
"Love my pair (love that they carry smaller sizes that fit my face better). Also, great customer service. They sent me a pair with a loose screw (tried to get it to stay in, was screwing it back in every other day near the end) that fell apart about 6 months after I got them and even though there's no warranty they sent me a replacement no questions asked."
I just finished The Sheep Look Up. I feel like I just need to lie down for a day or 10
My 9 years old GE Cafe fridge still running.  Had to replace the motherboard once but that's OK.
This joke hadn't been funny in years.
"was gonna say what about opening files then i realized ""xdg-open"""
Incorrect!  Posthumous awards were never allowed.  The 1974 rule merely clarifies how recent a person's death can be before they become ineligible.
"I did this. I really loved getting to study a language I'd wanted to learn for a long time, but now that I'm graduated, having to explain I'm not fluent in the thing I fucking majored in is kind of even worse than having one of the ""generic"" degrees people tend to look down on that are easier to explain away, like psychology and communications.

If I could, I'd go back and tell 17-year-old me to do differently! But, I can't. :/"
"Does this ranking takes into account subdomains as well? If so, surely arch is that high because of the wiki"
"I like Disgraceful the most though but all of his are good! 

I forgot to also mention Jim Jefferies and Dave Chapelle!!"

How much always sunny did you watch? It takes a few episodes to get Into it but once Frank arrives it's comedy gold
I always try to grab a NY Times every day at school and at least skim it. I was away from campus last semester and I definitely missed it. Even though I could access it all online I usually don't go out of my way to do that.
"I hope so, it really is that important."
"Pi√±ata, Bandana, Alfredo all three are good albums"
That phone gonna be thick af with a flush case
"I'm mixed race and significantly lighter-skinned than my father. I once went with him to a really fancy hotel and the bellman on the way up was asking me a shitload of questions... but like about pokemon (this would've been at the height of ""pokemania"" in the mid-late 90's). I wonder if he was trying to suss out if I was being trafficked or if he was just a Gen X dude who was unusually into pokemon."
Wouldn't that mean natural selection would create more strains that are better at embedding themselves into nooks and crannies?
Yeah I really love it. When I read the southern reach series it felt like it was trying to replicate its magic
"The difference between Apple earbuds and a pair of $100 cans will blow you away, especially if you've never experienced ""real"" cans. Check headphone.com or head-fi for some great recommendations into this entry level price point for audiophiles headphones. Stay away form Bose or Dr Dre. Look into Audio Technica, Etymotic, Beyerdynamic, Sennheiser, Shure, and others."
"Mr. Mercedes is scratching the itch for oddly weird crime drama, like True detective. i will admit i am only about halfway through season 1 but it is really good, in my opinion."
"Dead cells,
Stardew Valley,
Hyperlight drifter,
Genshin Impact."
