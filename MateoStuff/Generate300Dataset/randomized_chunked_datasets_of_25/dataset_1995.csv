12371,best gifts for mom,I had a baby on my mom's birthday one year.... that was a hit.
39134,best web browser,"Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of suggestions for Edge, which took me by surprise considering I've been avoiding it like the plague since the system started shoving it into all the built-in systems.
Kind of interesting how many suggestions there are eventhough so far I haven't gotten anything concrete aside from Edge and ""Brave"" (Which I never heard of before)"
13106,best gifts for mom,"I know it may sound superficial, but I bought her a TV. 2 of her 3 kids are off to school now so she has alot more time to herself which she spends watching various TV shows and copius amounts of Netflix. She still has a gigantic CRT monstrosity and complains about it constantly. Last year, I bought her a blu-ray player and a HDMI to composite converter and she thought I was some kind of wizard. Now I'm in a more financially stable position so I can give her the whole experience. 

Meanwhile, my Dad cheated on her and blamed her for it. He's getting a T-shirt."
31078,best country to live in,Vancouver checks off practically everything you listed there
11108,best backpack for college,"Everybody is suggesting way to expensive options for a backpack which will sit on a piece of tile. Get a Jansport. Cheap, durable, lifetime warranty. Of course if you want to throw money on a style. Go ahead"
32602,best vacation resort,"No matter the location, look it up on Google Maps with Street view. Many brochures and websites make the places that you want to look crowded, such as bars and dance floors, crowded, and places you don't want crowded, such as pools & beaches, without few people. There's even [new apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchretouch/id373311252?mt=8) out that allow people to instantly ""photoshop"" their vacation photos. 

Starting here is great, word of mouth is the best. Personally, I'd go for the off-season packages."

46556,best trick or treating candy,"man I feel weird pride over the nerd thing, I feel like this state knows what's up"
31168,best country to live in,Canada!
15875,best sunglasses for fashion,Rayban 4140s which are the Retro Wayfarers I believe.
22838,best celebrity,"Morgan Freeman. 
We're both from the same state (Mississippi). I was having lunch near his home town when I noticed him. He took the time to talk to me, despite my epic fan grin, and paid for my food before he left. 
Best lunch I ever had.

So in conclusion I met God. 

Edit: Corrected the word I forgot to type. Oops! That's what I get for doing it on my phone. :)"
45448,best gaming system,"The exclusive titles for the PS4 and switch are a huge reason I have both. Games like Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Uncharted, Last of Us 2, Nier. Those are all enough for me to get a console rather than a PC. Also, a bunch of my friends have PS4s so that works out.

I think the biggest aspect though is the price of entry. I know that PC gaming is cheaper overall, but it's easier for me to shell out 300-400 at a time rather than 700-800 for a PC."
25649,best cricket teams of all time,"Adam Gilchrist at number 6, Warne at 7 and Lee at 8 must have been the most disheartening tail any ever bowled to. Once you'd finally seen off Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Waugh and Martyn you had those three to deal with. One their day they were worth 300. How can it not be the best side of all time with that going for it?"

19991,best workout music,FEAR FACTORY - SELF BIAS RESISTOR
52958,best hiphop album,"I'll probably get downvoted to hell for this, but I'm not at all impressed with anything that Eminem's put out since Relapse until now either. 

Recovery was an average album & TMMLP2 only did well because of the name attached to it IMHO."
29914,best money managing app,$84 per year (7 per month)
41918,movies like Inception,"Whoops. My bad. I'm one of those crazy people that still has a DVD subscription. 

Also, auto correct definitely got me on Memento."
