39134,"Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of suggestions for Edge, which took me by surprise considering I've been avoiding it like the plague since the system started shoving it into all the built-in systems.
Kind of interesting how many suggestions there are eventhough so far I haven't gotten anything concrete aside from Edge and ""Brave"" (Which I never heard of before)",best web browser
13106,"I know it may sound superficial, but I bought her a TV. 2 of her 3 kids are off to school now so she has alot more time to herself which she spends watching various TV shows and copius amounts of Netflix. She still has a gigantic CRT monstrosity and complains about it constantly. Last year, I bought her a blu-ray player and a HDMI to composite converter and she thought I was some kind of wizard. Now I'm in a more financially stable position so I can give her the whole experience. 

Meanwhile, my Dad cheated on her and blamed her for it. He's getting a T-shirt.",best gifts for mom

32602,"No matter the location, look it up on Google Maps with Street view. Many brochures and websites make the places that you want to look crowded, such as bars and dance floors, crowded, and places you don't want crowded, such as pools & beaches, without few people. There's even [new apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchretouch/id373311252?mt=8) out that allow people to instantly ""photoshop"" their vacation photos.

45448,"The exclusive titles for the PS4 and switch are a huge reason I have both. Games like Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Uncharted, Last of Us 2, Nier. Those are all enough for me to get a console rather than a PC. Also, a bunch of my friends have PS4s so that works out.

I think the biggest aspect though is the price of entry. I know that PC gaming is cheaper overall, but it's easier for me to shell out 300-400 at a time rather than 700-800 for a PC.",best gaming system
