45898,best trick or treating candy,"Sour Patch Kids. And none of that watermelon shit, I mean the originals. The best."
23664,best car racing video game,Because it's shit. These developers are complete assholes. They tried to do two simulators before that but they weren't good enough so sim community didn't play them. Then they shifted to arcade and this time arcade community ignored them. They just don't have a clue on how to make racing games.
46035,best trick or treating candy,Just leave a bowl of candy outside. It'll be all gone by the fourth visitor
65057,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"I lived in Ventura form 2016 to this year, I grew up in Ojai. Beacon coffee is just a huge disappointment in every way, I've been to both spots. I'm not into poorly roasted and poorly prepared espresso served by a man bun. What can I say, I'm the worst coffee snob I know besides my bf. We suck."
71608,best movies with a cool twist,I feel like that is going to ruin the point of a twist ending if you know there is a twist coming.
13475,best spreadsheet editor,"+1 for libreoffice, also hate to be the local library shill, but library will have excel for free use, and often will help you find a job. I had to learn excel for a Analyst job, as I only used SQL Server and tools for that, and a job required excel ( two steps back, but hey if their paying..), just went to the library and r/excel and binged for 3 days, got the job. Excel macros will land you jobs for sure."

53575,best medicine for a cold,"Also remember to stay hydrated when taking most meds. Very much so with those who help loosen that phlegm. Like the one who advertises with the little green mucus man lol. Mainlynstay hydrated not with sodas, or sports drink. Try water, hot tea, lemon water. Oh and honey is great  for relieving a sore throat. Only if you are over age of 1. No babies. Cough drops tend to help but you take or suck on too many you may get diarrhea. And try a steamer to add comfort for stuffiness."
12088,best gifts for dad,"Exactly. If a guy is really into shaving (I don't know why someone would be really into shaving, but to each his own) get him shaving stuff. If he really likes playing the guitar, get him guitar stuff. If he likes sci-fi, get him sci-fi schwag. If he likes knick-knacks and figures, get him knick-knacks and figurines.

Pretty much the best gift for anyone is something they like.

*Edit:* Based on the responses, guys really hate when you buy them things for their hobby. It turns out they really just want shaving shit.

^(I hope no one in my life reads this thread and just gets me shaving shit for the rest of my life.)"

68550,best science fiction novel,"I think you’ve just inadvertently given me the reason why I don’t think I like sci fi as much as fantasy. 

I have trouble reading books that are older. Of the language is ever slightly dated I just find it hard to engage. Whenever I try to read many of the books on this list inevitably put them down. I have realised that I just don’t hear that much about newer books. I recently read Adrian Tchaikovsky’s children of time and I fucking loved it."
