42944,"You say you want True Crime but then you don't list any True Crime shows...

I Am A Killer is a great docuseries. It deals with the overarching question of the existence of the Death Penalty and whether death sentences are always justified, but unlike a lot of true crime out there, there's no narration or interviewer telling you what to think. Each episode is structured carefully so that information about each crime is revealed in a way that creates a compelling story and challenges your preconceived ideas about the crime.

In a lot of True Crime shows the murder remains unsolved, but in this show we know who the murderer is and we get to see interviews with them and understand where their head was at, as well as who they are as a person now, so it is a really interesting look at whether or not rehabilitation is possible.",best detective show

8579,"My dentist showed me my before and after photos about a year after purchasing and using one (on their recommendation) and the results were undeniable. Plus, cleanings took much less time because there was much less plaque to scrape off. 

Mine is a sonic care and the price has come down a lot. Gums are healthier, teeth are cleaner and stronger...I've had to buy maybe 3 heads in the past year to replace older ones from Amazon but they most definitely work.

Plus, if you're ever hesitant about brushing, just think of the investment you made and it's a little more convincing to do it twice a day.",best toothpaste

And the cryptic crossword in the ""i"" is about the right sort of level for me (equivalent to Telegraph cryptics IMO, so not up there with the impossibility of a lot of the Guardian ones)",best newspapers to read

And I remember reading that at least zinc helped end a cold sooner if taken early during the course of infection.",best medicine for a cold
