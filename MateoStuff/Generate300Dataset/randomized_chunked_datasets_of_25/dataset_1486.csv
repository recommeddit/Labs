45379,best gaming system,"I've really been enjoying breath of the wild on switch, however God of war and Spiderman look great. So ps4s exclusives, Xbox's controllers and Switch's motion controls. Probably ps4 as #1 And Xbox as #2 but switches games are really good too so... send help"

42944,best detective show,"You say you want True Crime but then you don't list any True Crime shows...

I Am A Killer is a great docuseries. It deals with the overarching question of the existence of the Death Penalty and whether death sentences are always justified, but unlike a lot of true crime out there, there's no narration or interviewer telling you what to think. Each episode is structured carefully so that information about each crime is revealed in a way that creates a compelling story and challenges your preconceived ideas about the crime.

In a lot of True Crime shows the murder remains unsolved, but in this show we know who the murderer is and we get to see interviews with them and understand where their head was at, as well as who they are as a person now, so it is a really interesting look at whether or not rehabilitation is possible."

10480,best suitcase lock,"I have the oldest piece of crap samsonite hard shell suitcase, one if the latches is broke and I use duct tape to keep it closed. Everytime I check it, it gains a sticker from TSA with new tape over my tape cause it's obviously suspicious. But to the baggage handler thief it looks like a total waste of time, and where would they get the TSA tape to replace the tampering."
73495,best battery bank,"The dual ports are essential for me, as I want to be able to charge my phone & inReach Mini at the same time."

8214,best toothpaste,Oooooooooooo
8579,best toothpaste,"My dentist showed me my before and after photos about a year after purchasing and using one (on their recommendation) and the results were undeniable. Plus, cleanings took much less time because there was much less plaque to scrape off. 

Mine is a sonic care and the price has come down a lot. Gums are healthier, teeth are cleaner and stronger...I've had to buy maybe 3 heads in the past year to replace older ones from Amazon but they most definitely work.

Plus, if you're ever hesitant about brushing, just think of the investment you made and it's a little more convincing to do it twice a day."
38670,best newspapers to read,"With you on that. ""i"" is the only dead-tree newspaper that I read now. It's also (I believe) the only UK newspaper whose circulation is increasing year-on-year, although admittedly it's got a very low starting point.

And the cryptic crossword in the ""i"" is about the right sort of level for me (equivalent to Telegraph cryptics IMO, so not up there with the impossibility of a lot of the Guardian ones)"
54006,best medicine for a cold,"I know it isn't worth much for proof, but before I started doing that, I got bronchitis once a year.  Since I started four years ago, I haven't had a cold move into bronchitis.  The vitamin C might prevent a secondary infection from starting up that causes the bronchitis.  And I remember reading that at least zinc helped end a cold sooner if taken early during the course of infection."
