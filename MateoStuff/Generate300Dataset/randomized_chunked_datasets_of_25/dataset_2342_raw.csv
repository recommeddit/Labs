Thanks for the answer. Why not? Isn't it easier to deal with one type?
"I recommend investing in an egg cooker.  Makes cooking them to desired doneness very easy and they tend to peel easier as well.  Also, when peeling them put them under cold water and peel there.  All shells will float and they come off way easier.

Yeet."
"Danger 5 is pretty damn funny, despite being short."
[The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/headphones/) has already done all of this research for you. I find their recommendations to be spot on.
"For me the only item on the list Iâ€™d  might be interested in is the data science job one. By the look of it, all Of the others are focused on learning specific techniques and I donâ€™t need a list to find a good book in machine learning. 

I think what I was hoping to get were some books outlining and discussing trends and developments in the industry, asking interesting questions or talking about data science in a more abstract level then code. 


But thatâ€™s just my opinion! Might be because I donâ€™t feel like there are many resources with those topics in mind (glad to be proven wrong!)"
I think the best is honestly to pimp a butterfly it just has so much artistic value but my favorite is the Marshall Mathers lp.
"It is part of my podcast [Ocean Science Radio](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio) but the ""Ocean Lovin"" series was a 6 part series that starts with [Lobsters and Seahorses](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio/ocean-lovin-part-1) and ended with [Whales, Sharks and Dolphins](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio/ocean-lovin-6) (though my personal favorite are the [Osedax worms](https://soundcloud.com/ocean-science-radio/ocean-lovin-3).)"
"Depends if you are sensitive to gore/horror or not, I suppose. Personally I'm not, so I wasn't really scared/didn't scream ( got caught off guard a few times tho ), but my mom who was with me at the time was scared to death. ( talking about the maze thing, forgot name )"
"I have a unit like this and it makes my sink leak like crazy. I just checked and there's a large puddle underneath. The sink leaks at the base whenever I flip the switch to use the filter - so it's probably related to the aerator, but it does it with every type I've tried."
"Cocktail:  Blue Electric (1 part Blue Curacao, 2 Parts Vodka, 3-5 parts lemonade)--its a refreshing cocktails that's sweet, but drinkably so 

""Boring"" Cocktail:  Screwdriver/Cape Cod (2-4 parts orange/cranberry juice to 1 part vodka)--easy to make, easy to adjust the strength of/dilute

Beer:  Negro Modelo--not too grainy of a taste

Wine:  Pinot Grigio--mild flavour, goes with just about everything, not too sweet"
Nomade by Chloe. It was the perfume I wore on my wedding day and whenever I wear it my husband says it makes him really happy
"Not true. Iâ€™m a dentist. Just like people are supposed to diet and exercise, many donâ€™t brush and floss as often or as thoroughly. Despite coaching people relentlessly on how to be better, many just wonâ€™t do anything until they have to or until itâ€™s too late. It makes my freaking day when someone shows up and their teeth are gorgeous, I legit get giddy and tell them how great theyâ€™re doing- one less person I have to preach to. 

Any toothpaste with fluoride, sensodyne if your teeth hurt with cold water. But above all else, get an electric toothbrush. Spend the $100 and get a sonicare or an oral-b and floss at night. I honestly believe itâ€™s the cheapest and best investment you can make for long term dental health. Oh! And donâ€™t forget to brush along the gum line!"
"Awesome, thanks. The red devil was one of the models I was considering. I have a red devil RX 480 now and it has been great. The reason I'm upgrading is for better 1440p as well as a more future proof system."

Anyone know of an alternative?
