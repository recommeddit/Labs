"**PROS:** Most people don't realize how versatile a political science major can be depending on where you specialize. A B.A. in political science can be a good basis for Law School, government jobs, academia, and more. 

* Law School: Political Science can make you knowledgeable in American or International laws. Very good background to have. **UPDATE:** Its been pointed out that political science is becoming all too common in law school application pools. I  take these points with a grain of salt since there are less law school applicants these days and I do not believe the major is out for the count, but then again, i'm not a current law student or lawyer so I am not the expert on this. Take that as you will. But, as others have said, diversifying your undergraduate education is a major plus when applying and double majoring in something else will improve your chances.

* Government: Almost any Federal Department (Or State or Local) will have jobs for Political Science majors. Depending on the department you may want to double major or have a minor. State Department for instance has the Foreign Service (check out /r/foreignservice) if you want to be a diplomat and that will require foreign language skills. Likewise, an economics double major or minor will be useful for almost any department.

* Political Campaigning: A political science major with strong people skills, creative thinking and a sense of strategy could make a career out of this. Keep in mind, it's not an easy world to break into. You'll most likely start small working for the campaigns of State officials. If you can land an internship in DC and get your name out there, you'll open a lot of doors into high level positions. **UPDATE:** As others have pointed out, you do not necessarily NEED to have BA in Poli-Sci to land a campaign job. You can start off as a volunteer or campaign staffer during your education and later on, experience becomes the most important element. In addition, you don't have to go to DC to be ultimately successful if you prefer to work elsewhere. It is your call.

* Academia: This will require a PHD and a strong sense of discipline to get to (4 years of undergrad, 4-6 years of grad school). Academia is a tough job market since there's only so many renowned universities looking for professors of certain subjects, but if you get into a Top 20 program, your odds are fine. 
Beyond universities, you could land a career at a DC Think-Tank and formulate policy. The Federal government also hires PHDs into different departments to do consulting or research although these positions are also few. Once again, you're going to want to get into a Top 20 program to break into most of these careers but if academia turns out to be something your really interested in and really want to do, then go for it.

* Private Sector & Lobbying: Companies hire political advisors/consultants to assist the company with the legal and political side of regulations and to try to influence legislation to be favorable to the company's interest. 

* Non-Government Organizations/Non-Profits: Doctors without Borders, Red Cross, and so forth hire political science majors. 


**CONS:** Most well-paying political science careers will require some form of graduate school and experience in other areas. Just straight political science won't get you far unless you're going straight academia or non-profit. Thus, I recommend the following.


* You Need to Get to Know Your Professors: Your Political Science Department will be the key to getting your foot in the door in various places. Whether that is DC internships, graduate school or elsewhere, you will need your Department's help.


* **YOU NEED TO DOUBLE MAJOR**: Like I said earlier, straight political science won't help you outside of academia and NGOs. Pairing political science with a business or economics major can open up doors. Statistics is also a favorable double major, as many graduate schools and public policy jobs want you to have experience with different research methods. Language and Regional Studies (Asia, Europe, Middle East, etc) can be useful if you want to pursue a career in international affairs but these are riskier to pursue. If you take anything away from this post, keep this in mind: MAKE YOURSELF MARKETABLE. More skills, more talents, and more experience will make you stand out compared to other political science majors.


* You're Going to Have to Bust Your Balls: These ideal job positions for Political Science are reserved for the best and brightest. C's may get degrees but policy-makers and graduate schools are going to throw your resume in the trash. You're going to need to shoot for the best possible grades. In addition, you're going to need to stand out as best as possible. Join Honor Societies, win scholarships, hell if you can pull it off, try to get published. While I listed a lot of different job opportunities you can pursue, its not like engineering or accounting. They aren't just handing out jobs to anyone. You have to stand out.


* Everyone and Their Mother is Going to Give You Their Opinion: I try to not mention I study political science as everyone assumes I study American politics and then the torrent of political opinions sprays out. Its really annoying.


* Finally, You're Not Going to Be Insta-Rich: While there are very well paying jobs for political scientists out there, they are few. If you're dedicated to going into political science, you need to accept that the hot-shot finance major or the mechanical engineer working at Lockheed-Martin is going to make more then you. You'll need to define success by your own standards on this career path. Landing a decent political science job can allow you to live comfortably but don't expect to be earning enough money to be able to afford whatever /r/malefashionadvice is gushing about that isn't Uniqlo.


**EDIT:** Updated some points on Law School and on Political Campaigning after some comments pointed out things I missed or misinterpreted. I apologize for the inaccuracies and invite everyone to continue commenting with their experiences.

**UPDATE:** Hi guys, I appreciate that a lot of you are messaging me or commenting here asking for career advice, but I cant give you answers on every possible degree combo or whether your internship at [X] will give you a leg up for pursuing [Y]. I don't want to give you information that may be false so please I encourage you all to ask others in the thread who are in that career field or ask your professors at university. Thank you."

"Maybe it's odd, but I found theory much easier to grasp once I'd learned a bit of guitar -- not that I'm any sort of expert!  Piano and guitar work in different ways, gabrielsab's comment above was pretty spot on about the trade-offs.  I think I know enough to explain.

Theory lesson 0: What it means when someone says ""We're playing in C Major.""  C is the key, Major is the mode.  Together they define a set of notes that are going to make sense to play together.  Piano makes it easy to stay in one key and change the mode.  Guitar makes it easy to stay in one mode and change the key.

With a guitar you can learn a chord shape or a scale shape and play the same chord or scale in different keys just by moving that shape up and down the neck.  On a piano, if you want to play in C major you can do so with only the white keys, but if you want to play in F major or any other major key you'll need to learn a different combination of white and black keys.  The trade-off for this is also the reason for it: If you stay in the key of C on a piano, you can play in other modes by continuing to use all the white keys, but resolving your melodies to a different note (e.g. beginning and ending a melody with F, using all the white keys, will be a phrase in F Lydian).

It's really easy to just stay in the minor mode and change key whenever you want on a guitar, but to change your mode freely you'll have to learn different shapes representing different modes.  On piano it's easy to stay in one key and change the mode, but to play in different keys you'll have to learn the shapes of the keys.  I think that, whichever instrument you choose, it would probably be helpful to play the other as well once in a while.  When I started learning about music, I was taught piano, but I was absolutely rubbish at it.  Later I learned bass guitar, and that seemed a lot easier.  Now it's helping me learn to play 6-string guitar, so I'm encountering chords again (note: it's still important to learn your chords when playing bass, you just generally don't play all the notes at once), and going back to learn just a bit about piano really gave me a different perspective.

With either, if you learn all the shapes corresponding to keys or modes on either instrument, you can do many of the same things.  A guitar can play six notes at once while a piano can play ten, where having five on each hand allows you to more naturally play two things at once, but a guitar can slide and bend notes and if you're into rock and roll you'll appreciate being able to play melodies with power chords in any key by holding one simple shape, as well as the portability and the powerful sound of a good amp.  If you prefer classical music, piano will probably be a better tool for understanding that world.  Those are the major trade-offs, but learning either or both would be worthwhile."

"As a stay at home mom, I like things that make my life at home easier. A spa day is nice, a romantic night in a hotel sounds amazing, but these things are temporary. I asked my husband for a Dyson personally. I have all tile floors and sweeping them everyday is a pain, it's much easier and faster to vacuum the floors. He thought I was crazy for asking for such a mundane thing as a gift, but it honestly has made life easier and given me extra time to spend with LO, and that to me is a great gift. Not saying run out and buy her an awesome vacuum, but ask maybe if there is something you could buy/she wants that could make life at home easier on a daily basis."

"I have run extensively in all three. I hope I can shed some light.

- if you like light and bouncy, Epic React Flyknit is a great shoe. Make sure it has enough volume in the toes and forefoot. If you have a higher instep or a wider foot it might be too shallow or narrow. Even though the flyknit fits pretty tight it does flex quite a bit to accommodate foot shape. The React foam is proprietary cushioning tech that feels unlike any other foam I have used in a running shoe.

- I retired my LunarEpic Low Flyknit last year after about 100 Miles. Fit too narrow and was just a little too “mushy” feeling for me. I also can’t stand the outsole. It picks up small pebbles way too much. This shoe is discontinued going forward and replaced by the Epic React, even though it’s a very different shoe.

- Pegasus 35 just launched, so I have limited experience with this one. Loved the feel underfoot. This is good if you want a little more support in your shoe. It’s still light and fast. I feel like the tongue comes up a little high though. It bothered a bit on my last few runs.

Do you normally run on a neutral support shoe? Make sure these options have enough support for your foot and gait. Also, shape matters. Nike tends to run narrow in these styles so keep that in mind.

If you can visit your LRS (local running store) I’d recommend it. They can give you advice and offer solutions outside these three styles."
