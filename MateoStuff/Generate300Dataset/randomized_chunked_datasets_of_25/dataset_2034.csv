31284,"I'm an Australian. So I'm voting Australia here, with some supported logic.

Firstly, for you war folks out there, we are placed in one of the most strategic positions in the world for fighting any of the eastern countries by boat or air. 

Secondly, for you economy people out there, we have the most abundant resources of precious stones, fuel, and coal in the southern hemisphere, and in the top 10 for the world.

Thirdly, 93% of our people live on the coast, and the temperature various between (on average) 5 degrees Celcius and 40, depending on where you live, so if you prefer certain climates, we do cater for all that.

Fourthly, our healthcare system is amazing. We recently pretty much bullied our government into stopping them charging a $20 fee to see the doctor. If you get sick, it's practically for free as part of our Medicare fund.

We have centrelink, which is pretty much free money. Australia doesn't actually have many homeless people, and by that, I mean I've seen 3 in my entire life. One of them is voluntarily homeless.

Fifthly/sixthly, for you geeks out there, we generally get games before other people, for you Nintendo fans, we have both of the New 3DS'. 

Seventhly, the culture is amazing. We have so many different people from all over the world, and we just love them. There is always going to be racism, sexism, and every nasty atrocity. But we look out for each other in Australia. Your mate is your mate, and he won't sue you for sneezing on him.

Now Australia does have sucky bits. It doesn't snow in 90% of the land, we sometimes get movies later than other people, and yes, we don't have Netflix. 

But hey, our accents. And try and find an ugly Aussie. I dare you.",best country to live in
