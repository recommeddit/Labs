37856,best Marvel movie,"I think it may be the best origin movie for me. Though I did also love Dr. Strange, Iron Man, and Black Panther..

It doesn't beat out some other movies like Winter Soldier, Civil War, Infinity War and some others though"

49148,best gaming monitor,"I bought the Asus initially however had issues with the display going to sleep when connected to pc through DisplayPort, and wouldn’t turn back on unless unplugged. Other people on reddit have reported this issue. 

On top of that I had a Dead Pixel so returned it for the LG. So far no sleep mode issues!"
31089,best country to live in,"Yeah, my ideal would probably be 70-80 degree days year round, including at night. Not sure that exists though, so decided I should be a bit more flexible :P"
41290,best instrument to play,"When I press my mouse on the play button of itunes, a set sound is played. This is clearly not an instrument. I think we agree there is a line somewhere, but disagree on the location of the line. Interesting debate for sure :)

Where would you say the line is drawn?"
9707,best dorm hall at UCSB,There's a separate building not too far away. It's essentially next door; it only sucks if its raining cuz then your clothes get wet.

23509,best car racing video game,"Yeah, I didn't notice it at the time either. I went back to it for a little nostalgia trip, and it is horrendous.

31284,best country to live in,"I'm an Australian. So I'm voting Australia here, with some supported logic.

Firstly, for you war folks out there, we are placed in one of the most strategic positions in the world for fighting any of the eastern countries by boat or air. 

Secondly, for you economy people out there, we have the most abundant resources of precious stones, fuel, and coal in the southern hemisphere, and in the top 10 for the world.

Thirdly, 93% of our people live on the coast, and the temperature various between (on average) 5 degrees Celcius and 40, depending on where you live, so if you prefer certain climates, we do cater for all that.

Fourthly, our healthcare system is amazing. We recently pretty much bullied our government into stopping them charging a $20 fee to see the doctor. If you get sick, it's practically for free as part of our Medicare fund.

We have centrelink, which is pretty much free money. Australia doesn't actually have many homeless people, and by that, I mean I've seen 3 in my entire life. One of them is voluntarily homeless.

Fifthly/sixthly, for you geeks out there, we generally get games before other people, for you Nintendo fans, we have both of the New 3DS'. 

Seventhly, the culture is amazing. We have so many different people from all over the world, and we just love them. There is always going to be racism, sexism, and every nasty atrocity. But we look out for each other in Australia. Your mate is your mate, and he won't sue you for sneezing on him.

Now Australia does have sucky bits. It doesn't snow in 90% of the land, we sometimes get movies later than other people, and yes, we don't have Netflix. 

But hey, our accents. And try and find an ugly Aussie. I dare you."

22631,best celebrity,"*Yes.*  I remember when i first saw that video (I think it was on Digg actually) everyone was commenting about how much of a douche Tom Cruise was being.

In reality he was incredibly cool headed.  None of the ""do you know who I am bullshit.""  Just was pissed at the guy's being a dickhead.  Not only that, you can tell the guy who did the prank *immediately* felt like a child."
