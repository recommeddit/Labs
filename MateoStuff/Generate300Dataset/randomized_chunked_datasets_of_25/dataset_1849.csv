14143,best place to get free books,"I suppose if you want only a tiny fraction of the selection this site has, and you'd rather travel to search and borrow for a short period instead of downloading it in several seconds and keeping it forever, then yeah go to a library."
17053,best iOS game,"I get that. I think it’s a matter of your mindset. You can’t really approach this game with a CIV or 4X mindset. The goal here is just slowly growing your tribe and creating your story. The short term goal should always be amassing cows and wealth, along with gaining renown. The long term goal of the game is gaining enough wealth and renown to eventually begin the process of becoming a king of a combined tribal kingdom. 

Also, a lot of this game is trial and error, you never know how the events shake out."
4947,best home improvement store,"Well in the south there’s only two places to go, Lowe’s and Home Depot and both kinda suck. Once I went to a place called Menards up north and that’s how I found out you can actually buy wood that’s not pine. Didn’t even know you could do that. All this time I thought you had to mill your own hardwood. But then again the south sucks for everything so not surprised"

31318,best country to live in,"I agree it is a little strange.  I think America is generally a good, maybe the best, place to go if you have something like a rare condition or need for a very specific specialist, who may be more likely to practice in America because they can be paid more.  Looking at things like life expectancies, efficiency of the system, or access to services, though, it seems that other countries are doing better."
3251,best webcamera,"You can see my pc [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2L2fyk). It's worth about $800. But you could get it cheaper by removing an SSD, getting a cheaper Case. Not getting an aftermarket cooler, etc, etc.  Also Im not including mouse/keyboard, monitor, etc.
