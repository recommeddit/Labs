3956,"I received a degree from The University of Maryland University College online a couple years back, I do not attribute my high pay to the degree, but it is a decent accomplishment. In the eyes of employers, it is that you finished what you started. The degree is in Cybersecurity, coupled with many industry certifications, I make close to 100k in the states, and over 200k overseas contracting. Mind you I am only 26. It is what you make of it. Depends on how far you want to go within your career, and why you are picking an online program. My advice, if you can, go traditional PT. If you are unable, kids, jobs, remote location, then online is a fine runner up.  With all that being said, most of the comments are correct about online for-profit vs. non-profit. Schools like UMUC, are part of the State of Maryland University system, most people won't bat an eye if you but University of Maryland-UC on your resume, there is also College Park, Baltimore and a couple other schools in that system. But places like Phoenix and Virginia College, which or private-for-profit institutions, I would stay away from.",best online college
