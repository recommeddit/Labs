40856,"Guitar, piano, ukulele, and violin are the top of the list. Possibly the cello. Points for saxophone. Harmonica can be good. Anything you can sing along to will automatically win: even if you personally don't sing along to it, *she* can. Cello and violin are harder to sing along to, though not impossible. Hence piano, guitar, and ukulele being your best bets. Brass or woodwind is bad because you have to contort your face to play and will look weird trying to make eye contact with something in your mouth, which puts harmonica and saxophone on shaky ground.

Girls love it because music is very emotional and romance is very emotional and guys are not always the most eloquent at expressing their emotions: music is a great way of expressing how you feel or at least *suggesting* or *hinting* at how you feel without having to say anything specific. It makes whatever positive emotions she's feeling towards you seem elevated and elegant, in the same way that writing her a good love poem would, but in a more familiar medium. So it encourages emotions in her and suggests that you have some good ones too, while also displaying the fact that you are skilled at something. Pantydropping ensues.

And yes, for the record, I'm a girl. None of the guys I've dated could sing or play instruments. You have no idea how depressing this is, because I love to sing and took lessons for years. At least my current boyfriend loves musicals, but despite knowing *Phantom* and *Evita* and such by heart, he can't stay on key, which makes singing duets awkward for me.",best instrument to play
