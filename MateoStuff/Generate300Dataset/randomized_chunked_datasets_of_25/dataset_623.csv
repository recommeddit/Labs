27770,"Recently, since until school starts again i have mornings to myself, i eat soup and a yoghurt. I have to have light breakfasts and i find making a soup therapeutic, and eat the yoghurt while i wait. When i dont have mornings, im a big fan of eggs all kinds of way (currently in love with medium boiled eggs) because theyre either quick to make or i can make up beforehand and give great protein; toast or oatmeal usually go with it because without carbs im hungry in an hour.",best breakfast foods

73455,"I use an Anker PowerCore 10000mAh Power Bank. 181g/6.5oz. I have one of their 10k slim models with two USB-A ports as well. Both have quick charging “IQ” ports and they work very well on my iPhone, Fire and iPad Mini tablets as well as legacy USB devices. 


I find that I don’t need more capacity (read weight/expense) than that for travel. It can charge my phone several times and I consider it backup vs a everyday method of charging. I use a multi port USB charger so I can recharge everything at once when I get back to my lodgings. 


The only reason I would go bigger would be if getting into areas with no reliable electrical service. The cell service probably wouldn’t be good as well, so it’s a toss up.",best battery bank

70557,"You can find careers that pay that much but if you’re not effective it’s not going to last. Then you’ll be stuck with a degree you don’t care for and it’ll be difficult to correct. 

Find what you’re passionate about. At least a field that excites you. I hate to sound like a jerk, but it doesn’t sound like you can coast through college and still pass. And that’s not a bad thing! For me, I slacked off on classes because I didn’t care.  Once I finally found a major I loved, classes were easy because I wanted to learn more about it. Now I’m in a similar field, not making what you want, but that wasn’t my original goal.",best major to study in college

30506,"I don't see Mexico as invading Texas, since at the time it was part of the whole country. Mexico didn't recognize Texas independence until after the Mexican-American War. I apologyse if it sounds like I'm splitting hairs, I'm just very passionate about this period in Texas History. But border Clashes were quite frequent. Texas actually attempted to invade Mexico Twice, The Tampico Expedition, and and invasion of New Mexico. Neither one turned out well for the Texans. It's amazing how this war influenced politics on both sides of the border for years to come. Not just the Civil War in the United States, but two civil Wars and the Revolution in Mexico as well.",best Mexican war to study
