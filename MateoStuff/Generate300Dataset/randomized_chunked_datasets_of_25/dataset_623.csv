27770,best breakfast foods,"Recently, since until school starts again i have mornings to myself, i eat soup and a yoghurt. I have to have light breakfasts and i find making a soup therapeutic, and eat the yoghurt while i wait. When i dont have mornings, im a big fan of eggs all kinds of way (currently in love with medium boiled eggs) because theyre either quick to make or i can make up beforehand and give great protein; toast or oatmeal usually go with it because without carbs im hungry in an hour."

14967,best romantic novel,I love Jennifer Cruisie! More her older stuff than the new stuff but I rarely see her mentioned on these lists. I also recommend Jill Mansell. British author with British humor. I can never put her books down and one of the few authors I read multiple times.
25051,best spiderman actor,And be attractive..
18956,best YouTube video,The quality of his videos is blowing me away. The new mario kart video is better than a lot of professional documentaries that I've seen. Just gripping. And I don't care about speed running really at all otherwise.
39703,best podcast for biologists,Great initiative! :)
73455,best battery bank,"I use an Anker PowerCore 10000mAh Power Bank. 181g/6.5oz. I have one of their 10k slim models with two USB-A ports as well. Both have quick charging “IQ” ports and they work very well on my iPhone, Fire and iPad Mini tablets as well as legacy USB devices. 


I find that I don’t need more capacity (read weight/expense) than that for travel. It can charge my phone several times and I consider it backup vs a everyday method of charging. I use a multi port USB charger so I can recharge everything at once when I get back to my lodgings. 


The only reason I would go bigger would be if getting into areas with no reliable electrical service. The cell service probably wouldn’t be good as well, so it’s a toss up."
43079,best detective show,"I mean that's because House is a direct riff on Sherlock Holmes, just the mystery is medical instead of death.

House-Holmes

Wilson-Watson

I think there was a reference to 221b but it's been a while"

26616,best board games,Where the heck did you play Sol:Last Days of a Star??? I've only ever seen it at conventions...
6188,best Netflix documentary,"Ultimately, I don’t think it’s a despair-inducing story (like Dear Zachary). It’s a really sad story, but the survivor is the one telling the story. It’s wild, though. Like if this was a fictional movie I’d question some of the plot points as completely unbelievable."
26895,best board games,"I think there's the opposite effect too.  First you see only the upside, then only the flaws, then you see both together for how it really is (sometimes happens in the other order too)."

70557,best major to study in college,"You can find careers that pay that much but if you’re not effective it’s not going to last. Then you’ll be stuck with a degree you don’t care for and it’ll be difficult to correct. 

Find what you’re passionate about. At least a field that excites you. I hate to sound like a jerk, but it doesn’t sound like you can coast through college and still pass. And that’s not a bad thing! For me, I slacked off on classes because I didn’t care.  Once I finally found a major I loved, classes were easy because I wanted to learn more about it. Now I’m in a similar field, not making what you want, but that wasn’t my original goal."

30506,best Mexican war to study,"I don't see Mexico as invading Texas, since at the time it was part of the whole country. Mexico didn't recognize Texas independence until after the Mexican-American War. I apologyse if it sounds like I'm splitting hairs, I'm just very passionate about this period in Texas History. But border Clashes were quite frequent. Texas actually attempted to invade Mexico Twice, The Tampico Expedition, and and invasion of New Mexico. Neither one turned out well for the Texans. It's amazing how this war influenced politics on both sides of the border for years to come. Not just the Civil War in the United States, but two civil Wars and the Revolution in Mexico as well."
39544,best podcast for biologists,Arthro-pod by jonathan larson. About arthropoda but focuses mostly on insects. Not dense at all and he (along with his two newish cohosts) all work in extension.
