I'd say all of them are more or less the same nowadays. But don't use Chrome, that browser spies on you and sends your whole browsing history to Google, and doesnt even offer anything other browsers don't. There's really no reason to use Chrome except that it's preinstalled."

Now, there are other games in this list with simple rules but deeper gameplay. Like Concordia which has simple rules but a good amount strategy."

64296,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"from my orginal r/audiobook post - http://www.reddit.com/r/audiobooks/comments/10u5zy/hey_audiobooks_subreddit_here_is_all_my_audiobook/  
  
I love audiobooks, keeps me sane on my commute to work/home/long solo drives.

I though i would share my audio book knowledge

* signup at local library, get access to their physical audio books (and access to basically the whole states audio book library) as well as cool audiobook download services. ALL FREE

* librivox.org/ and booksshouldbefree.com/ have free public domain audiobooks

* iphone app - audiobooks by spreadsong Inc - has access to thousands of free public domain audio books that STREAM

* turn an mp3 file into an audiobook so itunes/iphone/ipod see it as an audiobook (so you know the audiobook mp3 doesn't mix with your actual music) 

 -add file to itunes library

 -right click it, ""get info"" , OPTIONS tab, change media kind to audiobook

 -it should disappear from your ""music"" area and now be in your books area

* Chapter and Verse will turn a 100-file mp3-cd into one m4b file. lodensoftware.com/chapter-and-verse/

 -this is not the same as combing 100 mp3 files into 1 mp3 file and setting the huge mp3 as an audiobook. that will in fact choke your ipod/iphone when it tries to load the humongous mp3

* obviously audible.com is the mother load of paid audiobooks.  i have used this ""2 free audiobooks"" offer from audbile ......like 4 times now http://www.audible.com/t1/amazon?source_code=AMZDG901LWS101910

 -from that link make an account it will need a credit card attached 

 -""purchase"" your bookS (for free)

 -now cancel the account

 -you will still forever have access to the books, re-download whenever 

 -Do it again with a new email account. It may not work with the same credit card , but it might. your debit card should work too. 

* iTunes has some audiobooks for when you get itunes gift cards.

* DRM Free options

* Torrents - **BUT DON'T STEAL AUDIOBOOKS** 

* The Library of congress has a special section of audiobooks for disabled people. Dyslexia, blind, etc.. Its all free but you have to be disabled to be eligible and you'll have to prove it. http://www.loc.gov/nls/index.html
They have many many many audiobooks you simply cannot buy.

* **special shout out to ""a clockwork orange"", even though i only gave it 4 stars. it stood out as particularly good audiobook. since the language in that book is so weird, having a good British reader really made it a special experience that you just wouldn't get reading it yourself.**"
6037,best programming language for web development,"> Javascript / jQuery as a front-end

It's inevitable that you're going to run into jQuery from time to time. It's not dead. It's a handy tool from time to time. A lot of the things it was created to resolve are gone or disappearing though.  Things like differing cross-browser behaviors, the need for simple animations, and so on.  Focusing on it as somebody entering the field isn't necessarily recommendable.  Should you learn about it? Yes. Should you learn _how it works_? Absolutely.  Should it be your main focus? Not if you want to keep moving forward."

No Way Out - still one of the few twists I never saw coming in any way."
46320,best trick or treating candy,"Wow it's really interesting to see the questions a non-American has about halloween. They seem so in depth and thought out!

There's no set amount of candy you have to give out or anything. Some houses will let the kids dig in and take all they want and others will hand out a single piece to each. You probably want to be somewhere in the middle.

Leaving the lights on should be plenty to attract kids. I'm sure decorations help but I remember going to EVERY house that wasn't completely dark so I don't think you'll have any issues. 

5-8 sounds good and I'm sure it'll start winding down at 730ish. By the way, you don't have to stand right at the door. Kids will ring the doorbell. 

I don't know how prevalent TPing is down there but you'll probably be fine with the lights on, etc. If you do get TPed, keep in mind that it's probably nothing you did or didn't do. It's just some 14 year olds who are bored and like thinking that they're causing trouble."
