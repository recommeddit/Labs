"Born n' bred Barbarian from the west-side/Mesa so I'm a little biased toward my half: 

Cheap Mexican: El Zarape and Super Cucas are both cheap and great. El Zarape also offers a bit more variety if you're adventurous. Super Ricas is good, but there is a ton of hype around it thanks to Julia Childs (her recommendation was totally overblown). You can always expect a large crowd of tourists and locals at Super Ricas, but the previous joints pretty much only cater to locals. 

Asian food: You're SOL for the most part. No place is down right awful, but don't expect super high-quality, super accurate food. Sushi-Teri on Bath and Szechuan on Cliff come to mind."
Perfect timing!!!
"[STRATFOR](https://www.stratfor.com/) is a private intelligence firm which employs former spooks to provide clients with general and bespoke intel on whatever topic they want.

CLASS is the standard NATO term for 'Classified' ie - only available to people who have been vetted to see it. There are levels of classification from RESTRICTED - Government policy and such, to TOP SECRET POSITIVE CODEWORD which means that only a few people in the world have access to that information.

"Most of the germs in your mouth are helpful for your body.   Alcohol destroys those germs as well as the nasty stuff.

Cover your mouth when your cough (preferably with your arm - if you use a hand make sure you wash well), and don't use your mouth in surgery."

"I don't know how it's possible for a human being to not consider *The Witcher 3* an RPG. It's unarguably an RPG. This isn't even up for debate. It's one of the most RPG games to ever RPG.

Just stop with this cancer already."

"It's a tough thing to visualise, if you think about it.

Sure, there are problems with this current viz, as you stated, but I can't think of any other method to present this data in a way which retains its realism.

Sure, you could do some kind ""top 1000 universities as a proportion of population"", or some kind of hexagonal grid like ""top 1000 universities per n km"", or give each orange dot its own space so that none overlap...

...but I think it would become completely abstracted to the point of unreadability.

In truth, it's the 'fault' of reality that the top 1000 universities *just are* in the most developed urban centers, not the fault of this viz."

"When I was a teen, my mom once got off the phone with my older sister and told me, ""It seems like she only calls when she needs something."" 

That stuck with me and now I always call up just to chat. I haven't ""needed"" help from them in decades."
"One of my favorites recently is [Bathtubs Over Broadway](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6029778/) about the world of industrial musicals.

Maybe because some of the songs/products are so odd, or because the ""main character"" was a comedy writer for David Letterman, I spent the first half convinced it was all a windup.  A very interesting topic/piece of Americana I knew nothing about before watching and left really appreciating everyone involved.  It's on Netflix too I believe."
"I drank quite a few of these this summer.  I was drinking bourbon and the bar I was at had some wonderful homemade pickles and pickle juice.  They go down too easy.
