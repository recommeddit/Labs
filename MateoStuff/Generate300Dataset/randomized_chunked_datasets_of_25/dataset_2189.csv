Technically Scarlett was not an ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù sequel and RBP is. So RBP completely leaves Scarlett out of the story telling.",best romantic novel

14409,"I just got around to reading Love Lettering by Kate Clayborn. It was a 4/5 for me, enjoyable but somewhat unremarkable, but I may read again at some point.

Serpent & Dove by Shelby Mahurin was pretty good for a fantasy romance rec, though not nearly enough sex for me. 4/5

The Bridge Kingdom by Danielle L Jensen was almost really good, but it utilised a trope I cannot stand (heroine not coming clean to hero about a previous deception, resulting in a huge needless conflict that could have been easily avoided). I'm really considering giving it another shot, though, because the world building was pretty great and I think I was overly harsh.

Rock Bottom Girl by Lucy Score was also a 3.5/5, good but unremarkable. It got pretty cheesy near the end. 

Iron and Magic by Ilona Andrews is the only Ilona Andrews book I've read so far, but I quite liked it. It's the first (and currently only) book in a series, and it's an offshoot of the Kate Daniels series which I have yet to read. 4.5/5

If you want something a little bit more shallow/unsubstantial/trashy, The Fae Chronicles by Amelia Hutchins might tickle your fancy. The story got pretty flimsy later in the series, and there's bdsm elements, but I found the first book in particular pretty enjoyable. 4/5 for the first book, 3.5/5 for the whole series.",best romantic novel

none of them will be. things change very fast in this industry. there isn't one language you can learn and be good until you retire.

what matters is learning the underlying concepts. nonblocking versus blocking I/O, threads, database access, security, etc. all the backend languages have their way of doing those things, so just use whichever language works for you.

you could look into what the top 3 or 4 languages are in your area. do learning exercises like the Odin project and implement the exercises with each of those languages.",best programming language for web development

33667,"For Tesla, the Superchargers are all (generally, there may be exceptions) at least 6 stations per location, so the locations are what's important. With the other networks, often times there's only 1 station at each location, meaning if you're the second car to arrive, you've got to wait. That's less of an issue with Superchargers.

The Superchargers are super convenient as well, as no apps are needed, you just plug in and charge. The car nav also tells you where to stop and for how long at each stop.

I've done a bit of midwest road tripping in my Model 3 so far and I'm loving the experience.

The UP of Michigan and I-94 west of MSP are issues, though. They're working on fixing them by the end of this year it looks like given how fast the construction has been going and permits getting pulled.",best electric car
