Do you have to play the other ones to know what’s going on?
"if you search online, you can find a 3 months trial code for YNAB.  And I hear that if you email and ask for more time they sometimes grant more.  Or if you're a student, you get YNAB free for a year.  It takes a few months getting used to, but it's super helpful!  I tried Mint before and it was too passive for me."
