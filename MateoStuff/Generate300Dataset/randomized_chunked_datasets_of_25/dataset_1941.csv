16085,"Agreed! Luxottica has systematically bought up all the once respectable brands and produced what are essentially cheap knockoffs using the actual brand name, but still keeping the same price tag. It‚Äôs really sad. A pair of Ray-Bans from 15 years ago were obviously superior just by holding them in one hand and a cheap pair in the other. They fit comfortably, had higher quality lenses, and were also durable and didn‚Äôt break as easily. Now, remove the logos and it‚Äôs hard to even tell the difference.",best sunglasses for fashion
56937,"It‚Äôs an issue of more than just recycling. The energy used to recycle plastic is extremely high, as well as the general need for the recycled product being pretty low. Few companies use a decent percentage of recycled material in their own bottles, so each one you drink is only adding more potential waste and newly created plastics",best water brand

I have two of the dell versions you're looking at and I can tell you they are butter and Dell support if you have any issues is magnificent.  I say that because I had an issue with a 34-inch widescreen having a little too much IPS glow and they replaced it no problem at all. You can't go wrong if you end up making this purchase.  Overclock to 165 at an affordable price on an IPS screen... the only thing I would suggest is to catch a sale.  They always have sales.",best gaming monitor

58609,"1 Tom Ford Noir de Noir
-	Been really enjoying this a lot lately and will be wearing this more often heading into the new year.

2 Dior Oud Rosewood/Oud Ispahan 
-	The latter adds a rosy/floral touch to the former which is a bit more dry and pronounced in the rosewood. I enjoy the Rosewood more as I find the combination with the oud to be more pleasant and they both balance and complement each other so well. These two woody notes remind me of jasmine and ylang ylang in the floral world where they both complement each other beautifully. Side note, Tom Ford Oud Wood walk so Dior Oud Rosewood can fly haha. 

3 Dior Homme Series - Parfum, intense, EDT (OG)
-	These three have been quite versatile in my rotation! I mostly choose them by the weather, respectively from coldest to warmest. I love all three of them though, so regardless I‚Äôm going to enjoy wearing them. 

4 TF Plum Japonais & Amber Absolute as layering. 
-	I find these two to be closely related with some differences that can really amplify and compliment the other.  

5 Amouge Interlude 53 & Black Iris
-	These are recent additions and my introduction to the house of Amouge. I can‚Äôt see myself wearing these in warmer weather as they are very resin and incense heavy compositions. So, these will be something to explore in this colder weather. Both very beautiful, but can easily be quite overwhelming if I‚Äôm not in the mood.",best cologne

17318,"No mention of slay the spire. 

My problem with your list is that the list doesn‚Äôt account for personal preferences. I like card games, rogue likes and RPGs. But you only mentioned 1 rpg that i actually like, didn‚Äôt mention any card games or rogue likes. These games are ‚Äúgreat‚Äù for whoever likes them, but if I hadn‚Äôt already played it I wouldn‚Äôt even know what kind of games they are. I think you should at least give them a genre, or better, organize games by genre. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy the bulk of this list and disagree that it‚Äôs a list of great games.",best iOS game
