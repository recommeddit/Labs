60345,Best comedy show on Netflix,Season 1 Office is amazing
16085,best sunglasses for fashion,"Agreed! Luxottica has systematically bought up all the once respectable brands and produced what are essentially cheap knockoffs using the actual brand name, but still keeping the same price tag. It‚Äôs really sad. A pair of Ray-Bans from 15 years ago were obviously superior just by holding them in one hand and a cheap pair in the other. They fit comfortably, had higher quality lenses, and were also durable and didn‚Äôt break as easily. Now, remove the logos and it‚Äôs hard to even tell the difference."
56937,best water brand,"It‚Äôs an issue of more than just recycling. The energy used to recycle plastic is extremely high, as well as the general need for the recycled product being pretty low. Few companies use a decent percentage of recycled material in their own bottles, so each one you drink is only adding more potential waste and newly created plastics"

15890,best sunglasses for fashion,"I lose mine on the regular.  I have two in my rotation right now that keep coming back to me: off brand, $10 or less aviators and wayfairers."
49428,best gaming monitor,"TLDR: They are amazing monitors and perform wonderfully.  But I suggest you read my post in its entirety. :)

I have two of the dell versions you're looking at and I can tell you they are butter and Dell support if you have any issues is magnificent.  I say that because I had an issue with a 34-inch widescreen having a little too much IPS glow and they replaced it no problem at all. You can't go wrong if you end up making this purchase.  Overclock to 165 at an affordable price on an IPS screen... the only thing I would suggest is to catch a sale.  They always have sales."

Super filling and you can basically customize any overnight oats recipe to your liking."
43734,best items under $100,I like this concept! I did this once too with all the really small stressors in my life because I learned that a lot of small stressors can actually be more stressful than one big stressful thing. I just remember throwing away a ripped paper folder and getting a new one. I wish I could remember what else I did. It was amazing. üòç
58609,best cologne,"1 Tom Ford Noir de Noir
-	Been really enjoying this a lot lately and will be wearing this more often heading into the new year.

2 Dior Oud Rosewood/Oud Ispahan 
-	The latter adds a rosy/floral touch to the former which is a bit more dry and pronounced in the rosewood. I enjoy the Rosewood more as I find the combination with the oud to be more pleasant and they both balance and complement each other so well. These two woody notes remind me of jasmine and ylang ylang in the floral world where they both complement each other beautifully. Side note, Tom Ford Oud Wood walk so Dior Oud Rosewood can fly haha. 

3 Dior Homme Series - Parfum, intense, EDT (OG)
-	These three have been quite versatile in my rotation! I mostly choose them by the weather, respectively from coldest to warmest. I love all three of them though, so regardless I‚Äôm going to enjoy wearing them. 

4 TF Plum Japonais & Amber Absolute as layering. 
-	I find these two to be closely related with some differences that can really amplify and compliment the other.  

5 Amouge Interlude 53 & Black Iris
-	These are recent additions and my introduction to the house of Amouge. I can‚Äôt see myself wearing these in warmer weather as they are very resin and incense heavy compositions. So, these will be something to explore in this colder weather. Both very beautiful, but can easily be quite overwhelming if I‚Äôm not in the mood."
3488,best college for research,Ya post that too to give a clearer picture. Forbes is really a messy ranking so a post without Forbes would give a solid picture. Post it if you can
17318,best iOS game,"No mention of slay the spire. 

My problem with your list is that the list doesn‚Äôt account for personal preferences. I like card games, rogue likes and RPGs. But you only mentioned 1 rpg that i actually like, didn‚Äôt mention any card games or rogue likes. These games are ‚Äúgreat‚Äù for whoever likes them, but if I hadn‚Äôt already played it I wouldn‚Äôt even know what kind of games they are. I think you should at least give them a genre, or better, organize games by genre. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy the bulk of this list and disagree that it‚Äôs a list of great games."
22147,best celebrity,Down to earth and fucking Jessica Biel. Looks like it's back to the $5 liquor for me.
6203,best Netflix documentary,The editing problems had me ripping my hair out at times both within a single episode as well as one episode to the next. None of the timing makes sense at all
