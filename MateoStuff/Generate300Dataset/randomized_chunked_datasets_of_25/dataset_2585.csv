40,best terminal file manager reddit,"As a vi guy, I've been using vifm for many years now and have often recommended it here on reddit and sites like kmandla's old blog.  But in my opinion it's beginning to suffer from feature bloat, so I'm considering alternatives.

To my mind, the ""vi way"" is to leverage external programs as much as possible rather than building the same functionality into a single, monolithic program.  vifm seems to be straying from that path, in an attempt perhaps to match Midnight Commander feature for feature...

File managers, btw, are to the shell utilities (cp, mv, etc.) what full-screen text editors like vi or emacs are to ed.   They show you the context of what you're working on and many people (including myself) find this useful.

13376,best spreadsheet editor,"Oh, because I'm supposed to write a spreadsheet program that exceeds Excel? Even though there is no real use for it as runtime execution is a significant performance hit. 

Everything, I've said is established fact. 

FYI this script will defeat anything you can run in Excel. (Matrix-Matrix product, performed linearly to avoid excessive indexing calls). Nearly beats Fortran Matmul (in fact it does beat it at low optimizations, but loses at -O6), so yes it's super-fast.  

    fn multiply(&self, other: &Self)-> Matrix<f64>
     {
     let mut z = Matrix::<f64>{data: vec![], dimen: (self.dimen.0,other.dimen.1)};
       for k in 0..self.dimen.0{
       for i in 0..other.dimen.1{
       let mut k:f64 =0.0;
       for j in 0..self.dimen.1{
        
        k+=self.data[j+ (k*self.dimen.1)] * other.data[j*other.dimen.1+i];
          }
                z.data.push(k);
           }
           }
           z
           }
     }

If you can beat this in Excel, I will eat my shit (You can't it's impossible). 

Excel is computationally worthless. There are better ways to implement it."

I cook up a bunch of egg/sausage mix on Sunday and either wrap em up right then, or just store it in the fridge and do 1 or 2 quick wraps each morning. Usually add a dollop of salsa too.

I haven't eaten cereal in the morning since school, but sometimes if I'm up early I'll eat a quick bowl."
