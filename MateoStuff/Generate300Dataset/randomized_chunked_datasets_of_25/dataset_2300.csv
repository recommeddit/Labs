73207,"Any flavor of Ubuntu that looks interesting or for your hardware.  They have a ton of support, things ‘just work’ more than most distributions and there’s a ton of forums and posts that usually have answers for what you’re trying to do.

I’ve used Ubuntu, Centris, and even Slackware.  Granted, 90% of my linux use is in the command line, so I’d say that most linux distros are the same.  Well, more specifically they’re more alike then they are different, and the changes are mostly just swapping  some command here and there even though the rest of the string or package is the same.  Once you get under the hood of how things work, and since Linux is so modular with the way programs are all segmented like they are, you use most of the same commands.

I’ll leave it to someone else to touch on the desktops, I really don’t care and usually mod the boot loader to send me right to the command line anyways.",best Linux distro

29719,"Hmm. I have only properly experienced Xbox One, Xbox 360, Xbox, Wii, 2DS, GBC, PS3, PS2 and Philips Videopac G7000. G7000 wasn't great by any means (early computers like C64 beat it in every aspect), I only keep a PS2 around for a single Star Trek game and I have sold Wii, 2DS and PS3 away because they didn't fill my needs. That leaves four, but even so wouldn't really feel like a proper answer to the question at hand.

Instead I'll list top five features I respect the most in a console. I understand you may have to take actions, but please leave me breathing.

**1. Background music** - Honestly an obvious Xbox thing, but nonetheless a priceless casual feature.

**2. Rapid loading times** - We're rapidly losing this... to the barricades!

**3. Low noise** - For some reason I have had a PS3 spin a game disc *ultra fast* while I was watching Youtube. WHY?

**4. Serviceability** - I like to open my stuff up and maintain them thoroughly. This too is getting harder and harder.

**5. Brand** - Not all companies are equal, sadly. Sony: hacks. Microsoft: We remove more features than we add new ones. Nintendo: Whatever, you fight to get hold of one anyway.


I didn't include mundanes like exclusives or graphics because those are just too obvious. The only reason you get a console is to play games, thereby you get the console that runs the games you want to play.",best game console

>**Grouping Ranked Colleges**

>To make valid comparisons, schools are grouped by academic mission into 10 distinct rankings.  

>**National Universities** offer a full range of undergraduate majors, plus master's and doctoral programs, and emphasize faculty research or award professional practice doctorates.

>**National Liberal Arts Colleges** focus almost exclusively on undergraduate education and award at least 50% of their degrees in the arts and sciences.

>**Regional Universities** offer a broad scope of undergraduate degrees and some master's degree programs but few, if any, doctoral programs. We ranked them in four geographical groups: North, South, Midwest and West.

>**Regional Colleges** focus on undergraduate education but grant fewer than 50% of their degrees in liberal arts disciplines. They sometimes predominantly award two-year associate degrees. We ranked them in four geographical groups: North, South, Midwest and West.",best college in california

The upshot seems to be 1. you’d have to feed some wire through the zipper bodies since you can’t padlock paracord; 2. someone could just cut the fabric so it’s not great security anyway; 3. safest thing is just to keep your bag in sight at all times; 4. people feel very strongly about the concept of locking a ruck.",best suitcase lock
