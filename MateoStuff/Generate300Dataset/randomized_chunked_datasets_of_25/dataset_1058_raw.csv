My Rush 24 is holding up great since around 2012 too. Looks as good as the day I bought it. What color did you get?
"Oh man, I miss the OG Gran Turismo. you had just enough to buy a shitbox car and start racing."
I love Benjamin Moore Pale Oak.
My calc 3 prof wouldn't let us use a calculator. It wouldn't have helped much anyway.

"If i could have any game ported to the pc no questions asked, it would be The Last of Us. The best game i've ever played."
"1) VTI/VOO/SPY -index funds are always the safest and best long term play due the average investor, board market find are the best out of these.

2) tech: AAPL -huge moat, AAPL also has a nice stock split history and looks to become a strong dividend growth stock

3) consumer cyclical: KMB -also a huge moat, as well as providing necessary products (you can skip soda, or chips, but not toilet paper or diapers)

4) health: JNJ -moat like everything else, and doesn't depend heavily on parents (patents*, woops) which could expire in the next decade

5) energy: XOM -has a high level of planning/forsight, and seems to listen to shareholder meetings, meaning it'll likely keep up with changing energy trends."
"Ditto, but swap FCM for Brass Birmingham!"
"Holy fuck, have you been to school before? Do whatever works for you. There's a place if you have so many questions, it's called the ""New Student Q&A 2016""."

"Uhhh, not true at all. In banking, it's experience and proven track record in numbers that gets you a job. 

I've been in banking for years."
"> Off 5th also have great quality options at good prices.

Yes! I've seen some amazing deals on designer sunglasses at Off 5th. Granted, I love crazy styles, so some of it is kinda niche. That said, they have a lot of great classics too."
The HD or Lowe’s app is great for reducing the wandering around time.
"It's not even close. Michigan's adventure best coaster is as good as some of cedar points worst rides, like gemini.

It's worth riding Michigan's Adventure wooden coaster solely because of the airtime, but the rest of the park is basically nothing."
"Aviator sunglasses. Every Memorial Day I come back home and there he is, sitting on the lawn in his sunglasses."
The best alternative one is Facebook Audience Network.
"I majored in International Studies, but close enough. 

Tips:

-study abroad as much as you can

-internships every summer

-learn a foreign language

-specialize in a region of the world (preferably Asia or the Middle East)

-ideally, match your specialization with your study abroad experience and language choice (ex - if you want to focus on the Middle East, study in the Middle East/North Africa and study Arabic)


Pros:

-flexible, more so than poli sci; you can get a lot of the poli sci jobs with International Relations but can also market it to businesses, schools, and non-profits; you can do this with a poli sci, but in my experience having the more international focus tends to draw more attention

-interesting, relevant subject material

-makes study abroad much easier credit-wise

Cons:

-you'll probably end up working abroad/in DC 

-you'll most likely work for the government or a non-profit (although businesses might take you, especially you have honed your language skills), meaning the pay isn't that fantastic

-it's so broad it's hard to narrow down what you want to focus on"

93 til infinity vs Third Eye Vision? Great pick btw
Aldi Winking Owl. Less than $3 a bottle and it tastes like it's worth 3 times as much!
