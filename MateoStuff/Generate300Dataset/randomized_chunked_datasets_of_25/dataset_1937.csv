33886,best Pokemon game,"For me, the best games overall (in terms of mechanics, design, music ecc..) are HG and SS, but Platinum and Crystal are not that far behind. FR/LG and Emerald are great too but maybe they're a bit old for you.
The new games are a little too linear for my taste but X and Y are not bad. BW and the sequels may have a great story and but i found the pokemon designs to be the worst of all gens. The real question here is: do you like retro graphics? If yes, than play all the games from starting from Gen1 so that you can have a clear picture if the evolution of the games. If not, well...it's a shame, really, but i suppose you could start from HG/SS, than Platinum and BW ecc...
If after playing the main games you became passionate about the pokemon world, try Mistery Dungeon Explorers of the Sky, one of the best pokemon games ever, and Pokemon ranger (to experience a different and enjoyable take on the standard formula).
Last thing: the classics are called like that for a reason, do not forget it, they are the essence of the serie, so give them a try when you feel ready and if like old graphics."
5691,best programming language for web development,"People need good front-end work. Companies have a lot of back-end developers and no one to prevent the back-end developers from making their apps/sites look like shit. 

Companies have no rhyme or reason to their HTML/CSS style guides. Teams add duplicate pieces, they misappropriate styles, they wreck the semantic integrity of their sites. 

Being able to create usable, semantic, modular markup and style sheets is unbelievably necessary and rare. IBM just hired a friend of mine to try and rescue their bloated, disjointed front-end. He's making upwards of six figures now. 

I made WP themes (basically HTML templates) for years and brought home upwards of six figures. 

There's work if you want it."

42869,best detective show,"I checked Netflix and they’re not on there anymore, but available on other streaming services—-The Fall and The Killing are two of my top 5 fave crime shows. 

Broad church IS on Netflix, and seriously just about the best. Highly recommend."
53983,best medicine for a cold,I almost wish I had a cold so I could try this intriguing method!  *knocks on wood*
47271,best state to visit in the United States,"Charleston SC and Savannah GA are some of my favorites in the south.

As far as the northeast, philadelphia, new york city, baltimore's inner harbor, and washington dc are all pretty good."
45299,best gaming system,"You're definitely right, but it's actually exactly that. Tight budget, and I'm a hardcore Forza fan. If Forza wasn't an Xbox exclusive, I would have switched to PlayStation a long time ago. Although I must say, the Xbox controller is MUCH better than the PS controller in my opinion."
37930,best Marvel movie,Watching Avengers 1 for the first time when i was 9 years old was fucking great.
30644,best Mexican war to study,"They tried to give Osama bin Laden to Saudi Arabia (or another third party), not us."
34018,best Pokemon game,R/S/E or D/P/Pl
206,best terminal file manager reddit,Don't know why you got all the down votes. It is better to learn how to navigate in your terminal with the navigation commands. I try many file manager and stuck with ranger and just got used to it. or maybe it's a little lazier. Really a terminal file manager is faster. If you set things up properly. Still it's nice to know both; commands and a CLI file manager.
60712,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I agree.  I want to add Neal Brennan. I discovered him on ""comedians in cars drinking coffee"".   He was a  co-creator of Chappelle show.  He has some good stand up on Netflix with shades of Dave Chappelle type comedy."
44109,best items under $100,Or just line the bottom with Kosher salt and bake in a hot oven.  It will pull up all the 'wet shit.'  Then you can scrape any big nasty pieces off with a spat.  Then re-season with oil and towel.
38709,best newspapers to read,"When I worked in the financial sector The FT, Times, Telegraph and Guardian were the most respected, in that order. The other 'legitimate' national broadsheet is The Independent. 

The Mail has a bad rep, with good reason, but does occasionally run good pieces of investigative journalism on its key tub thumping issues like private equity takeovers, so I don't think it's quite in the same league as Fox News yet. Most of what it reports is sensationalist, inaccurate dross though, and it's basically a tabloid nowadays."
8713,best toothpaste,"I too was hoping some japanese dentists would comment on Hydroxyapatite pastes.

The only thing I can offer to this discussion is due to my background as a geologist and geological engineer: the mineral ""Apatite"" is what enamel actually is. It's the mineral Apatite, plus some biological scaffolding. 

Fluoride ions can fit themselves into the crystal lattice of enamel and, in doing so, strengthen it, but it's different than simply supplying more Apatite building blocks directly to the teeth/enamel, which is what Hydroxyapatite toothpastes attempt to do."
14892,best romantic novel,Sure thing!!
67958,best science fiction novel,"**A Canticle for Leibowitz**, Robert M Miller, 1960 - Quite simply, one of the best books ever written, much less scifi."
61051,Best comedy show on Netflix,"The second season is where it really finds its stride, IMHO; last few episodes of the second season are as good as TV gets. Third and fourth are equally excellent, but Sorkin left after that (after a little incident with his baggage at the airport) and the last four seasons are derivative."
69756,best major to study in college,"First of all, almost every major is useless if you can't show employers what you learned with it (i.e internships, publications, research, papers/projects beyond what is expected of a college assignment, ect.). Also, you may have the risk of making your degree useless If you want to stay in a certain area. In doing so you are limiting your job prospects in that industry. For example you major in art history, but their is only one art muesum in the state and you don't want to leave the state. 

Second, most majors themselves have some degree of usefulness. Supposedly useless majors such as philosophy, history, psyc can be great prep for an advanced grad school degree like pre-law or other intensive writing/research degrees. Others like English, Classics, Journalism show that you can write well which is always valuable, and can lead to jobs in copywriting, editing, ect. 

That being said, their are some degrees I would not recommend getting: 

*Sports Management*: Coming from someone that worked at the highest levels of athletics, a sports management degree is useless. While their are jobs in sports (they just require you to grind and they are really competitive to get) I know for a fact that hiring managers don't give a shit what degree you have (except for like athletic training). They just care about your experience. So sports management itself doesn't get you hired, and it eliminates career options if a career in sports doesn't work out. Its also getting a rep that it is an ""easy major,"" in which I agree is the case with about 98 percent of sports management programs. Again, going to what I said earlier using the art history example, probably isn't a good idea to major in sports management if you attend a small private NAIA school in the middle of Iowa. 

Other useless majors include *dance/ballet* if you have a bad knee or back. And *African American Studies from North Carolina* (google UNC academic scandal)."
