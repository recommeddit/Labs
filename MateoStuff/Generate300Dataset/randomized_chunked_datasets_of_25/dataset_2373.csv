15493,best tree for the garden,"Thanks.  Here's a pic of the front.  The tree to the right in the photo is going to be removed.  We may actually have to excavate to fix the foundation, so we will get rid of the diagonal brick sidewalk and could put the new tree kind of anywhere in the space.

69306,best major to study in college,"I'm an incoming freshman going to Purdue and I've been wanting to go into Computer Science since 6th. I've been teaching myself since then and have been lucky enough to have a high school with 2 CS courses. You can make video games, work for big name companies, work with start ups, work with artificial intelligence/computational intelligence, front end/back end stuff for servers and web, databases, etc. The list literally goes on forever. Just like math, Computer Science can be applied in what seems like every field. And the thing is, once you know a language, you can more easily learn them all. Plus you can do multiple things from the list above. For instance, you can work at a some CS company or whatever, and then in your free time be making indie games or doing research. Honestly, I've been waiting for this moment for a while and am really excited (in case you couldn't tell haha)

My ultimate goal is to do research in AI and make indie games on the side. I hope I can be a part of a project to help create an AGI."

85,best terminal file manager reddit,"Nice!  Hey, if I've got your attention here's a feature request:

Either a command key  or  toggle for in program help screen for keyboard shortcuts.   Doesn't have to be always present (Toggle on off maybe?)

Fantasy request:  Context use clues like [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/img/screenshots/screenshot-i3.gif).   I always have trouble with the select. . .

Edit:  But keep up the good work!  Awesome program.  It would be my main file manager if I could just get the multi select to work."
35889,best alcoholic drink,"Gotta watch out for malaria, bro."
18176,best YouTube video,">It actually manages to get me somewhat hype, which I guess proves their point.

I was thinking you couldn't have been 100% serious with that, but wow. That was amazingly done."
33787,best electric car,"Pretty sure the P3D that went faster around the Streets was modified with wider tires and upgraded brakes?

The 3 is absolutely in that class, it may be as expensive as the true Luxury cars, but it isn't one. It simply does not have the interior to fit in that segment; I am not saying it has a terrible interior, it is about on par with a high end Accord/Camry which is pretty nice, but not at all on the Luxury car level in both materials and fit and finish.

Maybe next generation they can bring the cost down and quality up."
33627,best electric car,"My first car (that I paid for) is a model 3. 

Only cost me $1k to have an electrician run a line to keep it charged and since then I've made back $2k in gas savings.

Worth it."

44860,best items under $100,"Almost all shoes are to narrow.

We have almost an entire civilisation where people walk around in shoes that hurt them, or are uncomfortable. Just ask around and you start to realise almost everyone has this problem, some don't even know about it. People even get deformed toes and nail problems and they still don't think their shoes are too narrow.

Just look at sandals, as soon as there is no back support to squeeze our foot into the tips the whole design of the sole has to be changed.

Shoe designers are the first to be lined up when the revolution comes. Some will be spared, but not many."
54514,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Thanks for the review.  I'd love a recommendation if you don't mind.

I currently own the Hien (soft) & Raiden (mid).  I was debating ordering the Hien in mid to try but after seeing the new Otsu v2, that has caught my attention.

Otsu v2 worth giving a shot? Wonder how different it would be in mid vs soft.  Thoughts?"
72659,best wireless lightweight mouse,"Yeah if you like small mice the UL2 would be good, I was obv hyperbolically harsh on it but like I said, it’s basically a 60% clone of the Air58 with a better scroll wheel and no paint job"
