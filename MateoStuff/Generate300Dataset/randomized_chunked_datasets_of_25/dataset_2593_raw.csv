I just thought to include him into the poll because he's part of the family I don't wanna exclude anyone
"I like the Anker and Amazon Basic branded cables. They are usually about half the prices of Appleâ€™s, MFi certified, and both customer services are responsive if there is an issue. 

Yes they arenâ€™t $2, but I donâ€™t have to worry about my house burning down."
"My favourite twist is Memento.Because the structure is complicated, you have to concentrate to understand the story so your mind won't be looking for twist and then it'll blow."

By any chance do you know if d- is smaller than oox? I've been using the rtings tool but they don't have oox yet. Thanks in advance.
Still in Fiji?
"Ok ffs what he means is that you'll pay ~$200 for $20 quality sunglasses, honestly if you want the rayband brand go look at fakes or get another company for actual better quality than what OP has now"
Well my mom is going through a messy divorce because my stepfather cheated on her. She has no idea how long she'll be able to keep her house before she has to find a place to live and has no job because she's on disability. She doesn't have much money and has asked for only grocery store gift cards for Christmas. I'm hoping to do that and maybe stock her fridge. My husband and I don't have much money to do gifts but we'll try our best.
I find Aventus better. Silver Mountain begins to smell extremely weird after an hour or two of having it on.
Monster is a long show with like 70 episodes but itâ€™s really good. Iâ€™d recommend saving it for a rainy day when you want to binge something intense and mysterious with characters that are never thrown away no matter how small they might seem
"A couple have already mentioned it, but I just wanted to give another shout out to IEEE Xplore. Bloody good resource, even using Google Scholar it's likely where you'll end up."
Nemo. I like having a built-in terminal
"Yeah edge a shitty browser who can't even use their own engine is from 21st century, lmao"
This list is fantastic! Thank you so much for putting it together :)
"Ooooh, I haven't. I have a feeling you just introduced me to some gold. Thank you."
"Amazing! I would pay to be able to work with Winans ðŸ˜† 

I regularly listen to his soundtracks as well, super talented guy! Did you work on *Spin* too? Probably my favourite short film of all time."
"I'm using Atom for GUI, Nano for the console work."
Used the Smartish case on my XS Max for 2 years. Very satisfied with it. Ordered one for my future 13 Pro.
"its personal preference in the end, really. But once you get used to arch, its a bit more powerful, and you learn a lot more"
Best thing about this video is how humorous he is while he is obviously being pranked and can laugh about himself at the end. The whole video is pure positivity and fun!
Just make sure sheâ€™s looking at the right end or she might be blinded.
"Probably a social thing. As mentioned, most guys don't want you to buy them anything unless you know that they want it. Giving them cash is a weird admission of not really knowing/caring enough. Again, most people won't care, but that's how I feel when I give someone cash."
"If that's what makes you feel safe, then you do have a problem. I truly hope it doesn't take accidentally shooting someone you love to make you realize you are making the world infinitely LESS safe by walking around like 8 year old pretending you're a cowboy. It's not 1860 and no one's out to get you. I'd say I wonder how many more school shootings it's gonna take before people say enough is enough but it's clear you could have a shooting every day and no one would bat an eye...but keep telling yourself that it's normal, and all those dead kids are worth you feeling good about your dishes."

"Actually, she said that very thing, that Lucille Ball was notorious amongst flight attendants at the time (""stewardesses"" at the time) for being a snob."
