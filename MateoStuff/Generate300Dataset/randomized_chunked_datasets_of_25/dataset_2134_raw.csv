and the dick ugly Bolt is the first off the line.  Lame.
"if we're starting an organization from the ground up, I'll take the 10th best QB before I take the very best WR or RB. AP was the best RB in the league for a number of years, do you think that the equivilant of AP at the QB position wouldn't have accomplished significantly more as far as wins."
"i consider that loosely defined to its detriment for sure. when somebody asks me what their favorite RPG is it would be weird to see somebody say ""God of War"". i mean hey, whatever, but it's just weird to me."
The Jinx was fantastic
"Swedish Fish are like gummy bears but they're a little chewier and they aren't so over-the-top, cloyingly sweet.  Also, they look like Atlantic Cod, possibly the tastiest of all the fishes."
If you prefer controller use and the game doesnt support it use [Pinnacle game profiler](http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/download)
"This reminds me of when my mom wanted to know what we would have for dinner mother's day.

She asked ""What are you making me for mother's day?""

I replied ""Disappointed.""

And then I laughed."
"Lady, I can't give you your foot back.  I tried finding a hobo with the same size foot as you to get you a ""donor"" foot, but the hobos are all dudes."
"Interested in board games? Well I can give you a list that will give you a deep dive into a wonderful and amazing hobby, starting with games which are easier to get into.

ONE Pandemic

Players act together to save the world in this game where only cooperation will let you survive. Plays in about an hour.

TWO: Ticket to Ride

Build train routes across America and cash in your tickets for game-winning points. Also takes about an hour and comes with many plastic trains.

THREE: Splendor

Compete against other jewellers hoping the win the favour of a noble patron. Plays in less than an hour.

FOUR: Sagrada

Dice drafting game where you are making an intricate stained glass display. Fun game for 2-4 players which will be unpacked, played, and packed away again within an hour.

FIVE: Lords of Waterdeep 

Okay, let's get used to the concept of agent placement, using this D&D themed game. A 60-90 minute game, depending on whether eveyone involved has played this before.

SIX: Tzolk'in the Mayan Calendar

Worker placement meets planning ahead in this fun game about being a Mayan. Game last for one revolution of the wheel, or about 90 minutes.

SEVEN: Tsuro

Let's calm thing down a bit with this game for 2-8 players, which will be over quickly but leave you looking forward to the next challenge.

EIGHT: Caverna: the Cave Farmers

Hope you enjoyed that break because now it's time for a deeper dive into a strategic game where luck takes a back seat to planning. Expensive to buy and long to play, this game is much loved by experienced board game players.

NINE: Terraforming Mars

This strategy game has a SF feel, and again rewards planning over luck.

TEN: Terra Mystica

Top of many people's lists, leave this game until later, and better yet find some experienced players to help you through the first game or two.

*it's numbered 1-10 in my preview but not where anyone else can see it? whatever reddit code."
"Engineering, IT, Finance.

They pay the best out of college."
Persona 5.
"I dunno if this helps but I searched for ages so that I could schedule things, and schedule tasks.

So I can schedule a dentist appointment 12-1pm Wednesday but that day I want in non time slots ""Chemistry chaper 1.2"" ""Post tax letter"" ""phone for doctor appointment"", and that these stick out until ""ticked"".

You have this on google calendar you have a list at the side. However this functionality is a bit cooky on the app and there isn't really a way to fill in the gap. So if this specific thing appeals to you and you will only look on desktop then google calendar as it's free.

If you want this in an app ticktick is the only one that does this. It's more of a ""productivity/task"" app but it functions a lot better than most of the non-google calendars, and obviously better in this one aspect. It is a paid thing tho."
"AT&T is generally pretty good from what I've seen, but I only had a SIM for a hotspot for a few months when I needed to make a network for cybersecurity stuff.  T-Mobile is usually pretty good too."
Which one has smoother glide and softer feel on the arms? Is it the Otsu v2 or the Zero?
I recently got a pair of American Optical Original Pilot on Amazon for about $100 and they feel/look amazing. I love that they come in three sizes since a lot of sunglasses only come in one or two and they're usually too big for my tiny head. The fact that they are genuine American made and not part of the Ray Ban / Luxottica monopoly is just a plus.
Thatâ€™s great I was just saying the information you have is incorrect
"got the LAST two episodes in the series left, so scared to finish it, but perhaps I'll just go ahead now"
"Ugh, so before the current iteration of La Pausa there was an earlier one that was even more beautiful and it *did* last forever. I'm still kicking myself for never picking up a bottle back then - the current iteration is also super nice but because I have a memory of the (superior) original, it feels like my heart was already stolen before."
"In my experience handling files and parameter serialization and a few other things in axios is far superior then what you need to do to get that working in fetch. It's not terrible in fetch and it doesn't take much code on top of fetch, but fetch still isn't widely enough supported based on what some people's clients require."
"Rear Window (1954) and North by Northwest (1959) are both excellent.  I know they are ancient by modern standards, but give them a try if you haven't seen them."
Anytime i hear The offspring I immediately want to start lifting heavy shit.
"That's because they hit your T zone so great!


 That's T for taste and T for Throat cancer!"
I'd recommend asking this question on /r/malefashionadvice that way you wont look like a loser eighter
"Britta filters are not intended to make water *safer* to drink, but rather taste better. Namely, they are a simple particle and activated charcoal filter. Activated charcoal is effective in removing halogens (such as chlorine used to treat water), some volatile organic compounds, and various sediments. It can remove some microorganisms to. It won't remove dissolved inorganic compounds, heavy metals, etc.

We use Britta filters to remove the chlorine taste from our residential water, and in that capacity, they are quite effective. This summer, we had a coliform contamination problem in our area and we did not rely on the Britta filter to remove the possible contaminant (though, the pore size is such that it would have been at least partially effective in that capacity, it still wasn't worth the risk)."
