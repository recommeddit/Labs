30097,"Will Fowler's *Santa Anna of Mexico* is by far the best English-language biography. For a good history of the Mexican-American War that gives a lot more attention to the Mexican side than most others, Peter Guardino's ""The Dead March"" is by far the best for that. I worked with Dr. Guardino on my Master's thesis, which was about the Mexican-American War.

John S.D. Eisenhower's ""So Far From God"" and K. Jack Bauer's ""The Mexican War"" are good military histories, but are of course Americentric. Most of the books covering the Mexican side of the war are, sadly for you perhaps, in Spanish.",best Mexican war to study

38148,"Yes, Hulk the movie sucks. Hulk the character is great, as is Mark Ruffalo. I like him better than Norton, both in his early ""tortured soul super-genius"" mode and his later ""vaguely stonery comic relief"" style.

I went to SD Comic-Con in 2007, went to the Hall H presentation with RDJ and Ed Norton and Gwyneth Paltrow and I guess Kevin Feige was probably there although I had no idea who he was then.

At one point, someone asked Norton what his involvement behind the scenes of the movie was. He did a cute little ""aw shucks"" move, looked down at his shoes, and literally said ""I wrote the movie"". That is a direct quote, and I have not forgiven him for it.",best Marvel movie
59451,"Ah, that's a bummer about Ichnusa! It's so beautiful--isn't it weird how one strange association can make you think differently about a scent? 

Fior Fiore made me reconsider pear. I'd always thought it was too sweet, but I was intrigued by a scent that emphasized the muskiness, rather than sweetness of pear. I think I prefer something greener (am testing Cartier's Carat which may be a contender) but Fiore is quite good and definitely one of my favorites from the recent pear trend.",best perfume
