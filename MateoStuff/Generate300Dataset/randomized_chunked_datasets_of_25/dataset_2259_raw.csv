"Piper's right, but just in case you need a second opinion to convince you of that....piano. It's the single most useful tool for learning music you can have. Plus it can do anything you want-- melody, harmony, rhythm, you name it. In addition to being the most helpful, it's also the most versatile. There's a reason so much keyboard music has been written throughout history."
Mous always. Screen just refuses to crack with their cases.

"Plus he has way more recieving yards than Brady, not even close really"
The Daily Mail gives me an up to date social commentary and the current condition of UK immigration trends.
I mean technically everything in the right dose is fine.
It's in Mission Hills.

"New York Times Reader is a good purchase, pretty cheap and gives you the full newspaper every day (keeps the last 7 days, you can access archives on their site). I believe they also have a PDF version you can subscribe to that's even cheaper."
It could also have to do with his team doing so terribly even when his own stats were good. Wins aren't an individual stat obviously but QB is probably the most appropriate position to take team wins into account for.
"Everyone's basically mentioned the big AAA RPGs already, so I'll just throw a few out indie/smaller games:

All 3 titles by Supergiant Games: Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre. All are unique games with good stories, fun characters and settings, and AMAZING music.

I would also throw Child of Light into the mix. Not an indie, but looks/feels like one. Great art style and another game with fantastic music.

"Do not apologize. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world. It's made from the fruit of an orchid indigenous to Mexico. Natural pollinators don't live anywhere else, so every commercial flower is pollinated by hand using a technique developed by an ingenious 12-year-old. The pods are picked by hand at the peak of ripeness, processed, dried, bundled, aged for months, and finally combined with fresh eggs, milk, and pure white sugar, churned and frozen using technology which was invented just in time to take advantage of the marvelous new flavor. Every bite of vanilla is a journey across three continents and a testament to ingenuity."
"Geography Now! 

Prepare to whistle the theme to yourself for the next 6 months."
Haha why would she take it to a professional level if she didn't like it? And if it was actually physically uncomfortable she might have been doing something wrong.

"One thing I'll say about knock off sunglasses is that they usually don't offer UV protection. They also might be polarized, but it's usually either a coating or a film on the front layer. So when you clean it, it rubs off. If you spring for the real deal, they make two layers of glass or plastic and then sandwich the polarization layer between them. Other than that, they usually look fairly similar."
"Home Depot. It's closer to my house by 2 miles. And I'm just so familiar with the layout I can navigate that place really quick.  Their prices are so similar it's almost like Coke and Pepsi. Pick one and stick with it.   
  
Worth mentioning: most of the stuff they sell at either place is pretty crappy quality. If you want nice stuff go to places that specialize in it. Lumber / trim / doors: go to a lumberyard. Plumbing fixtures: plumbing supplier. Lighting: chandelier store. Etc. you get the idea. These options cost more but you get what you pay for.  
  
If you have to build something that you want nice and square for gods sake don't by 2x4s at HD or Lowes."
Ocean of pdf is back  they took down the site in2018 or something. And for mam its good site I recently got in its not hard at all it's just a process like basic questions and thats it.
Belgium won almost every game since losing to France whilst France lost and drew some. The current model used by FIFA is quite close to ELO so the Friendlies actually don't weigh that much in the formula
Mesa burger then walk over to the park next to it.
Woods by A&F (from when they were still a smallish company in Missouri). They kept it for a long time but discontinued it a few years ago. Haven't been in a store since.
An ipod nano. I don't know how it has lasted so long.
