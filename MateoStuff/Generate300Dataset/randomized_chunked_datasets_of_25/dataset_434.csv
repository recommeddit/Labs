12570,best gifts for mom,"I would have just turned 8.
My mum is awesome but I think that particular christmas was just too much, first one in a new house ($3500 mortgage!) in a new country .. I asked her about it not too long ago but she can't remember it anymore. We had a cardboard box table and milk crates for a few months while waiting for our stuff to get from england by boat. I have fond memorys of those early days in australia, swimming in winter etc. Was in Adelaide .. I shudder at the thought now.

They still had the record up to a decade ago, it looked brand new and just as crappy as the day i bought it. I remember playing about 30 seconds of it once.
Absolutely the worst record ever .. it wasnt even a good recording."
