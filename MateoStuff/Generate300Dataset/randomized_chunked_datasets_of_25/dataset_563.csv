35277,best alcoholic drink,Pacific Cooler will always be my favorite!
64971,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Metropulos for sandwiches! The gyro and the pesto chicken are my favs. Close to there is Lucky Penny for pizza and Helena Bakery for pastries. I also love East Beach Tacos, and echo others on Corazon Cocina for fancy (but really, really good) Mexican. The yuzu ramen at Nikka blew my actual mind. Renaud's for pastries and brunch (the quiche is great). Idk if Third Window Brewing still does food but I've loved every iteration of their menu. 

And obvs a jaunt down the 154 to Cold Spring Tavern for Tri-tip sandwiches."
7982,best laptop for general use,"It is a pretty good device, but it has a TN display, which is a big downfall."
56733,best desktop monitor,"Damn, bought it for $120 a month or two ago. Great monitor (that I'm using to type this). I'd definitely recommend it."
15081,best romantic novel,"Yes, he was also totally my type :D. Wanted to be her so badly :D"
72671,best wireless lightweight mouse,"That was a good read and I couldn't agree more with the point, that it's absurd that $50 for a mouse is considered cheap."
20498,best workout music,(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_LqnUFBUC8)
39015,best web browser,firefox or chromium edge is great.
24171,best anime,"Late to this, but, in no particular order:

1. Ergo Proxy - definitely an 'adult' anime: big idea sci-fi, intentionally slow at times, and occasionally a little expository, but a lot of fun if it's up your alley.

2. Samurai Champloo - Ersatz period show with a great mix of genres. Funny as hell at times, but also serious at times.

3. Another - To me, at least, the most accessible 'thriller/horror' anime. Nicely coherent short run, too.

4. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - Slice of life meets supernatural meets comedy. Also: you need to watch this series to get the jokes in about 50% of comedy AMVs.

5. Jungle wa Itsumo Hare Nochi Guu - This series makes no sense at all, and is glorious for it.

6. Madoka Magica - So freakin' good. Turns the magical girl genre on its head and is incredibly coherent for a [insert spoiler here] story. That said, this series is more delicious once you've been watching anime/reading manga for a while and can appreciate how it twists tropes.

Bonus: and, of course, the classics: Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, etc."
22623,best celebrity,Even as a male I think he's lovely and cute. I wish we could have tea and discuss things quietly in a small neat kitchen.
63266,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Yes, because Sileo doesn’t exist for your device."
7609,best laptop for general use,"Hi, if weight is a big concern, I'd go with the Acer Swift X on my list. Ryzen 7 5800U processor, RTX 3050 Ti graphics, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS display."
40735,best instrument to play,"What's the difference between playing sax and masturbating?

You eventually want to stop masturbating for a while."
27828,best breakfast foods,Throw some scrambled eggs on the side and it's perfect.
70614,best major to study in college,Ling is so cool! I took an intro class a loved it (even though it took a lot of effort). Can I ask what you do with a comp ling degree?
68136,best science fiction novel,"(1) The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (Heinlein)

Note that this was written during the golden age of sci fi, and hippies were just becoming a thing. Heinlein is one of the grandfathers of modern science fiction, and I'd rate him alongside Asimov and Clarke. If you like this, also try Starship Troopers and Stranger in a Strange Land. 

(2) Hyperion (Simmons)

This one ends on a cliffhanger. It is recommended you continue to read Fall of Hyperion afterwards. It really should be one book. Very good. You may also enjoy the next two in the Hyperion Cantos series.

(3) Ender's Game (Card)

A classic in modern sci fi. Main character is a young child being indoctrinated to become a military leader. Good story, exciting environments, relateable characters.

(4) Player of Games (Banks)

Bank wrote ten books in a series known as the Culture. This is book two. The books can be read in any order, but this one is a good entry point. The Culture is everything that is good about Le Guin magnified.

(5) The Martian (Wier)

It is like popcorn. You just read, and smile, and be entertained. Read it while camping somewhere remote for added effect."
48410,best color to paint with,Hi! This is such a beautiful space. The furniture you’ll be putting in it- is it more browns/ black or whites and grey?
4904,best home improvement store,What an interesting debate.  I can see how this would be a relationship ender.
43416,best ad service for mobile applications,"Reddit, the best place on the world wide web."
23475,best car racing video game,Mitsubishi GTO!
18858,best YouTube video,"[Cactus Prank Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15tnqRGz9OA) is relatively unknown with ~~9~~ 900k views.

56875,best water brand,"Oh, I have OPINIONS on water!

The best I’ve ever had was the tap water in Paris. I like to get Italian waters sometimes to try and replicate that taste.

If I’m just grabbing something, or buying in bulk, I’ll usually get Crystal Geyser, as I like the taste and it’s cheap. If they don’t have it, I’ll spring for Fiji.

I try fancy waters whenever I see a new one, but none really stand out to me. I do like Voss in the glass bottle though.

Once in a while I get Dasani, but only ice cold. It has an almost chlorine taste to it, but sometimes I like that.

I won’t but Arrowhead or Aquafina, I don’t like the taste of either. Smart Water does not even deserve to have water in its name.

(My tap water is unfortunately unpalatable, so I buy bottled water so I’ll actually drink some- as you can see, I’m sensitive to water taste!)"
61178,Best comedy show on Netflix,This is an awesome show. You really need the right sense of humor for it though. I don't know if it's for everyone.
4206,best text editor,"Well...VS Code isn't bad at all, but I still think it has some catching up to Atom.

VS Code's startup time is very slow and comparable to Atom's due to both being a Electron Hybrid Desktop app. However, in my experience at least, Atom has much more powerful extensions that Code ATM thanks to it's bigger community support.

Again, don't get me wrong, VS Code isn't bad, I just feel like it's a more limited atom without the pro of it being more lightweight.

Also, am I the only one that loves having 2 editors at once? Sublime for quick opening files, and Atom for actual projects."
32209,best hotel to live in,This is scary shit. I once attended a youth conference which involved staying at a hotel for a week and the organizers were so stringent about this that they had special security placed on the girls’ floors right in front of the elevator doors and stairs so that no guy could sneak there
