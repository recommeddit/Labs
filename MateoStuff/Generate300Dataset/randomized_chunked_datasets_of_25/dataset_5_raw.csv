"Best was Gen 5. it really was an amazing Generation. BW1 had the biggest roster, forced you to use the new mons during the regular playthrough and had a pretty good story. And BW2 had the best post game in my opinion. 

Worst. From the games I played, definitely the Let‘s Go games. They were just really lazy Kanto remakes with Go Mechanics slapped on. Definitely not worth the price tag of 60 bucks. 

Though, from the live-streams I watched, SwSh are just embarrassing and low effort products."
"Leela Palace, Bangalore. Make sure to get Club Level for better drinking and dining options."
"If you can find one with the Benson Leung seal of approval, it's practically guaranteed safe."
"A question from a newbie who's gonna get his first iPhone: why did you choose Spigen Mag Armor and not the Apple's silicon case, for instance? Apple's case has also a raised lip protecting the camera from what I saw, so what are the advantages of Spigen Mag Armor over Apple's cases in your opinion?"
"Thank you. Im seeing a theme of nyt and wapo. Ill have to pick one of each manually for a few days to see which I like better.

Economist is also something I had been considering.

Thank you!"
"So true..Dark is like nothing I’ve ever experienced. It’s the only show that, imo, is truly mind blowing. (If you watch it high it’s even more intense.) I recommend it to EVERYONE I can. I just wish more people gave it a chance"
This has been on my gym play list since for 10 years.
"There is nothing called best.. If you want privacy then it's firefox.. It uses less resources too.. If you like chrome, then it should be edge as it is very fast and uses less resources"
"Hyperion, Yes! Please everyone read it OK? NOW!"
"If you're going to go to Austin, you might as well drive a few more hours south and go see the Alamo."
"While I can appreciate that this is what a lot of fathers would like, I want the opposite.  I spend everyday with my kids doing all the little things like baths, playing, and generally spending time with them.  So, every father's day, and my birthday, I always ask for my wife to take them somewhere for the day so I can have the house to myself.  A day with peace and quiet is the best."
"solid and stable, clean looking, at least the kde and flawless, no bugs just runs smooth. without a doubt it is the best distro right now"

Ok I already have two blankets. Could a relationship cost under $100?
"It is a fantastic game no doubt. Still, a little odd to see it at one. I don't think it's anyone's number one game, but everyone still rates it very highly"
"Ahh that's great. The friend I accompanied is about halfway done with his 46er as well. I've only done a few of the peaks but am thinking about joining him for the remainder of his journey, and eventually finishing mine."

"Blacklist, It's always Sunny in Philadelphia, House of Cards, Lillihammer, Persons Unknown (was ok), Agents of Shield (has its moments), Bobs Burgers, Futurama, Archer, Heroes (early episodes)."
"When I bought a webcam, I was initially going to go with the c922, but after watching reviews ended up buying the Razer Kiyo which sits in the same price bracket. That one might be worth looking into! :)  


I have had no issues with the camera at all and am very happy with the quality. It has an inbuilt ring light which does a lot to improve the lighting on my face."
"South Africa’s would be better than WI and Ind imo.
