Plus, you can always go into specific subjects in each topic and be a combo channel with makeup and science. I say go for it!",best major to study in college
6227,"Stink! - all about chemicals in our daily lives and how unregulated a lot of industries/products are that we use. 

Shot In The Dark- About people who make and sell footage to news outlets in LA.  Like what the movie Nightcrawler is about but they follow around the real people who do it for a living.  

Alone- Making people survive in the wood by themselves.  Last person standing gets a half million dollars. This is more of a reality show but its still good.

Mars- More of a docudrama but it is very well done.  Following what colonization of Mars would be like.  It is shot in a way that draws on real world issues and makes parallels to what might happen when we colonize Mars.   

Waco- Another Docudrama but still very good about well Waco.  If you don't know much about the incidence and it's lead up I highly recommend it.  

Frye- Documentary on the failed Frye festival.  It's actually fascinating. 

Rotten- A documentary series about the food industry and its failings and shady practices.  

Tread- A man feels slighted by his adopted town.  Builds a tank and takes revenge.  

Making a murder- Man is accused of murder twice.  But is he innocent? 

Behind the Curve- About the flat earth community.  

And once you finish all that and your bored why not go down the UFO rabbit hole?

Unacknowledged - Aliens are real and the governments been covering it up.

73243,"All three Distros sound fine for what you want, because all user-friendly distros do all of those things.  I've found Mint works great for people who want things working 'out of the box'.

All three have long-life support, you just do a distribution update about once a year (or with Ubuntu/ Mint I think you can leave it for up to 5 years). The distribution update just needs you to click 'update', then the computer runs slow for about 30 minutes, then you reboot.

For a snazzy, modern look, Cinnamon's fine. Actually anything's fine except LXDE or basic XFCE.

All of them have massive app stores, and all of them have LaTeX for Physics reports, simple LaTeX displays, Libreoffice, python (not sure what type of Physics you're doing).

As to the Windows apps, you'll have to be more specific, but Mint and Ubuntu both have MS Teams, TeamViewer, Zoom, et c.

No Linux distribution can reliably run Adobe or MS Office stuff (you might install it, with some hassle, but there's no guarantee it'll work after a week).",best Linux distro

Last Christmas I won a battery-powered Ryobi circular saw and drill kit from a contest at the local Home Depot. (Specifically, [this set](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-18-Volt-One-Lithium-Ion-Drill-Driver-and-Circular-Saw-Kit-2-Tool-P826/204321512).) The saw is a little weak but the drill is nice enough, but when I showed them to my mother she was fascinated. My mother does a lot of small, simple jobs around the house and power tools make things easier for her, naturally, but all of her power tools are corded and most of them are old and extremely heavy, and these days she sometimes has trouble hanging on to them. So this Christmas I'm buying her [the complete set](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-ONE-18-Volt-Lithium-Ion-All-in-1-DIY-Combo-Kit-12-Tool-P859/204065437). They're much lighter and easier to work with so I think she'll be happy.",best gifts for mom
11147,"I like hiking-quality daypacks for college.  I am in engineering, so I have heavy books and walk all the way across campus.  Having an internal frame and waist straps is *immensely* beneficial in saving your back and making your load feel lighter.  

I know they are expensive, but I got mine at REI.  The benefit?  They have twice done major repair on it, for *free*.  It cost twice a normal backpack, but has lasted 5x as long and is more comfortable.  I used to kill a backpack or two a year- this one I had thru half undergraduate and all graduate school.

Now they have models that have laptop pouches.  In addition, the hydration packs are useful in that the water pouch can be filled with a laptop instead.  

Go to REI with a couple of text books and a laptop and see what works out.  I had a Gregory pack myself, but my particular model is not made now.  Get a backpack with at the minimum waist straps and prefereably in internal frame- your spine will thank you.  


I have heard the [chrome](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/packs.html) bags are really good workmanship/quality (albeit expensive) but I havent found a place I would try one on.  Fit is pretty important for me, and most male packs have chest straps that go right over the tits (not comfortable at all).",best backpack for college

23506,"Thats not even the issue I have with Forzas, its the fact that there is no progression due to the immense 'level' scaling. Doesnt matter what car you have or what upgrades you buy for it, since your opponents magically get all the same stuff.

After I realized that, I lost all interest in Forza Horizon 4. 5 will probably be the same bullshit.

I remember in NFS: Underground 2 if you progressed to quickly you soon found out you were racing against too fast cars compared to yours. Then you grind a few races, get that big turbo and go back and be competitive. It felt good, thats how it should be.

In Forza new cars or upgrades are meaningless, because you dont see any difference. Also the focus on supercars and hypercars gets pretty boring. They lose all their appeal once the whole game is about them.",best car racing video game
