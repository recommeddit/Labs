"I did that hooray, my drain can't keep up with the shower head!

Honestly I cleaned the drain recently,  not much came up since I'm already using a tub shroom.  Could I have a obstruction further down the line than my zip it can reach?"

"Washington DC, New Orleans, Chicago, San Diego, San Francisco or Seattle. Can’t really go wrong with any other these cities, they are all awesome places to visit as a tourist and each city brings a different element of the country."
There are categories on the site. I always use those and they're what really makes the site shine compared to others as I can actually find new material there.

"By far, a day for myself.  Whether it's a preplanned lunch with my friends or a date by myself to the movies.  I just want her out of my hair for a couple of hours.  Please make the decision of where to take her, don't ask me what to feed her, how to entertain her, just plan something.  I'm not an asshole, I love my family, however not having to worry about dinner, entertainment, work, school for a couple of hours would be delightful.  Monday, I'll take control again."
Kent c dodds’ epicreact.dev is the best one out there IMO
can't help but think one of these is not like the others...

I'm surprised no one has mentioned that Poland Spring is owned in part by Nestle.
Loquita. Hands down.
"Its that he's very little and now he walks around outside with a hot waffle maker on to keep warm. He has terrible, terrible burns and smells of poorly prepared toast but he isn't hypothermic at least."
"With regard to Vietnam specifically, it was (in my opinion) unjustified because the Vietnamese communists were arguably more pro-American than pro-Chinese or pro-Russian. It was political bigotry that caused our allegiance to fall where it did and caused our actions to be so out of step with our interests, and it wasn't justified. If we could have said, ""Vietnam's government is communist, but they're *our* communists!"" a lot of idiocy could have been averted there and elsewhere.

With Korea, well, what are you gonna do? That was almost just an epilogue to WWII."
"Electrolux owns almost all the sub brands that make chest freezers, so no matter what you buy you're very likely to get the same model of an Electrolux freezer. After a lot of research I figured this out, and I read the same sorts of reviews when I was shopping for a chest freezer 3 years ago and had the same thoughts. Based on everything I read, I did 3 things:

1) Stalked Lowe's / Home Depot for clearance and / or scratch and ding chest freezers. If I was getting the same model no matter what I bought, I was going to find the cheapest price.

2) Found one, bought that store's 5 year extended warranty. It was $50 on a $400 freezer and covered everything, even the food inside if it spoiled because the freezer broke.

3) Bought 4 patio bricks and placed the freezer in my garage on the bricks, not directly on the floor. Many of the bad reviews mentioned rust on the bottom and I figured having it off the ground where water could condense / pool more easily might help. So far, no rust.

Finally, I keep a water bottle that I pre-froze with half the bottle filled with water in the freezer, but laying on it's side. So the water is stuck to the bottom even if it lays on its side. If the freezer ever fails for an extended period of time when I don't notice (like a power outage) when I'm not around, the water will melt and pool on the side of the bottle, and then refreeze that way if it was a power outage. It's super reliable and less expensive than a $50 wireless thermometer that might fail on its own anyway."

"Baffles me seeing Black Panther up there at 1. It’s my second to last out of the MCU. But it’s all subjective, I know I’m in the minority and a lot of people love it."
"I can tell you my least favorite.  Live Oak.  Tiny leaves everywhere, all year long.  And it hails acorns in the fall which actually cause dents on my vehicles."
I would definitely pick Accounting over MIS. There's more demand for it and it's more versatile. EE I'm not sure is a great pick either - that field is really getting saturated as of late.
