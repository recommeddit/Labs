69361,best major to study in college,Majored in engineer. Would have majored in computer science because of how much programming and software are so highly valued in today's society.
46401,best trick or treating candy,"If the kid can't spell Halloween, the candy is for the parents.  Give him an extra chocolate bar and tell him it's for his fatass mom.  Tell the kid to ask her why she needs so much candy.

If the kid is sarcastic when he spells it, he's too old for it.  But, his parents are probably dicks and don't buy him fuckall.  Tell him to explain his justification for his costume, then give him  a handful and close your door on his face.  You'll each think you've won.

If the kid is proud he knows how to spell it and smiles whilst doing so, give him a second handful.  He'll need it to bribe the bullies from giving him atomic wedgies from now til Christmas break.  By then, hopefully, his mom will put some clothes under the tree that don't make him look so gay."

54320,best medicine for a cold,"Realistically you are not going to ""beat"" a cold in 24 hours, the best you will be able to do is minimise the symptoms.

Your best bet (assuming no allergies) is to treat:
 - Aches
 - Congestion
 - Running nose

Most people reach for OTC cold and flu medications or antibiotics, and while the former will help, the later will do literally nothing.

What works for me is asprin, $1 at the shops and no aches, as for congestion, a steamy shower (or just breath over a bowl of boiling water) will knock out the congestion.

Drink lots of fluids and avoid things that dehydrate you."

11719,best gifts for dad,Air compressor...he loves it.
15611,best tree for the garden,"Neither did I but it seems to do fine.  Saffron needs a similar rain cycle to the west coast.  Crocuses do great in the PNW.  Not a lot of late frosts here.  Actually some of the leaves survived the snowpocalypse in November and they look like adolescent chives right now.  

I can't comment on whether the flavor develops fully or not.  I have some in partial sun, I will move some to a sunnier spot when they go dormant again and that'll give me a better comparison."
30223,best Mexican war to study,We don’t focus on the Mexican-American war much besides the Alamo in my experience. The focus at that point was on Texas and the increasing tension between slave and free states in the buildup to the Civil War.

5786,best programming language for web development,"You really don't need to worry about backend stuff yet. Just learn javascript. Everything there is to know about it. write it, read it, make cool tools with it. Read JS the good parts, study client side frameworks. Learn jquery. There's a shortage of people who are really good in JS. 

After that get into node.js. Because you'll already know javascript and node is so easy for quickly making web servers."
69786,best major to study in college,No you couldnt... the interest alone on 500k would be like 3.5k a month... and earning 800k/year would mean your taking home around 450k a year after taxes and 401k
13352,best spreadsheet editor,Are Excel developers aware of these things? Is there a way you can tell them? Or is Excel not going to change any time soon?
