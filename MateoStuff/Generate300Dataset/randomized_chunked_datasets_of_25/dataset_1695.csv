46401,"If the kid can't spell Halloween, the candy is for the parents.  Give him an extra chocolate bar and tell him it's for his fatass mom.  Tell the kid to ask her why she needs so much candy.

If the kid is sarcastic when he spells it, he's too old for it.  But, his parents are probably dicks and don't buy him fuckall.  Tell him to explain his justification for his costume, then give him  a handful and close your door on his face.  You'll each think you've won.

If the kid is proud he knows how to spell it and smiles whilst doing so, give him a second handful.  He'll need it to bribe the bullies from giving him atomic wedgies from now til Christmas break.

Your best bet (assuming no allergies) is to treat:
 - Aches
 - Congestion
 - Running nose

Most people reach for OTC cold and flu medications or antibiotics, and while the former will help, the later will do literally nothing.

What works for me is asprin, $1 at the shops and no aches, as for congestion, a steamy shower (or just breath over a bowl of boiling water) will knock out the congestion.

Drink lots of fluids and avoid things that dehydrate you.",best medicine for a cold
