Meets my actual checking account balance.
Is it normal to find fragrances at Costco? I can't remember ever seeing any there.
"I’m doing the ALM in management and completed an internship at a fortune 50 pharma company and interviewing for another position today.

Like anything else don’t expect the program itself to allow you to waltz into a role, but in my experience people respect the name, find it interesting and are open to networking.

Also career services has been a good tool for me!
Linda is amazing and helped me navigate my experience effectively and make friends! I highly recommend it :)"
Since when node has fetch api built in?
"Mclovin, at Bonnaroo."
My dentists usually recommend Colgate Total
"Ah yes, the classic Doc Morgan."
"The difficulty progression in recent Forzas works differently: You start driving at ""novice"" difficulty and as you get better in the game, you are supposed to increase it and get bonus credits. That's really it. FH4 is even weirder, you don't even have to win races, you just need to finish them."
How is INSIDE so low on that list?
"Mother! 
Bird Box
Talented Mr. Ripley"
"Top 3:

1) Shangri-La in Mactan, Philippines -- oh my God this place was amazing.

2) Sheraton-Moana Surfrider in Oahu, HI-- I believe it's now the Westin? It definitely changed names since I've been there. It's a BEAUTIFUL old hotel, amazing history and just a great hotel.

3) Sheridan Beach Resort and Spa, Palawan, Philippines-- it takes so long to get there (travel to the Philippines, plane from Cebu, hours long drive), but it is SO WORTH IT."

"Totally, brah. After a killer bulk sesh I like to chill with the fam, usually by slamming some dunks on my son, chugging tea at a party with my daughter, and then later I pound my wife."
"Probably only because it's Italian, not English. Even in use in music notation, you're speaking Italian... it's not really been co-opted into English."
Ain't No Click - Lloyd Banks
"Person of Interest is a detective series, in a way.  It starts fairly straight-forward and develops, over 5 seasons, in to one of the greatest shows I have ever watched.  Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."
"still doesn't make it ""Halloween candy"""
"This one may fall short since it a relatively recent comic book movie but that scene truly got me. I’m usually really good at seeing things coming in movies and the filmmakers just did a good job at hiding it and distracting me before they revealed that. Love that scene, and the subsequent ones after. So much awesome tension, and really nails the work life balance Spider-Man always struggles with"
I like getting dad holiday shirts. I have one for every Father's Day since my first kid.

"I love that if you can afford it, the law doesn't apply to you.

EDIT: To those of you saying $100 isn't that bad, you are missing the point entirely.  Special treatment by institutions because you make more money is bullshit, period."
