16797,"Thanks yesthis11. Your post makes so much sense. Of course I would obviously spend time with it to train and exercise, but maybe I am not quite ready yet. I am just trying to learn more and more. I absolutely hate people who get a pet/dog and keep it locked up in a cage or secluded in a room or outside on a leash. I think its cruel! If I do get a dog one day, it would be a real family member that I would keep by me all the time when I am home etc... that being said though, not sure if I am ready for that lifestyle change just yet.. I have always wanted a dog, but my current lifestyle doesn't make it a very easy option to consider at this point...",best pet for toddlers
