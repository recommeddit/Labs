72115,best movies with a cool twist,"I thought the twist was that things didn't work out in the end.  The mini twist is that it's not your average horror movie, and revealed early, but the real shocker came that there's no happy ending."
3432,best webcamera,"I am a BIG believer in the ""only spend Twitch money on Twitch equipment"" mindset.

Currently using my phone as a camera, I've got my old headset with a mic, it's okay. Will probably get the first payout soon so I'll be investing a part of it in the stream equipment, but so far I've only used the stuff that I had before. My lighting is literally an old desk lamp. I have one monitor, and all my games are windowed and occupy like 3/4 of the screen so I can read the chat.

And everything is going just fine.

Don't invest until you're sure it'll pay off."
68013,best science fiction novel,Check out Aaron Dembski-Bowden  as well and Graham McNeil to a lesser extent .
55156,best places to hike in the east coast,"I spent a week every summer for 10 years at Lake George. 

I LOVE upstate NY. The drive from Albany to the Canadian border is awesome, and the rest stops are so cool. 

Great picture."

2. Xbox 360

3. PS4

4. X1

5. PS3

I also own a PS2 and a 3DS XL. I just don't have the same emotional attachment to them as I do my top 5."
41474,best instrument to play,"I would say, voice. The Indian classical tradition revolves around either emulating the natural sound of the voice or accompanying/supporting it.

Given today's music technology—with access to a microphone, audio I/O device and computer—you have at your disposal a melodic instrument, percussive instrument, and harmonic instrument (with the addition of looping, etc.).

I only say this because people often understate the importance of the voice as an instrument, otherwise I'd say piano."

59595,best perfume,"I don't know most of these and will therefore be basing it entirely off of their names.

30s woman, generally a classy person, professional career, you enjoy artistic pursuits but don't have too much time to engage in them."
42629,best detective show,First season was pretty good. When it became about the stalker boyfriend it turned into a soap opera
46658,best trick or treating candy,Is this by purchase? Or by opinion poll?
45011,best items under $100,"Beat me to it! This was my first thought; menstrual cups are such a period upgrade. Nothing disposable to run out of, and you can empty it as needed, wearing  it for up to 12 hours at a time, which is great for lighter days. 

I also just feel cleaner when using the cup. Absorbent solutions (tampons and pads etc) are great, but it’s nice to not have to deal with dryness or pads bunching. Period days involve the cup, and period underwear for backups/overnight/heavy days, and nothing else. No stress!"
18810,best YouTube video,"[I tried making an art house film when I was like 11 or 12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXVkH7xPgQY&list=UUjXwErWsirWQde0SA3IReHQ).  Still makes me cringe sometimes when I see it, but it's kind of heartwarming and funny in its own way."
