3432,"I am a BIG believer in the ""only spend Twitch money on Twitch equipment"" mindset.

Currently using my phone as a camera, I've got my old headset with a mic, it's okay. Will probably get the first payout soon so I'll be investing a part of it in the stream equipment, but so far I've only used the stuff that I had before. My lighting is literally an old desk lamp. I have one monitor, and all my games are windowed and occupy like 3/4 of the screen so I can read the chat.

And everything is going just fine.

Don't invest until you're sure it'll pay off.",best webcamera

41474,"I would say, voice. The Indian classical tradition revolves around either emulating the natural sound of the voice or accompanying/supporting it.

Given today's music technology—with access to a microphone, audio I/O device and computer—you have at your disposal a melodic instrument, percussive instrument, and harmonic instrument (with the addition of looping, etc.).

I only say this because people often understate the importance of the voice as an instrument, otherwise I'd say piano.",best instrument to play

I also just feel cleaner when using the cup. Absorbent solutions (tampons and pads etc) are great, but it’s nice to not have to deal with dryness or pads bunching. Period days involve the cup, and period underwear for backups/overnight/heavy days, and nothing else. No stress!",best items under $100
