"It's a pretty good list but I see the exclusion of Clannad After Story as a pretty glaring flaw.

If you look at the major ranking sites of Japan (Anikore, ranked 12th), China (Bangumi, ranked 4th) and the west (Mal, ranked 13th) it's pretty clearly a top, top anime. In fact it's actually the only one which is in the top 15 in all 3 of the major areas."
The ability to compromise your values.

"India will be an excellent Test side for as long as their current amazing bowling attack stays together.

The big question will be whether India have the pace bowling depth to replace Ishant, Shami and Bhuvi in the next few years."
Go out in public and lick as many door knobs as possible.

"I went with my stepfather to Singapore when I was 12. We look absolutely nothing alike and have different surnames, but he was there for work reasons and I was invited to come along instead of my mother because I was really interested in East Asian history at the time and had never been further away from my home country of the UK than Italy.

Even through the relevantly innocent eyes of a 12 year old girl it was clear that they thought this foreign musician had brought along some little girl to have sex with, to the extent that the hotel staff smiled knowlingingly and arranged us a very nice double bed rather than the twin beds he'd asked for.

Everywhere we went staff would ask about our relationship, and then nod in a your-secret-is-safe-with-me manner when he explained that I was his stepdaughter. And we were, literally, doing nothing more unusual than going to known tourist hotspots or him dropping me off at the local mall so I could buy pirated computer games (ahhhh... 1992).

It drew my attention so asked him about it when we got home. Apparently he'd been repeatedly asked to prove that he knew me and for details regarding my passport when I wasn't there. On a couple of occasions really nice ladies who worked at the hotel would ask if I needed anything or to use a phone and I, oblivious, as I was, was just like ""oh, no thanks!"" 

It's nice to know that people were looking out for me in case the OTHER thing was happening.

I can imagine those people have seen some bad shit going on in their hotel."
Nice straw man that you're attacking there.
"In EU, specificly in Finland these ID4 type of cars are +45k€ spartan model.. actual price 50k€ with some features.. government credit 2000€ this is insane difference in the price for same product."

Anyone know if getting Astro A50’s is a good or bad idea are there better alternatives for Xbox?
True!! Curious to see if/ how the company grows...

Spigen thin fit has been my go to for a long time. Not this year. Is not the same. I also got a clear one from spigen but it just feels cheap. I’m still trying to find a good case. Waiting for the official apple leader. Didn’t like any of the colors of tbe silicone ones they released but they do feel good on the hand and had good quality on my 11
"Ublock Origin, hands down. It is fully operational out-of-the-box, allows for deeper tweaking for those who desire it (quite easy), and is reliable. I trust it over all others currently available. I have experienced no slowdown in Chrome or Firefox, and have been using it for years."
">It's so easy for sunglasses to break

Because you're buying cheap, plastic sunglasses from H&M.

> get lost/get stolen 

I've had the same pair of Ray\-Bans for 5 years. I never lose them because they're either on my face or in my car. Sunglasses rarely ""get stolen"" when you don't leave them laying around. 

You're blaming these issues on the glasses when it's really your lifestyle that can't handle them."
"Not Gentoo.

They guarantee 4mbps last time I checked.
Damn 8 LG 38s?? I’ve never heard of someone even putting up with more than like 3 returns. What was wrong with them?
"That sounds great, right now I'm looking for something that will play Amazon Instant, my smart TV doesn't do that, just Netflix and Pandora or some shit. If I were able to play Amazon Instant through Chromecast, I would be sold, but that doesn't sound like the case."
"Great minds think alike! This case seemed to meet my needs, at least for now. I kinda want to wait and see how the whole “MagSafe” thing plays out and give third party companies a chance to come up with different versions of it. Mini power banks that ‘snap’ onto the back sounds cool but I’ll wait before jumping on board."
That's dark :( Is everything ok now or shall I give you internet hugs?
"Aside from places like Vancouver, it is around or below freezing for five to six months of the year, and as such not very nice to be outside. But, at least in my experience in Toronto, the summers are awesome and filled with amazing stuff to do because enjoying the outdoors is so precious."
