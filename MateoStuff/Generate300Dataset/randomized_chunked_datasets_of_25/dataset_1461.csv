7464,"hello! was hoping to find some help here - am looking for a durable laptop (to last 3 - 4 years) which has good battery life and speakers, and preferably is also able to handle a large number of tabs open (20 - 30). would also really appreciate a keyboard that is easy to type on and doesn't jam (like the mac butterfly keys for example). would you have any recommendations? no real budget constraints at the moment though of course tending to the affordable side would always be better. thanks so much!",best laptop for general use

23296,"+1 on Street Legal Racing Redline. Honestly, it's not something you could really call a 'good game' - buggy as hell, singleplayer is lacking, physics are.. not great (though usable, feels like they lack some refinement more than anything). But the amount of ways you can build a car, especially with a few mods, I'm pretty confident in saying 'has never been matched since'. Decent soft-body physics for a game this old too.

For anyone curious, it's somewhat back in development and is available on Steam. Other than that, GOM-team has previous versions for free, which are the ones that most mods are meant for (no idea how the Steam version handles mods really). The *""SLRRMWM2011 - The Compilation STAGE1""* is a good one to start out with IMO, coming preinstalled with a couple mods, fixes and extra tracks (like the Nordschleife for example).",best car racing video game

53687,"I got a question. When I had a cold a few months ago I drank this tablet (called Neozep here) for my stuffy nose. A few hours later I had a terrible asthma attack which really terrified me since I don't actually have asthma, that was a first. I never thought of it again and didnt blame the medicine- until when I tried to take it again, and bam, asthma attack again. Can someone explain why this medicine for runny nose gives me asthma???",best medicine for a cold

The interior is delightful, the coffee is great, the sweets are delicious, and they have killer seasonal milkshakes in the summer. Kreuzberg (started by Cal Poly grads) is rad, too. The place is full of art, there's ample seating, they roast their own beans, and they serve breakfast all day. What more could you want in a coffee shop?

Honorable mention always goes to Linnaea's, SLO's first coffee shop.",best places to eat in Santa Barbara
27775,"I love porridge/oatmeal and eat it almost every day. Favourite ""recipes"" include:

* Cook the oats with egg whites (I usually do a half cup oats with 1/3 cup egg whites) plus desired amount of water for super voluminous creamy oats. I usually add almond butter to my egg white oats
* Add a sliced banana before cooking, cook as usual then stir vigorously. The banana will disappear into sweet creaminess. I usually add almond butter to this combo as well
* Apple pie oats: diced apple and cinnamon
* Carrot cake oats: Shredded carrot, raisins and cinnamon
* Pumpkin oats: cook oats with canned pumpkin (super low calorie and high fiber!) then add either pumpkin pie spices, cacao powder or almond butter

I also love rolled oats uncooked. I'll stir them into plain Greek yogurt like you would granola. If you add peanut butter powder to this combo, it tastes like cookie dough. Or, I'll mix oats with peanut butter and jam like an unrolled ""energy ball"".",best breakfast foods
