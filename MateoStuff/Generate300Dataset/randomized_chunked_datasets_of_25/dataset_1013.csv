54851,best water filter,"In my backpacking experience, where it is often impractical to pack sufficient water for the duration of a journey, I have experimented with various methods of water purification. Although I have never used bleach, my preferred method is to use iodine drops or tablets in conjunction with ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Adding ascorbic after iodine treatment precipitates the iodine out of solution and removes that nasty iodine taste. The procedure is as follows:

* add iodine to the untreated water (for iodine solution, add 5 drops per quart when the water is clear, 10 drops per quart when the water is cloudy)
* shake and let stand for 30 minutes to one hour (depending on who you ask)
* at this point the water should be safe to drink
* add ascorbic acid (usually in tablet form) 
* shake and let stand for ~10 minutes
* enjoy!

Some other thing to take into consideration (from [OA Guide to Water Purification](http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/manual/water.shtml)):
>It is important to note that you are using the iodine solution to treat the water, not the iodine crystals. The concentration of iodine in a crystal is poisonous and can burn tissue or eyes.

>In order to destroy Giardia cysts, the drinking water must be at least 68° F (20° C). The water can be warmed in the sun before treating or hot water can be added. Refill the treatment bottle after use so that the solution will be ready one hour later.

>Be aware that some people are allergic to iodine and cannot use it as a form of water purification. Persons with thyroid problems or on lithum, women over fifty, and pregnant women should consult their physician prior to using iodine for purification. Also, some people who are allergic to shellfish are also allergic to iodine."
26797,best board games,"Keep in mind, this is a list from some more “hard core” gamers. It’s not reflective of the sub at large, just a small subset of people who are subscribed to the guild on BGG and have rated their games on BGG as well. 

Calling it “The Sub’s” Top 100 is definitely overstating its case. It’s an interesting exercise every month, but that’s about it."

5129,best home improvement store,"I am convinced that whats happened in both is they started with a stack of lumber, 90% of it was straight so people bought that.  They ordered another stack, threw the leftover crooked 10% on top, and sold the good 90%, adding another 10% to the crooked pile.  This went on until they had a pile that was 100% crooked lumber, they don't order any new lumber because inventory shows they have a giant stack of it.  Nobody bothers to look and see that the entire stack is warped."
