I have to disagree; high skill immigrants can pretty easily get a job/visa and wrote their own ticket.

I'm paying for a lawyer because she is sueing me.
"I was using SiteGround but then I switched to BlueHost to save some money. BlueHost is definitely cheaper (I was paying just $4 per month) but cheaper in this case definitely doesn’t = better. TBF I actually don’t mind BlueHost but it hasn’t given me what I need or want, and I’ll be switching back to SiteGround once my 3 months are up. I know, I’m an idiot."

Midnight Commander really is the best file manager I've ever seen. I made a presentation about it some years ago. You can find it in a link [here](http://blog.nawaz.org/posts/2012/Dec/a-guide-to-midnight-commander/).
Fair cryuff turns do give you at least 5 extra rankings
Was having my battery changed literally at the time you were writing that. Can't recommend enough.
vifm is definitely worth a look for vim people.

"Just out of curiosity, a MacBook and Apple Pencil are by no means cheap. So if you’d already spent a fair bit of money on the devices, why cheap out for the accessories?"
That's a good one! I'm tagging her now

I'll be doing a lot of painting in my new place.  I will totally try this.  Now I just need to find a way to cleanly transfer paint from one 5 gallon bucket to another (since I'll be buying 2 or 3 five gallon buckets of paint+primer).

Doesn't mean they aren't your best bet haha
VASAviation might be up your alley. Basically transcripts of interesting atc/pilot communications with simple animation.
Accounting.. Yay I'm not wasting my time.
"I don't know that I can get behind ""greatest work of science fiction ever written"" but those four books definitely return to the forefront of my mind multiple times per year, probably multiple times per month - that's much more often than many of the accepted classics do (I almost never really return to thinking about *Foundation* for example).  


Sure, the intricate layers of the story and the way it reads as an entirely different sort of novel by the end are critical features, but I think people overlook  Wolfe's talents as a prose stylist - this is probably part of what the above Redditor was getting at with the highlight feature. Wolfe has a way of making the interplay of the words themselves captivating to me. Really I can only think of Mieville and Catling as his contemporaries there (hell, maybe McCarthy is a more apt comparison), but I'd love to find a few more writers in that vein."
"I created a content management system using Google Spreadsheets called [Goezinta](http://goezinta.com) (as in what goezinta the spreadsheet, shows up on one or more web pages.)  The idea is that many people know how to use spreadsheets and very simple HTML, but don't know how to maintain static web pages on a server.  This provides a bridge for such people."
