3960,best online college,"I have an online degree from a non-online school. No schools in my state offered a Masters in the program I wanted to attend, so I applied to a bunch of random schools. I was accepted into one of the big programs, basically if you have an interest in historic preservation, this is where you go. Unfortunately, tuition was way outside my grasp, but the online program was a lot more affordable.

I ended up finishing my program while working for a historic preservation group. When I started applying for jobs, I got a lot of wtf comments from employers because I had to explain that I worked full-time and finished my program at the same time. Hell, I took a full course load, worked 40 hours a week, and worked on my thesis all at the same time.

Did it work out for me? Not really. I ended up falling into freelance work. I write for some companies online, published a book completely unrelated to my field, and haven't worked in historic preservation in around four years or so. I still love the field, but I got screwed my a former ""supervisor"" who I tried and later threw me under the bus. The school itself talked up the program and kept mentioning how its grad professors were almost all former grads of the program. Turns out that they almost never have any open positions, so I couldn't apply for work there. Most grad schools have a small number of teachers and jobs as professors almost never turn up. I loved the program and still love historic preservation, but my life definitely didn't turn out the way I intended."
41413,best instrument to play,"It depends on how you approach learning it, how much time you can put into it and finally what your goals are.   
  
Good is pretty subjective so there's no easy way to answer your question without more context."
31951,best hotel to live in,"Starwood has some damn nice hotels, and their points transfer nicely to other things if you end up with tons of them. Its my understanding that you can transfer them 1:1 to a lot of airlines (although I haven't), and they also have some good promos."
72879,best Linux distro,What do you mean /that/ kinda person? Haha
15127,best tree for the garden,6 foot trees will grow to 12 feet in about 5 years depending on variety.
705,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"Yeah, sure thing guy. Hail Satan."
1287,best ice cream flavor,The best vanilla ice cream I’ve ever had is “Homemade Vanilla” from Blue Bell. It is only sold in the southern US as far as I know but if you ever come on down here you should give it a try!
60446,Best comedy show on Netflix,Omg that’s amazing. I’ve always thought she was amazing but she is just incredible in this role.
64981,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"South coast is always solid. The Lark seems to be poppin, It’s made the list for sure. All of these look amazing, thank you."
12024,best gifts for dad,"What I love about gifts like that is that while you got something useful, you also affirm that someone, sometime, listens to your rants"

23888,best anime,You aren't alone. Thursdays > Sundays imo
47300,best state to visit in the United States,"Came here to say this! These cities are so fun to visit and they give you a real sense of New England culture. They are “small town cities” in a way. I grew up in New England and now live in NYC, but Portland ME and Portsmouth NH are still some of my favorite cities I’ve ever been too."
29666,best game console,"While those games are fun, I felt they bastardized Battletech."
55497,best action and adventure novel series,Hmm the earlier books of The Wheel Of Time Maybe??!
38432,best newspapers to read,Montreal's Metro. They take most of their articles from the Associated Press and they (mostly) tell when they added their own stuff.
8124,best toothpaste,Can I buy a sonicare at Walgreens?
4450,best text editor,"Not sure why you are getting downvoted. This is 100% true. Sublime feels WAY faster, but in the end, I still end up using VSCode because of its features."
23889,best anime,my man
52507,best hiphop album,Every Lil B album.
34357,best NFL player,Myles Garrett is way too low on this list though if it wasn’t for covid we’d be talking about Myles the dpoy
36869,best roller coaster at six flags,Prioritize Kingda Ka and El Toro. If lines are moving slowly due to restrictions then skip the clones if you've been on them. The safari is cool so check it out too.
23793,best car racing video game,"The customization in PC2 is good? I like to play with 'prettier' cars, like Ferraris, Lamborghinis and etc, not really looking for F1/racing cars. I quite like the dynamic weather and realistic simulation of PC2, but on the other hand, GT Sport apparently is receiving free updates with new cars and tracks, while PC2 charges for the packs.  


So... PC2 or GT Sport? Hahaha"
