17599,best iOS game,It looks like it was last updated last week though?
33580,best electric car,"This was near the top of the list to replace my Model 3! The free fast charging was a huge draw, plus the amazing value for money. 

Ultimately went Mach-E, but I think of the ID.4 often."
19880,best workout music,“Judas” and “Running With The Bulls” by Fozzy are some good ones
58501,best cologne,It's a great fragrance. It's very distinctive. Unfortunately I had an ex who wore it so it's ruined for me but it has the desired effect. Whenever I smell  it I think of him.
35310,best alcoholic drink,"Maybe you should try a nice, refreshing lager beer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5gQ_rruDmc"
13382,best spreadsheet editor,My claims primarily seem off-base due to lack of familiarity with the topic. Most of my posts/comments are about mathematics/cryptography/physics and (theorectical) computer science. So it's understandable to not get my points if you don't have enough background knowledge to know the basis.
16134,best sunglasses for fashion,I love my Knockarounds and they sell Polarized ones too!!
5424,best home improvement store,"Lowes, but I'm in Canada. They have people in the store who actually help you rather than running away.

Mind you, their nuts and bolts section sucks."
62958,Best Data Science textbook,"This can't be emphasized enough. 

Not sure why so many people hear things like ""shortage of workers"" and ""six figure salaries"" and think ""I bet I could break into that field if I just read a few books or do a three-week bootcamp.""

(This isn't an attack on you kugkfokj, just a minor rant)"

32477,best vacation resort,Where is your departure point? Does the $1300 budget include airfare?
73637,best battery bank,"50 pounds for 20,000mAh... I'd pony up for a good Anker or similar. I see they have a 20,000mAh ""PowerCore Essential"" with one USB A and a USB C port on it for for $50US before $10 off on Amazon right now.

I have the 10,000mAh version and use the USB C port a ton. I'd REALLY like it if it had two, but oh well.

I can't recall I've seen ANY that will put out 95W. I've got one of the 20,000 OmniCharge units that has USB C, and I know it will push 45W to my XPS13, but I don't know how much more it could do. And it's a $200 unit.  (just checked, it will go up to 100W output (and has two C ports) and 45W input)

I also have the older original OmniCharge that has an inverter and a US plug on it... it'll output up to 100W that way, but you'd end up needing a wall charger to run a laptop off of, and that would introduce some inefficiencies.

USB C PD *ALL THE THINGS!!!*"
31925,best hotel to live in,"try not being so butt-hurt when a customer service app doesn't work.  They have a phone number. You can mention it to em when you call.   Their service is hotel stays, so what if their technology app isn't up to par, they still offer quality rooms at low rates."
18467,best YouTube video,"'Bout that time, eh chap?

Right o"
18877,best YouTube video,"I have considered ASMR to be somewhat of a strange phenomenon. From what I've seen earlier it was just cute girls with a soothing voice shaking and scratching random objects making it seem like a strange fetish to me, but this video right here makes me understand the appeal. They put a lot of effort into this one to really make it feel like you're submerged in a kind of futuristic world. Thanks for posting this."

28389,best breakfast foods,I came here to say the same thing. I love it with a banana.
13529,best research paper archive,The place most people contact me requesting a copy of my papers is on researchgate and I don't check that regularly. I do eventually send them a copy but it can be weeks later and I always wonder if they still care.
42845,best detective show,Dang it really is sad girl summer
6969,best iPhone,"Best: iPhone 11 Pro. Great design, best battery life. 

Worst: iPhone SE 2020. Gets too much credit than deserved. I’m not fond of its battery life."
33043,best energy drink,"Have a look here: https://www.caffeineinformer.com/energy-drinks-caffeine

The standard is around 80mg/8fl oz though for energy drinks. 

Espresso coffees are quite strong but a different category drink…"

70463,best major to study in college,"They always think they are better and that everyone else is beneath them.  They're cocky, arrogant, and self centered."
