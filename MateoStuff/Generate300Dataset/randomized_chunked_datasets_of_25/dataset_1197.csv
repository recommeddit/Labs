13382,My claims primarily seem off-base due to lack of familiarity with the topic. Most of my posts/comments are about mathematics/cryptography/physics and (theorectical) computer science.

73637,"50 pounds for 20,000mAh... I'd pony up for a good Anker or similar. I see they have a 20,000mAh ""PowerCore Essential"" with one USB A and a USB C port on it for for $50US before $10 off on Amazon right now.

I have the 10,000mAh version and use the USB C port a ton. I'd REALLY like it if it had two, but oh well.

I can't recall I've seen ANY that will put out 95W. I've got one of the 20,000 OmniCharge units that has USB C, and I know it will push 45W to my XPS13, but I don't know how much more it could do. And it's a $200 unit.  (just checked, it will go up to 100W output (and has two C ports) and 45W input)

I also have the older original OmniCharge that has an inverter and a US plug on it... it'll output up to 100W that way, but you'd end up needing a wall charger to run a laptop off of, and that would introduce some inefficiencies.

From what I've seen earlier it was just cute girls with a soothing voice shaking and scratching random objects making it seem like a strange fetish to me, but this video right here makes me understand the appeal. They put a lot of effort into this one to really make it feel like you're submerged in a kind of futuristic world. Thanks for posting this.",best YouTube video
