"this is a great tip, and something I've never considered! thanks!"
"I'm so glad somebody posted this and its so upvoted. I've had people give me shit for saying this, that they knew who Soze was the whole time etc etc etc.  I was so captivated by that movie my jaw was damn near literally on the floor at the end of that movie.

To anyone who has never seen it, don't read a single thing about it before watching it and put your fucking phone down while its on. It's an experience."
"the alien abduction was pretty much just a plot device, he could have been abducted by the mafia or Atlantis."

"Your Electrek article says: ""Ford told Marques Brownlee, a prolific tech YouTuber, that the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck’s 300-mile range is their expectation of the estimated EPA range with 1,000 lbs of cargo.""

Nobody said one thing about a trailer. They clearly meant 1000 lbs in the bed/cabin, which will only affect range by 5-10%. And a 367 mile range estimate on the display means nothing. It was a prototype, which might not have been calibrated yet. Or might have had an oversized battery. Or might have been driven slowly from 100-80% SOC (some displays estimate range based on recent driving conditions). It might have even been set to metric, lol.

Ford says the Pro will get 230 miles EPA. It'll probably come in 10-20 miles higher. And will get maybe 200 miles at 70 mph, and more like 125 miles when towing a full height, lightweight trailer. It still looks like a great truck, just don't buy into the 400 mile hype."
If you're patient and look around you can generally spot a sale to get them at OP's price
"Same! I remember wearing it in Grade 10 (am 31 now) and I walked into my class and the girls were like ""Oh my god who is wearing Light Blue"". They loved it."
"There is growing evidence that triclosan has toxic properties in addition to quite valid concerns that its ubiquitous use is speeding the process of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

"I'm  huge MCU fan and have seen all the movies multiple times, even the stinkers. I'd highly recommend the following curated list in this particular order. I basically tried to give you the cream of the crop while also condensing the giant storyllne from 23 films down to 8. I actually think this flows quite nicely and, if I'm correct, I don't think there will even be any plotholes. From Iron Man to Avengers, it skips four films, but those four films are pretty much summarized in the exposition during the opening fifteen minutes of Avengers. Captain America: Winter Soldier skips ahead a couple of films, but you aren't missing anything. You then take a break from the main storyline for a b-story with Guardians of the Galaxy: new characters, new world, but it's worth it because it's one of the better crafted films and you'll need it for when you get to Infinity War and Endgame. Civil War picks up the main story immediately where you left off in Winter Soldier. Thor: Ragnarok takes you up to speed with what has been going on with Thor in another galaxy and that film ends in a cliffhanger that picks up directly in Infinity War. Infinity War and Endgame serve as Part I and Part II of the epic conclusion. You will need Netflix for Infinity War, but everything else is available on Disney Plus.

I'm actually glad you asked for this and am proud of my abridged adaptation. Not only does the story flow well with these, but I also think these are the best films! I think i'm going to watch along with you in this order should you decide to take me up on it!

1. Iron Man
2. The Avengers
3. Captain America: Winter Soldier
4. Guardians of the Galaxy
5. Captain America: Civil War
6. Thor: Ragnarok
7. Avengers: Infinity War
8. Avengers: Endgame"

"Ok, anyone else having a problem with the Great Lakes of North America not being depicted on this map? Being from Ohio, this looks like the cartographer just said ""eff it, nobody cares about stupid lakes anyways, I've got rules to follow."""
It's better to learn the basics before jumping into LFS. Unless the goal is for the newbie to only retain 1% of what he did.

I did the DBrand grip on my XS max and it had some pretty sharp edges around the bottom speaker ports that dug into my pinky real bad. Eventually gave up on it even though I had a limited print skin because I couldn’t keep slicing my pinky.
"thank you!! i haven't had any cocktails since i couldn't order legally in restaurants and don't go to parties, but i do like flavoured soju and white wines :) i've seen moscow mules mentioned a few times, i may need to find this!! and wow, i've never heard of a birthday cake shot!"
I love your flair- my TBR is going to be out of control after this post as well. Eep! I will check these out. Thank you!
"I would lean towards 2 being the main reason. You may think it’s fairly straightforward but when you have 40 emails from class students 9 from your graduate students, your own research and 4 grants that need to be written and awarded to continue your program and you haven’t made your slides for class next week yet, general public emails tend to go unanswered. I say as I browse reddit at the gym."
I wouldn't have ever thought of that! Great idea! Thank you!
