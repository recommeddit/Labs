"Tough to pick...

- **Versace The Dreamer:** This one's for me and me alone, I know it's divisive :)
- **Prada Luna Rossa Carbon:** When I don't want to think about what to wear
- **Hermes Eau de Rhubarbe Écarlate:** When I want to feel relaxed, indoors or outdoors
- **MFK Aqua Celestia Forte:** S/S all-rounder
- **Nishane Ani:** F/W all-rounder

Especially tough picking Aqua Celestia Forte for S/S, I like Nishane Wulong Cha and Silver Mountain Water too."
"Well, Bester's *The Stars My Destination* is quite short so that makes for a quick start (great book!). Of the others four Reynolds is my personal favorite (though I like *House Of Suns* better than Rev Space, and it's a standalone)."
"Did you think about using LTS versions of Ubuntu instead of Debian stable? If yes, how do they compare in your opinion? Pros, cons, ..."

"I’m sure Apple has included some software trickery to minimize the amount of time display elements are kept in the same spot, considering the status bar at the top, etc. 

Also, Apple sources high quality displays for their iPhones, both in terms of LCDs and OLEDs. I imagine the higher end screens are a bit less susceptible to burn in.

Source: replaced a screen on my old iPhone 5s with a third party. That screen was *very* inferior."
He's not overstating the filth of New Orleans as much as he is understating the filth of San Francisco.
Yeah I personally just couldn't get into it. I watched like five episodes. Laughed like once. Wasn't for me.
"Wow I never knew that Mr. Lincoln debated the legitimacy of the declarations made by Polk about the attacks, to be honest I don't deny that they happened but I do question the fact it was done on US soil. Such a shame that more people didn't side with him, what a great man indeed may he rest in peace.

P.s: Thank you for the comment  and for the AP information."
"A cooking TV Show here in Denmark, once made a smoked herring ice cream. I wish I could say it came out delicious, but I'm afraid it didn't seem like a big success."
I added that. Thanks!
"I bartend in Philadelphia and Charles comes to our bar in the summer about once a month. I finally got to be working when he came in. He was so nice, bought everyone in the bar multiple rounds of shots, picked up tabs, and was just partying with everyone. Tipped us very generously, then when we re-opened our kitchen to make his lady friend a snack (fries and mac n' cheese), he gave our cook $100. He was joking around with us, and remembered my name when he came back in after filming his show with all the other sportscasters. YAY CHARLES!"
"Finally, some real science!"

"Man I'm right here with all you guys

Turning 30 this year.

I haven't heard of Any of these rappers.


Went through and made some new wpotify playlist though.

"I would say not to do this. Here's the reason and some examples.

If someone is really into something, there's probably a very specific item that they want. Depending on what it is that they're ""into"" there may be different products out there with varying levels of quality. Best to leave it to the expert to figure out what they want in this case.

Example: my brothers and I like to play disc golf. My aunt and uncle know this and got us all some discs at Target or Walmart or something. I really appreciate the thought, but those discs sit in my bedroom unused and will likely never ever get used. They are cheap, very lightweight discs that would probably break the first time they hit a tree. 

Example 2: my fiancée knows I love the guitar. She asked me once for my birthday what *specifically* I wanted that I didn't have and I told her ""a good noise gate"". She had no idea what that meant but she was able to go to a guitar store and ask the professionals there. Yes it was guitar center but she ended up getting me an ISP Decimator which is pretty much exactly what I wanted.

So my point is if someone is ""into"" something don't just guess at what they want. They probably have special tastes or very specific preferences."
"""Another grandchild!""

Fuck no.  I'm done.  No more little booger eaters in my house.  Start bugging my sister about that now, please keep reminding her that she's not even in a relationship right now because I know she loves that."
L'Homme Libre works so well on me. You get absolutely showered by compliments.
