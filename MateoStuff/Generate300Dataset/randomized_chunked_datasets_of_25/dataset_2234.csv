Japanese, but it has subtitles. An English dub is also available.

Disclaimer, it's my favorite film, I've seen it over a dozen times. I have a copy on my phone (of the English dub, my phone's too small for subtitles to be effective) I just watch *when I'm bored*. The twists (there are a few) still get me most of the time.",best movies with a cool twist

22115,"I've met quite a few celebrities. I think the coolest one was Sammy Hagar. I was working across the street from his house (well, his driveway) digging out a fire hydrant that had been covered by a small rock slide. I had been working for a few hours and he walks up behind me. ""Hey, I noticed you've been out here working for a long time - how about a beer?"" He holds out two beers. I tell him I can't because I'm on duty (firefighter). He asks if I'm sure. I tell him that I appreciate the offer but, I can't. He asks if I need water. I tell him that I've got some in my truck. We talk for a little bit, I tell him I like his music. He thanks me for helping to keep the community safe. He takes off after a bit. About an hour later, I finish up. I climb into my truck and find two beers sitting on the front seat.",best celebrity

Get a password manager, regardless if you want to keep the history or not.

> The tracking is done remotely, and they aren't going to allow you to clear that data.

Clearing the local data makes you look like a completely new person to trackers each time you open the browser because the things they store on your computer to track you are gone.

> Only real point in doing this is if you want to keep your significant other (or in some cases, mom) from seeing what you've been doing online.

9720,"Hey, I'm a first year Econ and Accounting major in Santa Cruz Hall. It's great! 45 second walk from the beach. I could give you the typical advice like ""Balance academics and partying"" but honestly it will all come naturally to you. Making friends in the dorms isn't difficult and everybody is just really friendly. If you want to chill, you'll find somebody to chill with. You want to study, you will find somebody to study with. Anything you want to do, you will find somebody to do it with. College has been great so far and I never want it to end. One of my roommates is trying to get into the Mechanical Engineering program...have fun! Who knows, maybe I'll bump into you around campus next year...haha obviously I won't know it's you, but still that would be pretty rad. 

Edit: My advice is not to live at San Cat. I'd shoot for Santa Cruz, Ancapa, Santa Rosa, or San Nic. It's all personal preference though.",best dorm hall at UCSB
