>~~Bill~~ *USPA/Gear manufactures/Americas fucked legal system* shouldn’t deprive young willing teens. Guess it sucks to not be 18.

But yeah I fully agree.  I got in a couple years before they changed that.  The best part of it all was showing up to another DZ on my 18th birthday telling them I wanted to do a jump for it and have them start going into the whole tandem thing then pop out a logbook with 86 jumps in it :)",best places to skydive in california
16503,"I think it will be easier to narrow the range based on your needs/habits.  If you're rough on your glasses, you'll want to make sure you've got a sturdy pair.  If you're athletic and want these to be functional in that scenario, make sure you get a pair that will stay on, even if they're not specifically sport glasses.  I love aviators but couldn't stand them when I had long hair because I would always slide them up to rest on top of my head when I didn't need them, and the nose pieces would get stuck in my hair; with a pixie cut, now I love them!

I do love me some polarized lens, and I highly recommend them.  That does rule out some options, though.  Many of the fashion brands, even pricier ones, don't have a lot of polarized options.  Can't for the life of me figure out why.  As /u/bossyfosy said, you may want to have more than one pair for different purposes.  

Personally, I'm cheap with eyewear because I lose things like that so much.  I found a pair of rayban aviators buried in the sand on the beach one day, and within a couple months I had crushed them.  Free lesson for me: expensive sunglasses would not be a good investment!  YMMV, but I've been pretty happy with the $20 pair of no-brand polarized aviators I picked up at Target last summer.",best sunglasses for fashion

1947,"Pre-vegan, I always liked Patxi's pizza for their deep-dish which was close to a Chicago deep-dish (I lived there.) I also ate Patxi's when I lived in San Fran. Post-vegan, I still eat at Patxi's for the vegan deep dish, yum.  For regular pizza (non-vegan,) give Olio Pizzeria a try, gourmet type pizzas with a wood oven, delicious, try their umbra pizza (truffle pizza)...OMG, the bomb.

Now that I am vegan, whole foods fresh foods makes a good vegan pizza, but besides that I make my own. Never liked Rusty's, and Blaze Pizza was the worst.",best pizza place in Santa Barbara
