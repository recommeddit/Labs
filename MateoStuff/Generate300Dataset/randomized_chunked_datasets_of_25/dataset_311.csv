60300,best freezer brand,"I am an out of sight, out of mind personality and that didn't suit me when I had a CHEST freezer-i would quite simply forget what i had, or something would get put on top of something else and get 'buried'. I didn't have the discipline to make a list or rotate stock frequently."

>~~Bill~~ *USPA/Gear manufactures/Americas fucked legal system* shouldn’t deprive young willing teens. Guess it sucks to not be 18.

But yeah I fully agree.  I got in a couple years before they changed that.  The best part of it all was showing up to another DZ on my 18th birthday telling them I wanted to do a jump for it and have them start going into the whole tandem thing then pop out a logbook with 86 jumps in it :)"
16503,best sunglasses for fashion,"I think it will be easier to narrow the range based on your needs/habits.  If you're rough on your glasses, you'll want to make sure you've got a sturdy pair.  If you're athletic and want these to be functional in that scenario, make sure you get a pair that will stay on, even if they're not specifically sport glasses.  I love aviators but couldn't stand them when I had long hair because I would always slide them up to rest on top of my head when I didn't need them, and the nose pieces would get stuck in my hair; with a pixie cut, now I love them!

I do love me some polarized lens, and I highly recommend them.  That does rule out some options, though.  Many of the fashion brands, even pricier ones, don't have a lot of polarized options.  Can't for the life of me figure out why.  As /u/bossyfosy said, you may want to have more than one pair for different purposes.  

Personally, I'm cheap with eyewear because I lose things like that so much.  I found a pair of rayban aviators buried in the sand on the beach one day, and within a couple months I had crushed them.  Free lesson for me: expensive sunglasses would not be a good investment!  YMMV, but I've been pretty happy with the $20 pair of no-brand polarized aviators I picked up at Target last summer."

38233,best newspapers to read,"Agreed. The WSJ is still respectable by any means, but Murdoch's influence can be seen in the stories chosen and the perspective ""neutral"" article take. The best recent example of this are Net Neutrality pieces. Also when their Opinion section has article legitimately defending ""Intelligent Design""... it used to be much better."

1947,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Pre-vegan, I always liked Patxi's pizza for their deep-dish which was close to a Chicago deep-dish (I lived there.) I also ate Patxi's when I lived in San Fran. Post-vegan, I still eat at Patxi's for the vegan deep dish, yum.  For regular pizza (non-vegan,) give Olio Pizzeria a try, gourmet type pizzas with a wood oven, delicious, try their umbra pizza (truffle pizza)...OMG, the bomb.

Now that I am vegan, whole foods fresh foods makes a good vegan pizza, but besides that I make my own. Never liked Rusty's, and Blaze Pizza was the worst."
