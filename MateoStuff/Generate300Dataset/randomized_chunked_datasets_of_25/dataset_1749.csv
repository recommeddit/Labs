It's hard for me to pick favorite beats for some reason. Partly that's because I know some of the best beats are probably deep cuts on albums I havent listened to as much. I also think the more mainstream trap beats have gotten kind of stale lately. Beatwise I'm much more interested in whats coming from people like Alchemist and L'Orange and August Fannon. Still hard for me to pick favorite tracks though.

Favorite artist I've ""discovered"" this year has probably been Pink Siifu. I've been aware of him for a while but his music hasn't clicked with me till recently. Been playing Ensley more and Negro a couple times, although that one is not an easy listen. 

As for albums I've liked that other people haven't - maybe Jim Jones, I liked Th1rt33n (Pharaoh Monche) not sure how people like that, and I kinda liked the Kevin Gates mixtape. 

I need to listen to that Mach Hommy shit more, it probably belongs on this list."

35199,best alcoholic drink,"I miss the old Captain Morgan rum. It's nearly a premium brand now, I liked it when it was bottom-shelf and had a kick."
55539,best action and adventure novel series,"Aye, i loved them. Logen Ninefingers is a legend of a character! I'd highly recommend the 3 stand alone books as well"
66025,best college in california,Lots of employers I know prefer grads from CSU over UC for that reason.
55989,best action and adventure movie,"If you by adventure movie you literally just mean a movie depicting an adventure then this may apply.

But Lost City of Z is more of a slow burn. Not really what I think OP is after."
13444,best spreadsheet editor,"Was getting some awesomeness out of it using HTTP calls to collect XML data, and then perform some operations.

But soon hit limits and ... back to excel.

Was editing google spreadsheets inside of EVE Online's browser (based off of Chrome), and that was very cool.  But that broke.

Still it is awesome for very many things and use it for a lot of work, though none of the workbooks on their own are very impressive.  Google has been my go-to place to manage notes, logs, and documentation I generate.

But for making magic happen, Excel is still the hottest chick at the party."
61897,Best RPG game on PS4,"Okay, magic goes back to FF. 

The thunder, fire, ice system. I just thought it was neat how GG did it. 


I just thought Horizon was going to be more like Uncharted less like it was.


My points for weapons is what it is it. Its mostly a positive point for the game itself. A lot of RPGs limit you to one weapon/weapon type


Yeah CoD is incorporating RPG elements but I wouldn't put it in my type 5 RPGs.


Horizon was a surprise genre classification for me. I honestly thought it wasn't going to be the way it was."
56575,best desktop monitor,"yeah i dont really understand it so much either. 

I dont know if its just me but max settings on most games look horrendous. Especially in Fortnite"
65456,best phone service company,"Ah, I hadn't.  I messed around with MVNO options in the APN setting as mentioned in that thread, but no luck.  Guess I have to contact Red Pocket to get them to activate if I want it."

28435,best breakfast foods,"So you get potassium, fiber and caffeine? All at a modest calorie intake? Pretty good there, bud."
57065,best water brand,"Opposite for me, it's my favorite besides Smart Water. I like distilled water too.

I think I just really dislike chlorine-flavor, which I why I often don't like tap water."
37703,best Marvel movie,Infinity War and Iron Man 3
39151,best web browser,microsoft browsers have always been so far behind the development curve its not funny. Amazingly bad by comparison with alternatives for many many years. Nice to see they are pulling their fingers out with this offering.
71472,best movies with a cool twist,"As someone who never saw Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane was a hell of a surprise. Made me go back and watch both but in order this time."
