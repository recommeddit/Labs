It's hard for me to pick favorite beats for some reason. Partly that's because I know some of the best beats are probably deep cuts on albums I havent listened to as much. I also think the more mainstream trap beats have gotten kind of stale lately. Beatwise I'm much more interested in whats coming from people like Alchemist and L'Orange and August Fannon. Still hard for me to pick favorite tracks though.

Favorite artist I've ""discovered"" this year has probably been Pink Siifu. I've been aware of him for a while but his music hasn't clicked with me till recently. Been playing Ensley more and Negro a couple times, although that one is not an easy listen. 

As for albums I've liked that other people haven't - maybe Jim Jones, I liked Th1rt33n (Pharaoh Monche) not sure how people like that, and I kinda liked the Kevin Gates mixtape. 

I need to listen to that Mach Hommy shit more, it probably belongs on this list.",best rap album

But soon hit limits and ... back to excel.

Was editing google spreadsheets inside of EVE Online's browser (based off of Chrome), and that was very cool.  But that broke.

Still it is awesome for very many things and use it for a lot of work, though none of the workbooks on their own are very impressive.  Google has been my go-to place to manage notes, logs, and documentation I generate.

But for making magic happen, Excel is still the hottest chick at the party.",best spreadsheet editor

The thunder, fire, ice system. I just thought it was neat how GG did it. 


I just thought Horizon was going to be more like Uncharted less like it was.


My points for weapons is what it is it. Its mostly a positive point for the game itself. A lot of RPGs limit you to one weapon/weapon type


Yeah CoD is incorporating RPG elements but I wouldn't put it in my type 5 RPGs.
