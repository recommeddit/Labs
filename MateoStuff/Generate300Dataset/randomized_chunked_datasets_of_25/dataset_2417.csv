52729,"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned To Pimp a Butterfly and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. No one in Hip-Hop so far has attempted to create albums which are more artistically ambitious than these two.

But then again I'm 2010s head so there's definitely bias in my picks. Illmatic, The Infamous, Ready To Die, Madvillainy are very strong contenders as well.",best hiphop album
29585,"I began playing video games on a PS2 when I was a young kid, despite now being an exclusive member of the PCMR (though I do use Dolphin, and PS2 and PSX emulators).

My favorite games were Kingdom Hearts, Sly Cooper series, Crash Bandicoot series, Jak and Daxter series, Spyro series, and the Ratchet and Clank series.

I also owned Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, which I loved so much and I would always play that with friends when I could invite them over *reminisces*. 

You also seem to forget Shadow of the Colossus, which I'm sure many people would say is an amazing PlayStation game.

Upvoted you because you not only reminded me of my childhood, but because I can relive amazing gaming moments with emulators.

Praise you, brother.

EDIT: Silent Hill 2 if I recall correctly is EXTREMELY difficult to find for PC. I'm not sure about Silent Hill 3, because I have only bothered with 2 (Heard Silent Hill 2 is the best of the series).

EDIT 2:
You actually do have Shadow of the Colossus, albeit the HD remake on PS3.",best game console
