"I equated being in a textbook to being famous, which would imply being financially well off as an artist. It is incredibly rare to have an artist living off of the money they make from being an artist."
Yeah I didn’t actually watch it. But my wife was telling me about it and she had only good things to say.
"Probably you won't read this but... Oblivion was the the Elder Scrolls that I enjoyed the less. Probably because Cyrodill is the classic set up for high fantasy. It has good things like the Oblivion gates and such, but the faction quests ... can't talk good about them.   
Skyrim is definitely an improvement.   
But.... in regards of magic system and set up, Morrowind kicks their buts."
"No worries man, I will say finding a romantic option in this game is fun as hell."
"Mika.  I don't have a glamorous life.  

Oh, also Richard Dawkins, whom I thought to be a bit of a cock-end.  And was once almost run over by Joseph Fiennes, who called me a ""fucking imbecile""."
"This is my go-to for both my parents. They're well off enough and if there's something specific they want, they just get it themselves anyway. So I always make sure I come by and make them a nice dinner, bring a bottle of wine and just have a great time together."
"This is my answer too. Tom Holland is very close behind, in my opinion, and he wins if we're only talking about live action.  Yuri Lowenthal killed it though."
Stop I'm at my desk. At least let me pretend to be working
"yeah, they're able to actually have the orchestra when the real money came in from the PS4 sales in October. Hopefully, this can surpass DQ8"

"Tanqueray 10 and Schweppes. Lots of ice, large glass, fresh lime juice. Adult Sprite."
"It's an annual fee, $50 per year."
"That's what we all want to know in the Windows subreddit.  (Don't get me wrong, I love Linux)"
"Mom's usually always love pictures. New and old. Have some professional pictures done of you, your family, your kids and frame them. Maybe find some old pictures and have them reprinted and framed."
Lmao
worn weight.
"Tom has been the best Peter by far IMO.

His Spidey needs a ton of work though. None of them have nailed Spidey though Garfield got the closest."
"I disagree. Mechanical Engineering is the real skeleton key, not Computer Science. Computer Science is a fantastic compliment, but I don’t think it’s that great as the main focus. I’m not saying it’s a bad degree. Though, I think it eventually might be if things keep progressing like they are."
"I completely agree with you. I lived 30 minutes from the southern Adirondack many years ago, and hiked 38 of her peaks. My roommate from CA was always impressed by the ruggedness of the terrain and the difficulty of the climbing. Lots of great memories."
Rlly?

"It is a rather complex literature.
But, with me, it was a matter of getting used to the literary genre!"
