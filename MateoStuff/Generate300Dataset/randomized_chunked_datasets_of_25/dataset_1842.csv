29747,"Yes, but the ROI is insane.  My annual YNAB fee has saved me *thousands of dollars.*  

It blew mint away, which ultimately just nagged me but did not change my behavior one bit.  YNAB was like a brutal spiritual journey where I had to confront my own consumerism and come to terms with the idea that desire is infinite and will never be satiated no matter what I bought, but my bank accounts are most definitely finite.  It sucked.  But now I'm debt free and have a six month buffer and am saving for a house.  YNAB will make me rich, someday.

Oh, it also made my marriage stronger.  We are literally on the same page financially.  That also took some time to get there but it was worth every single squabble and compromise.",best money managing app

45287,"I've personally always been a fan of Xbox. It's where many of my friends are, and I love some of the games.

I also have a PS4, but don't really use it much....mainly for a few of the exclusives.

I enjoyed Nintendo as a kid, but kinda ""grew out"" of many of those games. There's still a few that I'd love to try, but my tastes have changed.

PC is going to give the best graphics, won't charge for online, and has a large variety of games available.

.

Really, it's going to come down to what type of games you want to play.

If you already have a PC, I'd probably stick with that for the short term, and figure out which genre of games you enjoy the most.

Once you decide that it will be easier to figure out which console to get - as they really shine in different areas.

If you don't have a PC currently, I'd recomend the Xbox One S. It's a nice console, and probably one of the cheapest options currently.

.

Next Gen consoles are probably \~18 months out at this point.

So, I wouldn't go spending a ton of money on any current gen console if you think you'll want to get into next-gen.",best gaming system
