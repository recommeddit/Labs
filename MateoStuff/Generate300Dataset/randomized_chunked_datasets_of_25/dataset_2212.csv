5191,best home improvement store,"HD will take back anything within a year of purchase with a receipt? I purchased a tool as a gift back in May and the person already had the tool. I lost the receipt and they declined the return (their computer printed a little reciept and they couldn't do anything about it). So I've been stuck with this tool I have no use for. However, I logged onto my account online and the purchase was done by credit card and it's recorded there. So will they take it back now that it's been 7 months? I haven't used it, it's new in the package still."

Best of luck!"
40937,best instrument to play,"Saxophone was my fist instrument in grade school, followed by guitar and I recently picked up violin.  The saxophone was BY FAR the easiest of the three, it allowed me to learn to read music without getting frustrated and introduced me to improvisation, which translated beautifully to my understanding of guitar.  The hardest part of the saxophone was the neck strain from the cheap ass strap that came with the thing."
7290,best iPhone,"I’m personally upgrading to the iPhone 12 this Winter mainly for the OLED screen, but if you don’t care about that, I can definitely see it being good for your uses 4-5 years down the line. Not sure how long Apple will support it, but it probably won’t be as bad of a slow down as the iPhone 4/4S on its final iOS update"
44514,best items under $100,"They make those Velcro ones too.. if you move a good bit, or have brick/concrete walls, they’re amazing for hanging pictures and stuff. 

And then once you move there’s no need to spackle and sand over nail holes. You just pull a little tab and it pulls the adhesive off underneath the Velcro, and I haven’t seen it damage paint yet"
58823,best cologne,"The only warning I have is to make sure you know what intensity you're getting. Aftershave will be the least intense, followed by eau de toilette. This is generally what most male fragrances is. The most intense is eau de parfum. I would only recommend it for people like me who have a skin effect that kills the scent quicker than it should."

43611,best items under $100,"Or an old school home ec textbook. Found one at a thrift shop and it’s from the early 60s and it’s awesome. It’ll teach just plain old home cooking, but also includes stuff I’ve never seen in other cookbooks. For example, how to time everything so it all comes out at once, a chapter on cooking for the ill, and there’s also a dated chapter on losing or gaming weight. Budgeting is also a big part, as well as just planning tasty, balanced meals."

10657,best suitcase lock,"I haven't flown in about 2 years, so not sure if this has changed, but TSA will cut padlocks off your luggage.  I had left the little padlock on one of my zipper tabs not even connecting it to any of the other tabs and TSA cut the tabs off of all my zipper tabs.  Made it a pain in the ass to open and close my luggage."

10818,best suitcase lock,"Airline ""lost"" my luggage on vacation once. They called me to pick it up and I left the luggage key at my grandma's house. They were gonna send me back and my cousin who works at the airport stepped in. She's like stop bullshitting and just check her bags. She took out a pen and opened it right in front of everyone. All other people picking up their lost luggage looked pretty shocked."

69950,best major to study in college,"> Film

Don't go to film school. Go to films and make movies. You'll save a shit ton of money that you won't be able to payback and you'll actually have made something. I'm fully aware a shit ton of film majors are about to pop up now and shit all over this opinion. If you value your credit, time and effort just make films and save thousands of dollars.

63541,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"I don´t know why it has so much discussions about package managers. I mean, how often i use Cydia, maybe 4-5 times in a week. The question i ask me, how many people use it many time in a day? What and how much tweaks install and deinstall they so often?

When i use Cydia, i don´t care if it refresh the sources in maybe 20 sec. or in 10 sec. The most important thing for me is that it works. It does not matter if the UI looks a bit older or not..."
