5191,"HD will take back anything within a year of purchase with a receipt? I purchased a tool as a gift back in May and the person already had the tool. I lost the receipt and they declined the return (their computer printed a little reciept and they couldn't do anything about it). So I've been stuck with this tool I have no use for. However, I logged onto my account online and the purchase was done by credit card and it's recorded there. So will they take it back now that it's been 7 months? I haven't used it, it's new in the package still.",best home improvement store

40937,"Saxophone was my fist instrument in grade school, followed by guitar and I recently picked up violin.  The saxophone was BY FAR the easiest of the three, it allowed me to learn to read music without getting frustrated and introduced me to improvisation, which translated beautifully to my understanding of guitar.  The hardest part of the saxophone was the neck strain from the cheap ass strap that came with the thing.",best instrument to play

And then once you move there’s no need to spackle and sand over nail holes. You just pull a little tab and it pulls the adhesive off underneath the Velcro, and I haven’t seen it damage paint yet",best items under $100

It’ll teach just plain old home cooking, but also includes stuff I’ve never seen in other cookbooks. For example, how to time everything so it all comes out at once, a chapter on cooking for the ill, and there’s also a dated chapter on losing or gaming weight. Budgeting is also a big part, as well as just planning tasty, balanced meals.",best items under $100

Don't go to film school. Go to films and make movies. You'll save a shit ton of money that you won't be able to payback and you'll actually have made something. I'm fully aware a shit ton of film majors are about to pop up now and shit all over this opinion. If you value your credit, time and effort just make films and save thousands of dollars.
