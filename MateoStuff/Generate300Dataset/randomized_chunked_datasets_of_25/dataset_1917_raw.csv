Avoid Fedora. It's like a beta for future RHEL software. This means it can be unpredictable~.
"Easily my favorite. Ever since Dane Cook saturation of the 2000's, I feel edgy, shock comedy just doesn't do it for me. Comedians that can bring the humor while still being something I can recommend to friends, family, and co-workers without worrying about ""that one part"" every skit seems to have is a relief."
It's just an American version of the superior 'Criminal Justice'.

Oh man.  I spent a day or two at some point going through his stuff.  Really entertaining and amazing production.

"> In theory, you can make a webcam that basically has a smartphone SOC inside it that does all the sophisticated image processing that smartphone cameras can do. However, once you do that, the price of the webcam ballons quickly. Once a webcam costs $300+

You only need look to the fact that amazing camera quality smartphones exists for $100 or less that do everything else a smartphone does, not just capture video, to see why your guess is absolute bullshit. It would barely inflate the cost at all."
"Agreed. Frozen blueberries, cinnamon, honey, chia seeds or protein powder are good additions too!"
"Well you're out of state so you'll pay a lot more. USC definitely costs the most along with Stanford but that's because they are private universities. 

I went to UCLA and I can say, it opened a lot of doors for me. TBH with you both Berkeley and UCLA are considered public ivys so you wouldn't have a problem with alumni networks getting out of school.

The CSU's don't have as good a reputation but they're more cost effective. If you had the choice, definitely UC over CSU.

As for Stanford and USC they speak for themselves. USC, hard for me to admit has an incredible alumni network all over the country. And Stanford, well I don't need to say anything about Stanford.

Note UCLA and Berkeley get a TON of applications so hopefully you're a well rounded student. It's not enough anymore to get just good grades, you have to have extracurriculars, great SAT scores and like a great personal statement.

Either way you choose to go to school at the UCs you get the prestige but it'll cost you a pretty penny."
"If this were New Hampshire, there would be a highway running through the valley."
"Anytime something from a movie takes me away from it then it’s like a deduction for me. And with TWS it doesn’t really do that. 

Look at ragnarok for example. There was too much comedy in it although it was written fairly well. It was a dark movie but it was just too cheerful. 

With TWS it all just synced. It’s the first Marvel movie that showed how amazing the films could be. I’ll always give props to the Russos and Markus & McFeely for that"
"He willingly gave up the dictatorship after doing what he thought would save the Republic from destruction. Sure his methods were... unsound... but it was a desperate effort. He proscribed the wrong people. Had Caesar not been spared, the Republic might had been sustained."

"My sister is friends with Demi. She's told me horrible things they used to do together. Demi was in fact a mean girl and her campaign for bullying was after she got famous and was called fat by fans. I've got so many stories about her. And the few times that I did meet her, she gave me such a ""I'm better than you"" feel."
