"I don't remember what the economic theory is, but it was talking about how the rich stay rich because they don't have to spend as much money.  A good pair of boots costs $50 (this was from a long time ago...) and would last several years.  A cheap pair of boots costs $10, and after a couple of months the cardboard would wear out and your feet would get all wet in the rain.  Workers can't afford good boots, so they have to buy cheap boots.  Since they buy cheap boots, they have to be replaced every few months.  A poor person buys 10 pairs of cheap boots in the time a wealthy person only has to buy the one pair of good boots.  The same works for food - the poor person buying low quality fast food pays less per meal than the rich person buying high quality groceries or going to nice restaurants, but the poor person has much more health problems related to their diet, and probably worse insurance, if any, so they pay way more for health care / lose money from time off being sick.

tl;ldr - put the few extra bucks down for some Audio Technica ATH-M50s"

"For $100 I bought my dad an introductory flight lesson through Groupon.  

He flew a single prop plane around for an hour with a certified instructor, who handled the takeoff, landing, and navigation, but my dad was behind the stick the rest of the time. He said it was one of the best gifts he had ever received. Cheers!  

Edit: It was also worth it just to see my mom freak out the whole time."
"I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve listened to any of these in their entirety, definitely checking them out now"
"I feel like a 14 year old girl wearing it because it's so overwhelmingly sweet but I love it so much 

All my sprays and perfumes are embarrassingly sweet-smelling"
What goes on the room next to you.   This week we to evict and have arrested a couple for causing over $15K in damages to a room.  This was done quietly late at night and the nearby rooms never found out.
My concern was how much faster my teeth would get ruined if my water has no fluoride
Jean Paul Gaultier. It never fails to make me turn my head when a guy walks by.
"I see. I'd go with the ASUS Zenbook 14 on my list. Ryzen 7 5700U, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD, and a 1080p 14"" IPS 400 nit display. It should be fine for general use programs."

Garfield was a good Spider-Man

Holland, so far, is the best of both"

For me at least it isnt enough to just brush my tounge. Gotta use the right tools for the job."

"Beyond promoting your app and getting the word out, how are you monetizing the users that you are getting?"
The FDA has nothing to do with it. It actually was sold over the counter in the US at one time. When GlaxoSmithKline bought the company that made it they pulled it and only let it be sold through dentists offices. I buy mine on Amazon from the UK.
"I wish I could upvote you twice.  Played well, nothing is as beautiful as a violin."
"I think it's easily the worst excluding Cruel Summer. Terrible lyrics, sub par production by his standards, sounds like a rushed mixtape, so much filler, just generally not very good."
"Decided to respond because of your edit. 

I have a finance and law degree. I took finance because I thought it was interesting, challenging and a good degree to have. Not sure how useful it was but it was tough and it has been helpful for my personal investing. 

If you're interested I would definitely do some research into the lifestyle of a lawyer. The money isn't what many expect, the hours aren't either. 

Going to law school also threw a big wrench in my finances. Not sure if it will ever pay off, I was making a decent career before law. 

Not sure if I would change anything at this time but I definitely could have taken an easier undergrad.  The work I do as a lawyer currently doesn't really require much of my financial background"

"I'm with a Samsung CHG70 (C27HG70) which is 1440p, 144Hz, VA panel, 10-bit color depth, HDR, FreeSync 2, curved, 1ms, 27 inch. All that you can expect for a purrfect gaming monitor ðŸ˜‚
It also does have ambient light on the back and USB hub that I use for my keyboard and mouse dongles.
I'm happy with that one but don't know if it's sold nowadays, it's near 2 years old now.

There's also the 31.5"" model named C32HG70 that shares same specs and another called CHG90 which is a big overkill ultra-wide (32:9) that shares same specs but being  3840 X 1080.

Also I suppose they released other series with same specs on this two years that should share similar specs with a new series and model name. They price started at 860â‚¬ on release date and last time I saw one it was 499â‚¬

Didn't tried LG gaming monitors, I've a 27UL500-W which is 4K 60hz IPS sRGB 99% which I use for design tasks.

On my GF rig (which all parts that she uses were mine) we've an AOC which works well but definitely the quality of materials is far to the quality of a Samsung or an LG even being one of the expensive models back those days (fullHD 144Hz 1ms Freesync, USB hub, shitty TN panel, adjustable base...) But it does the trick as she mainly play e-sports games to stream on twitch"
