19917,"I recommend expanding your taste in music. hip hop is good, and there is SOME stuff bumping enough to trance you during workouts, but it's mostly leisure music, like stuff you roll down the street bumping or do homework to. 

Every type of music has its place

If you really prefer hip hop tho, I recommend Eminem, Jay rock, skepta, big Sean, or any hype rapper like that.

But the energy sustain effects aren't gonna be as good as it would if you bumped heavy metal or something, so don't expect that.

But it doesn't really matter if you donors slow paced stuff.",best workout music
