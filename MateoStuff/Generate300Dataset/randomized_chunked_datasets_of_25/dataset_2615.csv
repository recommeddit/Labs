47972,best color to paint with,"I’d be interested to know where everyone is located and see if there is a difference based on location as well. 

I still get a ton of grey, but it is transitioning to off whites, creams, and whites. 

I’m in central Canada."
62733,Best Data Science textbook,"I agree, it's a really great book that I recommend even to people who don't know R."
17030,best iOS game,Haha. That makes a lot more sense
19917,best workout music,"I recommend expanding your taste in music. hip hop is good, and there is SOME stuff bumping enough to trance you during workouts, but it's mostly leisure music, like stuff you roll down the street bumping or do homework to. 

Every type of music has its place

If you really prefer hip hop tho, I recommend Eminem, Jay rock, skepta, big Sean, or any hype rapper like that.

But the energy sustain effects aren't gonna be as good as it would if you bumped heavy metal or something, so don't expect that.

But it doesn't really matter if you donors slow paced stuff."
6521,best Netflix documentary,"This and The Vietnam war and The War. All by Ken Burns. Music is phenomenal. Downloaded The Civil War album. The Ashokan Farewell will bring tears to your eyes.
Try to combine The War with “Supernova in the East” in the podcast series Hardcore History by Dan Carlin."

Watermelon Red bull is a very close second best.

Worst: original Monster or Most Bang energy drinks (has a bad aftertase)"
52439,best hiphop album,"Your opinion of Illmatic is boring and ridiculous.

It's 10 songs at just under 40 minutes how the fuck can that album be boring.  It's perfectly sequenced, lyrics are flawless along with the production. You make no sense."
33105,best energy drink,"I really like the Amp Lemonade... probably the most delicious energy drink i've tried so far... Also, the Xyience (sp?) energy drinks are really good as well, green apple, mango, razz, and blueberry-guava i think..."

29175,best web hosting service,"The thing I don’t like about BlueHost is that they will increase your monthly fee after a year without warning you! You can buy their package at a discount but what you don’t realise is that once the year is up, the price increases dramatically - for the same service?"
10220,best pencil for drawing,$2 - $3 a piece.
33975,best Pokemon game,If you want a game that is also ridiculously easy for a beginner then I recommend Let's Go Pikachu And Eevee. But if you want something more challenging then it is Black And White as many have recommended here.
