5131,I used to only shop at HD until this spring. Ordered $2k worth of material and they only delivered 1/3 of it. So I waited a week for the other material to come. The driver drove up to my house and he refused to deliver because the road is too busy. Safety should be #1 so I dont blame the guy but the road isnt that busy and last week they delivered it and didnt say anything. Call up home depot and they said there was nothing they could do. Asked for a refund and they said they could only do refunds in the store. I recently went through chemo and didnt want to go into the store. So now I am waiting on getting my money back.... while lowes was able to help me out just fine. I dont get how if I buy something online they cant just refund my card.,best home improvement store
