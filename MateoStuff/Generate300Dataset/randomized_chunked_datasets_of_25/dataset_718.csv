69340,best major to study in college,"My history degree is definitely useless. I'm making ok money in sales, but that has nothing to do with my schooling. I think I would get a finance degree if I cold go back.

The grass is always greener, though. Hard to tell the best option, even in hindsight."

5848,best programming language for web development,"If you're looking to make a very simple webpage, PHP and HTML are definitely the way to go. If you want a more responsive/dynamic design, you have to learn JavaScript. For the server-side software (back end) there's lots of languages you can use, for example PHP, Python, and Java.

In fact, you don't even need a back end. You can _serve_ plain HTML files."
34453,best NFL player,"Thurman Thomas - Buffalo Bills - NFL League MVP 1991

2000+ yards from scrimmage.  12 TDs.

The 10th most TDs by a QB that year was 15.  The 10th most yards was 3100...but only 64% (1984 yards) of that was Air Yards, the rest was Yards After Catch.  In this very case, a player from your team was comparable to the #10 QB in the league."

64731,Best Nike running shoes,"I live in the Portland area (Nike's world HQ and Adidas' NA HQ), and I don't see those brands at the forefront of local running communities.  I know that Nike's made some good running shoes, like the Pegasus, Zoomfly, Vaporfly, Lunarglide, and I occasionally see a 'swoosh' during my runs.  I very rarely, if ever, see Adidas, though."

5131,best home improvement store,I used to only shop at HD until this spring. Ordered $2k worth of material and they only delivered 1/3 of it. So I waited a week for the other material to come. The driver drove up to my house and he refused to deliver because the road is too busy. Safety should be #1 so I dont blame the guy but the road isnt that busy and last week they delivered it and didnt say anything. Call up home depot and they said there was nothing they could do. Asked for a refund and they said they could only do refunds in the store. I recently went through chemo and didnt want to go into the store. So now I am waiting on getting my money back.... while lowes was able to help me out just fine. I dont get how if I buy something online they cant just refund my card.
