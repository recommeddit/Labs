"I don't buy any brand. There's a retailer in my town that sells alkaline water, pH varies between 8 and 9. I get 5 gallons for $7, lasts me about a week"
"Yeah, I see what you're saying man. I didn't really take that into account before."
"Dune, Canticle for Leibowitz, and Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained"
"Yep, agreed. Anytime **Splendor** hits the table, people are all in and want more lol."

De La Soul - 3 Feet High And Rising

Beastie Boys - Paul's Boutique

N.W.A. - Straight Outta Compton

Eric B. & Rakim - Follow the Leader

Dr. Dre - The Chronic

There are many, many other essential albums, but my expertise is in the late 80s/early 90s ;)"
"Personal favorite is a tie between Outkast - Atliens and Mos Def - Black on Both Sides. 


But if a kid who thought Earl/Joey/Kendrick/Cole were the best rappers alive asked me for the best rap album EVER, I'd tell them Blu&Exile - Below The Heavens or OneBeLo - S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M."

Many of the older NFS still hold up because NFS is fundamentally about racing.  So you can't really go wrong with an older version of NFS since the best NFS's were bade between 1997  and 2005 pinnacling with Most wanted in 2005.

Most NFS post 2005 has struggled to attain the quality of 2005 and previous."
"Computer Science and/or Engineering. I’m doing both and as an intern in college the average chap (if you did the math out on a weekly basis) will earn as much if not much more than most other majors will in their first few years after graduation. Again - there are outliers, but generally speaking we earn the most *on average* while also having some of the best demand possible for our professions."
The 3rd movement of Mahler's 3rd symphony has an off stage flugelhorn (similar to trumpet) that plays at a few points and it is magical.

"Definitely my legs, back, and shoulders were the most beneficial. But I have used it on my back, and arms too. They sell all kinds of attachment tips for different areas to target."
"Yeah, I still want cash."
"It runs really well on my laptop. Keeps the fans quiet. A rather minimal install of Arch is faster and snappier, but seems to heat up my laptop and get the fans going. I guess Manjaro comes with some sort of power management already installed, but since I've got no clue as to what exactly, and I'm too lazy to look it up, I just keep using Manjaro.

Since the two things I most value in a laptop is it being quiet and the keyboard being good, I'm all set!"
"The US?  It's in the Northern and Western hemispheres, smack dab in the middle of the North American continent.  You can't miss it.  If you hit Canada you've gone too far and need to circle back."

"Dream Quest

Best rogue-like CCG on iOS.

A game that you can simultaneously play for 5-10 mins at a time and will take up all of your free time!"
"Whichever makes its way to A12 first.

But in all seriousness, I prefer Sileo from the demo I tried. It’s very fast, smooth, modern looking and updated with newest stuff."
