Dirt Rally. I hate that game. It's so good.
It's great for wire shelving units and accessories. We got the Container Store brand for shelves but the rest from this site.
"I use a Rx 580 for 1080p 144hz.  It's fine for most games.  Just lower settings to high for most games or medium for brand new AAA games.

Although pretty much every monitor recommendation assumes max Ultra settings, it's much more reasonable to set graphics to high for higher framerates.  I don't know why the PC gaming crowd is so obsessed with Ultra settings."
">I'm a stickler for all the kids saying ""trick or treat!""

That sounds fair. :)

>I also shout Happy Halloween! when I open the door

That's a good tip! I wasn't planning on doing that."
YES to Charleston!!
"Whatever your degree is in is basically irrelevant if all you do is go to classes. Become bff with your profs. Befriend your department administrator. I have had some kick-ass part time jobs throughout undergrad and grad school because I made an effort to apply the stuff I learned in class, making my arts background stronger."
Grid 2.
"link plz, that sounds amazing"
My mind has been blown for the day.
"Recently just finished the audiobook for Hyperion and it was absolutely fantastic, can't wait for more."
I think Fincher had other projects he wanted to do more
"I live in Pennsylvania and it wasn’t really covered, most of the subject matter we covered from the 19th Century focuses on the Civil War, its causes, and then Reconstruction. 

it is possible if you live in Texas or other parts of the Southwest along the border the curriculum looks different and includes it more since its locally relevant there"
"I actually took a female friend with me for express purpose of trying scents *on me* for this reason. Subtle is the key. You don't want to over whelm  or offend someone with your scent. Less is more and I've recieved lots of compliments. We settled on [Paul Sebastian](https://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/413767/900.jpg). 

*Edit: mom's can also help*"
"Dear Hollywood *and* Literature,

Things could be worse. 

- Music"
That's less than the amount I'd be saving on meat. Woohoo!
"Why is legality the same as morality for you?

All genocides are moral and justified as long as they are not explicitly illegal (and perhaps, additionally, the body politic agrees with them)?

You have your causality backwards: laws are made to conform to morality, something is not moral just because it is legal."

"I have to because virgin media blocks the site, but I’m using a free mobile one and it works without issue"
"It's 2017, so yes?"
"Clean off the top of your vent hood!
p.s. yes the cabinets do look good."
"Neon chrome looks like a fantastic game, definitely putting that one on my list of games to play !"
Another vote for Mindhunter.
"The best thing I did was get the Fiske Guide to Colleges. It gives an unbiased overview of a bunch of college, and helps you get a sense of what things you’d like in a school (ex: Greek life, campus housing, male to female ration, undergrad size, etc)."
In the last I’ve stayed at the El Cortez and walking right out the door and to the gates was amazing. Last year there was a bit more of a walk but still very close. Room was decent. Price was worth the convenience ~$500 4 nights.
"the reputation of a California university on the east coast is an interesting topic, never really thought about it. The companies I've been at (northern and southern cal) don't seem to have a problem with hiring east coast graduates. If you need to know anything specifically about Fullerton, just shoot me a PM."
