Proper etiquette is to throw fist fulls of it as hard as you can in their faces.
Judging by your username you know your stuff! Cheers mate.

I really enjoyed The Adjustment Bureau and feel like it’s in that same realm
"Out of the games shown in the picture id have to say that the free portion of Inside was good, i wish i had the money to play the rest"
"Look into critical language scholarships or Russian flagship program. There's a need, and plenty of money being put toward addressing that need."
"Two scrambled eggs with parmesan cheese and peri peri, and a slice of homemade sourdough toast."
"PMD Explorers of sky give it a shot one of the best games I ever played,"
The Book of Lost Things is a great blow me away book. It's highly underrated and has a great message.
"You, sir, take the cake for making me laugh the hardest today."
"New mexican here...2nd this suggestion...we make breakfast burritos for Saturday/sunday brunch....shred potatoes with mandolin, fry in thin layer of oil, scramble eggs, bake thick-cut bacon, flour tortillas, cheese, green chile, layer and fold! Even the pickiest member of my family eats these!"

"Probably one of my favourite movies ever, I can honestly say i love it just as much, if not more than the book(and I am a slut for Gaiman)"

"What's great about Shashuka is how easy it is to make and also how easy it is to change stuff around too. I always make sure to add cheese to mine and occasionally meats too. Also, you have to be sure to have lots of flatbread when eating it."
I love you both

i’ve got an iPhone 11 and a 11 Pro Max. love them both
"I moved to an SE 2020 after my original SE was getting too unusable. I like it and it’s perfectly fine for everything I need. Battery life isn’t all that bad for me honestly. It seemed huge at first but still much smaller than the other iPhones at the time. Really hard to beat for the price and barley shows signs of wear in the year or so I’ve had it. 
If I were looking now I’d seriously look at the 12 mini though. Better screen and form factor and will be more future proof than the SE 2020 so should last even longer."
These look really unique! Might have to check them out.
"Disney definitely fits the bill, upstart another one. Palantir and snowflake maybe a little more speculative.

You still can’t deny the ones that have already run. Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon all have huge valuations but I’d still expect them to be in the biggest companies in the world 10 years from now.

Another I like on the long long hold is NVIDIA.

Full disclosure I own all these stocks but I’m not trying to pump it’s an honest opinion."
