I had a very positive experience, and I absolutely recommend the course. I was skeptical because it’s less recognized than General Assembly or some of the others. Also, there seems to be mixed perspectives as far as how valuable and worthwhile these courses are. You’ll see plenty of UX professionals on Reddit saying how they never hire people from these courses, etc. So naturally I was concerned, but took those statements with a grain of salt and pursued it anyways.

I think my experience was so positive because of my mentor. He was super communicative, encouraging, and empathetic, not to mention incredibly intelligent and successful. 

At the end of the course, I had completed an online portfolio and had gained the language to speak confidently about user experience design. Took me a couple months to land a job, but immediately landed a job after going through a staffing agency. 

Overall, completing the course through designlab truly set my life on the path I had wanted for so long. I’m now in an industry that challenges me, and every day I feel so fortunate to have had the fortitude to pursue what I wanted and to have actually landed a job. That being said, I am super passionate about understanding people on a very human level, problem solving, and working with others. I love giving people positive experiences, so the industry very much matches my personality. Definitely do your research before committing to one of these programs because once you commit, you really have to be prepared to work your ass off, even after the course ends. Interviews for these jobs are no joke. 

Can I ask, why do you wish to pursue one of these programs? What is driving you to want to enter this field?",best online college
