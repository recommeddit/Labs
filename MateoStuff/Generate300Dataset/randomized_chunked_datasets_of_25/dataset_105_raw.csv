Yes as it is all about money.
"Ahh interesting, thanks."
"I was thinking the same thing. It's not just that they mentioned it, it's the fact that it was the first thing on the list of amenities.  How about the comfortable bed where you will be having great honeymoon sex, or jacuzzis in the room, or a nice shower...then 10 items down the list mention the wifi."
GoW is an rpg as much as witcher 3 is lol
Ya I hear 4 Non Blondes did a pretty decent cover of that one.
"I bought a memory foam pillow for $20 about 2 years ago. It still has its spring and was stolen to my girlfriends side of the bed. 

Im gonna go buy another soon."
"The main difference is the refresh rate (hz). Many gaming monitors have 120hz or 144hz which means that every second, the screen refreshes 120 or 144 times. This will make games smoother."
You know you can just add booze to any soft drink for anywhere right? I usually add it to a Big Gulp from 711.
"""Now that I have all my furnishings in order, lemme just move everything I moved into my house back out of my house so we can paint it, and move everything back again!!"""
"Thanks, but I don't think I like five films of a single actor enough to list them. Bollywood movies these days are beyound my comprehension. I would rather watch the villian explaining all his plans to a tied hero and leave him to die near a time bomb than a frail guy kicking 20 guys, each thrice his size, allover like a football. This and all that CGI stuff don't seem real to me. The film should just flow infront of you..

Still there are some bollywood movies that I can watch again and again. Here are some of them-

Guide, Jewel Thief, Sholay, Don (1978), Pyasa, Parineeta (1953), Garam Hawa, Agneepath (1990), Namak Haram, Chupke Chupke, Sanghrash (1968), Angoor, Khakee, Shakti, New Delhi Times, Pratiggya..

There will be more but only these are coming to mind right now."
"I wish I had gold to give you for putting up all these links, but I don't, so all I can do is tell you that you are loved.  Thank you."
I use linux Mint as my main OS....I trail run other distros but Linux Mint is the most solid of all distros i have tried since I started using linux in 2002
"Hi, I'll be moving to the USA in early January next year (I'll be buying the laptop around then) and I'm looking for a laptop around $1300. I've been thinking about the legion 5 pro but have heard bad things about its build quality and battery life is there anything with similar specs which is objectively better?"
"Sadly, yup. I kept telling people on this sub and on r/movies that they do not understand just how much the general audience loved Black Panther. My wife has no love for comic stuff like me and she went to see that movie 3 times. My mom, who probably never saw a superhero movie in her life, went to go see it twice. 

It’s a flawed movie, maybe not the best MCU flick by our standards, but the average person off the street loves it tremendously. I don’t even fully understand why it resonated so well with people from all races and countries, but it’s quite miraculous."
YNAB isn't free but well worth the subscription fee.
"Yep, 'awesome' as in Yosemite/universe/hurricanes."
I just make my checked bag look like the biggest piece of shit around. Like it's been through a natural disaster and is held together with duct tape. If some asshole is looking for valuables to steal they won't reach for mine over a designer bag.
It's hard to imagine he could've done much worse than Johnson.
He passed the cool to you through the high-five. Awesome.
If she is a person who would like that. I find the whole spa environment more awkward than relaxing but damn getting my hair and nails done would be amazing.
I forgot GTA V was released on the 360 too. It has lasted longer than the Xbox One at this point.
Not really quite the same without Bradman though.
"Witcher 3
Horizon 
Persona 5
Nier: Automata 
Transistor

I see some people say Horizon isn't an RPG.

Cases for:

Well you level up
Every upgrade you can craft and unlock most of before you manage 50% through the story.

Game is very open ended, if you can knock level 20 characters at 10, good for you.  It's a bit easy to cheese some enemies.

Includes magic: in the form of 
Ice, shock, fire, corruptions on arrows. It's not directly ""magic"" but you get my point. 

Has a few ""dungeons"" in the form of cauldrons but this my weakest point. 


Multiple weapons but they are mostly projectile 

Very similar to Witcher. You use a bow instead of sword.  Shorter too. The map is condensed beautifully."
"This is my exact situation. I literally drive past Lowe’s on my way to Home Depot. Every now and again I just stop at Lowe’s for convenience, but I almost always regret the decision, and half the time wind up at Home Depot eventually anyways."
"Never, because they taste DISGUSTING.

Except once in a rare while I'll have that Rockstar shit that's energy drink plus 7% alcohol or whatever. Man. If you ever want to seem like a crackhead, that's amazing shit."
