Do you know why Baskin Robbins only has 31 flavors? Because Chuck Norris doesn't like Fudge Ripple.

"\> PWM flicker

Which doesn't affect everyone.

\> black smearing

Yup, 100% an issue.

\> poor low brightness colour accuracy (especially greys)

Yup.

\> muddy-looking bright colours

Absolutely no idea what you're talking about

\> image retention and burn-in

Honest question: have there been many cases of image retention or burn-in on the X/Xs/11 Pro? I'd imagine Reddit of all places would be swamped with complaints, but I can't remember seeing any complaints and I, personally, haven't seen these issues."

"Wes Bos's React For Beginners. However, I suggest you don't try to take the entire course in a single bite, you won't internalize the concepts and end up forgetting everything.  Pay full attention in each of the videos,  and if you feel overwhelmed and lost, that's a good sign you didn't grasp the concepts, so watch the video from the beginning all over again.

I would have been great if Wes had included third party API fetching.

Also, start making a list of MINI projects, REALLY SIMPLE and basic projects, even if they have no meaning, don't yet think of a shopping site, or a complex fitness webapp, because as long as you don't know the core react concepts you will spend hours trying to figure out how each component should work, receive or send data.

After taking that course, you could also follow other simple youtube tutorials that make basic apps, each one with different functionalities."
