"I sorted by controversial and I can't say I'm surprised to see this as the top comment.

It's my favorite too. Stay strong, brother. There are dozens of us out there."
"I have a friend who is 92 who only now stopped driving and another friend at age 89 still plays golf twice a week.  Your mom has lots of good years ahead of her. (Fingers crossed for us all!)

(A neurologist just told the 92 year old to take 1000 IU of vitamin E twice daily so I’m signing up for that!)"
"It is worth noting that bottled water is colossally expensive compared to tap water. A $2 bottle of water costs the manufacturer about $0.05 to make.  A 4000% markup. Not to mention the plastic waste it makes.

If you have bad pipes you can buy a filter for home for your drinking water from the tap."
Muh lakes!
You sweet thang!
"Martin Perfecto de Cos was probably - in my humble opinion, at least - Santa Ana’s best general, and his writings about Santa Ana are - also in my opinion - the most credible.  He was a very practical and very capable general. 

He often offered some very sensible precautions in their military campaign - but Santa Ana usually just blew him off, because he thought his own judgment was more or less infallible. 

Mexico would have been *far* better off if de Cos had been in charge of the Mexican Army back then.  Santa Ana was bold and took a lot of chances most generals wouldn’t have. 

It’s just that you don’t really *need* to be incautious and daring against a bunch of poorly-armed, poorly-trained rebels.  De Cos would have rolled right into Texas and quickly flattened the rebellion with no muss and no fuss - just like he did the *first* time Mexico City sent troops there.  Sometimes, taking a simple tactical approach to some situations is best. 

But Santa Ana wanted the “tough guy” image, and just got overly-confident in his own approach. 

And it cost Mexico a huge chunk of its northern boundaries."
Wasn't aware Walmart had their own brand of filters for Pur products.
"I used to be a programmer for a large Healthcare Software company, and I can tell you it's one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. The hours aren't bad, the pay definitely wasn't bad for someone coming straight out of college, and the benefits were the best I've ever seen (pretty much every medical procedure was 100% covered), and the campus was like a playground. Not kidding, I took a slide to my office every morning and there were indoor bags sets and pool tables we could play with during the day.

The only reason I left was because I got engaged and needed to move back home :(

Oh yeah, and saving people and stuff is good too. If you have the drive to help people medically but you can't deal with the blood and the needles and stuff this is the job for you.

Edit: I got a lot of questions, so here are the goddamn answers.

Yes. I worked at Epic in Wisconsin.

I actually majored in Industrial Engineering in college, programming was more of a hobby of mine but I applied to Epic on a whim (one of those ""Why not?"" things). During the hiring process they don't focus on your knowledge of programming, rather they test your logic skills and analyze how you think about things, the philosophy being that if they find someone who can think the right way the programming language can be taught later.

Epic is always looking for new developers, the healthcare industry is really stable and growing (everyone needs healthcare) so Epic is constantly hiring new people. As long as you fit their criteria (see above: testing testing testing) it's pretty easy to get in.

Epic has lots of different teams, for example they have ASAP which is their ER application, Beaker which is their lab app, etc. Your work load largely depends on what application you are placed under. I was placed in Tapestry, which is the application for insurance claims and other insurance related stuff. While it wasn't as interesting as other applications the work load was very manageable. I can't say I ever worked more than 45 hours a week and normally just 40.

Epic's dress code is something to the effect of ""when customers are around wear clothes."" So basically literally wear whatever you want that's appropriate. I usually wore jeans and a hoodie. They also have very flexible hours. I usually worked from 10-6 but I had friends who would do 6-2. No one really keeps track of when you come and leave, just as long as you get your work done.

I would definitely recommend this job. Laid back environment and a very rewarding career."
thanks but i don't think i can lift that alone. need something i can lift solo
I live 600 miles from home these days and only get to see my folks about once every few months.  My dad's response is just to have me home.
"Got it, thanks so much for the reply!  Really appreciate the advice"
I hate 1 million but I just bought L'Homme last month and I love it so much. Wearing it right now.
Thanks for the suggestion my fiancee has been glued to the app for the last hour!!!
My bad.  I initially disregarded it because it says download progress and I needed upload progress.  And are you bringing in a dependency to do that?  It looks like it....
Lava Lamp.
Every now-and-then I go to IHOP and treat myself to stuffed French toast with an extra egg and bacon.  It's a God damn dream.
