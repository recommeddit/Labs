27642,best bollywood actor,Hrithik is every straight guy's choice üòÇ he's like the most obvious good looking one out of all the actors
31070,best country to live in,Fails on gender equality. Scandinavia wins out
40003,best Chrome extensions,Great Infographic ! Anyone wouldn't have something similar for Firefox ?
4275,best text editor,"I remember that TextEdit (I think that's what it's called, shareware editor with a large blue T for a logo) could handle huge files (GB-sized) with surprising ease, it would just open up like the file was a few KB long. I was impressed by that, and couldn't find another program that does that. Otherwise, it was not that special, so I don't use it any more."
34443,best NFL player,Salary cap decreases parity by a large margin... the whole reason the salary cap became a thing because there was only 4 teams dominating the game. Please don't try and say the non salary cap era is harder than the salary cap era lmao.
53114,best hiphop album,Damn there‚Äôs something so captivating about his delivery. It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs trying to sound bad on purpose but he‚Äôs so damn confident. I‚Äôm loving this album. It‚Äôs like mixing E-40 with Dr. Seuss for real lol. Detroit has a unique rap scene for sure.

10694,best suitcase lock,Buy bags that come with double zippers.. they can‚Äôt be open end up with sharp objects
30914,best country to live in,I moved to Australia four years ago. There isn't much to complain about. Its far away from everything so travelling overseas is expensive.
4236,best text editor,"One thing not too many people have addressed is the LANGUAGE you are going to be working in.

Some editors just have amazing built-in support for some languages that makes it worth using that one editor for that one job."
25366,best spiderman actor,"MJ never acts like comics MJ and if you believe that then you're pretty wrong. Mary Jane's Character actually is written well and just lacks little things like the extrovert persona that would make her the perfect MJ, she's still pretty close to the real MJ.

Michelle is barely a character and their romance was set up bad if you think their set up is good then you're objectively wrong because it happened off screen and was never even hinted at.

Just because Gwen does things doesn't mean that she's the better written love Interest. If you compare the writing to Tobey's and Kirsten's Relationship you actually see the development and it feels natural. The reveal was also written way better and more satisfying than the TASM movie.

The Fight with Doc Ock is definitely way better than TASM but the swinging in TASM 2 was the best ever in any movie."
22091,best celebrity,"Ed O'Neill. Al Bundy himself. They were filming the Modern Family Disneyland episode. He was in one of the stores looking for a gift or something and I was looking for a expensive sweater. He came up next to me and I asked how it felt throwing 4 TDs in a game. He said, ""Fantastic."" Chatted with me for like 10 minutes. Been watching Modern Family since..."
2742,best headphones,"A year later and it's all still the same... Disappointing

53282,best usb c charging cable,"You ever tried Nekteck cables? Can get nice certified USB-C ones(3.1 gen 2, 100W) for $10, 2-pack for $15 [here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718Z1MWF/?coliid=I2D0KL4G2ZG3FH&colid=RID0PITFNKKM&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it).
Alternatively, ever tried Monoprice cables? Not USB-IF certified, but well-known for decent quality. Something like [this on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Select-CERTIFIED-Nintendo-Samsung/dp/B073W1KS4P/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=monoprice+usb+c&qid=1626429131&sr=8-5), USB 3.1 gen 2, 100W, not certified though(but probably spec-compliant based on their past cables).
Otherwise, wanna try [Cable Matters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756QGTVQ/?coliid=I31KXWCRTK62VM&colid=2FD0LIILOG0HB&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)? It's $11 on Amazon for 100W charging, USB 2.0, or you can get their USB 3.1 100W for [$14](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-USB-IF-Certified-Delivery/dp/B01L0F6AJI/ref=mp_s_a_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=cable+matters+usb+c&qid=1626429016&sr=8-14). Both USB-IF certified too, and a well-known brand.
One more recommendation is AmazonBasics, like another redditor suggested. They got a wide range of USB C cables, all USB IF certified, and tested by a Google engineer(Benson Leung, he's here on this sub too) to be spec-compliant and good-quality(not to mention cheap. If you only need 60W and below charging, try [this USB 2.0 cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-C-Micro-B-USB-IF-Certified/dp/B085S9XPZ9/ref=mp_s_a_1_19?dchild=1&keywords=amazonbasics+usb+c&qid=1626429354&sr=8-19)($5), or [this USB 3.1 gen 2 cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-C-3-1-Gen2-Cable/dp/B085S9XSVL/ref=mp_s_a_1_27?dchild=1&keywords=amazonbasics+usb+c&qid=1626429354&sr=8-27)($9)"

Looking to expand my knowledge and practical understanding of stats as a relative beginner to stats, and a complete beginner to applied stats. My previous experience with the topic include 3 business stats courses taken in undergrad."
