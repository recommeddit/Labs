4275,"I remember that TextEdit (I think that's what it's called, shareware editor with a large blue T for a logo) could handle huge files (GB-sized) with surprising ease, it would just open up like the file was a few KB long. I was impressed by that, and couldn't find another program that does that. Otherwise, it was not that special, so I don't use it any more.",best text editor

25366,"MJ never acts like comics MJ and if you believe that then you're pretty wrong. Mary Jane's Character actually is written well and just lacks little things like the extrovert persona that would make her the perfect MJ, she's still pretty close to the real MJ.

Michelle is barely a character and their romance was set up bad if you think their set up is good then you're objectively wrong because it happened off screen and was never even hinted at.

Just because Gwen does things doesn't mean that she's the better written love Interest. If you compare the writing to Tobey's and Kirsten's Relationship you actually see the development and it feels natural. The reveal was also written way better and more satisfying than the TASM movie.

The Fight with Doc Ock is definitely way better than TASM but the swinging in TASM 2 was the best ever in any movie.",best spiderman actor

53282,"You ever tried Nekteck cables? Can get nice certified USB-C ones(3.1 gen 2, 100W) for $10, 2-pack for $15 [here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718Z1MWF/?coliid=I2D0KL4G2ZG3FH&colid=RID0PITFNKKM&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it).
Alternatively, ever tried Monoprice cables? Not USB-IF certified, but well-known for decent quality. Something like [this on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Select-CERTIFIED-Nintendo-Samsung/dp/B073W1KS4P/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=monoprice+usb+c&qid=1626429131&sr=8-5), USB 3.1 gen 2, 100W, not certified though(but probably spec-compliant based on their past cables).
Otherwise, wanna try [Cable Matters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756QGTVQ/?coliid=I31KXWCRTK62VM&colid=2FD0LIILOG0HB&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)? It's $11 on Amazon for 100W charging, USB 2.0, or you can get their USB 3.1 100W for [$14](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-USB-IF-Certified-Delivery/dp/B01L0F6AJI/ref=mp_s_a_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=cable+matters+usb+c&qid=1626429016&sr=8-14). Both USB-IF certified too, and a well-known brand.
One more recommendation is AmazonBasics, like another redditor suggested. They got a wide range of USB C cables, all USB IF certified, and tested by a Google engineer(Benson Leung, he's here on this sub too) to be spec-compliant and good-quality(not to mention cheap. If you only need 60W and below charging, try [this USB 2.0 cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-C-Micro-B-USB-IF-Certified/dp/B085S9XPZ9/ref=mp_s_a_1_19?dchild=1&keywords=amazonbasics+usb+c&qid=1626429354&sr=8-19)($5), or [this USB 3.1 gen 2 cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-C-3-1-Gen2-Cable/dp/B085S9XSVL/ref=mp_s_a_1_27?dchild=1&keywords=amazonbasics+usb+c&qid=1626429354&sr=8-27)($9)",best usb c charging cable
