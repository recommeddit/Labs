"I feel like I'm recommending Sylvia Day's Seven Years to Sin like every day on here! haha. One of my favorite historicals along with Lisa Kleypas' Again the Magic. And I like everything Sarah MacLean writes.  

For fantasy, I love love love Karen Marie Moning's Fever Series and I'm constantly recommending it as well as anything by Laura Thalassa whose male leads are just so evil and amazing. And of course ACOTAR (surprised to not see it mentioned).  

And for contemporary, I love TL Swan's The Stopover and Kresley Cole's Gamemaker series."
"I’ve been having a lot of fun with games that have controller support, Minecraft, Dead Cells, Fortnite

It helps that the two of those multiplayer options are cross platform too, I played fortnite with my buddies who were on PS4 and it worked great.

CoD mobile is fun, it’s a solid arcade shooter experience I’d expect from the title, without the 200 something gb, it’s great to be able to chill on the couch and jump in for a quick round of multiplayer, zombies or br. Idc if it’s bots or players, I’m super casual and it’s just fun to shoot stuff.

I haven’t seen much about them on IOS but I played a lot of Kotor and Baldurs Gate II back n the day and I may pick them up soon, I think they’d be worth it if they’re solid ports and you’re into rpgs.

I’m also considering picking up GTA SA for the mindless fun factor, had lots of fun with that growing up and I could see it being really fun."
"These are certainly a broad spectrum of sf, but surely not the best we can do to really show off the greats (and perhaps unsung greats) of the genre. Here's my list:

1. **The Jerusalem Quartet**, Edward Whittimore: you've never read these. You've probably never heard of them. This is a grievous oversight and due to the fact that Whittimore was never a commercial success. They're utterly brilliant, with shades of Pynchon and Vonnegut.

2. **Snow Crash**, Neil Stephenson: the quintessential 90s cyberpunk novel. What Stephenson lacks in Gibson's prose ability, he more than makes up in capturing the *style* of the post-technical age, and presents a dystopia that is alarmingly possible.

3. **The Left Hand of Darkness**, Ursula K. LeGuin: sf's Grandmistress in high form. Thought-provoking and original.

4. **Perdido Street Station**, China Mieville: one of sf's young guns and a pioneer of the New Weird, Mieville's romp through a truly alien world stumbles over its own cleverness at times, but still, a fine look at new talent.

5. **A Canticle of Leibowitz**, Walter M. Miller: possibly the greatest post-apocalyptic novel ever written, if only for its sheer scope, hope, and hopelessness.

6. **Use of Weapons**, Iain M. Banks: a challenging read, but probably the best of Banks's ""Culture"" novels. Almost certainly one of the more accessible ones, even considering the author's desire to play with narrative structure.

7. **Southern Reach Trilogy**, Jeff Van Der Meer: hallucinatory, dreamlike, and utterly alien. Weird, but weird in a very special way. Not for fans of unconventional narratives that raise more questions than they answer, but just right for people seeking experiences unlike anything they've known before.

8. **Stand on Zanzibar**, John Brunner: presciently envisages our world, even though it misses the details. Adopts Dos Passos's unique narrative structure to create a truly postmodern novel that is unafraid to embrace new media as a storytelling device.

9. **A Fire Upon the Deep**, Vernor Vinge: you wanted space opera? How about space opera written by someone with some serious prose chops?

10. **Night's Dawn**, Peter F. Hamilton: another space opera that manages to remember that plot serves characters, and not vice-versa (looking at you, Herbert).

11. **The Dying Earth**, Jack Vance: if you haven't read Vance's set of loosely-linked stories about a far-future Earth which has seen ages come and come round again, you've not truly lived.

12. **Viriconium**, M. John Harrison: while we're on the subject, M. John Harrison may have out-Vanced Vance at the dying Earth genre.

13. **The Expanse**, James S.A. Corey (really Dan Abraham and Ty Franck): forgive the fourth book in the series. They can't all be winners. Book Five more than makes up for it. You're only on book one? I guess you should read faster.

14. **The Yiddish Policemen's Union**, Michael Chabon: I fussed over whether to include this one or **Gentlemen of the Road**, and settled with **TYPU**, for its use of pastiche and Chabon's signature dry wit. 

15. **The Solar Cycle**, Gene Wolfe: only because I felt putting ""Gene Wolfe's collected body of work, multiple times"" would be gauche, and honestly, there are low points. While **The Fifth Head of Cerberus** is arguably some of the finest prose ever put on paper, the **Book of the New Sun** and its loosely (very loosely) linked sister series the **Book of the Long Sun** and **Book of the Short Sun** comprise something that blends literary and genre, fantasy and science, rationality and faith, and a damn good story together with some of the most original and thought-provoking wordcraft ever. Not for the faint of heart or those who only want an easy diversionary read, a good Wolfe book can command your life for weeks after you finish the last page.

**HONORABLE MENTIONS**: Madam Atwood's *Oryx and Crake* novels deserve mention, if only because their inclusion on this list would cause her to frown. And I suppose it is only politic to mention *Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World*, by Haruki Murakami, though I do think it of lesser quality than any of the other books mentioned here. You'll be popular at parties if you say you read Murakami, though, so knock yourselves out."
">  At first you won't think it's doing its job, as it's really gentle on the teeth.

For me, it kind of hurt the first couple of days I used it.  It was bearable, though, and after 2 days I got completely used to it and the pain went away."

"IANAS, so I will gladly lurk in your subreddit (unless I happen upon a particularly interesting paper).  Cheers.

*Edit*: Question: If I do happen upon a paper I would like to share, is there any limitation I should keep in mind in terms of age? In other words, hypothetically, would it be appropriate to post a paper that is, let's say, a few years old?"

"I'm shameless. ;)

I didn't list any junior colleges. There are 112 of them, but currently there are [only three reddits for junior colleges in California](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/california#Juniorcolleges). There is [/r/CaliforniaCommunityColleges](/r/calcommunitycolleges) for issues related to all California Community Colleges.

On the other hand, there is nothing from stopping you from creating one. Would you be interested in being a mod for a reddit for City College of San Francisco?"
