52194,best hiphop album,"I'd recommend checking producers you enjoy the sonics of. there's dudes like Prince Paul who produced the first 3 De La Soul albums which are all amazing.

And then the Gravediggaz album he produced is one of the earliest examples of horrorcore, has RZA on it.

And then the Handsome Boy Modelling School album 'So How's Your Girl' with Dan the Automator and a slew of dope rappers. Its one of the most diverse hip hop albums you'll hear with mind blowing tunes on it.

Some other random shit. Since people say Doom but don't know it as well. check the album before he became the villain. KMD's Black Bastards - its amazing.

Check El-P's I'll Sleep When You're Dead.

Check Jurassic 5 - Quality Control (or any album besides their last)

Check Dizzee Rascals Boy In Da Corna - timeless classic, so banging.

Fuck listening to just American hip hop, ya a stooge if you take that path.

Check Jehst Return of the Drifter.

Check Betty Ford Boys

Check Pete Rock and CL Smooth - Mecca and the Soul Brother

Check Hilltop Hoods - The Hard Road

Check DJ Shadow - Endtroducing

13264,best gifts for mom,"An experience. Ask them if there's something they've always wanted to do but never had the opportunity. Then figure out how to make it happen.

I did this for my father's 70th birthday. He always wanted to fly a plane, so I surprised him with 1 hour flying lesson. He LOVED it.


You'll be a hero. If it's expensive try to make it a group gift by including other family members. They will also thank you. Good luck!"

54349,best medicine for a cold,"Zinc rapid melt tablets. 

Not the ones that you swallow, but the ones that you let melt and coat your mouth and throat.

I doubt any cold could be cured overnight, but my roommate, a major skeptic of the idea, had to admit that it seemed to help. Supposedly the zinc disrupts the replication of the cold virus where it is most concentrated, allowing your immune system to clear the infection faster."

68413,best science fiction novel,"So, another thing on BotNS:   By not finishing it you're not just missing what happens in the remaining books, but also stuff from the books you've already read that don't really get proper context until the later books.  It's for that reason that many have said that the series is more enjoyable on a re-read since then you're more in the know as to what's going on around Severian from the get-go and can even [minor spoiler](#s ""spot a some places where Severian fudges his own narrative to make himself look better to the reader"").  

Also, the next series in the cycle, Book of the Long Sun, is much more enjoyable to read from a plot perspective and the last, Book of the Short Sun, is where shit gets even more weird and eventually completes the full Solar Cycle."
