52194,"I'd recommend checking producers you enjoy the sonics of. there's dudes like Prince Paul who produced the first 3 De La Soul albums which are all amazing.

And then the Gravediggaz album he produced is one of the earliest examples of horrorcore, has RZA on it.

And then the Handsome Boy Modelling School album 'So How's Your Girl' with Dan the Automator and a slew of dope rappers. Its one of the most diverse hip hop albums you'll hear with mind blowing tunes on it.

Some other random shit. Since people say Doom but don't know it as well. check the album before he became the villain. KMD's Black Bastards - its amazing.

Check El-P's I'll Sleep When You're Dead.

Check Jurassic 5 - Quality Control (or any album besides their last)

Check Dizzee Rascals Boy In Da Corna - timeless classic, so banging.

Fuck listening to just American hip hop, ya a stooge if you take that path.

Check Jehst Return of the Drifter.

Check Betty Ford Boys

Check Pete Rock and CL Smooth - Mecca and the Soul Brother

Check Hilltop Hoods - The Hard Road

Check DJ Shadow - Endtroducing

It's for that reason that many have said that the series is more enjoyable on a re-read since then you're more in the know as to what's going on around Severian from the get-go and can even [minor spoiler](#s ""spot a some places where Severian fudges his own narrative to make himself look better to the reader"").
