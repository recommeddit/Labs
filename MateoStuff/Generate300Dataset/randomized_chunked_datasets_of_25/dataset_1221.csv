47506,"I did a bus tour once of the Grand Canyon and some of Utah‚Äôs parks (along with a few other places). That was pretty cool. My all-time favorite though was actually a cross country train trip. I‚Äôm in college so I‚Äôm pretty broke, but I really wanted to go camping in Glacier National Park. What ended up happening is that I took the train from DC to Glacier and camped for a few days before coming back. I took everything for 10+ days of travel and camping in a backpack. I got to see some amazing scenery and visit places I never would‚Äôve been to otherwise. We went through Chicago, the Twin Cities, and North Dakota, and we crossed the Mississippi. It was a little bit of a crazy thing to do but it was a great experience",best state to visit in the United States

I haven't gone over the references in any detail yet, but one link that still seems to be missing is the connection between that research and the actual product.  Again, a study of the product by an independent lab would provide that link.  Some feedback for your boss' boss.. :)",best water filter

Not only do you have two of the stones, there are a lot of call backs related to Tony‚Äôs (character) arc, Sokovia, Hulk, etc. Not to mention the excellent payoff for Hawkeye‚Äôs farm that comes in the opening of Endgame. It‚Äôs messy but unskippable in my humble opinion.",best Marvel movie

I'm also very interested in [the Otter+Pop cases](https://i.imgur.com/Mjhg48i.jpg) though. Super sturdy and I've had a popsocket for over 3 years, wouldn't want to go without now...

26762,"I agree with others that the only ""must have"" games are which you have played which you have personally decided you must have.

But here are some games I have which almost everyone enjoys (and which many people on reddit also recommend, so it's not just my friends), which aren't on your buy list, so you might try playing them and decide if you must have them:

**Bohnanza** is a simple card game of trading and selling beans. The game gives you strong motivation to trade -- sometimes you're willing to trade something away for free just to get rid of it -- so it's more interactive and friendly than **Catan**. It's small, cheap, 2-7 people can play, and even your grandparents will enjoy it.

**Power Grid** is an auction and network building game with a high ratio of depth to rules. It's fairly easy to learn and very strategic. Although I've never heard anyone dispute that it's a well-designed game, the mental arithmetic it requires isn't fun for everyone, so try before you buy.

**Jaipur** is a card game of trading and selling for two people. It's simple but still presents you with difficult decisions. Highly recommended for couples, since it's not too confrontational but still competitive.

**Pandemic** is *the* classic cooperative game of racing to cure diseases and prevent outbreaks. It's great to discover the strategy with a group of friends over several plays. After a while if you decide you've mastered it, there are expansions to increase the challenge or let you play the evil mastermind against your inexperienced friends.

**Acquire** is a classic stock buying game. It's elegant and balanced, and  it feels like a euro from the 90s as opposed to an american game from the 60s (which it is). If you get into this genre you'll probably find other more complex games you like more, but this is one that's easy to learn and still enjoyable after years of playing.

**The Resistance** is a party game of accusation and lying. The rules are incredibly minimal and provide just enough framework to build arguments around. You'll be surprised to learn which of your friends are good liars. Frankly there's not a whole lot of strategy to the game and you might get tired of it after a while but it's still (I think) the game with the highest ratio of fun to simplicity in the genre.

**Coup** is a light bluffing game for 2-6. Despite the core mechanic of lying, there is a surprising amount of strategy. It's great to fill those gaps of time while waiting for people to arrive or between longer games.",best board games
