11213,"My vote is for a Timbuk2 laptop backpack. I have a Timbuk2 Hemlock (a roll-top bag) that I got my freshman year of college. The Hemlock has a 15"" padded laptop pocket. I wouldn't particularly recommend the roll-top design for just classes, but I use it as my beach bag and an overnight duffel at times.Back to the point, Timbuk2 has lifetime guarantees on all their gear. Their stuff is truly top-notch. Tough materials with serious stitching and practical design with tons of interior room. They seem to like to give you open space instead of a billion pockets that restrict where you can put stuff in your bag. A lot of their bags also have a 'stash pocket' or whatever they call it on the back for your well...stash, if you're into that sort of thing. Personally, I keep a couple emergency bucks in mine. Simply put, though, the quality is incredible.If you're interested, DON'T buy from their site. If you do, you're looking at well over $100 a bag. I bought my bag at Sierra Trading Post for about $50 thanks to the 20% coupons that are almost always available for them. They're sometimes previous-year styles, but hell, I've heard of people who are still using their 20 year old Timbuk2 bags so I figure one year should make no difference.",best backpack for college
