"Disaronno and Dr. Pepper.  So smooth, you don't realize you're buzzed until it's too late."
"Yeah, you’re right in retrospect. Also just looked up WG and his Test record isn’t actually as impressive as I thought. Still, beats Compton on the beard front."
Now you’re on the trolley!
"You went to India??!! How was it?

How was the hospitality and food good? How did the food there differ from Indian food in the USA?

Are you Indian? Do you have family there?"
I like how they make the classic sound come off as fresh again with modern techniques here and there.
I get headaches with oled
"Been watching old Windies highlights

Man what I wouldn't pay to watch Viv Richards in IPL. He would be an absolute beast. AB tier"
"Aaron Rodgers, Aaron Donald, Davante Adam's, Patrick Mahomes, Derrick Henry, Travis Kelce, TJ Watt, Quentin Nelson. Who am I missing"
"Bleu De Chanel EDP

"> you should have been saving 

In this economy?"
"The only issue is debt. I studied English, graduated with $0 in debt and $5000 in savings (my tuition was $120/year).

The only thing wrong with Liberal Arts is debt. If they can make college cheaper, we'd have a surge in the humanities again."
Long island iced tea for sure
No one else is gonna say it? JUMANJI
Dr. Pepper and rum
"Time.   

I want us to sit around playing games (board games or video games- it doesn't matter which) and eat too much food and reminisce and laugh.  Laugh until our sides hurt.  I just want you to spend time with me.  Greatest gift ever.

But if you insist that I have something to unwrap then make me something.  I saved all your best artwork from grade school.  I keep my keys in that clay bowl you made and the small clay chicken that I thought was a dinosaur... well, I turned that one into a magnet for the fridge you know :)  I miss getting those things.   Make me another craft or ornament for the tree.  Draw me a picture that I can hang on the fridge or in my office or use as a bookmark even.  Make me a key ring so I'll think of you every time I reach for them.  I don't care if you're not super artistic.   I don't care if the item doesn't look like it belongs in fancy a catalog or an art gallery.

Don't bother spending money to buy me a key ring or an ornament- unless it's super special and has meaning - if it's linked to a a memory that's okay.   Because gift giving isn't about spending money.  It's about saying I remember you and I love you."
Ant-Man and the Wasp. The post-credits scene >!that linked to The Decimation that occurred at the end of Avengers: Infinity War!<.
"The Flaming homer? You mean, the Flaming Moe. And your dad didn't invent it you wuss. Moe the bartender did."
"Imagine, I can remember it (I grew up in England btw)"
3 was pretty revolutionary when it came out.  I’m sure that’s why
"This looks like a ""most popular"" list."
This is the real LPT here. I have had valuables taken twice by TSA that were not on any kind of restricted list.  They will steal your shit.
What shortcuts?
"As someone who previously lived in NC - it's a great state.  Left for job reasons.  Love going back to visit - lots of cool hip cities like Durham and Asheville with cool local breweries, or more urban places like Raleigh and Charlotte, which are both bigger cities but very different from one another in their own right.  And of course, most of the NC coast is gorgeous...hmm, maybe I need to move back."
"Thanks, I updated it.  I play it on my 3DS, so I got confused."
:p
