There are mechanical watches, digital watches and so on. The watches are very affordable and of good quality. Is a very cost-effective watch brand. All watches have 3ATM waterproof daily life, which means it can withstand the occasional splash of water or the rain, but refrain from wering it when showering or if you plan on swimming. The design is simple and classic, and the appearance is stylish and versatile. Very suitable for wearing in daily life.
