"The one at the end of Robot & Frank. I had no idea what to expect from that film, I only watched it because I saw it on Netflix, liked the title and laughed at the synopsis, but it has quickly become one of my very favourite movies."
[Dark reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US) it changes all web sites to have a dark color palette. It is amazingly useful for browsing websites that don’t have a dark theme at night.
Yeah I did that. I tried to spoof CurrentBatteryCapacity and it didn’t work. Resprung and everything.
"[This is my current monitor. ASUS VS229H-P. 1080p 60hz eIPS](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005S0XYKK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). For the size and price, absolutely no complaints. Haven't even found a single dead pixel."
I’ve been bumping $uicideboy$ a bunch lately
"It'll be almost impossible to find a chest freezer that will last you for life at this time.  Almost all consumer chest freezers from the major manufacturers (Frigidaire and GE are the big names in the game right now) are made at the same factory in China.  You can expect about 10 years of service from them on the high side, 5 on the low.

It sucks, but unless you look commercial, you'll have a tough time finding anything consumer line that will fit the bill.

I expect him to win comfortably.
MM is still superior. I'll die on that hill. Second best coaster line up in the states.
"The one you get from mixing Strawberry & Vanilla, I personally like to call it Valentine flavor xD"
"Live Oak, near Cottage Hospital, serves up very stylish and tasty food at very reasonable prices. Bettina, in Montecito, is great too, like a chic East Village pizza restaurant."

"Incipio Dual Pro, have used it for all my iPhones!"
">They might be low maintenance...

Cats are low maintenance? Am I doing  this wrong? Are my cats doing this wrong?"
"Wow, I didn't knew a lot of them, thanks for this list, I absolutely love to discover and try new Chrome extensions."
"Mattresses can range from the couple hundred dollars to 10k for the most part. And the higher cost doesnt mean better quality. 

I work in furniture repair and go out and do mattress inspections for warranty defects. The average price range would be somewhere around 3k. And that is pretty much middle of the road in the matt world. 

It's a hit and miss world. You would think Tempur-Pedic would be the end all be all of Matt's. It's a love it or absolutely hate it product. No middle ground and its 50/50 whether people like it long term or not. People fall in love with purple in the show room, drop 3k for one and then want it out of their house within a month. 

And I always get the well we spent 5k we thought we wouldn't have any problems and I am like cost doesnt matter its luck of the draw for the most part. You can get the same matt 10 times and 5 out of those 10 times it turns into a shitty matt the other 5 it works out and remains comfortable. 

Just use and remember your warranty."

"I feel that way about frost haven as well, at t he same time jaws is the perfect game for me. Frost haven is just to much, much like the original game. I am more so hoping to see either expansion content for jaws, or another product like it."

Which monitors do you have? I'm trying to narrow down my selection for my entry level monitor and am looking for 1080pish ips with freesync.
"Windies had Clive Lloyd for a chunk of the 80s, and Gordon Greenidge, both of whom are all time great bats for my money. Certainly if Mark Waugh or Justin Langer is considered a great, they easily meet that criteria. Desmond Haynes can't be far behind either of them too."
"The NZ economy is so very small.  It is less than one 10th the size of say the Australian economy.  Every year approximately 30,000 New Zealanders who were born in NZ leave NZ to try and have a better life in Australia.  Whenever I see NZ mentioned in these threads, I assume the person recommending it doesn’t really understand the very limited opportunities there.  People whose whole families live there and who have lived there their whole lives can’t see a prosperous future there."
"Ahaha you are right
It was more the way I have always felt in conservatory. Especially preparing exams. In the end, at high level, professionals all spend the same time practicing and studying."
"Thanks! Yeah, I thought about including Node.js. I'm glad you mentioned it. I chose RoR too for the same reason."
