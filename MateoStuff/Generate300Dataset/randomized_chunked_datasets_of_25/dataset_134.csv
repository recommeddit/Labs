61226,"Oh you're right, I thought they made it available for PS4 as well (it's on PS3, PS Vita and PSP). 

Well, to be more specific about this game, it has a really diverse story. You get to adventure in the most fantastic places, from small villages to big futuristic cities, mountains with dragons, universities, the deep ocean, the space, the moon, a floating castle, a pursuit on a train and so on... Couple that with time travel, politics, alien vibes when on the moon mission, sorcery, university students fighting as soldiers and the list goes on. There's also a romantic plot that's not too much nor too less, it stays right in a good spot. 

The opening of the game is some kind of art, no one can deny it's the best opening in any Final Fantasy game. The visual effects are a really nice upgrade from FF7, the summons are impressive, the difficulty is fair and the final boss is sooooo underrated. You're fighting a time travel sorceress with 4 different forms, whose power is to compress time itself, absorb it + space + existence, possess people and bring to life subconscious thoughts... Sephiroth what now? (yes you can kill a planet, but not a time travel goddess)

But like I said earlier, the gameplay mechanics may seem a bit off to some people. You have to absorb limited magic (from monster or in the outside world) and use them as a way to boost your character and summons stats. I don't think it's that bad personally, you can easily farm magic in the game and once you have enough of some magic, it doesn't really feel that limited (and it's easy to know when to use it).

There are so many good things about this game, but people will see one negative (read it different) and it's already the worst Final Fantasy.",Best RPG game on PS4

But I strongly feel he should have no issue handing this role to Tom Holland who I think is the perfect blend between Spider-Man and Peter Parker. 


While we are talking about it, does anyone else agree that the Vulture characters was easily Marvels best villian thus far. 

I would say even better than Loki because he is complex. We know he is the bad guy, but he isn't a bad person. He is just a blue collar guy trying to take care of his own. Even the one person he killed was a total accident.
