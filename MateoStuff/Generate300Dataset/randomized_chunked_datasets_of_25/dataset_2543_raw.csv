"Woow its Russian, that's interesting. I will add it to the list!"
"It doesn't. 

It changes how upset you'll be if it happens and fucks up your vacation. 

I'm just saying that if it's a once in a lifetime trip and you may never take another one like it then you should hold off and wait to go during the winter. 

But if you could afford a do over in 1-2 years then the risk is pretty low."
"I certainly don't, massive let down."
Is it not in Node because it’s marked as experimental on MDN?

"Depends on where in Australia, lots of jobs in Sydney and Melbourne but prices on everything are going up."
"I'll be honest, I drove a Model 3 Performance and all of the competition (Giulia Quadrifoglio, M3, ATS-V, and C63S), and the 3 to me is a better overall experience than the ATS-V and M3. The C63S sounds amazing, and the Giulia both sounds amazing and is super playful + nice looking, so I'd probably take one of those if they were similarly priced. 

However, at a $20k difference in MSRP after tax credits, the Model 3 Performance is an insane value. Handling is surprisingly solid, acceleration is like no other to 60, interior is pretty cool, and the autopilot is amazing. I've heard track mode makes the car even better, but I didn't get to drive with it on.

If I could get a couple year old one and had a place to charge, I'd already have a P3D, but unfortunately there are very few used and they still go for a lot of money so I'm currently leaning towards a rwd ICE car such as the C63S or Camaro SS 1LE(if I decide to go sports car with no space)."
"Wow, this was a really thorough and thoughtful post."
Fuck massages this one wants whisky!
"I got the pleasure of growing up there, I didn't realize how great it was until I left. My grandparents owned a place with a lot of land and a lake in the mountains, I miss it."
I’d veto the flowering crabapple. I have one and it loses its leaves in the summer every year. Something to do with a fungus I think? They’re pretty for like a week. And this year I missed out out on the flowers even because of a late snow we got.
Incendies has one of the most earth-shattering twists in film. What a knockout.

I’m surprised native union isn’t on here
"Sadly in Germany, it is making the rounds in the courts that dashcam footage is not permissible as evidence.  

On the contrary. You may have someone take you to court for filming them without their consent.  They are really going full retard about privacy for the individual when it comes down to dashcams. I have one and record regardless. In a dodgy situation, just mentioning in court that you actually have the incident on camera, even though it isn't admissible, may just tip the balance."
Rocksmith 2014 + a cheap guitar.
moog synth or a nord  synth... impressive how good nord's piano and organ emulation is.

"Some of the sites make you wade through a bunch of ads before you’re actually able to download the file… same as sites like zippyshare, etc. You just have to keep hitting the download button until it works, or use something that doesn’t display ads. 

I bought a premium account on mobilism (one-time charge of $20 I think) so I could get direct downloads instead of having to deal with all of the spam… but if you don’t want to do either, your best bet is to use IRC. You just search for the books you want, they send you a results file, and then you cut and paste your selection and then they send it to you direct.

[here’s how](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/2oftbu/guide_the_idiot_proof_guide_to_downloading_ebooks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) to use IRC for ebooks. It takes the most time to get set up (15 mins or so) but once you have it configured, it’s the fastest and most reliable way to get books. It only takes me around 45 seconds from opening IRC until I have the new book downloaded.

Oh, I use IRCHighway, not undernet. Pretty much nobody uses undernet anymore, But there are usually a few hundred people on irchighway at any given time plus around a dozen upload servers."
"Hard Cider. It’s not what I drink to get drunk, but it’s my favourite just to drink."
This sounded perfect to me until I got to the milk (I need wheat and dairy free breakfast).  Do you know if I can use an alternative to milk? Would water work?
