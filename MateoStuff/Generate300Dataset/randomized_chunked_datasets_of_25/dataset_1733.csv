My firm farmed me out contract and the company was so impressed with my work they hired me and and sent me on projects they were having issues on.

47519,"Someone already said it, but definitely Hilton Head Island. It's such a beautiful island and isn't too big, isn't too small. You can easily rent bikes as a way to get around. The beaches are great and clean.

I love Coligny Plaza the best, there are so many cute shops there and a couple of cool restaurants. Salty Dog in Sea Pines is a cool experience. On the other side of the island is the restaurant Hudson's which is great for a fancier meal. 

Harbour Town is a neat area. I'm pretty sure there is a dolphin cruise near there. Kayaking is a great recreational activity.

There is an outlet mall just off the highway before you get on the island that is always a must. 

I've gone there 10 times and it never gets old. There is always something new to do. This year is the first time I'm going since 2016 and I'm so excited, I've missed it.",best state to visit in the United States
