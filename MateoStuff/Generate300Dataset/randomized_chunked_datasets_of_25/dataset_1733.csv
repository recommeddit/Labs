43811,best items under $100,"Me too. I have a great psychiatrist who noticed I might benefit from a higher dosage of a stimulant (Adderall XR) and a lower dosage of my anxiety medicine (Lexapro) and after suffering through major depression and the causing lack of energy and interest in life, I truly have never felt better. I had been through so many medications that didn’t work for me and it was a relief to find something that didn’t make me feel like a zombie or jumpy and hyperactive."

31793,best hotel to live in,"I gross about 100k/yr.  I just sort of fell into this job.  I graduated with an engineering degree and had some construction experience.  While working at a firm, the work was slow and my boss knew someone at my current company that needed an inspector for a short project.  My firm farmed me out contract and the company was so impressed with my work they hired me and and sent me on projects they were having issues on.  At first I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but eventually when you're sent out to solve a problem, you just figure it out."

68226,best science fiction novel,"Yes, I have often thought that recommendations ONLY work when they are paired like ""if you like X you might like Y.""

47519,best state to visit in the United States,"Someone already said it, but definitely Hilton Head Island. It's such a beautiful island and isn't too big, isn't too small. You can easily rent bikes as a way to get around. The beaches are great and clean.

I love Coligny Plaza the best, there are so many cute shops there and a couple of cool restaurants. Salty Dog in Sea Pines is a cool experience. On the other side of the island is the restaurant Hudson's which is great for a fancier meal. 

Harbour Town is a neat area. I'm pretty sure there is a dolphin cruise near there. Kayaking is a great recreational activity.

There is an outlet mall just off the highway before you get on the island that is always a must. 

I've gone there 10 times and it never gets old. There is always something new to do. This year is the first time I'm going since 2016 and I'm so excited, I've missed it."

don't overexert yourself during the day and get to bed early. It works like a dream"
