22724,"Worked on a movie set. Zooey Deschanel is very aware that she's a big deal. Not downright mean, but remarkably entitled. 

Also, Alan Rickman...is totally a nice guy. Brought us tech guys donuts one day. 

EDIT: Since people are really curious about Rickman, I worked with him on Love Actually and later in a movie called The Promise, and the donuts he brought were a mix of glazed, chocolate twist, and rainbow sprinkle because he knew a guy's little girl was coming to work that day. Yes, Alan Rickman brought donuts for a little girl he didn't even know. Also, we got him to say that if we didn't admit who ate the last donut, ""we would all be found...e...qually guilty.""

 Definitely in my top 5 life moments.

Where I live now, the staff at Lowe's is way more helpful and competent (for the most part) paint department is way faster. Prices are better. Selection isn't (its an older smaller Lowe's) but then I just order online and have it shipped to store. In the 3 years I have been in my current house I have only had to go to HD maybe 5 times and it always annoys me.",best home improvement store
29840,"Sounds a lot like what my new bank Simple does. I was using Mint, but got fed up with the ads and feeling like it wasn't really helping me DO anything other than just keep an eye on my balances.

Simple let's you set up bills which it will move from your safe to spend bucket a month before they are due and the idea is that you set up all of your recurring bills there and what is left over is how much you are allowed to spend. It is the same enveloping strategy.

Simple has the advantage that they are your bank. So there is no security problem with linking to your checking account. I haven't looked into tracking savings or other accounts yet, but my finances are fairly basic. I have student loans and a checking/savings account but no credits cards.",best money managing app

You can't slide metal along the notes to make it sound different, you can't slide your finger down to make it sound different, you can't make a beat at the same time, you can't slightly bend the neck to create a new sound, you can't during a song detuned pat of the piano to give a new feel to a song. You can't wiggle your fingers in a certain way to again change the sound. For me there seem to be more ways to express yourself using a guitar.

47155,"Go to some national state parks. Out in western USA are some of the most beautiful sites in all nature. 

You think you've seen trees? Go see a Sequoia and everything else will seem like a twig in comparison. 

Not afraid of heights? There is a spot on the grand canyon with a glass walkway above empty space. 

The Rocky mountains are always a site to behold, as is all of Yellowstone. On the east-coast we've got the Florida everglades, the Appalachian trail, and Niagra-mother-fucking-Falls. 

That's just the tip of the iceberg. If you want ""cities"" to visit I suggest NYC, Washington DC, Chicago, STL, San Fransico, Denver, LA, New Orleans and anything else listed by folks here.",best state to visit in the United States

40993,"Agreed, although you could argue it as a high-risk-high-reward type deal for the brass instruments. There are things that pro trumpet players can't accomplish on their instrument that any piano novice can do passably well, but the corollary of that is that when a pianist plays a trumpet piece verbatim it sounds like a novice.

As a brass player myself (I know, real subtle clue in my username), I'll often just for the hell of it take the pieces I'm trying to learn and play them on piano, and unless it has a bunch of really fast 16th runs or something of the sort I'll have mastered it within 10 minutes. And I'm not even remotely good at piano.",best instrument to play

67574,"Thanks!

Btw if you try to use the `curly` async API, there is currently a bug with `curly.get`, so for `GET` requests use just `curly(url, options)`. This has been fixed already but I'm holding a new release until the end of the week.

The API is probably not the cleanest available, but the package tries to follow `libcurl` conventions when possible.

There are currently prebuilt binaries for most platforms, so you should not have any need to compile the addon locally.",axios alternatives reddit
