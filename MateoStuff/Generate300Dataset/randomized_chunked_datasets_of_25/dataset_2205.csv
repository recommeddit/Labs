8955,"No. In fact, the trend has been to continue professional fluoride treatments in-office for people who are high risk.

The teeth are in a constant cycle of either demineralization or remineralization. Tooth enamel is mostly made up of a crystal structure called hydroxyapatite. When the calcium is dissolved out of the structure, fluoride molecules bind the calcium present in your saliva and assist in re-integrating them into a new structure called fluorapatite, which is natually more resistant to future breakdown.",best toothpaste

31119,Not ignorant at all! We are very strong in our wool farming and processing! But not so much in clothing manufacturing - it’s all sent overseas to be made.

27364,"VWAGY - will be an international player for EVs and take a lot of market share from Tesla. Underlooked by comparison to some hype EV stocks. Should do great in the 2020s.  
  
GOOG - self explanatory. they are working on a lot of technical projects that haven't come to fruition. They have some of the best engineers. They'll probably hit something big one of these days. I can see a lot of potential growth- it's just not clear where in the next decade it will come the most.  
  
SOFI - growth stock. jack of all trades fintech. expected to get a bank charter soon, which tends to jack up the share price as it will massively expedite them to profitibility. They also have Sofi Stadium in LA, where the superbowl in a few months will be. I could see this being a multibagger in the next decade, for sure. Riskier than the above.  
  
GS - king of banking stocks  
  
RBOT - Vicarious Surgical- make sure you don't get the wrong stock- They won't have any revenue for years, if they ever get approved. But they have patents on technology for their new style of surgery robotics, which make them hard to copy. It looks extremely impressive and futuristic. The dexterity is miles beyond the current market leader. A surgeon tried their prototype and rapidly was able to do procedures with it. There are big names jumping in on this recently.

I’ve been buying these cases ever since I got my iPhone 7.

Dropped my 11 Pro Max from 6 ft onto concrete face down more times than I’d like to admit, and on the corner a similar number of times. 

My phone and my case look the same as the day i got it. 

It’s even been slid across concrete and looking at it, you can’t tell at all.

Seriously, don’t take my word for it. Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/ofkvQFsXUTc) that sold me on it when I bought my first mous case. (Skip to 4:00 if you want to see the good stuff)

39910,"uBlock Origin is getting a lot of posts (and for good reason, that shit is great), but one I really love is [AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/), it not only blocks ads, but it ***reports a click signal to the ad itself*** so that your ad profile gets fucked up and the data received by advertisers is meaningless! In fact, it worked so well that google decided to block adnauseam from their store. You can still get it of course, but you need to enable developer mode. I wish it were more popular because this doesn't just block ads, but it actually fucks with advertisers business model in ways they really can't counter.",best Chrome extensions
