19795,best workout music,"Their last album is so good. These guys just come with it. They know what their fans will like and you are guaranteed to get Hyped. 

Does anyone know if they will ever drop another album?"
8955,best toothpaste,"No. In fact, the trend has been to continue professional fluoride treatments in-office for people who are high risk.

The teeth are in a constant cycle of either demineralization or remineralization. Tooth enamel is mostly made up of a crystal structure called hydroxyapatite. When the calcium is dissolved out of the structure, fluoride molecules bind the calcium present in your saliva and assist in re-integrating them into a new structure called fluorapatite, which is natually more resistant to future breakdown."
27727,best bollywood actor,Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai? Reddit has a word limit for titles. Had to shorten the name to write the entire title.......
31119,best country to live in,Not ignorant at all! We are very strong in our wool farming and processing! But not so much in clothing manufacturing - it’s all sent overseas to be made. My brand is looking as manufacturing in NZ at the moment but it’s outrageously expensive and not very sustainable.
62081,Best RPG game on PS4,I'd go for odyssey. It's one of the better ones with rpg elements. Reminds me of the witcher without the fantastic story
73573,best battery bank,What's the name of that Nintendo stitch sub?
27730,best bollywood actor,I wish I could gild this 😂😂💀💀 take this instead 🏅
38428,best newspapers to read,I love the Times Reader. Doing the crossword on that is so much easier.
27364,best stocks to buy,"VWAGY - will be an international player for EVs and take a lot of market share from Tesla. Underlooked by comparison to some hype EV stocks. Should do great in the 2020s.  
  
GOOG - self explanatory. they are working on a lot of technical projects that haven't come to fruition. They have some of the best engineers. They'll probably hit something big one of these days. I can see a lot of potential growth- it's just not clear where in the next decade it will come the most.  
  
SOFI - growth stock. jack of all trades fintech. expected to get a bank charter soon, which tends to jack up the share price as it will massively expedite them to profitibility. They also have Sofi Stadium in LA, where the superbowl in a few months will be. I could see this being a multibagger in the next decade, for sure. Riskier than the above.  
  
GS - king of banking stocks  
  
RBOT - Vicarious Surgical- make sure you don't get the wrong stock- They won't have any revenue for years, if they ever get approved. But they have patents on technology for their new style of surgery robotics, which make them hard to copy. It looks extremely impressive and futuristic. The dexterity is miles beyond the current market leader. A surgeon tried their prototype and rapidly was able to do procedures with it. There are big names jumping in on this recently. Do your own D&D and average in- it's on a run right now."
28394,best breakfast foods,"With a little honey, banana, and other fruit (diced apple, strawberries, blueberries). Amazingly filling, super-quick."
35380,best alcoholic drink,"Old fashioned!!! 

But if I really feel like drinking I go straight to an AMF  :)"
22088,best celebrity,"Lady Gaga. She gave me a huge hug, listened to me, genuinely thanked me for my support, and had someone from her team come over to look at my homemade outfit that was based on one of her outfits."
61850,Best RPG game on PS4,Exploration. Loads of it haha
65799,best college in california,Same! You a poly grad?
51520,best iphone case,"I will always recommend the [mous case](https://www.mous.co/collections/phone-cases) to anyone that asks. (No referral links, I dont get paid at all for this)

I’ve been buying these cases ever since I got my iPhone 7.

Dropped my 11 Pro Max from 6 ft onto concrete face down more times than I’d like to admit, and on the corner a similar number of times. 

My phone and my case look the same as the day i got it. 

It’s even been slid across concrete and looking at it, you can’t tell at all.

Seriously, don’t take my word for it. Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/ofkvQFsXUTc) that sold me on it when I bought my first mous case. (Skip to 4:00 if you want to see the good stuff)

Here’s [my phone](https://imgur.com/a/BhbLp5c/) that I’ve had since release day."
43151,best detective show,Whoop.. Didn't know this
47399,best state to visit in the United States,"If you have a friend in LA, LA is the best place to go to (random little stuff is the best)."
6768,best iPhone,X. We will finally update this year.
39910,best Chrome extensions,"uBlock Origin is getting a lot of posts (and for good reason, that shit is great), but one I really love is [AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/), it not only blocks ads, but it ***reports a click signal to the ad itself*** so that your ad profile gets fucked up and the data received by advertisers is meaningless! In fact, it worked so well that google decided to block adnauseam from their store. You can still get it of course, but you need to enable developer mode. I wish it were more popular because this doesn't just block ads, but it actually fucks with advertisers business model in ways they really can't counter."
52448,best hiphop album,"comparing it to the albums that came after it, Illmatic is outdone in many areas. The only reason 50% of people list it in their top albums of all time is so they don't piss off Nas fanboys."
5071,best home improvement store,The HDs by me all allow pets on leash.
41402,best instrument to play,"> There are few things it can't do in relation to other instruments, but when it can, or can e manipulated to do so easily then other instruments are basically pointless.

Lol what. This is parody, right? Piano is fine but it can't replace having a string or air column to push on directly."
17140,best iOS game,"Thank you for the swift and full reply.. I will invest some more time into soon . 
Thanks red :)"
71524,best movies with a cool twist,"I thought that was actually really well done, especially for a kids' movie. There's subtle hints throughout the film, but you don't see the connection until it's revealed. It actually took me by surprise too."
51687,best iphone case,dat camera hole tho
