"Ghost of Tsushima for sure. 
Immortals Fenyx Rising is also a pretty decent game."

"Thank you, though not useful now, when I eventually get a new desk and can have both my monitors roughly level with eachother, this will be hugely helpful."
"Trombone is pretty fun to play. You can do a lot of interesting things with it and its just so unique. French horn is fun as well and is one of my favorite sounding instruments. 

The worst is the flute. Fuck that instrument. My ex wife was a professional flutist for a few years and even she agreed that it was no fun to play. It's just very uncomfortable to play."
It feels like it leaves a film on my mouth.
"> but not for the humanities.

that depends. there are disciplines within the humanities that aren't even taught outside of applied sciences universities (like social work studies). The reality is a bit too complex to map it onto these simple ranking algorithms."
That's like calling a Song of Ice and Fire a children's book just because some of the main characters are kids.
Yeah I'm going to get back into it soon.
"For France another important point was not mentioned earlier:
A lot of universities, graduate school or research institues have multiples campus with one official administrative headquarter in Paris. Some institutes ares ""network"" of universities. The heading of a french research paper could be really misleading regarding where the research took place. The actual name and place of the lab could be in the third or fourth position.  

For example, for my master thesis, the first name was Paristech, it is a network Parisian engineering school (Only one of them still have a campus inside Paris), the second name was the Paris head quarter of the school, third the name was the industrial partner, and fourth was the actual lab at a campus in the east of France.

The same happen in all field (CNRS, INRIA, EHESS).

This is done on propose. The small institutions could not get international visibility without regrouping. So now every institution in part of a network, federation, mother institution with a fancy Parisian adresse and all research seem to come from Paris."
Just saying: Fuck Opera. Get away from that.
Xbox has an ergonomic controller at least for my hands
"Honestly I can't really think of any since the mid to late 2000s NFS games...

Gran Turismo 5 kind of had that, but msot of the recent racing games are just social media clout stuff simulators or focusing on online sadly"
Wallingford had one that has been there for years. Like the “downtown” Wallingford strip. The other is Chen’s village in the inter bay. Enjoy my friend. Have one for me.
This is my issue.
