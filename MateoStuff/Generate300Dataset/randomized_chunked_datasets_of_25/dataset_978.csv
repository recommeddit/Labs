31926,"I'm not being butt hurt, just trying to save someone else the 30 mins I've wasted not getting any quotes from this company who is supposed to provide quotes.
Like, that's the trade off, right? I give my email so they can sell it for money and junk up my inbox, and they are supposed to provide quotes.
Instead, I have a 33mb app that doesn't do anything on my phone and new spam mail, and I still don't have any quotes. 
I feel like that's worth mentioning to anyone who is actually trying to find housing, as this has not provided any useful solutions in the time i have been trying to use it.

They withdrew 5,000 dollars and asked for it in one of those unmarked money bags. They then proceeded to full on sprint out of the bank and back to his car. Seems like a fun dude.",best celebrity

Last I saw, the Nvidia/Arm deal sounded like it's more and more likely to fall through. But disregarding that, I don't think Nvidia will go anywhere with Arm even if it goes through. They'll be a safe stock to hold, but AMD is more likely to grow.

If I had to choose between only the two, I would pick AMD myself.",best stocks to buy

23083,"My mom met tons of celebrities working as a nurse at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles in the 80s and 90s. The nicest she met was David Prowse who played Darth Vader. He showed up in the one of the actual Vader suits used in the original trilogy complete with lights and breathing sounds to surprise the kids. He was flanked by two stormtroopers and an Imperial officer. Some of the younger kids were frightened so he came back later with out the suit on to sign autographs and take pictures. Dustin Hoffman was the one that she said was the rudest. He visited while around the time of filming Hook and came off as not wanting to be there at all. Rude to the staff, didn‚Äôt want to sign anything, etc.",best celebrity
