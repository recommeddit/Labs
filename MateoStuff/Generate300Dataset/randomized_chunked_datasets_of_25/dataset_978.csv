31926,best hotel to live in,"I'm not being butt hurt, just trying to save someone else the 30 mins I've wasted not getting any quotes from this company who is supposed to provide quotes.
Like, that's the trade off, right? I give my email so they can sell it for money and junk up my inbox, and they are supposed to provide quotes.
Instead, I have a 33mb app that doesn't do anything on my phone and new spam mail, and I still don't have any quotes. 
I feel like that's worth mentioning to anyone who is actually trying to find housing, as this has not provided any useful solutions in the time i have been trying to use it.
This is useful information that is relevant to the topic."
16136,best sunglasses for fashion,Shwood and Raen are pretty good brands. You get the higher end stuff without supporting Luxottica also
20406,best workout music,Trap music. I like to sell drugs in my mind while working out.
8078,best toothpaste,"Yes! Be careful not to increase the pressure you apply to your teeth and gums, though. The pulsating brush action actually increases the 'stokes-per-minute' which is a seemingly common concern on this website."
70584,best major to study in college,"All good suggestions, thank you"
62250,Best RPG game on PS4,"Odyssey is a great game, but its a terrible Assassin's Creed game. My favorite is Black Flag, but I know its not a great AC game. I would do anything for a BF 2"
54522,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Yes! This has been me as well! I got a bunch of pads, then tried hien and zero and decided to stop buying other pads. I eventually tried the glorious ice and decided to just get shidenkai to see the difference... For me the shidenkai blows it out I'd the water! I'm an Artisan for life fan üëç!"

22738,best celebrity,"I remember reading a story about him from someone who lived in the same town as he did in Ohio. The author was a bank teller at a small bank and in walks Dave Chappelle with his son. They withdrew 5,000 dollars and asked for it in one of those unmarked money bags. They then proceeded to full on sprint out of the bank and back to his car. Seems like a fun dude."
5036,best home improvement store,"I think its regional, Home Depot here has really good customer service, Lowe's just seems confused. Also Lowes is full of gimmicky garbage tools."

I have joint/muscle pain and it's been much better since I started slow-cooking myself overnight."
71129,best movies with a cool twist,Parasite. The movie that won all those Oscars last year.
27243,best stocks to buy,"My feeling is AMD is poised better to take market share from Intel.

Last I saw, the Nvidia/Arm deal sounded like it's more and more likely to fall through. But disregarding that, I don't think Nvidia will go anywhere with Arm even if it goes through. They'll be a safe stock to hold, but AMD is more likely to grow.

If I had to choose between only the two, I would pick AMD myself."

23083,best celebrity,"My mom met tons of celebrities working as a nurse at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles in the 80s and 90s. The nicest she met was David Prowse who played Darth Vader. He showed up in the one of the actual Vader suits used in the original trilogy complete with lights and breathing sounds to surprise the kids. He was flanked by two stormtroopers and an Imperial officer. Some of the younger kids were frightened so he came back later with out the suit on to sign autographs and take pictures. Dustin Hoffman was the one that she said was the rudest. He visited while around the time of filming Hook and came off as not wanting to be there at all. Rude to the staff, didn‚Äôt want to sign anything, etc."
