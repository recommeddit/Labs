38161,"It's really interesting that you think that, because the majority of fans and critics alike agree that Infinity War is the superior film. It has better pacing, a better blend of action and story, and is more self-contained than Endgame. Since Endgame serves as a soft conclusion to the entire MCU it is tying up so many loose threads whereas Infinity War had room to breathe and is a better standalone movie. What I find most interesting is that your main critique is that it is nothing but quips and Endgame threw away much of the character arcs to instead make them caricatures. Out of the main characters presented in Endgame, Iron Man, Ant Man, Rocket, Hulk, and Thor served as comic relief. 

Infinity War is also a remarkably focused film considering how many characters' storylines had to converge at the same time. We see the culmination of Tony Stark’s fears of a threat too great for him to handle, Thor finally fighting back after losing everything dear to him, and Captain America’s refusal to “trade lives,” and it’s all told through the lens of Thanos’ quest to collect the Infinity Stones.  With Thanos’s early death, a meandering time jump, and the haphazard “Time Heist” that drags out the second act, *Endgame* is far less focused and sharp than its predecessor. 

Infinity War also has a far less muddled plot. It sees the Avengers split into three distinct groups across the cosmos, with their scenes structured around Thanos’ quest to collect the Infinity Stones. The geography and timeline all make perfect sense, which is astounding for an epic of this scale. Endgame on the other hand has a muddled plot that leaves the audience scratching its heads for half of it because, thanks to Marvel’s reshoots, there are two sets of time travel rules established in the film.

I'd very much like to hear your rebuttal if you can! I'm so bored in lockdown that arguing about movies is nice distraction for me! Also, can any Blankies back me up? Am I crazy? Who do you agree with?",best Marvel movie

AliExpress cables are cheaper and work better than the crap I have to buy for 15€ a piece at our local store. The local ones either don't work or loose contact if you hold it a certain way.

The prescription is perfect, the frame doesn't feel flimsy, and you can even choose the darkness level of the lenses.
