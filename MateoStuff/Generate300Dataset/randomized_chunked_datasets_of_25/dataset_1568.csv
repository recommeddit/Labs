65640,best phone service company,"Pageplus(verizon) 55$ for 60gb. Is there better on verizon? Not sure about ebay sellers.

Att is the go/ipad data plan at 35$ monthly. If you use no more then say 5gb then the redpocket annual at 20 dollars monthly is it. 

Im sure someone else here can better address tmobile and sprint."
43111,best detective show,"Jonathan Creek.

Usually, at the beginning of each episode, some kind of mysterious, ""impossible"" crime happens, and the title character uses his deductive powers and the skills he has learnt as a magic prop constructor to figure it out.

I watched a bunch of episodes several years back and I think I had a pretty good rate of solving it by the end... better than 50%, I'm pretty sure.

Like with trying to figure out a magic trick, I start by thinking, ""One of the things that *appeared* to happen didn't actually happen. What was it?"""

27757,best breakfast foods,"hey I only have a kettle, no coffeemaker. Can you help me out with a suggestion on how I can make coffee. I tried the grinds and it keeps going in my mouth and it’s disgusting. I tried nestle instant coffee and that’s pretty gross too."
32415,best vacation resort,"Ugh yes, forgot about that :( such a stupid thing to have!!! I signed a petition against it once. I have no idea why this is still going on there"
42522,best detective show,"That's pretty hyperbolic. Season 2 was fairly decent and had a very tough act to follow, and would've been fine as a standalone show. If season 2 had came out before season 1, there would've been very little criticisms at all and just praises for how a good show got even better."
32175,best hotel to live in,"Havsvidden Resort in Geta, Åland Islands.  Gorgeous scenery, fancy if you wanted it."
70854,best movies with a cool twist,"The most incredible bit about ""Predestination"" is that it's such a faithful adaptation of the original short story, even though the original story was nothing more than one scene consisting of characters having a conversation in a bar."

54182,best medicine for a cold,Aleve is Naproxen.  It's probably OTC there.
33877,best Pokemon game,"Black & White and their sequels for story, Heart Gold and Soul Silver for gameplay. Since you already have a 3DS for Moon you can play those without having to buy another system, as you would for Emerald."
24335,best anime,I'm glad to hear you like it.
35194,best alcoholic drink,No no no. Drink half a bottle of jack THEN fill it with coke. No one will be the wiser's.

2978,best webcamera,I believe that Sony has been beating Bose on noise-canceling with their WH line of headphones
33024,best energy drink,"For me Monster Ultra Blue. I wasn't too sold on it at first, then after my 2nd can of it I was hooked. It's so addictive and refreshing but sweet. I find it so moreish because its light and crisp.

But Ultra Red I find super delicious too, something nostalgic about it like red slush puppy from when I was a child!

Otherwise original Rockstar energy is delicious. Tastes so good.

As you can tell I drink energy drinks for the flavour, not necessarily the energy itself aha"
32660,best vacation resort,I'll keep this really short since Google will tell you all you need to know: Go to [Namale](http://www.namalefiji.com/).
28522,best breakfast foods,"Cut some white onions throw in a pan and cook in some oil.

Throw in some bacon (I prefer turkey bacon, but I won't judge).

Whip up two eggs in a bowl with some salt and pepper.

Pour that into the pan.

Walk away for a bit.

Come back and flip it. (If you screw up, then you just might as well scramble it all).

Walk away again.

Come back and it's done.

I've been making this almost every morning since my time at university. You can add boadt or whatever. Mix it up with some different leftover meat from dinner the night before once in a while. It's good, simple, and once you got the timing down, you can kind of just walk away from it and do other morning stuff while it cooks."

56744,best desktop monitor,I couldn't be more happy with the price ($130~) I paid for one of these.
52410,best hiphop album,"How isn't it top 10? There's so many great albums that have done more for hip hop than Madvilliany. It's a Classic, sure. But did it do what the Chronic did? What about Ready to Die? What about All Eyes On Me? Is it at genre defying as 808s and Heartbreaks was? No. But it's a great album."
