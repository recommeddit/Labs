"while i dont disagree, i dont think the old ""celebrated"" nfs games aged well at all. if you want a modern nfs game, nfs heat is perfectly fine imo"
Neither of those is a language.
Aero press with stainless steel filter.
Former east coaster here. I ordered Rusty’s once when I moved here fifteen years ago. The end.
"Fair enough. 

Might wanna put up a link to some docs or guides or something on the website, nobody likes having to sign up before they even know if they want to."
"I always hear people talk about how horrible California is but I love this state.  Adding this to the list of reasons why.

I mean, there are many things we could improve but I would not want to live anywhere else!"
Just got my first Sonicare last month.  There is a HUGE difference between it and any other electric toothbrush I've owned.  Definitely worth the extra money.
Probably around 1k

Floor jack and 4 steel rims for the winter tires.
"What's your point? The only thing British about the organization is the fact that they are based out of London. The Economist doesn't even remotely limit itself to British topics. It is a global company. They cover anything and everything that the magazine finds important. In fact, in their most recent magazine, their was little, if any, mention of Britain. The latest edition talked about artificial intelligence, financial technology (FinTech), war in Syria, Germany's influence and dominance in Europe, Danish politics, Italy's constitutional reform, global warming and its relation to our current weather experiences, internet firm acquisitions and dominance by major players, manufacturing in America, anti-bribery business, Indonesia's new president and their thoughts on how he will impact their economy and future, progress in behavioral economics, Saudi Arabia's stock market and its opening to foreign investment, international bond markets, banks thinning their retail branch networks around the world, the relationship between ageing and inflation in Japan's economy, America's Navy and their plans for electrically powered superguns, a bunch of science topics and research recognition, the evolution of music, the future of museums in America, myths surrounding American history and the founding fathers, book reviews, financial data... 

The company covers American topics more than it covers British topics."

Love this case.  I've dropped my phone multiple times.  And it's still perfectly fine.  That's being dropped on concrete, asphalt, rocks, dirt etc.  working in my field I need a case that's not too big and bulky but also protect wells.  This case is slim and stream line and feels like it's built like a tank.  When you put it on you can be worry free about drops because when it does drop it makes a completely different sound from any other case I've heard.  The sound of protection.

No cringing or winces when you see it falling to the floor in slow motion.

Edit: fixed link.  It comes in multiple colors."
"All One is liquid soap, thankfully."
"Still the same. No change. Pakistan won more that decade but they also played more ODIs than any other team.

South Africa (110 W, 61 L)  
Australia (140 W, 81 L)  
Pakistan (146 W, 105 L)"
Seconded.
Dirt 5 after the patches runs like a dream on series x. Crazy visuals with all the weathers and lgihting effects. If yoir tv had good hdr the lighting is crazy bright
"Genuinely curious as to why you have listed Nioh as an Action RPG, whereas Nier as a ""game with RPG elements""?

Aside from visual appearance of armor, I can't see any world where Nioh has more RPG traits than Nier... again, just curious as to your thought process, not trying to start a feud. 

Having that all been said, I'd absolutely list Horizon Zero Dawn under your games with RPG elements category!

EDIT: Ask an honest quest, get downvoted. k."
"MCU-MJ is based on Ultimate MJ I guess, who is herself very different from her 616-comic part. Tom Holland's Spider-Man takes a lot of the Ultimate Spider-Man-runs with Peter and Miles, which shows a more modern look on the life of a high schooling superhero. So I think the MCU-MJ somehow really fits in as Ultimate MJ."
Brophys is really good!
Thanks caup! Could they add your guide to the sidebar in the AT sub?  It’s so helpful.

History. There's just something about the subject.
