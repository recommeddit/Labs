33503,"Society has pushed for SUVs and trucks over sedans, hence the models coming out and hence the shrinking ICE sedan market.

SUVs and trucks are easier to sneak margin markups too. Sedan R&D is probably hard to justify and cover up. Sedans would be fighting $20-30K Camrys and Accords and such, while making an EV price competitive with a $50-70K Grand Cherokee or Q5 or Equinox is easier.",best electric car

FYI [not all freezers will work well in garage and/or lower temperatures](http://www.green-energy-efficient-homes.com/freezer-in-garage.html). Frigidaire was only brand recommended for garage use.   Misc comments:  My buddy found a used commercial freezer from a store closing on CL for his garage, works great.  A chest freezer is more efficient than upright, it's lowest cost selection. Auto defrost feature will add to monthly cost but reduces cleaning/maint.",best freezer brand

India has a tradition of producing spin and batting tracks so we are good at producing batsman and decent spin bowlers, we are not so good at producing fast bowlers like other countries(Aus/Pak/Eng/NZ/SA/WI). For me Aussies are well balanced among all teams in terms of fast bolwer,spin,batsman,fielders and sledging.",best cricket teams of all time

68347,"My favourite book I've read. I don't even know that I can fully quantify why I love it. I just do.

Definitely is a large investment but the pay off of the world building was worth it (for me) for the last third of the novel. Especially compared to the more anticlimactic pay off of Cryptonomicon (which I also loved). Nearing the end I actually slowed down my reading pace because I didn't want it to finish.

Great characters and great ideas. Been about 5 years since I read it and I still catch myself thinking  about certain aspects of the book or using phrases in my head from time to time. I should read it again...",best science fiction novel

31843,"Last year Capital Cities played a show at the Downtown Grand pool that started at 10am. You didn't have to be staying at the Downtown Grand to go, nor did staying at the Downtown Grand guarantee you a ticket. They gave away wristbands on a first come first serve basis on Friday. If you got a wristband, you got to go to the show.

I believe this is the only time the festival has done something like this. They have done pool parties at The Plaza in past years, but not with a band playing the festival. Technically, you did have to be staying at The Plaza to attend, unless someone staying there could get you in.

If LIB does anything like this again this year, it will be announced close to the festival.",best hotel to live in
