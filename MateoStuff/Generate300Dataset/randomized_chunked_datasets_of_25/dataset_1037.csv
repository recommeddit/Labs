58208,best cologne,"I love coming home from work smelling like 2 stroke, chain oil and wood shavings."
4201,best text editor,"Yep, it is, but not as faster as Sublime yet :("
35058,best NFL player,What does iconic mean for football? English not my first language.
21066,best workout music,I got a suggestion for you.  This one has been a favorite of mine for awhile - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h0SswsOsEo&list=FLxN_O70ekJGTNv3VnF78oSg&index=21
73136,best Linux distro,"I must say just try arch and from there you will see transition to other distro very fast and easy.

18199,best YouTube video,"No matter how many times I watch that video, that part right there gets me. Every time."
68385,best science fiction novel,"Player of Games is usually cited as the best way to enter the series or a favorite, but I think more suggest Use of Weapons and Excession as his greatest works more often."
65586,best phone service company,Livermore is weird because Verizon either works perfectly or it’s completely dead
33503,best electric car,"Society has pushed for SUVs and trucks over sedans, hence the models coming out and hence the shrinking ICE sedan market.

SUVs and trucks are easier to sneak margin markups too. Sedan R&D is probably hard to justify and cover up. Sedans would be fighting $20-30K Camrys and Accords and such, while making an EV price competitive with a $50-70K Grand Cherokee or Q5 or Equinox is easier."
6897,best iPhone,"I now use the 2020 SE aswell, but it just made me realize how little I care about processor specs, etc. these days. Barely use my phone for anything more than typical PDA functionality, listening to music, typing messages and, well, calling people."
18868,best YouTube video,"Haha, this sounds like something that would have been on rick and morty."
60219,best freezer brand,"Did the same thing when we downsized to a condo a couple years ago. Added a mid size upright Frigidaire freezer in garage.  FYI [not all freezers will work well in garage and/or lower temperatures](http://www.green-energy-efficient-homes.com/freezer-in-garage.html). Frigidaire was only brand recommended for garage use.   Misc comments:  My buddy found a used commercial freezer from a store closing on CL for his garage, works great.  A chest freezer is more efficient than upright, it's lowest cost selection. Auto defrost feature will add to monthly cost but reduces cleaning/maint."
27521,best bollywood actor,"Haha these are all the people, rather stars I like. Doesn't really reflect on their talent or my all time fav films. I love a lot of work ranveer, Akshay, aamir etc have done."

25787,best cricket teams of all time,"Not to confuse you but it all depends on how the tracks are prepared in home country. India has a tradition of producing spin and batting tracks so we are good at producing batsman and decent spin bowlers, we are not so good at producing fast bowlers like other countries(Aus/Pak/Eng/NZ/SA/WI). For me Aussies are well balanced among all teams in terms of fast bolwer,spin,batsman,fielders and sledging."
61001,Best comedy show on Netflix,I think they have the first few seasons of MASH now.  Definitely the best series of all time.
7070,best iPhone,"How do you manage with phones then? Till very recently nothing went above 60Hz, and it's all a lot closer to your eyes..."
15663,best sunglasses for fashion,"I went with the 50 mm, but it really depends on what size your face is."
68347,best science fiction novel,"My favourite book I've read. I don't even know that I can fully quantify why I love it. I just do.

Definitely is a large investment but the pay off of the world building was worth it (for me) for the last third of the novel. Especially compared to the more anticlimactic pay off of Cryptonomicon (which I also loved). Nearing the end I actually slowed down my reading pace because I didn't want it to finish.

Great characters and great ideas. Been about 5 years since I read it and I still catch myself thinking  about certain aspects of the book or using phrases in my head from time to time. I should read it again..."
34522,best NFL player,"Probably not. 

He'd take off shirt, kick you in the nuts, and then body slam you."
13159,best gifts for mom,Crotchless panties. It's a gift for her AND me.
14066,best place to get free books,Thank you! It was the pop up that wasn’t showing up. ♡
31843,best hotel to live in,"Last year Capital Cities played a show at the Downtown Grand pool that started at 10am. You didn't have to be staying at the Downtown Grand to go, nor did staying at the Downtown Grand guarantee you a ticket. They gave away wristbands on a first come first serve basis on Friday. If you got a wristband, you got to go to the show.

I believe this is the only time the festival has done something like this. They have done pool parties at The Plaza in past years, but not with a band playing the festival. Technically, you did have to be staying at The Plaza to attend, unless someone staying there could get you in.

If LIB does anything like this again this year, it will be announced close to the festival."
9109,best toothpaste,Really? Because I feel like my sensitivity got worse after I started using it. I don't know....maybe I just got lazy when brushing..
52639,best hiphop album,I personally felt The Low End Theory was better; but Midnight Marauders was awesome.  Good list
