7275,best iPhone,I was in a similar situation as yours. I just bought an XR and I’m loving it. Judging by your intended usage I don’t think the extra cost for the 11 is worth it especially if its huge ( currently around 210 dollars in my country) plus the AirPods Pro would be the cherry on top!

Honorable Mentions:  Planetes, Gurren Lagaan, Samurai Champloo, Your Lie in April, Dorohedoro, Violet Evergarden, Madoka Magica, Girl's Last Tour, Monster, Great Pretender, Promised Neverland (S1), Dorroro, Magi, and the hypemaster that is Demon Slayer

Shows others like but I have not finished/started:  AoT (honestly got bored after S2ish, but heard it gets so great I'll ahve to revisit),  Re:Zero (only watched S1 and thought it was decent, similarly heard it gets much better), LoGH (waiting for a decent streaming option), Hunter x Hunter (can't get over the childish animation...), JoJo (eventually check out on Netflix?), Mob Pyscho (will watch soon on HBO now that I'm over the animation style)

Honestly my top like 30 (of about 80 shows) are all highly recommended so it's quite hard to compare.  Oh and as hinted, I only included series (not movies or very short OVA's, etc.)"
