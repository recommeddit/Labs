29762,best money managing app,"Yes, the first 34 days are free - there is a fee after that - and typically after 2-3 months of using it, you'll have developed enough new habits in saving money, planning for your future, avoiding overdraft charges, etc etc that the fee ""pays for itself"" in a majority of cases."
34979,best NFL player,"The ""back end"" (wide receivers outside the top tier that obviously deserve to get ranked in a year) is always near impossible to get right. Every year I've ranked after the top 4 receivers I could put the next 7 or 8 in any order and it will always come out right and wrong simultaneously.

But i guarantee my asshole is cleaner than yours. Ladies love it. Definitely helps when you have the fire shits, also saves on paper consumption."
13645,best research paper archive,"The career incentives for scientists are to get published in the most prestigious journals in their field, not just to publish somewhere online. That said, some communities have done pretty much what you said. The ArXiv has been going for decades: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv)"
25771,best cricket teams of all time,The match fixing honours go to South Africa not Pakistan.
2938,best webcamera,"Yeah but the answer is still somewhat the same. 99% of laptops were still designed and produced before people started to care about them. I'd look at that spec now, but previously i would not have cared.

Furthermore, with the current shortages and the spike in demand for laptops, the pressure to innovate isn't quite there at the moment, so it might still be a while until better cameras become standard."
