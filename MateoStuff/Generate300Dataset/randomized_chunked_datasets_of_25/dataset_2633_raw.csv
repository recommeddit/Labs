I've been happy with my Nimble 20000 mAh portable charger. New company but supposedly more environmentally friendly. 2-year warranty and they allow you to recycle up to a pound of e-waste for free with purchase.
"As with above, I definitely say start at the front. Full Throttle and X2 get horribly long lines and have terrible throughout. Start at Full Throttle, then X2, and continue clockwise. I’ve done the hop around and counterclockwise, but this is the best way to get around. The park is just too massive with no direct route (being essentially a circle around a hill) to hop from one side to the other. The rides on the right side (Goliath, Scream, Twisted Colossus) have much better rider throughput than the left side so it’s better to end there, imo."
Iced oolong tea and peach liqueur...I tried it in Japan and now it's one of my go to cocktails.
"fucking anything with chocolate, anything with mint...fuck you"
"Yep, unfortunately you're right."
"I got this.... friend is too poor to even buy a jacket.  Hence why he almost froze.

But... rather than ask for a jacket (because of course main dude would buy his own friend a gift) friend wants him to buy his mother a waffle maker instead.

Because he loves his mama and can't afford to buy her a gift on his own!

Transferable power of gifts."
"I think I've only eaten at Barbareno four or five times, so this is purely anecdotal, but I've never eaten there when the dining room wasn't mostly full, including the bar."
"In the recent tri-series final, an Australian bowler batting in his usual position of number 8 scored 40 off 37 balls... and both his ODI career batting average and strike rate went *down* as a result. Ridiculous."
"There's two different lens sizes, that guy is wearing the bigger one and has a smallish face"
"Well, I'm not a mother, but I think that I am qualified to opine on this. 

A lot of folks will recommend a ""spa-day"" or a night at a hotel or a really nice meal or something like that. Those are great suggestions. My wife has a $150 gift certificate for a local spa sitting in her bra drawer. And it's been there for 8 months. I gave it to her three months after she had our second son. 

At three months (and in general, quite frankly) my wife had zero interest in going out and doing something without the baby or anything that would require her to adjust from breastfeeding on demand. Not saying it's wrong or right - she just feels really strongly about it. 

So that full body massage and haircut (which she said she needed - I was listening, dang it!) is just not going to get used by her. 

I'll tell you what she does love though - her Kindle Fire (substitute iPad mini, if that's your thing). All those middle of the night feedings? Slightly mitigated. Stuck in a rocking chair with a lightly sleeping baby and the sound of paper turning wakes him or her up? Never fear, e-reader is here. 

Now, you could whisk me away to /r/hailcorporate for this, but she just loves it. Plus it's small - an iPad is kinda big to juggle with a little person hanging off your tender parts. 

That or certificates to a cleaning service. Those go over pretty well and they're tres practical."
"make the trek to el sitio in goleta and get a torta de adobada.

~~If you are first year~~ get on your bike and go on the bike path to the mesa and go to mesa burger, eh, maybe not that kind of journey requires a beer to make it back actually. but good way to see more than just IV if you want to kill a morning/afternoon"
"I would buy expensive sunglasses at a brick and mortar store. That way you can try loads on and they can be adjusted to your face. 

I know you didn't specifically ask this. But I like to put glasses on my head and so I have learnt to avoid any glasses with nose pads that my hair can get tangled in."
"Home Depot.  
Each time that I find myself in a Lowe's, I feel that my questions are either not answered correctly, or it requires the person that I asked to ask someone else.  
At HD, the employees consistently know where everything I need is and how to help."
"Started Schitt's Creek about a month ago based on a Reddit recommendation, I just hadn't gotten around to it. Can't believe I missed out for so long."
Hitting a drum and playing percussion are two much different things.
"If you check a firearm, you can lock your luggage and nobody is allowed to open it outside of your possession. You do not have to use a TSA lock."
This is like the 3rd post either calling Northgard the best game on iOS or one of the best.  I’ve really enjoyed it so far.  Make sure to turn off the higher performance graphics.  My phone got really hot until I turned it off and honestly I don’t notice a big difference.
"PBS ST is definitely a build-up series. If you just jumped in at the latest episode and don't have a bachelors+ in physics, you'll be hopeless lost by the jargon. But if you binge the series, even if you don't understand the math involved, they do a great job at teaching you the terms and ideas behind everything."
You're just mad because your parents named you after a bottle of water!
"yeah, DOOM didnt really have shit at that point in his life so he probably couldnt mix it properly. that's kind of a reason i like it tho. you can tell that he actually was close to being homeless after his brother died."
I can't see them being as fun as combustion vehicles. They're cool and I think the sector should grow but the day electric/hybrid take over the market I'll be sad.
can confirm el sitio is delicious
"You can dual boot (you'll need to tweak a few things to get it working just right. But the arch wiki is amazing). I recommend the VM just because it makes it abit easier to get your bearings. But if you are ready for it, go for it."
"Trombonist here, can confirm"
"I absolutely love that add-on, it's so interesting and beautiful. So many people ask what it is and how they get it when they see it."
