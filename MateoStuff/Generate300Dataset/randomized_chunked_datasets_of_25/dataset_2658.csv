37079,"If neither of you have visited Kings Dominion or Hersheypark, I highly recommend them. I live near DC, too, and I can't choose between KD, HP, and BGW as my favorite ""local"" park. No matter which one you visit, you're going to get amazing coasters, smooth operations, and a nice atmosphere. I think BGW has the best of all three categories, but the other three aren't bad at all. BGW has the most consistently good lineup, KD has the best ""standout"" coasters, and HP has the best variety. Operations clearly vary per visit, and while I can't recall HP or KD having slow ops, BGW has always memorably impressed me with its efficiency. Finally, BGW is a true theme park that has the most beautiful and immersive atmosphere. KD and HP both have parts that are kind of ugly in my opinion, but they also have some totally gorgeous areas as well. 

I've never been to Six Flags in New Jersey, but I've heard some not-so-nice things about it that can be read in this thread. Cedar Point is literally the greatest place on earth, but that's not a day trip for us down here (and you might need two days to cover everything there anyway!) But for a day trip from DC, you can't go wrong with Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, or Hersheypark.",best amusement park

Honestly, I don't think you can get things shipped from Sephora US to Canada.  If somehow you end up with a voucher you can't use, sure I'd love to get one!  Thanks for the generous offer.  Hope you can figure out a way that works for you, though.  Let me know how it works out :)",best cologne

30294,"**** Carthage vs Rome  (the Punic Wars) ****

I read a lot of history and this is as good as it gets.   On one side, Carthage.  Based in modern day Tunisia it was an immensely rich trading empire with a strong navy and the best mercenary armies money could buy.  Slingshoters from the Baeleric islands,  Numidian african cavalary, Spanish Swordsman and elephants.   On the other side a newly emerging power on the Italian peninsula with an inexhaustable supply of soldiers and incredible grit.  You would not believe the twists and turns in this epic 100 year clash.   Listen to this podcast.  It is a fantastic.  Dan Carlins hardcore history:

http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive/Show-21---Punic-Nightmares-I/Roman-republic-Carthage

There were 3 punic wars lasting 100 years and it ended in the utter annhiliation of an entire civilization.   During the course of the war, there was the biggest naval battle in history with 200,000 troops involved (not surpassed, even in modern times) and 2 of the greatest generals of all times clashed, Hannibal and Scipio.   Rome kept losing battles which would have crippled any normal empire but they were indefatigable, ruthless and their ultimate victory was so cruel and vindictive that if you can keep a dry eye reading about the fall of Carthage then you are a stronger man than me.",best Mexican war to study

Ok, the Human Project gives this great, big dinner for all the scientists and sages in the world. They're tossing around theories about the ultimate mystery: why are all the women infertile? Why can't we make babies anymore? So, some say it's genetic experiments, gamma rays, pollution, same ol', same ol'. So, anyway, in the corner, this Englishman's sitting, he hasn't said a word, he's just tuckin' in his dinner. So, they decide to ask him, they say, ""Well, why do you think we can't make babies anymore?"" And he looks up at 'em, he's chewin' on this great big wing and he says ""I haven't the faintest idea,"" he said, ""but this stork is quite tasty isn't he?"" 

He chuckles and acknowledges our presence... when he stands up to leave my mother tells him that she just has to tell him that he is her favorite actor, that anything he makes, she loves... he walks up to her, kiss her on the had, and tells her she made his day.",best celebrity
47086,"Also, if you're a competent hiker, go below the rim, instead of just peering over it five feet away from your car.

Only four percent of the visitors to the Grand Canyon go below the rim, and that's where the most beautiful and profound part of the canyon is.

Of course, if you don't have any hiking experience, I would advise against it, since some hikes could be difficult and being unprepared is dangerous.",best state to visit in the United States
