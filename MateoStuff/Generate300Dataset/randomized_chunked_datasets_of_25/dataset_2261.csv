62745,"> This goes back to my point that he does not publish his models and thus is not scrutinizable which is to say that he is unverifiable in his claims.

To be blunt, that's a really bad reason to claim that someone isn't a rigorous statistician.  Plenty of people who are rigorous statisticians won't publish their models because they work in an environment where models are considered trade secrets.  And [Fivethirtyeight actually *does* publish its methodology](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-users-guide-to-fivethirtyeights-2016-general-election-forecast/).  This is a detailed description of every model behavior, how they do simulations, how they do trend line adjustments, how they prioritize polls, etc.  Short of publishing the actual model as a binary file, I'm not sure what else you expect from them.",Best Data Science textbook
54860,"I am a graduate student who studies drinking water.  To answer your question directly, brita filters use a media that we call Granular Activated Carbon.  The media is very porous with a large amount of binding sites which adsorb molecules regardless of size.  Actually, the mechanism of filtering by 'sieving' is really not applicable since in tap water you won't have particles that big anyway.  

To simply answer your question if it is 'safer'... in theory yes, but not really.  If you live in a 1st world country your tap water is very very safe and a brita filter will do basically nothing to the microbiological content of the water.  If anything it will actually increase it (although likely not pathogenic) since activated carbon is a good support for biological growth.  The brita filters will remove disinfection by-products from chlorination, organic material, and other trace level contaminants but really the regulated levels of these are already safe.  It will also remove chlorine/chloramines which can contribute to bad taste etc.  If I recall correctly, some brita filters have ion exchange membranes which can potentially remove some metals, but again regulated levels of these are already below a threshold which we believe will have a substantial impact on the health of the general public.",best water filter
55764,"It isn't a war story the way you are thinking of it.  It's a band of adventurers wandering around the world trying to recover something that was stolen.  They are being opposed by an evil empire, yes, but they aren't in an army themselves.  There are a few monsters, but most of the adversaries are human.  It's pretty good overall, though there isn't too much complexity and it plays everything extremely straight.",best action and adventure novel series
