"I don't think the writing is strong enough for it to qualify for something like that (but then again, people handed The Wheel of Time awards for no real reason). 

I *do* think the show will wind up somewhere between BSG and Farscape, however. The acting in the show at times is a little like the writing, but it's strengthened by some strong moments (spinning the drum, the riot on Eros, the full turn in the first episode, some others in season 3 I wouldn't want to spoil here)."
My mom loves him too.
"Interior Design Major.

Best: Development of concept work and seeing an idea come alive

Worst: Having to stare at the screen for 15+ hours"
"Starwood has a good portfolio as well. Not as many properties as IHG, Hilton, or Marriott though."
"Nice list, I am glad to see Gibson on it. It wouldn't hurt my feelings at all to include his first three books. They are very good. 

Also A Deepness in the Sky by Verner Vinge is a great look at consciousness in a very detailed and exciting universe. I highly recommend it."
"Yeah, I feel like we should be like top 5"
"In his dying moments, Piglet did the one thing he knew he could do. He took some honey off of himself and used it to make a smiley face on the piece of bread, much to Pooh’s confusion but whatever he wasn’t going to let that STALE move throw him off."
With feminine hips?
It's 20 quid.  Phones don't even last that long.  It is a moot point to bring up the fact that it will not be true bifl
"I agree, have a Space Grey iPhone 6 with a white Speck Candyshell case. It's a great case and I think the colors go great together."
"My bachelors was in social sciences also. I'd need to pick up an entirely different degree (maybe a 1-year Masters) to do UX, and starting from scratch on experience there. I'm actually on a job roster for the UN right now where it's estimated about 90% of us will be offered jobs, btw, so the International Affairs degree would not necessarily be totally worthless. But it probably wouldn't offer as much flexibility as I'd ideally like to have."
Sadly the mobile hotspot plans are still dook. I'm going to have to go through ATT and do 40GB for $75 :/

"Anne Hathaway.  

We were backstage waiting for her cue to go on started chatting.  She told me how she was such a klutz and we joked around a bit.  Then, when she was called on stage she tripped hard going up the stairs and face planted, then turned around to me and we both started laughing.  

She’s a sweetheart and a genuinely nice person.  I’m glad I got to meet her."
"I love Glory Season. I haven't seen much attention granted to it out in the wild, so I'm glad to see someone else who enjoyed it!"
"Do you go to an IB high school? I do, and the kids there use this all the time."
The official docs are a good place to start with React. Everything else can be learned individually from Google Searches
"Ya, I definitely recommend it!"
"Palm trees, for the aesthetes."
