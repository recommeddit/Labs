35416,"The best white russians IMO are made with E&J brandy (u/rogue_epileptic mentioned it in their suggestion) instead of vodka. E&J is trash if you want actual brandy but if you want sweet caramel flavor in a brandy-proof spirit, it's your goto. In particular, use their XO release.

It kills ANY of the vodka booziness that normal white russians can have if they are too spirit-heavy, so it should be useful for u/itssarakang.

Other people have almost mentioned completely cutting out the cream/milk and doing a shaken egg (dry shake or reverse dry shake preferably) and I can confirm that it improves the drink substantially.

Best part is that E&J costs next to nothing. The Kahlua is what will cost all the money.",best alcoholic drink
