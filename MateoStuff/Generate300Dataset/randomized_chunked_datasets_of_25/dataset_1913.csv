3637,best college for research,"You are counting how many students get into the career or how many finish it??? Because they have something like 2000 people on its 1st year but by the second it may just be 500.

55903,best action and adventure movie,I loved how accurately it depicted life in a video game. Stuff like all the NPCs only being able to say generic pre-assigned lines. I never would’ve thought of that.
35416,best alcoholic drink,"The best white russians IMO are made with E&J brandy (u/rogue_epileptic mentioned it in their suggestion) instead of vodka. E&J is trash if you want actual brandy but if you want sweet caramel flavor in a brandy-proof spirit, it's your goto. In particular, use their XO release.

It kills ANY of the vodka booziness that normal white russians can have if they are too spirit-heavy, so it should be useful for u/itssarakang.

Other people have almost mentioned completely cutting out the cream/milk and doing a shaken egg (dry shake or reverse dry shake preferably) and I can confirm that it improves the drink substantially.

Best part is that E&J costs next to nothing. The Kahlua is what will cost all the money."

68910,best science fiction novel,"I've never gotten the impression that this sub was bigoted in any way and I say this as a Filipino-American. 

I agree with you that this sub does have a certain provinciality; I'm also a member of my local science fiction association and the taste is quite different. I've brought up Tom Sweterlitsch and Greg Egan with them and not many people had read them. I learned of both here, and I'm quite happy with that."
