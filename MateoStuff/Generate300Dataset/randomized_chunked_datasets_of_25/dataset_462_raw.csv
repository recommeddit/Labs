"Here's what I wanna know though...I liked the Pegasus up til #30 mostly because it had great cushioning. After that they got more solid I feel like. And my knees felt it too. I still havent found a good shoe to replace them with, but I have to admit I havent really looked that hard... Mostly cause I keep hoping with every new Pegasus release that they'll go back to amazing cushioning. But alas.. Any tips?"

My SO recently asked me what a Brony is.. I guess he will not have to ask anymore
"ive only seen 2 anime on this list lol, that's cool"
"I respectfully disagree that there are many you could make a reasonable argument for.  I think there are a small handful you could, but I think it's single digits for sure."
"In my limited experience what you're saying are partially not true. As a student at Perris I had good relationships with most of the instructors and some experienced jumpers. Administration at Perris is also awesome, you know, Dan BC. But I do agree that smaller DZs might be more personal. Perris is a big DZ so sometimes it can be impersonal."
"I had a bad addiction to energy drinks.  AMP mostly.  Kicked that habit though.  Smoking also.  but for some reason, I am not seeing the money I am supposed to be saving by not purchasing those items...."
"I’ve stayed at Portofino, Hard Rock and Cabana Bay. Here’s my best to worst ranking:

Portofino- Hands down the most luxurious and relaxing. You’re transported to another place when you come back from a long day at the parks.  It’s nice and quiet and the pools are great. They also just renovated the rooms. 

Cabana Bay - the theming is great and atmosphere is a lot of fun. My only complaint was it’s long distance from the parks (no water taxi) and thin walls. 

Hard Rock - I stayed in a club level room here and honestly was not impressed. I thought the hallway, room and club lounge looked quite dirty for what you’re paying. The rock theme is cool and you can’t beat the closeness to the parks but I deeply regretted not stating at Portofino again."

Both by the same dude. He has good taste but doesn’t wear any fragrance himself."
"I feel like this could become a really good haiku, with a little editing"
Yea I went ahead and picked up a ti84 just now. I actually got a ti89 first but after playing with it a bit it was a bit overwhelming learning all of the new stuff about the calculator so I just went back to what I'm used to which is the ti84

OMG yes! Tony's is absolutely amazing!!!
"I'm guessing there's an age limit of 13 or something =)

But otherwise, the sooner the better, and the more people 'in' your network now, the more data you'll see down the line when you're thinking of applying to company and it turns out that your old college classmate works there now."
"I freaking LOVED Type 0. I wish the combat wouldn't be as clunky and shallow, but the rest is perfection in my opinion. It's the most extremely graphical Final Fantasy I've ever played, the story is tragic and mindblow, the characters are all diverse with different nice playstyles... and the music, holy jesus of RPGs."
So should I use my 24 inch TV with 8 ms response time as my monitor to save some money ?

Yes on outremer. You can get it at Anthropologie. I like oceane the best. Smells good and has staying power on me.

"It's a Ruby site generator, not a VSCode extension, but using them in combination is nice. Especially since VSCode tasks let me control it somewhat nicely"
Movie was incredible. Easily my favorite from last year. Nothing else I’ve seen recently is quite like it.
People who don't use cutting boards make me cry...
