"Damn, seen them all. Great list!"

Anyone who takes a rag and just rubs back and forth on carpet expecting to get the stain out never learned from their mother the correct way to do it. PRESS AND SOAK YOU IDIOT. PRESS. AND SOAK.

"Hey looks like you have a pretty long list already, but i have to add Michael Moorcock's Corum series and Elric of Melniboné series. All high fantasy adventure from the main protagonist viewpoint, swords and magic over politics and intrigue. And there's lots of em, they were written in the 60's through to 80's i think, so there can be a bit of a ""Flash Gordon"" kind of feel. Good entertainment though for sure."
"That was the month that 15% of reviewers were evidently under the influence of some kind of reality altering drug, because that score isn't right."
"Disturbed and Slipknot are the whole reason I listen to metal now. I call them ""gateway bands""."
"It’s hard for me to answer that without being able to see your chart.  If it is primarily decay that you struggle with, fluoride is your best friend.  You can buy a fluoride rinse (store brand is fine), and before you go bed, brush, then floss, then rinse using the fluoride rinse for 30 seconds.  If your teeth aren’t sitting all nice in a row, like picture perfect, it can make it difficult to keep all the little spaces clean... this is when an electric toothbrush can be very helpful.  I hope this helps :)"
I am really sad that there is only one F/F. I love reading F/F and read a lot of M/M but I get the impression that it's harder to publish F/F? I read The Lady's Guide to Celestial Mechanics bc of this sub and loved it!
"How much speed do you want? My gut says hien cause that's a faster game, but if you want even more speed then Raiden or shidenkai."
Toast and cottage cheese. I usually put peanut butter on the toast or I'll do cream cheese and avocado without cottage cheese.
"How about The Deed of Paksenarrion, by Elizabeth Moon? Protagonist runs away from a shepherd's life and arranged marriage to join a mercenary troupe, is involved with a variety of battles and adventures travelling around the country (forests, rivers, mountains), learns life and combat skills on the way."
Thelma and Louise.
"The Gentleman Bastard Sequence by Scott Lynch. Caveat though, there are 7 books planned and only the first 2 are out (the 3rd is due out in October) so it won't be finished for a while."
Chirs Jones #19 is kinda a surprise imo.
"Glad it's working well for you.  I think I'll run in to my local Best Buy, and see if they have any on display that I can look at.  At $99 from them, this seems like a steal."
"my thoughts exactly, plus HR doesn't assume that an online degree equals you have more hardships and work harder..."
This was far from the worst comment.
"no such thing as best browser exist

nothing is simply best no matter what you ask for"
"The real kicker is how long it took people to link boiling water to preventing illness.

It's a bit of a mind bender to think that Pasteur was amongst the first to actually take it seriously enough to bet big on it, in not just one or two fields but three."

"I did a series on sex in the ocean called ""ocean lovin"""
