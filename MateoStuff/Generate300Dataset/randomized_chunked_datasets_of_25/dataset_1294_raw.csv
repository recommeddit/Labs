"My absolute favorite is a Negroni with a few dashes of grapefruit bitters and a splash of soda. (I've only ever made that at home and few bars are likely to have grapefruit bitters, although orange bitters are a good alternative) 

If you want something really fancy, find a Tiki bar; Tiki drinks mostly have long recipes that amount to gloving a heavy slug of rum in fruit juices and syrups, then garnishing elaborately with flowers, mint, tiny umbrellas, lime shells and almost anything else imaginable. (I once had a Tiki drink that was garnished with a banana cut to look like a dolphin with cloves for eyes and a burnt cinnamon stick put in the mouth so it looked like it was smoking a cigar) 

For a surprise, order a glass of Fernet Branca, an Italian amaro once aptly described as, ""mouthwash with delusions of grandeur.""  That said, I genuinely love it, especially with dessert, and my understanding is that it has a certain special popularity among those in the hospitality industry. (Somebody whom I know who has many acquaintances who work in food service told me about the 'Ferrari', a shot of equal parts Fernet Branca and Campari; I've made it a few times, it's... it's something)

If you want to be a troublemaker, order a Ramos Gin Fizz."
Country roooooaaaaadddd
Albinpblacksheep my man
Why wouldnt you just say 5? that would have made sense. and would have been funny.
"I personally recommend [any.do](https://www.any.do/). Even though it is primarily a to do app, it has really good calendar features and is able to sync your tasks accross many different devices. It has a premium version but its free version is pretty complete already."
"3rd party titles refers to games made by companies that are not Nintendo. With the Wii-U they had almost no 3rd party titles so there were very few games at all on the console. With the switch, they are bringing in far more games from other companies."
"In a few years, UCLA and Berkley will be switched"
Nothing really to say than it’s fun ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
A bike.
"Yes, the leak protection of AirVPN's client (""Eddie"") is pretty sophisticated and no provider can touch Air in this matter. Air is ideal for torrenting IMO.

OT:

However, speeds turned out to be a bit disappointing for me; especially the servers in Sweden are painfully slow.

Mullvad yields far better speeds for me, so i am having a hard time making a decision between Air and the Mole. Currently i use both.."

"Riddle me this. “No brand wars” guy have a look at what brands he always shits on. It’s only one singular brand. Pro everything else, shits on one. Causes fights about one. The irony of “no brand wars”."
"please, do yourself AND your dog a favor and do not get a dog. Get a cat."
Hmmm... green tea with lemon and honey. Speed and or sleep. Mostly sleep.
"exactly, ToIlet paper is good for my bowel movements.

Now that you mention, we did not get ToI today coz of Republic Day..... and needless to say i did not go to toilet today."
"Yes. Pick a site, look at the source code, you will see both HTML and Javascript."
"See the kid working his ass off? He'll get one of those jobs too, and he won't ever bitch about not being born into money."
"-Zinc.  Chelated zinc.  Get it at whole foods, or whatever grocery store.

-Garlic.  Chop up 4 or 5 cloves of garlic a day, eat it raw.  Wash it down with a lot of water if necessary.  It's nasty, but it helps.

These two things are a godsend."
Well that’s debatable. There are two schools of thought.

"Nope.  

Art major here, and from that you might think I'm hardly getting by.  It's true, stats don't paint a rosy picture, but a lot of your success depends on other things than *just* your major.  I focused on graphic design.  During college, I was building websites.  After college, I hustled, made connections, and worked freelance outside of my 9-5.

Now I'm heading up a team of designers, and making a very decent six-figure salary.  My head was never in the CS/engineering space, so I'm 100% happy with my choice of major."
Last one I played was forza horizon 2.  Racing games now are indicative of society today; get the feeling of instant satisfaction and participation trophies.
