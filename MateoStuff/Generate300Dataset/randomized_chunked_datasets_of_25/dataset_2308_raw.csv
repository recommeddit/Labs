"I thought cleaners just *did that*, not because of some other shit put in them.

Now you're gonna tell me that bread only leavens because they use yeast in it. Ha."
"I was impressed by Prisoners. The movie does a good job of setting up severel red herrings as to who kidnapper is, but each leaves important clues that tie together to hint at the actual kidnapper. That plus Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhal as the two protagonists each with differing oppinions and approaches to how to find the truth, you find yourself picking sides over which one of them to root for."
"Not really. A little adjustment, but you'll get used to it. Also depends on what you play....faster stuff like cod or apex you might really enjoy that added speed and tracking! More tactical and slow shooters like cs, valorant, and R6 it'll be more of an adjustment, but you'll get there. I'm more on the tactical side myself and I adjusted all the way to shidenkai! Just takes some practice."

"Even this is probably overboard. In all honesty, companies don't expect that you use their products. It's more about being able to maintain their code and implement solutions.

The only reason twitter would care if you use their media platform is if you're going to be working on design or something, and even then, it's likely you could make a strong case for bringing a fresh set of eyes to the table."

"Ok, well, no one's saying anything, so I'll say it. Frost free ones are slightly more complex and on that basis, might be more likely to fail. They will also dry your food out faster because in order to stay frost-free, they need to fluctuate the temperature so that any frost accumulated on the walls can melt.

Basically, to save on electricity and effort, get yourself a non-frost-free (frosty or frost-filled?) chest freezer with a drain plug *near the bottom* (some have them higher up so you have to tilt the damned thing to get all the water out) Make sure you can attach a hose to it. On winter days, you just take the food outside and let the freezer drain into a drain or a bucket.


Edit: Also make sure the baskets are not made of plastic. Some manufacturers still havenâ€™t clued in to the fact that plastic gets brittle in the cold.  I'd rather have something hint at me that I'm about to break it and temporarily bend a little than snap and permanently break after I've overloaded it."

"Depends on where you are.  Flying back from Asia, they went through my bag and even nicely folded all my dirty underwear which had just been stuffed in the bag.  They certainly aren't afraid of a little dirty laundry."
Is this sarcasm? I just looked at a few threads and it seemed ok so far...

No worries! Really if you're happy with your choice there should be no reason to change. But it's still nice to have the option. Like it's not like Windows or Mac where you're stuck on their upgrade cycles. You want to change it's as simple as downloading a new distro.

"Not sure about JBER, but I spent time in Juneau and Fairbanks with T-Mobile. They don't have towers, so you don't get T-Mobile service. I believe they have a contract with GCI so you get their service, but I couldn't get any data transfer at all. I was stuck with phone calls and texts that often dropped or wouldn't send. I switched to AT&T."
46'r reporting in... ADKs have some of the most beautiful lakes and streams in my opinion. There are few places on earth more calming than an ADK stream along a trail.
"From the site:
The entirely student-focused nature of the WSJ/THE US College Rankings means that the results differ significantly from the THE World University Rankings, which have a heavier emphasis on research excellence on a global scale.

My understanding from working in higher education is that in this case the US ranking focuses primarily on student experience / teaching quality, where the world university rankings focus more on research.
