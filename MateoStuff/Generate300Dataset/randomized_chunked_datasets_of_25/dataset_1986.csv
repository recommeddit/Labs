55916,"I went to see it without very high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. The main kid is a pretty good actor (he's Andy Serkis's son), and I hadn't realized that Patrick Stewart had a significant role in it because I don't think he shows up in any of the previews. 

It reminded me of an 80s kid adventure movie with lots of CGI. The main bad guy was genuinely creepy (I thought), but was really flat as a character so that was disappointing. The bad guys are visually intense enough that I can imagine a sensitive 6-year-old having bad dreams because of it. I liked the movie's message, though--it leaves you feeling hopeful.

I suspect that it won't do well at the box office though--it's too intense for really little kids, and comes off as too little-kiddy for the teenage and up crowd. Their target demographic, I'm guessing, is pretty narrow--8-12 years old maybe?",best action and adventure movie

35155,"Found this from a ProFootballTalk article. Couldn't grab the link because my mobile browsers are sometimes funky, but they vote on the list and Pro Bowl at the same time.

""All players are given the opportunity to vote through ballots we send to all 32 teams around Thanksgiving,” NFL Network spokesman Alex Riethmiller told PFT via email.  “For convenience sake, we try to time it with Pro Bowl balloting, so they can do them together.  In addition to ballots collected that way, we also give ballots to many of the players that we interview for our shows.  This year, in total, we received 481 votes.”",best NFL player
