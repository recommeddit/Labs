23461,best car racing video game,"If we're talking about the game engine, graphics and whatnot, I can see your point. But if we considering the sheer bewonderment and nostalgia also how it was ahead of its time, the game deserves to be called memorable, at the very least. 

I haven't checked out NFS Heat though. I'm guessing it's the one with the cops?"

My Bose QC cans in various generations have been saving my sanity since my globetrotting days started in 2009. At least three transoceanic trips a year. I do not know how people can stand eight plus hours of jet noise without a break."

9568,best toothpaste,"My dentist said it doesn't matter which toothpaste you use, as long as you are brushing regularly and properly with bristles not overly hard or soft."
55916,best action and adventure movie,"I went to see it without very high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. The main kid is a pretty good actor (he's Andy Serkis's son), and I hadn't realized that Patrick Stewart had a significant role in it because I don't think he shows up in any of the previews. 

It reminded me of an 80s kid adventure movie with lots of CGI. The main bad guy was genuinely creepy (I thought), but was really flat as a character so that was disappointing. The bad guys are visually intense enough that I can imagine a sensitive 6-year-old having bad dreams because of it. I liked the movie's message, though--it leaves you feeling hopeful.

I suspect that it won't do well at the box office though--it's too intense for really little kids, and comes off as too little-kiddy for the teenage and up crowd. Their target demographic, I'm guessing, is pretty narrow--8-12 years old maybe?"

12390,best gifts for mom,"My parents forced us four kids to take a picture in the same pose every 3-4 years or so, we kind of stopped doing it after a while. So last Christmas my siblings and I decided to recreate the picture for her present, kept everything super secret and stuff. She couldn’t stop crying happy tears after she opened it, even now she’ll stop and smile when she sees it hung up with the others."

35155,best NFL player,"Found this from a ProFootballTalk article. Couldn't grab the link because my mobile browsers are sometimes funky, but they vote on the list and Pro Bowl at the same time.

""All players are given the opportunity to vote through ballots we send to all 32 teams around Thanksgiving,” NFL Network spokesman Alex Riethmiller told PFT via email.  “For convenience sake, we try to time it with Pro Bowl balloting, so they can do them together.  In addition to ballots collected that way, we also give ballots to many of the players that we interview for our shows.  This year, in total, we received 481 votes.”"
37271,best amusement park,I agree but to the GP they may not care nearly as much as an enthusiast. The price is also lower for Michigan’s Adventure but people still spend more to go to Cedar Point.
