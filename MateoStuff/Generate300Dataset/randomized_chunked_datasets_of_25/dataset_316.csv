33783,"By successful, I mean people have been able to post pretty respectable times. I'm not trying to say that they're great track cars. I just think it's unfair to call them ""one trick ponies"" that only accelerate to 60mph well. Especially when you consider their results.


That said, many of the problems you listed have pretty simple solutions. MPP sells camber bolts, tires can be upgraded,and Track mode tones down most nannies and makes the car less prone to understeer while also improving cooling and lap times.",best electric car

38203,"None of them. They're all impossibly biased garbage. That being said, the Associated Press can reliably be counted on to at least report on everything that happens, instead of only covering events that they can twist to make their chosen side look good.
