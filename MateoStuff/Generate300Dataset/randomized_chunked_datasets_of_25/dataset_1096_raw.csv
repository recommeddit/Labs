"I really wholeheartedly loved Strange Love by Ann Aguirre and want to constantly recommend it. Sweet beta alien hero, excellent communication, laugh out loud funny too. Radiance by Grace Draven has a lot of similarities for me and I also loved that."

"It's the son of the author of Winnie the Pooh, aka Christopher Robin, remembering his time in the Hundred Acre Wood as a boy and how horrible his father treated him, eventually dying and reuniting with Pooh."
Very nice list
"I do have a problem with this...  When his wife was president of Burlington not only did a land deal if it were a corporation Bernie would railing away about crony capitalism, but a large part of his platform was his ""free"" college plan...   And his wife tried to make Burlington more expensive and more exclusive.  Since they were the actions of Jane, and not Senator Sanders I try to remove that from my judgement of him, but it is hard not to attribute some hypocrisy to him for it."

"I met [Kid Rock](http://imgur.com/T92uH.jpg) at Coyote Ugly in Las Vegas...I spotted him, gave him the universal what are you drinking sign, he holds up a bud light, and a buddy of mine buys us a round of bud lights and shots and we head over to him. At this point he has just entered the place by a back door and has a security guard right beside him. We get within 5 feet of him and he motions his body guard to stand down as he looked ready to pick my ass up and toss me onto the casino lobby floor. Then we give him the beer and take a shot with him, and just bullshit...with Kid Rock...We talk about the girls dancing on the bar and just whatever. He was really laid back, down to earth guy which I never expected...and was nice enough to take a picture with us. After this his presence has become known to the entire place and we end up heading on to the next bar. Cool guy indeed though."
"Mind if I ask for recommendations? Is one of my favourite genres! I’ve got to try magic arena soon. Didn’t like runes of tarrabah or whatever it was called. Loved slay the spire up until a point, mix of two great genres."
"The channel is TeamFourStar. They also do the Dragonball movies and Hellsing Abridged. 

They just finished the Cell arc and it is glorious."
"You’re right, not obsolete, just not as good"
I was shocked when I found this out as a child.
Noticeably heavier ? Im really between these two. I guess i will return the flow if its to heavy
"Not a joke at all. If you get raw garlic into your blood stream as quick as possible it bumps up your immune system
Way quicker than putting it from pill form
Through your stomach. Don't put vitamin c pills
Up there. What??"
"Big fan of these:

"Wheatgrass.  

3 oz in a single shot.  With an orange slice chaser (no juice because the acidity breaks down the vitamins).

Best early in the morning.  Definitely on an empty stomach because that stuff is rough going down and will be rough going through your guts.  Also tastes like someone hit you with a grass-covered brick in the mouth."
"Kamal Hassan and mohanlal, for sure."
"I know it’s frozen- but bare with me:
A “Bushwacker”
Awesome drink I used to made all the time in the USVI. A cool 70 year old island guy I tended bar with was said to be one of the creators.
 This is one way to make it- there are many variances...

Equal parts
-Dark Rum
-Triple Sec
-Amaretto
-Baileys
-Kahlua
-Cream of Coconut
Blended with ice

I’ve seen people also throw in some 151 and vodka to make it stronger. Add peanut butter and you’ve got an alcoholic Reece’s drink."
"Am a dentist 

Really don’t care as long as it has fluoride and doesn’t achieve “whitening” through abrasive methods"
You're about to get a lot of replies about what a massive trophy the cup winners cup was.
"See the thing with Acqua Di Gio Profumo when I sprayed it on my skin coming from a retailer, I really liked the initial smell. I've thought of buying it on the spot but I decided to see how it performs for a day first. But after a few hours in, the smell kind of got invading that it started to get obnoxious for me, it felt like I was having a headache. But then again, I sampled a lot of perfumes that day, so maybe my nose got fucked up. Haha. Maybe I should try it on a decant first"
"Did maintenance at some hotels as pure grunt labor.

People will flush anything down a toilet.

Towels, sheets, giant shits that no human could have possibly downloaded, pillows, paper, food, bottles, and just abkut everything else.

Best one ever, got a call to snake a toilet in a room.  Twitchy Latin guy tells me it is *super* important I be careful to not damage said flushed item.  Gotcha.  I managed to fish out his bags of various powders and pills out without breaking a single bag open.  He offered me some product as a tip, and when I declined, just handed me a stack of $20s and ushered me out the door.  It was an $1,800 tip.

Oh, and ladies, tampons and pads do *NOT* get flushed down the toilet.

And for everyone else, flushable wipes, aren't."

Im planning on getting my B at SDSD and had my AFF done at Elsinore. SDSD is not a bad place for students/fun jumpers. Tandems are prioritized so you get very little notice to jump on loads. Message me if you still have questions
