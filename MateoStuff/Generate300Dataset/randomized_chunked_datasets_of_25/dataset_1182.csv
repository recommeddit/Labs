69009,"AFUtD is a great example of what I love in SF - just read it again recently.  It's more of a direct adventure story but it's a lot of fun. So hard to pick ""top 3"" because it varies with my mood.

Among the top ones, today, and which list will be different tomorrow:

1. A Fire Upon the Deep (per above)
2. Enders Game (just holds up well as a re-read)
3. Cryptonomicon (which has the density I crave, even though it's often more historical than futuristic).

Though I'd be tempted to include Dune as well but didn't want to copy your list.  Anthologies won't make the cut of course even though Dangerous Visions deserves to be in there.  Pynchon is maybe too literary but Gravity's Rainbow deserves a mention.",best science fiction novel

It's easier for them to get around the fiddliness for an exciting theme and that constant feeling of progress. Wheras dry, point-salady Euros can be VERY hit or miss (and I do love me some dry, point-salady Euros).

Beer, Pilsners are easy to drink and go well with fatty, savory foods like wings, BBQ, fries or bar snacks.

Wine, Riesling is a sweet to semi-dry white wine know for being pleasant and easy to drink. 

Since it's your 21st, I'd like to recommend tastings and tours of craft distilleries, breweries, wineries, etc if that's an option where you live. Distilleries generally serve unique cocktails if small servings of straight liquor isn't your thing. A brewery tasting lets you try a wide variety of beer styles, and the staff are often VERY knowledgeable and can help you find a beer that's right for you. Winery tours and tastings are more of a summer and fall thing, but they can also help you narrow down your wine palette so you know what styles to buy at the store.",best alcoholic drink

Since that park is gone, I'll go with Six Flags Fiesta Texas. It was the least Six Flags feeling park. It has personality and felt... cared for? Well aside from where Pandemonium is, that felt straight up Six Flags and kind of just placed without much thought.",best roller coaster at six flags
