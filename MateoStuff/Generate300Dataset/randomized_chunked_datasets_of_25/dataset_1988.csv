72644,best wireless lightweight mouse,were you able to palm claw the xm1? i currently own the model o and it feels way too narrow and flat for me. i get cramps on my pinky and ring finger if i game for really long. cant seem to palm the mouse as well. i have similar hand sizes 20x10. i am currently considering the model d and roccat kain 120. but your review has got me reconsidering the endgame xm1 even though ive been told that it would be too small for my grip style. i used to forcefully palm a kana which was like a fk2 clone so idk. fingertip clawed an office mouse in my early gaming days as well.

It's no 'worse' than having to install any other 3rd party lib, the bonus, however, is you get symmetry between front-end and back-end code."

14628,best romantic novel,"Suzanne Robinson. She was my favorite author for a long time. I recommend  [Lady Gallant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/646199.Lady_Gallant?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=1) nearly every time there is a grovel thread, and [Lady Dangerous](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1332493.Lady_Dangerous_The_English_Gunslingers_Duet_1_?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=3) when people are looking for an independent, level-headed heroine. I hesitate to actually recommend my third favorite, [Lady Hellfire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2851469-lady-hellfire?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=JPIANa1oi8&rank=5), because although I love it, it has what I consider to be a serious flaw in the story (the Hero has *way* too many kinds of trauma going on)."
