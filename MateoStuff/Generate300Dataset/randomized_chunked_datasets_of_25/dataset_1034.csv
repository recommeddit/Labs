59631,best perfume,"No clue on specifics here, but I bet you have a decent collection of niche. I would likely approve of your taste, even if I donâ€™t love all of the specific fragrances. But I would probably enjoy a lot of them. I definitely approve of career choice (maybe even envious if you do pathology!) Certainly takes a special character to do forensics ;)

A couple possibles: MDCI Chypre Palatin, Lalique Encre Noir, Tauer ACDDâ€¦.?"

31765,best hotel to live in,It's half way at the foot of the bed and on the floor.  It still makes a good feet warmer but I don't want to get too close to it.

17509,best iOS game,"Genshin Impact was double Google/Apple 2020 game of the year, king of PVE games globally in revenue and player base, cross play and save with PC and PS4.

There is simply nothing even close in production value.  Everything else looks like PS2 games in comparison.  They are so far ahead competitors can't even see their tail lights."

I recommend you check out the pax series of games as well, similar enough, but way better."
