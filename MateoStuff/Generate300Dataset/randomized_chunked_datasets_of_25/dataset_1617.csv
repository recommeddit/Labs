25528,best cricket teams of all time,"I knew his average was good, not that good!! He did bowl with arguably the best pace attack ever and that would've helped him. But there's about 10 pace bowlers who could make this team, of the top of my head. Hadlee, McGrath, Waqar Younis, Barnes, Steyn, Truemen"
22460,best celebrity,"Sylvester McCoy came through my line at Target once. I recognized his voice and just kept telling myself it wasn’t him. I couldn’t shake the feeling so I asked

“I know this sounds stupid but you sound like The Seventh Doctor.”

He answered coyly “The truth is ( he puffs up his chest) I am him.”

I totally geeked out and Davros (Terry Malloy) was with him. I never got a photo but hot damn we’re they just amazing people."

34197,best NFL player,"As long as he keeps the twitter meltdowns football related and isn't spouting anti-vax bs or calling Deshaun Watson's accusers liars, I don't have a problem with that."
14655,best romantic novel,"{The Flatshare by Beth O’Leary} for contemporary and {A Wicked Kind of Husband by Mia Vincy} for historical. I’m like a broken record around here for these two books.

It warms my heart to see an AJH mention and this much love in the wild. (I’m not part of a cult or anything, \*surreptitiously looks around\*, nope, not me)"
46338,best trick or treating candy,"Keep your outdoor lights on if you still have candy.  If you turn off all the outdoor lights, it indicates to the children that you are either out of candy or not giving out candy.

When children come to the door, they will knock or ring your door bell and say trick or treat when you open the door.  You can put as much candy as you like into each child's bag, but one is enough.  The children will be going to a lot of homes and will get lots of candy.  You don't need to give them more than one.

5-9PM would probably be a better time to wait up and you still might get teenage trick or treaters after that.  You might even get trick or treaters the day after Halloween as that is what I did when I was young.  Many people would stock up on candy but wouldn't be able to give it all out so I went to everyone's home the day after Halloween and asked them if they had any spare candy they wanted to get rid of.  Didn't even need a costume.

Unless you're doing some sort of active haunted house or something, do something near the entrance of your house (inside) that will keep you occupied but is ok to get interrupted with.  Watching kids walk around the neighborhood to each house is a lot like watching children walking around a mini-golf course.  One family will go up to a house and trick or treat and then a few minutes later another family will come along and do it.

If you don't have anything special to do, you can sit outside your house and give children candy as they pass by.

You should also get some ""bad"" candy.  Not candy that is poisoned or anything but candy that children really don't enjoy eating, like apples and oranges and fruits and grapes and crap that people don't consider as candy.  Some kids might come to your house not wearing a costume or saying they are ""an average American student, derp.""  Give these kids without costumes the bad candy or fruit.

If you enjoy the process of giving out candy on Halloween, stock up on King Size candy bars for next year.  Give each child that trick or treats at your house a king size Snickers or king size Reese's or king size Kit Kat.  The year after, everyone will realize you're the good home to trick or treat at and all the children will come to you.

If you are a registered (or closet) pedophile, you should probably just leave all your lights off and not participate in Halloween at all."
73262,best Linux distro,"""...do not suggest me any other distro...""
Mint and Ubuntu are based on Debian... Meaning you are not really considering any options at all."
62077,Best RPG game on PS4,"Sorry to be that guy but i think calling most of these (besides Skyrim and Fallout) games RPG's is really pushing it.


Imho the rest should much rather be called action adventure.


Anywho you already have some nice suggestions, if you want to try something different and more ""classic"" RPG-like, i would recommend Divinity Original Sin II"

61593,Best RPG game on PS4,"You are literally creating a custom character to play the role of a farmer in a small town. You level up, dungeon crawl, and select classes (trapper, farmer, artisan, etc.), you form NPC relationships, complete quests, and the overarching story is a hero quest to defeat a megacorporation from ruining your familial land inheritance.

Of course Stardew is an RPG."

58751,best cologne,"Don't worry, I think it is much better to experience frags based on your situation and use them dynamically. Using 1 frag for everything is like only having one outfit. It might be okay, but it isn't ideal for all situations.

Besides the world of frags is so vast, it makes no sense to only wear a single one."

71358,best movies with a cool twist,"This is not the same as eye contact, not even close. Dude literally walks everywhere without bumping into things or falling down. He fights groups of people. He goes into shops asking about items, picking up things he didn't put down without searching for them, and pretty every interaction he has, he behaves as if he has sight. Either God gave him sight and then took it away, which is fine here t poorly explained, or they did a very bad job trying to make this a twist."
3623,best college for research,"Many universities are in Paris and hence are not very visible on this map. Also, many of the top French students don’t go to university but to highly selective and smaller schools (Grandes Écoles). Although I don’t know how much this latter point matters since I believe that most research in France is still conducted within universities."
63831,best books for building better habits reddit,"Well, for me, it is not about changing bad habits. It is accepting bad habits as a part of you, and learning how to use your bad habits to your advantage. If you lose your devils, you might lose your angels too"
