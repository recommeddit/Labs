3588,best college for research,"I use the [AAU (American Association of Universities) membership](http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476) as a better proxy of what R1 used to mean. It's basically a subset of the RU/VH classification, and exclude some less research-reputable school."

46330,best trick or treating candy,"To indicate that you are candy-handing, make sure that your address light in the front yard is on. This is the universal sign for 'even though the house isn't made up, I've still got the goods.

There are two common approaches to candy-handing: the 'leave the bowl out and pretend kids are responsible' approach, and the 'let me see how scary you are!' approach.

In the first, you put all your candy in one large container outside of your front door, ignore your gut feeling that some jerk kid is going to take more than his fill, and go about your business. You can put a sign out that informs them not to take more than a couple pieces, but honestly, nobody regards those.

The second approach is a little more complicated, in that you actually deal out candy yourself. If you have a screen door, the best way to know that the kids are outside is to leave your door open, with the screen door closed, that way you can hear them and be ready before they get to the doorbell. The kids exclaim 'trick or treat!' and you hand out the candy. However, there are a couple of approaches to doing the actual hand-off, as well. You can:

* hold a big container out for them to select from, and let them know how many to take

OR

* drop/ throw pieces into their bags as they hold them open for you. If you choose this route and accidentally drop their candy on the ground, it is common courtesy to cry ""whoops!"", pick it up yourself, place it into their bags, and then hand them an extra piece or two for the inconvenience.

Most children will be trick-or-treating from the brink of sundown until about 8pm. If you run out of candy, don't worry about it, just be sure to turn off the light out front to avoid any confusion. TP'ing of houses is far less common than what's conveyed in the media; if you're nice and hand out decent candy, (which it looks like you are) you'll have nothing to worry about. Be sure to compliment kids' costumes, and tell them just how scary they are. Be ready to be extra gentle to the little kids who are more frightened of approaching you for candy than any Halloween ghoul they'll encounter.

NOTE: just because the kids yell 'trick-or-treat' doesn't mean you should take them up on it and suggest they perform a trick in exchange for candy. It puts the kids on the spot, and can be a good way to get yourself TP'd."

4970,best home improvement store,"I normally go to Lowes, but I might start going to Home Depot, even though I realize this may have happened at both. Lowes shows that they have fireplace screens available in store and the number and items increased in a few days. I ordered one because  the second we're not looking, my puppy is running and jumping into the fireplace and trying to eat the fire stones and fake gas wood. The outside of the fireplace has granite on the bottom, so if I use a baby gate and he knocks it over, it might damage the granite. If I use cardboard, he'll destroy it or just move it. 

So I ordered one online and selected pickup order. I get there, and ask who can help me, and they literally tell me they can't because it's a seasonal item. They also want $20 to ship it. 

I normally prefer to go to that Lowes, because if I go to the slightly farther away Home Depot, there's usually people out there begging for money."
68141,best science fiction novel,"I loved Antarctica. It's one of Robinson's early novels and besides the fact that it's a good book in its own right, it also features the seeds of the themes that Robinson would develop more fully in his later books. Namely: 

- (the impossibility of) reimagining/recreating society from scratch- Mars Trilogy

- politics of climate change/science- Science in the Capital Trilogy

- other things that I can't quite remember haha

(In particular, he is really talented at presenting a wide range of really believable perspectives.)"
