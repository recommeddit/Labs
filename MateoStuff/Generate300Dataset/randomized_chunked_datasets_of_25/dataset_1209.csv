53289,best usb c charging cable,"I don't know, but the weight shouldn't be an issue. The Powerline III fits nicely in a slip pocket of my bag, so I didn't want anything bigger."

58174,best cologne,Can't believe I had to scroll this far down to see this one. I've been wearing Cool Water for the last twenty years and still get compliments on it.
16333,best sunglasses for fashion,"I came across [these](http://imgur.com/a/3q36k) in an airport in Norway, from what I can see on the website, the style is called Round Metal, but they have this sexy dark blue rim around the lenses. Also they fold.

I think they look good on me, but I don't get an excuse to wear them a lot in this climate."

30207,best Mexican war to study,Really a side note. I‚Äôm in the northeast I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs taught differently in Texas. Fighting a war with superior weapons rather than with honor is an important theme though. It‚Äôs how we beat the British partly because if we stood in a line and fired at each other we would have lost

12604,best gifts for mom,"I am the mom of a slob. I pick my battles, and his room is not one of the them I choose to engage. He has to pick up after himself everywhere else in the house, but my only rules for his room are: must have a path from the door to the bed (fire safety), and NO FOOD in the room.

If he's lost something because the room is too dirty, Not My Problem. (If it's something critically important like his glucose meter that's lost, I charge a $5 finder's fee/take a favorite item that he can buy back from me later.) If he is embarrassed to bring friends into his room, Not My Problem."

26819,best board games,"It's a well known game in the board game community.   Top 100 will exclude a lot of games, no matter the list"
32921,best energy drink,"From someone who was actively traveling and playing videogames competitively I can tell you. I tried everything ranging from your standard Monster to online ordered extra caffeine pills(Much like Adderol). The best for pure mindset and focus, is always NOS. Standard blue is the best, but theyre all fine. I honestly dont get the focus with others. A monster or Bang gets me hype, but im just jittery and energetic im not pushing out that quality gameplay. While drinking NOS, I legit feel like I have the next few hours of pure concentration to win. Give it a try."

48267,best color to paint with,"I agree. *However*, it's interesting that ""they"" always say that painting a room is the least expensive way to freshen or redecorate a room. I just had 3 bids for repainting my LR/DR, a 30x15 area. I'm going with the company that bid $2600. This includes them moving furniture, but I'll be removing all small stuff and wall hangings."
20130,best workout music,"I put in my earbuds and hit play on *Run The Jewels 2*. As soon as I hear ""I'M GONNA BANG THIS BITCH THE FUCK OUT!"" I know it's gonna be a good session."
23161,best social networking site for CS,"An active social network can be a boon, but a bad social presence is much worse than no presence at all.

Assume they will Google you. Assume they will Google any relevant usernames and emails that they can find. You might be wrong, but for the effort it takes to sanitize your life, it's worth it.

Common Pitfalls:

1. Using the same username across many services. When someone google's my username, my reddit profile shows up first, but the rest of the top two pages have nothing to do with my real identity. Now imagine if you had the same username on your LiveJournal from your angsty years and your GitHub account from 2013.
2. Leaving your real life wide open. Keep your LinkedIn, Facebook, Google+ and MySpace accounts fairly shut down either by using them very little, or by locking down privacy options. You do not want Joe Average to be able to see you being drunk and disorderly. Or judging you based on your friends.
3. Being unprofessional. You can be doing everything ""right"" -- being active on GitHub, tweeting with the local startup community, asking and answering on Stack Overflow, blogging your little heart out -- but if your tone is unprofessional or your communication skills are lacking, you're doing more harm than good.

In the long run, I'd rather hire an employee with no social record than an employee with a bad one.

If you LIKE being a little eccentric, you can mitigate a lot of these risks by having a second persona tied to a username. For a perfect example, look at [_why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff), who chose to be larger than life and it allowed him to maintain a stable job as a professional and go be a cartoon character with the masses. 

However, a good social presence can help a lot in certain situations. Especially with start-ups."

35368,best alcoholic drink,Screwdriver or white Russian. I like girly vodka drinks that don't taste like alcohol. If I'm not going for a mixed drink I also enjoy apple cider.
