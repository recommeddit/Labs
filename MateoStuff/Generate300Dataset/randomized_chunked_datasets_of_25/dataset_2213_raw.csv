He is pretty good at that!  But I'm not sure if they let they let the whole 'innocent' side develop as well.  That is why I am giving it time before I pass final judgement.
And it is followed by examples of Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan.
Oh yes!
"As a father of a three month old son, I can't imagine this being nice for my wife.  I think this is the type of thing that mothers of multiple toddlers enjoy, getting away from the chaos.  But when you're breastfeeding a three month old, the chaos comes with you.  The coat sounds good however."

"Growing up here I now know I was spoiled. The museums are some of the world's best and free to boot! When I visited other museums later in my life I was so confused about why I had to pay to visit them. 

I will also second the Udvar-Hazy Air and Space Museum in Chantilly. It's so much better than the one by L'Enfant Plaza."

"Fucking autocorrect. Whatever, I'm leaving it so your post stays relevant."
"Nearly 20 years ago, I literally bumped into Mick Foley at Six Flags in NJ, I was walking backwards down the exit ramp from a ride, while talking to some friends, and he was being escorted up the exit ramp with his kids, to skip the line.

My dumbass never saw em coming, and I backed right up into him, dude was super cool about, he just caught me, gave me a pat on the back when I apologized and said ""no problem dude, have a nice day."", and then I realized who it was as he was walking away.... my jaw dropped and one of my buddies just looked at me and said, ""Did Mankind just tell you to have a nice day?"""

Hmmm what if you give out international candies like Pocky?

"Another couple of shows which are awesome but only have one season so far, so I wouldn't include them in 'binging' are Barry and Kidding."
I love chloe too! And love story too
"so did you loose it, or not?"
"Sorry, I'm not sure if this is on Netflix instant, but 12 Monkeys fits what you're looking for exactly. Open ended, weird timeline, etc."
"Is Tycho from Penny Arcade a celebrity? Fuck it, he is in my circles. So yeah. Him and his wife. Met them when they were in Munich a few years back and showed them around town a bit.

If you looked up awesome in the dictionary, do you know what you'd find? The definition of the word awesome. Which is what Tycho is."
Arguably the best phone for most people is the best phone you can buy. No one said it was the best phone period.
got and got-fetch.
I always loved how Colin is the only one going at the end. Thanks for finding the link!
"I want to say yes to every single show on here. Also if you can get a proxy extension, check out The Mentalist on Switzerland Netflix. The main character is extremely clever and witty."

"Oh! Navy is a 90gm spring. Box jade is a lighter spring, somewhere in the 60s. I have a lot of them with shaved stems, they're not the best for using but are fine for testing. Pm me your address and I can put one of each in the mail if you don't have them in a sampler."
See not The NY Times or WaPo. Wall Street journal as mentioned is a fairly good source.
