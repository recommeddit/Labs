I think prices at HD are a bit cheaper.
I can't help but laugh at the image of this.
"* Organic Basics SilverTech Tee (\~$70) - I'll concede, that's quite expensive for what is in essence just a basic black t-shirt, but that's pretty much all I wear year round anyways. odourless / crease resistant / pretty well insulated. I have about a week's supply and cycle through them.
* Klean Kanteen Insulated Bottle (\~$25) - Used roughly every day for 5-6 years, this kinda feels like a BIFL purchase at this point. given how well it has withstood a good amount of falls / bumps"

How will an i5 8600k and a 1060 I plan on overclocking do at 1080p 144hz
"Maybe, but this was on the train."
"I will be going back to apple soon after a 4 year experiment with android.

While not bifl, apple provides software and hardware support for it's handsets far longer than most Android phones.

There are two Android phones going the user replaceable components; fairphone and teracube with hopefully more to follow just so you are aware of alternatives.

Iphone 12 mini should be at a really good price once the 13 comes out in September supposedly.

The SE2 is probably the best option currently."
"Allow me to hitch onto this current thread to get a reply to my question.

How do you rate the [Deuter Giga](http://www.deuter.com/de_DE/rucksack-details.php?category=72&artnr=80419&title=Giga)? I've had one for just half a year now and the inner side of the staps is starting to fray a little, otherwise it looks fine. If it's likely to develop more defects with the years, I'd like to know about them.

I have searched the previous backpack threads, and Deuter has been mentioned four times, thrice without much details and neither time relating to this model."
yeah seeing that zero is pretty satisfying

"Thirded, many years ago my dentist told me that toothpaste is unnecessary for properly cleaning the teeth--what matters is the brushing motion.  Toothpaste is ""mostly for breath"".

I asked him what he thought of whitening toothpastes, and he said ""They have very good advertising."""

Lol Brown at #6 is a bold choice
"Armani Code
Acqua De Gio
Desert Eau De Toilette"
"Black panther is good but gimme Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier as the top 3."
Comparing HD and Lowe's to a dedicated supply house isn't fair. Of course the electrical supply place will be better for electrical stuff. But it's not a one stop shop.
"Mine only lasts for three weeks tops (household of two), and once the filter is no longer working, makes the water taste even worse then tap water!"
"Jo Malone, earl grey and grapefruit. They come as two separate fragrances and the idea is you mix them or use independently. Whenever I wear them I get complimented."
Because I was not serious and I found it funny.
I made smoked salmon ice cream earlier this week; 'twas damn good imho.
"If you have a LUSH in your area, my favourite scent is Breath of God. It's unisex, and the notes I particularly love are quite masculine. It starts off smelling really weird/bad, but when it warms to your skin maybe half an hour later it smells like sexy magic sexytimes. I use it myself, as I tend to prefer most masculine scents over feminine ones. But if I smelled it on a guy I'd definitely think it was sexy, and also points for going to LUSH."
"I’m using the iPhone 11. As much as I like it, the size is a little too big for me. Often have hard times reaching for the bottom left of the screen…"
Back in the late 90s gold was much cheaper at \~$270 an ounce.  With your math it's about $171 or $280 in today's money.
"I used to like Chuck, but after hearing this story I love Charles Barkley."
