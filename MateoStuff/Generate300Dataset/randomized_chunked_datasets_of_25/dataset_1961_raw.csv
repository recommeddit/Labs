"In this age of ""ask your doctor if medication blah blah blah is right for you"", I'm amazed that people aren't a bit more skeptical of product claims. About 15 years ago suddenly almost all toothpastes claimed to whiten your teeth and control tartar and reduce gingivitis and freshen your breath and fight decay, all in one tube. I'm a dentist and I'm sure there are studies supporting these claims, but remember that manufacturers will exaggerate even the slightest purported benefit, however small, to get you to buy their product. Drug manufacturers have no problem massaging the data on something like statins to make them appear more effective, so it isn't a stretch to think that some data massaging is going on with toothpastes. Toothpastes help, but the action of the bristles is much more significant. The whitening claims are largely nonsense. The product is diluted with water right off the bat and it simply isn't on your enamel for a long enough period to have a whitening effect. If you hold a gun to my head, I guess I can look up some supporting studies, since this is r/science, but dental studies about toothpastes (dentrifices) are mind numbingly boring and I can hardly bring myself to even do a search. Sorry."

"I have never really thought about this. 

1. Read dead redemption (360)

2. Halo 3 and then other halos (360)

3. Call of duty 4 and then the rest of  series (360)

4. Forza 3 and then the rest series (360)

5. Star Wars battle front 2 (xbox) 


I have been playing these series for a while so it is hard to pick my favorite. And I used to be a 360 only owner."
I wish the website had a pic of the purple!
Up by Vices and Spices? Sounds good. I’ll have to try it

"Wow, that's cool. What else do you recommend from that seller? I never thought about fragrances on etsy."
"Perfect, thank you!"
"No a Hadlee team had only Hadlee and Martin Crowe as world class (or in Hadlee's case, über world class) players. You're almost certainly correct about your team selection.

Sir Richard Hadlee was something else though. Definitely one of the greatest pacers of all time (top 5 in my book), and the best/smoothest action any fast bowler ever had along with Holding."

"You can get 3 of em for under 100, most of the time. We started off with one that is now named Bessie and it has a name because it's literally our most used, most loved pan even over the Allclad...and it now has a ton of friends, including pizza ""stones"" and bread pans and dutch ovens and griddles and stuff. We went cast iron crazy. And I love it."

"I use Rotring, although I'm not sure there's anything that makes them functionally better than other pencils. For me, it's more about the weight of them. There's some psychological benefit to them feeling like tools, but I could see how other people might find them cumbersome."
"Puffs suck. They have a tendency to leave behind fluff. Kleenex. Plain Kleenex. No softeners, moisturizer, medication. 

Just plain Kleenex."

Totally agree with you! Phenomenal acting & writting. I find that alot of British shows are more interesting..
