22300,best celebrity,"I met Jared Leto too! Although i didn't recognize him at the time because he had a pink mohawk. He was riding a bicycle and rode right up to me. We chatted, and he introduced himself like he was not super fine (""Nice to meet you, my name is jared!""). He even gave me free tickets to the show that night!"

27079,best board games,This list is so heavily weighted towards engine builders.  Games for people who don't like conflict.
45442,best gaming system,"Nintendo GameCube. It's small, portable has a screen, great library of games no online connection required, downloads or updates and has a handle.

Best console ever."
71135,best movies with a cool twist,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.
8083,best toothpaste,My left-front gum line is receding because I'm right handed. I guess I power brush the left and it's bad.

62736,Best Data Science textbook,"Not sure if this is too ""pop statistics"" for what you guys are looking for, but I'm currently reading *The Signal and the Noise* by Nate Silver and think it's a good starting point for people interested in using data effectively."
11866,best gifts for dad,"Well, I got my Dad a book about a topic we both like and I'm plastering it with sticky-notes so basically he can 'read' the book with me and then when we talk about it, it will be more fun."
30150,best Mexican war to study,"Yup. One thing I find interesting is slavery's role in the Texas Revolution is what people think slavery's role in the Civil War was. 

Texas would've revolted over violations of the Constitution of 1824 with or without slavery, though it was definitely a motivator for some. The Civil War doesn't happen without slavery at its core."
23847,best car racing video game,"It is as playable as CarX Drift Racing 2 on mobile, there are a lot more assist on mobile to make it play well on touchscreen. If you get a gamepad connected to your phone and play the game, it is very similar to what you get on the console build but self centering is weaker than mobile."
37148,best amusement park,"Hey, I know that was supposed to be mean. Don't be mean."

47449,best state to visit in the United States,Dry tortugas national park off key west coast.
41127,best instrument to play,"The suggestions for keyboards or guitar are good in that they both facilitate the learning of theory because of the way they are laid out.

Guitar is very rewarding because playing three simple, easy chords in rhythm and singing along can sound great, and you can learn this much in a day or two, though it may take some weeks to develop the requisite hand (forearm) strength and finger calluses to be able to play for long. From these simple beginnings, with which you can sound good soon, there is an infinite path to improvement in so many different directions.
Add a second guitar or bass player singing harmony, and two people can make quite an impressive sound.

The other way to go is to reach out and grab the instrument that calls to you. Maybe you've always been captivated by the sound of the cello, or the bassoon, or the accordion (another good one for theory), or pedal steel guitar (madness lies this way), or trombone, or vibraphone, or whatever. If you are in love with the sound of the instrument, you will practice and this is the only thing you must do.

It is most important to practice EVERY DAY. It is far better to practice 10 minutes every day than to practice an hour every 3 days. Because if you force yourself to practice that 10 minutes every day at least, you will find that you will end up playing far more than that.

It addition, whatever instrument you choose, you will benefit from also learning to play drums, especially trap set. Playing drums is more like dancing than it is like playing toned instruments. Having good rhythm is more important than playing exactly the right notes. People listening to you will always hear when your rhythm is messed up, but seldom notice an errant note. Learning drums helps your rhythm on all other instruments.

Africans say: If you can walk, you can dance. If you can talk, you can sing.

Good luck. Playing music is one of the most fun things I do."
11184,best backpack for college,Eastpak. They truly last for life. I bought mine in 2nd grade High School (Dutch system) and finished studying five years ago; it's still perfect. I guess it's 10 years old now or something.
68621,best science fiction novel,S.N.U.F.F. by Viktor Pelevin. It's like a combination of '1984' and maybe Elysium but with a Russian twist and a seriously poignant social critique. Awesome book
34139,best NFL player,You're right. Payton was number five. [Here's](http://top100.nfl.com/all-time-100) the official list.
57846,best cologne,I get quite a lot of compliments when I wear Blue Jean's man.
34220,best NFL player,"Yup, look at Allen, second in mvp voting let’s pretend he didn’t run for 421 yards and 8tds  to go with the 4500 yards and 37 passing tds. Slot him at 40… it’s laughable."
3773,best college for research,"If your friend is from the IITs or IISc, Bangalore, then he really may have a point. They're not in the ""top 10"" but are ranked quite high. This dude kvothe5688 has no idea what he's talking about. He's one of those all-too-common self-hating Indians who bitch about their country with absolutely unsubstantiated claims to sound cool. Pretty sure university ranking organisations have a much better idea than him about spotting ""fake research"", when they chose to rank 30 Indian universities in the top 1000."
39451,best web browser,torch has media grabber and opera has FREE vpn. Torch works like chrome
35750,best alcoholic drink,yeah- that.  Or a cement mixer.  The name of that one should give it away though...
33514,best electric car,"Anecdotal data, but in our ID.3 if you have the AC targeting 18C/65F on a warm sunny day then the power usage shows it drawing 1kw just to run that.

That is while stopped at a stop light so zero drive power usage.

Setting to a few degrees warmer can cut that to 0.2kw easily though, the usage is very non linear."
54169,best medicine for a cold,I miss this. I need it right now.
