The BP Paradox: If the popular opinion is that something is overrated, is it still overrated?"

73569,best battery bank,Sounds like either a battery shorted or the lithium batteries had their wrap penetrated. Neither are necessarily the fault of anker

44096,best items under $100,"I've made this mistake. Built my custom Desktop in Fall 2011, slapped a 60GB SSD as a last minute addition to the budget (~$1,000 originally) just to place the OS on. Everything was fine for awhile, but it just fits enough that each time I have an update that goes directly to [C:] with no way to specify my 2TB [E:] as the download location, I get all kinds of warnings about low disk space.

Little before Christmas I bought [PNY Optima SSD7SC240GOPT-RB 2.5"" 240GB SATA III Synchronous-Mode Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)] off Newegg and for Christmas received a second one. Now I just need some free time to learn how to clone my current drive and install the new SSD's (my buddy had free time one weekend and offered to put all the components together for me while I was out of town -- no idea how to hook this stuff up)."
