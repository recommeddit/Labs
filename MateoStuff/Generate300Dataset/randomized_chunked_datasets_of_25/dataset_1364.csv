22734,"When I was a kid, like 2 or 3, I often saw an old man at a grocery store with a small, white dog.  The man came up to me one day and handed me a basket.  He said I could walk the dog while filling up the basket with candy (which he then later paid for).  This became the routine whenever I saw that man at the grocery store.  Walk dog, get candy.

That man was Gene Wilder.  I got candy from Willy Wonka himself.",best celebrity

22758,"Ryan Gosling paid for my parking on Hollywood Blvd once.  We had parked in the same parking lot.  He was leaving and we were arriving and I struck up a convo with him real quick.  

He asked where I was from and why I was there/who I was with. (Spring Break, 9 friends, 2 cars).  And he was like ""Oh you guys have 40 bucks to drop on just parking? Must be loaded"" I chuckled and was about to say something back and he just says the coolest thing to me.

""Don't worry about parking today man, I'll cover you all for the weekend.  Have a fun spring break!""

It was so cool.  He is JUST as nice in real life as you think he would be.

Install 3, like you know you should. 

I use Nautilus when I run on systems with reasonable ram because everything just works. I am also too terrified by the idea of deleting Nautilus from Gnome to even try it. 

I use pcmanFM when I run on more limited systems.

37428,"The best amusement parks are the ones that aren't crowded

it doesn't matter how good the rides are or whether or not they have the latest and greatest rollercoasters.

If the park is relatively empty...you will have an exponentially better time than going to the uber crowded park with all the crazy rides

The most fun I ever had at an amusement park was at Silver Dollar City in Branson Missouri.  I was there with a group from school on a weekday when barely anyone was around.

We just stayed on the roller coasters for like 20+ rides in a row because there was nobody else in line

It was the best",best amusement park
