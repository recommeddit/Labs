11608,best gifts for dad,"I loved cross-stitching as a kid. I cross-stitched the word ""Dad"" along with flowers surrounding it and then I made a small, pink pillow out of it. He still keeps the pillow as decoration in his car."
15579,best tree for the garden,Can't and don't want to :). Thanks!
22734,best celebrity,"When I was a kid, like 2 or 3, I often saw an old man at a grocery store with a small, white dog.  The man came up to me one day and handed me a basket.  He said I could walk the dog while filling up the basket with candy (which he then later paid for).  This became the routine whenever I saw that man at the grocery store.  Walk dog, get candy.

That man was Gene Wilder.  I got candy from Willy Wonka himself."
18718,best YouTube video,Now I have to watch all of them again
22758,best celebrity,"Ryan Gosling paid for my parking on Hollywood Blvd once.  We had parked in the same parking lot.  He was leaving and we were arriving and I struck up a convo with him real quick.  

He asked where I was from and why I was there/who I was with. (Spring Break, 9 friends, 2 cars).  And he was like ""Oh you guys have 40 bucks to drop on just parking? Must be loaded"" I chuckled and was about to say something back and he just says the coolest thing to me.

""Don't worry about parking today man, I'll cover you all for the weekend.  Have a fun spring break!""

It was so cool.  He is JUST as nice in real life as you think he would be.

15097,best romantic novel,"I will confess that I bash romance novels all the time. 

That being said, I love Jane Austen novels. Sense and Sensibility is my favourite and if I ever have a daughter, I want to name her Elinor."
35198,best alcoholic drink,"Considering this is the one and only time I’ve been glad I live in a state where liquor has to be sold by liquor stores, and grocery stores can only do beer and wine. Thus, I’ve never seen Walmart brand vodka."

54424,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I’ve got the hien and zero. Do you think I’m missing out on much when it comes to the new otsu? I switch between the hien and zero depending on what game I’m playing, but it would be cool if the otsu is the perfect middle ground"
3487,best college for research,"This one has Forbes, albeit weighted less which slides Emory down. I also did one without Forbes which I didn't post (although I can, I guess), since they don't have a ranking this year, and seem to be less reliable. 

In the one without Forbes, Emory is 20, mainly because though UCLA is higher on US News and CMU is higher on WSJ, both are lower on average."
39143,best web browser,"I Use Firefox have been for years, in my opinion its allot better then Chrome or any chrome Clone.

Good thing about Firefox is it 100% open Source and always Updated they fix Security issues fast."

346,best terminal file manager reddit,"One file manager? What is this Windows? 

Install 3, like you know you should. 

I use Nautilus when I run on systems with reasonable ram because everything just works. I am also too terrified by the idea of deleting Nautilus from Gnome to even try it. 

I use pcmanFM when I run on more limited systems. 

And finally the terminal, because sometimes you need that.

Very easy."
579,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"Bullet proof leak protection is a feature of air vpn.

It's 100% safe and no way it will leak because it utilizes automatic firewall rules of windows firewall but don't use a third party firewall with it it needs the windows firewall. 

Ivacy is somewhat safe too

Pia's network lock failed me sometime sadly

Cyberghost got a great combo of network lock + app Guardian"
37428,best amusement park,"The best amusement parks are the ones that aren't crowded

it doesn't matter how good the rides are or whether or not they have the latest and greatest rollercoasters.

If the park is relatively empty...you will have an exponentially better time than going to the uber crowded park with all the crazy rides

The most fun I ever had at an amusement park was at Silver Dollar City in Branson Missouri.  I was there with a group from school on a weekday when barely anyone was around.

We just stayed on the roller coasters for like 20+ rides in a row because there was nobody else in line

It was the best"
