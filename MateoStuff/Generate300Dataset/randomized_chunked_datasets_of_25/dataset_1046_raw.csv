"America. It has its issues but you can literally live in any kind of climate or environment you want. There are jobs for nearly every profession and many of those professions are world class with tons of opportunity and growth. There are a lot of things to do here, and it's a great place to experience other cultures and customs without having to leave the country. It has its issues but I'd venture to say there is a pretty good reason why so many people came here and still continue to from all over the world."
"I tried Spiced Green Tea, it was a dud for me."
"It's fine, just trying to give others another option to check out besides Warby Parker. You can imagine the disappointment I felt when I tried on a classic pair of Wayfarers and that shit just rested on my cheeks. Doesn't help that I don't wear glasses either so I don't know how good glasses looked/felt. Idk why I got down votes but whatever. I guess some thought it sounded too ad like?"
You have fluoride in well water?
totally agree. I have been to Chicago a few times and never needed a car
I've ordered multiple pairs from Eyebuydirect and have been very satisfied with the quality.

"I’ll avoid ones frequently mentioned and stick to some lesser known favorites. Crashlands, Siralim 3, Book of Demons, Undead Horde, Coromon (TestFlight), and Monster Hunter Stories."
"At least it's consistent with his ideology.

For what it's worth."
"I didn't judge, I gave others the information necessary to judge"
"Depends. I think that there's one fairly sweet spot for iems around $50 (where the Meelec A151, VSD3s etc are significantly better than anything cheaper). Idk about the iems you mentioned. IMO the JVC FXD80 (for less than $70) is almost 90% as good as any of the iems you mentioned. And the westone um3x is definitely a solid step up worthy of the extra money from those iems. 

Dunno about headphones. Im about to buy my first pair of DT880 600 ohm in a day or two, glad to hear you think its the sweet spot. I do forsee it as my endgame for atleast the next 5-7 years. I'll upgrade amps and speakers in the mean while."
"Both ethical, and convenience with my chosen e-reader.  But I also understand that Litrpg lives and breathes on kindle unlimited, and going wide is considered a risky bet in the genre."

"> percussion [...] are easy to play

Depends on what percussion. It took me literally two weeks before I got a reliable single stroke out of the tablas."
I still stand by my statement that Nate Silver's statistics work should be suspect in that he hasn't been formally tested or subjected himself to such and I haven't seen evidence against that. I will say that I probably should have finished the book as it seems he clarifies statements about his own predictive ability which I thought he was adamantly certain of.

Online pizza company in Goleta is cheap and good .  Try it out.
Also a tip: most TSA approved keyed padlocks have an unshielded shackle so they can be opened by anything long and skinny. Just so you don’t think that TSA approved Padlock actually keeps your stuff safe.
No.  Stay away from it.  It’s way too abrasive for your teeth.  We hygienists hate cleaning black charcoal particulates out from under your gums!
I'm surprised no one has attempted such a stunt.
"It was ok for me. Had some weird pacing, and they seemed to just forget about the plotlines about his parents and finding Ben's killer halfway through. Enjoyable, but far from perfect."

">Question: If I do happen upon a paper I would like to share, is there any limitation I should keep in mind in terms of age? In other words, hypothetically, would it be appropriate to post a paper that is, let's say, a few years old?

As long as it's interesting and not universally known, I don't see why you couldn't share it. Even Einsein's papers would probably be interesting :)"
