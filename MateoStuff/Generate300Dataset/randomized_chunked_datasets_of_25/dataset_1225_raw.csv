"What kind of poncey pub does a wild leaf salad with pigeon and a hot pepper sauce. Pubs are for pies, toasties, and very occasionally on a sunday a roast. Does sound bloody delicious though!"
"Mmm, Hersheypark has a case too."
probably the Xbox if for both. if mostly for the kid get a switch
"Yeah, that’s another great one. I can see why it won the Oscar for Best Documentary that year."
Probably better for your lungs.
"Susan Mallery does somewhat fluffy contemporary romance with a sense of humor and light on the sex. Catherine Anderson is also fairly good.

"I don’t think anyone actually thinks these locks will stop someone truly motivated from stealing anything. 

They just prevent opportunistic thieves and prevent your bag from coming open and spilling everywhere if one of the pulls gets caught or snagged.

Kind of a poor LPT"

"It really is. Niagara Falls, NY is basically a run-down Rust Belt city with not much to do (other than walk around the state park... it's a great park, to be fair). 

The Canadian side has a bunch of really good restaurants, bars, casinos, etc. - and you can get way closer to the falls than you can on the other side. And the view of all 3 falls is a lot better from Ontario than New York."
"You should add the Ratchet & Clank series to PS2, I can't really speak about 1 and 2, but I loved 3 and Gladiator."
