I drove the Mt Washington Auto Road when I was up there a few years ago.  Just driving up that mountain was impressive... 80 degrees at the bottom and 40 at the top with awesome views along he way.  I’m sure hiking it would be even better but I had the children with me.
">Oh I see. What I meant by bottled waters was mostly spring and mineral waters as those are ones I’m familiar with.

Generally the include the actual source in small print on the back of the bottle. Even ones with 'spring' in the name often are just bottled from municipal water sources, so it's basically what you'd get turning on the tap if you lived in that city. Some of them use municipal water sources and then filter them further. Other's own their own wells or aquifers and either use the water as is or filter it further from there. 

> What are aquifers?

Basically underground lakes, like a big cave full of water. It might not be exactly a cave, but a lot of gaps between rocks but that's the basic idea. Fiji water comes from an aquifer, specifically an artesian aquifer. Artesian means the water is under pressure underground between rock layers instead of being part of the water table. Fiji claims they don't touch the water and just put in the bottles, so it's full of minerals which some people enjoy the taste of. 

>That’s interesting. So if pH is different throughout certain brands can that be an indication as to whether a water is purer or lesser? In the UK there’s certain regions that have hard-medium-soft water but I don’t know the entire basis of what that means.. Apparently hard water isn’t as good compared to soft for some reason.

I think you're not getting great answers to your question because you aren't being clear if you're asking about whether or not the water is healthier or if it's purer. Pure water would be water that doesn't have anything in it besides just hydrogen and oxygen. Most water isn't pure unless it's distilled or filtered using reverse osmosis, which most people don't like the taste of as they are used to their water having some flavor due to minerals like calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Some bottled brands like Dasani start with normal city water, use reverse osmosis to get pure water and then add minerals back to it to get a flavor that is consistent. 

Dasani didn't catch on in the UK because when they originally released it, it had too much bromate which was inadvertently added while they were adding the other minerals. It basically had a public relations flop afterwards and never caught on. 

Regarding pH, 7 is the value where things switch from being basic to acidic. With pH < 7 being acidic and with pH > 7 being basic. Drinking water is generally around 6.5-8.5 from what I've seen. So as long as it's in that general range, pH isn't really a concern. For reference, Diet Coke has a pH of 3.28, slightly less acidic than vinegar which is generally in the 2-3 range. Bleach is at the other end around 11. 

Hard vs Soft generally isn't a health concern. Hard water just contains more minerals which often make the water cloudy or cause appliances like water heaters to wear out more often. Obviously if the mineral making it hard is lead or arsenic that's an issue, but just hard or soft doesn't tell you much."
"I just bought a North Face Recon backpack. It's spacious, comfortable, lightweight, and is pretty nice looking. It gives off a rugged look like you mean serious business with your gear. 

The only thing is that it's $99, but it lasts forever. If you a slightly cheaper backpack with the same quality and more color choices check out the borealis backpack."

"Kim: Watching the show u can see she’s the most humble even though she comes off different in social media and I like that she tries to learn to do North’s hair and be more aware of race issues//her constant appropriation of black culture and using North as an excuse. That video her and Malika made admist the Jordyn drama turned me off of her, very childish for someone her age

Kourt: I love her sense of humor and style, she stays in her lane as far as race issues and doesn’t try to appropriate black culture like her sisters//she seems lazy and out of touch with the real world. Loves the lifestyle but doesn’t wanna put in work and acts the most entitled even though she does the least and is the least popular

Khloe: Used to love her, she always seemed the most down to earth.// that comment she made about Jordyn ruining her family pissed me off. Tries too hard with her style and copying black women

Kylie: I like that she’s been lowkey lately, seems like she’d be fun to chill with and a good friend//I don’t like that she copies and steals ideas fashion wise. Also don’t like how she always goes on and on about wanting to be normal when she knows she doesn’t, she tried too hard to seem relatable. That whole Forbes self made issue is a mess. I don’t like that she acts like she started kylie Cosmetics in a garage with a $20K loan or something. Shows she’s out of touch with reality, but it’s expected when you’re born into money. Just own and accept your privilege 

Kendall: pretty, nice style, minds her business. //Sane thing, she doesn’t realize how blessed she is for her modeling career to take off so quickly. Acts like she started from the bottom"

No need for it IMO. Like inverse_squared already wrote if someone wants to get into your luggage he will anyway. Put your valuable stuff in your carry-on luggage and everything should be fine.

I bought pura dór hand sanitizer gel 2 pack for 19.99 on amazon. When I received my package it gave me a website to leave a review and I would receive another free bottle of the same product. The free bottle should come on 3-4 weeks. The scent is strong (lemongrass) but it doesn’t bother me.

"The first half of Rogue One ranged from bad to average. Once the movie hit Scariff it was amazing.

I enjoyed Solo even with a couple of rough patches. I didn't have high hopes going in as I was worried it would screw over Han's development in the Original Trilogy."
