1.	**Original Vetiver**: clean and soapy vetiver, perfect spring and summer fragrance!
2.	**YSL LNDL**: ultimate date and summer night fragrance for me, loads of sweet-spicy cardamom and lavender.
3.	**Bleu de Chanel**: the most versatile fragrance and one of my first loves, EdP is my fav concentration.
4.	**Platinum Egoiste**: recently found this beauty, the best aromatic fougere I have smelled full of masculine barbershop goodness while still being modern!
5.	**Bois Dâ€™argent**: so simple yet complex, warm and soft but some of the best sillage I have ever experienced.
6.	**Memoirs of a Trespasser**: boozy and woodsy vanilla, I love this one. It sits almost like a second skin on me and lasts for days! 
7.	**Tuscan Leather**: this is what you wear to feel confident, smokey leather with a touch of raspberry to brighten it up, to die for!
8.	**Tobacco Vanille**: the best holiday fragrance ever, warm vanilla and spices all on top of dry tobacco, deliciously sexy.
9.	**Floris Santal**: this is a refined gentleman fragrance, it can be worn whenever, but definitely goes best with a suit. Nutmeg, lavender, and sandalwood are the main players on my skin!
10. **Happyland Signature**: half a spray is all you need to smell like a warm apple pie that is baked til golden brown. My favorite gourmand and reminds me of the holidays, perfect cold weather fragrance!",best perfume

Since there are many other languages that are used for Web development, and only looking at these two we only see 33% for PHP, I am quite confident in my assertion that PHP doesn't have 80% market share for custom development (which honestly is a ridiculous claim on its face).",best programming language for web development

5684,"Just freelance type jobs. I mean technically they are a company, but it's not like I've signed any papers or anything. 

Working with Wordpress is really just editing the theme's HTML/CSS/PHP/JS files, it's pretty basic as long you know those languages. If you know how to program, you can do the work. 

It's easiest to learn when someone actually gives you a job. If you got a wordpress job and someone said ""change x on this site""(which is what it generally is because there's usually a starting theme), I'm sure you could figure it out. It's just a bunch of googling until you start remembering everything. 

Keep working on your own test sites, and applying to jobs. Eventually someone will hire you, even if it's for not that much money. That's how you learn and get good reviews on freelance sites. It's really not too far out of reach. Even with your basic knowledge you know more than a lot of the people looking for employees.",best programming language for web development
