56858,"I really need help picking between 21.5 (22) inch and 24 inch monitors for my dual monitor + laptop setup (the laptop will most likely be used with the lid closed). In either case I would go with BenQ GW__80 monitors. I received the 24 inch model yesterday and while the monitor themselves are absolutely great I can't help but wonder if 24 inch dual monitors is a bit overkill. They take a large footprint on my Ikea Malm desk. Maybe getting arms or a stand would help? Anyway, because I'm so unsure, I also ordered the 22 inch model this morning.

What do you guys think? What has your experience been with dual monitors of various sizes? Keep in mind, my setup up until yesterday was a 17 inch laptop on a stand next to a 21.5 Samsung TV on a stand as well.",best desktop monitor

65829,"My parents covered my housing costs for college and I covered tuition via loans and scholarships. You might be able to do some similar cost splitting to make college more affordable for you. Taking a year or two at community colleges isn't a bad idea at all, especially if your kids aren't 100% certain what they want to do.

My living costs in college were about $1000/month and my tuition at Cal Poly was about $6k per year. It's still a pretty chunk of change, but if your kids go to a CSU and have a part time job, it might be affordable enough.",best college in california
3961,"I got a degree in Film; against the advice of most friends and family. After a year and a half of food service jobs I've been working in the film/TV industry for over 2 years now. Both casting for several notable TV series and movies (Warner Bros, HBO, NBC, CW) and working hands on on-set for several feature films and TV shows (Dark Knight Rises, Walter Mitty, Law and Order SVU, Girls, Amazing Spider-Man 2, etc) 

My only main issue is that I'm already jaded by the way the industry works as a whole. And it may be too late to find another industry to work in (would love to work in Video Games).",best online college
