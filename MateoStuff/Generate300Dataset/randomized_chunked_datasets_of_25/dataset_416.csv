73632,best battery bank,"Yep, 100W is the maximum specified by the standard but it looks like most chargers can't handle that."
44899,best items under $100,37 years old and never knew an electric kettle is not an every day item.
67560,axios alternatives reddit,I never understood the reason why this one was different from `node-fetch`.
26558,best board games,"Have not played desert, but Island, IMO, is very simple.  We usually play on an easier setting because games should be fun, but the rules are pretty simple and it loses replay as a result.  Would love to try desert because more mechanics are fun to me."
65774,best college in california,That's really unfortunate... I'll regularly do 2 hour drive day trips from LA on weekends just to get out to some wilderness haha
47639,best state to visit in the United States,"Tennessee really has three hot spots spread across the state between the smoky mountains, Nashville, and Memphis. I currently live in Memphis and it is *vastly* different than eastern Tennessee."

52200,best hiphop album,This is a good list
46779,best hand santizer brand,"It does, but it's a bitch to wipe with."
38523,best newspapers to read,"I read the Sun-Times every day until I moved out of my parents house, just no reason to subscribe to it anymore because of my job.

I work at a newspaper and I don't even read those things."
72366,best keyboard switches,"Haven't tried many switches, so far: 

Tactile - Kalih Pro Purple, I also really like Romer G despite the unanimous hatred for them in this community. The keycaps are dog shit so I don't use them anymore. 

Linear - Cherry Speed

Clicky - Kalih Box White. And I have to say these are my most favorite of all, although I still prefer a linear switch for gaming I rarely find myself switching keyboards anymore."
54911,best water filter,"Our standards for water mains in the US are terrible. There was a great post on it by a water engineer a year+ ago (I remember because I read it before moving). Basically we have to keep the water pressure really high to push out all the dirt getting in, and a lot of our sewer lines are at the same depth as water mains instead of much lower, so poop water can get in if the water pressure drops for any period of time."
50833,best rap album,I would feel comfortable saying it was my AOTY too. I don't understand why people weren't freaking out over it. It's seriously like a 9/10 or higher IMO.
62029,Best RPG game on PS4,This although loading times are terrible.
13414,best spreadsheet editor,"Excel for organizing things, keeping track of freezers, etc. 

R (or Python) for doing actual data work."
52656,best hiphop album,I think ASAP has good songs but I wouldn't say any of his ENTIRE albums are masterpieces there's always a few wack tracks IMO
27901,best breakfast foods,"Poached eggs on a bed of extra crisp hash browns and corned beef, topped with hollandaise. Ethiopian Harar coffee."
3381,best webcamera,"You are 100% right, that's why one of my first sentences were: ""if you have the money to spend, go for it. But a lot of people don't.""

I personaly, I have extremely limited money I can spend forwards my hobbies (jiu jitsu, gaming, audiophile). So, these $40 I saved up on the webcam, I was able to get a new headphone..."
52460,best hiphop album,"Might be a preference, but op doomsday is far from DOOM's best album. MM FOOD is easily his best solo, and born like this is underrated"
34893,best NFL player,"Can’t forget Derwin James too, really good safety class."
21865,best winnie the pooh comic,oh bother...
