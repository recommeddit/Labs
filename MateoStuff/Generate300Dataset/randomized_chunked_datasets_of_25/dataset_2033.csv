16669,"Lmao at the doves. 

We have bunnies around here too, though somewhat rare I will see them a few times a year. 

We had to live and let live with some wasps two years ago because we discovered the hive too late (would have been dangerous to tangle with it, where it was built). Luckily wasps all did in the winter so removed it around November.

41071,Probably piano. It's one of few I can think of that doesn't require skill to not sound bad playing a single note. Not to take away from it of course - its lack of expression makes great piano music even more impressive. But most other instruments you can expect to sound pretty terrible for a considerable period of time.,best instrument to play
47362,"I'm going to suggest my personal favorite city of Orlando, Florida. There are plenty of flights between England and Orlando. I'd just suggest staying away from International Drive as you'll find it full of British tourists so probably not too interesting for you. If you go downtown though you'll will probably have a great time. If you're a big NFL fan, you can drive a couple hours north to Jacksonville and see a Jaguars game (they're doing excellent this year and they're lead by Orlando area native Blake Bortles) for ice hockey, you could watch Orlando's own Solar Bears play at the Amway Center in downtown Orlando. The only downside from your point of view is that Orlando never really gets cold (maybe 40s (Fahrenheit) at the coldest) but as someone who lives in a cold state I'd call that a huge positive TBH.",best state to visit in the United States

15029,"Old fashioned, but I like Melissa Nathan, especially 'Persuading Annie'. I really dig Ilona Andrews (read every book)  and recently discovered Racheline Maltese and read her 'A Queen from the North', an alternate history take on Royal romance.

Beverly Jenkins writes historical romance with woc. I love her strong heroines.",best romantic novel
24331,"Most of the higher tier Ghiblies will probably make it. Wouldn't be surprised to see literally every Miyazaki. Every Kon film for sure with Perfect Blue very close to the top. What I'm really hoping to see is Mind Game and Patlabor 2 perform well. I see overwhelming critical praise for the latter in particular (and Satoshi Kon himself praised the former!) so I'm optimistic. Also interested to see how Yamada does given that she's newer. Liz probably won't make it because it came out in 2018 even though it deserves to, but everything else has a decent shot imo.",best anime
