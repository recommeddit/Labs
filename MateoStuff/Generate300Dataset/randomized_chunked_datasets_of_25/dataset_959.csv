Keep it in the fridge for a day or two (makes it better) to thaw, let it rise in a greased bowl on the counter, covered for 4-6 hours. They use '00 flour' which is what the great NY pizzerias use.

34949,"On paper, it's very strange when it happens. There's an established field of play, but players can impact that field of play while being outside of it. 

Even stranger is that on kick-off/punt plays if a defender goes out of bounds they have to quickly get back in bounds or they get a penalty. On offense, players that go out of bounds can't be the first to touch the ball (unless they were forced out by a defender I think). 

There's definitely something that doesn't feel right with it, but there's so many rules favoring the offense and that this is relatively rare that I think it's fine.",best NFL player
