Mbdtf I thought was great from front to back. Each song was very different but it still sounded good as a whole. I enjoyed all the instrumentals a lot even though I don't think kanye is generally the best lyricist by any means.",best rap album

33763,For me it's not about power. It's about the sound of the engine as it races to the red line. The light shaking of the car at idle and the increases in gs as the turbos kick in. There's so much more going on than just acceleration which is why you see so many people rave about slower cars like the miata and s2000.,best electric car

I don't really care for Menards, they seem overpriced...",best home improvement store
42934,"Definitely check out Evil Genius on Netflix and The Jinx on HBO. The latter was really crazy in that there was some follow-up craziness in real time as the show came out and as a result of what the show revealed, which was nuts to behold. Won't have the same impact now but the story itself is crazy.

Drama-wise, definitely check out Breaking Bad, The Sopranos and The Wire if you haven't already. All absolutely top notch TV. And by that I mean arguably the best of all time.",best detective show

32586,"I kinda agree with this. I don't know if I'll feel different for a honey moon, but currently my gf and I are really into going places and staying at someone's home/apartment rather than a hotel. Services like [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com) make it really safe, easy and cheap.

We recently finished a trip to Paris, somewhere I thought I'd never see. [This was our apartment view](http://i.imgur.com/1Yh0Wvp.jpg). It was really cool to live like a local, go down to the local cafés and order drinks and breakfast. By the end of the trip, this one cafe knew our orders.

I mean, it's cool to relax and shit, but honestly you pay so much money to get to a far off destination. Do you really want to spend it taking sterile tours and hiding in your hotel's beach front?",best vacation resort

Basically I fry some bacon, mix with two grated potatoes, small can of sweet corn, bunch of chives, two eggs, some cheddar and 1/4 cup flour then fry them. I top them with greek yoghurt mixed with garlic and it serves two to three people. Sooo delicious but it's unhealthy so I don't eat it often.",best breakfast foods
