Seriously. Get a camelbak and a brita.
"If both are the same distance, spend a day going to both and talking with the staff/managers. If one seems to have more knowledgeable or friendly people, go there. The product quality is about the same."

Do you have a sweet tooth? ^^[context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1EzkRpelY)
A water pick. An absolute gamechanger.
"I'd definitely include Early Jackie Chan Hong Kong films such as:

Police Story(s)

Armour of God

Drunken Master

etc.

Star Wars films.

LOTR

Natural Born Killers"
"My laziness to install anything else, actually...

Manjaro is working tirelessly on my machine since 2014 where I installed it just to test :D"
"Seems to me that would be more acceptable than a meaningless war that has lasted longer than a decade. If you get him out of Afghanistan and into the custody of a third party country, you have much better options than wasting the life of US soldiers and pushing the country further into debt by chasing him around the mountains."
"No offense, but you're probably using vim wrong if you're still typing \`:w\` to write a buffer. For example, in my config I have \`:w\` mapped to \`<leader>w\` in normal mode  (where I set my leader to be the space bar). I also have \`<esc>\` mapped to \`jk\` in insert mode. So to write a buffer from insert mode, I just type \`jk<space>w\`."

"Ah I'd forgotten all about Kahn Academy, I used those for my A-levels!

And I'm willing to try any podcast really :) I mainly want them just for information in addition to revising etc, because I've found learning audibly to be quite useful, so it'd be nice to have something to stick on when playing video games etc :p"
"SRK, Aamir Khan, Hrithik Roshan, John Abraham, and Shahid Kapoor"
But the weather there is pretty extreme in winter
"I think you can skip Jesus is King from Kanye

I'd also add The Eminem Show and The Chronic"
I like the smell of clean clothes on men.
"I'm at the point now where I look for certain specs in a shoe - weight, offset, type of support, amount of cushioning - so I usually will try out a few brands with the specifications I'm looking for and go with the one that feels the best in the store.  In my 8 year running career I've worn New Balance, Saucony, Asics, Adidas, Brooks, On, and Mizuno.  I don't really have a preference but I've taken a liking to certain models."
"Thank you for that suggestion. I have been thinking about the UK universities. I like the fact that it is easier to figure out if you will make it or not, because they are very clear on what they are seeking from an academic standpoint. 

The thing as you suggested though is that they also force you to specialize very early and the system is very different from the US system in terms of a well rounded liberal arts curriculum. 

Besides my Mom is kind of nervous to send me so far away :-) but they are also on the list for now!"
"""Now the trick here is to make it look like you've been jamming dicks into your eyes""

It makes me so happy that she called you a boob.
And you can eat it while you drive to work.  It really is the best thing ever

"pcs and laptops dont have good image processors, phones do have them, 3 in the sn888 and 6 in the ex 2100. Also good cameras costs much money, pc brands just cheap out or forget about them."
"My teeth look kinda stained though, and I brush and floss. Is there any way to whiten them without harming anything?"
