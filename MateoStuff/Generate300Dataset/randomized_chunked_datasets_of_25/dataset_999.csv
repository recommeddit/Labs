16629,"I love hamsters (But my partner doesn't :( ), amd yes; they aren't pets for kids.

They sleep when kids want to play, they play when kids want to sleep, and if you try and interrupt that cycle you get bitten. They're small and need to be treated with care, not as rough as little kids can be; if they're mistreated, they'll bite or run off and hide. They need to be regularly cleaned out and played with (During which time they may bite). They only live for a short time (After which they stop biting).

And, oh yeah, they bite.",best pet for toddlers

15066,"In my experience, the people who proudly and snobbishly look down on romance novels have never read a good romance novel. They're often the only places to find good queer rep. I don't read a tonne of it but I do love what I've read. 


I'm a big fan of Sarah Waters' books and I've been listening to The Magpie Lord by KJ Charles on audiobook (the whole series is fantastic). There is also this short story called The Cybernetic Tea Shop by Meredith Katz which I recommend constantly, I absolutely adore it and everyone needs it in their lives. It's short and there is no erotic element because they're both ace lesbians. 


Sidenote: I can't stand Call Me By Your Name, the age gap/paedophilia thing makes me super uncomfortable. There's too much of that in queer romances, those unhealthy power dynamics.",best romantic novel

37223,"I have seen plenty of complaints about the lack of a dark ride, and the general lack of indoor areas at Cedar Point.  The bathrooms are also from like the 60s or 70s, they clean them but they look extremely old.  Both topics which are brought up to management during Q&A events with enthusiasts annually.  But Cedar Point still has a decent flat ride collection it’s mostly older but they have a good number of them.

Cedar Point and Magic Mountain are only really in competition online, and for a handful of coaster enthusiasts.  SFMM’s main competition is Knott’s, and then Disney and Universal.",best amusement park

Good:
safe - never have fear for your safety or property ever.
small - everything is near to each other because its just a city.
infrastructure - everything everywhere is nice. nice roads, nice buildings, nice internet.


Bad:
Expensive - most expensive city in the world. Price of motor vehicles and housing, especially.
Culture - the average Singaporean has a unique.. culture. But I guess this takes some getting used to just like every other country.


Would I recommend?

If you're wealthy, you will have fun here. Money talks, and Singapore is a good listener.",best country to live in
