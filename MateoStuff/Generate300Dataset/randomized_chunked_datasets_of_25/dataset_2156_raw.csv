I'm just talking about the order you choose the colors...not the order you put stuff in the room.
"> Being in that piece of junk was way scarier than jumping.

That's just bonus motivation."
What about 2d platformers?
I find it surprising that I had to go this far down to find this song.

"[THIS] (http://i.imgur.com/kxrWjz6.jpg) is mine. Slick as shit. Allows you to move it anywhere, can point it upwards to avoid glare and only 8 euro in Ikea."
"I buy the Economist and read the Telegraph, Guardian and BBC news online, which I take as giving me a decent enough aggregate of current affairs independent of the bias that each paper and the beeb has.

We don't really have a single paper which is 'the best'. All have significant flaws and biases and anyone who tells you that one paper doesnt almost certainly is driven by that bias when considering objectivity."
"Im on my phone on these sites and most of them wont load properly, showing me errors or when i click to download it shows me i have to pay for the book."
"Ball sac kids who took APUSH, APLang, and APLit expecting ucla but get rejected from everywhere."
Can I use Chrome extensions with Brave?
The Sinner.. that's a hell of a show. Just started the third part today.
[Where The Hood At]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIeSGUK-Lyo) by DMX is also great
"Seeing it in theatres when it came out was really a jaw-dropping experience. I was a big fan of the MCU before CA:TWS and thought they were great superhero movies, but with this one it was a great superhero movie AND a great movie.

 I really liked CA:TFA and became a big Cap fan from that and from The Avengers, but TWS really dived into Cap's character more. And the fight scenes were phenomenal. I really liked how they were just regular people (albeit supersoldiers, former assassins, or former military) without magic powers fighting each other physically.

Plus I liked Bucky's character a lot in TFA, so seeing him come back in TWS with more complexity to his character was amazing. That reveal at the end of the highway fight scene absolutely floored me."

Can't believe no one's said these but Graduation or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye
Vouch. It's a must.
"Black walnut. Got it, thanks."
"Great list! I'm surprised that BattleCON didn't make it, Tom Vasel described it as one of the best games he's played. I absolutely love it and still haven't found a game that I actively crave playing."
"I really really love my [Cotopaxi Tasra](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/tasra-16-l-pack?variant=45530908234). It [zips in half](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0281/7544/products/tasra_cargo_interior_1200x.progressive.jpg?v=1526508257) instead of just from the top so you can open it on the go like a messenger bag, and it has a lot of organization! It doesnt have a ton of room for anything thats not flat and rectangular though (its not a big pocket like a traditional backpack)"
That is such a reliable middle order. Colly and Bell could always be relied upon to score at least 30-35 when they came in to bat. Good enough as long as KP & co did the rest
"Dentist here. Just to clear up the misconception that the alcohol on listerine is the antiseptic. It's used at low ~20% to dissolve the essential oils. Listerine is an essential oil mouthrinse. It's those that give the burning sensation. Just like menthol gives you a cooling sensation. You need a way higher alcohol percent to act as disinfectant, much higher than listerine has."
"It will work in both browser + node environments, it uses node-fetch under the hood for node and the native fetch for browsers."
"Take some dayquil during the day.
Take some nyquil during the night.
Don't complain and live your life normally!
It's just a cold."
"I've noticed that small to medium-sized businesses seem to go with PHP (Laravel/WordPress), but if you want to get into corporate web development, you can't go wrong with C# (.NET). I work with PHP/Laravel, but there were a lot of jobs in C# when I was looking around."
Uh. I have decided to keep applying old spice.
