24874,best spiderman actor,"I'm watching Homecoming now.  I agree, Tom Holland does it best.  

But the transition from cartoon to reality was done by Maguire."

62914,Best Data Science textbook,"I understand some people don't like it since it is fairly mathematically rigorous, but coming from an undergraduate math education, [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) was a great introduction to statistics and machine learning.

I found it pretty refreshing to have an introduction to data science that doesn't waste your time or worry about simplifying the math or ""hard parts"". If you can hack it, I definitely recommend it over the hundreds of tutorials and guides and online courses that may be quicker or easier but will never give you a truly thorough understanding of these topics.

In terms of learning Python, I recommend [Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Data Analysis](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/b/b3/Python_introduction-2016.pdf)
by Kevin Sheppard. It's very good for people who know how to program but want to learn how Python is used for data science."
65009,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Obviously low/medium/high price is subjective, but for high end stuff the list would be things like The Lark, Arigato, Toma, Loquita, Olio, etc."
43984,best items under $100,"Raspberry Pi, wifi dongle, SD card, two USB controllers = retrogaming station for NES/SNES and anything earlier. But no XBox/N64; the Pi is too slow for that."
6910,best iPhone,"It's *because* the 5c was supposed to replace the 5. Almost the same exact internals, just with a cheaper looking shell.

I always thought it had something to do with the easily chipped slate color on the iPhone 5, but obviously that can't be true because there was also a white color that didn't chip as easily. Another commenter above mentioned that Apple just didn't want to sell the same exact looking device for $100 cheaper than the latest and greatest that was the 5S, so they ripped the guts out of an iPhone 5 and stuck it in a colorful plastic shell.

Edit: Also, as far as I know, they discontinued the iPhone 5 after the 5c was released."

30509,best Mexican war to study,"A group of predominantly Irish and eastern Europe immigrants deserted from the U.S. army and joined Mexico. They had been treated poorly and discriminated against because they were Catholic. They saw themselves as having more in common with Mexico. They were known as the Saint Patrick's Battalion, and are celebrated in Mexico to this day."
5733,best programming language for web development,jQuery is not a framework

49625,best gaming monitor,"if you ever buy a non standard hz and hope it works, you scammed yourself. Sorry :("
3492,best college for research,"Georgetown >> USC/WashU/ND/UCLA though. Outcomes are not even close. Might as well be racing an f1 car @ k1 speeds lmao.

You may have an argument in the context of aggregate research output, but most ppl on r/a2c, if not all, are looking for an undergraduate experience. 

Gtown is easily t15 for undergrad, and my mind is set on that."
31107,best country to live in,"My boyfriend works for a tech company. He has 5 weeks of vacation per year, but he probably works more like 45-50 hours a week, and works less than many other techies we know. I always have less vacation than him, and we both have a significant commute. And even where he works, taking more than 2 weeks off at a time is sort of frowned upon, which is also very common in the U.S."
59710,best perfume,"My favorites are Narciso Rodriguez Pure Musc for a light fragrance and Zarkoparfum Pink Molecule for a fresh, airy fragrance (it has great longevity though). 

I am looking to expand my collection of lighter scents for spring and I am considering adding Son Venin Santal Super, Byredo Mojave Ghost or/and Creed Love In White."
51538,best iphone case,I like the feel of catalyst cases. Specially with the clear back

32800,best free online grammar checker,"You just described everything I hate about amateur content writing, and it makes me cringe."
70244,best major to study in college,"The real world is depressing. Look, I’m from the generation of students that asked point blank if a creative writing degree is fine and if we could still get a job. We were assured that yes, *critical thinking and communication skills are valuable everywhere* and nobody can write so everyone will want someone who can! Cut to: the vast majority of my generation is not working in their field, because of this bullshit. It’s an unhelpful lie that if you just “follow your path” everything will work out. If you come from money and have parents who can float you along long enough so you can spend a bunch of years after college writing and not having to support yourself, then yes, things generally work out just fine. If you don’t, you’re saddling yourself with tens of thousands of dollars of debt for a degree that won’t open any doors except maybe an administrative job (which takes any Bachelor’s usually) and that doesn’t even necessarily make you a better writer. It’s not cool that society saddles kids with this magical Horatio Alger shit that everything will work out even if your plan is bad and then refuses to help them when they end up in debt making $12/hour. And we should try to build a better safety net. In the mean time? It doesn’t help not to tell these kids the truth."
