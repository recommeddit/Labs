62914,"I understand some people don't like it since it is fairly mathematically rigorous, but coming from an undergraduate math education, [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) was a great introduction to statistics and machine learning.

I found it pretty refreshing to have an introduction to data science that doesn't waste your time or worry about simplifying the math or ""hard parts"". If you can hack it, I definitely recommend it over the hundreds of tutorials and guides and online courses that may be quicker or easier but will never give you a truly thorough understanding of these topics.

In terms of learning Python, I recommend [Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Data Analysis](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/b/b3/Python_introduction-2016.pdf)
by Kevin Sheppard. It's very good for people who know how to program but want to learn how Python is used for data science.",Best Data Science textbook

6910,"It's *because* the 5c was supposed to replace the 5. Almost the same exact internals, just with a cheaper looking shell.

I always thought it had something to do with the easily chipped slate color on the iPhone 5, but obviously that can't be true because there was also a white color that didn't chip as easily. Another commenter above mentioned that Apple just didn't want to sell the same exact looking device for $100 cheaper than the latest and greatest that was the 5S, so they ripped the guts out of an iPhone 5 and stuck it in a colorful plastic shell.

Edit: Also, as far as I know, they discontinued the iPhone 5 after the 5c was released.",best iPhone

70244,"The real world is depressing. Look, I’m from the generation of students that asked point blank if a creative writing degree is fine and if we could still get a job. We were assured that yes, *critical thinking and communication skills are valuable everywhere* and nobody can write so everyone will want someone who can! Cut to: the vast majority of my generation is not working in their field, because of this bullshit. It’s an unhelpful lie that if you just “follow your path” everything will work out. If you come from money and have parents who can float you along long enough so you can spend a bunch of years after college writing and not having to support yourself, then yes, things generally work out just fine. If you don’t, you’re saddling yourself with tens of thousands of dollars of debt for a degree that won’t open any doors except maybe an administrative job (which takes any Bachelor’s usually) and that doesn’t even necessarily make you a better writer. It’s not cool that society saddles kids with this magical Horatio Alger shit that everything will work out even if your plan is bad and then refuses to help them when they end up in debt making $12/hour. And we should try to build a better safety net. In the mean time? It doesn’t help not to tell these kids the truth.",best major to study in college
