I truly have so many more than 5 that are on my ""will reread any time"" favorites list! But if I had to choose, it would be these guys. Not in any real order."
7247,best iPhone,"Also
- U1 chip (for details Find My devices)
- Qualcomm vs intel Modem chipset |edited
- Main camera^(2 vs 1), better Portrait mode and Night vision"
4652,best text editor,"Depends what you mean with ""similar features"". MS maintains [a list](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/) of editors that support LSP and it has several open source editors on it like kate or atom. (On a completely unrelated note...WTF is [MS paint IDE](https://ms-paint-i.de/). At the moment trying to figure out if satire or meant serious)"
47235,best state to visit in the United States,"Detroit isn't as dangerous as some people say, it's got some good bars and restaurants and a pretty great art museum. All kinds of strange flowers germinating in the rubble.

It's a little bit like Greece in that the primary attraction is visting the many lovely ruins. Also, it is bankrupt and negotiating terms with some Germans."
21811,best winnie the pooh comic,Delightfully devilish Winnie
11444,best gifts for dad,"Thank you guys for your kind words, helped me start my day off pretty awesome :-)"
48070,best color to paint with,"I fully admit that. I've never denied being a shitty person! I tried to kill myself last year. Don't fucking tell me how fucking shitty you think I am because I already fucking know how fucking shitty and worthless I am, ok? Go eat a bag of dicks and rot in hell.

Also, they're just fucking imaginary internet points. Get the fuck over it.

And yes, psychology IS a science."
25227,best spiderman actor,"Tom, definitely. But I liked Garfield's a lot as well."
70220,best major to study in college,"I think that getting an English degree was perfect for me. I told myself in high school that I wanted to get an English degree, become a teacher, and write. I've done the first, start the second next month, and have been writing for some time. Even if I never publish anything worthwhile, I have enough left over at the end of the month to maintain my bicycle and buy the odd bit of camera gear. I live pretty frugally, besides. Plus I get summers and all holidays off... Plenty of time with family... That's something that money will never be able to buy me when they're all dead or when I'm dead. 

I know people that have gotten ""good"" degrees (according to this article anyway) and who are absolutely miserable and have to be locked into that cycle of misery to maintain their lifestyle. They get excited with the paychecks and get 2500/mth apartments and new cars and live for their two weeks vacation. Their argument is that they'll have a good retirement. My argument is that I can go to school again, get a Master's then a Professional cert, keep doing what I'm doing, and my retirement will be just as good as theirs. 

It's a shame that people of my generation (twenties) still get suckered into the notion that it's better to work hard and be happier in old age, when your body is failing on you; if the stress of working or some cancer hasn't killed you yet."
39884,best Chrome extensions,Just wait until an update rolls out and it starts mining coins on peoples computers
19899,best workout music,Saul Williams - List of Demands
54100,best medicine for a cold,>keeps ~~people~~ *vampires* a nice distance away
51984,best iphone case,"Returning the apple silicone case not a fan, currently using Spigen clear until the mous limitless 4.0 arrives!"
35074,best NFL player,That's enough. Go take a lap.
31031,best country to live in,Not sure where you get your information but only NZ citizens or residents can legally work as sex workers. It cannot be used as a basis for gaining a visa.
16223,best sunglasses for fashion,DHGate ray bans
46409,best trick or treating candy,Heh. Her costume was super tiny. I doubt it. Rather chilly evening
29045,best calendar tool,"The ability to manage and see your reminders in Fantastical is really handy.
Furthermore it has a great monthly view without missing the Agenda function.

But there are some downsides too. I don't like their maps integration and search and depending on how many appointments you have daily, it might feel a little bit overwhelmed.

It is for sure one of the best calendar clients but like another user mentioned, I would never pay for the desktop version because it is too expensive. After all it is a calendar app.

If you are looking for a great alternative Google calendar is really solid and it is working with iCloud calendars too."
65350,best phone service company,">LTE Discovery to see the bands (they've added 5g recently), network signal guru and QCT Modem Capabilities to force bands.

Still might not be working properly

>I stop forcing any bands and I can see how it automatically switches to B2 and B66 to get to 5g.

B2 and B66 is 4G. If they were 5G they would be n2 and n66 also they both couldn't be 5G at the same time as the only devices that can do carrier aggregation within 5G bands are the new S21 models

Also does the unlocked Pixel 4a 5G have the software update to enable Nationwide 5G yet?"
32170,best hotel to live in,"Marco Polo Ortigas in Manila, Philippines. The pillows were exquisite."
33299,best electric car,They had over a year with the Bronco and the release has been a disaster
42902,best detective show,do you have hbo? hbo is the king of drama and true crime series
30727,best country to live in,"Okay, but these things indicate that things are on average better for more people in the higher rated countries."
26189,best politician,"Eugene Debs, an incredibly influential figure in the American left and labour history. He ran for president from a prison cell, as his defiant labour activism often had put him in odds with the state. 

Frederick Douglas, arguably the most influential black s statesman, long preceding MILK and other prominent black rights activist. He was a strong early proponent of black, women, and immigrant rights.

As a Canadian, I have to say Tommy Douglas. Socialist politician and hugely influential labour activist who brought forth our national healthcare service."
23322,best car racing video game,The Hot Wheels pack for FH3 completely killed off the last bit of my interest in ever going back for GTA racing.
