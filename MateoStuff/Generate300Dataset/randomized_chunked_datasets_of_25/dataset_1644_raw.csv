"The performance of the CPUs in Anandtech's ""best X for Y"" lists is based off their own benchmarks and reviews, which go pretty in-depth and can be found elsewhere on the site. They don't bother summarizing them for the monthly lists, and instead focus on the things that actually change from month to month: price and availability."
