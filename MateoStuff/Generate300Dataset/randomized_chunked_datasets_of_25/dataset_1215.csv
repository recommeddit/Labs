70420,best major to study in college,"Accounting. Want to own a business? Congrats you now can handle the book work and understand taxes along with business concepts. Want to work with the public and travel, congrats as well! Want to stay private and have an 8-5, congrats you can work in a corporate setting!

Many other benefits but Accounting is a very useful degree."

&#x200B;

With Prime Day sales going on, I really need some input choosing between:

&#x200B;

LG 27GL83A-B

ASUS TUF VG27AQ

Gigabyte M27Q

&#x200B;

afaik they are all G-Sync compatible (which is a criteria) and are similar but I wanted to see what others had to say that might make one edge over the other whether it be looks, space occupation, personal experiences with monitor, etc. Thanks!"
52244,best hiphop album,"If you want the definitive sound of the 90s and early 2000s here you go. I ranked them mostly based on listens but left a lot out since I overplayed so many albums in the 90s and 2000s (Wu-tang forever for example)

44574,best items under $100,Swimming goggles with a prescription degree. It really is life changing after swimming blindly for so many years.
34903,best NFL player,"Also led the league in passing yards and yards per attempt, and threw in 450 rushing yards with 3 TDs

I dont think he would've gotten it over Rodgers even if the team had made the playoffs, but he would've been in the discussion"
33725,best electric car,">I don't know if electric will get replace things like delivery vans or pickups used to haul

I think those will probably be the fastest to electrify once options are available in those segments. There's zero reason USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL are not using BEVs today since they have known, fixed routes and known, fixed overnight parking places on company-owned property where chargers can be installed. 

There aren't enough EV vans on the market yet, there's no EV Sprinter or Transit that they can buy if they wanted to."
16881,best pet for toddlers,"Well yes, you can say that about just about anything. 

The real response I wanted to give to this post was 'Don't get a pet. They are more trouble than they are worth' but I thought I'd try and be nice and helpful. Will go with gut next time."
57183,best water brand,"I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. Everyone knows that water itself is basically free. People pay for the convenience of having a bottle. If the bottle costs them 5 cents and they sell it to me for 12 cents, that's not a massively bad deal. 

If you want to convince people to stop drinking bottled water, lying about it being a bad deal economically isn't the way to do it. 

>bottled water may be taken from places that will miss that water.

So does tap water in some places. That might be a justification to avoid one specific brand, although I can't think of any that bottle water in places where water is scarce, but it's not a reason to avoid bottled water itself."

16035,best sunglasses for fashion,"I wear these:

[Celine Shadow](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ce/9b/46/ce9b46d54877e0349ea9aabb1c7e9fa5.jpg) with black and tortoise frames 

[Maui Jim Mavericks](https://www.mauijim.com/en/shop/sunglasses/aviators/mavericks) with silver frame and blue mirror polarized lenses

And my [Dita Supa Dupas](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/1f/81/b7/1f81b7f0a4a4cf76d7be063ae77568f0.jpg) in black will always have a place in my heart 

In terms of shape, I prefer oversized (can you tell?) and not too boxy but not too round. Otherwise it just depends on my mood but I'm usually not an aviators person and my Maui Jims are the exception. Traditional wayfarers don't really suit my face so I avoid them. I really don't care at all about sunglasses trends and wear whatever makes me feel awesome."
55899,best action and adventure movie,"The sequences from the beginning of the Sahara, through Sicily (excluding the fight scene) and then the boat ride out to the Abyss felt like an honest to god adventure movie. Think those were my favourite parts of the film."

35797,best alcoholic drink,"I love both of these drinks, and I *especially* love the combination.

My preferred recipe is:

2oz Disaronno, 1 oz lemon juice, 1 oz simple syrup, 1 oz bourbon, just a pinch of salt.

It's so good."
34110,best NFL player,My vote goes for Joe Montana.
8246,best toothpaste,"It's getting harder to find.  I think Trident used to have more when I was younger, but a lot of the brands seem to have increased the sorbitol and may have a token bit of xylitol just for labeling.   There are a lot of good options on Amazon though.  Spry's berry mints are great."
