I don't know maybe you got sick a bunch which made your immune system adapt and get better at fighting infections
More than twelve I've heard
"""You are Carol, right?""

""I used to be; I can't remember anymore"""
Lots of good recommendations here. Also wanted to add chris rock tambourine and Chelsea peretti's standup it's low key super amazing and avant garde.
Iâ€™ve been wearing their mahogany one for prob 4-5 years and love it too
I have that one and the sport version. Both smell amazing.

20 comments so far but none from actual dentists wtf
As usual : )
Those generous UC pensions aren't going to pay for themselves.
"Thy Art, Shadow of Intent, Filth, Children of Bodom, Hatebreed, Pantera."
Doggystyle > Chronic though imo. But yes 2001 is GOAT production
"Urgh I love the JR ward novels. I haven't read the latest ones though, just the main brothers (so first 6 I think) Are the later ones still good?"
Haha the dryness of this comment is gold. Thanks for the laugh mate
"60Hz, I have seen no input lag or image degradation over the year I have had them either"
Can you elaborate more which ones you use?
"Maybe it's recency bias. I think all the samples on the album are beautifully mixed, you've got catchy songs like Father Stretch pt.1, soul in Ultralight Beam, and in general it's unique compared to his other albums. I can get how people would dislike it though"
Oh man this is awesome ha ha. I might have to try this once in my life. :)
"Need For Speed Most Wanted/Carbon/Underground. Pretty old game YES, but to my knowledge we never got better after those.

EDIT: Had many reply, thanks guys ! I will take a look at NFS Heat, but I want to point out at people who still play the old NFS to use VSR/DSR (Virtual Super Resolution AMD GPU/ Dynamic Super Resolution NVIDIA GPU).

VSR/DSR will make your GPU render the game at higher resolution (2K/4k/6k), then downscale to your screen resolution. This will improve the look of the game, sharpness with low impact on your GPU. (deactivate all Anti Aliasing when using this)"
"I spent a buck on a back scratcher.  I don't know how I lived without one.  Best purchase I ever made!  Sometimes, it's the little things."
I want to see you work out for me!
"What do I think? Murder, mostly."
"Fuck, the year *is* half over, isn't it?

I think it might be Praty for Haiti for me"
So my sister's bestie brother is a producer and KUWTK was one of his first shows post graduation(he is listed in the credits) and out of all of complaints he had it always came back to Khloe just being super loud and bossy and annoying.
Mint and Airtable are useful too for budgets.
