"Sindre Sorhus... This guy is everywhere!

Most of his packages I've used are really good, I'm giving this one a try, thank you!"
Huh never seen that before. What device are you on? Im assuming its not the first iPhone
"Oh boi, classical guitarists are gonna get triggered reading the first few paragraphs"
Hmm I may actually get that one. I have a $40 Amazon gift card and that one is on sale quite a bit. I’m not sure what I’m gonna do.
Whatever you can play well.  Women are not impressed by an instrument - they're impressed by skill.
"Firefox, but using edge by chromium. Edge can be the best I think."
So just drink 2x? So u have about 320mg caffeine and after that one espresso or before haha Sry but i think my heart would explode... I couldn't think clear anymore after that content of caffeine.. Good luck :)
"Denver and the surrounding areas are also great. I can't think of the town that the Red Rocks park is in, but it is beautiful, and it is right next to the mountains"
"Need For Speed: Underground 2 gives you an amazing sense of progression and customization.
You start out with a choice between incredibly basic set of cars, which you can keep upgrading or you can buy a newer, better car then upgrade. Repeat the loop until endgame."
"Is the rest of the series worth reading? I just finished Dune, and I while I enjoyed it, I really hated how it got more and more in magic/chosen one stuff."
"I've read a lot of Knoxville stories and pretty much since his daughter was born he became the man he is now. Just a genuinely nice guy. He also tries to be a role model and took roles in movies that are ""cleaner"" than his jackass days, and even his roles in jackass are a little less raunchy. Probably hurting himself though, that really changed him. He can only urinate through a cathedar because of an injury during jackass. I think he learned a valuable lesson. But what I really get from him is that he uses his fame for good."
"You just gave me childhood flashbacks of those god-awful taffy atrocities in the black and orange wrappers. I swear it was only old people that gave them out too. Barf. 

With you all the way on Almond joys!"
Same as with any brand stuff. I think most of the hate for luxottica comes from them not being an american company.
"not an item but a turtle. i have had mine since he was a baby and he will look at me when i say his name, hand feed, and when i play with him he will walk to me. him and my other one both do this. there names are hulk and thor, hulk is a yellow bellied slider and thor is a Cumberland slider

"This is a tough one because there are so many. I think I would go in no particular order:

Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy

Ender’s Game

Dune"
"I've made an autoclicker and password manager on Java, and right now working on a startup manager with C#. I haven't done anything regarding databases, I assume that's gonna be necessary as well?"
"I feel like the term ""inspirational"" is a bit soft Nolan straight up steals from the movie."
UC was amazing. It took me a long time to watch it on Netflix when it was on their so worth it.
"Dope! I really like Art Deco and modern, post modern type stuffs. The structure is a 1962 compact ranch style brick build & I wanted to keep the idea. Should I ever find myself aboard such a vessel, I'd call it home."
"I’ve owned the ASUS VG27AQ for around 6 months now and it’s been a dream to play on, I highly recommend it if you’re looking for a 1440p monitor with a high refresh rate."
"My dude, mint choco chip is where it's at! Coffee chip is also good!"
You can still get it but it's a hassle.
Little Caesar’s on Milpas obviously
"I follow a crime scene cleaning company on YouTube (it’s very gross but super fascinating) and I think it depends how long the person(s) have been dead for. The more dead/decomposed you are, the more you’re going to leak (sorry) through the surface you’ve died on. Often they have to dismantle mattresses, box springs, take up carpet, etc. They destroy anything with biohazardous material on it, essentially. But it’s hard to say what hotels would do lol. Especially ones that are stingy with budget. God knows.

[here’s the YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/CrimeSceneCleaning) don’t watch if you have a weak stomach. They’re always pretty respectful, they help people with hoarding problems too, which is nice."
Shashi Kapoor. He was damn handsome and good actor.
