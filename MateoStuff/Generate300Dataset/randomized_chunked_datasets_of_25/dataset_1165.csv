26098,"I suppose part of it depends on what you mean by ""respected.""  I think a lot of people have it in their heads that a politician has to agree with them 100% on everything, or else he's a hack/sellout/traitor/etc.  And while, yes, there are issues that I consider make-or-break deals just as everyone else does, I think people need to recognize that you're never going to agree with your elected officials on every point.  You gotta figure out which issues really matter to you, and realize a lot of the little stuff doesn't matter so much.

When I was living in Minnesota (I moved this summer) I was honestly proud to have Al Franken as my Senator.  I agreed with him on a whole bunch of things, only disagreed with him on minor ones, and in general, every time I heard him talk on CSpan or whatever, he wasn't just saying things I agreed with, but things no one else was saying.  And that's what really made me respect him, that as a junior senator he was willing to stand up and speak his mind against things the political establishment favored.  (Him chewing the fuck out of BP's officials in the Senate hearings, while almost everyone else was playing softball, was one of his highlights.)

Plus, his bipartisan friendship with Rand Paul is pretty cool.  It gives me a little hope that maybe our parties could actually talk things out, if enough people quit just doing what their political machines tell them to.  

So, uh, pretty much I just want someone with intelligence, integrity, a cooperative spirit, and maybe a bit of a sense of humor.  Shame that's in such short supply in Washington.",best politician
