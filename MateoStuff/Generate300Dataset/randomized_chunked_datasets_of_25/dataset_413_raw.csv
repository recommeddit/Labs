"I have been wanting to try this small batch Tonic from this company.  Cane Sugar used.[Jack Rudy Cocktail Co](http://jackrudycocktailco.com/purchase/mixers/small-batch-tonic/)

Heard about them on Alton Brown's podcast [AB Podcast #38](http://www.nerdist.com/pepisode/the-alton-browncast-38-brooks-reitz-jack-rudy-cocktail-co/)"
"I know nothing about symphonic/classical percussion, so I do wonder how hard the repertoire is  for that as compared to other styles/genres of drumming. I guess in the symphonic world, I think of people playing a single percussion instrument more than a kit of multiple things at once. And there’s less syncopation than you would generally have for jazz, funk, or Latin percussion. So I wonder if the real difficult percussion stuff is found outside of the orchestra world.

I could be way off base, of course. It’s just that the first image that comes to mind of a percussionist in a symphonic orchestra is someone banging a gong, and that can’t be *too* hard."

Very cool list. I've been meaning to get really into Gundam. Currently only 2 episodes into Zeta. Btw  i thought the TTGL movies were just glorified recaps. Is the second one really that great?
Make RockApp great again
"For sure it makes tap water more drinkable, but don't really think it makes it safer. Tap water tastes like old pipes. Britta filters make water taste smoother, which is good enough for me."
"Carlos Santana. Met him one on one when he was touring for the Supernatural album. Extremely nice man. Signed one of my guitars, even played it a little afterward and complimented me on it. I retired the guitar for fear of wearing off the signature."
I've had mine for a few months now. I'm a fan.
"Good god, a whole month? Thnx for the dedication. Napoli? That sounds pretty Italian."

"True, but that wasn't the question."
Dental student. Just please brush with fluoride paste and floss. The majority of problems are cause by lack of oral hygiene.
"Hey, that's my monitor! :) although it's an awesome monitor for its price, there's one issue I have with it: the damn thing wobbles quite a bit. The monitor mounts onto the base across a very small surface area, so any bump on the desk will make the monitor wobble a bit. 

Although it's not a deal breaker at all, it's enough to be considered, IMO."
"Yes, I would go for Pitaka MagEZ. It also supports MagSafe."
"Grilled Pineapple Mojito--Malibu, grilled pineapple syrup, simple syrup, fresh squeezed lime juice, mint.  Oh. My. God. Delicious.

My favorite drink though is not a cocktail--I would much rather have a glass of wine or really great craft beer."
"That's fucking awesome, dude."
I once had an 80-year-old grandma give me pennies.  PENNIES.  THE WORST CANDY EVER.
