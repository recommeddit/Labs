"CPH is superb place to visit. But not as great as all the hyped articles say, to live. Its very much quite subpar if you are not danish or very outgoing(even then questionable). Its not even most liveable place in Dk, I would say thats Aarhus."

"I saw her a few years ago and we weren't allowed to touch or have pictures with her, but I asked for an autograph to be made out to my dead brother who introduced me to them and she just gave me the biggest hug. Can confirm, very tiny woman."

"The Marriott Platinum Challenge is pretty easy to do http://loyaltylobby.com/2014/03/13/marriott-rewards-taste-of-gold-platinum-elite-status-fast-track-offers-2014/

Nine nights in three months, get platinum to 2016"
"It also survives multiple upgrades. There's no chip slot incompatibility or anything like that. A good investment imho. 

As long as you buy them at the right time. And I think this is a great time to get an IPS monitor."
That's not even a fucking documentary.
My copy of the film has that scene on the disc cover.
"I switched from Verizon to Google fi, and my signal everywhere got noticeably worse.

Not worth switching back because I hate Verizon, but Verizon definitely had significantly better service for me."
