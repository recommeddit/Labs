You pay a premium, but when you go there, it's clean, it doesn't feel cheap or ghetto, and you know where your money went. The other parks, a lot of them almost comparable in price to Dland, are pretty shitty in comparison, with tons of closed rides, closed kiosks, no operational order, and employees with shit attitudes. I'm not saying I want them to be smile robots, but man, if I need to ask you a question, don't stare daggers at me and give me some flippant answer.

I just came back from SeaWorld this weekend and we waiting in line for over an hour to get beer/snacks. Take that in.

Khloe- I think she has a good heart and has good intentions. She’s also very dedicated to working hard and she definitely did the most at Dash. / She can be annoying sometimes. I really don’t like her sense of humor and constantly belittling those around her. She can be insensitive. 

Kendall- My second favorite. The most vibey in the family and very chill. She is the only one I could see myself getting really close with as a friend. / She can be bratty and standoffish.

The good news is, though:
You have several choices, depending on your budget and the amount of features you want to use.

---
My personal preference:
[PDF Annotator](https://www.pdfannotator.com/en/) is the ""swiss army knife"": many features, highly customizable, but the license is quite expensive for normal end-users: 70€ (normal price) or 40€ for student (discount) licenses. Back when I went to university, I bought that software with the student discount and not once regretted it. It truly is some great piece of software, if you want or need a lot of features. Besides the pen-input itself (for highlighting/annotations), it has some nifty features like adding blank pages as a work-sheet for you to draw on, rotating single pages or merging/adding/removing single pages or whole documents. I've been regularly using PDF annotator to just merge several PDF documents into one file because it's so handy in that regard.

BUT - there's two potential downsides to that software:

1) With a heavy amount of features also comes some ""bloat"": Compared to other light-weight applications (like Sumatra or Foxit Reader), PDF Annotator feels quite ""slow"". Due to this I'm only using it when I know that I'll need to annotate (or otherwise edit) something in a PDF. If I only want to read stuff, the ""faster"" PDF apps are my go-to.

2) You need to be aware about their pricing model before you buy. I was quite upset when I was faced with their price-model for major upgrades (e.g. when there's big version changes, jumping from v5 to v6). 
I bought PDF Annotator Version 4 back in 2013, upgraded it once to version 5 (for free during the first 2 years if you have the ""upgrade assurance"") and have been using it since. 
BUT: If I wanted to upgrade to the newest Version now (v7), I'd have to shell out another 50€, which honestly sucks. The ""Upgrade Assurance"" for 'free' upgrades makes it a bit cheaper (17,50€ per year), but it's still... not ideal.

I totally get that developing niche-software is expensive, but that's a lot of money for a software upgrade and in some cases almost prohibitively expensive for some students.

[Xodo](https://www.xodo.com/) PDF is more light-weight and also free for personal use. If you don't need a lot of features, Xodo should be alright for working with a stylus.

[Drawboard PDF](https://www.drawboard.com/) emphasizes the workflow with a pen/stylus within PDF files. It was a one-time purchase once, but recently they went with a ""PRO"" subscription model (24,99€/year) on top of that. Haven't used the pro features before, so I can't really give a recommendation for those, but it's definitely on the cheaper end of ""feature rich"" PDF-annotation-software.

---

If you need more than a simple PDF editor, you might want to take a look at the feature-set of [Qiqqa](http://www.qiqqa.com/About/Features) (open source). It's a research/reference manager similar to Mendeley/Zotero, but has an inbuilt pdf viewer with editing/annotation capabilities. 

I don't know how solid the pen-support in that software is (especially compared to Drawboard/PDF Annotator) but you might want to give it a try if you can use the additional features of that software. There's some [additional user-reviews for it on AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/qiqqa/).

So yeah, that's my list. I've been trying to stay as ""paperless"" as possible for 10 years now and those are the PDF applications that I'd take a closer look at now. Sadly, most of the other PDF applications are geared towards businesses (and they show in their pricing that they really don't care or bother with ""normal"" end-users).",best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit
