26231,best politician,"I prefer to answer this type of question based on personal experience instead of what other people have said (i.e., historical figures).

So for me, I'd have to say Michael Bloomberg. He owed nothing to anybody. He did and said what he truly believed would keep New York as the best city in the world, and he succeeded. I didn't always agree with him, but I respected the hell out of him. Not once in his 12 years as mayor did I ever think to myself that he was pandering to anyone, attempting to score political favors, or angling for an opportunity to make the story about him. I just wish every politician could be like that."
