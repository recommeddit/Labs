Aight. We cool.
Just be careful because they jumped their prices recently. Very easy to miss!
"I think they discontinued the mini not long after I bought it, which is a pity because I love its size.

I definitely replace going to the bookstore with browsing the digital catalogue of the public library (Vancouver). I can risk reading books that I may not like without waisting money."
"Got her a weekend tip to London with me to see the Phantom of the Opera.

That was a good one, but I hadn't really thought through the cost of flights and hotel beforehand, but it was worth it."
"> The only real answer is to bring and declare a firearm in each of your checked bags.

That might work where you live, but most other countries would be like ""why the fuck is there a gun in your bag?"""
Thanks you very much my fellow human!
Do you know any good human stories?

"yeah i think the xr would fit well. i have an xr and i do pretty much the same things as you lol. the xr is strong on the battery game, im at 91% health and it still goes all day. i would say go for it, and you can even get airpods pro!

I have a guilty pleasure for Bath and body works body mists! A lot of them last as long as some EDTs when you layer them with their respective lotions.
"> I googled what the most versatile instrument would be because I had a feeling it‚Äôd be the drums. Google frequently finds quite good discussions via Reddit. Almost a reliable source.

"If you had one week as a tourist in the US I'd recommend going 

NYC to DC with Philly, Baltimore, Shenandoah or Gettysburg thrown in 

Or 

LA to LV with Grand canyon, death valley, or Joshua tree thrown in.

A lot of stuff in the USA is really far apart and I don't think most tourists want to pay for several days of rental cars in between international flights, but if you are not afraid of that I would recommend a road trip across the west covering Colorado, Wyoming and Utah"
"As to closed, full size headphones, you have to consider the AKG K550's currently retailing in the $200-$250 range and an excellent example of fairly neutral sounding closed headphones with a pretty decent soundstage.  Their only downside is obtaining a good seal for good bass if you have a small head.  If you have a normal or large head or if you add the Alpha Pads for $60 (because you have a small head) you get very adequate bass.  In addition, the stock AKG K550's are very comfortable for closed phones and even more so with the Alpha Pads."
The Masters program I've been accepted into is actually in France. Weather this summer has been crazy though. Are you in France yourself?
"okay:

no particular order cause thats too much effort, im just going through a bunch

madvillain - madvillainy

earl sweatshirt - i dont like shit i dont go outside

chance the rapper - acid rap

kanye west - my beautiful dark twisted fantasy

death grips - the money store

aesop rock - the impossible kid

nas - illmatic

kid cudi - man on the moon: the end of the day

kendrick lamar - to pimp a butterfly

eminem - the eminem show

(this is more albums ive listened to the most to outside of illmatic, tpab and the eminem show, the reason i dont listen to illmatic that often because for some reason im just never in the mood to listen to 90s boom bap and for the other two its because they are very long projects that dont have much replay value even though they are amazing albums in isolated listens.

those are the ones that came off the top of my head, probably a couple im forgetting - kinda not sure if i want to include tpab because its an album that has practically no replay value but if you havent listened to it in a while it will be fucking fantastic so idk. also some other albums i thought of but wasnt sure to put on or not: jpegmafia - veteran, denzel curry - ta13oo (both for the same reason in that they were just released - granted i didnt even really seriously put together a top 10 of all time either so including them would probably be fine but i just didnt feel right including such new projects) kanye west 808s and heartbreak (at first i wanted to include it cause its tied with mbdtf for being my favorite kanye album, but considering that 808s is hardly even a rap album it would of felt weird putting it on the list. namely because i feel like if im putting that on the list then why not just throw a weeknd album or frank ocean which are two artists i love but arent really rap artists)"

"I'm currently getting the 3-a spec rom and emulating it. Will be moving on to 4 when i've finished 3. Nothing mentioned so far seems to really fit it quite right, although i love how i'm clearly not the only one with this itch. 

\- i've been looking at the new NFS as well, the remaster of the old ones seem pretty cool, so they go on the list as well."
Classics.
"The Imperial Radch trilogy by Ann Leckie, but mostly the first book, Ancillary Justice. Truly original vision of AI, biotech, gender issues, cloning.

Also Yoon Ha Lee's Machineries of Empire. An idiosyncratic technology base unlike anything else out there. 

James SA Corey's The Expanse, for the sheer breadth and range of their vision. There's very little in the first book that hints at where we are now in the seventh (? I forget), but each step on the way progressed clearly from what came before and led to the next."
"TIL that the term RPG is used very loosely.

I actually searched for a definition and I found this:

""A¬†role-playing game¬†(RPG) is a game in which each participant assumes the role of a character, generally in a fantasy or science fiction setting, that can interact within the game's imaginary world.""

So pretty much any video game is an RPG according to that.  

""Play Pac-Man, an RPG where you assume the eponymous role of Pac-Man in the games imaginary world.""

No wonder there's so much confusion. üòÅ"
