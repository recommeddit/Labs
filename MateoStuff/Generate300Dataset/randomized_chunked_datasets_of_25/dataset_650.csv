9232,"i can see how costs have gone up due to coivd and in general cleaning. 

out of curiosity i would like to know how much you make an hour actually in someones mouth considering hygienists do about 70% of the work (100% in my case).

""go more often"". so my dentist can make more money doing nothing? sounds like something a dentist would say. :)

im almost 50 i have had 3 cavities in my life all before i was 16 when i never brushed my teeth at all.  i only brush once a day in the morning now. i have had my saliva tested by a dentist because they wanted to know how my mouth stays so good with little care. i have a rare enzyme that protects my teeth naturally i am told.

once every 5 years is enough considering i always have a great record with no issues. the longest i have spent at a dentists lately is for xrays. like i said i usually spend about 5 - 10 min in the chair.

could there not be a setup in charging based more on the work needed and less on a set $X/appointment. maybe i would pay $40 to have my teeth cleaned and john with a bad mouth would pay $200 to have his cleaned. that seems more in tune with cost vs work.",best toothpaste
53595,">Is it the same thing in smaller dosages

In general, yes. The other main difference is just that it comes as flavored chewable tablets or liquids, for kids who can't swallow pills.
