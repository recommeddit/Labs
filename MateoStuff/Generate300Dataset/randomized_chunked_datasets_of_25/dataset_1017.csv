the engineering side of me says ""if it moves up and down 20,000 times a second... my moving it back and forth over my teeth at 1 time per second isn't going to affect the localized motion of the toothbrush tip.""",best toothpaste

29189,"There are a lot more solutions people can choose from that the OP hasn’t listed. I agree that SiteGround is good and BlueHost is decent. DreamHost is another well-known one but it’s not one that I’d personally use. I’ve used GreenGeeks and BlueHost in the past, but these were only for ‘side hustle’ projects. For my main projects I use SiteGround. Now the thing with both BlueHost and GreenGeeks is that they’re good for those little side hustle projects you undertake for clients. You get unlimited subdomains and email accounts, they charge monthly AND you can lock yourself into a 3-year contract if you want to grab the discount (this is what I eventually did when I realised it was worth it). I also have a buddy who paid $150 for 2 years and got 1.5GB of ram. The only restriction was that his INODES were capped at - don’t quote me on this - 300k. Maybe a bit more. Anyhow, they also do 1-click installs of WP.",best web hosting service

and if you are up for the challenge or rather change in gaming style definitely play bloodborne and dark souls 3.
and there is nioh1 and 2 which are the best souls clone games. 
recently I've played divinity: original sin2 and although it's painfully slow at first few hours but definitely on of the best rpg games ever made.",Best RPG game on PS4

7911,"If someone just needs a laptop for streaming, browsing, and light office work (word processing, etc), then you don’t (really) need a dedicated graphics card or even a monster processor. You’ll find a lot of deals on here targeted to those things (dedicated gpus and newest cpus). 

The more important factors would probably be how this person wants to use the laptop. 

Will they be hooking it up to external monitors/tvs? If so, need to look at the ports to make sure that lines up with what they need. 

Will they be traveling with it a lot? If so, they may care about how thin it is and how much it weighs. 

Using it on the go? Battery life is likely to be important.

It’s hard to say without knowing the answers to those questions, but in all honesty you likely want to look at some thin, mobile, computers made by Asus, acer, or gateway. I would recommend Asus of those brands, but you can find good deals all over the place.",best laptop for general use
