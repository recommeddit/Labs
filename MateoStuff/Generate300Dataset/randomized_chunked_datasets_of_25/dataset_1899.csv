67644,axios alternatives reddit,Thanks for shedding light on fomantic ui for me! I have a project that has been out of dev for a bit but I always wondered why I wasn't getting semantic ui updates
180,best terminal file manager reddit,"We still need to implement colorschemes. I think colorschemes in termbox is a little limited for portability considerations (i.e. Windows) but we might be able to do 256 colors, not quite sure though. Also I was told that colors in `lf` is not consistent with `dircolors`. I need to check it out when I have some time."
72656,best wireless lightweight mouse,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. Its just written so natural with expressing your actual feelings rather than acting censored and polite.

And the written about the UL2 - this just killed me , i was actually laughing damn hard.

>If you have smaller hands and you're colorblind

Like , lmao... Legend!

I relate to everything written about FM , terrible company. Great shape. I use Scream mainly for the shape and that i found 2 for 40$ each. The shape is good very good. Cons : extremely slippery , with my sweaty hands its hard to find good grip for 1min> without readjusting my grip , awful feets , awful cable , too much post-travel , on both copies , the wheel encoder actuates itself like its ""stuck"" - annoying ingame. 

The XM1 is very interesting. I remember at the beginning it wanst getting any attention and infact the few people that tested it , didnt liked it. And out of nowhere it became the most popular and recommended mouse for claw - damn impressive. Im still waiting for the white one to arrive in my country. Sounds too good to be true , but i'll absolutely give it a shot , especially with this new UV coating that Roccat uses - by far the best coating i've touched!

Just checked your channel too , deserved sub. Nice reviews."

31468,best hotel to live in,The Maxwell in Seattle.  They put out a tray of delicious pineapple cupcakes in the lobby.  Normally I would never shill for any business but these cupcakes are good enough to make a corporate whore out of me!
73749,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Yeah. As I mentioned in the other comments, itâ€™s mostly the anti-glare that affects the screen quality for the Paperlike. If I was in a dark room, it looks a lot better. 

It doesnâ€™t really matter which angle Iâ€™m viewing it from, but it does matter where the light source is. Itâ€™s not as bad as I make it seem, but itâ€™s definitely noticeable."
38166,best Marvel movie,"I agree with u/Ace7of7Spades here.  *Infinity War* doesn't work.  Sure the characters break into manageable teams, but there really isn't any through line to the narratives.  The movie is a bunch of cgi action scenes stacked in a trench coat acting like it's a movie.  

The ""Thanos is the protagonist"" narrative doesn't really work for me either.  When I watched the movie the first time I was baffled by the lack of structure, but bought into that Thanos narrative and was ready to engage with it watching the movie again before *Endgame*.  I just don't see it.  It seems like an excuse to wipe away the lack of any of the other characters working in the movie.  Just because the audience is expected to know all the backstory of the other character (which barely follows through movie to movie) doesn't mean that there should be nothing that I am able to hold on to through *Infinity War*.

EDIT: And how does *Infinity War*'s pacing work in your opinion?  Fast bouncing around =/= good."
65539,best phone service company,Data breach is inevitable these days.
31239,best country to live in,"A lot of reasons. I think overall we are just a really arrogant country. Everyone I've ever met has this ""but we're Americans"" mentality that I don't really relate to. Also healthcare is more expensive, college is  more expensive, generally everything is more expensive."
