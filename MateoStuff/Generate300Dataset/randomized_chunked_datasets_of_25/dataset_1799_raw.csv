"I've been on many many carnival cruises, and one NCL. I was probably too young to appreciate the difference, but cruises are my absolute favorite vacation of all time.

Uhh really? I thought the life of some of the more powerful politicians are filled with escorts and drugs
"Yea, it's true that LA is a bit trashy/smoggy in some places. But, I find visiting Beverly Hills/ Hollywood to be fun, especially if your a film buff. He mentioned his girlfriend likes shopping, and so she would love Rodeo Drive... Also, getting a double dip at Philippes is awesome!

And, it's not as if the distance between LA and SD is too far, only a couple hours, so both can easily be seen.... However, coming all the way from London, it may be better to spend a little more and drive the coast from San Francisco down to San Diego"

"Having met **Hugh Laurie** in person, I can confidently state that he is one of the nicest and most humble celebrities out there. Not only is he completely happy to interact with his fans, but he also does so in a way that makes each and every one of them feel like they're a friend. He remembers names and personal details with amazing accuracy, and he makes each conversation seem like it's an extension of a treasured (and ongoing) dialogue. Add to that the fact that the man is outwardly hilarious, and you've got a recipe for a genuinely great guy."
At last somebody who knows about quality

"Keep in mind that Hilton typically raises the amount needed to redeem points every few years (Cat 6s were 40k points just two years ago).  I wouldn't recommend hoarding points.  Use them as often as you can.

Also, you only have $1m?  I would think you would have more than that.  Get the HH AMEX Surpass card also if you don't already have it."

"Ahh yes, the time Target carpet bombed 17,000 iraqis."
I think all time greats should be separated pre and post merger. Really hard to compare guys who played in the 1930's to guys today.
