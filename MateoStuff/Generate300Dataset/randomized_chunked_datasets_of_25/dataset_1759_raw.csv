The colourized WW2 documentary series is awesome.

They did last year. I still do on occasion. Not quite sure.

Are you buying for us? Did you post this from the deck of your yacht?
I did buy the 11 because I didn’t care about any of those things and it was fine - but I also exchanged it for the 11 Pro because I found I missed the tele lens.
"I've just seen this. In your case I'd pick a MacBook Air with M1 chip. The only limitation you might face is incompatibility with your games. You'd need to check if they are compatible with macOS and if they run under Rosetta2 in case they aren't translated to ARM. If not, they could also run on a Windows virtual machine under Parallels.

I don't suggest Huawei MateBook at all. I had a Huawei MateBook X Pro 2020, and I had to return it, because it was crazily overheating while charging it, even when it was turned off!

Now I own a MacBook Air and very happy with it. It always stays cool, has great built quality and battery lasts all day. It has a 13-inch display which has great quality."

I'm thinking about starting in Chicago and travelling across. Detroit looks pretty cool!
"The interesting thing about Washington as president is that he didn't actually *do* much.  He considered the Presidency more of an administrative position, that he was there to sign what Congress passed, and didn't try to do much policy-making himself.  So in that way, he was significantly different than pretty much every President to come after him.

That's why the history books focus almost solely on his role in the war and the Founding, and skip over his actual years in office.  There really isn't much to talk about.

(note: not saying this is either good or bad, just throwing in a little history...)"

"This is a useless LPT. You can pretty much assume that someone is going to open your bag if you check it and it's got anything other than clothes and toiletries in it. The TSA will open it. They will cut your cable tie and if there's something missing, finding out before you leave the airport isn't going to do you a damn bit of good. If you do only have clothes and toiletries in there, then you have no reason to care if someone opened it. If you're going to take electrics, or optics, or medicines, or jewelry then you should put that in your carryon bag.

Preferably you shouldn't pack anything but your clothes for about a week (or two max) (even if you will be gone longer since you can wash them), a hand full of toiletries travel bottles of soap, shampoo, and toothpaste, medicine that you need to take, a camera, and a laptop if you need it. Toiletries for longer than a couple of days are unnecessary, the hotel will provide some to you, and you can always stop at the local 7-11 or whatever to get something if you need it.

If for some reason you need bring some large, bulky, fragile, valuable item (like a musical instrument) it's better to ship it via fedex or something. Just call the hotel where you will be and arrange for them to receive it. Get it insured for equal or greater than its replacement value and ship it. If something happens to it you can get it replaced. That's way easier than trying to get the TSA to pay you for crushing your acoustic guitar. (LPT: You will have better luck getting blood out of a stone than getting the TSA to pay for something they broke or stole.)

Take it from someone who likes to enjoy overseas vacations, if you can limit your luggage to a single carry on do that. If you are of a normal size, don't take more than a couple of days worth of clothes, because you can buy more when you arrive. (You don't even need to take them home if you don't want. It'll probably cost you less to buy clothes there and just leave them behind than to check an additional bag.) Take only a day or two of things like toothpaste, shampoo, etc... You'll probably end up in a situation where you will need to use them occasionally, but most of the time they will be provided by your hotel and you can always buy some from the store if you need to. Other than that, take whatever medicine you need (plus a little extra in case you get stuck somewhere) and limited electronics. Maybe a single laptop or tablet with wifi and a smart phone which will accept a SIM card from the country that you will be going to. (If you don't have one of those, then it's better to just buy a cheap burner when you get there.)

LD;DR: Don't put anything in a checked bag which you would care if someone took it, and preferably don't check a bag at all."
"Fair point. I was giving a lot more weight to what I consider the best expansion areas and not the sum total of everything added. I agree that Pandora is amazing looking but Flight of Passage does not rank high for me. Toy Story land was underwhelming, new Fantasyland the same but seven dwarves is great. Cars land is awesome and would be my pick for second best overall new land. Admittedly I have not been to Star Wars land yet and I won’t be until my sides is done next year. Totally forgot Florida just opened RotR."

"File under: shows you haven't already likely heard of (parks and rec, 30 rock, etc.) 

""Scrotal Recall"" is hilarious. It's set in the UK and the main character just finds out he has an STD and needs to tell his ex Sexual partners about it (male telling females) and each episode is about the girl/lead up to sex. It's hilarious. Only 6 or so episodes easy binge."
