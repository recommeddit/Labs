17572,best iOS game,"Two Dots. 

You never need to IAP tools, I’ve got three stars on every single game level without using tools. 

It’s just so well made and there are new levels every week."
65845,best college in california,"I wasn't aware that Cambridge was a public school. I don't think it counts because a singular university is not a system. 

Do you have any more information on the public status of Cambridge?"
28832,best breakfast foods,"My in-laws take them camping, I was really sceptical when I saw dessicated hashbrowns in a milk carton, but they're surprisingly good.  Makes me think I've probably eaten them unknowingly at many diners because they taste like standard issue restaurant browns."
20301,best workout music,Blockbuster Night is pretty much the most hype shit I've ever listened to
17589,best iOS game,I would keep keep up with Riots stuff in general. They do f2p right. They just announced their gorgeous looking league of legends mobile port is not going to have ads in app at all. TFT is also really well done.
65036,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"I feel like La S-R is still pretty good, and it's still cheap. Sure, you can get more interesting tacos at Lily's, or more complex dishes at Los Arroyos or Los Agaves, but when you just want a simple bowl of cheese and chorizo, super Rica delivers, as they have for decades."
49538,best gaming monitor,"There is no point in having a powerful PC if you do not have a monitor to actually see the performance... it is essentially bottlenecking your computer in a sense to use a subpar monitor.   


The monitor is a fundamental part of a PC... it should not be ignored."
62469,Best RPG game on PS4,"No particular order but these are the best ones imo

* Divinity Original sin 1/2 

* Persona 5

* God of war

* Horizon zero dawn

* The Witcher 3 

* Any Final fantasy game 

* Nier automata 

* Skyrim/fallout 

* Assassins creed Origins/Odyssey"

73231,best Linux distro,">definitely between those 3 so do not suggest me another distro please

Well out of the three, I would say Mint Cinnamon then.

31919,best hotel to live in,"I've never lived long term in a hotel, but I've lived semi-long term in a _hostel_ with a private room. Very similar experience, I imagine, except you get a little more community and people are more interested in interacting, and the staff is usually smaller so you can build lasting relationships that are a little more meaningful. Plus, you know, cheaper and you can work out a breakfast/lunch/dinner package and whatnot if your budget allows."
429,best terminal file manager reddit,"When I am not in a terminal I use nautilus. I have been using bspwm as my window manager for a couple years, though. Looking for recommendations if someone has any."
11625,best gifts for dad,I'm sorry. It's such a tough disease.

47161,best state to visit in the United States,I agree with you about San Francisco except the weather isn't that great all year round. It's not San Diego weather which is phenomenal.
47266,best state to visit in the United States,"I'd like to add a vote for New Orleans as well.  Just know that the heat and humidity in Southeast can be oppressive.  

Another benefit on top of the food/culture/music/tons of stuff to do, is you could scratch your NFL itch while you're there if you time your trip right.

You also have the option of a short trip over to Baton Rouge to watch a college football game (in a conference that's known for rivaling or beating NFL teams for game attendance).

You'd also be a short trip from the prettiest parts of the Gulf Coast.  I'd recommend a couple days around the Destin part of Florida.  Especially as a way to recover if you party a little too hard in New Orleans.  On top of truly beautiful beaches and a different take on Gulf seafood than you'd find in New Orleans, there's other activities in the area that can be a lot of fun depending on your interests.

Can charter a deep sea fishing trip or watch the Blue Angels perform at home."
51158,best rap album,I'm more wondering about Stone Temple Pilots.  I thought the consensus was that they were (are?) fairly mediocre.
2932,best headphones,"I have HD559 and strongly recommend against them, as they are nothing like my previous HD555. The HD559 have lower sound quality, are muddy and far in a blanketed way. Since HD579 aren't sold anymore I would start with HD599 and up.

And no, that is not a Sennheiser sound if someone will try to tell you that. The HD555 were crisp and spacious with mid-low boost that made bass soft, bow strings flowing and added a bit of punch to electric guitars. The HD595 which are now known as HD599 are very similar, but sound even a bit more spacious."
30369,best Mexican war to study,"As he did not die in combat, his deaths are 0, making his KDR infinite."

21418,best workout music,"[To Glory - 2 Steps From Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abjE9Qx0O60)

I mean, personally I think most music from 2 Steps From Hell should be on your playlist, but if I can only pick one, that's it. That's dragon killing music right there. Sure as fuck can get you one extra rep."
63659,best books for time management reddit,"Do you mean not getting things done, or being late?"
51542,best iphone case,"I have been using baseus, and have been very satisfied with them.

42859,best detective show,"I watched the whole thing and enjoyed it, but had no idea about the suicide. It's fucked up that they left it out. Talk about bias!

That's the thing that has turned me off if documentaries. You have to tell the whole unbiased truth or it's just a propaganda piece. I started to watch the one about the former tight end for the NE Patriots, but I'm worried that it is more fan fiction than a serious documentary. it seems like everyone wants to play fast and loose with the truth these days. I'm not saying this particular show did anything wrong, I just don't trust them to tell the truth. I shouldn't have to fact check a show after I watch it."
