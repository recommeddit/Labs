Sure, you can get more interesting tacos at Lily's, or more complex dishes at Los Arroyos or Los Agaves, but when you just want a simple bowl of cheese and chorizo, super Rica delivers, as they have for decades.",best places to eat in Santa Barbara

Very similar experience, I imagine, except you get a little more community and people are more interested in interacting, and the staff is usually smaller so you can build lasting relationships that are a little more meaningful. Plus, you know, cheaper and you can work out a breakfast/lunch/dinner package and whatnot if your budget allows.",best hotel to live in

47266,"I'd like to add a vote for New Orleans as well.  Just know that the heat and humidity in Southeast can be oppressive.  

Another benefit on top of the food/culture/music/tons of stuff to do, is you could scratch your NFL itch while you're there if you time your trip right.

You also have the option of a short trip over to Baton Rouge to watch a college football game (in a conference that's known for rivaling or beating NFL teams for game attendance).

You'd also be a short trip from the prettiest parts of the Gulf Coast.  I'd recommend a couple days around the Destin part of Florida.  Especially as a way to recover if you party a little too hard in New Orleans.  On top of truly beautiful beaches and a different take on Gulf seafood than you'd find in New Orleans, there's other activities in the area that can be a lot of fun depending on your interests.

Can charter a deep sea fishing trip or watch the Blue Angels perform at home.",best state to visit in the United States

2932,"I have HD559 and strongly recommend against them, as they are nothing like my previous HD555. The HD559 have lower sound quality, are muddy and far in a blanketed way. Since HD579 aren't sold anymore I would start with HD599 and up.

And no, that is not a Sennheiser sound if someone will try to tell you that. The HD555 were crisp and spacious with mid-low boost that made bass soft, bow strings flowing and added a bit of punch to electric guitars. The HD595 which are now known as HD599 are very similar, but sound even a bit more spacious.",best headphones

That's the thing that has turned me off if documentaries. You have to tell the whole unbiased truth or it's just a propaganda piece. I started to watch the one about the former tight end for the NE Patriots, but I'm worried that it is more fan fiction than a serious documentary. it seems like everyone wants to play fast and loose with the truth these days. I'm not saying this particular show did anything wrong, I just don't trust them to tell the truth. I shouldn't have to fact check a show after I watch it.",best detective show
