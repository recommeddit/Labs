63055,Best online React course,Yeah I suggest to use React hook instead (combination of react Reducers and React Context). It will be faster and will have much less boilerplate and config. You can achieve the same design pattern with react hook than with Redux. I couldn’t recommend more this tutorial to learn React.Js [react Js tuto](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d). It is recent and thus uses new React functionality and is really clear!

56827,best desktop monitor,At that point just walk into your local walmart/bestbuy/staples and buy whatever 1080p monitor thats around $150.
49521,best gaming monitor,"like what was already said, high refresh rate is nice on gaming monitors, versus normal ones that have a max of maybe 90 hertz.

Another thing, however, is response time. usually TV's don't have a low response time, meaning there is slight input lag from the time you move your mouse to the TV displaying the movement. You will definitely notice a difference if you do decide to go for an actual monitor. But if you don't necessarily need/want a high refresh rate, any 1080p monitor will do fine"

16036,best sunglasses for fashion,"I only buy cheap sunglasses since I am the queen of leaving them on the top of my head to fall on the ground when I look up and/or stuffing them caseless into my bag.

For the past couple years I've stuck exclusively to the Wayfarer shape since I think they add some angularity to my round face and aren't comically oversized on my small face/head.

Sometimes I wear my husband's aviators and they are GOOFY on my cheekbone-less face."

7716,best laptop for general use,"Hello - 

I am currently living on a desktop with an i5-2400s and 8GB of RAM that is taking care of all of my needs (Office tasks, basic browsing - basic college student tasks although I am not in college any more) 

I am looking at this (Asus Vivo15): https://www.staples.com/asus-vivobook-15-x512da-15-6-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-3500u-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-windows-10-home-silver-x512da-bts2020rl/product_24463577

My question is - I want a laptop that will last at minimum 5 years.  I will keep it on a desk I am just tired to working so limited on my desktop.  Is this machine something that could last me that long, especially since I won't be taking it anywhere?

tx"
