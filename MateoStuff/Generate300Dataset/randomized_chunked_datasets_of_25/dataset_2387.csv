It's so hokey, calling all the villains ""The Cowboy"", ""The Technician"", ""The Chemist"" or something similar is so low effort. Not to mention the fact that it's just as packed with (the same) clichés as any other cable procedural. I just can't call that clever.

That being said, I'd get a cold and/or flu every season followed by sinus infection followed by bronchitis.  Spent all the money at the doctor (who did nothing) and took antibiotics (when it was probably viral in the first place).

Then my sister received her degree in pharmacology.  As in, she's the chick the doctor's consult regarding medicine.

Always buy generics.  Never buy name brand unless there's a medical reason.

##Zyrtec (cetirizine)

It's an antihistamine.  When you first get sick, your nose runs.  An antihistamine will stop that before it progresses any further.  But if you don't...

##Advil cold and sinus (ibuprofen + pseudoephedrine)

So your nose is now stuffy.  You need a 2-punch.  Ibuprofen (advil) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  It stops swelling.  Not only does it reduce fever, but it will stop swelling in your nose/sinuses.  The pseudoephedrine (sudafed) is a nasal decongestant and will get the gunk out.  They should be used together as the beginnings of a sinus infection need an anti-inflammatory so the nasal decongestant has a place for the mucus to go.

##Delsym (dextromethorphan)

Your sinuses are draining down the back of your throat and causing it to become inflamed (remember ibuprofen?) and it's making you cough.  This reduces your urge to cough.

##Mucinex (guaifenesin)

But if it's progressed to your bronchials and chest, guaifenesin will assist with breaking up the gunk in your breathing hole.  But remember, when using a chest decongestant, you're going to cough.  And it's necessary to get the gunk out.

So the moral of the story is you can buy a medicine cabinet full of generic drugs for a couple bucks and then take whatever you need, rather than spending big money on name brand combo drugs.

If you have a fever, you're contagious.  STAY HOME and don't infect your friends, family, coworkers, etc.  Don't return to work until the fever is gone.

And as always, don't take advice from the internet.  Go to your PHARMACY (not the doctor, he can't help you and all you're doing is infecting the doctor's office) and ask the pharmacist.  They are the experts on medicine.",best medicine for a cold
