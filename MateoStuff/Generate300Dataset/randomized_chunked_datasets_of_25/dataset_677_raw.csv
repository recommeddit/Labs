"Kylie , except when she does stupid thing like trademarking 'raise and shine '. She's just chill. I like that"
"> I prefer turkey bacon, but I won't judge

We will judge you though"
"Avoid Samsung, LG, Kenmore, GE, and Bosch. 

Kitchenaid, Whilpool or Frigidaire are better quality, they may not be as flashy as some other brands but you'll want a unit that last over it looking fancy."
Oh God.  I just pictured you taking a bath and washing your ass then brushing your teeth with that same bar of soap.
"Wow. You, you really put a lot of effort into these fallacies, eh?"
Dude you haven't even scratched the game yet lol.
What would Randy do?
"Ah, I love that! An expected pairing is always wonderful. Surprised people don't think this one actually smells like champaca, because I think it does, although it's not as prominent as perhaps Tom Ford Champaca Absolute.

I'm envious Champaca lasts on you, though - on me it's gone after 2-4 hours, which is tragic."
Shetland is good. Happy Valley. Foyle’s  War. Currently I’m watching DCI Banks which is also good.
"You actually have to have a Masters to be a priest, and seminary (priest school) usually takes 6-8 years. If you go to seminary straight out of high school, you go to what's called minor seminary for about 4 years and get your BA in philosophy. Then you go to major seminary for 3-4 years (4-6 if you already have your BA) and get your Masters. Your Masters is in Theology/Divinity and you have a concentration in a variety of fields such as Scripture, Church History, Systematic Theology, Moral Theology, etc.

Bishops and Cardinals pretty much all have doctorates. Some priests also have them, and the ones that do are likely to become bishops at some point.

Source: am Catholic, discerned the priesthood, and have friends who are priests."
The Game (1997)
Don't put it on your resume. It shows you make poor life choices in that you decided getting a degree from University of Phoenix was a good idea.
"Vim and only vim. I debug with it, I write and run my db queries in it, and I've written dozens of mappings and scripts to simplify working on the projects I work on and to completely customize my dev environment."
You are the first and only person I've downvoted in WATMM.
Love Ranger and MC and use both interchangeably.
It's the Ninjas cutting onions.
"Thank you for the great comment! I agree that test driving these cars will be a good way to decide which one I like best. You make a good point about the price difference. I wasn't aware of the tax credit, so that certainly does change things. 

5 superchargers is actually quite a bit in one city IMO. But I understand your point. I guess the difference is that superchargers seem to be more reliable and faster than other chargers, but I may also be biased.

What made you decide to go with the Niro over the Model 3?"

The main exclusive that ps4 has for me is spiderman. The rest I can give a miss.
Books are a nice gift. Especially if the person giving it read and loved the book. It's like I enjoyed this story so much that I want to share it with you.
"It really depends on the tools that the individual uses, as well as your use case. Most stacks and frameworks have their preferred hostess where maintenance and deployment is simpler than on others. For this, you have apps like Apex Up, Zeit Now, as well as FlyWheel for WP and Heroku. Render is a fairly new one that’s worth checking out too as they try to be an all-rounder while at the same time delivering integrated workflows. And then, of course, you’ve got the more traditional hosting providers, such as the aforementioned SiteGround, BlueHost and DreamHost."
What a dick!
"I'm considering using mint to be my budget tool,  but I'm a little cautious about linking my bank account to mint. How safe is it exactly?"
"I love it! There's just enough new content (once you've done all the ""main game"" levels) in the weekly challenges to have enough to do while waiting for the train etc. 

I'm continually impressed how good the balance is, because I've played games like Frozen Freefall extensively and after a while you reach levels that cannot be completed without tools.

That said, I wasn't so keen on their subsequent release, Dots & Co - the balancing wasn't nearly so well done there."
