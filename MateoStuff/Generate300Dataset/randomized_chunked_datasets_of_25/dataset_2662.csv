37261,best amusement park,"Its not that surprising that KI is more popular than Holiday World in Indiana. Its about the same drive time from Indianapolis to KI as it is to Holiday World and the prices between the parks are not that different. KI is a much bigger park with more coasters and a lot of schools in Indiana take field trips there. Holiday World is great, but its in southern Indiana, which is less populated and is a much smaller park."

30216,best Mexican war to study,"In the NYC area, I was taught that Texas (unsurprisingly) decided the rules of the Spanish Empire didn't apply to them and went of of their way to cause a conflict to happen, knowing they would win.

This caused the mouse trap to spring when Mexico (justifiably) saw he annexation of Texas as an act of war. The US side knew that the crumbling post-Napoleonic colonies of the southern border were not going to be able to put up even a half decent fight, and so brutally rocked a weaker opponent.

It was a strategy to consolidate the resource rich lands to the south west as per Manifest Destiny."
