https://www.veganosity.com/vegan-oil-free-zucchini-carrot-fritters/

Last time I made them, I left out the onions and sage, added in half a pound of cooked ground turkey and frozen corn, meant to add in cheese but forgot, used 2 real eggs instead of flax eggs, added in a half cup of yogurt, and accidently bought limes at the store instead of lemons--and maybe all of that is why my fritters weren't at all crispy (but oh well, they're still good). 

One batch fit on a cookie pan, so if you've got multiple cookie pans, it would be worth it to make more batches at once! Then just freeze them and pop one or two in the microwave on your way out the door.

If you have a juicer, you could also juice the veggies, drink the juice, and use the pulp--that's basically what the process in the recipe about to anyway.",best breakfast foods

16837,"K so I’ve pretty much had every domestic pet you can have. Rabbits, ferrets, lizards, cats, dogs, horses, exotic parrots etc. 

Easy lizards, like geckos or anoles would be a good bet. I had anoles/longtailed lizards when I was a kid, it was one of my first pets, and they’re insanely easy to take care of. Plus you do get to touch them (minimally, anoles tend to bite even though it’s not painful, it’s like a dull pinch). 

Leopard geckos were my favorite because they’re super docile. 
Parakeets are pretty easy too. The budgie/cockatiel types even. Be aware that you guys may be allergic to the down feather dust. 

Fish can be a pain in the ass but overall once you get a tank set up (water at the right PH, nitrate and nitrite balances etc) they’re really easy to maintain. But that probably won’t suit a kid that wants a cuddly pet. 
Otherwise, someone above suggested volunteering at a shelter. That’s genius. You don’t have any responsibility and plenty of shelters are looking for people to help socialize animals, particularly cats (as I’m aware of) since they’re usually filled with them. Dogs a little less so because some no-kill shelters have more aggressive types that wouldn’t suit young children. 
Or you can always make friends with people that have pets. Then it’s not your burden. I have to say, as a kid I hung out with far too many people simply because I wanted to see their dogs/horses/what have you than I should admit lol.",best pet for toddlers

Im not disagreeing with you.



However, just because others do doesnt mean you should call them racists or insult them. Just say you disagree with their position. Libertarians disagree that people should be forced to sell to people who they dont want to sell to. Its not racist. You can respectfully disagree all you want, but its a legitimate political difference.",best politician
