69957,best major to study in college,"History majors aren't quite as hard to find a job, IF you know how to package your skill set. A good school will teach you about specific subjects, sure, but the skills of how to do research are going to be valuable in a number of fields. I know that the FBI and CIA have recruited among History majors, for instance. Highly recommend getting other languages under you belt as well. History dovetails nicely with a lot of other fields, so consider double majoring, if you have the fortitude for that much work. Also, for heavens sake, try to get an internship in somewhere while you are in school."
