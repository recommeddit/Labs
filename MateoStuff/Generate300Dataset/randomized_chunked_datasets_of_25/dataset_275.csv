This is my first iPhone.  I’ve used OtterBox Commuters on all of my Androids but I’m tired of the two-piece system and wanted to try something new - hope I don’t regret it.  They’ve protected my phones from a lot of falls and even an accidental throw of sorts.",best iphone case

53932,"I'm an ER doctor and I see patients with the cold all the time. I endorse your statement of asking the pharmacist first and buying generics. But also, consider calling a primary doctor on day 1, because you often can't get an appointment for 3-5 days with a PCP in USA. If you took your symptom meds and feel better, great, just cancel the appointment the day before. If you don't feel better, you now have a clinician to listen to your lungs and maybe get a chest X-ray in case a more serious illness like pneumonia is developing. Seeing the PCP is waaaay cheaper than coming to the ER. Your ER copay may be the same cost as a whole PCP visit.",best medicine for a cold
24967,"Tobey Maguire gave the performance the movies needed for that era. His earnest performance grounds the movie in emotional truth, and then that allowed Raimi to allow the environment and world around him to be cartoon/comic like while still having audience buy-in. It's like Mark Hamill in the first Star Wars, we needed earnestness to buy into the rest of the world.

Andrew Garfield came across as smug and unlikeable to me. 

&#x200B;

Tom is solid, but I feel like the script for his solo outing held him back. He's not getting a chance to explore the pathos of Peter Parker, and that makes it feel like a fast food/diet brand version of Spidey. He's a very charming and likeable lead, though.",best spiderman actor

There are a few affordable 1080p 144hz VA panels.

It is assumed the budget VAs all use the same panel as the Samsung C24FG70/C24FG73, just without the quantum dot:

1. Acer ED242QR

2. MSI Optix G24C/Optix MAG24C(this version costs more because it has a better stand)
