"I'm such a dummy, I also was picturing a full sized lawnmower. I have no idea why. I have 19 years worth of knowledge and my brain came up with the mental image of a big ol push lawnmower proudly displayed on your dad's dresser."
"I haven't played it but it strikes me as the ultimate uncontroversial pick. Nobody would disagree with you if you had it high up in your list but as you've said it seems pretty rare to see it as the number one game in any individual list. People seem to feel more strongly one way or the other for Gloomhaven, Scythe, and Terraforming Mars than they do for A Feast for Odin."
"Well they do more than just drop it on a piece of grass. I didn't really know how to explain it. I was just trying to point out that other parks actually theme/landscape their rides instead of putting it on concrete like SF. Most Cedar Fair coasters are not really themed but have beautiful landscaping and placement in the park. Only a very few do have themeing in CF and I will admit that. Some of them do have slight themeing like Maverick at CP. Some of coasters that I have seen really themed are too short or not that fun because they spent so much to theme it or it is too distracting. Also, It just depends on what you think themeing is. Some people might say Maverick is themed, some may not. Same with the Smiler. Some people might want more themeing. Some people might not even liked themed coasters. It just depends on what you like and what parks you go to. I know it takes a lot to theme a ride, but different people may say different things and hate some themeing while liking others. Also, a lot of ""themed"" rides are not that themed.
Also, a lot of the coasters at CO and other CF parks are so fun and look so nice that they don't need to be themed.

Sorry for all the text. I am on mobile and have no idea how big this will be. I will have to shorten it later."

"**OPERA/OPERA GX**

So I've been using Opera & Opera GX for years, and I am happy with it.

IMHO, Opera GX is the most modern, fast, and easy2control browser.

By the way, the typing sounds in Opera GX are so good. :D

I am not disrespecting other browsers, they're cool too ;)

I've started on Mozilla Firefox, but it kept crashing on my win7 so I started using Opera. I'm happy with it."

"But if they're awesome parents, they'll do what mine did.

My parents told my brother and me that there was a troll living in our basement, and he requested to hold onto/have some of our Halloween candy as payment for letting us live in the house. After we had a hefty amount of candy Halloween night, we had to hand over the rest. We then had to ask Mom or Dad for some candy, who in turn had to negotiate with the troll. This trick worked for a good amount of time."
shia labeouf...
"Several bloggers listed ""Clannad"" to represent the entire franchise, without specifying which season they like more.  I thought it would be redundant to include both, so I counted ""Clannad"" as a vote for season 1.

I did the same for ""Monogatari"", which I counted as a vote for Bakemonogatari."
Love the doily.
