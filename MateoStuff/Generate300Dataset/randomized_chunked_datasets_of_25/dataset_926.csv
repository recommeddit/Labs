Also, it's assumed that it's dicaprio's kid. she's gettin down on him not long after damon can't perform. I don't remember if she gives a time frame of how long she's been pregnant, but at that time she and damon's character had been in a relationship a while so you assume they were (at least) attempting sex on a regular basis in addition to actual sex with Dicaprio's character",best movies with a cool twist

70001,"Chemistry Technician here. I do a lot of the hands on and less of the formulations and stuff. Sometimes it's cool seeing the chemistry, but depending on the schedule, you get to enjoy the science less and just do more work. Seeing what the actual chemists do, they sit in an office and crunch numbers and call people all day, very little hands on for them. If you want to do fun chemistry, QC is probably your best bet, but they often have to work late hours",best major to study in college

25241,"For me, Toby was a great Peter Parker but not very believable as Spider-Man. Whereas Andrew Garfield was pretty believable as Spider-Man, especially in the way he was built all lanky and spindly. But the skater/photographer/sometimes genius aspect of his Peter Parker didn't sell me. Not that most of that was his fault at all. 

But Tom Holland absolutely crushed it as both Peter Parker and as Spider-Man. He sold them both so well.",best spiderman actor

7343,"Hey, thanks for putting this list together! I've scrolled through a few of your threads and am always blown away by how thorough you are. You rock!

I was hoping I could pick your brain for a minute. I'm shopping for a laptop on my own for the first time and I could use a bit of guidance. 

I'm a college student looking for a laptop for general use and light gaming (the latter not being a necessity, but would be nice). Good battery life is a must, preferably not super heavy or bulky, and preferably <$1000. I also am not looking for a 2-in-1, just a standard laptop. 

Currently using a Dell Inspiron 13 that's nearing the end of its life. I've been overall happy with this laptop, but it's given me issues with the sound and has an awful battery life. As long as these issues can be avoided, I'm open to just about anything. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!",best laptop for general use

How often do you feed the gecko and how many crickets? Do you just go buy fresh crickets every week or two?

I'm from Texas, so when I think ""cricket"", I don't think of something small enough for a smallish lizard to eat. I think of these giant black nasty things that like to swarm all over building walls in August/September during what I assume is breeding season. Eew.

I also have geckos..just not PET geckos. They live in my yard and my garage and are about the size of my pinky finger. [They are SO freaking cute!](http://citybugs.tamu.edu/files/2010/04/gecko1s.jpg)",best pet for toddlers

5880,"Generally yes. However it is of course possible to just write it to a file too; a server is after all just a computer. There might be some security risks with that though \(I'm mainly a front\-end developer, so this is not something I know a lot about mind you.\), like someone could download the files you use to store the hashes if you don't secure them properly. I guess the main advantages with a sql database \(and other kinds of databases\) is that it is designed to be useful for HUGE amounts of data, so that you can pick out a specific row or user very quickly even if you have millions, and that it manages writing to disk for you so you don't have to worry about the disk being too slow or overwriting something.

But don't be too afraid of experimenting when you are learning. If you want to try out creating a login for the web go ahead, just don't create a popular site with a database of credit card numbers :D If you want to learn the HTML part of the sign\-in process for example, you don't really need a complex database system and a fully fleshed out backend; start simple, see how you can get form data from the html to the back\-end for example. The last web app I created doesn't even store anything at all; all the data is just variables, and when the server restarts all is lost, but I found it was good practice and a handy little website no less.

Have fun!",best programming language for web development
