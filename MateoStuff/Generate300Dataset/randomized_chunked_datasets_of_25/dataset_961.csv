56072,best action and adventure movie,"The original [Clash of the Titans](http://manapop.com/film/clash-of-the-titans-1981-from-myth-to-movie/) does have a lot of charm, and certainly better that the [shit remake](http://manapop.com/film/clash-of-the-titans-2010-review/), but it did play pretty fast and loose with Greek mythology."
24330,best anime,"Me too! Probably NGE, Bebop, Akira, Paprika (or some other Satoshi Kon film) and Lupin III Castle of Cagliostro right near the top I'm guessing. And at least three Ghiblies of course."
47807,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Huh. Oh well. Here’s the course. As you can see at the bottom it wants you to know how to use a CAS system. And actually to get a math degree here, you have to take Math 1200 which is a class that teaches you how to use a CAS system

4655,best text editor,"VSCode is more than a simple text editor, it's an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

I personally use VSCodium which is a fully open source fork of VSCode minus Microsoft telemetry and tracking 

There's text editor like Notepad++ which can do the job, depending on your feature requirements.

You should specify which operating system you are using and which features you need so we can suggest some that fits your needs :)"

68113,best science fiction novel,It's one of my favorites. Love the different stories and how they're told. The world built is awesome.

34075,best NFL player,no he doesn't. the two aren't even comparable. they played in what are essentially two different leagues entirely due to the contrast of the eras they played in. jerry would've destroyed in Hutson's era. you know that. I know that. hutson would get owned in modern day football. it's like comparing a great high school player to a great pro.

30913,best country to live in,"I'd rather like to live in Australia. I used to want to live in Russia, but I'm bi, so I'd be fucked up shit creek if I lived there."
33325,best electric car,"They're going to replace the whole battery for all the 2017-2019s, and individual cells for 2020-2022.

It's definitely not going to be cheap.

However they don't even have the batteries made yet that they're going to use for replacing. They're not 100% confident LG has found the problem, nor how to guarantee it won't turn up again in production.

 So this will take years to fully roll out."
31805,best hotel to live in,Not really.  One of the reasons I enjoy a modest and boring place is that I think people should just use it for sleeping.  I try to get out as much as possible and experience the world.  Even if it means just reading in a coffee shop.
72860,best Linux distro,"Parabola looks interesting, they look like they use an Arch base, presumably with some changes to get rid of blobs."
