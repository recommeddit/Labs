Here's one you forgot https://www.freetechbooks.com/ I'll look and see if I have any others. Keep this list alive so we can add to or delete it.
Scents have very high markups. It's possible to find stuff in that price range online once you know what you like.
Painting a bedroom blue isn't great as it will suppress melatonin and make it harder to get to sleep.
Especially on your penis. Just a friendly reminder.
"none of his ideas are really crazy, people get all riled up about free college as if its some revolutionary idea, its not. europe has free college, and its not like free education as a whole is something strange, we have it now up to HS. of course ya know taxes, but its not like we dont pay that now for highschool."
Apparently he begged large professor to produce it all
Amazing film. Just stay away from the American remake.
The Prestige has a FANTASTIC ending
"I will recommend to NordVPN, AirVPN, Mullvad or Windscribe for torrenting. There have many VPNs on the internet. So, I will suggest you must compare the [best VPN for torrenting](http://bestvpnchoice.wordpress.com/2021/09/30/best-vpn-for-torrenting/)."
"The Wall of Winnipeg by Mariana Zapata. It's got Humor, Slow slow burn, hot guy, nerdy girl. My favorite romance book ever."

"LD50 of methanol for skin contact is 15.8g per kg according to this site:[https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/14280.htm](https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/14280.htm)

If I understand the mechanisms of LD50 that means for a 200lb adult if you slather 1.5kg of methanol all over your body, there's a 50% chance you'll die.  The neurological effects would be no joke either though, so even if you survived you'd still be pretty messed up.

For some napkin math...Considering we probably only apply half a gram of the stuff at a time (just a wild guess) and it is most likely only 60-70% anyway that's about 1/4 gram per-serving.   That's 1/10000 of the LD50 in a single dose, unless I've missed a factor or ten here or there.

I'm not entirely sure what to do with this interpretation, as it most like has significant errors.  But I'll say this, if you're drinking a little bit of alcohol every day you're probably going to be okay with whatever is in the hand sanitizer as ethanol counteracts methanol - ethanol therapy is literally an option for people with methanol poisoning.

If you don't drink, or if you have kids you're probably not going to want to give them a shot of rum every night so its best to be careful and get the right stuff."
"Thanks! That's some lucky timing...!

They've updated the [page I linked in my OP](https://support.goodnotes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000788955) also, but that seems to refer to iOS. I don't see anything in the patch notes for MacOS but I'll give it another shot when I have time, and update back here to confirm. Thanks again :-)"

"Maybe I did not describe it the way I wanted. I do not know if Linux Distros can be upgradable the way Win10 is with Win11 , like no need for a format to install a new version of the OS. 

Also my laptop is an i3 11th gen and 8GB so no need for a lightweight OS I think."
"I worked at one of the premier hotels at a ski resort in the country; top 10. Met celebrities, royalty, politicians, athletes. 

Hockey players are the nicest athletes by a wide margin. Royalty is great or more likely, awful. A list celebrities want to be left alone or treated as just another person. Politicians are bigger assholes when they’re with their families. Saw lots of sex, drugs, underaged drinking, escorts, the usual. 

I was most amazed by how nice staff were to guests when management continually made our lives harder and shittier. We’d just let it roll off our backs and keep smiling until we just quit. We were paid so little and respected so little by management. If you weren’t thick skinned then you quit by week’s end. 

Best thing I saw was the hotel dog (think alpine dog that people can pet, kids can get woken up by him in the morning, plays on the ski slopes, etc)...well he escaped his pen, made straight for the high end restaurant and went hog wild. Jumped on a few tables and scarfed $100 steaks like they were M&Ms. Me and another guy saw it (we worked during the ski day and cleaned up into the evening so it was just him and I finishing up in our department at the time which was by the dog’s kennel)...we both saw he was going to escape and we could have stopped it but we just wanted to watch the world burn. Greatest day of work there by far."
Strawberry was all the way down here? People are missing out.
"Yeah, new ones (unlike Spectres) don't demand a genuine USB-C charger."
"This is minor squabbling, not hilariously toxic. And this sub is not hippies trying to save the planet lol - it's a group of mostly wealthy enthusiasts, some of which want to reduce their (likely very large) carbon footprints. I don't know many hippies who discuss all the minor details of expensive personal vehicles."
"My sister had a minor part in a movie with Brie Larson and Rooney Mara ages ago (I was an extra). This was right before they both got big, maybe ten years ago. They still keep in touch with her every so often and even remember my name. Very talented but also nice."
