26215,best politician,"Cato the younger? A fool that allowed his principles lead to him being manipulated by Cæsar? I suppose I can see the appeal in him, but I can not shake the feeling that he managed to play himself one to many times, just because he wanted to be holier-than-thou among all the senators. 

Cicero was a great politician though, had some flaws. But his influence even today is rather great. Atleast if you practice law."
3899,best online college,Really? I feel like that's kind of harsh. Some people don't have the option to physically go to school. Do you at least give them a chance based on other qualifications?

65833,best college in california,"It's still easier to space out the cost of college over 22 years than it is over 4 years... Even saving $100 a month from the time they are born you'd have $40,000 with a 6% average return by the time they are ready for college. That is a decent chunk of a CSU leaving you with manageable student loan debt.. if any"
