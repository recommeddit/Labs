53572,best medicine for a cold,You can get rebound stuffiness though if you use it too long though.  I became dependent on it.
68406,best science fiction novel,I loved reading books 1 and 2 as odd adventures and world building.  Book 3 felt the most aimless.  But book 4 is what ties everything together and reveals the wonderful intricacies of its puzzle.  It's  also a series that greatly rewards rereading.
31016,best country to live in,"You make sweeping generalizations about Americans but then complain that America is too diverse. Which is it, are we all the same or are we too different?

Why do you think diversity is a bad thing?"

55529,best action and adventure novel series,"When I was reccommended this series by a friend I read the first chapter.  The next day I told him that it was the most boring book thing I've ever read.  A few weeks later I picked it up again and drug my feet through the first 8 or so chapters.  Then it hooked me.  I couldn't put it down after that.  If you're not hooked by chapter ~10... I don't know what to say.  Give it a little more.

The chapters are short enough that its not a pain to read like some other books.  Its easy to pick up and put down.  Once you get into it a bit more, you'll begin to realize the organic writing style that Rothfuss has.  Quite pleasant on the brain."
68309,best science fiction novel,"Really enjoyed both three-body trilogy, and fire upon the deep. Just sayin'.

EDIT: definitely read the full trilogy of three-body tho - unlike a lot of other sci-fi/fantasy epics, the creativity does not peter out at all in the later books. Consistently brilliant throughout."
