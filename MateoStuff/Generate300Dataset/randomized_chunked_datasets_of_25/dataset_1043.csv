55529,"When I was reccommended this series by a friend I read the first chapter.  The next day I told him that it was the most boring book thing I've ever read.  A few weeks later I picked it up again and drug my feet through the first 8 or so chapters.  Then it hooked me.  I couldn't put it down after that.  If you're not hooked by chapter ~10... I don't know what to say.  Give it a little more.

The chapters are short enough that its not a pain to read like some other books.  Its easy to pick up and put down.  Once you get into it a bit more, you'll begin to realize the organic writing style that Rothfuss has.  Quite pleasant on the brain.",best action and adventure novel series
