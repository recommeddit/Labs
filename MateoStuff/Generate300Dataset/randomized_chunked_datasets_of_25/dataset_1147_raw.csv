Isn't Zen 3 on a different socket and chipset? 4000 is Zen 2+ right?

Mark has his channel so optimized I'm not sure you're ALLOWED to use youtube without watching something from him.

"The people at my local HD are generally more knowledgeable and friendly. The product quality and selection at Lowes is better than HD.

Solution? Go talk to the folks at HD with questions, have them tell me what I need, then go buy it at Lowes."
It's a great movie with amazing performances all around. Denis Villeneuve is a fantastic director!
I love how half the people here think this is hilarious and the other half are horrified.

"If you are really searching for ""best"" courses, you should search for it on Frontend Masters, not Udemy. [This](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/) one for example."
damn what plant
"From what I've heard, sometimes. So far it's cheaper than what I was doing and financial aid is helping out."
It surprises me every time I see snake people but damn it's great for an unexpected laugh.
How is northeastern not even on that list rippp

"I'm not confident regarding the curriculum of most schools, but I know some have engineering majors take almost identical classes during the first year or two of college, allowing students to commit to a specific engineering field after taking some electives.

Edit: I completely understand that most curriculum is different in some way, and that most introduce major-specific classes early on (that's why I mentioned it above).  I'm speaking mostly to the schools that intentionally parallel the curriculum for the first year or two for all (or most) engineering majors to allow for a choice to be made after some engineering electives have been taken, and the decision is more informed."
"you know I started liking ranveer esp during his padmavat promotions (and i gave up on bollywood a while back) and based on how dedicated he was and even was about to respect him but somehwere down the line during his promotions for simmmba and gully boy (esp when he had the level of self importance to jump into a crowd of people) i started seeing how crazy he is. No matter how talented he is, he carries his fame very poorly and he's taking it far too seriously. It's like they start to believe their own marketing material almost."
Really enjoyed this discourse. Nicely done /u/smallquestionmark & /u/theologi.
"Became? It's been the ""hacker distro"" ever since it was called Backtrack.

Also it was never meant to be more than a bootable hacking toolbox."
"I put off watching this for a while just because it's in German and I worried I wouldn't catch all the subtitles since I'm usually doing other stuff while watching.

Turns out that even though I paid 100% attention, I still was confused for at least the first half of the series.  If you've seen it, you understand what I mean when I say it's hard to track who's who after a little while.

But ultimately, I loved it.  Sounds like Season 2 is going to be out next year. Can't wait."

"It's not just the tent though, camping gear is pricy.

A good sleeping bag and ground mat are bare minimum unless you want to freeze your balls off."
"If you liked *American Movie*, I think you'll love *Dancing Outlaw*. It's a short documentary, cheaply made for a local West Virginia PBS station, but it soon went viral through VHS copies and word-of-mouth due to its fascinating subject: Jesco White, a white trash, sociopathic, glue-sniffing, Elvis-impersonating tap dancer in rural Appalachia.

It's on YouTube:

The *Jackass* producers financed a full-length follow-up 20 years later, *The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia*, also excellent, which follows Jesco and his extended family for a year. ([Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQBiXDNVeSA))"
I’m a huge fighting game fan and I’m very excited to see how Riot handles the scene. I definitely think they can make a free to play fighter and set the precedent for it in the scene.
