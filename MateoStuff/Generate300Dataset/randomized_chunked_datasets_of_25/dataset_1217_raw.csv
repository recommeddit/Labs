"Deviant Ollam has several great talks on TSA keys/locks, elevators and penetration testing, and the mentioned firearms in luggage when flying (especially with tech or expensive gear).

"That's a solid gaming device, but I really don't think that it is worth spending more for. You end up paying quite a lot just to get a dedicated GPU that you won't be using."
"Jade Mountain is an incredible resort. If you want a bit of mountains and a bit of beach, add on Sugar Beach. 10/10"
Ya hot hand fallacy going hard here.
Chorizo and egg breakfast tacos. If I have time I'll cook up some potatoes as well.
I’ve met his nephew. Even he said the guy’s a dick.
Mostly the CLI but sometimes I use pcmanfm for convenience. It's nice and light and does all I need.
"Sorry, but I think it's yet another thinly veiled self-congratulatory gesture for STEM undergrads."
"I would say it’s the Asus PG259QN and Dell AW2521H for 1080p, Dell AW2721D, Acer XB273U GX and Gigabyte FI27Q-X for 1440p and LG 27GN950 or upcoming 27GP950 for 4k"

Although I shoot all the images in RAW+JPG on my android, I don't edit them as much as I do with my Mirrorless, but it is nice to know that I can fix things in post if it is an important photo. Also, I guess it is nice that an Android RAW isn't really the same as a standard RAW because it still uses the HDR+ median blend image (smart HDR on Apple) and gives you that without the extra corrections to color / noise / sharpness."
To be left alone. If my wife took my kids out for the day that would be awesome. I love them all dearly but a day of me time without being asked to do shit for everyone else would be fabulous. It turns into a day where I have to do shit I don't want to do because everyone else has their own ideas about what fathers day should be.
"Thank you, will keep it close!"

I've got my first game of twilight imperium this week on tabletop sim. Super excited to play that game looks incredible. Learning the rules took forever and I'm in charge of teaching everyone so I hope I get it right.
