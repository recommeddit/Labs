He told us all about his past career and how much he enjoyed talking to people who enjoyed his films. He was super polite, told great jokes, and he listened to all the things people had to say about him. 

Not like Mickey Rooney the year before. That guy was a prick.",best celebrity

32166,"Ritz Carlton. My dad had been booked in one of their rooms by his new company for a training seminar when I was a kid. Our family went on the trip and we pulled in about 11pm after driving for hours.  The concierge checked the computer, blanched and started apologizing profusely, saying our room had been double booked and the other people were already there.  He went away for a few minutes, then the manager came back and said ""we only have one room left tonight, if you'll come with me I will show it to you and you may have it for free if you approve.""  

We figured it was gonna be a broom closet in the basement, and would've been happy to take it, but instead the elevator went up and up and when we reached the top floor, he led us all the way down the hall.  When we got to the end, we saw two gorgeous wooden and brass doors.  I remember my parents looking at each other with big eyes, but just then he opened the doors and flipped the lights, and we gazed upon a Steinway concert grand parked under a crystal chandelier, in the living room of the Presidential Penthouse Suite.  There was also a dining room, breakfast room, full kitchen, separate bedroom and two bathrooms. The only downside was the very faint whiff of fresh paint, since Motley Crue had stayed there the previous week (this was the 80s, in their guitar-smashing heyday.)

&#x200B;

The service was really impeccable though, 10/10 would stay again if I could afford it.  They treated us ragamuffins from the sticks like we were royalty. Also, I loved playing the piano so it was super-fun to attack my practice sessions on a) a baroque-style Steinway and b) the same piano Elton John and a bunch of others had played on.",best hotel to live in

I’m just trying to point out that it seems to be really widely used even in new projects, taught in boot camps, and I can’t speak on the quality of commits, but they seem to be still coming in even for a pretty mature library. I am just skeptical that `axios` is “mostly dead” just like this sub was claiming `redux` is supposedly dead too.",axios alternatives reddit
