That is probably the most relevant gif I have seen this whole week.
"That's just outright wrong.  Everclear will not burn your skin.  Ethanol and isopropanol are common solvents in shops as well and I've been literally covered in the stuff.  It will burn your mucous membranes and this can cause cancer, so it's not good to drink it, but not your skin...

As well, every lab I've ever set foot in had reagent ethanol in a squirt bottle handy.  Usually a few scattered around the lab.  Some denatured and at least one not."
Joe Rogans was good
">5: You don't have to stand by the door,

Do it, that'll make it extra creepy. Also keep your candy in the basement, in a bowl that is glued to the ground. Ask the kids to join you and get their candy."
Heading back country camping next week for 7 days. Was going to ask about this today. Brilliant!
A can of soda. I got around 3 in one neighborhood.
Korea was justified. South Korea was created by US.
"Spyderco Endura 4, $70. $90 with the lanyard my boss made me. Haven't done much but clean and occasionally hone it since I got it and it's still sharp as shit. Would HIGHLY advise"
"WHAT?!
What state did you grow up in? We focus on it pretty heavily in CA because it’s a big part of our history. Even though it’s US history, it’s not as integral to every state’s history so it may not have been focused on."
Met Bill Nighy and he was amazingly lovely. Shook my hand and offered to pose for a photo with no complaints at all :)
Are you attempting to use the getsileo repo? That method is no longer supported and the repo was taken down. If you want to use sileo you have to switch to odysseyra1n.

Urban armor gear pathfinder series. I just love their cases
"You seem to have an affinity for editors with the letter 'q' in their name XD

Notepadqq is the cross-platform version of Notepad++ isn't it? I loved N++ but switched to Geany for a more consistent experience between Windows and Linux. I hear good things about Nqq though :)"
Thanks you for your feedback! Ill be sure to check it out!
I hope you mean the one from Scarface
Awesome! I’m also a Cancer biologist (currently developing a novel therapy for multiple myeloma) will check your podcast out!
Is there a light version of him?
"I'm making notes of all of these for future travel.

A girl can dream."
I'll just stick with good old ginger tea with lemon and honey and nice daily walk outside. I don't think we humans need all that crap. People forgot how to prepare for winter
"Yeah, I drink 1-2 a day at work - usually the red Full Throttle, but lately it's been the various Mountain Dew Amped drinks, cause the local store has them on 2 for 1"
Are there any websites like codecademy that teach Go/golang? I hate python
"Synecdoche, New York - it starts to get recursive so similar to inception in that respect!"
No Sabbath from a UK magazine is truly embarrassing.
"As others have said, there's not really any reason to get hung up on which distribution you pick out for your first stab at Linux -- the main differences in distributions are:

* What are they based on?
* What package manager do they use?
* What packages do they come with?
* What are you looking to do with it?

For most end-users, just about any relatively modern distribution will be more than adequate to start with.  Pretty much all software is, in one way or another, usable on *most* distributions--though some make it easier than others, for sure.

Still, to get started, I'd recommend Ubuntu or one of its' derivatives:

* [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)
* [XUbuntu 18.04 LTS](https://xubuntu.org/download/)
* [LUbuntu 18.04 LTS](https://lubuntu.net/downloads/)
* [KUbuntu 18.04LTS](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/)
* [Ubuntu MATE 18.04.1 LTS](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/)
* [Linux Mint 19.1 LTS](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)

Ubuntu, and its derivatives are a pretty common recommendation for most new folks to Linux; both because a lot of the backend gets handled for you, and because there's such a huge plethora of documentation/forums/etc available already.  Each of the above distributions come with one Desktop Environment (or several options), but it should be noted that you can install whatever DE you wanted later and switch to it at any time, should you want to experiment:

* Ubuntu: [GNOME 3
](https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/)
* XUbuntu: [XFCE4](https://www.xfce.org/)
* LUbuntu 18.04: [LXDE
](https://lxde.org/)
* LUbuntu 18.10: [LXQt](https://lxqt.org/)
* KUbuntu: [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop)
* Ubuntu MATE: [MATE \(GNOME 2\)](https://mate-desktop.org/)
* Linux Mint: [Cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_\(software\)), MATE, XFCE4

Desktop Environments (and also Window Managers) are interchangeable on Linux, as is the case with just about everything else in the OS.  So if you start out with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and GNOME 3; but later decide you want to try XFCE4; you can just install it like any other piece of software...then when you wanna try it, you log into the desktop with that DE active -- and you're done.

So, as far as which DE to recommend...it largely comes down to personal preference.  As such, I'd recommend looking into the following to see which *you like the look/feel of*:

1. XFCE4 -- this is my preferred DE, if I use one at all
2. GNOME3 -- having used this in CentOS 7.x && Ubuntu 18.04, I'm pretty happy with it...even if it can be a little slow on limited hardware
3. Cinnamon -- this is about as close to the Windows environment as you'll get out of the box; which is one of the reasons Mint is recommended so often (though, not the only reason).

---

Personally, when I get to use Linux with a GUI (VMs only at work, sadly), I end up using the following:

* Arch or Manjaro
* No Desktop Environment
* Xorg + i3wm or i3-gaps
* Largely using terminal applications

I'm used to running Linux on my 2010 Toshiba Satellite A665-S6070; or VMs with a single CPU core and 2GB RAM or less...so I'm always about getting as much performance out of my hardware as possible, while also having the freedom to customize whatever I want.  Its not necessary, and I could definitely use any prebuilt distribution like a sane person...but what can I say; I always prefer to use Arch (or a derivative) on personal hardware.

Production, though, CentOS or Ubuntu Server as of late.  

---

I'd recommend just grabbing one of the above Ubuntu derivatives (or Ubuntu itself), installing it onto a VM, and seeing which DE you prefer.  Really though--just play around and have fun with it.  After the concept of interchangeable software sets in; it'll be no hassle changing your environment or distribution."
