Question is how to export Zebra sources to Sileo?

"Oooo really good advice, thank you!"
"That is the impression that I have gleaned, which is why I was trying to clarify. I wonder if any schools have moved up or down in the tiers?"
"the people bitching at this list have to realize that this is mostly compiled of NME's taste and not very much general consensus is relied upon here. a more acceptable list to criticize would be rolling stone's best of's, as they assemble a huge panel of different judges and still manage to have the most generic taste in a list possible. personally, i think pitchfork's best of lists are probably the least egregious, as it's very easy to see their list as their own and not just a stale, played out top 50 or 100 with the same five beatles or zeppelin albums.

(i think this list isn't good though, what's with the lack of black music in the top 10?)"
Anker Powercore 20100 has done me wonderfully for travel. Charges my devices quite fast as well.
"Yes, with the little bits of bean in it."

Oh yeah, I liked the idea but I found the storytelling really bad. Like they could have sold it much better !"
"1) Higurashi - My favorite anime psychological thriller. I loved the unique take on story telling. 

2)Death Note (till episode 26 I think)- L 

3) Mirai Niki - another really nice psychological thriller with some great wtf mind blown moments . 

4) Steins Gate - really nice narrative, a bit slow at first but it helps develop the characters which comes in handy when everything goes to shit.

5) Madoka Magika  - The series was really good but what really got me to love the series is the ever so controversial movie . 

6) Shinsekai Yori - Another unique psychological thriller set in a dystopic future . Loved the portrayal of the world and how society had evolved.

7) Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso - made me cry for the only other time besides when I watched violet evergarden episode 10. 

8) If I was to include a manga which will eventually be adapted into the 3rd and 4th season of it's anime then Nanatsu No Taizai - Escanor is my favorite anime/manga character of all time so there is no way I would miss out on mentioning him."
"Yes. I find I read more stories when they're all laid out on paper in front of me. 

Also, I find with the newspaper, I read a lot of articles I wouldn't have read otherwise."

"yea notepad++ is good and has a lot of features, but its also a little 2 loaded. and big. i like textpad instead."
"From what I gather, Brand new I would go with 1660ti just under $300 and the 5700 around $330-$370. 

I would make the push to go with the 5700 if possible. 

2060 is around 5700 price but 5700 seems to be much better. Unless you are going for raytracing, which the 2060 does have."
This is bullshit because the Judas Priest song is not Painkiller.
"I just resubscribed to the Financial Times last week, as I missed reading a paper in the morning. I also get The Week (not technically a newspaper) and I buy the Economist once a month (there is a little too much there to get through in a single week with everything else).

The fact that a broadsheet newspaper is so east to scan lots of stories fast, I read more quickly than I do online."
What are his political opinion? I love him as an actor. Just want to know his political views.
"Woman in 20s or 30s, satisfied with your career and where it's going. You like fragrances that err on the floral/woody/citrus side, so I would guess you like being outdoors. You like the soft/light/cottagecore aesthetic, and the more edgy, darker city life as well. I imagine you working in the city by day and travelling to a small cabin in the countryside on the weekends and tending a garden there and watching the sun set."

"I see Ruggable is already listed; I'll add Flor tiles. 

Chilewich - for placemats but also for custom-sized flooring that works great in an office (your chair wheels roll right over the flooring). 

Brooklinen and Snowe for bedding/towels. Can vouch for Snowe: very nice bedding for what you pay for. The Company Store is good as well. Snowe also has starter kits for dishes and glassware but haven't tried them out. They look nice though.

Casper and similar for mattresses. 

Online design services like Havenly (there's others, can't remember their names; have had good experience with Havenly). 

JC Penny for window treatments -- they will help you select, measure, install and all of that. (But Home Depot is best for cellular shades, though I know you said you aren't including them). 

AJ Madison for appliance reviews, specs, pricing. We ended up purchasing local for the service agreements, but this was a great resource for research.

I have a love-hate relationship with West Elm. If you like MCM and are looking for apartment-sized furniture, they can be a pretty good choice, but I'd want to test the furniture out in person. 

cableorganizer.com - lots of good advice and products. 

urbanoutfitters and anthropologie have some interesting decor. (got some throw pillows from urban outfitters)."
Why isn't none ever a choice? Just curious.

The birthday bit with Eeyore kind of reminds me of Maeda in [Cromartie High](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=361zil0iBUE#t=5m43s)
