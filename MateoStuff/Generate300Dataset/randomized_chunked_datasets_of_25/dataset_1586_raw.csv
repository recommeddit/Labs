"the biggest shortcoming is that VBA has lots of APIs to interact with other programs (e.g. SAP), Google apps script has none of that."
Coffee and cigarettes.
That scene at the end when he fights the other team's mascot... I laughed so hard. He turns from goofy pet detective guy to a UFC fighter in an instant. Straight comedy.
Fucking lol.
Brandon Sanderson infuses this adventure and epic feel to his books. Also Patrick Rothfuss with his kingkiller chronicles. It's just one big adventure. These two are my favourite authors after having read books from over 50 fantasy authors.
Oof that's gone through the old JPEG filter a couple times. Could do with a resync too.
Water dude. Half to two-third of the world uses it for ass-cleaning.
"Though it has to be director’s cut, imo"
Is it safe to link my bank account?
Oatmeal mixed with protein powder.
"Jiro Dreams of Sushi.

I did not expect to like it as well as I did, but it is captivating."
"Is the frame rate still smooth when gaming around 120 fps at 270hz with ULMB?

I find my games look sort of choppy at 120-130 fps at 144hz with ULMB.

I have a benq XL2730z and if the framerate isnt above 144hz it looks choppy with ULMB (especially in Apex Legends)"
That's why there is a saying that any monkey could have captained the WI and AUS teams of that respective era and had same results.
"I expected Mitchell to be pretty shy and awkward, so that's great."
Ooo Just Last Night is coming from the library soon!  Glad to hear you enjoyed it because I’ve DNFed a few of her books and am about to give up.
"Fantastic - Slum Village   
MM...Food - MF Doom"
"Basically all QB stats are heavily influenced by their team.  The personnel, the style of offense, the weapons they have, etc, etc.

There's a big difference between good stats and bad stats, but when 2 QB's are both putting up good stats, it's usually splitting hairs to claim one is measurably ahead of the other."
"Yes, that one affected me but ""Dear Zachary"" hurt my soul even more. Have you checked that one out?"
"I ordered the Otterbox asymmetry Series+ for my 13 Pro Max which has not yet arrived. The case arrived and the box has a sticker that says “iPhone 2021 X-Large and iPhone 12 Pro Max. It seems they put the sticker on the case being sold for the 12 Pro Max.

Given the thickness increase of the 13PM I wonder if this will fit properly or if I should return this case and find something else specifically designed for the 13PM."
"I think Kim. People who have worked with her always say how nice and respectful she is. Plus I think once she reached her 30s (especially after the Paris robbery) she's started thinking more about her life and legacy. The fact that she's so invested in becoming a lawyer and helping to abolish the death penalty and has started to really open her mind to thinking about other people besides the rich and famous shows that she's decent. I think Kim and her family all have moments when they are out of touch with the average person, but I get the sense that Kim is still in touch with humanity despite it all. Even when she messes up, I feel like her intention is always to do the right thing."
"Zinc gluconate (cold eeze). Take it at the first symptom and don't stop taking it until you feel like the cold has mostly gone away. 1 lozenge every 2-4 hours, eat right before you take the next one because they make food taste bad for up to 2 hours."
"I'm digging that new one, Polaris Blue.  Ill get a sample.  Thanks!"
"You actually don't really need to take that into consideration most of the time. If a plane has only one bin, job done. If you have two or three you load whichever one needs more weight first. Some planes are front heavy, so you fill the back bin, and put extra or gate checked bags in the front. You only really run into weight issues if you have a flight with like 5 bags. We use 50lb sand bags to add the needed weight."
"Not really, but it depends on what titles you're playing."
Can you give the link to the store?
