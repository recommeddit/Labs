Add Memento to this. Maybe Being John Malcovich and Adaptation?
mostly because they are expensive compared to other headphones and mobius are decent but are nowhere near as good as the competition.

There's probably a million more but I got bored."
yes they well
"you don't have to spend a cent - 3+ years every day for me, one  of the best games I've ever played"
Any full sized chocolate candy bar
"The twists were better in the books, but the movies built up the suspense well"
"As someone who works in a pharmacy, I agree wholeheartedly about the fucking meth-heads. We're pretty good at profiling now."
"No fracking anywhere near here (yet), but it's a pretty hot issue. The companies that have already bought up land are really fighting the locals on it. Many municipalities in the area have banned it or tried to ban it, but many of those are being contested in the courts at the moment.

Fortunately I don't own this property (I'm renting), so I'm not stuck with it if they do start fracking. But that doesn't mean I don't care about the issue."
That's messed up.
Why target?
"Goddamnit, you have scared me into flossing. I should probably go buy some floss."
"Played piano a bit when I was young for a few years. Hated it. Too slow reading notation and it frustrated me. Played guitar when I was a teenager and bass and drums in my twenties.

So knew the basics. Chords were easy. So got my family piano from the old folks, moved it into the instrument room and started using my old guitar songs with the chords on it. I knew the basic shape of a chord so going back to piano was easy. Now I love the piano. 

Finding a way to play your instrument which makes learning/playing easy for you. For me it's finger/chord shapes and runs. I'm pleased my folks made me play piano (even though I hated it at the time) when I was 8 yrs old. It really laid a solid base for music knowledge with other instruments."
My hands are about medium size
"That's how this sub is when there's a question like this. God forbid you mention Bernie Sanders here, as you've probably already seen. Downvotes are for wrong answers or misleading info, not for subjective disagreement. I dislike Rand Paul's politics, for example, but I'm not going to downvote someone who thinks he's the cat's pajamas.

(That's two things that'll probably get me downvoted. I forgive you who do that.)"
"Yepp. FWIW, I also went to USC for engineering grad school and had a great time. The Trojan Network is definitely awesome. Personally, I'm leaning towards UCLA for business school since I already have the USC network and because it's impossible to get into Stanford or Berkeley. XD"
How does the Azzaro perform?
"The movie is good, but you should check out the short story it's based on by Heinlein: ""—All You Zombies—""

Here's a pdf of it: https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Robert-A.-Heinlein-All-You-Zombies.pdf"
I had no idea! Makes sense then.
">Kind of an interesting intersection with that and this quote I picked up from Dune, which I finally read recently: ""A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.""

I really like that quote. I feel like it's something everyone should try to remind themselves of, because when you are an individual, you *are* ***your*** leader."
"Here's the thing--all the rankings could be more accurately replaced with US News' academic reputation ranking. But you have to pay to unlock that/buy the magazine to see it, so instead everyone relies on a weird methodology that doesn't quite work to dream up the prestige of different colleges."
