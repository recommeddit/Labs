Gin and lemonade?

"Never download apps directly from a 3rd party site - download from the official developer site or the Mac App Store.

Mac Update bundles malware (since 2015):

Mac Update also got hacked and distributed someone elses malware (2018-02):

You should also be somewhat vary of apps that require an installer and that asks for your **password**. This is a common tactic used by malware to get access to OS ""plugin"" (filesystem) locations and system settings. **Most** legitimate apps have no need for this."
Always.
"I always feel these lists would be better if they were in ""no particular order"", as in these are what we consider the 500 best albums. When they rank the top 500 it gets silly, I find it hard believe anyone on earth thinks Amy Winehouse's Back to Black is a more worthy album  than Abbey Road or Suedes's  Dog Man Star is better than Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks."
Ouroboros!
I much preferred A Deepness in the Sky to A fire Upon the Deep. Maybe because I read it first? >!I was super-invested in Pham after having read **Deepness** and how his story played out in **A Fire Upon the Deep** really bummed me out.!<
Guys... should we tell 'em?
"I love DMC. But as a movie Curse is almost perfect. I would put it slightly below Raiders. Behind all the fun, the script is an excellent one."
"I love the sounds of a telecasters neck pickup. Just the right amount of fat-ness but still has a sharp, bell-like clarity."
"Ricardo Pereira is injured, and Nelson Semedo is much better than people give him credit for"
"Disagree. If you’re just testing the waters, don’t bother with a camera. If you decide you like streaming, don’t waste money on a 270 and get a 920/922 later. Just get the 920/922 first and be done with it. It’s still a budget camera, it’s not expensive at all and it can be found on sale often. The quality is also a LOT better than the 270. Not talking about pixels, but colors and the way it handles light are all much better. Besides you can use a webcam for more than just streaming."
Seeing stuff like this gives me hope for humanity.
"Hg/SS are my favorite, has my favorite starter and Pokemon typhlosion. I like the cultural look they gave the buildings and I like how team rocket is trying to rebuild, and the Kanto post game has got to be the best postgame ever

Gen3 is my least favorite and honestly all the water and surfing was too much, it has the least amount of favorable Pokemon out of all the gens, ""I want more water!"" "" I want more land"" idea for the evil team is kind of stupid, I don't like 51/2  out of 8 of the legendaries

I don't count the lets go games otherwise they would be least favorite because I don't like the game play"
"You know that closed fist scribble toddlers do with paintbrushes? That, but on your teeth."
"Chief keef, Danny Brown  (attak is my fave for lifting), flume, Gucci, brodinski, migos, metallica, schoolboy q"
"So if one desires whiter teeth but doesn't want to wear down their enamel with abrasives, would you recommend getting teeth bleached?"
"Dental assistant here.... TOO MANY BOXES OF TOOTH PASTE, TOOTHBRUSHES AND MOUTHWASH. every week, its ridiculous."
"I always go with lowes. HQ is in my home state, and lowes fired my mother-in-law. I also only shop at Harris teeter, academy, harbor freight, staples because they fired her as well"
"I tend to do this because I don't like sitting around. Ultimately, at the end of the day, it makes me feel a lot worse."
"Reverse osmosis. It's a 5-stage filter system with a reverse-osmosis membrane in there to get just about anything that isn't pure H2O out of the mix. 

The whole system is about 200 bucks to install. The carbon block and poly filters are cheap, they cost 30 bucks or so every 6 months. The membrane costs 70 bucks and lasts about 3 years for a normal family using it just for drinking water, so long as you remember to replace the carbon and poly filters regularly."
Also What's The Difference.  Hottest brass I've ever heard.
Still the best franchise on IOS after all this time
"Marijuana. Clears out the sinuses, makes you feel better/no headach. If your throat hurts you can take it in a tea form, with some honey. Had a cold a few weeks ago, coming in on a friday morning, and gone by sunday."
"I'm interested in pandemic - is a 7yr old going to get it?  She has a fair bit of board game experience - kingdomino, wingspan, camel up, sushi go, machi koro"
