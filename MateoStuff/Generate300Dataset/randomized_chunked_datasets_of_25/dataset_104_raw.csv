"It depends what you mean by difficult....

If you mean the most difficult to become a professional in, one would have to say piano or violin as, like someone commented on this post before, the fields of both those instruments are so over-saturated. 

One could say that piano is the easiest to start learning, as it is not difficult to make a sound. In the long run, piano gets a lot more difficult! 
What I usually think of the main woodwinds is (and don’t hate me guys!!) in terms of ease to play or to just get a sound
saxophone > flute > clarinet > oboe > bassoon 
However saying this, I know people who have made sounds on bassoon/oboe first try and haven’t been able to make any sound on clarinet for months. Honorary mention to bass clarinet! Difficult. 

I have also heard that organ is particularly tricky, and french horn"

"I loved this one! Checked it out because of Lawrence Fishburne, as he’s just always great. Ended up being really impressed by everyone involved!"
I like listening to Flogging Molly while doing cardio.
you get over it by the second time you come home and are greeted by a prepared hot meal that tastes as good as it smells... i just pretend casper the friendly ghost is my private chef.
Thx for sharing!
"Depends on what you’re looking for. 

If you want to be close to campus the chi-5 (Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, San Nic, and San Mig) are the way to go. If distance isn’t an issue then FT and Manzinita are an option for you. 

If you’re looking for triples all the chi-5 have them. FT has doubles and triples (I believe? But a lot of doubles I think). San Miguel and San Nic also have doubles. The shorties (Anacapa, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz) only have triples.

Some of the shorties have a nice ocean view, depending on which side you choose. The towers (San Nic and San Mig) have a lagoon view but it depends on which side you choose.

The shorties are 2 floors and the towers are 8 floors. 

The best dining commons from the most popular opinion is probably: Carrillo > DLG > Ortega > Portola or Carrillo > Ortega > DLG > Portola. 

The towers and shorties are close to both DLG and Ortega. Carrillo is a bit far from the chi-5, it’s closest to Manzi. FT has Portola. 

Personally, as a person that lives in San Mig, Ortega is my number 1 because of its specialty bars like waffle night, ice cream bar, curly fry bar, etc...

I think socially all dorms are pretty active except for probably manzi (because a lot of 2nd years and up are probably living there and already have their groups). 

Santa Cruz has a theater and their color scheme is whacky but nice imo. Santa Rosa is a bit older and the color scheme may seem a bit dull but they have a small fitness room. Anacapa has a somewhat brighter color scheme (sorry I don’t know much about Anacapa or the shorties aside from their color scheme). San Mig has a small fitness room too but the color scheme may be a bit dull. There’s also a thing about San mig having janky elevators but I haven’t had that much of a problem with the elevators. Sometimes one side is closed but I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. The only time it was bad was during the Thomas fire and people had to walk up to their floor. I’m not so sure about San Nic but I know students from FSSP stay there. 

I hope this helps and gives you some insight into the dorms! I know I was pretty stressed when choosing a dorm so if you have any other questions feel free to ask!"
I was just pointing out there are better Rocky songs than the typical Tiger song. Distance is a great song.

"Yea, it’s really good, but they need to add more to the game like more roles. Or at least new items or rooms."
Are cases are usually useless except for the phone they made. My iPhone X case won’t work with my iPhone 12 mini but I don’t expect it to
"Do it! I was iffy about show initially, but it really draws you in by Season 2. Wonderful, feel-good show."
It's not that it's about Man Utd... That team just doesn't compare to plenty others. I can think of atleast 20 teams that were better.
"yeah I think I  have a theory on why my top left corner of the pad doesn't want to grip but I do not know if that could possible play a factor 

Theory: so When I first got the mouse pad there was a bunch of papers on my desk and I think I accidently placed my pad over that stack of paper. That  paper stack was so high it lifted that corner up exposing it to air causing drying.

But I don't know if this could possibly play a factor to it This is my first time picking up anything other than a cloth pad. Also any tricks or tips on how to make that side 'grippy' or ‘sticky’ again. Its honestly not much of a problem it just bugs me a lot  but I don’t notice it in everyday use, the pad is fine. Thanks for reading!"
"I would test with another device to see if your router is working. Otherwise, you can replace the WiFi card. Nothing much can be done about backlight bleed, unfortunately."

"The only egregious thing about this list is Iron Man 3 being so low. The most consistently underrated MCU film, I'd say. But that's okay, it reflects a widely shared sentiment, I guess.

But for the rest, yeah, it's about what you'd expect (okay, I'd have expected IW to be higher)."
This for sure. We got some fairly cheap photography lights off amazon and they're amazing. So many people look like they're playing in a cave by candlelight.
I was just going to say that
"With torrents your main concern is getting a copyright infringement notice.

It comes in the mail and yes ...

I had two with windscribe :'( 

Nord is probably good, but I prefer cyberghost because they don't have one centralized login. That would make it easy to tie activity to an account in an SQL table"
