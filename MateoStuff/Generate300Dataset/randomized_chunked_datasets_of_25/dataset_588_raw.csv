"Eau My by George Takei or Invictus by Paco Rabanne. 

Eau My is unisex and Invictus is for men technically but I get a ton of compliments on it."
I have a pretty dope lemon tree in my bathtub!
"LLbean ridge runner. It holds my 17"" HP, it failed after 3 years (zipper broke) took it back and got it replaced. It'll also hold 12 pounders easily. Be weary of messenger bags they can really fuck your shoulder up if you only use one shoulder."
"Mango trees.    
Growing up, they were the best for climbing."
"Basic sql to query. 

Basic table and view design to store. 

Basic denormalization to store intelligently. 

Mvc pattern for organizing your front end. 

Unit testing if your Web app is a commercial endeavor. You need to prove your stuff works so your  customers don't suffer. 

Javascript up the wazoo for manipulating the interface. 

Edit: I can expand on any of this if you like, I'm on mobile right now and typing industry words is a pain with autocorrect thwarting my every turn. 

Whatever floats your boat in between. 

Proper repository and deployment practices so you are employable by larger firms. They don't employ production cowboys for long."
"Sunscreen.

No skin cancer for me"
I don't drink any of them because it's terrible for the environment and my suggestion would be that you don't as well ðŸ™‚
"""You smell amazing! What is that smell?""

""It's the smell of fresh sea with a slight hint of roofies."""
Laughs in Flint.
"That area is very well covered by all 3 carriers (TM/AT/VZ). The trouble is that there will always be pockets where coverage is poor; or just the tower near you whose antennas are poorly aligned or overloaded at specific times. There is no way for anyone to know which carrier will work all the time. If you are really suffering, you might want to try T-Mobile first. Verizon has a wide network but they are not the fastest and they depri a lot more."
The orer is pretty bad. Is this it is not a top 20 albums
"You should be able to just whitelist an entire site, literally a few clicks, one time."
"Worst sounding instrument?

Two oboes playing in unison."
"You should enable toe input, then you have upto 20 digits to input with...though still short of the required 9,999,999 digits required."
Repo for zebra?
"Came into this thread hoping some people would say piano. A lot less than I expected, but still some nonetheless. There's still hope!"
I'm getting a hint of Scrappy with a mild after taste of gym-ratty. Fortunately I carried that delicacy in my lunch pail.
"> If you've never read anything on the Civil War - start with April 1865: The Month That Saved America by Jay Winik.

I'm not saying that book isn't wonderful but to start learning about the Civil War starting with the last few months of the conflict seems to be the wrong way of going about it."
"Mad max fury road has set the bar pretty high for recent action. Like 90% of that movie was real, it's mind boggling."
"Iâ€™ve had both a symmetry and defender. The defender was the one that survived the longest, heck that case is still in use by the person I gave it to. 

The symmetry is a bit more like other readily available cases but it does feel very nice in the hand and provides good protection."
"I prefer to stick with major American brands because parts are readily available. I've heard with LG and Samsung it can be hard to get parts or they're expensive; either way you will almost always have to wait for shipping; Where as there are GE parts stores all over the place. I've done a few DIY repairs on Whirlpool and GE refrigerators (from YouTube instructions), and they were all pretty easy. It's probably best to get the most popular models, so the parts will likely be more widely distributed."
"Lamely going by [top 3 highest salary](http://money.cnn.com/gallery/pf/2012/11/01/top-paying-jobs/3.html) medians:

Neurosurgeon - $368,000

Petroleum engineering - $162,000

Nurse anesthetist - $159,000

Although I couldn't imagine doing a medical job unless you are both highly intelligent and feel like it's your calling."
"Peter Mayhew!  We went to a con in Florida he was at, I was so excited because seriously, Chewbacca was one of my favorite characters. I had an old Chewbacca t-shirt I'd gotten when Empire Strikes Back came out (so, 1985 or thereabouts? and it was 2005 or 2006 at the time) and he was doing autographs. I asked the person handling that if I could buy a pic but have him sign the shirt instead, and the guy was all ""No, no way, has to be the picture!""  Mr. Mayhew overheard this, waved me over (he wasn't very busy at all, sadly), said ""I haven't seen one of these shirts in YEARS!"" signed the shirt, signed my photo as well, and then sat and talked to me and my husband for a few minutes, during which time he ate half a brownie and then OFFERED ME THE OTHER HALF OF IT, saying his wife had baked it but ""I'm trying to cut down and it's too much"".  We talked about pantomime and old silent films, because I had started out with how much I loved the character he played even tho Chewbacca obviously didn't speak common, he was still incredibly expressive and completely understandable. And he said that he had been inspired by knowing a Deaf person and by early silent movies in that.
I had stars in my eyes that day and for a long time after, he was just such a super sweet, nice guy."
