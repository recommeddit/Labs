3072,"The front facing camera on smartphones do have a better sensor and lens than most webcams, **but that is not the whole story.**

Video and photos on a smartphone go through a ton of **real time software processing** in order to look that good. A ton of uncompressed raw data is sent directly from the camera sensor straight to the phone's SOC to be processed. I am talking about **several gigabits per second.** Way too much for USB 2 or even USB 3. USB 3.2 10Gbps might be able to handle that.

Compare this to a webcam. The sensor captures the image and then a **super cheap processor** in the webcam handles all the image processing and compression before the video feed is sent over USB2 to the PC.

In theory, you can make a webcam that basically has a smartphone SOC inside it that does all the sophisticated image processing that smartphone cameras can do. However, once you do that, the price of the webcam ballons quickly. Once a webcam costs $300+, it is tough to justify compared to something like a cheap used DSLR.

People seem to forget that USB webcams were a dying product category pre-COVID. No one gave a sh** about them for about a decade after every laptop and phone started coming with built in cameras.",best webcamera

46836,"Soap and water work well if you actually have stuff on your hands - dirt, grime, fecal matter, that kind of stuff. There's a good chance simply removing that crap from your hands in a third-world country would improve things. Soap helps do this better than water alone. 

With otherwise clean hands, however, soap and water only shows a ~1.5 log reduction in bacterial counts, which is pretty poor. Ethanol based hand sanitizers (60-95%) work significantly better than this. So... you're still wrong.

Edit: btw, I think the article I referenced is available for free online at pubmed. It's a thick volume so you probably won't be interested in reading all of it, but there is a ton of good information in there.",best hand santizer brand

22010,"Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame.

Tall as fuck, and really cheerful. I was working the front desk for Newbury Comics' corporate office and he and his assistant came in. I didn't even process the name when his assistant said it, just called back to the buyer whom Bruce was meeting. Then it hit me: ""Wait. **The** Bruce Campbell""?

Bruce is standing to my right, looming like death. He smiles, extends a hand, laughs, and asks me my name. I made the requisite boomstick joke, and he also laughed at that.
