7231,best iPhone,"At this current point I would suggest at least an iPhone 11. You can get it for only $100 more than the XR on the Apple Store and itâ€™s probably better in almost every way. Keep in mind that the XR phone is getting close to 3 years old, so something newer is probably the better choice"
5014,best home improvement store,"Mine gave me something like 15% off ten years ago. They also allowed me buy a whole pallet of quikrete (56 bags at 80lbs per bag!) at the contractor rate, and then let me return the unused bags."
53769,best medicine for a cold,-hot water - lemon juice + more rum
51975,best iphone case,Do you find that that case provides enough lip to protect the screen? How is the camera lens protection?
43701,best items under $100,"Wait a second, it's a port of #2?

...

THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING."
59804,best perfume,This is the only scent I've personally bought a full-sized bottle of and used up completely. Every other perfume I have lingers for decades on my shelf. Light Blue is the best and I would always get compliments when I wore it!
58541,best cologne,Joop Homme. Mmmmm yes.
53953,best medicine for a cold,andrographis + echinacea + epicor + zinc gluconate = ðŸ’¯
22656,best celebrity,"Oddly cool:  Bill Gates.

He stood in line like everyone else, and made the poor counter girl do a double take when she grabbed his card.  Even tipped well."
70451,best major to study in college,"Or when some people say that the only jobs you can get with a degree in Mathematics is a teacher.

Also when they ask what specific job you want when there are so many jobs and so many different fields of mathematics that it's close to impossible to know what you'll end up doing."
10848,best suitcase lock,This is the real lpt right here.
56706,best desktop monitor,"I have [this desk](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0634/2349/products/20140917141525_ZL7500-01MD_Bentwood_Main_Desk_1024x1024.jpg?v=1416876112) and although it's pretty sturdy, it'll still shake when I bump it with my chair's arm rests. It's not a violent or worrysome shake, but if I'm reading something on the screen, it's enough to mess with you eyes pretty good."
46225,best trick or treating candy,I LOVE the mango ones.
29963,best money managing app,"I have had a great time with [Buxfer,](https://www.buxfer.com/) I started on their free plan and eventually moved up to one of their paid ones. but even still it's been so simple and easy to use. It has made such a difference."
51748,best iphone case,"Iâ€™ve only ever used one for an xs and it was amazing. Iâ€™d say the Saddleback leather iPhone cases are the top tier. The toughest and highest quality boot leather, and hand made by artisans the old school way. You will get TONS of compliments on it if you buy one. With how expensive they are though Iâ€™d honestly only buy if you plan on keeping that 12 for like 3+ years."
60621,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Fair enough, I couldn't handle all the extra narration on the second one they needed to fill the gaps. Try watching the first one again. You'll see things right from the go and it may be more interesting. Either way, love the show."
44615,best items under $100,"Itâ€™s kinda specific, but a wet pallet does wonders if you do acrylic painting (This includes miniature painting). Also a heat pad or electric blanket is amazing for those cold days/nights."
66783,best soccer team in the world,It should have been us :(
28521,best breakfast foods,Grilled ham and cheese sandwich with an egg cooked overeasy in the middle.
73628,best battery bank,"Right - but for a pixel, it needs PD. Or it's a complete crap shoot. Understand what you're saying though, not disagreeing with that data point, and stand corrected on that piece."
41840,movies like Inception,You've just blown my mind with your crazy 3am trippy chat.
1037,best ice cream flavor,"Coffee flavored ice cream, coffee beans in ice cream, or coffee on ice cream?"
40057,best Chrome extensions,"Based on the extensions in this list, this looks more like a guide useful for people trying to tackle their ADD with being OCD (except for the uBlock Origin tip, that one is really useful for everyone)"
46478,best trick or treating candy,"As a South Carolinian, I must agree. I don't know anyone who ever actually wanted Milk Duds. Also, where are the Twix on this map?!"
15898,best sunglasses for fashion,"Same here - I've never had other high end glasses, though, so I'm not sure how they compare."
