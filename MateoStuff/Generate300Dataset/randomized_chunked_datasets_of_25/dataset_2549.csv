54041,best medicine for a cold,"Paracetamol - Only if I'm in pain

Any decongestant - If I have a runny nose

And my special flu drink: 3/4 Glass of warm water. 1/6 Glass of honey. 1 Lemon - squeeze the pulp out into the drink. Garlic - chop finely and crush into drink.

Drink this once when you wake up and right before bed. Eat the garlic, the honey takes the edge off it. This not only fights the cold, it also soothes your throat and prevents the cold from getting worse. 

I would personally recommend this everyday and not only when you have a cold."

73605,best battery bank,Thanks! I was always confused about how to figure out the limit.
42237,movies like Inception,Only logical considering it's the movie Nolan got the ideas for Inception from.
23372,best car racing video game,"I finished it, it's a great blast from the past if you enjoyed the old ones."
7100,best iPhone,The 11/XR strike an excellent balance with the size. It’s bigger than the plus size screens but smaller overall because of the bezel and chin reduction. I’d say go for the 11 and use the extra money you save to get either Apple Watch or AirPods.
6295,best Netflix documentary,When hero's fly ......crap name but excellent Israeli thriller
16718,best pet for toddlers,"Yes, but they are so amazing with children & easy to train."
13151,best gifts for mom,Sweet.
68034,best science fiction novel,"Was waiting for someone to mention Banks. Between him and Neal Asher, their work has really influenced my own sci-fi universe."
37907,best Marvel movie,"I swear to god, I see this post everyday."
25658,best cricket teams of all time,"Nah, he coasted on Waugh's coat tails for the early stages and when everyone retired at once (something that should have been planned for but clearly wasn't), he wasn't able to do much at all. He had some great patches with the bat afterwards but Ponting didn't come close to Border, Taylor or Waugh (or Clarke as it turns out) and I think he was never the same player again after he became captain. 

I've been regularly accused of being a Ponting hater though (even though he is one of my all time favourite players)."
16614,best pet for toddlers,Fish. No big deal when they lose interest.
42879,best detective show,"yes! i highly recommend DarK! even if it is a sci-fi series, it has the same thrill i get while watching true crime/drama shows, and it has the best plot twsts i've seen in any show. each episode left me mind-blown every time. 

i also love Ozark and Orphan Black (and Mindhunter, but everyone else said that too hahah)"
56922,best water brand,Isklar or Imsdal. Also water with a lot of calcium is wonderful provided it is clean.
23367,best car racing video game,On a wheel how is it compared to grid and forza horizon? Because both of those are enjoyable on a wheel for me (although they play better as controller games imo). But if it's like a NFS game...I ..I can't. Oh God.
59463,best perfume,"I'm over here taking notes and adding to my to-sample list.  Definitely got to get a Hendley discovery set and a sample of Noir Anthracite and Wolf Spirit, they sound up my alley.  What's Fleurs de Citronnier like?  I loooove actual lemon blossoms, but I never seem to find lemon blossom perfumes that do them justice.

 I actually just gave my sample of Tucson a second try the other day and found it lovely.  Reminds me of hiking in the mountains with my grandpa. Carosello is also super interesting."
6781,best iPhone,Definitely the 7 Plus. Battery lasted all day no problem and then some.
55352,best action and adventure novel series,"For fun, adventurey adventure stories, [Kidnapped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_(novel) or [Treasure Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island), both by Robert Louis Stevenson, are fantastic and easy to read. For something with a bit more bite, Raphael Sabatini's [Scaramouche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaramouche_(novel) (""He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad, and this was his only inheritance,"" and all that) or [Captain Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Blood_(novel). Both seem to fit pretty well with what you list in your request. H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, Jules Verne, and Jack London all would come up in a complete list of the best and most famous adventure novelists, as well. 

If you wouldn't mind some early ""spy"" fiction, John Buchan's [Richard Hannay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hannay) books walk the line between spy and adventure novels.

For something that skews somewhat heavier, it's hard to go wrong with Conrad when you are looking for adventure. [Lord Jim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Jim) is powerful, and [Nostromo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostromo) is unbelievably good and shamefully overlooked due to the common use in class and corresponding (undeserved) unpopularity of *Heart of Darkness*, though *Nostromo* is more ""historical"" fiction than adventure.

Sorry this post got so long, but I hope it helps!"
73353,best battery bank,Anchors are too heavy for my trips but I can see the appeal of getting a workout in
61759,Best RPG game on PS4,"I don't remember UC4 having any branching dialog? Just scripted sequences related to the set piece. 

> You can have a full magic build, full tank build, full dexterity build. And these aren't the only ways you can build your character in Dark Souls, you can have varying combinations of weapons and magic depending on how you allocate your stats. Dark Souls is definitely an RPG.

To reply to this specifically, unless you consider role playing a spreadsheet role playing, thats not an RPG. Dark Souls, Bloodbourne, Diablo, Rise of the Tomb Raider all have stats and different variations in character builds that will change how you approach the game play. But none have branching dialog. None have variations in quests. None have changes in the player's approach to NPCs. Regardless of how the player builds their character, the story and progression of each of those games will play out exactly the same way each and every time you play them. 

Compare that to a game like Pillars of Eternity. The player character has the usual skills and item stats, but also character specific backgrounds. These backgrounds come up in dialog, opening up unique options and paths, and solutions that wouldn't be available to a character that didn't have that trait. If the player pursues one path, it closes off other paths. If the player pursues an evil path, it closes off quests and spoils relations both party members and factions in the game world. Completing or ignoring party member quests, even the dialog choices chosen effect and change your role towards that party member. Witcher 3's dialog may be simpler, but Geralt is still a role for the player, and while its mostly predefined, the player still has a wide latitude in how they approach situations. Witcher 3 has a wide range of possible outcomes and results based on the players actions. 

I am not saying any of these games are bad, I thoroughly enjoyed Uncharted 4, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. I have both Lost Legacy and Frozen Wilds on preorder, and eagerly anticipate playing them. They just aren't RPGs unless your definition of an RPG is . . . extremely loose."

28211,best breakfast foods,"I didn't see this when it was down voted, but I'd guess ""pound a protein shake""."
33832,best Pokemon game,"I’m going to suggest emerald and platinum.
Emerald has some would say too much content which I find great and platinum is in my opinion the best, gem four is really good and I hope they get remakes"
