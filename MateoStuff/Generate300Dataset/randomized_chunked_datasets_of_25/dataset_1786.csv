56622,"I’m same spot as you but currently have a 1080p 144hz. Looking at the same monitors too. 

First off, get the Acer version of that ASUS monitor if you do. It’s the XB271 or something. Same panel but a lot of people say better QC. 

I’d recommend either IPS unless budget is a big constraint. Honestly I don’t know if I’d care IPS vs TN, but if I got the TN I’d always wonder how much IPS would be better. You’ll be looking at it every single time you use your PC so get one you love. I’m considering the UW because 120hz vs 144hz isn’t enough for me to care, and it’ll give me extra screen space for coding/school work. If you’re just gaming, then it’s up to you if $300 extra is worth it for the UW 

Also a store near me has RL on the Acer 1440p IPS UW and it looks amazing.",best desktop monitor
56894,"I've become kind of a jerk about water. I will drink pretty much anything sparking, so cheap ol' seltzer for .50 a liter will do just fine. On the other hand, I like all sorts of (to me) strange mineral waters. I grew up in a town famed for its mineral springs, so I like all the high-mineral, salty-tasting waters. My favorite one right now is called Borsec, from Romania. I've only had one water ever that was too salty for me, and it was from the same Russian store I get the Borsec from, but I can't remember its name. I'd love to tell you all what it's called, so you can avoid it in the future.",best water brand

46743,"Hate to be the contrarian here, but the extremely trace amounts of methanol you can find in ethanol based sanitizers are a literal non-issue. We’re talking a fraction of a mL present per bottle, basically what couldn’t be separated during the distillation process. You need to INGEST ~10mL of methanol for nerve damage to occur. Experts even agree these days that generally it’s not even worth removing the small doses from moonshine. You have to consume copious amounts of alcohol to get a toxic dose. 

Are you drinking hand sanitizer? No? You’re fine. This is the last thing you should ever worry about in a SHTF scenario. Just don’t drink your hand sanitizer.",best hand santizer brand

12601,"When I was around 17 my room was a disaster. My mom always wanted it clean but I never would really get around to it. The night before mother's day I got home from work and just started cleaning my room. It took hours. When I was done I stuck a note on my door that said ""Happy Freaking Mother's day"" and went to bed. When I woke up the next afternoon my mom was so happy.
