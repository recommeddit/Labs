50891,best rap album,"Gotta be Illmatic. It's flawless from front to back, like even the intro track is probably the best intro track on any album ever, NY State of mind is one of the best rap songs ever, as are Represent, One Love, The World Is Yours, etc. 

Every time I listen to the album I have a different favorite song on it. That's a sign of a great album."
39510,best web browser,"Good post!  I did want to put out a few corrections because not everything on this list is privacy friendly.

Brave - They're an ad company with a browser that essentially bribes people to use it with their own cryptocurrency BAT, [which you can't actually cash out](https://old.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/csdtr8/the_tokens_are_not_refundable_and_are_not/).  There's a bunch of other things ""wrong"" with it, but that's for another post.

Vivaldi -  They're a closed source browser.  They say they're open source but you can't view all their code and you definitely can't build from source. With a plethora of open source browsers in different engines, there's no reason to take a chance on a closed source one.

Esocia - [I made a post all about them fairly recently](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/cvhfyw/noble_goals_but_ecosia_falls_short_in_their) over in /r/privacy.  Escosia was actually tagged in one of the comments but never came around to correct or defend anything, so I assume everything I said was accurate.

Everything else looks good though!  Some people will poop all over some of those options, but they are still very valid options regardless of how popular they are.  Thanks for spreading the information!"

42598,best detective show,"Thanks for this recommendation! What a fantastic show. 

I’m surprised how emotionally charged the last season is or maybe it was just my reaction. 

I love Anderson’s character... such a strong female lead. The writing, her lines especially, are so profound."

* Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu  

* The Story Of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang  

* Veniss Underground by Jeff Vandermeer  

* The Solar Cycle by Gene Wolfe (though calling the entire thing science fiction is probably enough of a stretch that it's an outright lie)

19232,best YouTube video,"Ferrets are very communal. She perceives her human as another ferret in the ‘group’. It’s sweet that they are so well bonded. She might be the lone ferret in the house, because she would likely act like this with another ferret. ‘LOOK AT MY BABIES!!”

She also looks like my Ginger, who keeps stuffed babies under the couch and feeds them treats. It’s so cute."

27990,best breakfast foods,Microwaving it is the best way. So when it's finished the cheese gets all chewy and greasy. I was also a cold pizza guy before I watched that episode of The Sopranos where the priest came to Carmela's house. Now I'm completely for microwaving it.
