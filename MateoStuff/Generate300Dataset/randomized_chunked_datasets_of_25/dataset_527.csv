Brave - They're an ad company with a browser that essentially bribes people to use it with their own cryptocurrency BAT, [which you can't actually cash out](https://old.reddit.com/r/brave_browser/comments/csdtr8/the_tokens_are_not_refundable_and_are_not/).  There's a bunch of other things ""wrong"" with it, but that's for another post.

Vivaldi -  They're a closed source browser.  They say they're open source but you can't view all their code and you definitely can't build from source. With a plethora of open source browsers in different engines, there's no reason to take a chance on a closed source one.

Esocia - [I made a post all about them fairly recently](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/cvhfyw/noble_goals_but_ecosia_falls_short_in_their) over in /r/privacy.  Escosia was actually tagged in one of the comments but never came around to correct or defend anything, so I assume everything I said was accurate.

Everything else looks good though!  Some people will poop all over some of those options, but they are still very valid options regardless of how popular they are.  Thanks for spreading the information!",best web browser
