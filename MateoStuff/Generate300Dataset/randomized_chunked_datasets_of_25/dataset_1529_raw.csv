"I LOVED Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, too bad they didnâ€™t continue that spinoff"
Sadly Nintendo games almost never drop in price
"Tom Holland is most definitely the best Peter/Spider-Man we've ever had and i hope Sony doesn't do something stupid like not extending the deal they have with marvel. I feel like Tom is perfect for the role but the fact that he's in the MCU now really helps too.

Having said that, Tobey and Andrew both did a good job in their movies despite not every movie being as good."
"That's how I read it the first time, too.  

I put the bacon in a cold oven, set it to convect bake at 400 degrees.  This gives me 25 minutes total to shower, shave, and get dressed.  That's plenty."
Methanol is toxic on skin? I did **not** know that. Before all this went down I used to get 99% isporopyl alcohol for $3.00 for 16 oz. I'm glad I grabbed it out of habit. The price is double for 50% alcohol now. A place by me sells 32 oz 99% for 9 bucks. You **know** I racked up.
Love Sanjay!
Iâ€™ve heard that but think I didnâ€™t give the third enough of a chance after the second. I might just have to reread ðŸ¤”

Happy to elaborate if anyone is curious!"
"If you want good puzzle games, I **very, very much** recommend the Professor Layton trilogy. They are great ports of a classic DS series full of puzzles challenging enough to keep you engaged, and a lovable, memorable cast of characters."
Thank you for the feedback! I took Im\_That\_Guy21's advice to do an intro episode on my work in B-cells and lymphomas and published it tonight ([https://open.spotify.com/show/6KySzlxOJT2blYQbiMoPa2](https://open.spotify.com/show/6KySzlxOJT2blYQbiMoPa2)) ([https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/for-whom-the-cell-tolls/id1439942541](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/for-whom-the-cell-tolls/id1439942541)). I'll try and answer some of the questions and would love to continue discussing. I'll post when new episodes are published. Thank you for listening!
Oh my God! Fragonard Eclat! I was torn to choose either this or Etoile because both were so good! I ended up with Etoile and it is in my Hall of Fame!

"[lf](http://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gokcehan). It's super fast, I like the client-server model (e.g. I can copy-paste files between different instances of lf), and it's easy to customize with just shell script."
My guess would be more people have gone out of their way to ride Desperado.
"My sister and I got our mom a year of the NPR Wine Club because she likes 2 things- NPR and alcohol (she's a public school teacher, it comes with the territory).

&#x200B;

Best gift ever. Each wine had a little booklet about how it was made, the profits went to NPR, and they had special bottles named after NPR show (we turned the All Grapes Considered into a vase). She loved it, especially how the survey you filled out at the end of the term adjusted what wines they would send each quarter.

Honestly don't know how we can top it this Christmas."

Axios is great. Fetch isnâ€™t bad either but it doesnâ€™t error/reject on 400+ which annoys me.

"I usually buy furniture and decorations on these sites: [Rove Concepts](http://roveconcepts.com/), [Manhattan Home Design](http://manhattanhomedesign.com/), [1st Dibs](http://1stdibs.com/), [Amazon](http://amazon.com/), [eBay](http://ebay.com/), [Barcelona Designs,](http://barcelona-designs.com/) [Vidrian Glass | Stained Glass Art & Interior Design](http://vidrianglass.com/), Burrow, The inside, [Blu Dot](https://www.bludot.com/),  [CB2](https://www.cb2.com/), etc. I also like to check on places like Houzz and Apartment Therapy, because I have found unique and great price stuff recommendations there. Most of the times I kind of don't pay attention to stores but the quality of the product. Nice thread!"
"OneTab! It consolidates tabs for you, sorted by windows. Helpful for when I have a lot of unnecessary but interesting stuff open and don't want to clutter my bookmarks, or for when I'm restarting my laptop and/or need a clean slate with the browser."
