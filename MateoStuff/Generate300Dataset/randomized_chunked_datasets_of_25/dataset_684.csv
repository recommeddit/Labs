30354,best Mexican war to study,"Dude, I agree that Trafalger is an emotionally stirring, ""fuck yea"" moment in British imperial history.  I too, have been on the Victory and share the everloving shit out of your sentiment, but please let me present the following points:

That 27-33 is a little misleading.  The British had one less 1st-rate (i.e., the Victory) than the coalition force.  The Spanish/French had NO 2nd-rate ships (90ish guns) compared to the British 4.  The British 3rd rates were mostly 74's and an 80-gun, and the Spanish French had about the same weight.  All in all, the fleets were actually very evenly matched, in terms of broadside weight and square-footage of canvas.  

However, the British were at a decided advantage when it came to having their equipment well-maintained, and also in terms of leadership.  The Royal Navy was fanatical about bringing in ships for repairs, re-coppering their bottoms (made them faster, cut down on rot), and keeping them well provisioned with food, powder, and spare parts.  The Spanish and French weren't so lucky, because their supply chains were more disorganized and infrequent.  

Leadership and training is an embarassment of riches for the Royal Navy.  Nelson was a crazy ass savant when it came to banging hot chicks and winning naval engagements.  He'd been decorated so many times by Trafalgar that he was running out of room to pin the medals.  He had with him a selection of captains that were the best of their day.  Collingwood, Hardy, Berry and others were not as famous as Nelson, but were brilliant in their own right. 

Organization and training were retardedly good in the Royal Navy.  Those guys fucking drilled, drilled, drilled.  Guns were practiced at least once a day, and the Royal Navy was famous for being the only force in the world to routinely practice with live ammunition at this time.  Everyone was cross-trained, so casualties could be backfilled in the heat of battle.  If your buddy got his legs blown off, a topman or sailmaker's mate could step in and help fight that gun, no problem.  British officers went to sea as children, and gradually rose through the ranks from captain's servant to warrant officer to midshipman.  Only midshipmen that proved their worth would actually recieve a real commission as a lieutenant.  Only lucky or extremely capable lieutenants became captains.  This ensured that the person with whom you entrusted a giant fucking floating gun battery KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

On the other hand, the Spanish and French forces were much more poorly led, and understaffed.  The French Revolution culled a lot of good officers from the navy that happened to be aristocrats.  The result was that ships were captained by jumped up bosuns and master's mates.  Good seamen, poor captains.  This effect trickled downward, with less-than capable sailors being called upon to perform extraordinary duties that they weren't prepared for.  Talk about being set up for failure.

The coalition fleet was in poor repair at the time, short provisioned, and ill-trained, and undermaned.  AND they were a coalition.  The British were a unified fighting force, serving one master and one King.  

At this point, you'll realize that the numerical disadvantage has about been compensated for.  Let's go for the clincher:  Tactics.

Normally in that age, ships lined up and shot at each other in pretty little lines.  Nelson said, ""Fuck THAT noise.""  He split his force into two columns, gave one to Collingwood, and proceeded to drive perpendicularly into the French/Spanish line in two place, effectively cutting their force into thirds.  Then, he did what the English, Irish, and Scottish do best:  Go batshit fucking insane and start swinging.

The battle devolved into a crazy-ass melee, where the Royal Navy's overwhelmingly better gunnery began to tell, as they were letting off broadsides at a rate of three for every two French/Spanish.  That's right, the smaller force was throwing half-again as many shots as the big guys.  Fuck yes.

Additionally, the French had a silly tactic where they would shoot for the masts and rigging, hoping to disable the enemy and deprive them of maneuverability.  The Royal Navy's philosophy was a little more simplistic:  Get close and pound the everloving shit out of the enemy until they surrendered or were in a position to be boarded.  

So yea, it all worked out pretty well for the British, except for Nelson dying.  Then, because he was so badass and would have probably gotten toasted during the celebration dinner, had he survived, was preserved in a barrel of alcohol until they could get into port, so as to keep the body fresh for the funeral."

32113,best hotel to live in,"My top 3:

1. Park Hyatt, Sydney: this is my favourite hotel (and in my own city.) The level of service is exceptional. The Australian hospitality industry leaves a lot to be desired in general, but the Park Hyatt gets almost everything right. Plus, almost every room has a view of the Opera House. Every time I check in here, I feel like my blood pressure drops by half.
2. Aman, Tokyo: absolute bliss. The staff are incredible and the hotel itself is a work of art.
3. Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat: Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is one of my favourite places to visit. Like everyone else on the planet, I wish I owned a house there, but staying at the Grand-Hotel is a nice compromise! The hotel itself is huge, but somehow still feels intimate. My favourite thing to do is swim in the *crique de la Causinière* ocean pool attached to the hotel. It's always quiet, unlike other similar places on the French riviera  (like Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, etc)"

Many of us boomers still remember that a guy in a lab coat told us this in multiple Crest commercials of the 1950’s and 1960’s. It sounded impressive. It was also on the back of all their toothpaste tubes.

Our elementary school teacher told us that it means if you brush your teeth and go to the dentist regularly, Crest is okay.

I’m not a dentist or dental hygienist and this doesn’t come anywhere near answering your question, sorry."

And in many cases, they lay the groundwork for the war that follows."

Coloring: 

* Any control over the coloring for file types?
* What about coloring for previews?

Previews:

* Is it possible to allow an external application to handle the preview and then just display it?
* If no for all the above, is it possible to get a hex preview for binary files?"
5828,best programming language for web development,"I can't believe how much bad advice there is in this thread.  Some of it is clearly deliberate trolling; while other replies are apparently sincere, but simply clueless.

OP, start with HTML and CSS.  Unfortunately HTML can no longer be used alone; CSS is necessary to go along with it.  These two will allow you to produce basic Web pages, however.

From there, if you need database connectivity, you can consider PHP.  I consider JavaScript to be an obscenity, and would never encourage anyone to learn it in good conscience; but it does see a lot of use in commercial applications, unfortunately."

37421,best amusement park,"yoooo, i almost forgot about that place. I went when it was called Mountain Creek, but it's the same place. Once you went there, the only way you could leave was with some piece of skin missing. At least, that's the legend.

I remember losing my wallet on that fucking cannonball slide (why did i take a wallet into a waterpark, and thought it was safe in my pocket?) that had like 60 dollars in it - I did not eat on that trip :( Also got a fun back scrape/burn.

The tarzan swing was pretty cool but holy fuck was that water *supernaturally* cold - i think most ppl tended to freeze up when they hit the water, but most ended up making it out fine - though there were always a few who grabbed on to the rope, but were too scared to let go and swung back to the other side, sometimes colliding on the other end. 

There was also that fucking cliff jump thing which to this day im not sure how it passed a safety inspection, or really have much of any kind of thought put into it. You just kinda jumped (or slid off a 3-ft slide) off of a faux cliff into a pool below which IIRC was woefully inadequately deep - not to mention people swimming out would have other jumpers basically land on top of them since it was kinda hard to tell when someone was swimming out below.

Lotta scrapes from that park, But it was still pretty fun. No idea if it's still open or cleaned up today, but it was probably one of the more interesting parks for sure!

Edit: Also just remembered some experience on some kind of water-slide ride - So i don't remember the name of the ride, but I *DO* remember that this was one steep motherfucker. It began as a rather unassuming black plastic tube (so it was pitch-black inside) and then opened up into a half-pipe - you were advised to ride down it a certain way (Arms folded, i think) and once out of the side, it would shoot you into a (again, freakishly cold) pool. The side didn't end like a ""normal one"" into a horizontal thing to slow you down, nope - that would be too safe - It just ended like a dozen feet above a pool and just fucking free-dropped you in. Hope you can swim!  Being a young me, i had closed my eyes during the ride to prepare for the splash, but unknowingly also un-crossed my arms, i *think*holding them at my sides? 

Well apparently according to my on-looking friends, i had been briefly ejected from the slide and caught some serious air going down before slamming back into the chute and then into the water. This was most likely due to the far-too-steep sloping. I apparently very nearly got *permanently* ejected! Whether or not this is true i have no idea - i remember going down, water spraying into my eyes, closing them, then uncrossing my arms, and next thing i knew I had made contact with the frigid pool at the bottom and swam back out, ready and hyped for the next ~~deathtrap~~ ride."
