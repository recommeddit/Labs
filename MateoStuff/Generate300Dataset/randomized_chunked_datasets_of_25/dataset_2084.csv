6398,best Netflix documentary,"Another vote for The Thin Blue Line, or any Errol Morris, really. I really enjoyed Wormwood, his Netflix series on MKUktra. 

And Minding the Gap is one of my favorite movies of the past couple of years."
19474,best YouTube video,I love the bizarre borders videos.
14170,best place to get free books,... please feel free to do some research and get back to us. <3
29756,best money managing app,"It honestly kind of is. It really does force you to face your spending head-on, and by the end your whole attitude towards money will change."
28027,best breakfast foods,Good Eggs Benedict is hard to find... and so worth it. God I love that stuff.

31432,best country to live in,You drink whiskey right after you wake up?
22506,best celebrity,"Once met Colin Hanks at SXSW! My wife noticed him first, but didnâ€™t think it was actually him. We were arguing about it and he came over.  He was super nice, even suggested a band that we should go see. Saw him at said show and he waved at us."
24946,best spiderman actor,"This conversation is never gonna end, but for what it's worth, Andrew is the best actor here."
73418,best battery bank,Hey I'm a little late to the party but I recommend checking out the ones from [Nimble](https://www.gonimble.com/collections/portable-battery-chargers). It's more expensive than Anker but they use recycled or organic products like corn for their casing !
29052,best calendar tool,"I've never used Fantastical, I wasn't a fan of its design. $12 for an app I use all the time I think it's worth it. I subscribe to stuff I like. Like Bear, 1Password, and Timepage. Key features? Nothing insanely notable. I really like the design. I do really like the weather notifications. Honestly. Nothing special now that I think about it. I decided to try it a few months back and I've enjoyed it so far."
72937,best Linux distro,"Can't blame them if course materials and institutes suggest to install (offensive security's) Kali Linux .

There less knowledge about getting basics of linux first, but it's all marketing here. People/friends I know who work at SOC positions can't even trouble shoot basics ( I mean really basic stuff) when it comes to linux."
26122,best politician,"Someone who goes into the technical details of policy. So not ""we're going to bring jobs back"", but ""we're going to strategically invest in X while funding retraining program Y, which our best analysis says should increase employment among the chronically unemployed by Z%"""
41005,best instrument to play,Playing drums (with a full kit) *well* is way harder than playing bass competently (enough for a rock band) IMO.
65431,best phone service company,"I'm guessing it wasn't included originally (looks like it's there) since it's the yearly plan that's promotionally priced (it's really just an ""on sale"" version of the $50/$40 autopay 8GB plan).  The ""25GB"" (8GB+17GB bonus) Walmart plan isn't listed either, but is also the 8GB plan with some modifications.

The $25 one listed without data is a separate plan."
71504,best movies with a cool twist,Primal Fear -
38678,best newspapers to read,"[The Daily Mash](http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/)

On a more serious note, I have stopped reading papers and get my news from reddit instead. One gets the article as well as the polemics and fact-checking in one place."
67205,axios alternatives reddit,"Just use fetch bro, it's the standard, use node-fetch on node cross-fetch if you need RN."
58703,best cologne,"Tom Ford Oud Wood

Tom Ford Fucking Fabulous

Mugler Cologne

Mont Blanc Individuel

PDM Herod
 
Creed Aventus

MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 EDP"
6589,best Netflix documentary,Looks like they took it down. Odd
26571,best board games,"I'll add that telestrations is very enjoyable, but especially if you have a little kid or two in the mix. Somewhere around 4-6 years old. Where they kind of understand what they're looking at or reading, but can't really write or draw. You know, a young drunk person."
32645,best vacation resort,Bucuti is awesome.  Eagle Beach is so much better than the high rise area.
18665,best YouTube video,Yeah you totally suck!
54149,best medicine for a cold,Ha! That's pretty funny
