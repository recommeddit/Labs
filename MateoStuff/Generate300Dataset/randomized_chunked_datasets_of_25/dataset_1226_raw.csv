Bacon and egg! I know its not that healthy dont judge me!
"I think this was part of it for me.  Lots of people praise The Dark Knight because the movie is packed full of stuff every minute, nothing feels offhandish or wasted.

Even the comedic parts of TWS are meant to serve a purpose, Cap trying to find his purpose in the world and live a life of normalcy.  I think by AoU he learns that he's not going to have that."
"I'm currently stuck between the speck presidio 2 and the otterbox symmetry, cant decide"
"Lots of wonderful stories are mentioned above! Here are three more. 

To Say Nothing of the Dog (Connie Willis)

The aristocrats.
Vijay Sethupathi and Fahahd Fassil in all of their movies.
"I like Benchmark Eatery, Savoy Cafe, China Pavilion, Zaytoon, Playa Azul, Carlitos."
"Rather have Akram for Murali and as much as Steve Waugh is my idol, I'd have Lara instead and make Warne captain."
"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is my pick. Taika Waititi is a genius, and this film is no exception. It's emotional as hell, and really fun too."
"Mine had them immediately inside the front door last week. Tons of hand sanitizer, but no cleaning products."
"Idk, I’m a kiwi and I left for a while but it’s not because I couldn’t see a prosperous future here. I left because I wanted to experience the rest of the world! And I’m in a very limited job industry too (garment development)."
"Maybe. 

But if you scale it down to power/dollar,  i doubt any card beats it in value. 

If you can save to buy a budget pc, you can save to get the best value. 

Whats the point of budget, if its obsolete shortly, and you need to make another budget purchase to replace it? 

Saving the 500 for the 3070 is the best choice. And save another 500 for every other component combined. 

50% of a builds budget should be gpu, 50% for everything else. 

1000 is a respectably budget friendly build cost. Not the lowest, no. But far from the highest. 

A 3070 will carry the build many years into the future. Can a ""budget"" card do that?"
"Look, I haven't done any research, but here's my perspective:

Let's say you shake hands with someone who had trace amounts of poop (doodies) on their hand. Now *you* have trace amounts of doodies on *your* hand.

If you use hand sanitizer, it may be sanitized, but you've just rubbed poop (amount doesn't matter; poop is gross) all over both of your hands.

If you wash your hands with soap and warm water, your hands feel great and you no longer have poop on your hands.

That's all I'm saying."
Fleming has to be there in the NZ lineup somewhere. He's the only guy from NZ to have scored more than 7000 runs in the tests.
Soul Knight is a good game to play. You could play alone or with up to 4 people.
"I agree out of what i've played platinum is the best, thanks"
"Ahhh these are always so fun! I'm a gourmand lover and I rarely like anything too citrusy or bright. Fall/Winter scents are my favorite. I can't say this list will look the same in a week, but that's kinda the fun of it, right? 

1. Alkemia Silken Tent - my signature, and some reviewers say it probably smells like Regina George
2. Hexennacht Black Mass - woody dark patch, incense, smoked vanilla, and marshmallows in a smoldering fireplace
3. Chanel Coromandel EDP - Incomparably elegant and beautiful and reminds me of my grandma in the best way - as she was when I was very small. 
4. Mugler Angel Muse EDT - one of my first fragrances! That nutella and passionfruit is perfect
5. Alkemia As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved - the most complex, sexy, dark smoky gourmand for date nights
6. Guerlain Gourmand Coquin - delicious dark chocolate and rum
7. Hexennacht Nightshade - a warm, aromatic green spicy floral
8. Lancome La Nuit Tresor - delicious fruity floriental 
9. Area of Effect Game Over - temple incense and glorious rising smoke
10. Possets Empress Cixi - A stunning dragon's blood and incense scent"
"I pay for WaPo and the Chicago Tribune digital editions, I don’t necessarily read it too often, but often enough to be hit with a paywall when clicking on a Twitter link."
You can't just say that and not show it
Anything by Two Steps From Hell
I’m thinking it usually floats to the top because it’s kind of become such an original text in terms of having mentally and culturally diverse characters.

"Yup, only two alternatives I’ll trust on its face. Some others are fine, but I know I don’t need to to any research on those."
"Oh man, I forgot about this. Need to go buy some immediately"
