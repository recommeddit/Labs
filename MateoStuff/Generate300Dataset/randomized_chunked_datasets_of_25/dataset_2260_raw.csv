"I used to drink redbull religiously, then full throttle (bigger cans) I had approx 2-3 cans a day of this stuff. 

I've since stopped. It is *so incredibly* bad for you. The amount of sugar, caffeine and other ridiculous ingredients do nothing but harm. 

Mind you, I still have some once in a while, and I LOVE redbull+vodka @ parties but I notice that long term usage actually makes me more tired. 

tl;dr: *the crash is not worth the limited energy boost*"
Is this good! I saw on the new releases today and added to my list but wasn’t sure.
"Mesa Verde is fully vegan and it’s by far my favorite restaurant in SB, even though I’m not fully vegan. It was actually awarded the Bib Gourmand award from the Michelin guide (great meals for under $40) but didn’t get any stars."

Fantastic read. I pretty much agree with everything you said. Especially about the Viper.
I am a new convert to Pax Pamir. That game is amazingly good. Like Brass level good for me.
Yes but did they hack the Gibson or did they just have to go Pooooo?
"Mous Limitless 4.0. Hands down the best case I’ve ever had, a little pricey but definitely worth it.

Had the black leather for the 12, going to try out their speckled fabric design for the 13."

"Full disclosure: I don't use Manjaro as my primary Linux distribution any more. I got a new (used) laptop and Manjaro doesn't run that great on it for some reason. I don't feel like taking the time to figure out why. I tried Solus and it's running surprisingly well so I'm going to stick with that for a while.

All that being said, I do still run Manjaro on my desktop PC (when I'm not gaming) and it runs great there! I like how it looks out of the box, there isn't a lot of junk that I need to remove once I first install it, and it's stable enough that I've never really had issues with it. For most people getting into Linux, it's my favorite distro to recommend as well! Much love for Manjaro!"

Oh I love going to that place! Haven't been there since I was a teenager but I remember having a lot of fun :)

Yup. Goes with everything."
"If BBQ, theme parks, and football are your only criteria, go to Columbus, OH.  They have a huge BBQ/ ribs festival, Ohio State's football program is solid and their stadium is one of the biggest in the country, and its not too far of a drive to Ceder Point, best theme park in the world."
"Anything from 60-95% ethanol seems to do the job reasonably well. However, alcohol based hand sanitizers are not suitable for surgical hand disinfection, as they don't kill all *species* of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. For surgical disinfection, you need to scrub in with a disinfectant soap (preferably with chlorhexidine) for 30-60 seconds.

"There isn’t enough baking soda in a tube toothpaste to do much damage to your teeth.  The fluoride will help rebuild lost microns of enamel from brushing. A little bit of abrasiveness will help remove surface stains.  If you like the taste of it then great, use it. Just don’t dip your toothbrush into a box of Arm and Hammer baking soda and brush like a maniac every day."
I absolutely loved MHW and agree with you on the gameplay loop and mechanics of the game. I feel that's what made it such a good game. My only issue  now is that I want to get back into it but there's just so much complexity to the inventory system and learning the core mechanics again just feels too overwhelming and I just can't get back into it.
"Was doubting your reviews due to the disheartning nature of it until i saw the iems guide and having the jabras and sonys and completely agreeing...well crap.  Thank you for this candid list.

 Internet is garbage in this house despite ethernet and nbn.  Microwave disrupts the signal enough to cause lag.  Did you still have connection problems with the g1wl or were they resolved?  Am i just better off saving my dosh and going with the better bang for buck hs70?
Side note is the g1wl sound really that bad? The hyperx revolver s was the best headset ive had so i havent had an audiophile experience before to set a high bar.  If its that underwhelming i might replace them with g935s on the shortlist as they are the same price here.
Edit: was the hs70 the pro or non pro edition?"
