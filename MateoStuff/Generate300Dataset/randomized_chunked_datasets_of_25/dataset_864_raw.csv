Random question but does anybody know who wrote/compiled this list?
"i dont think it has any bad tracks either. but tracks like perfect hair. A.T.H.F and no names are kinda boring to me, i just feel like DOOM's voice is extra laid back on some of the songs on the album while he is talking about very uninteresting things.  maybe im not a big enouch cartoon nerd."

"I'm just trying to point out that he has completely misunderstood the point of the poll, and is trying to list the ""correct"" ranking based on a wrong interpretation of the entire post."
"It all depends on what a person needs and where they are at currently in terms of the age of their website. For example, if someone is just starting out, I would recommend that they use a basic managed WordPress hosting package from the likes of NameCheap. It’s affordable and it’s got all you need to handle a modest amount of traffic. 

Also, if someone doesn’t know squat about development and design, Elementor is a VERY handy WP page builder. There’s a free version for newbies, as well as a premium version. If you’re serious about your website, I definitely recommend going with Elementor premium. Yeah, it will set you back around $60 a year, but what’s $60 per year if you’re ruining a serious, legit business, bro?"

>The Leaf and most other CHAdeMO vehicles are capable of bi-directional charging “out of the box.” It’s just not a capability that Nissan has ever taken advantage of for home customers in the U.S. 

Ok, they almost did it."

This is a great idea. Someone should make an interactive college ranking where you choose how much to weight different factors.
L'Eau par Kenzo! By far!
I have this as well along with 2 others. This is definitely my go to.
"Calculators arent allowed in college calculus and beyond. Graphing calculators are a waste of money and a assle with batteries and the learning curve. Download a free graphing app on your phone, since it won't have much of a learning curve. Get yourself a cheap tablet, instead, in case you decide to pirate textbooks or want an on the go pdf reader

Or an external terabyte harddrive"
