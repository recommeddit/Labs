5697,"Do you know how to program at all?

If you are completely new to programming, I would go in the opposite direction. Learn Python or Ruby, outside of a web framework entirely, and get your basics down. Learn how to wield the power of all of the libraries available for those languages and do cool things. Once you can look at code from a language you haven't worked in before and understand what it's doing, THEN go learn html/CSS/JavaScript/SQL.

Please don't learn PHP or Javascript as your first language. Those languages are really bad, everyone knows it and puts their fingers in their ears. You will be a better programmer if you learn Python first.",best programming language for web development

30512,"so if we use your logic North Korea would be justified by invading South Korea because it doesn’t recognize South Korea as a state or for that matter China could invade Taiwan because Taiwan’s independence is not recognized ..... ....

Texas was established under the Mexican Constitution of 1826; that was relinquished by the Mexican military who then tried to remove Texan colonialist who were Mexican citizens; Texas Had every right to secede from Mexico; and they did and won independence. 

Mexico’s choice to invade the Texas republic to reclaim it was done so with international protests from the USA, UK, France and Spain who all recognized Texas Independence.

Mexico’s internal struggles politically and financially were just as much to blame for Mexican American War as much as manifest destiny took their territories; this went on until 1919.",best Mexican war to study
