"Epub should just download and say “Open in Books” 
I downloaded a pdf from [https://b-ok.xyz](https://b-ok.xyz) and I had to press the middle button on safari to share. The book option popped up and it opened it there. Doesn’t look as clean as a epub one"

Podcasts. I can't listen to music while I train because I end up constantly skipping tracks trying to find one I wanna jam to.

"That's like asking if Ford or Chevy is best. This thinking is basically ""What are the cool kids using?"" It doesn't matter. What can you afford? 


The fun part of art is finding what's best for you. If the best artist you know uses X brand, are you going to use X brand if they don't produce results you like?"

Thanks for the rec for mobilism I didn't know about that site and I found a lot of cookbooks on yudhacookbook which I couldn't find on libgen or b-ok.cc
I’m sorry sir. It’s time for you to leave.
"Ok, so to answer that would be to get into coordinating scents, which is a thing, and a sentless deodorant is actually a very good option.  
A long time ago I used to just wear Speedstick because who cares, as long as it works. Once I started learning about fragrances I realized that Speedstick has a more fresh/watery scent that doesn't coordinate well with me.  
Now I use a Dove Men+Care that has a darker, aromatic smell that matches up better. I honest-to-God can't remember which one right now, I think it has like a grey & blue package.  
In any case, there are hundreds of types of deodorants at the store, right? A whole wall of them. Just use common sense and pick one that pairs well with your fragrance. No need to spend a ton of money on some obscure deodorant."

"You might find 1000 is a lot less money than you think. 

You might find that 1000 is a lot closer to 100 than you think. 

Oh, you can manage 100 for your build? Might as well save till its 1000."

Amen to that!!
Then node-fetch wouldn't be necessary and there wouldn't be a github issue about fetch support being made native in node?
"Caramel apple pops are the shit! Bought a bag yesterday. I'm missing teeth and wear a retainer, and the Caramel gets stuck to it every time. I can't get it off, and I have a lollipop stuck in my mouth for the next ten minutes. 

It's worth every second."
I rather take a couple pills and taste cough medicine.
