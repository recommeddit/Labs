Otherwise, take whatever sweet soft drink you want and dump a bunch of vodka in it, that ought to do the trick.  Some dark/spiced rums are sweet enough that you can mix them strong and hardly notice.  Kracken is like that and so is Diplomatico.

"It's a victim of the series own success, not nearly as good as the original trilogy.

It's fun as hell but the story and script are mostly disappointing."

"Honestly, don't let NME turn you away. The Arctic Monkeys are one of my favorite bands, and they are definitely worth a listen. Listen to their first two albums, you might like it. I don't really get NME's dick-sucking attitude for them, though."
