The real question is should I get 2 solar powered cars or liquid ass spray? Same price.
It really is. Their energy & chemistry on that is nuts
Mint Berry Crunch. Shablagoo!
very useful thank you!
"Seedlings will give you privacy in 10-15 years, if they survive.

Best to go to a local nursery and look at their 6 foot trees.  These will cost you about $50 each but will still be manageable by one person.  They will give you privacy much sooner and have a greater liklihood of survival if you plant them as directed and care for them properly."

"Luxembourg sounds pretty amazing. 3 national languages, 3rd highest GDP per capita, and its one of the least populated countries in Europe. Not to mention half of the population consists of foreigners, so I can't imagine the population is terribly xenophobic unlike here in the States..."
"A donation to a charity that means something to her.  A few years ago we realized we'd all reached the age where we didn't need more stuff, so now our family gives donations for each person (money, time, items, as needed by that charity) then there's a big reveal on Christmas.  It's fun!"
I changed to GIS last semester from electrical engineering. The program is really good!
"Probably things like, ""What are you guys in town for?"" instead of yes-or-no questions like, ""You two in town for the gymnastics competition up the road?""

The latter just provides an easy cover story FOR a bad guy. The first has answers that can beg more questions and thus stress a cover story."
You absolutely must!
Does it wirelessly charge in a Tesla wireless charging bay?  I need this.  :-)
Anything r/EDC related is always a good way to go when giving a gift.
"Then the third book expands even more, thoroughly enjoyable."
"It says best country in the world to live in. In my opinion the USA and Canada are easily the best countries to live in, but that doesn't mean I think they are the best countries on earth. I personally believe that title belongs to the UK."
Yeah! I love GvF! :)
What is delsym though and why do you take that instead of an anti histamine?
"Vodka and orange soda is good, it has some hints of vodka but other than that it has no alcohol taste"
"All revisions absolutely suffer from banding. Unless you followed a random online garbage ""calibration"" guide, which is irrelevant (due to how inconsistent the monitor is) and inherently causes other issues.

Look [here to test banding](http://bestmonitorsbyncx.createaforum.com/general-discussion/best-144hz-monitors/?message=333).

The monitor is extremely average, with rtings.com's copy having a laughably bad [<650:1 contrast ratio](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/dell/s2716dg#comparison_1381), awful [black uniformity](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/dell/s2716dg#comparison_1420), lower [than average gamma](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/dell/s2716dg#comparison_1467) along with usual TN issues (terrible viewing angles, vertical gamma shift, etc.).

Also, with the release of the S2719DGF (and nVidia's support for FreeSync) the S2716DG is completely irrelevant (excluding a lack of strobing/ULMB on the S2719DGF)."
"Texas became independent and than wanted to join the US.  This became mired in issues over slavery.  In the closing days of the Fillmore administration, annexation was approved.

Polk became president in 1845.  He ran on an expansionist platform.  He did settle peacefully the Oregon territory border.  Initially, there was an attempt to buy some territory from Mexico but it failed.  Upon annexation of Texas, the US inherited a disputed border.  Texas said it was the Rio Grande and Mexico, the Nueces River.  Polk put troops in the disputed lands to see if Mexico would attack and they did.  Polk used the event to declare war on Mexico.

The actual war wasn't much of a contest.  The US convincinly won.  The US conquered Mexico City by invading via Veracruz.  Back in the US, the war was controversial.  Some tried to pass a law banning slavery in any annexed territory.  Polk initially wanted even more territory but the need to end the war had him settle for what is the southwest minus the Gadsen Purchase."
Tips for easier peeling eggs.  Don't use fresh eggs- better to boil week old eggs.  Drop egg into cold water and bring to a boil (don't drop directly into hot water).  Add a tablespoon of white vinegar to the water.
"I use MoPub and have had very good luck with them. I'm curious what ad networks people have had good luck with? I use MoPub, Admob, and Flurry mainly. I used to use Facebook and they did well as well. Amazon did well for banners and/or interstitials, can't remember which, but I've since moved to mostly natives and they don't have that."
What is that even?
"Also remember, if you lock your backpack to the luggage rail in a train or bus, and you can’t see it all the time, don’t do it in the shoulder pads. A thief can easily just take the straps out and take the backpack."
I really like Speck cases. Good looking and very protective.
