18101,best Kardashian,"I should have corrected myself, he left back in 2017 or 2018 and I really should ask more! He lives in the West Coast and the last time he was east side was for a family funeral but I'll ask his sister!"
47730,best state to visit in the United States,"**Tennessee**

If you visit Nashville, go see music row, but remember music row is actually two rows, and they're ONE WAYS!! Pretty cool though, just walking down it is nice. 

Also go to cummings falls, it's pretty nice, but I'm sure a lot of places have nice parks too. The main cities to see in this state to know it are: Nashville(of course) Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. The rest is suburban, or country. But each city has it's own personality, so it's important to see each one to really know Tennessee."

38327,best newspapers to read,Thanks for the advice. I really am only looking for paper publications though. I've tried digital and I end up reading maybe 10% or less of what is put out and prefer to read without an electronic device.
47688,best state to visit in the United States,"Mississippi:

Natchez, the Natchez Trace and things along the trace like Windsor Ruins.

Also the delta area is something you can't miss if you like the blues, great food and a cultural experience like nowhere else. Specifically Clarksdale - the Shack Up Inn, New Roxy, Red's and other places around town"

65817,best college in california,Yeah right. Like the UCs are gonna turn away that out of state $
52793,best hiphop album,"I don't think I've heard it tbh. I've heard the title before, but it's not on Spotify.

Daylight/Nightlight is one of my favourite pieces by him."
34337,best NFL player,"Sir! Sirrrrr! 

Why is Thomas Brady so low? He is the God-king of football. 

This is an outrage!

6888,best iPhone,"And that's not even it!! The 6S also got a 5MP front facing camera which was a huge improvement. Another feature the phone got was dual band 10.2.11ac WiFi which allowed it to get double the WiFi speed of the 6 (which had single band ac WiFi) under some conditions. The 6s also has NVMe based storage (1800mbps read speeds!!) unlike the 6.

Also, not only was there 2GB of RAM, but they changed to LPDDR4 starting with the 6S, unlike the 6 and iPad Air 2 which used LPDDR3."
54272,best medicine for a cold,Purely volume wise a titload would be at least 4 buttloads and about 7 dickloads based on an average white dick
72119,best movies with a cool twist,Fight Club
35999,best alcoholic drink,I agree. I'm expecting to have some degree of loss when drinking. But God damn it I fucking like it. Just seeing if there is a way to lessen the blow is all. Maybe the super secret drink that actually helps your work out and gets your drunk off your ass. Even though there is no way that exists.
39383,best web browser,"I use Firefox, but also think Chrome has a lot of great things going on as well. In my personal experience, Chrome is actually faster by a little bit. OTOH Firefox has far better customization, and I like the UI better. Extension support is really a wash between them. For development tools I prefer both for different reasons, I keep both open.

But there is one point Firefox is objectively better. Firefox on Android supports extension, so I got uBlock there. And If I am using FF on phone, I am using the same on Desktop."
12315,best gifts for mom,"Northern Brewer is fantastic, you're lucky that they're local.

The $30 box is almost certainly an ingredient kit, you also need equipment like a fermenter, siphon, bottling equipment and a big boil kettle.

I would recommend [this starter kit](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/beer-equipment-starter-kits/essential-brewing-starter-kit.html) with [this kettle](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/brew-kettles/5-gallon-stainless-kettle.html) for doing 5 gallon batches."
56966,best water brand,"I just buy store brand, refill the bottle with tap water, recycle when it starts to get grody."
19867,best workout music,"Was struggling last night to find new music to workout with. I always use soundclod, so thankyou for this post. ðŸ’™"
70019,best major to study in college,"I logged in just to reply to this. I went to an automotive trade school/business college, and got an A.A.S. in Automotive Technology, and learned how to diagnose, rebuild and repair cars and light trucks. But I ended up getting into welding after college. 

Every older welder or mechanic I know always says, ""don't do this for a living - it's hard, unsatisfying, shitty work that will break your body over time."" 

Not very encouraging, is it?"
54583,best artisan mousepad alternatives,yeah
35160,best NFL player,"Tbf, he was #14 in 2019, when everyone thought he was ""washed up"". And he only had 24 TDs in 2019

With the stats he had in 2020, coupled with the fact that he did that with no OTA and offseason, he should at least be top 10, and most likely top 5."
31969,best hotel to live in,"Best, as in nicest? Probably a toss up between Hilton and Hyatt I guess."
48751,best gaming monitor,Thanks for your input! XD
15953,best sunglasses for fashion,"I went through a brand-name glasses phase for a couple years, specifically a couple each from Ray-Ban and Revo.

After shelling out hundreds and constantly having them break and the lenses scratch at the slightest touch, I picked up a pair of wayfarer knockoffs from Target that have held up far better under way more abuse, and lasted longer than any name brand pair I've ever owned.  

The only noticeable difference to me is the lack of polarization, which means I can actually see my phone now."
