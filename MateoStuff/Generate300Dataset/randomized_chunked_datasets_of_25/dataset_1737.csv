47730,"**Tennessee**

If you visit Nashville, go see music row, but remember music row is actually two rows, and they're ONE WAYS!! Pretty cool though, just walking down it is nice. 

Also go to cummings falls, it's pretty nice, but I'm sure a lot of places have nice parks too. The main cities to see in this state to know it are: Nashville(of course) Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. The rest is suburban, or country. But each city has it's own personality, so it's important to see each one to really know Tennessee.",best state to visit in the United States

Natchez, the Natchez Trace and things along the trace like Windsor Ruins.

Also the delta area is something you can't miss if you like the blues, great food and a cultural experience like nowhere else. Specifically Clarksdale - the Shack Up Inn, New Roxy, Red's and other places around town",best state to visit in the United States

Another feature the phone got was dual band 10.2.11ac WiFi which allowed it to get double the WiFi speed of the 6 (which had single band ac WiFi) under some conditions. The 6s also has NVMe based storage (1800mbps read speeds!!) unlike the 6.

Also, not only was there 2GB of RAM, but they changed to LPDDR4 starting with the 6S, unlike the 6 and iPad Air 2 which used LPDDR3.",best iPhone

39383,"I use Firefox, but also think Chrome has a lot of great things going on as well. In my personal experience, Chrome is actually faster by a little bit. OTOH Firefox has far better customization, and I like the UI better. Extension support is really a wash between them. For development tools I prefer both for different reasons, I keep both open.

But there is one point Firefox is objectively better. Firefox on Android supports extension, so I got uBlock there. And If I am using FF on phone, I am using the same on Desktop.",best web browser

The $30 box is almost certainly an ingredient kit, you also need equipment like a fermenter, siphon, bottling equipment and a big boil kettle.

I would recommend [this starter kit](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/beer-equipment-starter-kits/essential-brewing-starter-kit.html) with [this kettle](http://www.northernbrewer.com/shop/brewing/brewing-equipment/brew-kettles/5-gallon-stainless-kettle.html) for doing 5 gallon batches.",best gifts for mom

After shelling out hundreds and constantly having them break and the lenses scratch at the slightest touch, I picked up a pair of wayfarer knockoffs from Target that have held up far better under way more abuse, and lasted longer than any name brand pair I've ever owned.
