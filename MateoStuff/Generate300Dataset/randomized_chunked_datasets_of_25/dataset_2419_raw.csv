Worst: candy corn. What the fuck is that shit."
"Bacon sandwich made with 3-4 rashers of fat-trimmed English bacon (not streaky bacon), warm freshly-baked bread, a light spread of proper butter on one side and a slightly more generous spread of ketchup on the other. Serve that with a large mug of steaming freshly ground coffee and you have yourself a winning breakfast"
"Sorry, but this article is garbage and the comments defending it are garbage. So someone wants to study film...great! Less competition for engineers! We forget how many people are involved in making one product. In the example of, say, a camera, sure, you need someone to engineer it, but you also need factory workers to assemble it and make the parts, ad agencies to market it, film...people to shoot ads, graphic designers to design ads, and retail workers to sell it, with managers back at the company deciding what to do with profits and the costs of manufacturing. Everyone plays an equally important part. 

Basically, if the world is full of engineers and doctors, nothing is going to happen."
"I share a name with a fairly famous athlete, so you have to add some fairly specific terms to the search before anything about me pops up. It's pretty nice."

Cedar Point or Magic Mountain. Both just a couple hours by car or plane.
Pineapple juice will break up the phlegm and make it easier to cough up. Use this for me and all my kids. If it is too strong dilute it with water. I always keep a couple of the small cans in my fridge.
As more of a preventive measure or once you actually get sick? I find both to be quite effective.
"Okay, here's a step by step: 

- make sure your lights are on. You could put a pumpkin outside if you want to make sure they know to come up. 

- the kids will knock or ring the doorbell (if you want to leave the door open or sit on the porch, you can, but you don't have to)

- They'll say ""Trick or Treat!!!!"" It'll probably be really loud. 

- Say some variation of ""wow, look at these great costumes!"" You can ask who they're dressed as, or (if you can tell clearly) you can guess who they are or (if it's totally obvious) you could call them by the name of the character (i.e. Hi there, Superman! Are you taking time off from protecting the world to get some candy?"" That's all just fancy stuff you can say to go the extra mile. At the least, compliment their costumes.

- Kids wearing scary costumes like to be told how scary they look!

- As a kid, I liked being able to dig my hand in the bowl and pick my own. You can say ""Only take one, please!"" or ""Only take two"" if you're being generous. If that makes you uncomfortable, you can pick pieces for each kid. One or two (depending on size) is totally normal. 

- Once they have the candy, they'll move to the next house. Parents urge them to say thank you, so they most likely will. 

- Say ""You're welcome! Happy Halloween!"" and you're done!"

"A Dazor model 1000 like this:

They go for around 40-75 on ebay and many are well over 50 years old.  Very heavy and high quality and made in USA.  There are several other types of Dazors that are clip on that also look very nice."

"In our workspaces we used Sherwin Williams ""spare white"" which is very neutral, no cool or warm at all, without being so bright as to be harsh."
