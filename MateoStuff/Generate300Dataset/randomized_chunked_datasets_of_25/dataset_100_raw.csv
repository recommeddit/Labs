"I have a friend who worked at a golf course he played at from time to time.  After the round he would apparently head into the clubhouse restaurant/bar with a huge posse, order upwards of $1,000 in food and drinks, be waited on hand and foot because he's Michael fucking Jordan, and then not tip whatsoever.  Literally *zero* tip."

"Oh this is easy lol. You like really sweet and girly perfumes! I can tell you like your gourmands and sugary scents. I think you’re in your early 20’s, maybe 22-25. You’re very feminine and extremely girly, very outgoing, loud, fun to be around, and personable with those around you. You love to stand out in a crowd but just like your taste in perfumes, you’re also sweet and adorable to boot! Probably work in fashion or something creative, like a designer or artist"
