2623,"It's difficult to determine a ""sweet spot"" for audio gear, since everyone's disposable income are different and vary widely, individually. 

I'm a bargain hunter for quality goods. I picked up most of my headphones and IEMs at big discounted prices, but I don't merely buy any and all gear that goes on sale... it has to be to my preferences and liking. For example, no matter how many times ""deals"" pop up for the over-hyped M50X, I'm not going to buy it.

Some of my favorites include the legendary sale of Ultimate Ears TF10 for $95 four years ago, Monster Miles Davis Tribute for $130, Audio-Technica A900X for $106, Audio-Technica ESW9A for $109, Sennheiser HD700 for $325, etc. Gifted Klipsch X10 for $85 and Sennheiser HD598 for $99. 

I guess my personal ""sweet spot"" for good headphones and IEMs is $80-$150. However, if I find a killer deal for an item I really want, like HD700 for $325, I'm going to go above my ""sweet spot"" and try my best to acquire it. 

Most friends and relatives of mine think I'm crazy for spending so much on audio gear, but they don't realize how much more other audiophiles are willing to spend. Some people don't blink an eye dropping hundreds and thousands on hi-fi and summit-fi gear. I'm personally not crazy or wealthy enough to do that (yet). 

I think the vast majority of the general public wouldn't spend more than $100 on headphones and IEMs. Unless of course, it's for superficial reasons like getting Beats as a necklace to look cool in public. But I think even hipsters realize these days that Beats are ripoffs and word has spread that spending so much for crappy - mediocre sound quality is just stupid.

P.S. Keep up the good work on your videos, Lachlan. I hope you buy the HD700 someday and do a proper review (with a good tube amp) for it. :)",best headphones

34768,"In any particular order I think these three have the best claim to the title: Jerry Rice, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning.

Obviously Tom is my favorite, but I feel in a lot of categories you can make a serious case for Peyton over him (and of course, vice versa). I don't feel like it's clear cut at all. And I don't think Jerry Rice needs any explaining.

My top 3 disregards pre Super Bowl era players because I'm honestly uninformed enough in that regard besides just hearing the various legend's name. Defensive players get disregarded too if only because the three players I named had/have such longevity that their AV starts to get too large to ignore, especially considering the fact that all three of these players consistently put up MVP caliber seasons throughout their careers.

I think a case could be made for Montana too, considering his flawless Super Bowl record and very high skill of QB play adjusted for era. I just feel that Peyton and Tom played on an equal level and did it even longer.",best NFL player
