44787,"Noise cancelling headphones (Anker Soundcore Q20 from Amazon for about $70). I am so easily distracted by noise, it blocks out my neighbours using the leafblower for an hour, the central heating noise, mutes conversation so it's less distracting. Has made working from home infinitely better and would be great if I was sharing an office one day too. 

6ft unbreakable phone charger, so I can use my phone while it charges and I don't have to replace the cable every 3 months.

Chromecast ~$30. So easy to stream anything to my tv and I can still use my phone at the same time unlike Apple tv mirroring. I can even load a YouTube video for my cat and then leave the house.

A good pillow, and although it was a little over $100, a memory foam mattress topper. My body stopped hurting.

A fire alarm (free). In most developed countries, you can book your local fire department to come and install a new fire alarm for free. Previous tenants took it off for parties and my landlady isn't very responsive and I didn't want to pay for a new one myself but also I didn't want to burn to death in my sleep.",best items under $100
72842,"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is good, but most all colleges use MS Windows to teach C++ and Java programming. The senior could be pulling your leg!  If you have plenty of room on your hard drive, read up on Ubuntu and then install it. Beware that when using Firefox in Windows it's 32 bit and may offer you the 32 bit iso even if you have a 64 bit processor. IF you have a 64 bit processor, get the 64 bit iso. 4 gb of ram is ok, 8 or 16 gigs of ram is better if you are going to compile programs - but that also depends on your hardware. Use the Ubuntu iso to create a bootable usb flash drive (stick) boot it up, do not install just to test and check it out first. Search and read about UEFI or EFI (if you have it, ck your BIOS) on the ubuntu site.  Good luck!",best Linux distro

36962,"I've been to Six. Going to SFGAdv this Summer. 

1. SFOG - With the ride collection and quality of SFGAm, the theming, landscape, and beauty of SFOT, and having my favorite roller coaster Goliath, this one tops it all. 

2. SFOT - The theming, interconnected-ness with the environment and landscape, and just an overall beautiful park with plenty of rides.

3. SFFT - Beautiful park with fun themed areas and a unique setting, and Iron Rattler is amazing. 

4. SFGAm - So many rides, but it's the second most Six-Flags-y out of these. (First is SFMM) 

5. SFStL - Quaint, cute, hilly, and comfy. A great collection of woodies, friendly staff, and just a cozy park with fun rides. Just not as much to do as the other parks, hence its low placement. 

6. SFMM - Terrible experience at this park. If you wanna know the story, ask.",best roller coaster at six flags
