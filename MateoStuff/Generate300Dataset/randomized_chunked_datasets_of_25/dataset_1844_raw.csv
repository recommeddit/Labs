You're The Best Around by Joe Esposito.
"Let's see...Mylo's *Destroy Rock & Roll*, Boyz Noize, Busy P, MSTRKRFT, The Bloody Beetroots, Digitalism, Soulwax, the list goes on...

And those are some of the best tracks on Homework. I bet you thought Da Funk was the best song on there and hated Rollin' & Scratchin, right? And didn't understand the references on Teachers?"
"Out of bias and nostalgia, I'd liked to say that San Miguel is great. It's steps from a decent dining common, close to most classes and you have the San Miguel Ghost. I really loved being on the Creative and Performing Arts floor, as we were one of the tightest knit groups that I know of. Both of our floors bonded well and often.

But I heard that Santa Cruz is actually really great since it has pretty big rooms, near the beach and a dining common, but triples everywhere. I never heard of any tripling in San Miguel. Anacapa is also good, but a little further away from classes, but only relatively.

Fuck FT!"
The deals we get up here are few and far between unfortunately :( Lots of equipment cost almost double here than the US. I got my HD650s for around $500 CAD where down south can be had for under $300.. Guess it comes down to supply and demand.
"Check out the Kancamangus Highway in NH, lots of hiking trails. It connects the towns of Lincoln and Conway which are both pretty nice as well."
Which country are you in?
"In no particular order:

1. Aaron Rodgers
2. Patrick Mahomes
3. Tom Brady
4. TJ Watt
5. Davante Adams
6. Travis Kelce
7. Aaron Donald
8. Derrick Henry
9. Alvin Kamara/Myles Garrett (Leaning Garrett in the top 10, Kamara just being out of it)
10. DeAndre Hopkins"

"Trumpet, anything by Chris Botti is awesome."
"Didn't see these recommended yet, so:

Booq:  Their stuff is incredibly high quality.  I have a giant laptop (thick Alienware M17x) and it wouldn't fit in the Booq without forcing it so I returned the bag.  Can confirm that the materials and construction are top notch and they have some unique designs. 

Everki:  This is what I ended up with (the Beacon).  It's a lot softer than the Booq, but it's built like a tank.  I've taken that thing on countless flights, hikes, walks in the rain, etc. and not a single split seam, broken zipper/pull, torn material.  

I preferred the look and function of the Booq, but they're both built incredibly well."
"I see this comment so much. People think NVDA is just a gpu company, so they compare it to the other gpu company. NVDA is SO much more. Go read their annual report then get back to me if you believe differently."
"Have you never heard of Cruyff's Dream Team of the early 90s? Trust me, they were plenty dominant before 2000."
"This is [comic's Peter Parker](https://www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AmazingSpider-Man20151-p1-350x350.jpg) since some years ago, its been many, many years since he was the nerdy high school kid. In looks Holland and McGuire are ok, Garfield failed at the personality that Peter usually has though."
"I thought of it, but it's a pre-US war. What happened between the US and Native Americans is a very ugly series of conflicts--particularly since there was a lot of cultural ignorance involved."
"Tie between the X and 11 Pro. The only reason I even got the 11 Pro was because I switched from Sprint to Verizon, and they offered me something like $700 in trade in credit to upgrade, so it would have been foolish not to, lol. Otherwise, I could see the X lasting me another 3 or 4 years."
What's the repo for zebra?
"Try the Malorean and Belgeriad sagas by David Eddings.  Also the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson,  and the Twelve Houses series by Sharon Shinn."
"One time, when I was super broke and couldn't afford to travel to where my parents were living, I made it happen. A friend was passing through my town and I hitched a ride, then used a complicated series of rides and couches from other friends to stay away from my parents'house until my mom was at work and I'd had a chance to get a few hours of sleep. I knew when she went to lunch every day so about five minutes before hand, a friend and I walked into my mom's office to take her out to lunch. She bawled. We all cried. It was one of the best moments I've had with my mom. I miss her."

Most definitely.  Gen 5 has an ice cream cone pokemon, Gen 6 has a key ring, but Gen 1 had pokeballs, pile of sludge, and magnets.  It's always been silly stuff with eyes on them, but nostalgia is a hell of a drug.  I'm afflicted with it, too."
"Yeah, those are lame."
The King Solomon story is fucking hilarious
"Whiskey. I used to be an Irish whiskey guy, but lately Bourbon's been really growing on me."
"What do you use yours for?

I got a cheap version of that that I hung under my lofted dorm bed in college and slept in every night for a year. I kind of miss that."
