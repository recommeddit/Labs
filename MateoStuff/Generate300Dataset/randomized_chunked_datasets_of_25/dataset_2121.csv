32772,best vacation resort,"Which Secrets? There are a few I think in that area, but I have stayed at the Secrets Silversands and while I haven't been in a few years, my family and I used to go for Christmas. Granted it was a different experience and pricier, but we always really enjoyed ourselves. It's adults only which is nice, and there were always fun groups of vacationers from all over to meet and chat with during our trip. From the Cancun airport it's about 20-25 mins away, so not sure this is the location or particular Secrets. you are talking about. There is a Maroma, and a couple more but some are much more south."

16561,best pet for toddlers,"When I was little, I caught a snail for the first time and was allowed to keep it as a pet. Just a regular garden snail. They're fun to hold and let crawl around your hand and arms. And they fit in larger toy cars and doll houses! As long as you can get your child to be gentle with it, it would be a cute first pet."

8549,best toothpaste,"Spawn of a dentist. Can't comment on the toothpaste matter specifically, but I thought this was interesting: asked my dad if you could only brush your teeth OR floss, which was more important? He said flossing is more important than brushing. So all you lazy people who take time to brush, but not floss, think about this. Don't forget to floss!"

13482,best research paper archive,+1 for arXiv
43740,best items under $100,In my opinion it's not really any better than normal flossing itself but it's so much easier to do thus leading to me flossing more. Ive had a very bad habit of either forgetting to floss or saying screw it I don't want to spend the time doing that but the water flosser is something I can do in about 20 seconds and still feel like I've done a satisfactory job.

7786,best laptop for general use,"Sorry once again, but one last thing: I have found the Flex 5 for $1000, but I have also found the Yoga C740 for around $1080. Almost everything is the same or significantly better (16gb ram, 300 nit screen on the C740 vs 250 nit on the Flex 5, better color accuracy on the C740, 1Tb hardrive on the C740 vs 256 on the Flex 5), however, the only thing is that the C740 has the ""10th Generation Intel Core™ i7-10510U Processor (1.80 GHz, up to 4.90 GHz with Turbo Boost, 4 Cores, 8 Threads, 8 MB Cache)"" which I noticed was a different brand than the Ryzen 5 on the Flex 5. Do you happen to know whether the computers come close enough in terms of performance?"
