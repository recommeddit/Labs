32772,"Which Secrets? There are a few I think in that area, but I have stayed at the Secrets Silversands and while I haven't been in a few years, my family and I used to go for Christmas. Granted it was a different experience and pricier, but we always really enjoyed ourselves. It's adults only which is nice, and there were always fun groups of vacationers from all over to meet and chat with during our trip. From the Cancun airport it's about 20-25 mins away, so not sure this is the location or particular Secrets. you are talking about. There is a Maroma, and a couple more but some are much more south.",best vacation resort

8549,"Spawn of a dentist. Can't comment on the toothpaste matter specifically, but I thought this was interesting: asked my dad if you could only brush your teeth OR floss, which was more important? He said flossing is more important than brushing. So all you lazy people who take time to brush, but not floss, think about this. Don't forget to floss!",best toothpaste

Ive had a very bad habit of either forgetting to floss or saying screw it I don't want to spend the time doing that but the water flosser is something I can do in about 20 seconds and still feel like I've done a satisfactory job.,best items under $100

7786,"Sorry once again, but one last thing: I have found the Flex 5 for $1000, but I have also found the Yoga C740 for around $1080. Almost everything is the same or significantly better (16gb ram, 300 nit screen on the C740 vs 250 nit on the Flex 5, better color accuracy on the C740, 1Tb hardrive on the C740 vs 256 on the Flex 5), however, the only thing is that the C740 has the ""10th Generation Intel Core™ i7-10510U Processor (1.80 GHz, up to 4.90 GHz with Turbo Boost, 4 Cores, 8 Threads, 8 MB Cache)"" which I noticed was a different brand than the Ryzen 5 on the Flex 5.
