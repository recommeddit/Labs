I'm a woman so gender issues are important to me. This is the first I've heard about him being misogynistic. Can you point me to an article?
"We used this on our walls, looks amazing! 

Used basic white paint, cheap, for the ceiling. It has a slight gray tone to it which really compliments the wall paint."
"So creepy, Love it!!!"
"Unless range gets higher or fast charging stations proliferate, can’t consider one."
"Chrome azarro! SOOOO many women say various things to the tune of ""wow you smell good""."
"I also forgot Mariana Zapata - all of her books are great.  One of my favorites is called Bright Side by Kim Holden.  I smiled, giggled, and cried so hard.  It is followed by up Gus."
"True, but I think it is the fact they are all the same that I like."
"I use mint a for high level tracking and then I went a step further.  I have a Google sheet that breaks down in 2 week increments ( based on the couple times a month major expenses hit, like student loans and mortgage, and when paychecks come in). 

I then have different cells set up as sums of expenses/deposits (I add lines entries as needed, like if I took out cash that week, or had a non regular expense paid in cash).  Credit card payments just take a single cell since I pay them in full.  


Gives a more granular view and lets me know how much I'll have after major expenses come out, and if I need to shift money around in advance"
"SoCal style eggs benedict. Instead of Canadian bacon use a crab cake (lightly fried is the key) and add avocado, I've seen it with tomato added as well but I can do without. Pile on the hollandaise with your poached egg and your good to go. Seriously so damn good."
"Poland spring *water* is okay. Their bottles are the worst I've ever experienced though (very thin plastic that gets crushed easily and generally makes a lot of extraneous noise, which I find quite annoying)..."
Probably because that's death.
"Finally, someone I agree with!"
"SNICKERS = NO
100 Grand = NO
Reese Pieces = YES
Almond Joy = YES

=50% so its a toss up

Change to Reeses Cups and you win! And I do enjoy a almond joy as well so you might have a point but I am sticking to my 50%!"
">Eco Egg $50 - It's 720 loads worth of laundry detergent. Cleans all except for stuff that should have had a presoak with oxiclean in the first place. On my second one, can confirm it lasts at least that long

Aren't these pseudoscience BS? Amway used to sell stuff like that in the 90s, I'm assuming it's similar? [https://gizmodo.com/this-kickstarter-is-clearly-just-a-marketing-scam-from-1689640209](https://gizmodo.com/this-kickstarter-is-clearly-just-a-marketing-scam-from-1689640209)"
"[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the
mallard Anas platyrhynchos](http://www.nmr.nl/nmr/binary/retrieveFile?instanceid=16&itemid=2574) (pdf warning) is concise and quite the interesting topic."
"A Sci-Fi must read list with no Ballard.

...my god."
Morray
"Thanks for the response I legitimately thought no one would ever see this.

Thanks I have two math electives left for my math degree so I'll use those two courses to cover it"
"I have no interest whatsoever in either cycling or doping but the number of times I saw Icarus recommended here eventually wore me down.

It was engaging from the beginning, but the way the whole thing played out was good enough that I actually, out loud, asked my TV if this was really happening.

And I give bonus points to anything that convinces me to talk to my TV."
"Yeah lots of people wouldn’t call it sci fi, but I would. It takes place in a near-future dystopia, which gets it in the club. 

I enjoyed guessing what the event was that caused all that destruction."
"You torrent on the box itself, and just download the files via ftp, ssh, http to your home box. Ultraseedbox is a decent provider for around $13 USD."
Yessss Ultramarine is amazing
"Olio Pizzeria  is fantastic Neapolitan style pizza.

RtJ is great any time you want to be hyped
Love my Pok3r with clears. 55-95g of force not terribly clicky. I used to game on greens but the click eventually became too much for me lol.
