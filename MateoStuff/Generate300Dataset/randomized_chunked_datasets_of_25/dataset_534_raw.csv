I like it too.  I sometimes recommend when people ask for sci-fi recommendations.
I have a pair of Enchroma colorblind glasses. They cost 300$ lol but I wear them every day.
"Tom Hanks, absolutely nice. I met him when I worked at in n out burger a few years back. I took an order to his table & was startled when I saw him & I asked “Are you Tom Hanks.” & he looks up from his meal, gives the biggest friendliest smile & says “you betcha.”

When I’m clocking out & leaving he’s heading out exactly as I am so I hold the door open for him, & he greets me with a Thank you. & as he & his son are walking away I say “Mr. Hanks if it’s not any trouble could I possibly take a picture with you?” He turns around with another big grin & says “walk with me kid.” So we talked for about 10 minutes, he asked me about my life, told him all of my favorite movies he is in. He gave me some life advice & his son (very nice but just quiet) took some pictures of us. He gave me a handshake followed by a hug saying it was nice to meet me. I said “I’m glad the most famous person I got to meet was you.” Then they left.

Needless to say my co-workers stared through the windows the entire time & then hounded me for a week about it."
I had no idea. This is great to know. Universally true for all journals?

"If you're going to seriously use that ""road"" argument, then you should eliminate the Australian and South African bowlers because they bowled on bowler friendly wickets. That argument can go both ways."
"We have been using an Anker for the past 3-4 years and it is going strong. We have a bigger one, I think it is like 10,000 mAh, and so it isn't small. We get about 3+ charges for a phone out of it (used to be 4-5 when it was new)."
They have been better lately.  At least for me.  I suspect they they used to suck for me bc I was using an old version pf Mopub
"My friend’s partner’s best friend is the Hemsworth brothers’ mum’s godson and they have hung out with the fam a couple of times. 

Through that very reliable link and via the one conversation we’ve had about it, I can report I have heard nothing but good things about the Hemsworths!"

"All games due for release on the Series X are playable online on PC, cross platform, except for Destiny 2, to my knowledge."
Manifest Destiny is how it’s taught in schools. Usually at both the middle school and high school levels depending on the state.
Is there any sub 1k (usd) 3060 with a ryzen processor?
Malibu and pineapple juice is just as tasty!
Yeah I've seen that about the right angle thing and will definitely buy from glorious
"Great article and shitty of Nike no doubt. That said, I find it pretty funny that this article makes a comparison, even slightly, to Nike possibly losing out on this upcoming running star to them losing Steph Curry. Apples and oranges x1000000."
"Matte for practicality. Glass for looks. Tried the matte. Was nice, didn't like how it made videos look. Switched to gloss. Love how it looks, I prefer how the matte felt. I want to switch back to matte now. There's no right answer, ugh."

"I think it was 2009 build a bear came out with a moose. My mother likes mooses for some reason.  I unfortunately can't remember why that Christmas my brother and I called our mother Margaret. She couldn't stop laughing at that for some reason. So I have enough money I go to build a bear. Get her the moose, you know I dress the thing in a miss Santa's dress. Now up comes the heart noise button thing. I like humor in my gifts, I'm not going for merry Christmas, no I'm going straight to the dinosaur roar. Yes the store employee asked if I wanted to do the whole give the bear a heart gift,  I fucking did it.  Now comes the name the damn thing, as the post said my mom laughed at my brother and I calling her Margaret I felt that would be the most suitable name. Thus born Roaring Margaret the Moose a Christmas gift.  My mom still has it out and ready to push to make the damn thing roar, and also has put it out as a decoration. I'm 34 now I gave that to her around the time I was 26-27 if I remember right I can't top that gift. 

P.S. on mobile sorry for format"
"*People come back home, only to find that their house sitter has hung themselves in their kitchen*

""The kitchen drove me to it! Why did you have to pick grey?! Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Now my cat and dog are homeless!"""
Yeesh.  That's unfortunate.  The price is definitely going to further increase due to the fact that no one is making it anymore.  We've essentially been running on Pickard's leftovers for the past 15 years.
Browns are a good compromise between Reds and Blues.
Seconding Line of Duty! I’ve watched the first four seasons in about a week and a half. Absolutely fantastic!
