"I was thinking ManU, bcuz they're owned by Americans. But I guess they're like the Yankees of soccer. I hate the Yankees. Chelsea jus won Premier League and I don't wanna be a front runner."
"Its crazy to me that Inis is 96, you would think that its a critics darling given its innovativeness and brilliant art."
"AutoMod fucked me on the links I guess. I don't know. It would be great if anyone could assist me please. I don't know what the fuck that automod wants, I used the url links provided by the list."
"Germany actively tried to entice Mexico into war with the US.

>You know, if you're German and a supposed ""Neutral"" nation is supplying your enemy arms and supplies what would you do?

Germany was just as free to buy arms from the US as the UK was. That they couldn't get them through the effective British blockade was not the United States' problem."
"Thanks for informing me. I've added the DLC link to the description. I did noticed a few expansion workshop items, that might be the expansion you're referring to?"
"Yeah, it's my favourite genre. Why?"

Is this a good thing? What are your thoughts on the series?
"Thanks.  You you know how long the battery lasts when gaming hand helt?  Having only a laptop as a reference, that lasted hardly an hour :P"
"I'd say the 1st most important component in a pc is what's between the chair and the monitor.

2nd most important would be monitor, keyboard and mouse."
"Depends upon the job, as well as whether that's even relevant to the OP's question. It might be for retirement, or just visiting."

"I stick to my Natives for everyday use. A cheap pair of Nectars goes a long way too, for doing things or going places I think I might lose my nicer sunglasses."
I meant it's not just the English team from the 20s-40s that rolled in their graves. Other teams also lost to The Invincibles.

"From my undertstanding:

1.  Toby was not an accurate portrayal of Spider-Man, but was a good actor in strong movies, at least 1 and 2.

2.  Andrew was a pretty accurate portrayal of Spider-Man, but not in particularly strong movies.

3.  The new guy is spot on in a well executed series."
Hmmmmmm...
I play it on a iPhone 11 But my wife is playing it on a iPhone 8 so it runs exactly the same. No problems
The S2721DGF uses the same Nano IPS panel as the LG 27GL850. I believe the previous model the S2719DGF was a TN but this time around it's a Nano IPS and its fantastic!

"I just got an iPhone XR yesterday with the A12 it’ll still probably be supported till 2024 or later.. and it’s still fast as hell, and the battery lasts me 2 days on a single charge. Had it yesterday for the first day at 100% and used it for 4 hours straight without shutting off the display and it only went down to 73%... it’ll definitely beat the XS or XS max in the battery department for sure, and the screen is better than people think, it’s the pixel density that matters and this has a higher pixel density than the iPad Pro and everyone loves that display... This thing is a beast still and it’s the perfect size, not too large like the max or plus phones but bigger than the smaller iPhones for sure. I love it so far! Plus if you go the used market you can get it cheaper than that price sometimes. I’d definitely recommend this phone. It’ll last you at least 4 years if you need it to without any issues."
"Go run a couple of fast miles. If it's a cold, you'll be over it quick. But if it's the flu, you'll feel *really* sick afterward."
