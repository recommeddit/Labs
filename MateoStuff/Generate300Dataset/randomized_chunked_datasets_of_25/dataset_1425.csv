23273,"Rubber band effect is an important distinction. In many ""arcade racers"" the rubber banding is serious. Meaning if you end up trailing, the competing cars' AI slows down on purpose. Where if you take a heavy lead the AI actively becomes more competitive. (Think Mario Kart)

I'm not heavy into pure sim racers, but I'd assume there would be less, or no rubber banding at all. In real life a lead is a lead after all.

P.S. in edition to Asseto Corsa and the Forza games, Need for Speed Shift is one of the best non-underground Need for Speed games, which is much closer to Forza style arcade/sim balance.",best car racing video game

57587,Can confirm. Was in Sephora the other day looking for gifts; ended up smelling like over 10 colognes but Margiela’s was one of my favourites. They also describe the scent on the label of each one in classic MM fashion so that’s also pretty cool (I was looking at the 3-pack one).,best cologne

As for rides you might not think would be that great but you should DEFINITELY ride, I'd say give Apocalypse, Superman: Escape From Krypton, and Viper a shot. Those rides never fail to impress me.",best roller coaster at six flags
55195,"The key to the Adirondacks is to look down, not up. From the brooks to the bogs, the ferns to the mushrooms is what's at you feet that makes it so cool. 

So easy to look up in the Rockies and Tetons (and they are super cool) but is a more subtle beauty in the Adirondacks.
