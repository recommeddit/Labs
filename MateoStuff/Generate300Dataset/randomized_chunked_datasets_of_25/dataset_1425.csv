""Chop wood, carry water"""
23273,best car racing video game,"Rubber band effect is an important distinction. In many ""arcade racers"" the rubber banding is serious. Meaning if you end up trailing, the competing cars' AI slows down on purpose. Where if you take a heavy lead the AI actively becomes more competitive. (Think Mario Kart)

I'm not heavy into pure sim racers, but I'd assume there would be less, or no rubber banding at all. In real life a lead is a lead after all.

P.S. in edition to Asseto Corsa and the Forza games, Need for Speed Shift is one of the best non-underground Need for Speed games, which is much closer to Forza style arcade/sim balance."
41392,best instrument to play,I personally love the piano. I think anyone could play the guitar if he tried so I don't put much stock in that. If you just want to get laid though then go for the guitar.
56821,best desktop monitor,"Somebody's been overpaying for monitors, i see"
57587,best cologne,Can confirm. Was in Sephora the other day looking for gifts; ended up smelling like over 10 colognes but Margiela’s was one of my favourites. They also describe the scent on the label of each one in classic MM fashion so that’s also pretty cool (I was looking at the 3-pack one).
34103,best NFL player,your joke makes no fucking sense up there.

71775,best movies with a cool twist,"Came here to say *Sorry to Bother You*. It just goes into this wild, unexpected direction."
30126,best Mexican war to study,"Not for me, I don’t know where you live but we mostly focused on the timeline of events, the causes, and then the effects. All pretty equally, not just the effects. Also the only effects we really learned was the things in the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo."

67378,axios alternatives reddit,"Oh no, how will I ever learn to use *fetch*?"
36979,best roller coaster at six flags,"I'm gonna say Tatsu is the best. It's so graceful, long, and an incredible experience. Besides that, don't miss out on X2, Twisted Colossus, and Full Throttle.

As for rides you might not think would be that great but you should DEFINITELY ride, I'd say give Apocalypse, Superman: Escape From Krypton, and Viper a shot. Those rides never fail to impress me."
55195,best places to hike in the east coast,"The key to the Adirondacks is to look down, not up. From the brooks to the bogs, the ferns to the mushrooms is what's at you feet that makes it so cool. 

So easy to look up in the Rockies and Tetons (and they are super cool) but is a more subtle beauty in the Adirondacks. 

Great pic."

6884,best iPhone,"Just got SE 2020 to upgrade from my 6s, since then i reset my 6s into factory settings and oh boiiii it was buttery smooth than the iOS 14 beta on my SE!

I’m planning to replace my 6s battery and home button so i could actually use it as a second phone."
54256,best medicine for a cold,What's an arcasm? Do I want this?
22635,best celebrity,"Met JLo and Jane Fonda while I worked at a private FBO (an operation at a major airport for rich people to fly out of) and I said hello to JLo. Nope, not even a response. Jane Fonda on the other hand, said hi back, and asked me how my day was. This was when they were filming Monster in Law. She was a nice lady."
33084,best energy drink,"no thanks. 

corn syrup and chemicals."
67625,axios alternatives reddit,"The worst part is, there is no number of downloads on npm that obligate you to maintain software. If people want it, they can pay for it. Otherwise, honestly, they can shove off."
31294,best country to live in,If I had to choose? Canada. Fuck the USA.
