15106,best tree for the garden,I live in a very similar climate. Actually it gets colder and hotter here. One of my absolute favorites from where I live is the American Sycamore. I'm not sure what's native around you but these are beautiful long lived trees. You can't go wrong with an Oak or even something a bit odd like a Katsura could be really cool!
46284,best trick or treating candy,"My mom always made me throw out the weird homemade stuff (she was worried it could have been spiked or something…). Based upon OP's description of what candy he bought, I think he's fine."

63058,Best online React course,"Wow. thanks so much. Going to dive into this real soon. THANK YOU, totof04"
5753,best programming language for web development,"HTML5 and CSS3 are just the newest standards of HTML and CSS. They include new (super cool) features, but the same basics are all still there."
53669,best medicine for a cold,"I want to emphasize, **don't** combine an **Expectorant** and a **Cough suppressant**.  
It's not harmful, but they are kind of working against each other. The expectorant loosens up the phlegm, but you still need coughing to clear it.   

I prefer to take an expectorant during the day, and a cough suppressant at night to help me (and others) sleep."
14076,best place to get free books,Don't forget price and repairability.

47645,best state to visit in the United States,"Also if you're into beer, there's about a million and one craft breweries in Colorado."
73600,best battery bank,"Yeah. My first reaction to a 100W charger that cheap is ""uh... probably not."" Seems like there's chargers that can charge at 100W but only output 60W. 

Edit: The details only mention **input** at 100W and do not make any claims about output. 

Even if you can get a refund, that's shipping and time spent.

Is there a reason you're interested in a power bank with those specs at that price point, from a budget perspective?"
44134,best items under $100,"Seconded. Doesn't even have to be an expensive pair. Just get some trainers, go out, enjoy nature, get fit, enjoy life :)"
42193,movies like Inception,"Check out Dagon if you haven't already, it's a good one.  Not as good as In the Mouth of Madness, but it has a good, fishy Lovecraft vibe."
18478,best YouTube video,"The angels sung out, in immaculate chorus, down from the heavens descended chuck Norris, he delivered a kick that could shatter bones, into the crotch of old Indiana Jones, he fell over on the ground, writhing in pain, as Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne, but chuck saw through his clever disguise, and crushed Batman’s head in between his thighs"
26803,best board games,"I really like player interaction that isn't direct combat. Catan has tones of player interaction that I love. Its also simple to teach and beginners pick it up easily. Ill play it anytime.  The worst game of Catan I ever had was when someone managed to control all the wheat that wasnt a 2 or 12.  He became the target of every robber. It caused the game to crawl. But you know it created a lot of yelling and funny memories. A table full of people yelling over the robber, constantly losing half your cards, constant debates of what a fair trade looks like.  Not many games could recreate that experience."
70641,best movies with a cool twist,"I agree. I went from extremely tense, to extremely confused, to extremely funny in such a short span of seconds. The rest of the film was, as with the entire re-watching experience, never to be intense again."
41720,movies like Inception,zack snyder’s sucker punch
61749,Best RPG game on PS4,Dark Souls and Bloodborne are definitely rpgs. You got many different builds and playstyles. Horizon is not even close to an RPG. Just cause it has an open world and some dialogue options does not make it an RPG. It's an open world action adventure game.

21300,best workout music,Theres vomit on his spaghetti already.
64383,best place to pirate mac apps reddit,"Strange, I haven't gotten a single ad at all. I have my DNS set to the AdGuard DNS which blocks all ads globally. I also set Safari up with the AdGuard extension as well and cranked up every privacy setting in Safari. I will take note of these sites later though, thanks!"
