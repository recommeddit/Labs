15106,I live in a very similar climate. Actually it gets colder and hotter here. One of my absolute favorites from where I live is the American Sycamore. I'm not sure what's native around you but these are beautiful long lived trees. You can't go wrong with an Oak or even something a bit odd like a Katsura could be really cool!,best tree for the garden

53669,"I want to emphasize, **don't** combine an **Expectorant** and a **Cough suppressant**.  
It's not harmful, but they are kind of working against each other. The expectorant loosens up the phlegm, but you still need coughing to clear it.   

I prefer to take an expectorant during the day, and a cough suppressant at night to help me (and others) sleep.",best medicine for a cold

73600,"Yeah. My first reaction to a 100W charger that cheap is ""uh... probably not."" Seems like there's chargers that can charge at 100W but only output 60W. 

Edit: The details only mention **input** at 100W and do not make any claims about output. 

Even if you can get a refund, that's shipping and time spent.

26803,"I really like player interaction that isn't direct combat. Catan has tones of player interaction that I love. Its also simple to teach and beginners pick it up easily. Ill play it anytime.  The worst game of Catan I ever had was when someone managed to control all the wheat that wasnt a 2 or 12.  He became the target of every robber. It caused the game to crawl. But you know it created a lot of yelling and funny memories. A table full of people yelling over the robber, constantly losing half your cards, constant debates of what a fair trade looks like.  Not many games could recreate that experience.",best board games
