"lol yeah cool discussion, and I find it important that people value percussionists do. A lot of what we play is a lot more complex than at first glance."

I like the lily cup much better. I can’t use tampons either but the lily cup is comfy.

"I would probably change around the order a bit, but I think this list is fine 

I might make some swaps like I would definitely have Ready To Die in there, so I think I’d swap it for Entroducing, I think that’s the weakest link. 

Liquid Swords is overrated imo, if I were to put one of Wu Tang’s solo it would be only built 4 Cuban link, but I’m not sure it would be in my top 10 

Piñata is a personal favourite so I’ll swap it for Liquid Swords 

Atrocity Exhibiton never stood out to me like it did a lot others so I’d probably have the last spot be a tie between The College Dropout, Marshall Mathers LP and maybe something by 2pac or Outkast 

But this still looks pretty good to me


Edit: Forgot Lifestyle Ov Da Poor And Dangerous, that’s very easy top 10 for me"
"Hi there, Arizonan here. Bring water if you plan on going outside in the summer. Bring about 4x what you expect to drink. Bring sunscreen and a floppy hat. And for fuck's sake, wear comfortable walking shoes.

I've seen too many tourists dressed like they're visiting Santa Monica. Yeah, the sun might feel nice for the first five minutes, but your pasty ass will get scorched red in an hour.

Don't pet snakes that wag their tails at you. They are not happy to see you.

Arizona is a beautiful place if you come prepared!"
"Katie Holmes was really nice 

Though I met her in 2000, she could have changed.

I was turning in my “your tables ready” buzzer at a restaurant called Dockside, in Wrightsville Beach, NC. She was picking hers up. I was 10 and the buzzer technology was new to me and I thought it was really cool. So, being the outgoing chatty 10 year old I was, I just started talking to her “wow! These things are really neat! You can walk around and it just lets you know when your table is ready!”

And we just chatted for a bit. I told her she looked familiar. She said she was filming a TV show called Dawson’s Creek. I told her that I’d check it out sometime. And she said great, and if I ran into her again, to let her know if I liked it. And winked and said not to be afraid to be honest. 

Then I skiddadled off with my family to have lunch. 

I had no idea who she was, but I did realize something was up when I got swarmed by wife eyed teenage girls who had been watching me casually talk with a tv star."
"In my experience 48"" is just too big.  It's an amazing monitor, but even wall mounted at the end of a 36"" desk, it's still too close for me."
"Considering they have no always on screen, I don’t see too much value in putting it face up anyway. Looks better face down and presumably preserves some battery when the screen doesn’t turn on for notifications."

You’re just being pedantic now. The point is that student loans are not an issue for those who manage to actually make to the true neurosurgeon point.
