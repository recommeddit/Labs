"1. K-On!! - Fun things are fun

2. Aria - Provided me with almost two months of good night sleeps

3. Gurren Lagann - Did raw hype before Symphogear was cool

4. Monogatari Series - It goes for mystery, drama, romance, ecchi, comedy, meta, supernatural, and coming of age. And it does all of them well

5. Mob Psycho 100 - Refreshingly off-beat comedy and a surprisingly endearing art style with a nice thematic backbone tying it all together"
Everyone suggesting classic thrillers and there's me thinking my favourite twist will always be in Crazy Stupid Love. Who expects a twist in a rom com and it starts one of my favourite scenes.
Because its objectively wrong.
"Yeah, I can see how that could bother some people... Does it help with partial application?"
"The Loki scenes were fun.

But yeah. Otherwise it's one of the handful of MCU films I never once felt the desire to revisit."
"It is not enough, as that sentence tells you. There is a 40% chance that the differences are due to chance. However, the next sentence, ""Length of stay in hospital and duration of fever were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively)"" tells you that the length of stay and fever duration were significantly shorter, with 1% and 4% chances of error respectively."
I love HER by Narciso Rodriguez.
"Coyote by Allen Steele is AMAZING and hands-down my favorite sci-fi novel. Caves of Steel by Isaac Asimov, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, 1984, Brave New World are all essentials. And if you can stand some gore/psycho thriller aspects, The Sparrow by Mary Doris Russell."
"Funny, no such things."
You rate life after death over ready to die? How come man you just think more solid overall?
That's what she said
End of ze world. Predates YouTube but is a must see.
Mulah Mitch as well.
Excellence Playa Mujeres for so many reasons!!!!
I'd say that their Gram lineup of laptops have a pretty good reputation.
I too moved from Opera -> Firefox (+Vivaldi as the number 2)
"Every time I traveled abroad, I stayed in AirBnBs or tiny places with a ton of character.  It never cost that much, and it's much more worth it to us to have a cool place than a ton of luxuries.  Our favorite, so far, has been [Tashitakge in Lhasa](https://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/lhasa-babao.html).

I do travel a fair bit around the US for work, and as a solo-traveler, and I get comped a lot of suites (I guess they know as a single traveler, they know I won't ever pay for it, while a family of four might spring for it?).  By far, my favorite hotel in the US is the Adolphus in Dallas.  Ton of character, amazing bar, great gym, even the regular rooms are huge, has a great coffee shop and barbershop attached, it's right in the middle of the city.  It kind of makes other US hotels, even 4-5 star ones, seem kind of dingy."
"I bought a dog for $30. 

Real love, there."
"Most people I've talked to about RomerG switches who didn't like them complained about the squish at the bottom and compared them to membrane keyboards. That, and the first keyboard to use them (G910) had those awful keycaps. So glad my G410 has the standard smooth tops - it's a great keyboard and it's been on sale lately for $60."
Hash browns and hot buttery toast.
If thats the case then I apologise for posting irrevelant comment.
"Yeah look being an Aussie I'm definitely biased and think we could field an A and B team that would probably be the top 2, I was just curious as to who people thought would be runner up, India has some phenomenal batsmen and Windies is definitely my pick behind Aus they've got the bowling attack to back up there hitters I just though it would be a good conversation starter"

"So, I'm in the same boat (except I already have 2 dogs).

I picked up a 55 gal tank with a load of reptile stuff on the cheap.  Picked up a few other things, got the tank temps stable for a Bearded Dragon, and was ready to bring my 3.5 year old to pick out her new pet.  She's been asking about her dragon for about 2 weeks at this point, and honestly, I've always wanted a beardy too.

At the store with my wife, 3.5 year old and 9 month old.  Wife stumbles across a sign that says reptiles are NOT recommended for households with kids under 5 due to salmonella risks.  Instantly shut the whole thing down, understandably.  I didn't even think about salmonella risks, mostly because I know about proper hygein and cleaning for reptile pets (had turtles once upon a time).  So, now I have this 55 gal tank and stand.  Lights, accessories, whole nine yards.  Nothing to put in it.  Rodents are a no go, reptiles are a no go, and fish are a no go.  I've been thinking about what to put in this tank.

I stumbled across the idea of Hermit Crabs.  They carry no human-communicable diseases.  Extremely social and do well in groups.  Colorful shells.  Like to climb.  Fairly easy upkeep from what I've read.

Might be a good idea?  Not really something you pet, but you can hold em in your hand I suppose.  Anybody of experience with these lil guys?"
RHEL undoubtedly. Just check their hardware and software compatibility matrix and you'll understand why.
