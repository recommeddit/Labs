46767,"My hobbies(which include metal working) comes with a few minor cuts and scrubs on a regular basis and I have found that while crappy dollar store band-aids do suffice for this use.

And I have actually found dollar store duct-tape to be more flexible and the glue less prone to drying out than other cheap/china duct-tapes.

Personally I tend to use the local variation of denatured alcohol, which doesn't have poison in it but an ipecac like regurgitative in it and it is also prohibited by law from containing methanol, don't know about the US but there should be a a local equivalent available(EverClear??) as an alternative to over priced and scarce hand-sanitizer(isopropyl alcohol(rubbing alcohol) also works according to the CDC)..",best hand santizer brand
