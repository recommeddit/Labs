"I received a degree from The University of Maryland University College online a couple years back, I do not attribute my high pay to the degree, but it is a decent accomplishment. In the eyes of employers, it is that you finished what you started. The degree is in Cybersecurity, coupled with many industry certifications, I make close to 100k in the states, and over 200k overseas contracting. Mind you I am only 26. It is what you make of it. Depends on how far you want to go within your career, and why you are picking an online program. My advice, if you can, go traditional PT. If you are unable, kids, jobs, remote location, then online is a fine runner up.  With all that being said, most of the comments are correct about online for-profit vs. non-profit. Schools like UMUC, are part of the State of Maryland University system, most people won't bat an eye if you but University of Maryland-UC on your resume, there is also College Park, Baltimore and a couple other schools in that system. But places like Phoenix and Virginia College, which or private-for-profit institutions, I would stay away from."
"I travel, A lot. Hint: Don't pack valuables in your Checked Bag. Only Clothing goes there, let them take my dirty underwear. All electronics, jewelry and everything else of value stays with on you or in your carry-on bag. End of story."

"This is how fevers work; they can make us better by making our body too hot for the invader to reproduce/live. However, DO be careful to not dehydrate or elevate your core temp over 101 or you could hurt yourself."
I purchased it off Amazon from the OtterBox section they have. It clearly said “OtterBox Symmetry Series Case for iPhone 13 Pro Max and IPhone 12 Pro Max”. Will definitely be returning it
Nice catch!

"If you want a small, easy-to-see city, may I recommend Richmond? I lived there for over a decade. Great food, interesting history, gorgeous architecture, and two hours each from a major city (DC), the mountains, and the beach."
ft (san cat) is pretty fun and the most social dorm i would say. it also has a nice dining commons which is less hectic and more open. there’s a real sense of community. it is way further from classes than other dorms though.
"My boyfriend has a swiss gear that I have used.  They don't seem to have any with waist straps which is a disadvantage.  Also, all of their backpacks are too big for me- they don't do packs for smaller-framed people.

Other than that, they are sturdy, dependable packs.  A zipper did break in our pack, but it took a couple of years."
"Hmm. Budget is around $150 to $200.
What size do you suggest for 27"" iMac? I think I'll neee a medium to large tablet."

"Look man. I'm currently a 1st year at UCSB and staying at Santa Rosa.

In my opinion - Santa Cruz/Anacapa are both good and equal. Then I'd go with Santa Rosa, San Nic, then San Miguel. I don't like how far FT is personally, but people do like it there too. Anyways, go with Santa Cruz/Anacapa."
"Phoenix. Ugh. ""Gotham of the desert,"" as I call it. But if you're into a bunch of beige colored sprawl, it's just the place for you.

Go to Santa Fe instead."
