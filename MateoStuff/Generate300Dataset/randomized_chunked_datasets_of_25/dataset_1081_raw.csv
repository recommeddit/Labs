"In Iowa, there honestly isn't much. The Grotto is really interesting to see, and Field of Dreams is fun if you like the movie.  Pikes Peak State Park has probably the best views, especially of the Mississippi river.  Otherwise Des Moines has lots of fun things to see and do and has some really cool architecture if you're into that."
">  Then they shifted to arcade and this time arcade community ignored them.

Even with how arcadey PC3 is compared to even PC2/1, it's not exactly an arcade.

I agree SMS are a bunch of assholes though."
Menards is my number one for most things. Ace is a second since they are usually closer.
And here I thought The Locust stopped touring
"Yes, This one"
"My husband wears Aqua di Gio and it's delicious. Not much of a cologne girl but this stuff smells fantastic. 

Sephora sells a sampler pack of colognes that is worth picking up if you're looking for something new. It comes with a coupon that gets you a full-sized bottle of whatever scent from the sampler that you end up liking. Good deal!"
I was surprised that despite this sub hating Akshay so much many have picked Akshay as one of their favourite actor......üòÅüòÅ
"You'll never be admitted into my gentleman's club dressed like a fool. Pah. Odd socks, indeed. Slovenly riffraff."
A Kindle and nice over-ear headphones
Try debt vs. expected earnings.
You could make a religion out of that
"iRacing is brilliant, but pretty expensive. If you're looking for something less expensive, Assetto Corsa is just as good."
Basically anywhere ZooMed makes one they sell at Petco and PetSmart or order one on amazon
"I used to work at a fragrance counter where we would refill Star and Alien bottles.  We used to do anything to get out of having to do it.  When you do the refil you invariably spill a bit and the smell goes everywhere.  That stuff is so strong and lasts forever!  

I know folks love it - but if I never smell it again I will not feel like I have missed anything."
My house plant gives me 200 grams of weed every hundred days or so...
Use superfloss by OralB. I have a bar behind my teeth and use it religiously ! It has a plastic end on the floss that threads through the bar.
The treaty of Versailles was a bad idea. The Marshall Plan was how it should have been handled from the beginning.
My wife and I get very few kids since we live on a busy road so we always give out full size m&m our snickers. If you come late enough you might get 2-3 depending. Great costumes get $2 bills as well. (I Don‚Äôt Know if I‚Äôll have $2s this year though banks gotta get them in time)
There is no amount of money that would help someone who just doesn't have the skills to be a maintainer in charge of a team. The long-term focus and management skills coupled with development skills? Very few people fit the bill. I'm not sure what the solution is. It's easy to say they should hand it over to a team but finding a team and managing the handover is also difficult.
Yeah but would you want a president that isn't successful. Understanding money is important when running a country.
"i bought the kurt glasses for $2 in chinatown and they look decent and have good build quality, wouldn't wanna spend $350 on something that's a meme. (never wore them as real shades though)"
"yeah, that's why i was unsure if it was or not. sort of in the same vein, i consider persona in there as well"
Isn't it true that only 50% of law school graduates get a job in law? There are a lot of lawyers these days.
"You know, there are pen pal type groups you could join. I know its not the same as from your family, but its something you might wanna do: send and receive some Christmas mail."
I've only tried Sel Marin and Note de Yuzu from Heeley and I love them both.  Dying to order some samples of some others.  What else do you recommend from them?
