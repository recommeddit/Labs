16876,best pet for toddlers,"They smell fucking weird and are nocturnal so they make chirpy noises all night.


Also, they smell weird.


Did I mention they smell weird? Because they smell weird."
2345,best headphones,What about sennhiesers HD8
19197,best YouTube video,"Slowly, slowly, slowly ******* faster"
1801,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Isn’t that the one that is haunted?  Or is that just your pride that haunts you for going to that one?
27917,best breakfast foods,Bacon topped with bacon with a side of bacon. Oh and orange juice.
45744,best trick or treating candy,Store bought popcorn balls weren't bad
43441,best ad service for mobile applications,"That's true. I do know our marketing team are currently making a more comprehensive front page as we speak. 

We only soft launched the site 2 weeks ago, I just wanted to share with OP as it sounds like he's in the same boat we were when we made Enhance."
28185,best breakfast foods,"I dislike 'sweet' sweet potatoes usually - like sweet potato pie or casserole. But I like the 'savory' sweet potatoes like hash browns and in stir fry. If, perhaps, you've only ever had them sweet, you might like them savory better. IMO, they're better with salt & fat than they are with sugar :)"
59682,best perfume,"Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet is a beautiful light peony and rose.

Versace Yellow Diamond (EdT) is a pretty fruity floral, quite affordable too.

Many Jo Malones will check that box, Bluebell is a nice one.

MMM Springtime in a Park is a nice fresh floral with lovely green notes."
63385,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,There is Milkyway fix for iOS 14 from Brandon repo . This way milkyway2 (free) works on iOS14.
30660,best Mexican war to study,"This question pops up from time to time.  I'll repost my last answer. It's not by any means exhaustive. Maybe someone else has some recommendations.

A very good one is John Mason Hart's *Revolutionary Mexico*: it's pretty commonly used.   Friedrich Katz's *The Life and Times of Pancho Villa* is a truly excellent - and careful- biography that sorts out a lot of legend from reality- but it's not a thin book, you'll need some time to go through it. Brenner's venerable *The Wind that Swept Mexico* has a simplistic and dated text, but includes a lot of great photos ( some classic ones) and used copies of it are common. 

An excellent TV documentary, *The Storm that Swept Mexico*, is now over on [YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVWcgOcvgV0)"
5806,best programming language for web development,What would you recommend instead?
58710,best cologne,Longevity/Performance is not solid.. it smells great but doesn't last long. I think Eros Edt was a better performer and I believe its Edp version should be even stronger imo but im yet to try it.
22218,best celebrity,"I once met Ryan Braun, a baseball player from the Brewers.  He happened to walk into a Qdoba after a game (that I had attended) one night.  The place was empty except for my girlfriend and myself.  He saw us looking at him and he came right up to us and offered to take a picture with us and sign autographs.  On TV, he definitely comes across as a rather cocky guy, but in person he was cool as hell."
59452,best perfume,How is the longevity and performance of Ichnusa compared to Phylisikos?
43653,best items under $100,I agree.
65840,best college in california,"Real cost is not 30k-40k. The UC's have been targeting the middle class for new scholarship and financial aid programs. My parents made about 190k combined and after their contribution (10k a year or so) and financial aid I only came away about 25k in debt. 

The UC's may be an option for you children."
46108,best trick or treating candy,"It’s just that when you forget the sarcasm tag, people will assume you’re a dick.

Maybe I should have just applied Hanlon’s Razor to your comment?"
463,best terminal file manager reddit,This looks quite interesting. Probably going to start using it on my Pi since ranger has been a little slow on it.
