28185,"I dislike 'sweet' sweet potatoes usually - like sweet potato pie or casserole. But I like the 'savory' sweet potatoes like hash browns and in stir fry. If, perhaps, you've only ever had them sweet, you might like them savory better. IMO, they're better with salt & fat than they are with sugar :)",best breakfast foods

30660,"This question pops up from time to time.  I'll repost my last answer. It's not by any means exhaustive. Maybe someone else has some recommendations.

A very good one is John Mason Hart's *Revolutionary Mexico*: it's pretty commonly used.   Friedrich Katz's *The Life and Times of Pancho Villa* is a truly excellent - and careful- biography that sorts out a lot of legend from reality- but it's not a thin book, you'll need some time to go through it. Brenner's venerable *The Wind that Swept Mexico* has a simplistic and dated text, but includes a lot of great photos ( some classic ones) and used copies of it are common. 

An excellent TV documentary, *The Storm that Swept Mexico*, is now over on [YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVWcgOcvgV0)",best Mexican war to study

22218,"I once met Ryan Braun, a baseball player from the Brewers.  He happened to walk into a Qdoba after a game (that I had attended) one night.  The place was empty except for my girlfriend and myself.  He saw us looking at him and he came right up to us and offered to take a picture with us and sign autographs.  On TV, he definitely comes across as a rather cocky guy, but in person he was cool as hell.",best celebrity
