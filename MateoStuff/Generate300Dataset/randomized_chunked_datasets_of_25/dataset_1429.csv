32578,"Yes.  Your patronage in their country is aiding the surrounding community.  Resorts hire locals.  The money you pay a resort is given to the employees.  The employees better their lives with said money.

Is it a 1:1 exchange?  Do the locals get every dime spent when booking a room at a resort?  No.  But I guarantee it's more than they would make if you refuse to go.",best vacation resort

1473,"Oh my gosh!  His book is AMAZING!  Totally worth the purchase.  I got a used copy on Amazon that didn’t cost too much.  There are a lot of illustrated guides that really help out, especially if you’re new to making ice cream like me. Also, he has really funny anecdotes at the beginning of each recipe that I love.  It’s probably one of my top 5 favorite cookbooks.  

Edit to add:  He has whole chapters with recipes for add ins, toppings, cones, etc.  Some of his topping and mix in recipes are the bomb.  He’s a pastry chef so there’s a lot of really unique stuff.",best ice cream flavor
