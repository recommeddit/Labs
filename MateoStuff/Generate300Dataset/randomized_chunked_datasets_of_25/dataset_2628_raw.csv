don't these affect the wireless charging though if its specifically not magsafe case? or am i mistaken
Very true. I'd still any of the games on this list.
Oneirology (Cunninlynguists) is probably pretty underrated.  Kno is an incredible producer.

"Based off what you listed, I’d suggest midsummer murders. And father brown. 

Can’t explain why exactly, but I’ve watched and enjoyed much of your list and I extremely enjoy both of those."
"I'd pick ""I Stand Alone"""
"Good point. Ahh... It's a tough one, I'm so tempted to start gaming now though. How about a few games for PC. Any suggestions?

My current machine isn't really built for gaming, which is why I was looking into consoles.

I appreciate your response btw, wasn't expecting comments this quick!"

I was surprised that Will Farrel only wanted to construct an institution for kids who don't read really really good for ants. What a dick!!!
dahlia and vines by nest gets me the most compliments from other women—men don't typically compliment me.

I’ll give you that.  But never the less still very good and well done.
This is fantastic. Thanks for articulating your thoughts in such a well-edited post.
"YES! This used to literally get adrenaline pumping threw my blood... I used to be scared to death of roller-coasters, but I loved them once I was on one. So one day I was with a bunch of friends and we were going on one (this one http://florida-holiday1.blogspot.com/2010/05/top-10-universal-studios-florida.html ) which looked scary as hell. I didn't wanna back out in front of my friends, so I waited in line to get on this ride for half an hour. If someone said much as 5 words to me I might cry. I was extremely nervous and on the verge of tears (but backing out was not an option). I am shaking now just thinking of it. Also on this roller-coaster you get to pick your song that you listen to. Now I had heard this song once or twice before (my brother played it for me) and it was familiar to me so that's why I chose it. I remember shaking extremely uncontrollably and barely being able to press buttons on a screen while wanting to throw up all over the seat. As the ride starts it goes exactly straight up. I couldn't even hear the music because all I could hear was the pumping of blood in my ears and the clik clik clik of the roller-coaster. As we reached the apex I had a literal death grip on the shoulder harness. My heart is racing and I am scared to death. We start down the first drop and my eyes are completely closed, every muscle in my body was flexed holding me down. For the first 2-3 seconds after the first drop I stayed exactly like this. Then I heard it. The music in the back ground. Immediately I felt a rush through me and my eyes burst open! I release my death and throw my hands up with the intense look of a psychopath on my face. I had never put my hands up on roller-coasters (even if I'm not scared I always have a death grip on what ever is securing me). But now my hands up as high as I could get them. I feared nothing. I felt immortal. I felt powerful. As the ride ended and I got off I was still shaking but not from being scared but from the intense power that I felt. My friends all thought the ride was ""awesome"", while I felt it was insane. For the next 2-3 minutes this feeling of ""power"" stayed with me but eventually faded away. For awhile anytime I heard this song I would get an insane adrenaline rush (never as strong as the first time sadly). I don't get nearly as nervous when going on a roller-coaster now because of this.

TLDR; Read it.

Edit: Just realized this is my longest post ever and most likely no one will read it."

"Ohhh okay. I think I understand a bit better now. Yeah the way I was asking must’ve sounded very incoherent, my bad. I don’t really know how to properly ask questions without sounding like I’m listing things. 

If minerals are used as some sort of flavour for water, are they not that beneficial for health in comparison to pure, filtered water? I always assumed that the amount of minerals that were in water meant that it’s more healthy."
"Zorin OS is based on ubuntu so basically you can run the same apps but with better user interface in my op, as for fedora on my 5 month or so i haven't faced an issue where i couldn't install what i want (actually fedora does have what is called fedora labs basically fedora with preinstalled software for different purposes: security, science, astronomy and more, actually you might find it helpful to check this page: [https://labs.fedoraproject.org/](https://labs.fedoraproject.org/)"
