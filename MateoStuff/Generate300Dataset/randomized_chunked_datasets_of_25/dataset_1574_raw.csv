"Violin.
For sure."
How do the AMD cards compare to the NVIDIA ones? Never really looked at AMD before?
"Depending on how close to be 1 the kid is, laying down a sheet (to avoid a mess) and giving the kid some finger paint to put on poster board was a gift I was really excited about. My daughter was almost 1 and did it just fine. 

Bonus points if you use hand print of fingers prints to make a heart."
"I'm a Laphroaig man. Distilled literally next door to Lagavulin, but smokier and half the price. The same can be said about Ardbeg but holy shit, that stuff, at 54% and 57% for some bottles, will put some lead in your pencil."
"Hi, what are you using your laptop for? Does battery life or weight matter?"
Sparks!  The drink that gets you drunk and hypes you up!

"I like the idea of painting after I’ve been in there a while, but wasn’t it a pain with your stuff there? As for the paint going with my things, it’ll be a redecorating because I’m coming with a bed and dresser lol studio living to a split level house. I’ve been pinning rooms on Pinterest, it’s just so hard to visualize it, I’m hoping that comes easier once the seller’s things are gone."

"I can't recommend places in that part of the country to visit but I can recommend something to give you ideas! 

[Stephen Fry in America](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFMTZrEhvlw&feature=related) is a fantastic, recent series produced by your own BBC. It's on Netflix streaming and on Youtube. It's split over six episodes, each covering a different part of our country!"

I know. Much more expensive though. But if you let me choose again I would probably go for the Pro.
"what I normally do when I have canker sores is to dab a salt on them. It will burn like a bitch for a few minutes, but then you'd be so numb to it and it helps it heal faster."
What's your budget? And goals?
Seen a few Borat references today on here. I don't mind.
"Ah awesome! Love shows like that, almost make you feel part of the show! Looks and feels kinda like arrested development, which I’m SO excited about"
"The Stars My Destination is dripping with schlock. It is so pulpy that it'd make an orange blush.

But I love it."
"9xbuddy's the only extractor that I know of. Sometimes I just do a google search on the audiobook that I want. Check out r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH, too!"
"[Scott Sterling! The man, The Myth, The legend](https://m.youtube.com/watch?index=497&list=LLY5bMp9TUTu0PzrVbvDUi9g&v=8F9jXYOH2c0)

It is some great slapstick sports comedy."
"The uke is a great way to go.  String it ""low G"" and you basically have a small guitar.  Full electric ones exist if you want to play entirely on headphones with little outside noise, but acoustic are better.  Easy to learn fun to play."
"Chrome by Azzaro

And Aqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani

However, I just bought a new cologne and smells pretty damn good. It’s called “Mont Blanc Legend”. Highly recommend"
Nfsmw black edition is the whole reason I built my PC with a cd drive. Game is still insanely fun and looks great with a couple of mods.
"Ha! Bibi Ji - hopefully they have their shit together and fired the rude bitch waitress. Went their twice based on friends' recommendation when they first opened. First time we went the RB at the door would not take a reservation and became very rude/condescending to the woman in our group that was trying to make the reservation (oh, that's right, that's their culture /sar). She ended up also being our very rude waitress. 

Second time we went she again was our waitress who became rude when we asked about items on the menu. She got our order wrong, did not deliver all of the food we had ordered but was included on our bill - oh yeah, and charged us for two rounds of drinks when we only received one round. When we pointed that out instead of taking the second round off the bill, the second round suddenly arrives as we are trying to leave!!! At one point we actually started talking about just walking out, then the owner stopped by the table and apologized. Fuck this place if that rude bitch still works there. 

The food is pretty good so it's too bad that they have someone working there that is so rude we will never consider going there again."
"Catastrophe is a great show! And if you’re not in the UK, it’s available on Amazon Prime."
