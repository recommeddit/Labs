If you like gaming and have  social media, they integrate Twitch, Instagram, Whatsapp and Discord. You can change your background for the home screen and change the outline of it too. (Meaning what color the borders and tabs look like) also has built in VPN that is decent, RAM Limiter and other features too.",best web browser

32480,"Well I chose Grand Oasis Cancun, in Cancun.  I didn't go yet but the reason why I chose that place over others were these reasons:

* It is attached to Oasis Cancun, which apparently is known as a ""young people"" resort due to the cheaper rooms.  It is basically an all-inclusive 3 star resort which attracts the young college/professionals crowd.  Yet the Grand Oasis is considered 3.5-4 stars so I get to sleep in the good spot and walk over to the party.
* Because it is the Grand Oasis Cancun I will have access to everything on Oasis Cancun and Grand Oasis Cancun.  According to reviews if you can pay the extra money (for me it was about $130+ more) then it is worth it since you avoid the long lines for food and drinks at Oasis Cancun since Grand Oasis has it's own private bars and restaurants.  Less lines = more drinks :P
* The only other resorts that came close to advertising a ""party atmosphere"" were Temptations and Hard Rock.  If you want to shell out the money then Hard Rock sounds great, but it's quite a bit more expensive (I would've had to pay $200+ and I would've lost 3 nights).  And Temptations sounds interesting for another time, but it seemed to have the reputation of being a ""swingers resort"" which me and my friends were not really interested in.",best vacation resort
4731,"HD nearly all day long. I only have HD and Menards near me. HD is closer drive. There used to be a Lowe's but they closed down (and it was a 20 minute drive, now the closest is nearly 45 minutes)

HD seems to have more knowledgable people near me that actually go out of their way to ask if you need help, but aren't annoying about it. The Menards near me it's difficult to find even one associate without walking halfway across the store.

I bought studs from Menards one time and nearly every one was warped in the store. I sorted through at least 30 before setting on just 10. The 10 I got home had warped just laying flat on the floor after a few days.

I still have studs from HD from months ago that are just fine that have been through the late winter and humidity of the spring, A/C, etc. Sad part is there's a Menards Distro center on the other side of town, so shouldn't have any excuses for poor products or out of stock stuff (which is rampant at this Menards)

The screws from Menards suck, HD has those ""SPAX"" self pilot screws (WITH the bit!), those things I can buzz into the wood all day without drilling pilots. Very nice.",best home improvement store

6468,"Watch Cocaine Cowboys.  It's an INCREDIBLE documentary that chronicles the cocaine boom of the 80s and just how influential it was to the city of Miami.  It's narrated by smugglers, dealers, enforcers, hit-men,  etc.  I'm a sucker for all kinds of documentaries and this one is definitely in my top 5.  Cocaine Cowboys 2 is also good, but the story is mostly narrated by a single person, whereas the first Cocaine Cowboys is narrated by many different people who were in the business.",best Netflix documentary
