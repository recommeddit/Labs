44257,best items under $100,"Buy an external hard drive. You can get a well-made, relatively large capacity (1 TB or more) for less than $100. Many redditors probably already own one, but learning that you should back up your data the hard way is never fun."
62821,Best Data Science textbook,I thought [Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Analytics-ebook-dp-B013FHC8CM/dp/B013FHC8CM/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) by Kelleher et al was really informative and well written!

47434,best state to visit in the United States,Yep. Colorado is a pretty awesome place. Awesome scenery and the good bud :)
54986,best water filter,"As has been stated here in many posts, tap-water here in the US is generally safe. However just because it's safe to drink doesn't mean it tastes good. For instance in Texas, our water came from a lake. For a good part of the year the water would taste horrible (like dirt). I'm sure that the water was still safe to drink, it was just hard to drink. So my family bought a Brita, and the water was actually bearable to drink."

64883,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Bree’osh is an awesome breakfast cafe in Montecito
58425,best cologne,"Whether how and why woman are attracted to the smell of man's is actually very interesting and there are some good ideas so far as to why, for example; 

Firstly it involves the sweat on a man and whether a woman is attracted to  this is dependent on many things such as the man's attractiveness, where the woman is ovulating or whether she has had sex with them. 

This is to do with sexual biology and has been influenced by evolution for instance if a men genetics make him look less attractive he is more likely to mate, if his sweat smells good to the opposition sex. Whereas on the other hand a man who is attractive, his genetics are less likely to be pasted on if he has sex with a woman when she isn't ovulating so to help this his sweat can smell bad to a woman who isn't. 

(i don't clam to know that much on this topic so I may be wrong on a few points but I thought some people might find this interesting)"

65217,best phone service company,"My understanding was that AT&T prepaid was deprioritized, although I may be mistaken about this. I've heard some people comment that just the AT&T Prepaid Unlimited plan is deprioritized. The prepaid plans with set data amounts along with the Unlimited Plus plan may actually have priority data."
