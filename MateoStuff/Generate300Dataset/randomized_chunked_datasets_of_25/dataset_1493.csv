30022,"Up for Money Manager. Been using it for three years. At the time it was the only app I found with all the features I want : 

1. Multiple, customizable accounts (up to 12 for free I think?)
2. Fully customizable categories and subcategories (eg. Food --> Breakfast, Transportation --> Bus, Salary --> Bonus, Investment --> Dividends, etc. YES it's *that* detailed) 
3. Uploading of pictures (for receipts) 
4. You can add notes to each entry.
5. Bookmarks
6. Other apps have two major types of entries : Income and Expense. This one has three: Income, Expense and Transfer --> which is lovely if you use digital wallets all the time.
7. Daily, Weekly and Monthly views
8. Filter and Search of all entries and categories
9. Investment/Loan management
10. Budget --> Connected with your expenses/income categories
11. Export data to CSV (this is already available for Free version)
12. Widgets

Cons: It's an app catering to power users. Complicated set-up. The stats/reporting feature is pretty lacking (what I do is export my data and do my own analysis using Excel). It's also not very pretty. 

I think I'm forgetting a few more, it is really fully-packed with features ""OC"" people will love and minimalists will hate. I gush about the features of this app, but because it's already packed I haven't tried newer apps. I'm particularly piqued about the auto-connect with bank/credit card that others say other apps have.",best money managing app
