40940,best instrument to play,"Agreed, but as a sax player it takes longer to actually sound good compared to flutes or clarinets. Easier to play faster and more technical stuff, but harder to sound good doing it."

40227,best midrange CPU,"8 core still isn't that useful over 6 core in gaming. And if for content creation, if you're just a casual hobbyist 6 core still enough, and if you're more serious the 3900X is the better option."
56462,best desktop monitor,"G7 has very heavy matte coating. With that screen there is no white color, just some kind of yellow/braunish puke. Tried to upgrade from chg70, but no way i pay so much for a downgrade."
59805,best perfume,I got a free sample from Sephora and fell in love. Can’t wait to buy a full size bottle

38291,best newspapers to read,"The economist has excellent analysis of current issues. It may lean right, but when they dig into a story their coverage and analysis is solid, it's one of the best weekly publications still avaliable."
12363,best gifts for mom,"I’m going to throw up. It cost me $400 to fly round trip to a city not even half-way across my province. Pourquoi, Canada? Pourquoi???"

55717,best action and adventure novel series,War. Imagine *Band of Brothers* with swords and wizards.
46852,best hand santizer brand,"Sometimes.   When I'm camping I'll often bring sanitizer.   When you have to carry all your water with you, hand sanitizer is more convenient.   Sure I'm next to a lake, but I don't want soap polluting my lakes.  (I don't trust biodegradable soaps to actually degrade nicely)"
30022,best money managing app,"Up for Money Manager. Been using it for three years. At the time it was the only app I found with all the features I want : 

1. Multiple, customizable accounts (up to 12 for free I think?)
2. Fully customizable categories and subcategories (eg. Food --> Breakfast, Transportation --> Bus, Salary --> Bonus, Investment --> Dividends, etc. YES it's *that* detailed) 
3. Uploading of pictures (for receipts) 
4. You can add notes to each entry.
5. Bookmarks
6. Other apps have two major types of entries : Income and Expense. This one has three: Income, Expense and Transfer --> which is lovely if you use digital wallets all the time.
7. Daily, Weekly and Monthly views
8. Filter and Search of all entries and categories
9. Investment/Loan management
10. Budget --> Connected with your expenses/income categories
11. Export data to CSV (this is already available for Free version)
12. Widgets

Cons: It's an app catering to power users. Complicated set-up. The stats/reporting feature is pretty lacking (what I do is export my data and do my own analysis using Excel). It's also not very pretty. 

I think I'm forgetting a few more, it is really fully-packed with features ""OC"" people will love and minimalists will hate. I gush about the features of this app, but because it's already packed I haven't tried newer apps. I'm particularly piqued about the auto-connect with bank/credit card that others say other apps have."

30138,best Mexican war to study,"I always thought the whole ""stealing"" aspect was a really odd take...generally the venn diagram that is ""The US stole the land from Mexico"" and ""imperialism is a massive crime against humanity"" is basically a circle yet for some reason going imperial on a land that another country already went imperial on is somehow worse."

40363,best midrange GPU,"It's only ""officially"" supported on like a dozen monitors, but it should work on any -- can always google to find out for sure for a specific monitor :)"
12913,best gifts for mom,"A new pair of slippers. I like starting winter with a fresh pair. And some one else to make dinner.  Oh, and hand made cards! Always so corny,  but I keep them all.  
I think Mothers Day should be about getting something practical that I wouldn't really bother getting myself."
12956,best gifts for mom,For mother's day I'm gonna let her bring me breakfast in bed. I feel this is a nice compromise.

513,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"If you want full support, there’s the adobe suite, but nothing free comes to mind unfortunately. If you install the Wacom driver you should be able to set the hot buttons on the tablet to your preference though (such as color or stroke width) and that should work for most applications."
