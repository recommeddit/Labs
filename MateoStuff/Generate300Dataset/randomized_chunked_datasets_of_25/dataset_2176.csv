46738,"You are missing the most important part, in the paragraph below the list:   
""Methanol is significantly less toxic to most experimental animals than humans, because most animal species metabolize methanol differently. ""

**The lowest lethal dose for humans is listed at just 143mg/kg oral, and 428mg/kg dermal**   

Other MSDS show acute toxicity (single dose needed to produce toxic effects) of methanol in humans as 100mg/kg oral, and 300mg/kg dermal.   
(https://www.labchem.com/tools/msds/msds/VT430.pdf)

Also, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol, it is recommended that methanol be considered cumulative, so every individual dose added together.   

 According to the publication ""Methanol Toxicity"", Permanent visual damage can occur from a single 30ml oral dose.   
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482121/)

The same publication recommends, since the human body takes days to eliminate methanol,   
that methanol be considered cumulative, for purposes of treatment (all doses over days, added together, considered as total dose)


**Time for some real (and alarming) napkin math:**   

The lowest lethal dose by skin absorption, for your hypothetical 200lb (90.718kg) man,   
 would be just 38.8273 grams over multiple days.    

Worst case hand sanitizer tested so far in the ban list is Lavar Gel containing 81% Methanol   
 (47.9349 grams of sanitizer contains 38.8273 pure methanol)

Hand sanitizer weighs 0.875 g/cm3(ml) (data from purel advanced, cause it was the first MSDS I found)

The minimum amount needed per use to cover small hands is 3ml (source: https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(16)30690-3/abstract).    


**So, if the hypothetical 200lb man had small hands, just over 18 applications of Lavar Gel hand sanitizer, over a few days time, would be enough to potentially kill him.**   
Yea, worst case chosen for effect, however:   
If you are working in a customer-facing position, you probably sanitize your hands way more than that every shift.   
Even some of the lower tested ones on the ban list were over 20% methanol, so go ahead and multiply that by 4, and it would still be easy to get that much exposure in a job where you sanitize regularly.   
And this is just to kill them, the effects of Methanol toxicity start lower, and are really bad, some permanently damaging.


**TLDR; The potential for death and permanent damage is way higher than one imagines by skin application of methanol in contaminated hand sanitizer for the average worker**

Edited TLDR to specify contaminated hand sanitizer, the allowable amounts of methanol in proper hand sanitizer is too small of an amount to be worried about.",best hand santizer brand

8453,"For most of my patients, the only ingredients I care about are fluoride, which has the same concentration in all over-the-counter U.S. toothpastes, and potassium nitrate for the surprisingly large number of people with sensitivity. As others have mentioned, hands down the best toothpaste is the one that you will use; at the end of the day it is the mechanical disruption of plaque from the toothbrush, floss, ect, that has the biggest impact on both cavity risk and gum health.

That being said there are a few nuances to add:  
More and more brands are adding or upping the amount of sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) which is a cheap detergent that can cause an tissue sloughing reaction in some people. It's not harmful in the longterm, usually goes away, and most of the time people don't even realize they have it, but I still have a hard time being ok with it.

I also personally stay away from any toothpastes containing triclosan (such as the Colgate Total line), it's not my area of expertise but it has enough linkages with bacterial resistance and endocrine disruption that I choose to avoid it.

When it comes to whitening toothpastes, I have yet to hear an argument as to how or why they work. Because it is a cosmetic claim, the manufacturers do not have to provide any proof, and the independent literature has been unable to find any evidence that it has any whitening action. Along those lines I counsel my patient to avoid any toothpastes or rinses with hydrogen peroxide as I have heard some early discussion of a very very small increased cancer risk. Likewise, charcoal is often an enamel destroyer.

When it comes to the electric versus manual toothbrush debate, they are theoretically identical, but as many other have mentioned my hygienists can usually tell when someone makes the switch. There are a few studies showing that the timer function of the electric toothbrush is actually the key in that it gets people to brush longer.  

In short, I am a dentist, and have the classic, super cheap Crest Cavity Protection toothpaste in my bathroom that I put on a manual toothbrush and I use a WaterPik every night. I have no mouthwash in my apartment and my lone spool of floss lives in my travel bag.",best toothpaste

24566,"1. **Code Geass**. Why? Apart from one flaw, it has everything I want in an anime. A massive cast of awesome characters, great pacing with both slow/fast and light/dark themes, some mature topics handled respectfully, every single villain is relate-able and understandable, no major plot holes, epic first episode, and decent animation... downside is too much fan service...

2. **Sword Art Online Abridged** (By Something Witty Entertainment). Apart from Code Geass, the top 4 are really close calls. The original really made me upset, because I loved the first episode and hated every subsequent episode. SAOA fixed every mistake and then some, making a lovable cast of interesting characters, swapping the topic to mature topics handled respectfully, swapping the plot to be well paced and interesting, adding tons of humor... in terms of quality, it blows most official anime out of the water. Biggest weakness? Too short.

3. **Gurren Lagann**. Great story, characters, etc. The world and plot are a little... cheap. A few mature topics hidden away, but it's mostly childish fun. WHICH IS AWESOME.

4. **Assassination Classroom**. Awesome characters, awesome world, awesome pacing... I honestly can't remember what the downside was.

5. **Overlord**. Season one was mediocre, but season two is so perfect it demanded a spot in the top 5.

6. **Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood**. The first few episodes were pretty poorly paced, and I didn't like how weak the final villain felt, character-wise. It just felt over-the-top generic villain. Plus, there weren't as many mature topics as some of the anime above. Until recently, an obvious pick for my top 5.

7. **Youjo Senki**. Honestly, this anime deserves to be higher up the list, but it's suffering for three reasons. 1, it has a smaller cast than most of the above anime. 2, it's really short. 3, it's not worth rewatching a dozen times.

8. **One Punch Man**. Nice story, nice world, and it's always a pleasure to watch, but it has even less mature topics than Gurren Lagann...

9. **Log Horizon**. Yeah... Pretty much a sucker for Isekai. Still, the characters and story here are great. Pacing could do with some work.

10. **Infinite Ryvius**. A solid anime in terms of characters and plot, with a painfully slow start.

Honorable mentions in no particular order: **Steins;Gate** (Slow start, quickly became predictable, packs an emotional punch), **One Piece** (Pacing and story starts strong, degrade over time, but largest cast of awesome characters) and **7 Deadly Sins** (Great time, but pretty surface-level characters, for season 1).",best anime
