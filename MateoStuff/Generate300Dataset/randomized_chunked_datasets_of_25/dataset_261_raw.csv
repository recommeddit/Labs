"Basically all of this, same background and on my way up. All of my sketching paper is from dollar-store type places and I have rolls upon rolls of those MÅLA drawing paper rolls from Ikea because they're like $5 for 30 meters of paper and are very versatile in how you want to use them (I've used them because they have great dimensions for croquis and because I can tape sheets of them onto my walls so I can write and draw ideas down for projects.) It's a bit like starting out running or doing exercise. For the first long while you don't really need any fancy gear, all your shoes and clothes need to do is not get in your way of achieving results."

Nolan ripped off so many ideas and visuals from Paprika to make the inferior Inception.
"The simply Sonesta i stayed in Utah was great. It had a stove with plenty of pots and pans. A full sized fridge. A king size bed. Clean shower. A free laundry room with a little convenience store sort of thing they called the cupboard. There was a gym as well.

It was $58 a night but felt like it should have been twice that."

"I really didn’t want to like the movie; everything about it made me go “Why?!”, but then I was on a work trip and didn’t feel like spending the evening in my hotel so I went to the local theater and begrudgingly watched it.   Ended up really enjoying it. Was far better than it had any right to be."

">I suppose you could argue that the classiest form of action film is the adventure film, where a lot of the ""action"" is more cerebral. Lawrence of Arabia comes to mind

I love *Lawrence of Arabia*, but its not really an action film. To quote is co-star Omar Sharif, the film had ""no action, really, if you come to think of it"", and he's right. 

Whenever there's a potential for an action sequence, Lean plays it up less as fighting and more as a crowd scene: its not *action*, its *spectacle*. Indeed, during development, he encouraged his writers to downplay the fighting, asking sarcastically ""do we really want to make a western?!""

As for ""adventure"", it kind of is and kind of isn't. When O'Toole read an early draft he told Lean ""its the most marvellous adventure story"", to which Lean responded: ""Its *that* bad?"""
