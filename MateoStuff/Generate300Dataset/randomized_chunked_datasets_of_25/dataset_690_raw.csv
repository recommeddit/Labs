No. In the United States you must pass an exam in order to earn the CPA title. Source: I'm an accounting major.
"All these people talking shit on bottled water, ""why don't you just use tap water lolol"" have clearly never lived in an area where the local tap will give you some wicked runs if you drink it. Or in Flint, Michigan."
I read that in your moms voice too.

"I loved Yona of the Dawn, but I want another season from it, it was basically a prologue to the actual story, Yona the MC really grew into an awesome character by the end of it"
