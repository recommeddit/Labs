26692,best board games,"**Who are you going to play with**

I just looked through my games and the first couple I bought have barely been touched because they are too difficult for a lot of people/take a long time and play better with 4+

Now when I want to get a game I think will I play it with my wife/friends/gamer group and can I teach it to them (most of my friends like to play games and have a few drinks so could barely manage TTR the first time we played) and how long will it take since finding 4+ hours to play Game of thrones is a challenge in itself"

9582,best toothpaste,I would suggest using baking soda as it has a lower RDA (relative dentin abrasivitity) value than any toothpaste and its alkaline nature neutralizes acids and helps promote remineralization of the enamel. It also helps to whiten your teeth somewhat. Use a fluoride mouthwash afterwards.

8008,best laptop for general use,"Despite it being a 2-in-1 touchscreen device, it doesn't really charge a premium for that. It is one of the most powerful non-gaming 15.6"" laptops."
46375,best trick or treating candy,I would just hand out pieces of bite sized chocolate (Hershey's) to the kids (two each). If you let them grab it they may take a lot more. I would also just leave the lights on. I wouldn't want to put decorations out because it only attracts more kids. I just want to get it over with.

60070,best perfume,"Armaf Derby Clubhouse Gold. 100 ml for $20 and my wife can't get enough of it.

From what I can tell, Armaf has some amazing cheapies and clones, including several Creed knockoffs (Milestone for Millesime Imperial, Sillage for Silver Mountain Water) that some people actually prefer to the original."

Good shout on the racism thing. I never meant to imply it was better or worse than elsewhere, it was just... unexpected I guess. Worth pointing out I was in Amsterdam too. May have been different elsewhere, but I stand by that place being unfriendly if you come in with anything other than a whopper of a salary."
