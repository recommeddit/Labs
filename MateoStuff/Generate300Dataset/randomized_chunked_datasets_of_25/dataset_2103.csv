27688,best bollywood actor,"Aamir Khan is only actor whose fan  I can claim to be. 
My definition of fan is that I donâ€™t miss watching his movie in theatre. I wonâ€™t fight fanwars for him or try to find excuses for his offscreen behavior. 

I also think a fan should also criticize when needed. So my criticism for Thuggie was harsher than others ."

16042,best sunglasses for fashion,"I have an Asian person nose and I wear false eyelashes everyday so I can't wear most sunglasses. The only sunglasses I can wear are the ones with nose pads on adjustable wires and I'm terrified of breaking more expensive ones trying to extend them as far as they will go. I usually just buy them from discount stores or Forever 21. 

(I'm aware of Oakley sunglasses, I'm not a fan of their styles.)"

28870,best breakfast foods,"Hey everyone does things differently! I'm a mechanic and general contractor and just kinda naturally moved to eating light (if at all) during the day because, for me, it's tougher to squeeze under cars and into tight spots for plumbing and electrical with a full stomach. I also tend to get sluggish right after I eat and it slows me down. Even way back in high school, I skipped lunch a lot. If I have a big lunch, there's an hour or two I just don't get anything done haha. If I REALLY start feeling hungry, a smoothie will usually do the trick. I'm also on Wellbutrin to cut back on smoking, so that kinda kills my appetite even more.
 
It's a routine that works for me. I didn't mean to imply that it's what EVERYONE should do, just that it's what works for me. Different strokes."

66239,best soccer team in the world,"You have half the number of FA cup wins as we do for the Copa. That's a substantial difference, even if it is less prestigious than CL/league wins."
38565,best newspapers to read,"My sixth form college supplies each house room with a newspaper everyday that we are there, so when at school I read a newspaper every single weekday. But apart from that I only read one on occasion."
62651,Best RPG game on PS4,"That's awesome, thanks for sharing that. I'll definitely have to give that book a shot.

I didn't care for the Genesis version. I also enjoyed the newer Shadowrun Returns and Shadowrun Hong Kong games on PC a lot more than most did. They could have been a lot deeper in terms of the world but I enjoyed them for what they were.

I think it helps that I'm only casually into cyberpunk as a genre, so I don't know what it's ""supposed"" to look and feel like, if that makes sense."
16524,best pet for toddlers,"At that age I'd stick with a pet rock or one of those ZUMI robot-things. Nothing alive, not unless *you* are willing to take care of it."
