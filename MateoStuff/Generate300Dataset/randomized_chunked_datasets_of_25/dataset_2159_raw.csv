"I'm really picky about shapes because I feel like most of them look super odd next to my chubby cheeks. I generally prefer a vaguely cat eye-ish shape.

"In the Gion district in Kyoto, Japan, there is a Ryokan called Shiraume.  By far, the greatest hospitality I have ever experienced in a hotel, and I *work* in the hotel industry.  I went there for my honeymoon.  While expensive, it was worth it.  Easily the nicest people I've met.

"No, overclocking isn't required and you'll be able to run everything just fine without it.  However taking a couple hours to watch some guides and learn how to overclock will let you get a bonus ~10-15% extra performance.

For motherboard you'll need B450 or X470 chipsets.  B450 is cheaper and usually has all of the features you'll need so that would be my choice.  Brand doesn't matter too much, there are quality boards from all manufacturers, just check reviews for whatever you decide to buy."

I would also love to hear this podcast. I haven't been able to find one like it yet.
paradise and rosa are my top tiers but maybe i’m biased towards the sugar free flavours
I don’t know. That’s why I ask. Everyone is saying redux is past. Use hooks instead.
It's definitely supposed to be like that. If you go to LG's website for driver downloads it gives you the 85 drivers.
"Thanks! Your advise was pretty wise so I decided to buy 11 and wow, that’s a big difference after 4 years of using iPhone 7, literally, I almost forgot what it feels like using fast device. Thanks again man and everyone who replied to me!"
"I'll try to be as specific as I can:

* **Browsing**: feels faster. I don't know if it's just a feeling, but it feels a little faster than Chrome, both when launching it and when I browse websites. I jump from like Facebook to Twitter, to Twitch and so on and I don't feel like it has troubles making this operations. This doesn't mean that Chrome is slower, but Firefox feels smoother, which is probably the best word to describe it.
* **Addons and Extensions**: same story as Chrome but with few exceptions: a couple of extensions I had on chrome are not available in the Addons section of Firefox, but it's not really a downside. I'd say it could be better, cause the browser itself it's lighter this way, not having to load a lot of addons. Right now I have 7 addons on Firefox and 9 on Chrome. 
* **Possibility to change the way Firefox looks**: now this is something that I like, but never actually used. You can change stuff like button placements within Firefox itself to your liking, but it's something I haven't done cause I think it looks fine the way they programmed it, tho it's definitely a +1 for Firefox. Also there's a standard dark theme in Firefox, which I've never seen in Chrome, there if you want to have a dark theme you have to download it through the Chrome Web store app.
* **UI**: at first it's really messy, and you understand little to nothing. After 10/20 minutes of looking stuff throughout the option panel I figured it out, but it wasn't that easy of a task: Chrome has a more user-friendly option panel. 
* **Tabs in explorer**: now this is something purely subjective (and I can probably fix it but again I can't find anything in the option panel), but I hate that when I click on the Firefox icon in Windows it prompts all the tabs I have open within Firefox. While it could be useful from a certain point of view I just don't like it. When I click on something it has to do what it is supposed to do: open it, not telling me which one I want to open. Sure this can be fixed by navigating through different apps with Alt+Tab, but sometimes I like to use my mouse to navigate. Considering also that I like to navigate through tabs with ctrl+#, having the application to ask me which one I want to open it's stupid: it's obvious I want the last one I checked.
* **Shortctus**: This is neither a +1 or an issue, just something you have to get used to. Both share a couple of them, while others are not.

* **Conclusion**: absolutely you **have** to give Firefox a shot. It's a really well built browser, and I have the feeling that if you get used to it you'll switch to it with no problems whatsoever. Right now I still have Chrome as my default Browser, but I'm finding myself using Firefox more and more. It's just a matter of time. 

Hope that I've explained myself :)"
In the first viewing Age of Ultron I just walked out it was so fucking boring bro. Also I think it's the one of the worst MCU movies in my opinion

"Hey /r/mechanicalkeyboards!  Given /u/ripster55's recent addition of a [keyboard suggestion thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1uk1wb/official_rmechanicalkeyboards_keyboard_suggestion/) and the constant barrage of new threads we see where the OP asks which keyboard or switch is right for him/her, I figured it would be nice to have a good flowchart to help out beginners.  I've seen a few before, but none that were too thorough.

I could really use your feedback so that if there's anything you disagree with, I can make changes and add this guide to the wiki.  This flowchart includes the most common Cherry MX switches as well as buckling springs.  Topre and ALPS are not as common so I did not include them.  Similarly, I decided not to include the rarer Cherry MX switches, figuring beginners tend not to go looking for them.

I might make more flowcharts in the future, as well.  Maybe a flowchart for specific keyboard models, including size (fullsize/tenkeyless/compact), backlit, etc.

Let me know what you think!  Thanks!"

"I call shenanigans on this.  you ABSOLUTELY NEED A PAD IN YOUR HAMMOCK UNDER YOUR BAG or you will FREEZE YOUR ASS OFF.  Even in a sleeping bag, you will crush all of the insulation beneath you and all that's left between you and the cold breeze is 3 tiny layers of nylon.  If its super warm and you dont really need a bag, ok, but if its even a little bit chilly, you WILL wake up in the middle of the night shivering.  First hand knowledge, spent 7 months on the road primarily sleeping in my Hennesy Hammock and Big Agnes bag with the integrated sleeping pad slot."
