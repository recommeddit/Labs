37111,"My comment was mostly tounge in cheek, because obviously the more coasters you have, the more likely they will be ""ranked,"" the more likely you'll place high in these rankings.

I take umbridge with calling unranked coasters ""crap"" though. Wild Mice and kiddies aren't crap, they have their place, but of course you don't plan trips around them (unless you're me and my wife are least.).   I also love Mine Trains and Arrow Loopers, so maybe the rankers have shitty taste üòù.

But mostly I just heavily disagree with the rankings of the poll. I didn't vote so I can't complain, but wooden coasters aren't getting a fair shake by integrating them with the steels. RMCs are wayyy too inflated, and rides like Magnum are comically low. Same things I always complain about...",best amusement park

9767,"Santa Cruz and Anacapa have the best locations. They are actually on campus instead of a mile away like other dorms \(Santa Catalina/FT, Sierra Madre, etc.\) Both residence halls are across the street from the beach and a 5\-10 minute walk to classes. After that, I would say San Miguel, San Nic, Manzanita Village, and San Rafael because they are also on campus. Don't be tricked into choosing a farther dorm, it is a pain to have to bus or bike over a mile to class each day",best dorm hall at UCSB

X2, the ride I was most looking forward to, was incredibly rough, music wasnt working, and was in no way pleasant. Scream is one of my least favorite coasters. Aside from RR and Apocalypse, everything else I found to be mediocre. Very dissapointing visit.",best roller coaster at six flags

54777,"I plumbed in a sinktop faucet next to the tap water faucet using a Culligan kit. I replace the filter under the sink every six months. I have it on my Amazon Subscribe And Save list, so it comes automatically every six months, which reminds me to do it. The initial kit was $25 on sale, now it's $35. The replacement filters cost between $22 and $45, depending on the level of filtration you need.",best water filter
16016,"I want to be a one moderately-high-end pair sort of person, but apparently one of my most accomplished skills is the ability to lose sunglasses without a trace.  After losing the last pair I'm wrestling with myself over whether it's worth blowing another $150 on something I'll lose in a few months.  On the other hand, I've never found a pair of cheap frames that wasn't really poorly constructed and ended up being uncomfortable to wear.

Right now, I'm eyeballing the Ray Bans Wayfarers, but I'm on the lookout for something with a similar shape that doesn't have the logo because I'm not a huge fan of branding.",best sunglasses for fashion

16678,"Our rule (we have dogs and cats now) is no more pets until our kids can take (partial) responsibility for them. I don't believe a kid under 10 should be the sole caretaker for any animals, but that does depend on the kid...

 Once she's 5 or 6 a guinea pig might be a good choice; they're pretty hardy, low maintenance, and  she will be old enough to help you clean the cage & feed/water it.  Plus, you can get hairless ones (skinny pigs) if allergies are a concern.

12974,"Both of my brothers are notorious for putting zero thought into their presents for everybody and taking the easy way out. So this year I landed a great engineering job and thus have the money to get awesome presents. Instead of doing that however I've taken to figuring out what they both plan on getting our mother (I know they won't buy it till the last second) and then in a roundabout way I'll buy it for her and give it to her now and make it look like it was just a coincidence. 

I'm going to keep doing this until they pick a good present. I just bought her a stylus for her ipad last week and gave it to her under the guise that ""I already had an old one she could have"" when I came to town to visit. A STYLUS FOR CHRISTMAS TOM? REALLY?",best gifts for mom
