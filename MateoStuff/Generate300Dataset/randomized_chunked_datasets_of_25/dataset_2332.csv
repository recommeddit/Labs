I usually prefer animes with ""good"" endings. So Evangelion would not be on my list as well as most Urobutcher's work.   

Some of the animes I picked influenced Japanese culture so much that you can say ""neta"" (meme) to most people and they'd get it even they are not into animes at all. Like Yum Cha being super weak in Dragon Balls or Ken telling someone ""you are ready dead."" Or ""legs are for decorations only..."" or ""rocket boobs""...  but that's another topic.   

I didn't include **Steins;Gate** because I prefer the light novel more than the anime.   

I also like the novels of Welcome to NHK better than anime.   

Mirai Nikki is a tough one - the manga is better but it's also more confusing. Personally I prefer the manga but the anime isn't bad.  

Kore wa Zombie desu ka is great... for the light novel. The anime is alright. Same for High School DxD...    

Outbreak Company is just out and the verdict will have to wait. I always like Ichiro Sasaki's LN/script though. Same for No Game No Life, but so far so good.    

Akira has an awesome manga, if the animed movie got you hooked, you shouldn't miss it.   

While I like Code Geass and Lain, I don't think they are for everyone.  

In the Honorary Mentions I also *try not to repeat other people's suggestion*. Except for **Mushishi** and Angel Beats, I voted again because they are definitely worth a watch.",best anime

11431,"My dad is an intimidating man. He is covered in tattoos, and sports a handlebar mustache and a mullet. Lat year I bought a wolverine action figure. I used for paint and tape to build his facial hair and fill out the mullet. After I drew on some tattoos, it was a pretty close resemblance. He still has it in his workspace.


The year before that I got him 20 lighters (because I have a tendency to pocket his). I spelled out ""I <3 U "" in lighters and then hid the rest in unlikely places like in the toliet paper roll and in the coffee pot.",best gifts for dad

13602,"Many people are told, many people quickly forget. Either because they weren’t paying attention in the first place, were told poorly, professors don’t check sources, or have poor research habits. 

At my university there was a mandatory portion in one of the courses going through library resources. The professor was *terrible* at explaining how JSTOR worked. They made it seem so complicated that a lot of kids simply didn’t want to bother with sifting through the results. 

Few of my classes required more than what you would find at the bottom of a Wiki page for sources. With a reaction like yours, you’re probably in the smaller percentage of students that actually need access to these documents to do their work properly so you’re savvy. 

Most don’t need, so most don’t care.",best research paper archive

The only thing I don't like is that you can't swivel it left and right, idk why they decided to do that. Also the stand is quite deep so It takes some space on your desk in terms of depth.

The other option would be the viewsonic which also has nano ips. I'd buy the one which is cheaper",best gaming monitor

I have a friend I swap gifts with every xmas (always booze), if we just started handing each other $40 it would be silly.


Cash gifts are best for relationships that are asymmetrical -- my parents will likely always give me nicer things than I give them, so for them to give me cash makes sense.
