25993,"While I dislike Austin Petersen as a person (I think he's kinda arrogant) and I disagree with about half of what he says, I think he genuinely believes the things he's saying and actually understands why he believes them rather than just being a corporate shill, an idiot, or a partisan hack like so many politicians today. Even if he's wrong, which I think he is now and again, I don't think he's a liar or a shill.

As for politicians that I think are doing a good job, the best I could give you is maybe James Mattis (current Secretary of Defense), but he's more soldier than politician.",best politician

My top picks from each section:

Liberal - the New York Times and the Washington Post

Neutral - AP and Reuters

Conservative - Wall Street Journal and The Hill",best newspapers to read
24552,"In no particular order it goes something like this

1) Fate/Zero - One of the shows that cemented me as an anime fan. I loved pretty much the whole cast, and the conflict was superb I felt.

2) Gurenn Lagann - The show is well.... very animated. It was super stylish and had a unique charm that no other show has been able to replicate for me. The over the top action and characters were highly entertaining for me to watch.

3)Steins;Gate - The story overall was extremely well executed. Super lovable characters that made you really engaged in their struggle. The story is also very neat and wraps up well.

4) Chunnibyou - Every time I watch this show I fell like the Grinch, my heart grows 3 sizes after a viewing. Very funny and entertaining in addition to giving a pretty profound message in my opinion.

5) Wattamote- It hurts so bad to watch this show, yet it feels soooo good for some reason. This show is executed extremely well and I had some very good laughs watching it.

6) Prisoni School - I honestly didn't expect to enjoy this one as much as I did when I started it. Ecchi shows are normally very meh for me, but this one is different. The complete stupidity of all the situations the cast got in and how seriously they took it made the show for me. Also has Gakuto who I think is a shining example of what men should aspire to be.

7)Jojo's Bizzare Adventure's - This show just works. It also gives me a show to meme about with friends so it's much appreciated

8) Berserk (1996) - Admittedly the show is a bit dated and has some flaws. However, I think it does the best job of adapting the manga so far. It definitely holds a special place in my heart for introducing me to the never ending suffering of being a Berserk fan.

9) FMA: B -Show had me hooked from the very beginning. The amount of development everybody in the show undergoes is extremely solid. Had an extremely satisfying conclusion to me.

10) Nisekoi - Bit of a guilty pleasure here. I often find myself going back to it just to turn my brain off for a second and soak in all the glorious cheesiness of generic harem tropes. On paper this show should be 6/10 but it executes everything so well that it elevates it to a 8-9/10 for me.",best anime
