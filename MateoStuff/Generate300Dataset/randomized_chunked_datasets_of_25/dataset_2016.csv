This 10600K reminds me of the old e8400 in a way, would be more of a true comparison if the cheaper 10400 chip had the high clockspeed capability as this chip is not cheap.  But it's a screamer, really making me think seriously about intel for my summer/fall build (still jamming on my old AMD FX6300).",best midrange CPU

My mother died of lung/brain cancer 3 years ago. She was living in another city with my father and barely had the time to know my first son. She died 1 month and a half after my second son was born and she was already somewhere else in her mind and never knew...

I’d like to go back in time and have more moments with her.

My dad has since moved near me and has tongue/throat/lung cancer. I cherish all the moments with him. I’m going to see him today.

You never know what will happen to your beloved one, so yeah what you said is really important.

Cheers",best gifts for mom
