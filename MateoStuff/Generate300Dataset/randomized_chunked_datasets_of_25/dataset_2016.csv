12321,best gifts for mom,"This was my wife's ""push present"" last year. Taking the stress of a dirty house off a new mother's shoulders was a homerun."
70689,best movies with a cool twist,I think my jaw actually dropped when I saw the twist in Usual Suspects. There are so many clues but I didn’t put it all together until it happened. So well done.
37051,best roller coaster at six flags,"Yeah, the fact that the rides at SFMM are mostly over concrete does bother me- particularly Scream. It really does take away from how solid the ride could be!"
40221,best midrange CPU,"I dunno, people have been saying that for a really long time.  And still, to this day, if you want super high frames your best bet is to get the cheapest intel chip that will scream to 5ghz.  This 10600K reminds me of the old e8400 in a way, would be more of a true comparison if the cheaper 10400 chip had the high clockspeed capability as this chip is not cheap.  But it's a screamer, really making me think seriously about intel for my summer/fall build (still jamming on my old AMD FX6300)."
19007,best YouTube video,"Let's get this out onto a tray!

Nice! M'kay"
47083,best state to visit in the United States,"Another Phoenix resident reporting in. Haven't been arrested or shot yet, either."

65902,best college in california,"Looks these are UC cap GPA. Is there a table that kind of maps unweighted, UC Cap and fully weighted GPA (based on applicant profile)? Based on my early “research” lol from UCLA freshman profile, 4.15 Capped is roughly equal to 4.3 fully weighted and 4.3 Capped is roughly 4.65 fully weighted."
67354,axios alternatives reddit,"Exactly.  At this point, and with so many options, my minimum requirement is that it works in both browser and Node.  

I see there is a 'ky universal' package that does that, but it looks to be a new entrant.

12347,best gifts for mom,"Yes, experiences, time and moments are the most valuable. 

My mother died of lung/brain cancer 3 years ago. She was living in another city with my father and barely had the time to know my first son. She died 1 month and a half after my second son was born and she was already somewhere else in her mind and never knew...

I’d like to go back in time and have more moments with her.

My dad has since moved near me and has tongue/throat/lung cancer. I cherish all the moments with him. I’m going to see him today.

You never know what will happen to your beloved one, so yeah what you said is really important.

Cheers"
