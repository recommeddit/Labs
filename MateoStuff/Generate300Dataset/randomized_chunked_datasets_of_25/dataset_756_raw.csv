"This is a shame. Axios had some nice built-in features that my team really liked out of the box.

Also this is my own personal opinion but I found axios-mock-adapter to be way easier to test with compared to fetch-mock."
Hell yeah dude! Clipping is awesome. I'm not much of a hip hop producer but the ways they utilize Foley is always super creative and inspiring.
"Tobey will always have a special in my heart since spiderman 2002 is my favorite movie of all time.
However after seeing homecoming i have to say, Tom Holland is the perfect spiderman/peter parker."
Also quite a collection on you tube
"Give it time, another couple years."
"I absolutely love Parasite. My favourite film of the past year. I’m not saying I wish The Handmaiden was a success in its place, just that it got a similar level of attention."
"the first one you play is the best one.

sapphire is my favourite, followed closely by diamond"

I loved The One when I first got it but now it has a powdery scent to me. I have to be in the mood to wear it

"> Audio Technica ATH-M50x

This absolutely. Really well made, super sturdy and comfy. Great sound for the price. I utterly love mine. Use them for work (video editing), for commuting, at home hooked up to Hifi. Unless you are going to invest big money in proper audiophile stuff you really can't go wrong with these."
"I'll 2nd New Yorker and New York Mag, both have really upped the ante, along with the Atlantic, in recent years."
"Can't believe no one's mentioned American Optical. Used to make Aviator style glasses for the USAF, now you can find a quality pair of theirs for about $50. Definitely the best bang for the buck pair I've ever bought."
So much money for all of them. Why can’t someone make an electric Miata?
"As an adult, you can learn, however kids are fearless, so as an adult learner, you have to have patience with your playing. Adults have the plus of being more motivated than a kid. However adults have less time to practice.

MFin' pralines and cream.
Something else that really helped with sleeping for me is a bottle that keeps water cold (Mizu or whatever). Being able to drink ice cold water at any time during the night without leaving your bed changes everything.

"Insatiable
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
Weeds (I guess it's more of a dramedy but I think it's hilarious)"
I have seen all of them and loved it. Except maybe watchmen cause I slept (it was the directors cut version and I got lost)
What have France done to be better than Spain?
*Not anymore there’s a blanket!*
This is scarring my brain.
I have a bottle of shalimar I’m looking to give up; it’s just a little too strong for me. Interested?
