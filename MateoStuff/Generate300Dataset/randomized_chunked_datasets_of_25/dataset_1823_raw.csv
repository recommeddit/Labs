"I was using the PX7 as an example (based on the reviews it doesn't seem too bad) let me re-phrase this up then, let's say that I would get a pair of Bluetooth headphones that support aptX LL, would that then beat all of these headsets?"
Samsung announced it at ces
Where do you buys those?  They're delicious!!!
"yeah, but I have a return offer to a large bank which is where 
I would most likely end up if I added accounting, so it doesn't make financial sense for me at the moment"
"I REALLY enjoyed reading ALL of your advices, really appreciate it, i already started to learn python 4 days ago, already have 7 different paid courses from Udemy about Python, i just want to ask you guys, to see if im starting in a good way if i choose Python as a first programming language.

I think i will continue learning Python, and after i will move on to learn JavaScript as my second one.

Sorry for my bad English lol, i’m not a native english speaker.

Edit: if someone needs these paid Udemy courses about Python contact me, FREE ofc"
"This lacks https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=24285 which has the following advantages:

1. Monoprice is a reliable brand
1. Amazon.com co-mingles third party sellers , you never know what you get.
1. You got this advice for free without an affiliate link. I am quite torn whether OP is spam or not but I will let the readers decide: if you think it's spam , report it.

Also, I think every time we discuss cables, this https://www.newnex.com/usb-type-c-products.php needs to be mentioned because while hideously expensive, they certainly fill a market niche."
"which brand, besides apple, might boast the best longevity? I want 16GB and have a decent \~$800-1200 price range, but want to be sure that it's got at least 5 years in it. could you help me out?"
"I use hien in csgo and valorant just fine. I'm 1.00 with 800 dpi in csgo so pretty close to you and I do pretty well. It takes a bit to adjust, but I find the tracking and speed are great with solid stopping power.

I also wish I could get some other colors for those pads!"
"It may be out of pure luck, but I wasn't feeling great yesterday, but I pulled myself out and went to the beach. Put sunsafe protection on and lay on the beach with the hope the vitamin D, fresh air, and general happy vibes of the beach might help. 

I woke up this morning feeling able to goto work. And given I enjoy work, which is a bit odd I know... I felt like my beach trip was a success. 

May be bull, but I feel it helped. 

Also, sitting inside in air con wasn't gonna help"
You’re right. the game doesn’t update as much as I hoped.
"none. im from the future, if you have any graphics cards, save them. even extremely old graphics cards are worth 100$ and theyre expected to be worth more later, and something like an rx 470 is worth 450$, also expected to be worth more. other stuff is also expensive, but especially graphics cards."
This was nice of you to put together.
"I buy my dad replacements for things that he always uses, but that are really outdated and/or malfunctioning. For instance, I bought him some nice new binoculars that you don't have to focus, and his mind was blown."
"Then look at one of the many other options, perhaps?"
I have faith in rivian
How many of these until my drunken stupor is of sufficient quality to defend smoking crack?
"My favourite is pohutukawa, I just like how they look

My least favourite is chestnut trees. 
We had a bunch of American Chestnut trees around our property, and my brothers and I would play tennis with the spike balls. Every time it would devolve into sacking each other with spikes. 
[Here is a picture of the spike balls for context](https://imgur.com/bMf9JFP)"

You should post it on /r/DIY when you're finished!
You can give them to me. I will eat ALL of your Tootsie Rolls.
"Siddharth, interesting choice..... John Abraham is also becoming a surprise mention in multiple lists....."
"And have a fabric sleeve over them. Get to Brazil customs  no plastic wrap, but the sleeves."
"I always say the best gift is something that I want, but wouldn't buy for myself.  So booze isn't necessarily bad.  I like good whiskey, but it's rare that I want to drop $50-70 on a decent bottle of it.  I'd love for someone to do that for me."
"I like them a lot, I was using box whites with 15g clickbars and these feel like a noticeable upgrade"
