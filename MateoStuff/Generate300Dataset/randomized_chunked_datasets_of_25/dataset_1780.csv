23549,"It seems to be somewhat random. Aside from random stuttering the first 30 seconds (alongside audio latency glitching), it ran absolutely fine on my much older rig - GTX 1070/i5 6600k. It might like higher clocks or something, I don't know. But non-dice Frostbite games seem to always have issues with stuttering for a random amount of people playing. I remember playing Jedi Fallen Order very smoothly the first time, but now that I reinstalled it a month ago it's a stuttery mess - I haven't changed any hardware since.

It might be a good try to install any newer game on SSD, devs seem to be caring less and less about HDD streaming on PC",best car racing video game

62705,"Applied Predictive Modeling is my favorite.  So many statistics books are ""Here's a technique, here are a bunch of proofs, here's how to use this technique on a canned problem.""  There's little discussion of why to pick a particular technique over another one, or how to solve a real world problem with messy data.

Applied Predictive Modeling is a book that assumes you know basic statistics and want to predict things.  There's little discussion of coefficients outside of ""After centering and scaling, magnitude could help"", and no canned problems.  It teaches you a bunch of techniques useful for a given type of problem, then goes through a case study on a real, messy dataset, explaining the decision process, how they picked features, and how they picked what models to try out.  It also has R code built on top of the caret package that lets you run all of this (although admittedly, it's REALLY old R code.)

I can't recommend this book enough.",Best Data Science textbook

29580,"I'd say hit and run isn't all that great on PC, the built in controller support is wonky and has issues with newer controllers, along with weird compatibility issues with new version of windows, overall I just found it was easier to emulate.

but good call on battle on bikini bottom, it's actually a very solid platformer/actiony game, and it's faithful to the source material (i was a big fan as a kid, and my younger cousins like it, so i'm still pretty familiar.)

edit: oh god i forgot about the PC version of battle for bikini bottom. but whats the issue with deadpool (besides it not being a very good game)?",best game console

The fact that he also did well at World Cups shouldn't be ignored and I'm not trying to dismiss that. He's a legend of the game, just not in that top tier.",best NFL player
