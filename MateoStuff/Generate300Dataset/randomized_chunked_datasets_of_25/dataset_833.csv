26272,"What kind of liberty does a minority group have when an antagonistic majority takes away their ability to, oh, shop, and buy property, and get jobs?

I think that individual liberty is really easy to understand ""I can do what I want when I want to whomever I want to, and that's freedom.""  It takes out all the other variables and makes for easy comparisons of ""this guy is allowed to do whatever this guy is allowed to do.""

But I feel like it completely ignores context and reality.  At various times the group of philosophers who founded the United States thought that life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness should be guaranteed rights.  When equal access to those things is taken away from groups by groups, I think a worse affront to liberty has been done than making a shop sell equally to everyone.",best politician

Not sure how well it plays on console but since it has crossplay it can't be all bad. The story takes a while to pick up but it's amazing through and through. Even the latest expansion, while the weakest of the bunch, manages to deliver some of the finest rpg storyline in recent memory.

Obvious witcher 3 also. Not once was I bored with the game and when I quit it wasn't out of boredom. After the expansions and 100% achievements unlocked on steam, I just felt like I had my fill. It's amazing to be able to put a game to rest, not due to boredom but due to you just feeling so content and full that you feel like it's time to move on.",Best RPG game on PS4
