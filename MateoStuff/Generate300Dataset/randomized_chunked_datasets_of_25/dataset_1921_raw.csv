I truly have so many more than 5 that are on my ""will reread any time"" favorites list! But if I had to choose, it would be these guys. Not in any real order."
"Also
- U1 chip (for details Find My devices)
- Qualcomm vs intel Modem chipset |edited
- Main camera^(2 vs 1), better Portrait mode and Night vision"
"Depends what you mean with ""similar features"". MS maintains [a list](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/) of editors that support LSP and it has several open source editors on it like kate or atom. (On a completely unrelated note...WTF is [MS paint IDE](https://ms-paint-i.de/). At the moment trying to figure out if satire or meant serious)"
"Detroit isn't as dangerous as some people say, it's got some good bars and restaurants and a pretty great art museum. All kinds of strange flowers germinating in the rubble.

It's a little bit like Greece in that the primary attraction is visting the many lovely ruins. Also, it is bankrupt and negotiating terms with some Germans."
Delightfully devilish Winnie
"Thank you guys for your kind words, helped me start my day off pretty awesome :-)"
"I fully admit that. I've never denied being a shitty person! I tried to kill myself last year. Don't fucking tell me how fucking shitty you think I am because I already fucking know how fucking shitty and worthless I am, ok? Go eat a bag of dicks and rot in hell.

Also, they're just fucking imaginary internet points. Get the fuck over it.

And yes, psychology IS a science."
"Tom, definitely. But I liked Garfield's a lot as well."
"I think that getting an English degree was perfect for me. I told myself in high school that I wanted to get an English degree, become a teacher, and write. I've done the first, start the second next month, and have been writing for some time. Even if I never publish anything worthwhile, I have enough left over at the end of the month to maintain my bicycle and buy the odd bit of camera gear. I live pretty frugally, besides. Plus I get summers and all holidays off... Plenty of time with family... That's something that money will never be able to buy me when they're all dead or when I'm dead. 

I know people that have gotten ""good"" degrees (according to this article anyway) and who are absolutely miserable and have to be locked into that cycle of misery to maintain their lifestyle. They get excited with the paychecks and get 2500/mth apartments and new cars and live for their two weeks vacation. Their argument is that they'll have a good retirement. My argument is that I can go to school again, get a Master's then a Professional cert, keep doing what I'm doing, and my retirement will be just as good as theirs. 

It's a shame that people of my generation (twenties) still get suckered into the notion that it's better to work hard and be happier in old age, when your body is failing on you; if the stress of working or some cancer hasn't killed you yet."

Heh. Her costume was super tiny. I doubt it. Rather chilly evening
"The ability to manage and see your reminders in Fantastical is really handy.
Furthermore it has a great monthly view without missing the Agenda function.

But there are some downsides too. I don't like their maps integration and search and depending on how many appointments you have daily, it might feel a little bit overwhelmed.

It is for sure one of the best calendar clients but like another user mentioned, I would never pay for the desktop version because it is too expensive. After all it is a calendar app.

If you are looking for a great alternative Google calendar is really solid and it is working with iCloud calendars too."
">LTE Discovery to see the bands (they've added 5g recently), network signal guru and QCT Modem Capabilities to force bands.

Still might not be working properly

>I stop forcing any bands and I can see how it automatically switches to B2 and B66 to get to 5g.

B2 and B66 is 4G. If they were 5G they would be n2 and n66 also they both couldn't be 5G at the same time as the only devices that can do carrier aggregation within 5G bands are the new S21 models

Also does the unlocked Pixel 4a 5G have the software update to enable Nationwide 5G yet?"

"Okay, but these things indicate that things are on average better for more people in the higher rated countries."
"Eugene Debs, an incredibly influential figure in the American left and labour history. He ran for president from a prison cell, as his defiant labour activism often had put him in odds with the state. 

Frederick Douglas, arguably the most influential black s statesman, long preceding MILK and other prominent black rights activist. He was a strong early proponent of black, women, and immigrant rights.

As a Canadian, I have to say Tommy Douglas. Socialist politician and hugely influential labour activist who brought forth our national healthcare service."
The Hot Wheels pack for FH3 completely killed off the last bit of my interest in ever going back for GTA racing.
