26919,"Fair enough, I was exaggerating a bit to expand on the point.

But definitely worried about the 10 and 0 people throw around. I haven't played any game deserving of a 0. I actually find it very hard to believe a game commonly know that actually deserves a 0. I mean it would have to be outright broken to the point that it couldn't be played.",best board games

34445,"How is that a bad thing if the patriots get players for cheap and still win? And quit acting like the 80s NFC was miles ahead of the 2000s AFC. The 2000s AFC had Peyton, the great Ravens defense, the great steelers team, and along with the Pats dynasty there was the Chargers who have 2 potentially 3 Hall of Famers all on the same offense. It is indisputable that the salary cap makes it easier to win... otherwise the league would have never started using the salary cap in the first place.",best NFL player

gorgeous beats from one of the main producers on Blonde, strong lyrics/vibes/whatever, kinda reminds me of a certain era of Earl Sweatshirt

[Trelawney Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKrCEBdEiMU&list=PLchHt-c_G2EZfvBJYup8WgwfUgbIeDxtz&index=4) is a good song to get a sense of it from",best hiphop album

The newer shit is really just ""here's a bunch of cars and some generic upgrades you can buy immediately and tweak from day one."" I want that RPG feeling of starting off broke with junker stock cars then move up to higher and higher tiers of upgrades and cash, and even higher end base models.",best car racing video game
14969,"Just for another opinion, I didn't like Crazy for You (to me, the ex-boyfriend was stalker crazy not funny crazy) or Bet Me (I don't like books where the hero only interacts with the heroine because of a bet - though I will concede that Crusie had the heroine find out about the bet pretty early on). My favorite Crusie books (and she used to be an autobuy author for me) are Faking It, Agnes and the Hitman (which she wrote with Bob Mayer) and Maybe this Time. I would still buy her books if she was at all interested in writing romance these days.",best romantic novel
3857,"I can second this.  I have a friend who is a chem major.  Completely slacks off.  She's shown up drunk to class before, gotten drunk DURING class, and refuses to study over extended periods of time.  Since we go to a co-op school, she was preparing to apply that upcoming semester.  She couldn't remember anything of basic gen chem, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry (she had just taken it that past semester!), and physical chemistry...the course she was halfway through THAT semester.  Needless to say, she didn't get a co-op.  She has a mediocre GPA and doesn't remember anything from her classes.  She'll graduate and be able to put down that she received a chemistry degree from a good university, but that doesn't mean she'll actually be of use to companies.",best online college
