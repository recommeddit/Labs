"Don’t go to college unless you know what you want to do. We’ve been looking at this all wrong. 

Start with where you want to be in 10-15 years and then work backwards. What’s between you and that place?

If college is one of those things, then go to college. 

Looking at it the wrong way is how we’ve ended up with $1 trillion in student loan debt. Don’t just go to college for the sake of going to college. It would literally be cheaper to travel around the world. And you’d learn more."

Thanks for all the work you put into this.
"I have to admit, I’ve only read three in this list, currently reading Honey Girl for book club. Two were five stars, one was a two star. 

Interestingly, a few of these authors were self pub before going trad pub."

Bagel or yogurt is my go-to breakfast! Not a big morning eater but it definitely helps tide me over.
"I live in Australia. It's definitely in my best interests to wear sunscreen as much as possible. I'm jealous of your ozone layer... 

Actually, I think I read that Australians have a vitamin D deficiency quite  a lot of the time. But I guess that's better than the alternative around here for sure"
I’m still glad I said no.
"I don't think that this has existed outside of the Chinese market.

If you have access to the Chinese market, the closest I can think of are the Redmibook 16, the Magicbook pro 2020, and Mechervo's Code01."
Not gonna lie I have the plan where I can trade in the previous years iPhone and pay tax and get the new one and honestly I like it. Every time I get a new phone it feels like it is the new best for me like it just gets better every time...
"lol. I’ve learned that if some one asks me if I want something weird, to say no. I’ve been asked if I wanted fire, smack, loud, some good stuff. I eventually worked out what all of them were except fire, so if someone could explain that one, I would appreciate it."

"I use the limefuel 15600mAh. I bought mine for $40. 
It charges my iPhone 5 at least 5-6 times from dead. It's a little big so maybe you can get a smaller battery size for a little cheaper.

Finished watching this last night and I found it to be great as well. Very informative!
"Nothing too specific. I would prefer to at least have 500 gigs of space or at least have the option to upgrade drive space. Not too picky, whatever has the best performance and reliability for the price."
"A good set of cookware.   Whether its pots and pans, or a good chef's knife,  every investment I make in my kitchen increases my quality of life.  

Edit: I feel like a few people are being deliberately negative about this. For those of you who honestly dont think that you can buy good cookware for under $100 dollars I encourage you to temper your expectations of what ""good"" is and check out amazon right now. If you want a full blown set of decent pots and pans there is a ceramic set for around $85 dollars right now. Ceramic cookware is what I started learning to cook on.  Its not perfect but it's a lot better than any teflon or imitation teflon crap out there. If you prefer iron like I do, lodge is a great company and they have a 10 inch iron skillet on sale for $15 dollars right now. Pair that with a decent chef's knife from Mercer $45 (the brand I am currently using) then throw in a dutch oven (looks like you can get one from lodge for 40 dollars and it has a decent rating.) And you're good to go. Those three tools will last for life if taken care of and you can make so much with them. A shepherd's pie, pizza, fresh bread, soups and stews, stir fry..... I mean almost anything.  Pro tip, even if it says preseasoned, look up how to season it anyway. And never use soap on your iron.  Scrub it in the sink under hot water, heat it up on the stove to get the moisture off fast, when it cools off rub it down with any old cooking oils. Just a thin layer with a paper towel will do."

"Being from Germany and currently living in the far, far North of the USA (you have no idea how much I hate it here),  I might actually include Norway and Sweden in my list of countries to consider for immigration."
"Here's the thing:

The `fetch` API was intended as a promise-based replacement for the clunky `XMLHttpRequest` in browsers. It makes it easy to do simple requests without an external library, but it wasn't intended to be full of convenience features or remove all conceivable need for such libraries. In the [spec repo](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch), often when somebody complains in the issues about something that they think isn't very ergonomic, the official advice is ""just write/use a wrapper"".

Axios is one of those aforementioned convenience libraries. In the browser it *could* wrap `fetch`, however for now it continues to use `XMLHttpRequest` under the hood because:

1. Compatibility

2. Fetch is still missing one or two features that XHR has, like upload progress monitoring

So my point is that, even if there is some use-case overlap, in the browser fetch and Axios kinda serve different purposes - one's a medium-level native API, the other is a higher-level external convenience wrapper.

With Node the story is a little different: both Axios *and* `node-fetch` wrap Node's built-in low-level API. So why does `node-fetch` exist then? Why would developers use a less convenient/feature-rich API if it requires an external package anyway? For two reasons:

1. They already use fetch on the frontend (because it's built-in/standardized and good enough for their use case) and want to reduce cognitive overhead by using the same API on the backend.

   and/or...

2. They are running the same code on the frontend and backend (e.g. React server rendering), so they need a (more-or-less) cross-compatible API (running via `isomorphic-fetch` or similar). Axios can serve this purpose too, but it's still extra dependency code on the frontend.

So yeah my overall point is that directly comparing the two kinda misses these nuances. Even more so in an article like this one where point number 6 talks about browser compatibility... for `node-fetch`..."
