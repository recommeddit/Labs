53391,"The Type-C port on my 20,000 PD Anker power bank stopped working. They won't do warranty service on it, which makes sense as its a bit past the warranty period, but they won't do a paid repair either. The device isn't two years old yet. I really wish I could get it repaired, even out of pocket.

I had a 20,100 power bank of theirs that was Type-C without PD. I had to get that one replaced over they Type-C port too. I used to like Anker a lot, but their Type-C ports seem like a weak point. I'm giving RavPower a try now instead of Anker.",best usb c charging cable
