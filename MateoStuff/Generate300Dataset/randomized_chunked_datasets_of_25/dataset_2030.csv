22453,"I worked as a waiter at a popular restaurant near San Francisco for a few years. It used to be a super popular spot back in the 60's/70's as it offered the celebrities of that time a place to dine just outside of the city without the crowds of fans. A lot of them would still visit on occassion during my employment there (2009-12). 

My favorite individual encounters are waiting on Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, and serving apps to Robin Williams and his wife. They were all really nice given the setting. I didn't really exchange any conversation besides telling Robert Plant that I was a fan when dropping the check, and him thanking me. I can't remember exactly what they ordered to eat, but I know he had a virgin Bloody Mary to drink. 

Every time someone famous came in was exciting to me but my more tenured co workers were pretty used to the sightings. I remember noticing the height difference between Williams and his wife, as well as her looking very beautiful. Of course, seeing his legendary smile irl that I had grown up watching my entire life will be a permanent memory of mine.

Carlos Santana came in once and was seated in my section, but I gave the table to another server higher up on the food chain who had waited on Carlos more than once in the past. He was wearing white pants, a white jacket, and a nice looking fancy white hat. He had a bowl of Bouillabaisse (iirc) and was also one of the first customers to walk in that day. Most first comers during the summer snag tables on the patio that look out across the bay, but he wanted to sit inside next to a window. After his meal, he went through the kitchen and took a few group pictures with all of the cooks and bussers. Seemed really friendly.

Bonus bogus ""celebrity"" experience having to wait on a C list actor that was in the 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" film. He made SURE I knew that he was in an upcoming Disney remake featuring Johnny Depp. This was before I had seen any sort of advertising for the movie, and I still haven't actually watched it so I'm not sure if he even made the cut. He got wasted drunk and was an arrogant ass. Think he told me that he was the hot air balloon pilot? Or something? Guy sucked. First time I ever served St. Germain.

Also, I waited in line for Space Mountain at Disneyland with Sean Penn and his also famous wife at the time and their kids. I noticed it was him while he and his son were standing in a semi roped off area just outside of the actual line where the rest of their family stood. An employee eventually came over and reminded him that they couldn't wait there and they hopped back in line one or two parties ahead of me. When the line turned into a switch back style and he was facing me I flashed the measliest peace sign a pimply faced star struck teenager could, and he nodded in turn. The fact that he and his family were actually waiting in a 40 min line for a ride, and the way he responded when asked to get back in line, made him seem more human to me.",best celebrity

51292,"I had a case from Nudient last year thatâ€™s a hard shell case. It was so well refined the speaker grills had individual holes. Thereâ€™s a MagSafe ring built into the case and itâ€™s saved my phone from a few drops. (Peel ripped them off, theyâ€™ve had cases for years, peel just dropped their 12 pro series this year and completely copied their design) 


Iâ€™m checking out the moment cases this year, I ordered the regular one and the leather one. I wanted one for my 12 pro max but they didnâ€™t have MagSafe compatible versions ready.

* LG 27GL850B

68290,"The sequels are written by a different person. They also have a different focus. The second book is more fantasy than science fiction. It also changes the focus, instead of PVE it's PVP. 

I only read the second and some pages of the third before abandoning them. I hated several things about the book, like how people were more professional on the first book than the second, and (mild spoiler) >!a biologist more worried about dying of hunger than thirst when trapped somewhere!<.

30206,"We learned that Mexico had invited Americans in to settle because they could withstand attacks by the American Indian tribes.

Eventually Mexico decides to enforce its laws. Texans donâ€™t like it. They declare independence. The US waits a few years to annex Texas. The pretext was that Mexican soldiers allegedly fired at Americans on American soilâ€”lots of alleging there. In the end the US took a lot more land than Mexico.",best Mexican war to study
