"Wo! Bbq ice cream? And I thought steak chips were strange. At least your tried it. 

I can get behind coffee and vanilla beans. I really like these two too. 

To make chocolate chip cookie dough, the dough has to be pasteurized?"
"Holy shit thereâ€™s like three different artists with similar names

Maasaai

Maassai

Massai"
"Oh, Lord.. Reekris!"
I have the same question.
"And Arizona probably won't arrest or shoot you.  It is mostly a myth.

"I resisted reading Watership Down for years. Afterall, I'm a grown man, why the hell would I read a book about rabbits? 

I was so wrong. What a fantastic read."
"if he's going way low budget I love my MDR-V300's. It's an older model, but they fit well on me and the sound quality is good enough for my needs."
"I don't think walking in a straight line is a thing in the east or west coasts. My local Search & Rescue (west coast) is always looking for lost or dead people. I'm sure the east coast has the same problem because all it takes is tree cover and someone without a compass. I volunteer with SAR in a county of 50,000 people and we've located 5 bodies this summer alone. 2 in rivers. 3 in forests where they just walk in circles."
"""Hummer"" brand scent

Honestly, I thought it was a joke at first, but that shit smells fantastic."
You can do screen mirroring on the new ones.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm carbs and only carbs...
"In my experience (full disclosure, i'm american), scones are generally sweet?  Am I mistaken about this?

American biscuits are normally savory.   It's basically a type of roll but a little different with a sausage gravy poured on top.  It really is pretty good, as long as you don't mind having your ENTIRE MEAL taste exactly the same, bite for bite."
they should also stop testing with medium settings just to create cpu bottleneck at 200+ fps. And i get it they want to create that bottleneck otherwise they have nothing to show but at some point your just creating artificial bottlenecks for the sake of it with no real world application
"No, I just like Ruby better. That's just my opinion though"
"Cookie Dough, every other answer is wrong"
Really? I'm curious how you found this out...can you share your source?
"WaPo is good for staying connected politics wise, but then again they sporadically release incredibly biased pieces.  Politico is the same way, except they seem to go either way sometimes, whereas Wapo is consistently left.

As other people are saying, multiple sources is by far the best.  There are better options, but I generally will read wapo, politico, the times or Reuters, for a more balanced perspective, and then if theres an interesting or controversial story I'll try to find something about it on something egregious like Slate or Breitbart."
Yeah I'm looking but I can't really find anything interesting
"I don't like any of them. I know that's a little harsh but I don't think any of them really nailed it. Stated differently, I do not recognize the Peter Parker I know and love from the comics when I watch these guys on screen.

But of the three, I definitely enjoyed Tobey's movies the most. I don't really attribute that to him, though. Sam Raimi is the man."
Harmonica
"They should have used different (not that much, but still noticeable) genres with every character.  


Instead, they Guardians of the Galaxyfied even Thor Ragnarok (that I love, mind you...but still...)"
"1. I use Windscribe, researched it and it is solid. 

2. You can use the search bars on this or the r/piracy sub to search those VPNs for more info any time.

3. You also can research them on torrentfreak.com  They both have outstanding records in court for not keeping user info. If they don't keep records, there's nothing to give law enforcement if they come knocking."
$150 for entry level Z490 (which some people on the Intel subreddit argued those boards are inadequate for any serious 10600K OCing) vs a $80 Asrock B450m Pro4 that can run a stock 3900X/3950X or an OC'ed 3900X with extra airflow over VRMs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9_E3h8bLp-TXr-0zTJFqqVxdCR9daIVNyMatydkpFA/edit#gid=611478281
