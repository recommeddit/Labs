33853,best Pokemon game,"People generally categorize the Pokemon games into their favorites. Here’s what I think are the best games per region, and you can choose from there:

Kanto: The Gen 1 remakes (FireRed and LeafGreen) are very friendly to newer players, with an on-demand help menu and the Teachy TV as an accessible tutorial. It could be a little weird to go back, since these are the only games on the list before the physical-special split, but I recommend it for the best Kanto experience.

Johto: Definitely go with HeartGold and SoulSilver for this one. The remakes add so much more functionality (an automatic run button on the bottom screen!) and refine Johto’s wonky late-game. There’s also the most stuff to do after you beat the game. If you’re dead set on transferring everything up to Moon, it might be easier to buy the virtual console of Crystal, since it works with the Poke Transporter out of the box and gives everything you transfer up its Hidden Ability, including legendaries like Ho-Oh, Celebi, and Suicune.

Hoenn: My personal favorite Pokemon game is Emerald. I love all the Pokemon in this region, a lot of the routes, and the music is very good. The remakes (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire) have a better selection of Pokemon, remasters of all the music for better or worse, and some of the best features like sneaking, analog movement, and the DexNav. Both of them are good.

Sinnoh: Platinum is your best pick outta these three. Most people’s complaint about Gen 4 (aside from not having many fire types besides Chimchar) is that battles take a while. Platinum’s refinements makes the game faster overall. Oh, yeah, and the better selection that comes with every remake. It’s worth noting that this generation introduced the physical-special split, which you’d only have to worry about otherwise if you play through any of the Virtual Console games or the Kanto remakes.

Unova: Well, Unova is a doozy. Black and White 2 are direct sequels to Black and White (Johto is the same type of deal with Kanto, but the stories of B2W2 require knowledge of the games before them). I think that with the increased selection and increased amount of things to do, the sequels stand better than the prequels as games, but both may be to your liking. The prequels made big improvements to the system as well, such as TMs becoming unlimited-use and Hidden Abilities. If you like story, play through Black or White, and if you liked that get the sequel to the color you chose. Oh, and also: if you want to move up your Pokemon from Sinnoh or the Johto remakes, you’ll need to beat a Unova game and go to the Poké Transfer Lab to do that. Once in generation 5, you can use the Pokemon Bank to zip zop zoobity boop ‘em into there.

Kalos: Well, there isn’t really much of an option here. I’d say X and Y have a comparable amount of story, and that the focus is on the gameplay more than anything else. To me, the story makes more sense if you get Y, for reasons that become clear at its climax. This generation has some of the best quality-of-life features, like the PSS (which is also in the Hoenn remakes) and a GTS that still works. And moving your Pokemon from XY to Sun and Moon is as simple as depositing them in from one and dropping them into the other! 

Alola: You already know this one. I would recommend playing through Sun or Moon for its story, and then playing through Ultra Sun and Moon for its gameplay improvements. The standard increased selection and “more to do” applies to USUM, and to me it feels like a more complete game."
61865,Best RPG game on PS4,"I dont think people consider only turn based games RPG's, its more that they think of going to towns with interactable NPC's, a heavy plot driven story, etc. etc. Its like how Tales Of games are definitely considered RPGs even though they arent turn based games.

I consider bloodborne an action-rpg for sure though. its definitively an action game, but the skill progression/leveling, equipement system, etc. are certainly RPG elements."

I also have very fond memories of sitting under that tree and just doing random kid shit.

She also had a pussy willow which I thought was really neat since it was all fully and she had some old folk story that went along with that tree but I have long since forgotten what it was."

5942,best programming language for web development,"Certain languages make expressing ideas a certain way easier, where as others are more flexible or dictate more boiler plating and putting mental energy to conceptualizing those. Also depth of understanding in the language is an issue. Language features are a real part of the development process."
