7714,best laptop for general use,"Looking for a laptop to replace a 2012 MacBook Pro. Budget is up to ~$1100 USD. Use will be video streaming, spreadsheets, internet browsing, workout videos, paying bills etc. Portability and battery life aren‚Äôt extremely important. It‚Äôll spend most of its life plugged in on a desk. 

I‚Äôm not stuck on a Mac again though we are and iPhone family so the integration is a draw. I‚Äôve also been very satisfied with the life of our current MacBook, don‚Äôt recall having a PC that‚Äôs lasted 8 years before. 

Am I better off with a more bang for your buck windows laptop or should I just go for one of the new M1 MacBook airs?"

25504,best cricket teams of all time,"Kohli has the worst batting line up (himself excluded) of the last 4 Indian captains for his bowlers to be even more effective and enhance his already good record. 

Past Indian captains were a fast bowler short of what he has now (combination wise) but Kohli has 4 or 5 batsmen short of what they had at their disposal in terms of quality.

He is shat upon as worst captain in social media era ignorant generation, but record speaks that he is closer to these other legends even with this shit batting line up around him."
