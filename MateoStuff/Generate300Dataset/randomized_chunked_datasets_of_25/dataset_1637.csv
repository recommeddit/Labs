 good, the other rides are pretty blah though"

49346,best gaming monitor,"From the research I did both the LG27GL850-B and Dell S2721DGF are very good, each edging other out in various categories. I ended up ordering the Dell, but if you find a good price on the LG then you are not making a mistake either.

28839,best breakfast foods,"I'd say just use high end ingredients. Whole fat milk from pasture raised cows, high end free range eggs, olive oil, all blended together in a food processor. That's really all I do. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful."
56673,best desktop monitor,TN panels are far superior for gaming due to the very quick response time. It's still isn't fast enough for color to color and causes some ghosting even at high refresh rate.

26175,best politician,"Fun little anecdote about Bryd, from when I was interning in Congress about 8 years ago.

He was very old at the time and had fairly poor eyesight. He still liked to go out to the floor in his wheelchair though and give speeches, so he would get an aid to print out his speeches on paper with massive font, we are talking about around 2 sentences a page. He would then proceed to sit with a giant stack of paper and go through his speech.

He also had a special wheel-chair accessible phone booth installed for him in the Democratic whip room.

He was an incredibly respected guy."

60220,best freezer brand,"Honestly I would try to find an older one online. I'm a refrigeration/hvac tech and I have worked on a few very high end fridges. They aren't made like they used to, same with hvac equipment. Sub zero fridges which are around 8000 bucks aren't built any stronger then a cheap one as far as the mechanics. Same compressor same evap/condenser. The old deep freezers were built alot thicker/stronger."
