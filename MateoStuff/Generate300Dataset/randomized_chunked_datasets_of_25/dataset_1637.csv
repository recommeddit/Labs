He was very old at the time and had fairly poor eyesight. He still liked to go out to the floor in his wheelchair though and give speeches, so he would get an aid to print out his speeches on paper with massive font, we are talking about around 2 sentences a page. He would then proceed to sit with a giant stack of paper and go through his speech.

He also had a special wheel-chair accessible phone booth installed for him in the Democratic whip room.

He was an incredibly respected guy.",best politician
