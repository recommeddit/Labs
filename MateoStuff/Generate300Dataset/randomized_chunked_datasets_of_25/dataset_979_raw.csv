I've got a boner rn
No morals.
Target has some good backpacks
Sigh. I feel like I hear more about EVs these days than regular cars.
i saw it coming from a mile away. imo it falls under the category good but predictable
"Head over to /r/headphones and check out the 'start here' tab, and search through the previous posts. Check out the buying guide and read up on the different sort of headphone constructions and what their pros/cons are. That sub is SUPER helpful and helped me choose my headphones.

Headphones are quite a personal thing, and you'll need to take into account where you plan on using them the most, what you listen to (as you said mostly rock, jazz etc) and things like that."
"Not OP, but that was one of my favorite books for a very long time. That whole deconstruction of humanity by a human raised by non-humans, his discovery of laughter, so damn powerful.

After my 5th or 6th time reading it, a lot of the flaws started peaking through. It's more than a little sexist, which is a big problem in sci-fi, and the final act was a bit...*culty*."
"AC Odyssey, Skyrim VR, FFVII"
SHEELA!!
"GREAT movie. One of my favorites. Ending is a bit of a head trip, but I don't personally feel like it was a mind fuck."
"Pro mar 200 low sheen is Definitely the best paint:price ratio and it’s our go to for new construction.  

But for high end repaints/new construction Ben Moore regal is our choice. 

BM Aura is good but I prefer the regal all day!"
"I really liked MJ in Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, but Spider-Man 3 didn't do her a favor. While I - unlike most others - really, really love Spider-Man, especially exploring Peter's ""dark side"" and the conclusion of the Harry-arc, all the scenes and drama involving MJ was not great to watch. She acted like a bitch in this one. But especially in  Spider-Man 2 her relationship with Peter was great. And the Peter-MJ-Spidey-love triangle always gibes me some great Richard-Donner-Superman-vibes."
"They classify Cal States as ""regional"" universities as opposed to ""national.""

It's the #4 university in the category ""Regional West""

"I almost said ""hey! That's stolen from Ne-oh never mind"""
Put a few grenades and some explosives next time. That should do the trick.
I was about to say this. But I just wish the bottle would come with a cap or something so it doesn't release on accident when packed in a luggage.
The last big update just made everything 100x better on mobile. Moving money between categories was a pain before then. It's so clean now.
"I have Ms Word flag the things that I want it too and that's it. All grammar checkers have blindspots and for me to get everything I want. I'll probably have to use two more grammar checkers and I hate using multiple programs when I should only need one. Also, there isn't a grammar checker that will catch this mistake. ""Joe had a god"" when it's supposed to be ""Joe had a dog."" 

That's a type of a spelling mistake I frequently make. The, ""I spelled a noun wrong into a word that happens to be a noun as well"" error. Grammar checkers know nothing about context. The only way that sort of error is caught is through text-to-speech. I rate TTS programs higher than a grammar checker at this point."
"local papers, imo."
I doubt they’ll be constrained that much. This is Ford. A year is plenty of time to mitigate those supply shortages.

Also Jomashop. I think most of them are ~80ish
"The real reason hand sanitizer says 99.X% percent is they can't make the claim of 100% and be safe from legal liability, even though 100% is largely accurate. Even bleach cleaner can't make the 100% claim for that reason, even though bleach *definitely* kills 100% of things."
been using EveryDollar since it came out. love it
