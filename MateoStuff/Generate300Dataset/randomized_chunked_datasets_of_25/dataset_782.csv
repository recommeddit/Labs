27223,They got screwed over buying the old Zellers. It was such a good deal when the stores wee being liquidated but their logistics software didn't work properly. They would sell something but the warehouse would never find out. They were saddled with too much overhead because they moved into so many stores at once because of the Zellers deal and it slowly crushed them.. its a pretty interesting story actually. To bad though,best stocks to buy
65978,"You realize if you're within the top 9% of high school students in CA, you're guaranteed a spot at a UC. It may not be the UC of your choice, but it is a guarantee. Between that and the Cal Grant, I was able to go from the first HS grad in my family to an MD.

62152,"Honestly, FFXV is pretty unique as a FF game.  Finally, it feels quite different from all their other games (in a good way).  The game has some flaws but don’t let that get in the way of it.

Also, Final Fantasy 14 just greatly expanded their free trial to include the whole base game + the first expansion Heavensward.  This is SOO MUCH content for free.  I started up and am in the in-between period the end of the base game and Heavensward (and there’s a ridiculous amount of content at this part alone).  It’s quite the experience and it is SUPER single player friendly.  They do a good job easing you into the experience and the multiplayer aspects.  It’s been a lot of fun so far (and only getting better and more in-depth).",Best RPG game on PS4

I'm just as proud of my heritage as the next Texan, but like, *how did Mexico not just steamroll the Texians?* Mexico had us out-manned and out-gunned, Mexico had professional soldiers and we had rebellious farmers, led by frontiersmen, directed by a general who no one wanted to listen to.
