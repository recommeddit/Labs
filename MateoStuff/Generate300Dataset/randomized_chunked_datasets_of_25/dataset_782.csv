27223,best stocks to buy,They got screwed over buying the old Zellers. It was such a good deal when the stores wee being liquidated but their logistics software didn't work properly. They would sell something but the warehouse would never find out. They were saddled with too much overhead because they moved into so many stores at once because of the Zellers deal and it slowly crushed them.. its a pretty interesting story actually. To bad though
65978,best college in california,"You realize if you're within the top 9% of high school students in CA, you're guaranteed a spot at a UC. It may not be the UC of your choice, but it is a guarantee. Between that and the Cal Grant, I was able to go from the first HS grad in my family to an MD.

64058,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"Thanks for the info. 

I managed to grab about 8-10 audiobooks but had to get some elsewhere as this site didn't seem to have everything I was looking for.  
Weirdly they had some books from a certain series but not all."

62152,Best RPG game on PS4,"Honestly, FFXV is pretty unique as a FF game.  Finally, it feels quite different from all their other games (in a good way).  The game has some flaws but don’t let that get in the way of it.

Also, Final Fantasy 14 just greatly expanded their free trial to include the whole base game + the first expansion Heavensward.  This is SOO MUCH content for free.  I started up and am in the in-between period the end of the base game and Heavensward (and there’s a ridiculous amount of content at this part alone).  It’s quite the experience and it is SUPER single player friendly.  They do a good job easing you into the experience and the multiplayer aspects.  It’s been a lot of fun so far (and only getting better and more in-depth)."

Apathetic or Rude staff.
Asphalt paths cracking or full of potholes.
Trash on the hillsides over fences and retaining walls (really bad by X2).
Advertisements plastered all over the place.
Low effort or a lack of landscaping.
Very disappointing merchandise offerings.

And specific to Magic Mountain, very small ride selection outside of the coasters."

30156,best Mexican war to study,"That's the one thing that really baffles me about the Texas Revolution. I'm just as proud of my heritage as the next Texan, but like, *how did Mexico not just steamroll the Texians?* Mexico had us out-manned and out-gunned, Mexico had professional soldiers and we had rebellious farmers, led by frontiersmen, directed by a general who no one wanted to listen to. This *should* have been a cakewalk for Mexico"

And Pac changed the whole approach niggas was taking to Hip Hop with Me Against The World. Im talking this shit in POV of big companies btw. I dont give 2 shits bout a solo niggas top albums, cuz everyone feel different musics. Its not that deep when it comes to single people. But big companies can suck my dick if they aint have nothing better to do with they mouth if they gone disrespect Hip Hop like that."
