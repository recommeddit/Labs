"When I see ""Miata"" I imagine the car looking something like Fiat Punto."
"So I got this idea from a blog, and it actually works better for a birthday, but you could use it for any special occasion.  For my dad's 60th we did this thing called ""60 Years of Memories.""  Basically, we documented 60 separate memories from his life, typed them all up, pasted them on card stock, and put each one in an envelope, labeled 1-60.  Everyone in the immediate family (mom, sister, brother, me) wrote a few each, and then we got the rest from my dad's family and friends.  We also used some pictures from his childhood, so he could tell us the memory.  We then all sat around with my dad as we read through them all.  It was an amazing experience--probably one of the best nights I can remember as a family.  He really loved it, and so did we--it let us all say things we had always wanted to say, but never had a reason to.  You could do something like this--""X Years of Father's Days"", one memory for every year you've been born?

EDIT:  I'm not a father, but I have one."

He did a good job with it. Hopefully the picture for his card is nice too. Tried to find a good one after that hail mary
"Too old to get updates? It is still up to today’s standards. It’ll still have a lot of updates for the next years.
I’ve had mine almost since it came out and I still have friends who buy it today. It is a very nice phone. Although, if you have the cash, go for an 11, not much more and has some more benefits."
"Guitar is my main instrument, and I disagree. Piano can have single lines, full chords, multiple independent voice textures. Complicated counterpoint is not always possible on guitar. Neither are open chord voicing. A piano's range is almost double a normal guitar.

There's a reason music theory is always taught in a room with a piano in it."
I enjoy SU&SD and respect their opinion but remember a lot of the enjoyment of games and similar stuff is subjective. Even if a game has a 1 out of 5 star review or a movie has a terrible RT rating there is no reason you may not love it. Games and other entertainment really is about experiencing it rather than hearing about other's people experience of it. We are so lucky to have SU&SD and Dice Tower etc. but sometimes I worry we spend too much time watching reviews and not enough time playng games lol
"Some other books I can recommend myself, besides the ones mentioned below:

* Willpower by John Tierney
* Drive by Daniel Pink
* Making Habits, Breaking Habits: Why We Do Things, Why We Don't, and How to Make Any Change Stick by Jeremy Dean
* Making Good Habits, Breaking Bad Habits: 14 New Behaviors That Will Energize Your Life by Joyce Meyer
* Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results by Stephen Guise"
Yeah Midnight x Graphite is the way to go. So slick
"Hmm, good to know. Yeah the catch is its a gift card for Menards but they have so many other home items is not just lumber and kitchen sinks. If they had a real grocery section, we'd shop there exclusively, probably. Thanks for the heads up though."
I just bought another pair of [Kent Wang](http://www.kentwang.com/misc/sunglasses/sunglasses-keyhole.html) sunglasses in Tortoiseshell. I owned a pair of them last summer and they were my most favorite pair of sunglasses but unfortunately I lost them in a river.

"Session 9

It's about a team of hazmat workers cleaning up asbestos from an abandoned mental hospital filled with relics and paperwork and.... recordings. It's not a mindfuck as much as a psychic infection."
"Gotta love the viper.

I prefer his COD plays though.

"It is very mixed to be honest. The urban areas are indeed very progressive, especially the youth (I‘m a student in Bern). I‘m not sure about the workplace equality, as all I did was small jobs and I‘m male, so I would not really be on the recieving end of inequality.
As probably in most developed countries it really depends on where you go and with what ageclass of people you interact. The old generations and the rural population are still very religious, conservative and to the extend I experienced it somewhat racist, but the youth is the complete opposite (and with youth I mean up to 30-35 even).
Im not at all patriotic or somehow proud of „my“ country, but overall it‘s the best imaginable place to live in. Especially for the outdoors (woods and mountains) and for traveling. Drive 3-5 hours in one direction and you are already in the next country."

"Roadside Picnic has easily the most unique, and dare I say best, takes on human interaction with an alien species."
"Wife and I used to have a noisy neighbour, and then all of a sudden the loud music and noise in the evenings stopped.  A few days later every time we went in the hall we joked that it ""smelled like death in here"".

A few days after that we come home and find our landlord hauling stuff out and asked him what happened.

""He died."""
2016* anyway i agree
"It depends on what you want to do with your hotel points. After just under two years with Marriott, I have 3/4 points to get a Harley - Davidson. That's without a Marriott rewards credit card."
My favorite has always been monster ultra sunrise. It tastes like orange juice that hates you.
The borgore remix is rowdy as fuuuck too
"Give her some time - that's all I ever wanted when I was home with kids - time. During that time, however long it is (a couple hours at least) let her go off and do whatever she wants, see a movie, meet friends for lunch, shop, hike/bike/ski etc. - you stay home with the baby (or if what she wants is some time with you, you arrange babysitting) make sure to take care of any house chores your wife would normally do during this time. Don't let her come home to a pile of unfolded laundry and a full dishwasher."
I found the comment and gave the upvote. I'm doing my part!
