25859,best cricket teams of all time,26 out of India's 29 test losses were away. It is definitely the reason why they haven't been able to dominate test cricket like teams of the past were able to.
32086,best hotel to live in,"The tourist should adapt to the culture, not the other way around."
6097,best Netflix documentary,"I enjoyed Icarus and that Hulk Hogan one. Both are mainstream. Apart from that, I kinda liked the Joan Didion documentary. I've read one of her books like 15 years ago and it was a pretty good doc."
30865,best country to live in,You should be happy now that the Russians and Germans aren't invading anymore.
24918,best spiderman actor,"Tobey Maguire played a good Peter Parker. As an awkward socially inept nerd.  But as Spiderman he remained awkward and wooden. His quips came across as rehearsed (which they were of course) and stale. Compare this to Robert Downey Jr. whose (also rehearsed) quips seem spontaneous and give the sense that Tony Stark is quick witted. 

Andrew Garfield played Spiderman much better.  You feel his angst and his heart break over uncle Ben. Hee also had great chemistry with Emma Stone. As Spiderman he came across as witty and charismatic. But as Peter Parker he was too cool. He was more of a misunderstood loner than a nerd. Andrew Garfield is naturally charismatic anyways and would probably struggle to come across any other way, But the script here didn't ask him to. I actually thought ASM was good. ASM2 was a mess through no fault of Garfield. 

Tom Holland pulls off both aspects of Peter Parker/Spiderman. As Peter Parker he pulls off the classic socially inept genius on the outside of social circles looking in. He is overeager and a little girl crazy, much like classic comic book Parker. As Spiderman he's a hard luck hero who won't stay down, talks a mile a minute, ahs uses his brain as much as his brawn. I love the Queens accent he uses to disguise his voice. 

Andrew Garfield is the best actor to play Spiderman. Tom Holland plays the best Spiderman. Tobey Maguire was just ok but it was the first time we saw Spiderman on the big screen so we geeked out about it anyways."
16757,best pet for toddlers,Love that description! Makes me nostalgic for my childhood.  Do they even make tonka trucks anymore?
49027,best gaming monitor,"I just got 2 27GL850s, and have to say they are pretty awesome!

I also considered the VG27AQ and the 27GL83A-B. From what I read, the 27GL83A-B is nearly identical to the 27GL850, but lacks a few features and is over 100 dollars cheaper. I would have probably gone with the 27GL83A-B, but they were out of stock at the time.

I know monitors are in short supply right now, so keep that in mind as well."

58399,best cologne,Agreed. Disregard Acqua Di Gio.
73901,best matte screen protector for ipad,Another one for PaperLike. I’m not in love with it being matte but it’s amazing with the pencil. And you don’t mind it in the long run without the pencil.
