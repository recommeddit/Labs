47410,"Yes! My family visited Phoenix in August and we decided to go hiking midday. The people working at our hotel basically begged us not to go out. We brought a ridiculous amount of Gatorade and water, and finished it all in record time. But the view from where we hiked was breathtaking.

As a snake lover, I was sorely disappointed I didn't see any rattlesnakes. Our desert guide told me to come back in the cooler months if I expected to see any!",best state to visit in the United States

By the end of the first semester, he was playing the first Chopin Nocturne amazingly well. Everyone was floored by his progress.

17824,"1. Khloe is funny, consistently entertaining, and genuinely cares about her family. She also seems to have more real confidence in who she is, like she has an actual personality that she‚Äôs not afraid to show. She can do much better than Tristan and I hope she will.
2. Kourtney seems down-to-earth and like she has a good head on her shoulders, even if that makes her annoying sometimes. If I could be friends with any of them, it would probably her her. 
3. Kris gives me mixed feelings because I feel like she exploited the Jenner kids before they could really consent, but also, they are rich because of her, so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4. Scott, like Khloe, is always good TV and I feel for his issues. I am really glad he seems to have pulled himself out of the alcoholism for a bit.
5. Kylie has no personality but, as with Kendall, I feel like I‚Äôd be equally anxious and guarded if raised on TV
6. Kendall for the same reason as above. Loses points for faux-wokeness.
7. I waver on Kim, but right now she‚Äôs not on my good list. Needs to find herself. 
8. Caitlin was a good dad, but I think her lifelong struggle with her identity caused some mental health issues that have resulted in a toxic person.
9. Kanye, as I‚Äôve mentioned somewhere else, I think is not doing Kim any favors. Apologies to fans here but I think his lyrics about his daughters were creepy af, he treats Kim like a Barbie doll for him to play with, whines about the tortures of monogamy, and I‚Äôm over it.

And I agree completely. Figuring out what it is you want to commit your life too, that is where the real power is, but so far I haven't found a good way to articulate how one can discover their Life's Purpose. But I'm working on it. 

The Artist's Way and The ONE Thing are books that have helped me, but personally, nothing has been more powerful than a responsibly conducted psychedelic experience.",best books for building better habits reddit
