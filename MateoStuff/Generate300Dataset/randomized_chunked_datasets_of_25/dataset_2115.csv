She didn't realize he was there in the middle or about to do something with the Make A Wish Foundation so she waited until they were done around 20-30 min later and then a bunch of the kids and people wanted photos with him - he made it a point to stick around and told his staff ""I think that woman wanted a photo"" and made sure she got it. Mom was thrilled. He was such a humble nice dude.",best celebrity

57590,"I can't speak for all 16 of the Replica scents because I don't remember all of them off the top of my head and didn't even see the Replica Fantasies when I was in the store but for the three that I mentioned, Jazz Club, Barber Shop, and Music Festival, here's my impressions.   


Jazz Club is the darker, and strongest of the three. It's suited for date nights, dinner outings, and other evening outings. Compared to other brands, it's a comparatively medium strength scent.   


Barber Shop has a very clean and professional, almost soap-ey scent. It's the least imposing of the three scents here and I could see it being good for a suit-and-tie office/morning interview setting.   


Music Festival is the sweetest of these three by a bit and definitely can leave a bit of a ghost of a scent on T-shirts worn over it. It's not so strong that it would be out of place for a brunch get-together, coffee-shop interview, or open house but it's not the first thing I would reach for when getting ready for a formal interview.   


Hope these were answering the questions you asked sufficiently.",best cologne
