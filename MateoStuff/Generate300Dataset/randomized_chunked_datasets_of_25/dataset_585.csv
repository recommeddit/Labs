26404,best politician,We got a congressman here
35844,best alcoholic drink,"No much of a drinker, but I like Guinness. Maybe some Jameson neat on the side. Then a nap."

4313,best text editor,PSPad is what I install on all my Windows boxes.
63298,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Apart from all these features, there's still one thing I'm wondering: why that package manager's name is Zebra?"
64797,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Little Caesars on Milpas.
63323,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,When sileo will be available on uncOver?
73552,best battery bank,"If I remember correctly, the Iphone X uses Power Delivery (not qualcomm's quick charge or other technologies) for quick charging, so you'll want a powerbank that supports ""Power Delivery"" (PD) and a USB-C to lightning cable for the fastest charging. Of Anker's 10k banks, the below support it. I'd go with the lightest if you have no other criteria. Someone more familiar with charging tech may want to double check this.

70499,best major to study in college,Also people who act cliquey and like high school never ended!
19399,best YouTube video,hello fellow deathlings
51274,best iphone case,"Nomad has the best leather cases IMO. only thing i would caution against is their Folio wallet case, as it tends to tear at the hinge easily. Mine tore within a few months, but then held on for a year before it tore completely off. Now i just use the phone case part, and will likely buy just the regular leather wallet from them for my 13 pro"
65140,best phone service company,AT&T is pretty crappy where I live
16164,best sunglasses for fashion,"Second Eyebuydirect. While they couldn't support my prescription, the pair I got for them feels pretty sturdy for the $30 I paid. That included a gradient tint, too."
22265,best celebrity,"This reminds me of a time when I was a freshman in college. I was eating in the cafeteria by the men's basketball team (basically 12 giants from 6'3"" to 6'10"") when this girl dropped her tray. One of the freshmen on the team started clapping and some of the upperclassmen told him to shut up and got up to help her. Pretty cool, especially when you consider that our team was really good and several of the guys went on to play professionally in Europe."
65296,best phone service company,"Thanks. Looks like you may have made them all lower case already, but upper case is still showing as an option. I could be wrong. I filter the upper case and nothing shows, but maybe I already filtered them out for some reason.

May have forgotten to say earlier: THANK YOU!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!!"
1684,best ice cream flavor,"The blood orange cream ice cream that I tried at the tillamook creamery visitors center last summer.  They said that the creamery exclusive flavors would be released to the general public in stores for 2019, and do far that is a lie."
729,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,Neat!
48292,best color to paint with,"That's a shitty tip right there. If you find the furniture you absolutely have to have, buy them. Before it's gone. If you get a deal on something, buy it. Don't wait."
73786,best matte screen protector for ipad,"It depends on how you are taking notes. I use a matte screen protector because i do a lot of writing for work with the Apple Pencil (meeting notes, planning, diagramming, etc). Glass is ""too fast"" of a feeling to write naturally. I used Paperlike and enjoyed it, currently using Bellemond and am liking it so far. Yes the image quality isn't as amazing as without it, but not a deal breaker, it's still really nice. 

Another option can be perhaps looking at nibs that give you a better feel for writing with the Pencil, however, i haven't seen any highly reviewed ones."
57891,best cologne,"It's called Sex Panther by Odeon. It's illegal in nine countries... Yep, it's made with bits of real panther, so you know it's good. They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time it works, every time."
45446,best gaming system,I like PS4 over Xbox because the controller is easier for me to hold.
10635,best suitcase lock,"Before you watch this 5 second tutorial, make sure you spend 4 minutes subscribing to my channel!"
39996,best Chrome extensions,"You have literally just solved a problem I've had for years. Without The Great Suspender, I'd have needed to buy more ram long ago. Yet, I've had a mysterious issue where Google websites give me errors and I'll need to delete my cookies cache to fix it weekly. I never connected that The Great Suspender could be causing it.

Thanks! I'll be switching over to The Great Discarder."
