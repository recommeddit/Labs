FT has the best bathroom situation. Portola food is still lousy but imo having only five guys to a bathroom is preferable to sharing one with the whole floor like Santa Rosa. Nasty af
"I'd say they're maybe one spot too high, not too big of a deal, especially when you consider that there's a strong recency bias towards them. In addition, they're the only club to have done the treble twice IIRC, which is a pretty big achievement in itself"
does vanessa carlton have more than one song? or just 'a 1000 miles' on repeat?
"similarly jesuit and benedictine monastic orders (maybe others, but IDK) require an undergrad degree to join, and a grad degree to become a father."
"Unless I missed it, I don't see DK Metcalf on the list, but I do see AJ Brown on there. That raised my eyebrow."
Need for speed Heat is really fun. Put in probably 80+ hrs into it trying to get all the upgrade parts and just racing with friends
"Most people focus so much on the Culture stuff that they miss out on all the other brilliant sciFi he's written. I recently re-read *Feersum Enjinn*, and dear god, that book is brilliant. I've also loved *The Algebraist* - the Dwellers run a close second to the Affront as my favorite species.

The short stories in *The State of The Art* are also really great."
"Might be partially a case of being from the northeast, but at my school...it wasnt. It was one of those wars that gets mentioned when one of its effects has an affect on another war, and thats sorta it to be honest."
Thank you so much for this.
"> I don't know why he's making a fuss about 0.5 points difference' anyway

"I just got one as well, fantastic in so many categories but my main gripes:

* The IPS glow is bad, like REALLY bad, even more distracting than the color shift I had on my previous TN panel.  Tweaking the levels and getting used to it has helped, but it's probably my biggest problem with the monitor
* The lack of DSC is also major letdown, not being able to do HDR at 240 Hz is going to bite me in the ass in the future, especially with Auto-HDR solutions arriving very soon
* The local dimming is garbage but that's just the way things are right now in the market

I had a ton of problems with my G7 and I did not regret returning it one bit"

"Anybody can sign up for free, you don't need to be an Argentinean citizen, so it's hard to tell."
"Really? They measure almost perfectly flat and I thought the whole point behind their sound design was to conform to a very accurate curve. Even Tyll said once when asked about the most uncolored headphones he's ever heard, mentioned them."
"Invest in a good leather briefcase. You'll be using it for years after you graduate, too."
"I can see your point, but Mead's course looks too... superficially complete. When I look through the section headings, that he was trying to make it sexy. Reacting isn't that sexy, it's the devil in details"
"[Canadian Smarties are the shizz.  Like M&M's, only with a better candy shell to chocolate ratio.](http://rateeveryanimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/smarties.jpg)  We call those powdery shit candies Rockets, I will only ever eat them out of sugar-craving desperation."
