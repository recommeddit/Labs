"Homework is on there, but not Analogue Worms Attack, or Cross? 

I hate when these lists confuse influential for good."
It should be noted that SCSS is the latest version of SASS.
A lot of people seem to hate that song but I actually really like it. I listen to it sometimes when I'm in a bad mood.
im sure someone has mentioned it already but cognac is brandy
"I think the better question is: What's the best browser for <insert use case here>?

Personally, I switch between Firefox, Chrome, Tor,  Brave, and Safari depending on the use case. I own 2 MacBook Pros, 1 Lenovo laptop, 1 iPad, 1 iPhone, and 1 Android phone.

My criteria for choosing my main browser are the following:

* sync
* ad-blocking
* support for other browser extensions I use
* good performance on lower-end hardware

With these considered, my main browser is Firefox. I use Chrome mainly for things I can't do,  or things not available on Firefox like this extension. [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpath-helper/hgimnogjllphhhkhlmebbmlgjoejdpjl?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpath-helper/hgimnogjllphhhkhlmebbmlgjoejdpjl?hl=en)

On the iPhone and iPad, I use Safari when I need ad-blocking. As far as I know, Firefox nor Chrome doesn't support content-blockers.

On Android, my main browser is Firefox but, though not a deal-breaker, it is a bit slow. So for quick searches, I use Chrome. Honestly, I mainly use Firefox for YouTube to block ads using [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ublock-origin/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ublock-origin/) ðŸ˜…

I use Safari on my Macs when I wanna use as little battery as possible. Brave and Tor I use when I want to do any browsing that I don't want to be associated with my Firefox and Chome accounts.

Reading through what I've typed here, this seems pretty tedious. But it's just something that gradually came into being after more than a decade of using browsers. ðŸ˜…"
Yea. Just wasnâ€™t a fan

This combination makes too much sense.
"You understand that everclear will burn your skin, right? Biology labs clean with ethanol no more concentrated than 140 proof.

The burn in your stomach and throat is your inner lining getting destroyed. It's really really bad for you.

EDIT: I'm not saying not to use everclear, but make sure to dilute it down a little bit before consuming. Mix it with cake vodka for a birthday cake fire shot. It's like a birthday candle"
That's because caulking is sold at your local home improvement store.

"Spanish Civil War. Study this if you have the slightest distaste for government, fascism, corporatism, oligarchy, etc. The truth of what happened is incredibly different from what the revised history we are taught.

The Anarchists fought the Nazis before anyone else on the planet.

They proved Anarchism could work, if we made an actual effort. Now, mind you, detractors will say 'but the Anarchists lost'. And that's not what I mean. They did lose, against Stalinists who betrayed them, Fascists who bombed civilians, and overwhelming odds.

But before that happened, they dropped the crime rate in areas they controlled. They equalized women. They coordinated massive health care and labour reforms without any government structure.

Standards of living, education and health went up in the areas they controlled. The Spanish Civil War was 'The Good Fight'. The war of Hemingway and Orwell. It was a war for freedom, for the belief and love of freedom.

All of humanity lost."
"My initial thought was Universal. They came out of a shaky early 2000's into the strong teens, and are entertaining 2020 full force.

But... then again that would be overlooking the blunders and shortcomings they've had along the way. Both Jimmy Fallon, and Fast and Furious both are not just minor, but wild duds, with still underwhelming rides like the Transformers Ride, and the continuous operational issues of Hagrids. 

Universal feels like a strong contender, but then the many negatives really do detract."
"The key is relationships. The frat guys in your university had the right idea all along: it doesn't matter what you know, but who you know.

Here's what you do: you pick an industry you want to work in, and you network the motherfucker out of that. I picked emerging technology and know a shit ton of startup founders. I basically landed myself where they hung out, started a blog about said founders, followed them obsessively and reached out to them via email, Skype, etc. Within 3 months, I had parlayed these introductions into relationships. Within one more month, they came to me when they needed help about something which I could do (which was writing). If they needed stuff for their blog, they came to me because they already knew me. If they needed ebooks and whitepapers, they came to me. I was their go-to source for writing the copy on their sites, and for marketing their stuff on the internet.

Be prepared to be without work for six months. In that period, do whatever you can to support yourself. In the meantime, you network like a motherfucker.

That's the secret to success: networking. Knowing people, and putting yourself out there. Liberal Arts guys have to work harder,  but trust me, if you learn this one skill, you will never be without work."

This was an excellent twist. It deserved to be in a better movie.
If you say so...
"No Personality traits? That's a lie. Her backstory is literally there to see and was made obvious, if you're too blind to see it, then that's your problem and subjective. Her relationship with Peter was non existent in the highschool years because they skipped this development. (Besides they only really connected in his college years anyways, in the comics too).

She was pretty and he obviously always liked her because of her looks just like in the comics bruh again, your criticism is subjective because it was established that he loved her from the beginning (and was narrated BY HIMSELF). Being a damsel is nothing bad at all in a superhero movie that's again, subjective criticism and not bad writing at all."

"My mom bitches about how cold the house is in the winter so last year I got her an electric blanket and she fucking loved it so much that she basically would spend all day wrapped up in it or would rush home just to wrap in it.

Forgot to mention I got her a $1000 tablet last year too, but she liked the blanket more"
