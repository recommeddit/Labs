This one’s a panty DROPPER
"My dad collected hot wheels, so I would go and get $30-$40 worth of them and wrap them individually. When he passed away he left me a steamer trunk full of them, still in the boxes. I have the trunk in my attic and still add to it on christmas and his birthday. One day I'll pass them down to my kids if I have any."
Came here to say this
"I'm about 100 pages in, and it feels like it's slowly creeping its way out of the scene-setting phase. So far I'm enjoying it a lot more than anything else of Stephenson's that I've read."
It's nothing in a erotic way. Just a casual picture of her and some other students enyoing a sauna or something like that. Nothing terrible but also nothing worth searching on bing. But enough to confirm that the mammoth cock rumours are false.
An absolute classic!

"When I was in a garage band in high school, everyone loved to fuck around on the drums when we took a break...I think everyone in the band could play a basic rock beat."
"As a kid of the 90's and a complete dork, I'm really excited to know that Tom Felton is a good guy. Yay!"
"...and actual frickin' chips, too! Not those cheap-ass tiny flecks. I'm lookin' at you, Franklins!"
"The experience of one CSU to another can be wildly different, like Dominguez Hills and San Diego State. I graduated from a CSU, and some of my classmates did get jobs on the east coast - the key difference is they had internships locally with the Big 4. Everyone seems to respect a CSU degree here, especially when it's from a local CSU. UC is the same way.... UCLA is a lot more impressive than UC Riverside or UC Merced.  My sister went to USC, seemed to open up a lot of doors for her because of all the connections she made there."
Depends what you want really.
I'm surprised Higher Ground by the Red Hot Chili Peppers wasn't on here
"I tried ynab and mint, but wasn’t a big fan. I got a google doc sheet layout off this sub and it’s been working pretty well. Easy and free, No ads, and Fully customizable. Glad I went this route!"
I have heard this so much. I feel like I never really understand how to maximize that.
Almost everything can be an euphemism for erection on reddit.
"I had the 3GS and Ioved it. It was my first smart phone. Now I have the 11 Pro Max. Man, technology has really advanced."
"Many states/countries don’t tax long term stays the same as hotel stays. Taking advantage of this can save you at minimum the taxes, plus more if you negotiate the room rate. I hope this helps!"
I like edge but it comes down to personal prefrence
"Honey lavender. It's perfectly sweet, with an expressive aroma. 

Also, earl grey."
"*Just stay the hell out of mischief, even just for a while!*

Have some mercy and don't give us moms anything more to worry about. It's exhausting. Please - we love you.

Sincerely,

Nerve-wracked mothers of teens"
What about the PS4 game? Please tell me you liked him in that?
"We made our own Berkey using a  replacement ceramic filter 4 pack and two large stock pots for much cheaper, and they're cleanable. It's crazy cheap, holds more water than pitchers by far, and tastes amazing. This is definitely the way to go"
