I quite like geany, it gives intelliguess functionality (""predictive text"") and also will list functions and variables in the side bar which can be very useful for rapid navigation of code.

46272,best trick or treating candy,"My favorite lady to go to in my town, had a little scary game or something you had to do every year, and then you got a regular size candy bar or reeses etc.

My other personal favorite was the dude who gave out cans of COKE, IT WAS AWESOME

Good Luck You are an awesome neighbor!"
