umm why?"
22428,best celebrity,"Worked on a Music video with both Pee Wee Herman, and Karen Gillan.

Pee Wee was super dickish and demanding and made the producers lives hell the whole time, and I only saw him when he was needed on set, had to be driven to and from his AC dressing room 30 minutes to film site. Complained the whole time. Had his own catering. Showed up late.

Karen was super chill. Ate with the crew, answered questions about Doctor Who and Marvel, did costume changes in a pass van, and was generally down to earth and charming. 

Also very tall. Wasn't expecting that. I have a hard time with super attractive women already,  and her towering over people really added to that."
47594,best state to visit in the United States,"The bluffs in the NE part of the state I hear are pretty cool to see. 

My parents kayaked some rivers up there and said as much."
22707,best celebrity,"I was an extra in one of the early Harry Potter films. One of my friends was standing near Emma Watson in a scene, and tried to start a conversation with her during one of the long-ass breaks between shooting (there were a lot of special effects to reset). She looked him up and down like he was a piece of shit. That was many years ago now, though, and I guess it's fairly likely she was just being a young teenage girl about it.

Rupert Grint was a legend though. I met him at another film I was in, and he remembered me like a year later. Only had a brief chat but he was clearly a genuinely nice guy."

57743,best cologne,"To anyone reading this: don't buy this unless you want to smell like 95% of all other men out there. It's a great scent, but holy cow everyone and their father wears it."
52444,best hiphop album,"Yeah I agree with everything you said and I’d like to reiterate that I still think it’s a great album lol. But yeah I love my experimental shit and production tends to captivate me more than lyrics in my long term views of an album, unless the lyrics are remarkable like TPAB or APOS, both of which are accompanied by some incredible beats. Guess I’m just not in love with 90’s boom bap production as a whole."

54172,best medicine for a cold,"Hi ... emergency pediatrician here.  Not talking about any person's illness specifically here, but about colds in general.  Brace yourself.  NOTHING REALLY WORKS.    

Pseudphedrine in doses big enough to muck up sleep might make the nasal congestion somewhat better, sometimes lots better.  Fluids are good because of the buckets of snot you are eliminating from your body (= fluid loss) and because you want to keep that stuff nice and runny (not stiff and sticky).  In patients with no contraindications, ibuprofen helps with the headache, the muscle aches and the sore throat.      
So as a professional, what do I do?  Two ounces of scotch, lots of tea, regular ibuprofen for pain, and goooooooood movies.    

Hope this helps ..."
32758,best vacation resort,"That is on our list currently. It's been tough and many have removed only to be put back on. RIU looks nice, the reviews are consistent and the placement at the top of the 7 is good. But I get more of a ""hotel"" vibe than a resort one. I think it's due to not really being spread out. But I haven't written it off yet."
