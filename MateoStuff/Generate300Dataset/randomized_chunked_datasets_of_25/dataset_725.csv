70134,best major to study in college,"I majored in IR as well! Really interesting subject and enjoyable course.

Don't believe all the stuff about IR majors being unemployable. I do corporate strategy for a multinational; it's a great fit for the skills learnt in an IR degree. It's also interesting and well paid."

38368,best newspapers to read,"A lot of comments here are recommending big names like the New York Times and the Washington Post. I agree in part. The content they offer is certainly worth it, especially if you want a national or international perspective; but overemphasizing them as a primary place for news will notably ignore most of the issues local to you and [contribute to the trend that's pushing out smaller papers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/media/ben-smith-journalism-news-publishers-local.html). (They're also often notoriously long; they aren't kidding when they say it's ""all the news that's fit to print,"" and because of it, you'll likely miss a lot of their stories in the deluge they offer you, unless you spend a lot of time to work through everything.) As such, it might be good to try someplace else first, and see if that might fit you, before defaulting to the big names.

Given that, if you're unwilling to go with your local paper, I think other magazines like The Atlantic are your best shot due to being more tightly curated. These include your standard fare, like The New Yorker, Harper's, New York, The Economist, Vanity Fair, Esquire, Christian Science Monitor; but also magazines that cater to particular political perspectives, like The Nation, The New Republic, Mother Jones, Jacobin, and Reason; or magazines that focus on specific hobbies, like Scientific American, The Fader, Quanta, Wired, and Sports Illustrated. (That last one in particular might be of interest if you want sports stories.) 

(If you like The Atlantic because of their in-depth and expository storytelling, you might also enjoy looking [through this site](https://longform.org/), which essentially compiles high-quality long-form stories from basically any relevant publication. It's helped me find plenty of new sources that I find myself regularly returning to.)"
34953,best NFL player,One could argue a deceased focus on the running game is good for a big running back like Henry.
20605,best workout music,"Anything by Hatebreed. I used to listen to 'Destroy Everything' before my wrestling matches in high school.

Lamb of God is great for working out too. 'One Gun' is one of my favorites.

Vicious Circles by Veil of Maya is a pretty intense song. it's fast and heavy while still having sort of a cool melody."
42233,movies like Inception,"Perfect Blue, while you are at it. Same studio, I think."

7417,best laptop for general use,"Last question (hopefully), lol: 

If I bump my budget up to $1500, does your recommendation change to any of the laptops under your $1300+ chart?"
13654,best research paper archive,"Does this apply to just scientific journals, or other journals as well (such as history)?"
6411,best Netflix documentary,The Fog of War. 2003 documentary featuring extensive interview and archival footage with former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Very good
72812,best Linux distro,Twitch something? Like what? I think I have find some tutorial online.
41319,best instrument to play,French Horn and the opening statement of Jupiter from Holst's The Planets.
70819,best movies with a cool twist,Yeah I feel like telling someone a movie has a twist kinda ruins it.
45123,best items under $100,What kind? I‚Äôm thinking about getting one.
36797,best alcoholic drink,"Ste. Chapelle Soft Huckleberry Wine is my all-time fave. But I'm a bit of a wino so I'm not extremely picky:)

If I want something light, I love hard seltzers. If I wanna go to a bar and get drunk, I love vodka crans and rum & coke."

4055,best online college,"I will say that with Designlab, the workforce skills you‚Äôre talking about were highly stressed. No lesson was presented without considering the functionality within an actual workplace. My mentor was constantly training me on how to answer stakeholder questions, etc. 

See my reply to the above comment for more details about my experience. Or feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions!"
38179,best Marvel movie,"On RT I only pay attention to the Top Critics score. Endgame wins 93% to 74%. You have Metacritic wrong: Endgame has 78, Infinity War 68. It's clear critics preferred Endgame.

Audience scores on websites are based on self-selected samples and mean nothing. On CinemaScore, a professionally administered survey, Endgame received an A+ to Infinity War's A. Dollars are another form of voting. Endgame wins that one easily, too.

This is pretty open & shut."
73305,best Linux distro,I do have one small regret after embracing Linux Mint and other Debian based distros over the past 10+ years. I have found my employers use RHEL or CentOS. In hind sight I might have forced myself to use CentOS. Thankfully I‚Äôm a network guy that occasionally logs into a nix server.
68804,best science fiction novel,"When we started the poll quite a few fantasy titles were submitted and we didn't want to alienate the people who want to include those. It is a ""speculative fiction"" list but slanted toward science fiction (as PrintSF tend to be)."
