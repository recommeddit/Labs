Don't believe all the stuff about IR majors being unemployable. I do corporate strategy for a multinational; it's a great fit for the skills learnt in an IR degree. It's also interesting and well paid.",best major to study in college

38368,"A lot of comments here are recommending big names like the New York Times and the Washington Post. I agree in part. The content they offer is certainly worth it, especially if you want a national or international perspective; but overemphasizing them as a primary place for news will notably ignore most of the issues local to you and [contribute to the trend that's pushing out smaller papers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/media/ben-smith-journalism-news-publishers-local.html). (They're also often notoriously long; they aren't kidding when they say it's ""all the news that's fit to print,"" and because of it, you'll likely miss a lot of their stories in the deluge they offer you, unless you spend a lot of time to work through everything.) As such, it might be good to try someplace else first, and see if that might fit you, before defaulting to the big names.

Given that, if you're unwilling to go with your local paper, I think other magazines like The Atlantic are your best shot due to being more tightly curated. These include your standard fare, like The New Yorker, Harper's, New York, The Economist, Vanity Fair, Esquire, Christian Science Monitor; but also magazines that cater to particular political perspectives, like The Nation, The New Republic, Mother Jones, Jacobin, and Reason; or magazines that focus on specific hobbies, like Scientific American, The Fader, Quanta, Wired, and Sports Illustrated. (That last one in particular might be of interest if you want sports stories.) 

(If you like The Atlantic because of their in-depth and expository storytelling, you might also enjoy looking [through this site](https://longform.org/), which essentially compiles high-quality long-form stories from basically any relevant publication. It's helped me find plenty of new sources that I find myself regularly returning to.)",best newspapers to read

38179,"On RT I only pay attention to the Top Critics score. Endgame wins 93% to 74%. You have Metacritic wrong: Endgame has 78, Infinity War 68. It's clear critics preferred Endgame.

Audience scores on websites are based on self-selected samples and mean nothing. On CinemaScore, a professionally administered survey, Endgame received an A+ to Infinity War's A. Dollars are another form of voting. Endgame wins that one easily, too.
