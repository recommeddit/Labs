Occupying area isn't enough, it needs to be Germanic. Preferably by being densely populated by Germans. If he could have taken over the Soviet Union and then conjured up 300 million extra Germans to populate it and Eastern Europe somehow, I'm sure he would have continued with the expansion. Alas, going from 100m to 400m population would have taken far longer than Hitlers lifespan.

Taking over more territory would have simply made Grossdeutchland more ""polluted"".",best Mexican war to study

A few years ago I wanted to find a copy of ‚ÄúMutually Orthogonal Latin Squares of Order 10‚Äù by E.T. Parker, mentioned in Knuth‚Äôs ‚ÄúSelected Papers on Discrete Math‚Äù.

Couldn‚Äôt find it online anywhere, but found it had been published in conference proceedings in 1963.

Went to my local library.  They didn‚Äôt have it, but told me they could probably find it.

3 days later I had the freshly scanned pdf emailed to me, along with a request to pay $3.81 next time I came by the library.

This isn‚Äôt some major university library either... this is the local community library in Purcellville, VA.",best research paper archive

27781,"Oatmeal is pretty great and easy. I like to add walnuts and bananas. Always cook it with milk.

Hardboiled eggs are an easy grab-and-go. I especially like pickled eggs.

I like to mix Post raisin bran (it has the most fiber of the raisin brans at my grocery store) with a little bit of granola and eat it with plain yogurt.

This morning was cottage cheese with fresh tomato from my garden.

If I have just a little more time, I love breakfast sandwiches. I use a large mug or small bowl, sprayed with cooking oil, and beat an egg and maybe a little milk in it. Cover it with a plate and microwave for one minute, stirring halfway through. It makes a perfect Egg McMuffin style disc of scrambled egg. I serve it on an English muffin, sometimes with a slice of cheese.",best breakfast foods

TL;DW: Clean cut: if the LG 27GL850 is sold out, buy the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. Or wait.

&#x200B;

I've done extensive research on the subject and the best 1440p, 144hz monitors on the market are the LG 27GL850 and the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. The argument for both is this:

LG 27GL850: Best picture/colors, best motion control. Con: its blacks aren't the deepest (but it is an IPS monitor, so that makes sense).

ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ: Has better blacks than the LG 27GL850 (however, it's also an IPS monitor as well so that's not saying much). Cons: Not as good colors as the LG 27GL850 and if the monitor drops below 80 FPS (some say 100 FPS) it has some type of issue (I forget exactly what it is. You can find it easily though if you use google to find reddit threads that compare the two monitors).

The VAST major of people think the LG 27GL850 is better (including me). The LG 27GL83a is almost the same except its color is worse and it's like $100 cheaper.
