30542,best Mexican war to study,"Yes, but the expansion would require time. After all, he wasn't building an Empire in the old school sense of the word: he was building a super nation-state.

Occupying area isn't enough, it needs to be Germanic. Preferably by being densely populated by Germans. If he could have taken over the Soviet Union and then conjured up 300 million extra Germans to populate it and Eastern Europe somehow, I'm sure he would have continued with the expansion. Alas, going from 100m to 400m population would have taken far longer than Hitlers lifespan.

Taking over more territory would have simply made Grossdeutchland more ""polluted""."
3340,best webcamera,"Kind of piggybacking on this, but if you really want to invest in something that will make your stream look good, spend the money you save on an expensive camera and invest in lighting.  Get some floor lamps you can point at you, some clip lights, anything that will brighten your face.  The best camera in the world will look like hot garbage without good lighting."

13940,best research paper archive,"Your local library. Seriously.

A few years ago I wanted to find a copy of ‚ÄúMutually Orthogonal Latin Squares of Order 10‚Äù by E.T. Parker, mentioned in Knuth‚Äôs ‚ÄúSelected Papers on Discrete Math‚Äù.

Couldn‚Äôt find it online anywhere, but found it had been published in conference proceedings in 1963.

Went to my local library.  They didn‚Äôt have it, but told me they could probably find it.

3 days later I had the freshly scanned pdf emailed to me, along with a request to pay $3.81 next time I came by the library.

This isn‚Äôt some major university library either... this is the local community library in Purcellville, VA."

I can never find strawberry ice cream without strawberries in the store though."

27781,best breakfast foods,"Oatmeal is pretty great and easy. I like to add walnuts and bananas. Always cook it with milk.

Hardboiled eggs are an easy grab-and-go. I especially like pickled eggs.

I like to mix Post raisin bran (it has the most fiber of the raisin brans at my grocery store) with a little bit of granola and eat it with plain yogurt.

This morning was cottage cheese with fresh tomato from my garden.

If I have just a little more time, I love breakfast sandwiches. I use a large mug or small bowl, sprayed with cooking oil, and beat an egg and maybe a little milk in it. Cover it with a plate and microwave for one minute, stirring halfway through. It makes a perfect Egg McMuffin style disc of scrambled egg. I serve it on an English muffin, sometimes with a slice of cheese."

47430,best state to visit in the United States,"Seattle's a pretty nice place to visit. I have family up there that I visited a couple years ago. If you don't mind lots of rain, then Seattle is definitely a place to go to.

Not on topic, but funnily enough, for the entire duration I was in Seattle, it didn't rain a drop. It rained the day before I arrived, didn't rain even once while I was there, then immediately began to gently rain as the plane I was on took off."

TL;DW: Clean cut: if the LG 27GL850 is sold out, buy the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. Or wait.

&#x200B;

I've done extensive research on the subject and the best 1440p, 144hz monitors on the market are the LG 27GL850 and the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ. The argument for both is this:

LG 27GL850: Best picture/colors, best motion control. Con: its blacks aren't the deepest (but it is an IPS monitor, so that makes sense).

ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ: Has better blacks than the LG 27GL850 (however, it's also an IPS monitor as well so that's not saying much). Cons: Not as good colors as the LG 27GL850 and if the monitor drops below 80 FPS (some say 100 FPS) it has some type of issue (I forget exactly what it is. You can find it easily though if you use google to find reddit threads that compare the two monitors).

The VAST major of people think the LG 27GL850 is better (including me). The LG 27GL83a is almost the same except its color is worse and it's like $100 cheaper.

&#x200B;

So that's about it."
10826,best suitcase lock,"I fly a lot and started having my bags checked pretty frequently. I've had 2 cell phone chargers disappear, and a bottle of conditioner left open enough to spill all over my bag. I had packed it in a ziploc bag with the shampoo, but found it out of the bag next to a nice little note from the TSA saying they checked it. I started flying with a firearm and haven't had any issues since. It only takes a couple extra minutes and is totally worth it to me even if not traveling with ""valuables."""

10772,best suitcase lock,"I one time filled my checked luggage to the max weight of 50 lbs with individually bubble wrapped, and quite annoyingly taped, beer bottles. At my destination, every single bottle was unwrapped and rewrapped using ""inspected by tsa"" tape. Interestingly, the original tape was not cut, but there was tons of evidence of frustration by the way it was all stretched. 

I picture this pissed off tsa agent struggling with every bottle while a barrel of confiscated blades sits not too far away."
24853,best spiderman actor,"Really!  So you hated the book series, but liked the movie version with Andrew Garfield.  I thought those movies were based off of Bendis' work.  I might be off.

So you identified with the character.  He was more of a modern day youth.  More of a millenial character than previous spiderman versions."
