35404,best alcoholic drink,"All the bartenders and “evolved” alcohol drinkers will crucify me for this buuuut...

Get two gallons of that nice apple cider. On the stove, boil some with like a cup or so of brown sugar, a handful of cinnamon sticks, a thinly sliced apple (I did circle slices for aesthetic, same way as an orange), circle orange slices, and some vanilla. Simmer it after it reaches a boil for quite awhile, your home should smell like a pie. 

Now you should have quite a bit of cider on the side, put that into a different container so the jars are empty. After you take your mixture off the heat and it has completely cooled, split it between the two gallon jars. 

Now split an entire ever clear bottle (I do 190 proof) between the two evenly. Also add a cup or so of spiced rum to each then top off with leftover cider. 

I always let this sit for a month or two just so the sugar really blends with the alcohol, but of course you can drink it sooner. 

You can drink it as is, take shots, or use it as a mixer with more cider or get creative. It’ll taste soooo damn smooth, but it’s incredibly strong. I need to test the abv one of these days."
63665,best books for time management reddit,"Thanks for the suggestion! I have one reservation about this one, maybe someone can help me clear it up? It was recommended to us that my husband and I read The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Marriages. I was fully willing to give it a shot. Until it got to the part where it said *basically* said, and again I am summarizing, ""This book won't help you if your partner has a mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Your relationship probably cannot be saved."" Something like that. Well, I have bipolar 1/schizoaffective disorder. So I didn't care to read on after that. 

Is the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People going to tell me it's only meant for people with ""normal"" brains? I don't mean to sound over sensitive but it was kind of a huge burn. I'd never been shit on by a self help book before"

7191,best iPhone,"Bigger and also higher resolution display, Face ID, and two day battery on the XR makes that price difference justifiable for me."
29998,best money managing app,"I’ve used and tested scores. I’ve found nothing better than “finances” which has both iOS and MacOS versions, and in iOS well formatted versions for iPhone and iPad. https://hochgatterer.me/finances/guide/introduction/
There is an affordable cost, but no monthly fee.
What I love most is the ability to put in repeating future entries — say expected payroll checks, expected costs like electricity, internet, car payment. It will show your future balances.
And you can have different “accounts” like bank account, savings account, money on hand. You can move money from one account to another.
It works for me and has for several years, and it’s not crazy complicated.
Hope this helps, as I know how frustrating looking for an affordable program can be, especially one that works and syncs between devices, and can be shared with your partner all for one purchase that’s not priced to the moon."

62890,Best Data Science textbook,"It's on my list, I've really been wanting to read this."
7223,best iPhone,"Just got a refurbished 8 for 430€. Should arrive on monday and to me it's a bit over my spending limkt for phones (400) but i guess it should be worth it. 

I'd say 7 if you're really after a budget phone.

8 is in between.

XR if you have the money to spare i guess."

56387,best desktop monitor,"Exactly. I switched from AOC 27G2 (IPS) to AOC CQ27G2 (VA) and the black smearing is obvious. I gained higher resolution but lost a lot of motion clarity.

The IPS at low overdrive is clearer than the VA at max overdrive.

However, the high contrast ratio is quite nice."
