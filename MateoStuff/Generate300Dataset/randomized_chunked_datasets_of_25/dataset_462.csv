64512,Best Nike running shoes,"Here's what I wanna know though...I liked the Pegasus up til #30 mostly because it had great cushioning. After that they got more solid I feel like. And my knees felt it too. I still havent found a good shoe to replace them with, but I have to admit I havent really looked that hard... Mostly cause I keep hoping with every new Pegasus release that they'll go back to amazing cushioning. But alas.. Any tips?"

35042,best NFL player,"I respectfully disagree that there are many you could make a reasonable argument for.  I think there are a small handful you could, but I think it's single digits for sure."
67117,best places to skydive in california,"In my limited experience what you're saying are partially not true. As a student at Perris I had good relationships with most of the instructors and some experienced jumpers. Administration at Perris is also awesome, you know, Dan BC. But I do agree that smaller DZs might be more personal. Perris is a big DZ so sometimes it can be impersonal."
33160,best energy drink,"I had a bad addiction to energy drinks.  AMP mostly.  Kicked that habit though.  Smoking also.  but for some reason, I am not seeing the money I am supposed to be saving by not purchasing those items...."
31866,best hotel to live in,"I’ve stayed at Portofino, Hard Rock and Cabana Bay. Here’s my best to worst ranking:

Portofino- Hands down the most luxurious and relaxing. You’re transported to another place when you come back from a long day at the parks.  It’s nice and quiet and the pools are great. They also just renovated the rooms. 

Cabana Bay - the theming is great and atmosphere is a lot of fun. My only complaint was it’s long distance from the parks (no water taxi) and thin walls. 

Hard Rock - I stayed in a club level room here and honestly was not impressed. I thought the hallway, room and club lounge looked quite dirty for what you’re paying. The rock theme is cool and you can’t beat the closeness to the parks but I deeply regretted not stating at Portofino again."
57535,best cologne,"Royal Mayfair 

Gucci Pour Homme II

Both by the same dude. He has good taste but doesn’t wear any fragrance himself."

47862,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,Yea I went ahead and picked up a ti84 just now. I actually got a ti89 first but after playing with it a bit it was a bit overwhelming learning all of the new stuff about the calculator so I just went back to what I'm used to which is the ti84

23173,best social networking site for CS,"I'm guessing there's an age limit of 13 or something =)

But otherwise, the sooner the better, and the more people 'in' your network now, the more data you'll see down the line when you're thinking of applying to company and it turns out that your old college classmate works there now."
61299,Best RPG game on PS4,"I freaking LOVED Type 0. I wish the combat wouldn't be as clunky and shallow, but the rest is perfection in my opinion. It's the most extremely graphical Final Fantasy I've ever played, the story is tragic and mindblow, the characters are all diverse with different nice playstyles... and the music, holy jesus of RPGs."
