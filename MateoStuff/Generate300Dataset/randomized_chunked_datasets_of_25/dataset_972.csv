https://youtu.be/SC7q6e983cE

My 2 cents, i have no doubts each company will produce and sell these 2 vehicles. So it's really a question of which one will come out first (""which one is further along"" is kind of a meaningless vague question). MY2022 means the hummer will probably come out end of 2021."
1487,best ice cream flavor,"Top 3:

- Coolhaus balsamic fig mascarpone

- Haagen Dazs creme brulee (discontinued; dulche de leche is close but not the same)

- In the 90s Godiva had an amazing white chocolate raspberry ice cream. I’ve tried others but none compare.

Flavor I didn’t think I would like but did: Creamistry has an incredible Capn Crunch flavor. I don’t like Capn Crunch and would have never tried it if they weren’t handing out samples one day. It’s very good.

Weirdest flavor: I thought I would love black sesame but I didn’t like it at all."
32703,best vacation resort,I think it has it's time and place. My parents and I went on vacation in Cozumel and stayed in my first all inclusive. We also had a car so we could go to the town and other Mayan ruins. But it was nice for us because we didn't have to worry about dinner or drinks and you could pay a small fee for water activities and scuba all you want ( which is what we went for) they also were able to set up a way to get to chichen itza without going on the big tour bus.

43821,best items under $100,"A second swing (used) so my twins could nap in them as babies. It was maybe $40, and it was worth every penny. I could not deal with newborns taking 20 minute crap naps that only overlapped by 5 minutes and then being super cranky because they didn’t nap. 

We transitioned them to napping in cribs around 8 months, so their sleep wasn’t ruined. And in the meantime, Mama had some sanity."

41062,best instrument to play,"So I'm a keyboard novice, but I find its relatively simple to get started and an okay amateur keyboard (no weighted keys or anything) is pretty cheap. If you have the space, unlike me, people throw away pianos all the time, but if you're limited on space and funds then a keyboard might be your best bet.

I've also playesld the ukulele, but imo keyboard is more fun."

30452,best Mexican war to study,"Im working on my doctorate in history... (soon.. when i have money again.. sigh)

WW1 is for me one of the most fascinating periods of war in the world, the ground war is a horribly depressing thing, and that is well covered, but few people know much about the war at sea, which is actually very fascinating, if you are interested, Robert K Massey wrote two excellent books about it, and they are an excellent intro into the period:

Dreadnought, which covers the pre-war arms race, and is very well written, its the book i recommend to non-history people to get them started, as its very accesible but also accurate, http://www.amazon.com/Dreadnought-Robert-K-Massie/dp/0345375564/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t

Castles of Steel, which covers the war period itself, and the actions of the british navy, again, exceedingly well written, and very accesible, it reads liek a novel, and exposes the personalities that commanded both the german and british fleets. 
http://www.amazon.com/Castles-Steel-Britain-Germany-Winning/dp/0345408780/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281112593&sr=1-1

(My master's thesis was inspired by Massey, i covered the SMS Goeben and the repercusions of her entry into the bosporus, which precipitated events that caused the fall of the ottoman empire...)

For WW2 stuff, most of everything is well covered, if you want something little known about, and well, frankly a bit depressing, pick up:

The 900 Days, the siege of Leningrad by Harrison Salisbury, it covers a 3 year period few int he west know too much about, and its a very vivid telling of not only the conduct of the siege itself, but the deprivations the inhabitants of the city suffered, i had the misfortune of reading this book in the winter, and as tacky as it sounds, every time i stepped out to catch the train when i was reading this book, and dealt with the boston winters, i just felt a wave of distress, recalling what i had read in the book, its weird to describe it.

Last thing i will recommend, is, if you are at all interested in the american civil war, i would highly recommend Battlecry of freedom, by James McPherson, I know everyone and their mother LOVES ken burns and the civil war and it is excellent.............. but its unfortunately not terribly accurate, one of my professor is a civil war expert and took our class through the documentary, and we found something like 1 factual error every 2-3 minutes. Battlecry is more modern, and very well researched and written.

quick edit:

http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Power-Upon-History-1660-1783/dp/0486255093

Alfred Thayer Mahan's Influence of seapower is credited repeatedly as one of the most influential, yet least known books in history, it practically caused WW1, and was a bible to progressive minds in the British royal navy, and the German imperial navy, its also credited by ww2 us admirals, Yamamoto himself  studied it extensively, and i think its still required reading at Annapolis.


Long Edit now that im off work, and im in front of my library, i wont go into as much detail for the sake of brevity, but these are all quite good, these are the accessible ones... most of my library is very very technical or difficult stuff. (my apologies to the non-euro centric people, i am actually fascinated by the Mughal Empire in india, and the three kingdoms period of chinese history, but both scholarly and common works seem to be rare in english, spanish, german, or anything else i can read in :(  if someone who sees this has any recommendation, i would love to hear them)

WW2 era:

http://www.amazon.com/Alamo-Ardennes-American-Soldiers-Bastogne/dp/0471739057
excellent look at the overall battle, and a good look at alot of the units that are often overlooked (IE non paras)

http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Britain-Greatest-Air-World/dp/039302766X
overview of the battle of britain, a little on the technical side, but very good overall

http://www.amazon.com/Lose-Battle-France-1940/dp/0140134301
why the French got kicked in ww2, its actually a really fascinating story, and quite demonstrative of what bad management can do.

inter-war:

http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Fear-American-Depression-1929-1945/dp/0195038347
this book is almost un-explainable how good it is, and how comprehensive, fair warning, it is beyond massive in scope, but it is crucial to understanding america during the interwar and ww2 years.

Korea:

http://www.amazon.com/Korean-War-Da-Capo-Paperback/dp/0306802678
excellent book by general ridgeway, good for looking at command level thinking (biased of course, but not too badly)

US civil war:

http://www.amazon.com/Last-Best-Hope-Earth-Abraham/dp/0674511263
lincoln synopsis, one of the best ones, good short read

cold war 

http://www.amazon.com/Blind-Mans-Bluff-Submarine-Espionage/dp/1891620088
a ""good read"" book great insight into the US submarine spy programs

tons more of course... i probably own 20 books about trafalgar, nowadays anything you pick up will be good on that end

also, this is cliched now, but obligatory

http://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393317552
guns germs steel, read it, it explains northern/european ""dominance"" 

figure thats enough, hope someone reads this :)"
