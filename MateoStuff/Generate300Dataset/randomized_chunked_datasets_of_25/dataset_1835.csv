33281,best electric car,"Fair. The truck to home is an added feature but one I don’t really care about as my solar system has a battery, so it’s unlikely I’d use it. The battery on the base model is “small” but still rated at 230 miles while pulling 1000 pounds, and up to 400+ miles empty. 

Again, I looked at the base model and didn’t really see much that I would want to pay more for. I have a side hustle handyman business of sorts so it will most likely pay for itself."
