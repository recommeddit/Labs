69992,best major to study in college,"Computer Engineering, not Computer science like some people bring up.

Edit: what i mean is i don't want to major in CS, i understand that i will  be learning a lot of it with Comp E"
4750,best home improvement store,"I like the Depot better as an in-person store but god save you if you have to order something from them. They fucked pretty hard with me when I tried to get molding delivered. Couldn't order a certain molding from any other Depot or get it shipped in from a national Depot warehouse. And I had to call *them* to find out when they were going to deliver. I was bouncing around their phones like a pinball trying to get to the delivery department. Finally got 'em 3 calls later. Called again 4 PM day of, and only THEN did they tell me 6-8 PM. So I said fuck it, drove there and killed the order in person. My name was first on their delivery whiteboard, so presumably I'd be the day's first delivery. Between 6 and 8 PM. And I was the closest to the store.

Lowe's out-and-out told me the day and time of my delivery at order. And they came right on time.

Uncle is a vet and he gets a discount through Lowe's, but not the Depot. So if you're a military supporter you know where to go.

Also, Lowe's has a 10% mover's coupon if you change your address thru usps.com."
26248,best politician,"Harry-ass Truman. The guy damn well created the post Cold War geopolitical situation. All other presidents just worked off the framework he established with the Berlin Airlift, NATO, Korea and the Marshall Plan."
13337,best spreadsheet editor,I like Google sheets but sadly I can’t use vlookup or any formulas I think across different files like with excel so Excel wins for me.
47249,best state to visit in the United States,"It's a shame the games are all over winter, we wanted a bit of sun as well, but I guess late September wouldn't be too bad? Aren't there quite a lot of lightening storms around this time though?"

1318,best ice cream flavor,The best! I even use my whey protein in cookies n creme flavor.
23039,best celebrity,"I worked the Sundance film festival in the 90's as a projectionist.  Samuel L Jackson came up to me outside & asked for a light for his smoke.  We chatted while we smoked.  VERY nice guy and asked me about my job.  Best smoke break I ever took.

Another encounter was Lawrence Fishburn....I saw him poking a steamer tray full of salad with a big serving spoon then not take any.  Say ""Lawrence Fishburn"" to me and I don't think of Morpheus or any other of his great characters...I think of a guy poking a steamer tray of sketchy pasta salad and not taking any."
26875,best board games,I really enjoyed **Whistle Mountain**. It uses that shared board element you mentioned to great effect.
41567,best instrument to play,Do you think it’s harder than violin?
45682,best trick or treating candy,"Amen. A-fucking-men.

Reese's Cups are the only correct answer here. (Alternate answer: Reese's pumpkins.)

But I have one quibble with your worst one. Candy corn is atrocious, yes, but [this abomination](http://www.candycornmms.com/mms-candy-corn-9oz.jpg) takes the cake."

54693,best water filter,"Just wondering, do you replace them when the light comes on, or do you let them go a bit longer? Mine comes on way more often than 4x a year. I'll usually go a few weeks after before replacing.

Note: the cheapest place for the filters seems to be from BJ's Wholesale Club if you have one near you. There are usually coupons available for them too."
70673,best movies with a cool twist,The Prestige is amazing...I'm still arguing with the people I watched it with about >!(what we think actually happened in)!< the ending though
51448,best iphone case,"Silicon is good? I have some doubts with the silicon texture and my pocket, no?"
5287,best home improvement store,"Society6 is my go-to for artwork. The prices are relatively reasonable, and there are a lot of unique prints available."
5842,best programming language for web development,"You won’t get far by going by what others like. Try them out. Grab ASP.NET Core, Django, Node.js etc and do a couple of tutorials. See which feels nice to you. They all can basically do everything you want and all have their pros and cons. You’ll want the “best” for you and that can only be found by trying things out. Especially when still learning things. You’ll want a system that doesn’t have a lot of hidden quirks you have to consider."
