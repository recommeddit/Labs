62022,Best RPG game on PS4,"Bloodborne! Doing my 3rd playthrough atm. Such a masterpiece. Wish I could get into Witcher 3, but after bloodborne, every other game feels clunky in the fight mechanics"
2807,best headphones,"I've got an old wired Logitech H390 that I've used for years, but is starting to go out in 1 ear. Last November I got a cat, and it would just be so much easier to interact with the cat if my headphones are wireless. I'm not really a music listener and just need something for generic MMO/MOBA game audio and Push to Talk Discord chat. I was fine with the Logitech H800's sound/mic, but the foam pads gave me a scab on my ear... Seems like ""decent overall"" would fit what I'm looking for, so initially leaning to the MH670. By high clamp do you mean it strongly squeezes the sides of your head? Would you also say mic monitoring is important for someone who has only used on ear not over ear headsets? In that case maybe the Cloud Flight might be better? I really wish there was just a wireless version of the H390. Maybe I need to be looking more at office headsets, but they all seem to be Bluetooth or $300+"

44856,best items under $100,">socks.

This especially. I think most people who work on their feet realize good boots/shoes are worth it, but the socks make a world of difference as well. I don't care if they're $15 for a three pack, they're fucking worth it."

53364,best usb c charging cable,"> Amazon.com co-mingles third party sellers , you never know what you get

Yes, unless buying AmazonBasics. 

Cannot imagine that Amazon would accept AmazonBasics product from third party sellers.

The Gen 1 and Gen 2 AmazonBasics cables are tremendously impressive.  Better build quality than Monoprice and every bit the equal to Anker.  All while at lower prices and a much wider variety of lengths and colors."
