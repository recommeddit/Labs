44654,"Every skin care routine should include a wash, moisturizer and exfoliate.
Cerave is good and budget conscious, as well as The Ordinary. 
ALWAYS use an SPF in the morning even if it is cloudy. Make sure it is 30+. Mineral sunscreens are preferable as natural and not bad for the Ocean Reefs.
Exfoliate a few times a week, preferably with a chemical exfoliant like Salicylic Acid or Lactic Acid. Physical exfoliants for your skin, like that garbage St. Ives, just damage your skin more than it does do what an exfoliant is supposed to do. Do this only in the evening as it makes your skin more prone to sun damage.
