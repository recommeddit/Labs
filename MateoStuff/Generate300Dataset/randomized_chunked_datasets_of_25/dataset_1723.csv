51070,best rap album,"Cool to see A Grand Don't Come For Free crack the top 100. The Streets doesn't often get the attention it deserves. The last song, Empty Cans is brilliant."

49016,best gaming monitor,I feel the color is a little funky but it's probably because I have two monitors with different screen types. For the price it's been great. Also it overclocks to 155hz and I haven't noticed any negative side affects.

37112,best amusement park,"I agree with you on Magnum, but the ranking seems to reflect the average person's opinion about it in this subreddit, though.

I didn't mean to seem disparaging to coasters that didn't make it in the top 500. I used that word as a simple way to make the context of what I'm doing more digestible to the average reader."

44654,best items under $100,"Every skin care routine should include a wash, moisturizer and exfoliate.
Cerave is good and budget conscious, as well as The Ordinary. 
ALWAYS use an SPF in the morning even if it is cloudy. Make sure it is 30+. Mineral sunscreens are preferable as natural and not bad for the Ocean Reefs.
Exfoliate a few times a week, preferably with a chemical exfoliant like Salicylic Acid or Lactic Acid. Physical exfoliants for your skin, like that garbage St. Ives, just damage your skin more than it does do what an exfoliant is supposed to do. Do this only in the evening as it makes your skin more prone to sun damage.
