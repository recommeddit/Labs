As author you basically give your work for someone to make money out of it.
Could very well be. I have some of their headphones and I'd say they're not at all far from the model (usually Sennheisers) they were going for.
"Get A Life, Chloe Brown is a great place to start with her, but my favorite may be The Princess Trap. But honestly, she only has one or two books that I don’t love, the rest are all amazing."
"A girl here on Reddit posted a story on how RDJr helped her grandmother when she fell and hurt herself in an award show or something, even using his suit to help stop her bleeding and walking her to the ambulance. She then bumped into him years later when he was going through his tough drug abuse times and thanked him for it and it he was touched, said ""he really needed to hear that"". 

EDIT: 1100 Upvotes for briefly mentioning a story that I read on Reddit once? Lot of RDJr love in this place , I see!"

"Ok I floss everyday. What I've learned is #1, don't cheap out on floss. Yeah it might be $2 less to get the shitty store brand, but floss lasts a long time anyway so just get the good stuff. The waxy kind. It's so much more comfortable. #2 don't ""snap"" the floss in between your teeth, that hurts and isn't good for your gums. Gently move the floss back and forth to get in between your teeth instead. #3 Make sure you get down into the gums too like between the gum and tooth, not just between two teeth. Trust me, sounds kinda weird but you won't believe the gunk that can come outta there! 

After a week, it shouldn't hurt, and your gums probably won't bleed anymore. It seems like a lot of work at first but if you do it enough, it's like second nature and if you don't do it everyday you will fucking notice. Like my breath will smell worse if I don't floss. My mouth would feel super unclean to me if I were to skip."
Oats are the way to go in my opinion. If you have access to a microwave you can get decent quick oats as well. I add a spoon of peanut butter and it adds a ton of flavor.
"Castles by Tracie Peterson...series of 4 stories, first two go together, third and fourth stand alone."
Will do. I will hopefully get to it tomorrow depending on when I get out of work.

"It's disingenuous to point out one benefit without mentioning the other. 

/point

But you knew that, and neither of us are going to be objective about this. We both have our horse in this race."
"that is irrelevant because Liverpool has leagues too, and just 2 less than you. And no, not winning it in a long time doesn’t change that. How long was United without winning one between the Holy Trinity and Ferguson? 25 years?"
I've actually contacted maybe 20 to 25 article authors and only two have responded and sent me their paper. I don't think this is quite as ubiquitous as this person makes it seem...
"They all suck in their own unique way, also depends on where you’re at, it’s cut up like gang territory."
It makes me sad that they passed us up with this title.

"When I got my 11 Pro Max, I ordered about 15 cases so I could try them all and keep the winner. I ended up with the ESR Kickstand case and love it. The kickstand is so useful and the little hump on the back means I always know which end is up.  I’ve dropped it a few times and never had any damage.

When I got the 12 Pro Max, I went straight for the new ESR kickstand and am still very happy with it."
Depends on what you think best means? I'm with T-Mobile because I can get unlimited talk and text for $25/month with a few gb's of data. I am always by a wifi hotspot and have my music / videos downloaded on my phone in case I'm out without data. That's great for me and my needs.
Was put off by the high school setting of the series for years as well.  Now I consider it one of my all time favorite franchises of any genre.
Seconded!
"> Monoprice is a reliable brand

At least they label the bandwidth of the cable, but why do they omit the amperage? 3A/5A would be helpful to have on the connector too.

They mention the AWG size of the data wires I take it? Not the power wires? 30AWG wouldn't be suitable for 3A or 5A afaik, so if they're reliable then the power wires in the cable would be a smaller AWG size(barely any manufacturer seems to bother mentioning them though).

> needs to be mentioned because while hideously expensive, they certainly fill a market niche.

And what is that? They don't even seem to label the cables, just their logo like many others. What's the premium for?

> *Right Angle, Side Angle Connector, Standard Dual and Single Screw Locking connector available*

For those? You can get connectors for such(though probably pointless for the screw locking type). There's also another vendor with magnetic connectors to swap out the connector plugs, allows you to switch the cable from USB-C on one end to micro USB or USB-A."
