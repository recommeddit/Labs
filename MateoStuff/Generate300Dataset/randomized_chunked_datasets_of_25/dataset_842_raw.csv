"I can’t imagine not putting a Kanye album on the list. Despite whatever political bullshit is going on and the boycotting, hip hop has been evolving rapidly and Kanye has constantly made incredible albums through the times. As much as I love “Ye”, I’m not gonna say that a project that’s been out is a classic, but MBDTF would easily be on there. 

Run The Jewels would have to have an album on here for me. I would struggle between 2 or 3. 

Get Rich or Die Tryin was a major curve in hip hop. That was the first true gangster rap since the 90’s 


I could go on, but you get the point. 
I don’t doubt your authenticity, I just doubt that everyone in this thread believes the answers they’re giving."
"Can’t believe you’re calling Gemini one of Cedar Point’s worst rides. Gemini is my #2 overall and I would sacrifice every ride in that park sans Magnum to keep it. Let the burning of Steel Vengeance commence ;P

...in all seriousness I love love *love* Gemini and I will be devastated when it’s removed"

I been using lowes 10% off but never heard of HD 10% off.  I prefer HD because it's near me and they always have plent of staffs and busier for a reason. While all lowes around here always dead on any given day. I do purchased few big buck stuff whenever there's 10-20 from lowes. And sometimes it's not really off since it's same price eles where after coupon
The editing is a little weird in that. A lot of great stuff but it sometimes seemed out of order to go on tangents.
Yes indeed. Thanks Tech!

"BIG yes to Dior Sauvage and all my girl friends feel the same. There are no words to describe how perfect that cologne is, if I smell it when I’m out there is a 100% chance I’m going to be sniffing my way to the wearer."
"Well, ts might be an issue. It claims to work with any debugger that uses the DBGP protocol and has been tested with PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, Tcl and NodeJS. So I guess it'd depend on the existence of a ts debugger using DBGP. I've only actually used it with PHP, which is all I need at the moment."
"You prefer Wonderoud then?  And yeah they say it's got natural oud oil in there, but I'll be damned if I can smell it at all. Maybe it has like, half a drop per bottle."
Such a crazy moment of reddit history lol

"If you're driving less than 40 miles per day, you can get away with a 120V charger. But, as others have pointed out, a Level 2 charger just plugs into a dryer/stove/RV outlet so it's usually not a big deal.

If you don't plan on road tripping any time soon, then pretty much any EV will work well. The Spark EV is hilariously torquey. The e-Golf is well-polished. The Soul EV is underrated.

If you want to go on the occasional road trip, then things get tricky. If you look hard enough, you can find a Bolt under $20k. The Ioniq's efficiency and charge speed put it on the ""road trippable"" list, too.

For my money, the best EV under $20k would be a 2015 BMW i3 REx for $16k. It might look like the south end of a northbound bulldog, but it's delightfully quick, handles like a mini cooper, and the optional range extender engine can buy you a country getaway or two."
"It’s probably the best program ever. I’m being hyperbolic, but Excel alone is worth the 365 Subscription. It can be as basic or complex as you want it to be."
