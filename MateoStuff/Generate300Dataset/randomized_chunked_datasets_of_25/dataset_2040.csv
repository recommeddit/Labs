41843,"> Not to rain on your parade but 33 has always had an occult meaning. 

well, yeah, thats why i said it was just a cool coincidence. but that was just the start point. 

and just in case it wasn't clear, in no way am i implying that this is anything close to a plagiarism issue. i do suspect they took a few broad stroke ideas from it, but the fact that they then put the song in the show, for no apparent reason because it doesn't even fit, means (at least imo) that theyre not even pretending otherwise. they wanted people to know. 

and as you said, even that video feels influenced by [Malice in Wonderland](https://youtu.be/Lv8IezFbADc?t=36)

which Rick and Morty also [took from](https://youtu.be/TgqiSBxvdws?t=10)

and they seemingly went out of their way to copy it to a degree that you couldnt help but see the connection, as if they wanted no confusion as to where the idea came from",movies like Inception

31006,"> Well, let's start with the obvious: the US. 

I used to think that but I am not sure anymore. I've observed that because of the diversity or something else, people are more reserved and untrusting, comparing to other countries. And they form groups too much, too often, and sometimes too extreme. Also I spot a lack of humanity in the US comparing to a country like UK. It seems people are more materialistic and selfish and more easily influenced by the media and companies in the US.",best country to live in
