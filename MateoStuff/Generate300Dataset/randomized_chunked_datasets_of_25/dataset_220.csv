71492,"Yeah, the second movie does it super well too, the only problem is you know to top the original they have to have a crazy twist so you expect it, the beauty in the first movie is that if you watch it with no knowledge or expectation of what happens, it makes it the ultimate twist. 
Spoilers:
another thing I think that makes it so good is the fact the it comes out of no where, there is no indication of it at all throughout the movie unless you watch it super carefully. For instance when it cuts to the hospital and the cancer patient is the guy in the floor, but the viewer can't know that because of the bloodied face of the guy on the floor.

So yeah, the others do it well but the first is definitely the best.",best movies with a cool twist

My boyfriend argues that Titos is the crappy vodka people get for college house parties that no one actually likes...I keep arguing that he's mixing up Titos with something else cause Titos is respected  as far as I know! Even his friends agree with him (they're all in college) so I just wanna know what if I'm the wrong one here haha.

73374,"The ravpower Batteries have passthrough charging if thatâ€™s something you care about.  I personally do.  Allows me to plug in my power bank and use it as a splitter to charge everything I own at the same time as charging the battery itself.  

The anker powerbanks explicitly do not do this.  Youâ€™re either charging the bank or the devices connected to it but not both simultaneously.  Supposedly this helps with the long term health of the power bank but I donâ€™t really care about having it in pristine condition 5 years from now.  

Iâ€™m also going to suggest the OmniCharge 20c+ since thatâ€™s the one I actually use.  The downside is that itâ€™s hella expensive (~$199.  Got mine on sale for $165.) compared to everything else BUT it has two power delivery enabled USBC ports and also supports passthrough charging.  I can charge my MacBook (and two more devices) at the same time as the power bank is charging and thatâ€™s awesome.",best battery bank

As for superman, I wouldn't say it was brand new, but it was much more improved on from the last couple years. I think the only rough patch was there at the end before the bunny hills.
