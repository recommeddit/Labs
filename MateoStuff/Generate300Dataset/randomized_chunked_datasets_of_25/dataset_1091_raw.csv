"Well I love this sub cause itâ€™s the rare place we can civilly disagree. And I totally get most peopleâ€™s dislike of MCU in general, Iâ€™m just in the bag for these so paying $20 to watch Thor make a hammer and RDJ be covered in a CGI suit is a fun time for me. Totally get itâ€™s not everyoneâ€™s thing."
"Sure and me too.  The subtle power of the loose trilogy of Grass, Raising the Stones and Sideshow, to me, is the larger Fact to Legend to Religion progression of the story as it passes through the books"
Oh my god it sounds heavenly. I'm a sucker for salty sweet anything.

"I just got back from Moon Palace in Cancun. We went for my 26th birthday and it was amazing. The resort has EVERYTHING.. A nice club..great food and also amazing spa to relax. It had a nice arcade as well. If that wasnt enough, we went to the city for a club hopping package with got which was nice. We also went to Xplor park for zip lining. I highly recommend it for anyone in there 20s"
"36 chambers. every single track is an absolute banger, zero filler whatsoever. I think illmatic is a very close second"
Dude who are you arguing with? Obviously college is easier if you're not married and raising kids..
"Shipping up to Boston, Chelsea Dagger, and Unbelievable are three of the most annoying songs ever laid down."
Itâ€™s a weird mix of very progressive on some issues and not so much on others.

"nobody's said it yet but this is a low-calorie way to get extremely drunk:

Picklebacks.   Ok, bear with me. 

Take a shot of bourbon (say, jim beam or something even cheaper) and chase it with a shot of pickle juice.  Vinegar or salt pickles, not sweet ones.  Pickles and pickle juice contain next-to-no calories, and straight whiskey is about as low-cal as it's possible to get while still consuming booze. 

Sounds gross, (and I didn't believe this either, at first) but the pickle juice really neutralizes the bourbon taste/feel.  It washes your whole situation clean, readying you for another shot.  Protip: 3 at a time or fewer!

If you really hate both of those things, it won't work, but if you can tolerate pickles you should find it delightful."
"Jurassic Park was amazing. People hated the sequel. People hated the third one. Then the fourth one comes out and for some reason people are surprised they didn't like it. It's like the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over expecting different results. You go to an island, dinosaurs want to kill you. That's the plot for every movie. And honestly I love the movies, I like that plot, but stop going in to those movies expecting something original or something that makes sense."
"Ellen McLain, the voice of Portal's GLaDOS.  She was really sweet, very chatty, and willing to sign whatever.  I met her at a convention, and no matter what time of the day I met her, he had a big smile on her face, and was never anything but super nice to her mobs of fans.

She is a very classy lady."
White Russians are nice especially if you use powdered creamer. I like them because you have a full serving of vodka and a liqueur as well with no mix.
Weenie Hut Jrs. for me son.
Most likely.

That Mega Blastoise song is cool. The beat sounds like something Vince Staples would rap on
"Cool table,  thanks OP! SA 90s was the only big surprise for me. I would have expected WI or Aus. Also, a little bit Eng 70s but I guess the Windies didn't get their super team until mid 70s"
"One thing to note is there are some places discounting the 5600x to 250, and solid motherboards can be had for around 100$, if you look. So there is a pretty decent price gap. That said, the 12600k is a fair bit more powerful, although neither will realistically limit a 3070 for years"
