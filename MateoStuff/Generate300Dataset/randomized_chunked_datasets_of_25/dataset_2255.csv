39640,best podcast for biologists,"BBC's Inside Science podcast is a fantastic way to keep up with news on any kind of science. It has a bit of a bioscience slant because the host is a geneticist but they branch out to almost any topic, and they've done entire episodes all about physics, or ecology, or even the issue of women in science. Really great podcast and very succinct and well-produced too (which is really important to me).

Edit: All that said, their latest episode where they discussed gain-of-function research was rather awful. Very one-sided and factually inaccurate. I'll still listen, but that was very disappointing."

31827,best hotel to live in,"It is nice - I spent 6 months in a Holiday Inn in the middle of nowhere East Texas with only a mini-fridge and a microwave. It sucked. I love being able to cook meals, have leftovers, bake bread, and the option of just staying in available. This gig is only about 8 hours from my home so I drove up and brought more stuff with me, like cookware and my Xbox."
52015,best iphone case,"I use the Apple Silicone case. While there’s technically some wobble it’s barely noticeable. Not completely flat, but it definitely sits much more flat than not using a case at all."

44312,best items under $100,I'd feel naked without my Leatherman-Wave.
57079,best water brand,"Silence, peasant!"
45386,best gaming system,"Normally, if the port is good, I'll get a multi-platform title on PC. However with the GPU market as it is, I'm buying most games on PS5, because my GTX 970 is wimpy in comparison and, I can't get a new one because of the shortages.

Timed releases are dependent on length of exclusivity and console performance. For instance, I'm not getting MH Rise on Switch because it runs like shit with poor resolution. I'll wait for a PC release."
