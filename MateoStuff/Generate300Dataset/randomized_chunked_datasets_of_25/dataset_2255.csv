39640,"BBC's Inside Science podcast is a fantastic way to keep up with news on any kind of science. It has a bit of a bioscience slant because the host is a geneticist but they branch out to almost any topic, and they've done entire episodes all about physics, or ecology, or even the issue of women in science. Really great podcast and very succinct and well-produced too (which is really important to me).

Edit: All that said, their latest episode where they discussed gain-of-function research was rather awful. Very one-sided and factually inaccurate. I'll still listen, but that was very disappointing.",best podcast for biologists

Timed releases are dependent on length of exclusivity and console performance. For instance, I'm not getting MH Rise on Switch because it runs like shit with poor resolution. I'll wait for a PC release.",best gaming system
