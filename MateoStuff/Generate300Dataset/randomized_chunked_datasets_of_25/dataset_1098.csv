30901,"New York City is great if you make in excess of $80,000 annually (preferably more). 

If not, you're either living in a 400 sq ft, 6-story walk-up that was built in the 1940s (with 2 roommates), or you're living in Deep Bushwick with hipsters.

Either way you're subsiding on rice, beans and halal food because roughly 45% of your monthly income is going to rent. 

On the plus side: Halal Food is delicious. 

Edit: For those that inboxed me, the Chicken and Rice carts in NYC are colloquially known as ""Halal Food"" or ""Halal."" I'm aware of what Halal actually means and that the term itself refers to a certain process when slaughtering the animal.",best country to live in

24588,"Movies included? It's hard for me to compare movies and shows but here are my top 2 shows and top 3 movies:

- Cowboy Bebop - Classic, phenomenal characters, amazing balance of tone, S-tier music...with the exception of Ep21, there isn't a single episode less than great, and at least several (5, 11, 12-13, 20, 22-26, etc.) that are downright masterpieces on their own.
- Gintama - This show basically sidesteps every problem I've ever had with any anime ever. So many of its merits defy logic. It's one of those special works that can make you laugh your head off one moment, then bawl your eyes out 20 minutes later.
- Spirited Away
- Princess Mononoke
- Porco Rosso

Yeah, my top 3 anime movies are all Ghibli. But hey, it's the truth for me. Even the phenomenal Your Name and Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya can't touch these three films in my mind.",best anime
