"I'm honestly very surprised to see Grady Jarrett up so high. Not because he doesn't deserve it, he absolutely does. He's a fantastic player. He just so rarely gets respect from playing on such terrible defenses his whole career."

"It is actually one of the earliest big examples of a plot twist. Before Psycho, people would buy a ticket to the movies and walk in and out however they liked. Hitchcock didn't want to spoil it, though, so he made it so that you could only watch Psycho from the beginning. It is default today but it was a big thing then.

Also, they didn't want people to walk in at the second half and wonder >!where the lead actress is!<."

"I'm sorry, but you must have confused Kareem with someone else. His name was Roger Murdock. He was a co-pilot. Even if it was him, he’d been hearing that crap ever since UCLA! He’d been busting his buns every night! Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes!"
"> when he makes pronouncements about his models and how ""good"" they are

Did you even read *The Signal and the Noise*?  He has an entire chapter dedicated to domains where mathematical modeling has made no progress.  He specifically cites earthquakes as a phenomenon where there are very few instances in the world with lots of noisy data.  He discusses many mathematicians who have tried to predict earthquakes and why every one of them has failed.  I mean the the subtitle of the book is *Why Most Predictions Fail – but Some Don't*.

He also talks about the value of sabermetrics compared to the value of a baseball scout watching players run and deciding who to sign based on that, and concludes that the scouts have really useful information that the sabermetrics people don't.  He states that sometimes the people with domain experience can get more out of little information that the sabermetrics people can with less domain experience and a lot of less important information."

"In my opinion Gen 5 (BW and BW2) are the best games, but it's up to preference. If you're new to the franchise, I'd suggest you play Emerald, then Platinum, then Gen 5. 

Emerald is an oldschool game but still a lovely region and interesting lore and story, plus if you're into that sort of thing it has a great postgame with the battle frontier. ORAS remakes were nice but I think the old graphics etc add to Emeralds charm a lot, I had no problems replaying it recently.

Many people think HGSS are the best games ever but I'm rather critical of them, and if you never played a kanto or johto game before the nostalgia factor for you is 0 which plays a large part in why HGSS are so well liked.

Don't listen to me on this but in my own biased opinion you can basically neglect anything after Gen 5 except maybe ORAS if you liked Emerald. Kalos has been a huge disappointment because the story is lackluster and the regions feels unfinished and empty."
"Eh, there are better PKD books than *Androids*.  This list is also overwhelmingly American, neglecting masters of the genre like Stanislaw Lem, the Strugatsky brothers and John Wyndham.

Overall this list strikes me as incredibly generic, the same books people recommend whenever SF comes up, with only a couple variations.  A few of these would make fine entry points to the genre, but there are way more 'must reads' than these sort of lists would lead you to believe."
Yes! You still can!

"Well, the music school I'm attending (well, I'm graduating this year), would be similar to upper secondary or High School (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Norway).
Since the school gives you both the standard education as well as musical education, students is chosen by grades. However, you can have an audition to get some extra points added to your grades if you're really good...
As far as I know, it depends on the school. If there is usually a lot of applicant, or the standard is really high, they will have an audition.

I chose to go to the audition, but at the time, my main instrument was drums, so my audition was with drums.

If I where you, I'd check with several local (or far away if you want) schools to find out if they have auditions. Usually, auditions would be done by now though, so if you want to apply for next year, you're probably out of luck :P

Next year I'll be attending music technology at University College (according to Wikipedia above), where we also have instrument classes. That school didn't have any auditions at all, only grades."
"> I use Giorgio Armani ""Acqua di Gio"" simply because I can buy it at Macy's for like 50% off with coupons. Call me basic, it's ok. I like it and it's not offensive to people.

Same. It's extremely safe, and at the right time of the year, you can get it on deep discount. I don't love it personally, but it's an easy 'go to' option for a lot of us."

No interest in switching to anything else, and the Arch ecosystem is definitely my home indefinitely."
