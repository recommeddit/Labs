3410,"Its the same as saying you don't need to spend x amount on internet, just stream in 360p, sure you can but majority of users will not watch a low quality stream.

If you can't afford to stream with expensive equipment, there's nothing saying you can't get the minimum and do just fine, but majority of people aren't going to recommend a $20 camera based on the simple fact most people will go with quality vs expense, rather than throwing $20 down the drain for a sub par product, spend the extra and get a product that is known to be fairly priced to today's standards and serves its purpose the best.

With that said, they're getting cheaper by the day and there's nothing stopping you from doing a bit of research and finding there are 720p@60fps cameras out there that cost a lot less than a streamer recommended setup.",best webcamera

:--|:--
Neon Genesis Evangelion | Mech Anime on the surface, but much much more psychologically involved. It is probably the best anime I've ever seen. Be sure to watch the movies after you watch the series, they retell the story in different ways.
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann | Mech anime, sort of. It's pretty much a nonstop hype train from start to finish with some feels sprinkled throughout.
Sword Art Online | Sci-fi online sword combat. Great animation and also decent story for the first half of the season. The story drags a bit during the second half of the first, but picks back up in the second season. 
Samurai Champloo | Action/Comedy great animation and great story. Set in feudal Japan.
Guilty Crown | Sci-fi drama wonderful animation and soundtrack and great story. Some claim it trails weak off at the end, but I disagree. Many feels to be had in this one.
Code Geass | Sci-fi Drama Mecha The mechs take a bit of a back seat from the foreground of the show, which is the amazing story. It's like one big chess game filled with action, surprise, and sadness.",best anime
