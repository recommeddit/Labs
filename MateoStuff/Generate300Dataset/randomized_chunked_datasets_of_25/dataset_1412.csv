Bedside reading lamp. 

Solar powered external phone battery. 

Emergency supply kit -- can be as simple as a MANUAL can opener and canned food, a few 2 liter soda bottles of water, and a crank flashlight/radio.

(Added:. Note that emergency canned food isn't something you buy and put on a shelf -- it's something you regularly eat that you buy a little *more* of, the new stuff goes in the back of the shelf and you eat the older stuff.  Canned tuna, canned beans, canned soup, things you can eat without cooking if the power goes out. )",best items under $100
4856,"I second this. If you actually need to talk to someone who has at least the slightest knowledge about hardware store stuff, Ace is 100x better than big box. At mine they actively greet everyone who enters and ask what they can help with.

332,"Ranger, i'm just really used to the vim-like keybinds and it's really convenient to just have bookmarks or shortcuts to your mostly used folders, you can also assign scripts to keybinds so you can do pretty much everything with the files you selected with other CLI tools like ffmpeg or imagemagick.  

The most common criticism of Ranger it's the speed since it's written in Python, but it really doesn't bother me, i guess it can become annoying if you are using it on folders with thousands of files on a hard drive or something.  

I still have pcmanfm installed as a gui file manager but i barely use it.  

Funnily enough i find the Linux File managers to be more usable than the windows one which didn't even have tabs i think? Maybe that changes with Windows 11.",best terminal file manager reddit
