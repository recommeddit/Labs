Can I get a prince of nothing
"No you dont, just make extended eye contact with a girl while you hold up the box and slowly shake it you also need to maintain the creepy smile . Best contraceptive money can buy"
"Katie Couric: Which Bibles, specifically, have you read?

You: Oh, you know, just all of 'em."
"""My uncle’s a dentist and he told me that 80 percent of the time, it’s not really the toothpaste’s fault. People just don’t brush their teeth properly"""
"An interesting aspect of The Mote In God's Eye, which is easy to miss today, is how the humans use computers and manage information. They all have pocket computers, linked to a massive central network of facts, recordings, etc., and each room has a huge flat screen that they can use to look at shared information. It's basically how information technology works today.

But the book was published in 1974! Before Apple, before Microsoft, before the IBM PC. Niven and Pournelle once said that they considered all the computer stuff to be as fantastical as the idea of making contact with aliens."
"That's good to know! I got the Apple Clear today for my 13 Pro, but forgot to check out the Golden Brown."
"My (22F) go-to's are Whiskey sours, amaretto sours, coke and rum, amaretto and coke (VERY good), bay breeze (pretty sure that's pineapple juice, cranberry juice and Malibu) I recently started getting sprite and Malibu, dirty Shirley's are another good one as well, those are the drinks that I usually get at bars BTW, if I go to restaurants i like to experiment with different margaritas or the mixed drinks they have listed !! Happy birthday!!!!!"
"Of course we are known for negative things in most people's minds, lol"
It's very obvious. The acetate is certainly a higher grade. You can tell this pretty quickly from handling both brands. Of course I'm not commenting on luxottica vs non luxottica but this has been a hilariously misleading comment chain
"And, if you have an Android phone, you can text from your computer!"
Flying would be very cool
I lost my shit when he told Eeyore how nice Tigger was looking today.

"It's dead? I loved that shoe, they make me feel fast."
where would it be placed?
"I love really nice perfumes and have a collection of many luxury scents. My boyfriend makes sweet comments about how much he loves my perfumes and that he wants to get some nice cologne, but he didn't want to spend that much money on one. So, the other day he came with me to Sephora, and I was smelling and testing perfumes. He tested out a Dior cologne, really enjoyed it, but then realized the price. I could tell he really fancied that cologne, so I bought it right then and there for him. 

He tells me every day how much he loves it and all the compliments he gets. It may not be as cool or interesting as other things, but my boyfriend's joy was enough to make my heart happy. 

Edit: The cologne was Dior Sauvage"

"This. And for OP, if you want to have an amp to get the most out of future headphones (of which may or may not need more power), you can consider a few budget options: Schiit Hel, Schiit Fulla 4, iFi Zen DAC (or V2), FiiO K5 Pro, etc. All listed are DAC/AMP singular units, which act as a DAC and AMP all together. Not the best of both worlds but it's a great start and opens up many more headphone options. For gaming, get the Schiit Hel or Schiit Fulla 4 because they have a mic jack.

Disclaimer. I only own the iFi Zen DAC original, and I love it. Gives me plenty of volume with my HiFiMan HE400se (which I find meh for competitive gaming versus my Philips SHP9600)."
"Trust me, this guy is probably the only person to ever gain money from buying a boat."
I'm sure that all the baked-in telemetry makes it slower
"A lot of them have been in the suggestions pile for *years*, constantly ignored. They'd rather implement some new obscure internet data source thing that makes for pretty pictures when they're presenting new features.

Also, Microsoft considers VBA to be dead, and yet they do not have a replacement."
"I also like some of these perfumes, like knows like, haha."
"Over medium egg, bacon or Canadian bacon, slice of American cheese, on and everything bagel or English muffin. Side of hash browns or roasted potatoes. Cup of OJ. Great start to the day!"
"I miss my Mazda MX5.

Why is it so fucking hard for EA to take NFS U2 and just make a revamp with the same mechanics, same upgrade choices, same customization etc, make modern graphics and charge a set price, and not have it packed with MTXs?

I mean seriously, it's fucking ridiculous.

That would be the best selling NFS since Underground 2, almost no doubt, because the original IS just so good."
