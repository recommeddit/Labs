Are you sure that’s what he’s doing...?
Easy Brady.
"I cannot get enough of the views in the Adirondacks. Just be careful of the bears, they destroyed my friends tent when we were there a couple of weekends ago."
"Some of his books I'm not so hot on, but this one is exceptional. I must re-read *Radix* sometime. *Wyvern* is also a beautiful bit of historical fantasy."
"^ + 1, and it often goes on sale on Amazon"
"One that I never really see mentioned is the Crew 2, it gets a bit of flack but it’s actually a really fun open world game. Huge map of the entire USA, and they keep adding more content all the time. Has all sorts of racing from street racing to rally, off road, formula 1, demo derby and even boat racing and planes. I think there’s about 16 disciplines all up. Worth checking out you can probably pick it up pretty cheap on sale. I’ve been playing it on and off since finishing all the achievements in Forza Horizon 4."
"Every year my mom and I exchange books with notes written inside the front cover. We share a love of reading, and one of my favorite things is looking through book stores for a novel I know she will love. She is the reason I am an English teacher."
What's in the middle of Argentina?
"Ha right. Should've mentioned I meant besides Tolkien. So some other quest adventure with diverse locales, fantastical monsters, high adventure."
Joshua vs superpower
"I bought a Snuggie a few weeks ago. I was marching in a Halloween parade and we needed costumes, but it was gonna be like 20 degrees so they said to dress warm, so I just bought a Snuggie and pinned an ""As seen on TV"" sign to me. It's okay. It's as warm as a normal blanket, but stays on very nicely. The main downside is it's nearly impossible to walk in since it's incredibly long and feels like it's about to fall off. Overall, 6/10."
Red Zinfandel or a Salty Dog.
"I am a truck driver and have been all over this Country, and my vote is to go to San Francisco and drive from there to Portland. So much win."
"> kiddo.

That's pretty rude and unnessercery."
"Well, its hard to say its not an interesting concept! Accurate or not, i could see myself enjoying the content. It does look digital only though, which is an issue for me unfortunately. Maybe I'll adapt to the times one day"
Mr Nobody 2009.
"Only sugar free that I can tolerate is Monster Mule. Give it a try!  Aside from that, by far my favourite is Nitro.  The new Assault is OK too if you’re into cola, but it’s not as good as the original.  They’re all 160mg caffeine though, which is more than enough for me."
"The reason I pick Tom Holland is because Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker he wasn’t very good as Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield was a good spider man ( given the script he was given ) but a poor Peter Parker, but Tom Holland is decent at being both giving him the win"
Lmao all those browsers except for Firefox are based on chromium; they won't consume less ram. The only thing you can really do is use ublock origin to block resource-hogging ads and maybe even disable javascript on some sites

"It's chocolate milk for adults. 1 shot of vodka, 2 shots of Kahlua, fill the rest of the glass with ice and milk."
What's this soccer thing?
"I personally think $100-$250, that's a broad range, but I think that's where you get the best value before serious diminishing returns kick in. 

You have some great IEMs from Shure, RHA, etc., some great open cans with the Fidelios, AKG K7s (a lot of them), Sennheisers up to a used 650, etc., and some similarly great closed cans. 

I couldn't personally justify buying any headphones more expensive, but that's just me. I've auditioned the HD800, and it's a great set of headphones, but I don't think it's 7x better than my K7XXs. Same with anything from Audeze."
