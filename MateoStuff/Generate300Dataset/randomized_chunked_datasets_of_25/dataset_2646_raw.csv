"It depends on what my mom is into.  She switches hobbies like some people switch underwear.   This summer, she was really into camping, so, for Mother's Day, I made her a camping kit.  One year she was really into healthy cooking so I got her a grow-your-own herb kit, some cookbooks, and a grocery store gift card.   One year she was into making her own sugar scrubs, so I got her a kit of essential oils and some decorative containers. 

I don't have much money, so I can't do a whole lot, but I think she is really surprised when she gets something pertaining to her new hobby because it shows that I do listen to her."

"Totally agree. What *useful* information does this provide? That there are blobs of great universities on America's east and west coasts? There's a bunch in England? Without at least a list beside it, or some interactivity, or a zoom feature, it's just a bunch of dots."
"I have Mon Paris, love it. I had a rollerball first and I wonder if it’s been reformulated because my bottle is less spicy and more like a body spray.  It used to give me a horrible headache in the beginning and I’m not sure how I got used to it but it doesn’t do it anymore."
