This is the kind of thing failures say to make themselves feel better.
"Dinosaur Island is one of my favorites, and a hit with everyone Iâ€™ve played it with.  You should go back and watch the reviewers that rated it high."
"Yikes you must not be following my team, my player has been top 10 in ____ and ____ every year since 2018 and top 5 in ____ since 2017."
"Not really ""mind-melting"" as far as not being able to understand it but amazing psychological adventures: Memento and The Machinist. Both were on Netflix at one point, hopefully still are."
UsMobile unlimited mobile data with ludicrous speeds on Verizon $55
Sounds really good I might try it

Ublock origin : blocks the normal youtube ad's

Darkreader : can make every page darkmode friendly"
"Goslings 151 is pretty good for 'em too.  That, and sometimes a splash of Boulder Brewery Kinda Blue Beer (hint of blueberry taste goes well with the D&S)."
Robin WilliamsðŸ˜¢ so engaging and generous with his time.
"[Fire It Up - Black Label Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3-Wjmb9PBA&hd=1)

[Motorbreath - Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX2jrWifKak&hd=1) and [The Four Horsemen - Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4nCy5CITc8) and [Hit The Lights - Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKLNj6lgsYw)...  Pretty much almost the entire ""Kill 'em All"" album."

Nas - Illmatic
Joey Bada$$ - B4DA$$

I don't think I would consider these the best rap albums ever, but they are my favorites"
I have seen it while browsing but never payed much attention. I will go check it out!
Yeah Iâ€™m aware of what makes it easy but I also understand that the there are 3 endings that are mandatory for the full story resolution. I mean I find the ideas in the story interesting but I donâ€™t feel like doing everything 3 times either.
"Jeaniene Frostâ€™s Night Huntress series might be my all time favorite series. The first is Halfway to the Grave.

My other favorites are Pamela Clareâ€™s historicals. She has two series set in early America and I adore them. The MacKinnonâ€™s Rangers trio might be the better overall series, but Ride the Fire is my favorite book. When it comes down to it, it might be my favorite book of all time. Itâ€™s lovely and heartbreaking and hopeful and god I can read it over and over."
"There is only one problem that people have with admob.  Everyone thinks that admob is great until it happens to them. [This](https://www.google.com/#bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&fp=cba72ab729d2fd6&q=admob+account+banned&safe=off)  No email, no recourse, no reason given.  Just STU, GTFO, and leave you money at the door.

"As a son, that's what I love to hear. Knowing my dad appreciates me, despite my empty wallet."
"Seconding this question. I'd love to see an ""essentials"" infographic with categories like space opera, cyberpunk, military sci-fi, shit like that.

4chan is a god awful place, but the ""essentials"" charts on /mu/ have pointed me toward a lot of great music."
Nah our games under de boer has been trashh
"well Instagram influencers and youtubers get product sponsorship on their channels, so I wouldn't necessarily trust their opinion.  I have used PL version 2 since feb personally, mostly for procreate with a pencil gen 2, I have had a great experience with it over the normal glass ipad experience.  I haven't had to change my nib either, and I have 2 apple pencil's to compare. (people complain that paperlike wears down nibs like sandpaper...)"
"Toast and Chai on weekdays and Banana French Toast on weekends. If I feel like adulting, Iron-fortified cereal with a cup of Milo and some vitamin-C rich fruit"
"OMG how do you not notice your unleashed dog taking a huge dump and scoot around. 

The owner sounds like quite the self-aware, winner."
"Have you tried Visual Studio Community? Sure, C support goes as far as the C++ demands, but within that set, IntelliSense works, and it's wonderful."
"No it doesnt, not nearly powerful enough. There are vibrators that use a more powerful version of the sonicare tech though"
