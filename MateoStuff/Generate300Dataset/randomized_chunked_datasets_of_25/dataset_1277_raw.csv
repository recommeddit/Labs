"One year I was truly broke so I made her a gift....I  used an old empty can, decorated it with odd bits of ribbon and lace. Then I went to the grocery store and bought paper doilies. On each doilie I wrote a secret about myself or something I have never told her. I folded the doilies to look like flowers so the end result was a rustic-y bouquet.  She pulled a flower out at a time and got to read my secrets. They ranged from confessions ( i was the one who broke the antique radio) to nice ( I always was proud when you came to school because I knew I had the prettiest mom) to funny (I thought babies were born out of your butt when I was little). I added a few special ones that included stuff about my brother who had died when he was 16. I confessed about the time we made fake puke out of salsa and other stuff in the fridge so we could stay home and play Nintendo.  (It worked) . She really loved this gift, I did about 50 doilies so she got to sit there and spend time reading them all, laughing and crying.  She still has them all, keeps them in her China cabinet."

The Dining section has reviews of restaurants in Ithaca? Or does it just make you wish you were in NYC? ;)
mc.. everything else is new age hipster bullcrap..
"The Alamo wasn't a part of the Mexican-American War.  I made the same mistake, wracking by brain for what we had learned about the war, but when I looked it up, I learned the Alamo was part of an different conflict a decade earlier called the Texas Revolution.  My conclusion having now read about the Mexican-American war is that if we learned about it at all, it was just a blurb in a history book that made no impact."
What I find really off-putting about React and Angular is the huge amount of changes that break stuff from year to year. I don't want to have to deal with more shit than I already do.
"I agree with that, but then I'd rather have no measurement than a dodgy measurement. I think that if you can't measure it well you shouldn't include it at all."
"When I take off from work, I travel overseas for vacation.  I love to travel."
one interesting added facet to this movie is that matt damon's character is potentially either gay or was molested as a child (evidently by someone in the church) and impotent as a result. pretty interesting and almost entirely unspoken
Sorry about the butthole thing.  I had been drinking.
"You just solved my ""OMG father's day is next week"" panic attack."
"When Chuck Norris tips, the bill is 20% of the tips."
"I'm not a dentist. 

But I have to wonder, if we get 9 comments in a row of dentists agreeing on one type of toothpaste, does there have to be a 10th that disagrees?"
"He's been on YouTube since 2006. He's pretty much one of the original YouTubers and yet for the past 14 years, his content has been so consistently good, even when he made the shift towards more educational videos.

His stuff with the Technical Difficulties (Reverse Trivia, Citation Needed and Two Of These People Are Lying) is fantastic. If you like British panel shows like QI or Would I Lie To You, I can't recommend them enough. It's entertaining as hell."
Holy fuck that hurt
Got it running and it seems really clean. Is it a cydia replacement or supposed to be upside alongside?

"Watch Iron Man, watch the first Avengers, then you can basically fill in the plot details live as you listen to the podcast and just imagine the same visual language, music, acting, writing, etc from those two.

If you haven't watched Hulk for the Ang Lee series yet watch that as well as it's something different."
"I'm thinking about doing one of their programs. Do you feel that it is worth it, for an online school? Are you able to network at all? If it will help your job prospects at all? 

&#x200B;

I'm nervous about it being taken seriously afterward and being able to get a better job."
"Iâ€™ve been seeing Midea stuff pop up all over the place under many names, even Lennox mini-splits.

It does also seem that quality in the industry in general is at a low. Perhaps as they are rushing to catch up with demand for new equipment?"
Didn't know they had that? Always go for the cheese pizza and crazy bread. I'm a simple guy
So what is the seeding mine is doing then?
