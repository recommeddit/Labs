32674,"Some friends of mine (two different couples) have been to Excellence Resorts in Punta Cana more than once and really seem to love it. One of these couples can afford to go anywhere they please yet they go back to this place often. 

Unfortunately I can't tell you from personal experience how this resort is because my first trip there isn't until December. I used bookit.com and was able to secure 7 days with air from Atlanta and airport transfers for under $1400. Yes, it is a lot of money for sure but unlimited alcohol and non-motorized water sports are also included. Too, bookit.com offers the Bill Me Later payment plan if chunking out that much at once is a consideration.",best vacation resort

26631,"My current top 10 (whatever that’s worth). Have fun with all the lists. In no particular order. All of them are notable providing great experience throughout the years. 

1.	Codenames - A smart word game that’s sweet from 3-8 players in my experience. Vanilla and Pictures are solid. Skip the rest. 
2.	Monikers - Taboo meets Charades with some fun pop and internet references for cards
3.	Kingdomino - A fascinating quick tile placement game. 
4.	Secret Hitler - A great social deduction game for 5-10 players. 
5.	Camel Up - My favorite betting game with fascinating movements. 
6.	Android Netrunner Revised Core Set - This is a great complex 2 player cyber punk game. Lots of variety out of the box and balanced well after years of exploring this ruleset. Will also plug in Star Wars Destiny 2-player Game. Two copies will give some clashes beware the money pit of collecting this game. 
7.	Pandemic Iberia - one of the best versions of pandemic there is (next season 1, but only has a finite number of plays). More open ended options to prevent things and make things. A gorgeous game to look at with great art direction. 
8.	Ra - Has a similar feel to Camel Up but features a nice auction/push your luck mechanism that keeps everyone involved. Egyptian themed.  
9.	Samurai - A slick tile placement game where you capture pieces on the board. Has a japanese theme. Really gorgeous to look at in the end with an uniquely shaped board  
10. Rhino Hero Super Battle - Should add a dexterity game. This one is funny. You build a city of card houses and place small wooden figures on them.  I’ve considered Crokinole but too expensive. Other games I’ve considered is Loopin Louie, Flick Em Up, Junk Art, and the original Rhino Hero, but yeah. Going to go with the latest dexterity game that has my attention right now.",best board games

Take a photo of you checking it into the airport and it going on the checked bag area, with the numbered seal clearly visible and readable on video. The seal will be removed by TSA and you will have video evidence that your item was in fact in the bag when it was taken into the checked bag area.


Huge pain in the ass though.",best suitcase lock
