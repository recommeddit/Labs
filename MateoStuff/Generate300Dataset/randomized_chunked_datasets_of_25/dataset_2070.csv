16490,"Ok, thanks! It's amazing the different technology they have. I have some $20 cheap polarized glasses from Walgreens. My husband has some yellow polarized sunglasses he bought from Academy. I can tell a difference with his lenses and with mine, but I didn't know about the rose or green colored lenses. I only wish I could test lenses outside of the store (such as riding in a car outside) since that would be more accurate for me than testing them inside of a store indoors. However, I will definitely think more about this brand. I think this is the 3rd time I've read of an eye professional praise this brand (on Reddit) and I'm trying to minimize how much I have to squint when outside (to avoid wrinkles), so I really appreciate this advice!",best sunglasses for fashion
