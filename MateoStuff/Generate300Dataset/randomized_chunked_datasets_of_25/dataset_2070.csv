1841,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"If you haven't been to PizzaMan Dan's, don't bother. Absolute garbage."
39773,best Chrome extensions,"I'm pretty sure the ""accept"" button on those disclaimers doesn't do anything other than hide the disclaimer; you continuing to use the site is your acceptance. My guess is this extension just hides the HTML page element that has the disclaimer."
3189,best webcamera,Logitech HD Pro C920.
58486,best cologne,I really like L'Homme by Yves Saint Laurent
31354,best country to live in,"I find those rankings to be too simple as well. You can't just rank ""education"" by ""how good are the students at math and other science subjects""."
2476,best headphones,/r/headphones
24098,best anime,"* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* AnoHana
* Gurren Lagann

53667,best medicine for a cold,DM makes me drowsy but then I sleep like shit
41747,movies like Inception,Irreversible
64270,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"I think there is a site called LibreVox or something like that.   Free audiobooks read by amateurs, so the quality is unpredictable."
66718,best soccer team in the world,Serbia would be much better if their national team management wasn't a complete fucking joke.
676,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"I'll explain how things work. I come on here with 20 years experience in building and repairing computers in my business including all the research I've done. I give the benefit of my experience and put it out there in good faith. If someone (or more) chooses not to believe that, then I or anyone else walks away and you figure out things for yourself. Do you get it now? I would do the same thing to you face to face. I'd smile and walk away waving like I'm doing now. Bye."
13789,best research paper archive,"Watson recently gave a talk at CERN, during which he mentioned a mistake that he and Crick let slip in their paper.  I don't know much about biology, but I believe this was the mistake he mentioned.  You can watch a video of his talk [here](http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1380325).  

**edit:** He mentions the mistake at 37:50."
53261,best usb c charging cable,"Apple’s third-generation 2m USB-C charge cable (rectangular box, not square) is the best in terms of electrical and protocol compliance, but Apple cables have inadequate strain relief because that dilettante Jony Ive prefers pretty to functional."
20243,best workout music,"worlds collide - powerman 5000

Gets me fucking jacked"
51418,best iphone case,"I’ve always used a case because I’m pretty clumsy and butterfingered. But I also always get AppleCare and all this naked phone talk is making me want to try it. Maybe I’d be more careful with the phone with no case. On the other hand, I ordered the Clover silicone case for my Graphite 13 Pro and I love the color combo. Maybe I’ll just go caseless when I’m around the house."
57368,best water brand,Nestle and deer park water
35431,best alcoholic drink,"If you try it, let us know if you enjoy it"
72604,best keyboard switches,"I use Gateron browns, a Cherry MX clone. I enjoy the slight tactile bump they provide. I also enjoyed the quickness and responsiveness of my board with Cherry MX reds. As multiple people have stated, it's all a matter of preference. I suggest heading into an electronics store like Best Buy and play around with their floor samples. Or even get a switch tester."
69084,best science fiction novel,I’m glad to see some Liu Cixin in there. The three body problem trilogy is an awesome work.

58325,best cologne,Pi by Givenchy or Hanae Mori for men. Sweet and masculine at the same time.
55996,best action and adventure movie,Seemed like no one liked it but I thought it was great. I liked the Angeline ones somewhat but they were a little cartoonish even being based on a videogame. Saying that I still liked them.
16490,best sunglasses for fashion,"Ok, thanks! It's amazing the different technology they have. I have some $20 cheap polarized glasses from Walgreens. My husband has some yellow polarized sunglasses he bought from Academy. I can tell a difference with his lenses and with mine, but I didn't know about the rose or green colored lenses. I only wish I could test lenses outside of the store (such as riding in a car outside) since that would be more accurate for me than testing them inside of a store indoors. However, I will definitely think more about this brand. I think this is the 3rd time I've read of an eye professional praise this brand (on Reddit) and I'm trying to minimize how much I have to squint when outside (to avoid wrinkles), so I really appreciate this advice!"
