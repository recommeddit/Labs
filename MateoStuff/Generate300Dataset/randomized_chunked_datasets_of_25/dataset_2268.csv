9688,best dorm hall at UCSB,Just know that rain meant 99% of FT didn't go to classes; granted the rest of the dorms weren't all that much better about attendance during that mystic wet stuff falling from the sky either.
16192,best sunglasses for fashion,"I’ve used sunclouds for beaters (river, hiking, climbing), but they feel *really* cheap (lightweight and flimsy frames) compared to good sunglasses. And the lenses scratch super easily. They certainly have a place, but not what I’d want for a “nice” pair of glasses."
62709,Best Data Science textbook,Depends.  How good are you at mathematical statistics work?  Do you want to do more deep learning?  Are you looking to learn Python?  I can't really give advice unless you say what you know and what you're looking to do.

71210,best movies with a cool twist,Look up the directors of the movies you like and go down the list!
41331,best instrument to play,"So many instruments have their own unique beauty. The [Armenian Duduk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdA1TrlDwAA) produces one of my favourite sounds, though.

70734,best movies with a cool twist,"The Perfection. It's a new Netflix movie and you should go in knowing nothing. Read the log line if you want, but don't watch the trailer."
37451,best amusement park,"The live action pre-show guys would've killed you guys if you had the same crew that I did the one and only time I bothered to go on. They were intentionally hamming it up, repeating ""family"" two or three times for every time the recording said it."

20867,best workout music,I completely agree
