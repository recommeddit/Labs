10126,best pencil for drawing,"Not really. Yes. No.

With only HB pencils, you're going to suffer from a drawing that lacks dark shadows, and highlights are going to be washed out, because HBs put down value too quickly for the upper threshold of highlights.

However, if I was only allowed to have one pencil for a drawing, I'd probably choose an HB. They are pretty flexible."

I am in the mesilla valley around the rio grande. Pecans are a HUGE crop in the valley. You have to wait 15 years for the trees to get to size and shape enough for the production to start. But still that 15 year point they are just cash falling off of trees basically. A low maintenance and lower chemical need crop compared to a lot of nuts."

28675,best breakfast foods,"Two somewhat contradictory answers-

1. Really, I think very few people actually have that for breakfast on a regular basis.  Cereal or toast is more typical.  Full breakfasts are for weekends, hangovers, special occasions etc.

2. UK is the [3rd most obese](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_obe-health-obesity) nation.

Edit: quite a few people are quibbling with this stat.  It was just the first result off google tbh.  Maybe we're not 3rd, maybe we're 4th, or 7th, not really important tbh, the relevant part was Britons are pretty fat already, in the grand scheme of things."
