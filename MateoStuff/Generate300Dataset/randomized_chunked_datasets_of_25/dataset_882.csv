29971,best money managing app,"I just wanted to post the very same question right now, glad I found this

Edit: Recently I tried a handful of these apps, my most important criteria was the same: bank sync

I checked Wallet, Money Manager, Spendee... the best option I found so far is that the latter has a ""lifetime premium"" offer. But frankly I want a free free app with budgeting, just like you."

47429,best state to visit in the United States,"I've been to Nashville, and Myrtle beach. Never have had the chance to go to New Orleans,  but seems like an awesome place.  Thanks for pointing this out tho, I could explore more!"
33400,best electric car,"Of the electric trucks supposedly coming out, gm is the only one I would have any faith to deliver on that promise. 

Rivian has no production experience. They can make a few press vehicles but production is a different matter. Tesla still hasn’t shown off a legal version of the cyber truck. What they did show isn’t street legal under us law. Idk anything about lords town motors."
438,best terminal file manager reddit,"I do most of my file management in the terminal, just cd-ing around. But it I want a visual of what I'm doing or moving a lot of different files around I use Thunar.

I keep Ranger installed, but I can't figure it out well enough to make it more effective than just using the terminal by itself."

Closet and she was like nice this works. Once the kittens came i was sitting next to her just petting one she jumps up gives me a funny kinda meow and as meaningful a look as a cat can give and then bounced for 20 mins lol. 
Turns out she had some food and a clean then nipped out for a toilet break. 
She came back almost checked them all over and went back to feeding them... I felt like a babysitter lol."
51652,best iphone case,I bought a rhinoshield modular case for iphone 11. I had a standard rhinoshield case on my Iphone 7 and dropped that so many times and it still looks brand new and works just fine.
48106,best color to paint with,"Isn't blue really bad for falling asleep? I could be completely wrong (and I'm sure I will be corrected, this is reddit after all), but I thought the colour blue activated histamine along with other things that were responsible for being alert and awake (which is why so many people that use smartphones, laptops, etc. have trouble sleeping, because of the blue lit up screens). Could be wrong, but I feel like blue isn't the best colour for a bedroom."
35840,best alcoholic drink,51% shares right here. The rest are in gold buried under a tree.
16965,best iOS game,"Sunless Sea is fantastic (albeit grindy) it’s got a sequel, sunless skies and it all takes place in the Fallen London universe. If I had an ipad I would absolutely have sunless sea downloaded but I see it more as a pc game and really only for those who know the universe. Was glad to see it on the list though!"
64518,Best Nike running shoes,"I currently have the Structure and I'm not a fan. Anything longer than 5 miles gives me sore knees, though that might just be because I'm a heavier runner, and am flat footed. I usually run in Brooks Adrenaline 15. I'm curious about the lunarglide and Vormero; might be better for me."
