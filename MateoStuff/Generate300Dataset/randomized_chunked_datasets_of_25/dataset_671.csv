59458,best perfume,"This list was tough and to be honest not totally ""accurate"", but this is as close to a top 20 as I could get. I've seperated them into 3 categories.

**The Best Smelling Fragrances In My Collection** ◽**Aventus** is an easy no. 1 because of the smell (one of the best I've ever put my nose on), it's versatility and compliment factor. **Rose 31** would've been no. 1 but it's a shell of it's self since it was reformulated around 2014. Still great though. These aren't perfect, but they're my favorite to smell at the moment.

1. **Aventus** (Creed)

2. **Creation E Parfum Pour Homme** (Roja Parfums)

3. **Straight To Heaven Extreme** (By Kilian) 

4. **Single Malt** (By Kilian)

5. **Rose 31** (Le Labo)

6. **Tuxedo** (Yves Saint Laurent)

**The 2nd Tier** ◽These don't smell as great as the first tier but still amazing scents. Some of these are my most worn fragrances.

7. **Arcana Rosa No. 9** (L'Artisan Parfumeur)

8. **Herod** (Parfums De Marly)

9. **Bleu De Chanel** (Chanel)

10. **The One EDP** (Dolce & Gabbana)

11. **Grey Vetiver EDT or EDP** (Tom Ford)

12. **Royal Oud** (Creed)

13. **Acqua Di Gio Profondo** (Giorgio Armani)

14. **Terre D'Hermes Vetiver Eau Extreme** (Hermes)

15. **Tobacco Vanille** (Tom Ford)

16. **Italian Leather** (Memo Paris)

17. **L'Homme** (Yves Saint Laurent)

18. **At The Barbers** (Replica Maison Martin Margeila)

**Amazing Fragrances I Find Hard To Wear** ◽Awesome fragrances, but I have some difficulty wearing them. I live in a pretty warm climate (New Orleans) so I already have limited opportunity to wear thicker, heavier fragrances, but these 2 are even more limited in that they feel VERY formal (especially **Coromandel**, which is also pretty feminine leaning imo).

19. **Portrait Of A Lady** (Frederic Malle)

20. **Coromandel** (Chanel)"

44800,best items under $100,"It was over $100 but I have to rave about some quality skiing gloves I got. I paid $175 for a pair of hestra gloves and it’s completely changed the game for me. Hands are never cold (I’ve skied with them down to -15), hands are never wet and can grab things incredibly easily. Best purchase I’ve made in a while"
42890,best detective show,I second this.
69972,best major to study in college,"PhD in clinical psychology here. Depends what you want to do with it. There are many fields of psychology and many things you can choose to do (clinical work, assessment, research, teaching, or some combination) but in almost all cases you will need some graduate training. The pros if you go through to the end AND you get a job are that you'll be doing something you love and hopefully working to improve the lives of others. The cons are that jobs are scarce, competition is immense, and for that reason pay is not great. I make 100,000 and that's towards the mid-upper end of the scale for a clinical psychologist. 

Edit. I'll put in a plug for my sub that I decided to create 5 minutes ago, /r/behavioralmedicine. There's nothing there yet, but for those interested in behavioral medicine/health psychology my plan is to grow this thing."
