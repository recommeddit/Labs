"I got the TORRAS Moonclimber clear case for my 12 pro. It’s a fairly standard case with a built in kickstand for viewing videos. I was looking for something that was cheaper than an actual Apple case, able to show off the new pacific blue coloring, able to provide some decent drop protection, and wouldn’t immediately start to turn yellow. Still don’t have the phone yet, but the case feels sturdy with decent construction"
Good strawberry is absolutely delicious.
I love all the colors but couldn't make myself do it and got Apple's black leather case.
"Just keep trying. Change what you're offering, change how you describe it. 

Show up where your clients will be (meet-ups, conferences). Ask for intros when you meet people who know potential clients. 

It's hard to get the ball rolling, but easy to keep the momentum once it starts. 

Good luck!"
"I love Notepad++, but I've had it play funny games with tabs and spaces in python scripts.  

Pretty much got to go with Visual Studio Code for the lighter side of things. I've always got it open for something or other.  And that's coming from someone who pretty much uses emacs as his OS."
"I would advice against buying a backpack made specifically for a laptop. I have found out over the years, that pretty much every backpack nowadays has a separate pocket for something laptop sized anyways. Generally I would say ""non laptop"" backpacks look better and last longer. You can always fit in a sleeve or something if you want to protect your macbook. I don't have too much experience with any backpack that is currently in sale, but I have great experience with Boll, Mammut, Salomon and very good with Deuter.

Anyway, go to a local outdoor outlet and take a look. I'd say most of the time, it's pretty apparent what would make a great backpack. Ideally look for something easily repairable, sturdy, waterproof where it matters..."
"In the US it's called the French and Indian war because from an American history perspective, it was a war where we (British colonials) fought French and 1st Nations people.

I was aware it was one part of a broader global war (7 Years War), but I couldn't tell you a single thing about the 7 Years War.

For reference, I graduated top of my class from one of the biggest high schools in the country, double majored at a top university, graduated in the top 1 or 5% (I can't remember) there, went to graduate school, and have a doctorate. I know fuckall about that war.

That is how little the US prioritizes history beyond our borders: objectively speaking I am top 1% educational outcome for this country and I don't know that. (FWIW none of my degrees were a history degree.)"
I just do it because I use one of those hard/shell bags. The wrap is to keep everything together *in case* the bag breaks.
Now that you mention it... no
"Do you have an idea how to set the file associations in `mc`? The answer ""edit the extension file"" is only giving you the place, not the how.

I can kludge some change in, but everything in there seems connected to other things as well.

For example, I want to change the dependencies to `mplayer` to `mpv`, for audio and video. How can I do this completely? There are also scripts in /usr/ which would need to be changed.

Is this file documented somewhere?"
"Ooh, ooh, now do homeopathy. For people who need to hydrate."
Seltzer water. Specifically Canada Dry. It’s my crack
I'd just wait for the ac+ to come back in stock on lethal gaming gear.

"Out of curiosity how did the Xbox make it into your top 5? It's not because I think it's bad, I own one still and love it. It's just very different from the rest of your list."
Why is it a bad idea?
If you live in south Texas only buy summer socks
I love that channel. I excitedly await the next video.
Great until the plaatic piece broke after 1 year

Lovely work. Definitely better than the ICC ranking system. And looking forward to website.
It's the music that does it for me
