66961,"In my opinion, one of the greatest indications of that teams greatness is the impact it left on world football afterwards. 

FIFA changed the offside rule partially because of how that Milan defense mastered/abused it. 

Guardiola's pressing game was indirectly derived from Sacchi, even Jurgen Klopp gave Sacchi credit for his gegenpressing.

Look at the top level football managers and executives that were involved in the club directly during or after his influence: Capello, Rijkaard, Ancelotti, Boban, Savicevic, Gullit, etc... Everywhere you look in football today you can see Sacchi's disciples.",best soccer team in the world

As most people here have already said, if that's the case I should just get a cat! But we both work 8 hours a day so will make it hard to be there all the time, hence my ""wishlist"" however It seems I might be asking too much. Of course I would take it for walks and stuff, just not very active, especially during winter. I am in a gym and will not go out in the cold.. Summers would be fine. My 3 y/o would keep it running around the house i'm sure.. but again just was hoping I could find a breed that is an easier option that some of the others....",best pet for toddlers
