55495,best action and adventure novel series,"Hey looks like you have a pretty long list already, but i have to add Michael Moorcock's Corum series and Elric of Melniboné series. All high fantasy adventure from the main protagonist viewpoint, swords and magic over politics and intrigue. And there's lots of em, they were written in the 60's through to 80's i think, so there can be a bit of a ""Flash Gordon"" kind of feel. Good entertainment though for sure."

9547,best toothpaste,"It’s hard for me to answer that without being able to see your chart.  If it is primarily decay that you struggle with, fluoride is your best friend.  You can buy a fluoride rinse (store brand is fine), and before you go bed, brush, then floss, then rinse using the fluoride rinse for 30 seconds.  If your teeth aren’t sitting all nice in a row, like picture perfect, it can make it difficult to keep all the little spaces clean... this is when an electric toothbrush can be very helpful.  I hope this helps :)"
