37745,best Marvel movie,Same. I felt 90% the jokes fell flat especially in the first act. I felt the movie gets better after we see Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. Which is sad because Hulk is my favorite Marvel Character. Also why eas his voice so weird in this movie. He sounded Hawaiin

14653,best romantic novel,"I like Jill Shalvis as my easy/comfort read when you want something light (I can imagine these on the Hallmark channel).

Some of my favorites are pear with blue cheese, honey balsamic and cracked-pepper strawberry, and sea salt with caramel ribbons. They also had one this summer that was chevre with marionberry and habanero jam. Mmmmmm."
415,best terminal file manager reddit,"I mostly navigate in terminal using cd and ll (ls -lvh IIRC). Drag and drop files through dragon (with a convenient ddad alias because in arch it is ""dragon-drag-and-drop""). If I need some more power, I use ranger. It's quite handy with a plugin for mounting through udisksctl."

61700,Best RPG game on PS4,"I haven't played it on Switch, but the PS4 is so bad that it just wasn't fun to play as if you jumped from too high when exploring, you'd be punished with ages of loading.

It's the first and only game where I've just stopped playing because it felt like the loading times were a punishment for taking any sort of risk."
