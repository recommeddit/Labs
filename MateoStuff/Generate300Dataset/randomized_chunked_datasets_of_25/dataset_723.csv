13981,"Funny stuff, my tag always sparks curiosity.  Bioactive glass can be a silica-based or borate-based functionalized glass.  Its different from ""window"" glass in that the silica content is reduced to around 50% and much more active components such as sodium oxide and calcium oxide are introduced.  

Bioglasses (BGs) are low silica glasses with the ability to bond to living bone. They can be designed to resorb into the body or maintain bonding with soft or hard tissues in a physiological environment. BG is able to facilitate hydroxyapatite formation through dissolution in a physiological solution; hydroxyapatite is the chief mineral component of bone, having a chemical formula of Ca5(PO4)3OH.
Bioactive glasses have been used successfully in applications involving ossicular prosthesis (middle ear implant) to restore hearing; another application involves endosseous ridge maintenance implant (ERMI) which fills the cavities of extracted teeth to maintain the strength of the jawbone prior to denture fitting, to prevent erosion of bone due to extended use of dentures. Periodontal disease causes gaps surrounding affected teeth, bioglass particulates are used to fill the void and induce natural bone growth. Some bioglass particulates are used in dental fillings too.

32673,"My wife and I honeymooned at an all inclusive resort in October.  Its all a gamble, since it is hurricane season - a friend of mine was evacuated from his honeymoon the week after us in Cancun.

It seemed that it was less likely the Pacific side would experience heavy weather (but still possible) so we stayed at Dreams - Puerto Vallarta and booked through Apple vacations.  This was nearly 10 years ago thought, so there may be better options.  We enjoyed the amenities and the trip was a success.

Good luck!",best vacation resort

27404,"My exact ranking and opinion!

SRK and HR are the only two truly great and versatile actors in this list. Jodha Akbar, Chak de, Koi Mil Gaya and Swadesh have shown their acting prowess. The only two modern actors who are or can be at their level are Ranbir and Ranveer. 

Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar are so unipolar and non versatile. Maybe they have the potential to be great actors and just donâ€™t choose the scripts to prove it. I feel they are happy playing the same role over and over again.

Amir Khan is a very good actor but people often confuse his dedication and hard work for acting skills. Comparing him to HR and SRK is like comparing Leonardo di Capri with Daniel Day Lewis. 

And Salmanâ€¦well is Salman. Probably the luckiest guy in the industry to have cracked the code to be just mediocre enough to pull the most crowd to watch his equally mediocre movies. He is like the Adam Sandler of bollywood movies.",best bollywood actor

They even flew a bottle wine from another property for us (without our asking) because they knew it was a serious favorite from a prior stay. The service level at their properties is stunning. We recently stayed with them in Rwanda and booked for 7 nights.....where people usually only stay 3-4. We just needed a break and knew theyâ€™d treat us well.
