I'm not impressed with Caesar's run in Gaul. He never did defeat that one village.
"Nice. Black is a brilliant fragrance, that completely decimates Patch 24 by Le Labo. Good to know the perfumer also"
I think that the thread count doesn't matter as much as the quality of the cotton the sheet is made of.
I like NFS Heat because you can switch between day/night to do different stuff.

"You realize weekly downloads don't mean shit right?  If you download a repository and somewhere down the chain `axios` is being used but you aren't explicitly using it in your project, it still gets downloaded and the count increases.
Oh shit! Your `node_modules` got fucked some how, you reinstall the project, boom you just increased the count again.
My point is that weekly downloads are skewed as fuck."
"straight whiskey (and most liquors) supposedly doesn't have any net carbs.  While it still contains calories, straight liquor is going to have the lowest overhead in terms of drunkenness vs. fatness. 

So get yourself some decent bourbon and go for it."
Omg young Aamir is the cutest guy I've ever seen

A pair of rings and a pullup bar. Ring moves are the tits.
"I bought it new off amazon, it's used cause acer hasn't resupplied them yet. I literally bought the last one. You can check my recent posts. I posted the same thing last week looking for a monitor. It's a matte screen which I enjoy. 

In game it looks great. I've played red rising 2. Metro series. Apex. Some CS. And halo CE and 2."
"There was one place (Tennessee) where you could jump as a 16 year old. The way they did it, tandem rig manufacturer allowed it, and the tandem instructor was the one who owned the rig, not the dropzone. But that TI moved to Australia (I think) with his rig, so that is no more."
Honestly they have a few. YOu dont know is a banger too
"ME TOO 

Not the homeschool part, but I was barefoot a lot of my childhood. I have size 11 shoes and a big gap between my first and second toe! 

I just wear birkenstocks all the time, even with socks. Fuck fashion."
"Player of Games is where it's at. Banks is under appreciated, don't know if it's just a US thing though?"
Where does one go about acquiring said candy penises?
"Aurora was excellent.  I read it just after, and as a counterpoint to Seveneves."
"Get on Hulu and watch Letterkenny

"Ahhhh fuck. You sir, are pretty good at this."
"Yes, but you need to be prepared for it."
They literally don't lmao
Is there an older model we should look for?
"Besides ft, there is san Miguel, San nicholas, santa rosa, santa cruz, and anacapa. These are all in the same general area. I'm pretty sure that San Miguel and San nicholas have no triples,only doubles and singles while the rest have all three options. 
Last year I was in San Miguel on the scholars floor. Being scholars for didn't make a huge difference as a lot of people were still down to smoke and drink with everyone. I knew everyone on my floor. But San Miguel is not coed floors,  it alternates boy girl by floors. There was still mingling in lounges though and we had the same ra as fourth floor, who also stayed on the 4th floor most of the time and left us alone. San nic is another 8 story tower but it is arranged differently so it has coed floors. 
The other three are all two story coed floors, but there is still a little separation between genders. I heard nothing about santa rosa. Santa Cruz kinda has the chillers rep. And then anacapa. 
One of my friends lived in SC and was in a triple after requesting double. I feel like there are a lot of triples in the 2 story clusters and they also kinda look like swastikas sooooo....
It don't matter
Really I'm not too sure if it makes that big of a difference"
