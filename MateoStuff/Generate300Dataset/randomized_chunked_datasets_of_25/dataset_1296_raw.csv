"I don't drink energy drinks. I hate feeling cracked out and I'm somewhat hyper active as it is, and I always get plenty of sleep so I don't feel like I need them. The one or two times I did try a Monster or Red Bull, I had pretty severe backpain because it was just too hard on my liver and kidneys.

The stuffs bad for you. Get more sleep and eat better."
I GOT A BONE TO PICK
"Oh god yes. I want this. Put this in my mouth. Down my throat. Into my digestive system, so that I may be happy."
Yea I need to invest heavily in her recipes. That corn one sounds great and actually reminds me of a cupcake recipe I came across. Corn meal cake and blue berry. I bet they would be good together.

"Good eye. That is one of the books I read for this. I just got his new book, its the 3rd on my queue."
No way. They totally made scientific observations and measurements of love and sophistication.
Ah yes same here. Recently I got vongos on sale and was running 4 miles in them and felt a hip pain after some runs. I came Here and saw lots of suggestions made a list and went into a running store privately owned by my house. The guy looked at me walk no silly running or feeling and just showed me the neutral selection and gave me space to look and helped others. I hope you are open to the experience and don't feel pressure as I've worked in retail and understanding we all have budgets and responsibilities. Most little shops know you are curious and can alway come back when you're ready. But just finding out it you are neutral or need support is valuable. Best wishes
"Rivian is the exact opposite of utilitarian.  It is designed and marketed for the light truck market. It has a short bed, low load capability, and is marketed toward outdoor sports enthusiasts."
Their wood coaster is stupid fun.  I love it.
"Found it it was on the www.yourepo.com/ 
It’s called noshareshareppl no wonder couldn’t find it with the other name"
"7 ft3: $210 + $25/year in electricity. Assuming 10-year life, that’s $3.83/month. For a 20-year life, that’s $2.96/month.

"My favorite quote... if you watch the outtakes, the actor made it up and everyone else was like wtf because it makes no sense."
I get him fake flowers. He likes them. He died in 2008. Dead people fucking love that shit.
"I too have lived in both. There are many similarities, but if I had to call a difference, Americans are peaches, and Brits are melons. What the fuck does that mean, you ask? OK here are two HUGE generalisations, based on 17 years in the US as an expat.

On first meeting, Americans are super friendly and charming. But you very often never get any deeper than that. "" You will have to come over sometime"" they say, and you know you never will. They are soft on the outside and have a hard centre.

On first meeting, Brits are stand-offish, shy even, almost to the point of rudeness. If you get past that tough leathery skin, there is a soft centre of friendship.

No offence meant either way. YMMV.

thanks! just joined, seems good but yeah the rules does seem a bit strange. Like why the ban on the multiple accounts on an IP address?"
"it’s not exactly contraindicated (meaning you should absolutely not take the two together) but it can increase your risk of serotonin syndrome. it doesn’t happen to everyone who takes the combination and it’s still definitely an interaction to be aware of but i think it’s an important distinction

also to the person who replied about not taking SSRIs with nsaids or antiplatelets: the combination can increase your risk of bleed (especially GI) and again it’s important to know about this interaction but i’d hate for people to get overly freaked out about it “killing your liver enzymes”. you can take the combination and many people do without issue (taking all nsaids and antiplatelets with some food is generally a good idea). if you do take both though you should be educated about what to monitor for (in the case of GI bleeds watching out for things like stomach pains or cramps, vomiting blood or black tarry stools)"
Smoky Mountain National Park is relatively uncrowded in the spring. Too many options there to describe. Buy the trails illustrated map online and pick out a route.
"I've read the article you linked to, and will read the paper later. At the moment, I'm still not convinced that Ioannidis' arguments are applicable to findings that don't primarily rely on statistical tests - as is often the case in biology. If you measure something, and see it, and validate it, what is the probability that it's still incorrect?"
It depends 100% on the physical location.  Some are great some are terrible.  Where I live now it's Lowes.  When I lived 20 miles South it was the local Home Depot.
Tom Brady.  I don't think you can really compare the value a good QB has to a team compared to any singular position.
so many free mods out there for it too
