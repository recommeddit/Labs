yep, this is it. People don't give a fuck about quality until they actually *see* quality. But even then, they're not willing to pay for quality, even if they appreciate the difference.

"Tandems and AFF/coaching are nearly always treated separately by dropzones, so there can be a pretty drastic difference between a dropzone's tandem service and their coaching. If you are focused on AFF and student instruction, I wouldn't use a tandem experience to inform your AFF decision. From my perspective, there are three things to think about for choosing a dropzone for your AFF/A-license progression:

1. Proximity - your A-license is going to take a full day of AFF instruction, 7 AFF jumps, 5 coach jumps, a packing class, and at least 10+ solo jumps to complete (25+ jumps total). This will likely take a month (or two) of weekends to complete. This means that the closer and easier it is to get you to the dropzone, the more likely you are to make this happen in a reasonable time frame.
2. Coaching Quality - every DZ has its own coaching culture and quality. Perris is one of the best in the world, but most of the larger dropzones (Perris, Elsinore, Skydive SD) are pretty good and the coaches will make sure that you are safe and educated.
3. Community and culture - as you start jumping and progress through AFF, your A license, and start jumping with other people after getting your license, you will want  additional coaching, friends to jump with, and more experienced jumpers that will help mentor you. Ideally, you want a group of people that feel similar to you so you can make friends and find groups easily, and each DZ will attract a different type of people and have their own style. Since you will start meeting people in all these categories during your AFF and A license progression, its nice to pick a dropzone that you will go to consistently after you get your license.

Given the above and your location (downtown SD), Perris, Elsinore and Skydive SD would all be good choices. The trade-off is probably driving time vs culture vs reputation. Skydive SD is half the distance, Elsinore has a pretty chill vibe, and Perris has a world-class reputation. Hope this helps!"
"My Dad hated cards until I started buying cards that I would ""vandalize"" into something funny with doodles or writing things like ""UGHHHHHH FEELINGS"" if it was a mushy card."
"Also cooling. Sensors generate heat and high density or larger sensors have to also dissipate the heat generated. Larger sensors mean bigger heatsinks. 

Additionally, most indoor settings are poorly lit. This means more noise from the sensor. The only way to mitigate or minimise its impact is better cooling or more light (which feeds into your comment about lighting and noise). Smaller sensors tend to be denser which increases heat output and leads to higher noise. 

Thin laptop screens are not conducive to good cameras. 

Finally, many people don't have the upload capacity to give good video. My webcam is excellent, but the picture people receive is consistently downgraded by the overzealous compression of Teams, Zoom, or slack which needs to provide 5-15 simultaneous video streams. Not only am I limited by my upload (which like most consumer internet is about 1/5th my download speed), zoom/teams/slack has to process that data and dedicate server bandwidth for my call. Everyone running crisp 1080p would eat up a ton of bandwidth without heavy compression. You can have the best webcam in the world but most meeting programs are going to compress your webcam stream to an absurd level unless you're using something dedicated for streaming where they only have to deal with your video feed."
"The ac+ I have is the coated one. The orange and blue one. Although I like it, it might actually be my favorite non artisan pad, it's definitely not the otsu v2. The otsu v2 has a very different feel and is extremely unique. Honestly the ac+ coated is most similar to the hien IMO."

"When it comes to non e-learning books, myanonamouse, audiobookbay, mobilism, nonvanon are the sites you want to have.  DC++ is the 2nd best place for books on the internet but I guess it's technically not a website.  Also the hub is private and I think rather difficult to get into these days, so maybe it's not worth mentioning.

Funny enough youtube has a decent amount of books.  If someone is new to pirating and you want them to dip their toes, just tell them to search up some of their favorite authors on youtube.  

For example if I type in one of my favorite authors Vaughn Heppner into youtube just about every single audiobook he's ever done is on there.  Takes maybe a month for new releases to get onto youtube."
"I used to when I worked third shift. Now I usually drink them if I have to drive for an extended period of time or have to be up very late and need a clear head. I found that the situations where I felt like I needed an energy boost before are gone because I am eating healthier now, and more active than I used to be. Now I see them more as a mixer than something to keep me awake."

Have you considered getting the [Air58 clone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0843GX2LR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_Wr4mEbG8VNWXY)? I'd love to see a comparison on those two.
