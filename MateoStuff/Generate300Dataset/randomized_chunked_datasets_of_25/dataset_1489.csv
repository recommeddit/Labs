65547,best phone service company,"Not sure why people are down voting you. It's cheap and works really well. You get coverage from Tmo, sprint and US cellular, and there's no roaming - it just works wherever you are. I've been super happy with it."

65062,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"I've gotten so much attitude from people working at French Press in the past, and the worst most overpriced crap I've actually returned it, which I never ever do. My partner used to work at Caje when they were still in Carp, Ryan holds it down as they serve Verve, and the employees are usually nice and make pretty good coffee. We ran into him a while back and he was talking about a new place he was opening, I can't remember the odd name. I'll definitely try Low Pigeon as they are actually roasting their own beans, thank goodness!! SB really should be a world class place for food and drink, but I've always found it meh, people usually have more money than taste unfortunately."

43184,best detective show,"Dark is great and definitely give you the time is a flat circle vibes. 

Fargo is also amazing, particularly season 1 but they're all good. 

As others have said Mindhunter as well. I also highly recommend The Terror even though it's not very similar, just a great thriller"

15868,best sunglasses for fashion,"The glass is not high quality in ray bans. They do use glass in the club masters as opposed to plastic, but the actual quality of the lens is just decent. They also use glass in the aviators, but wayfarers are plastic. I'm not trying to be rude or correct you, I just want OP to get solid information. High quality lenses are more what you see in Maui Jim."

54820,best water filter,"I live in an area with problems with arsenic and chromium in the water supply.  I have a TDS meter that measures total dissolved solids in the water.  I measured tap water, water from a brita/pur type filter attached to the faucet and water from a reverse osmosis unit that goes under the sink.  The tap water had TDS of say 136 ppm or something (I can't remember the exact number), the brita/pur type filter maybe reduced that to something like 133, if at all, and the reverse osmosis unit reduced it to like 10 or something.  That should give you an idea about what each does to things dissolved in the water.  Plus the water tastes great from the reverse osmosis unit!  Pure water tastes amazing.  Throw on a deionizing filter (~$30 and lasts years) after the RO unit and the water tastes even better and the ppm can get down to 1-3ppm.

The brita/pur type are an enormous waste of money in my opinion, they may remove some chlorine and make it taste slightly better, but you are basically wasting $30 every few months.  My parents have wasted hundreds of dollars on those when you can get a reverse osmosis unit from amazon for ~$150 and install it yourself quite easily."
57217,best water brand,"I know some of the brands have flavor packets added to them to add uniformity no matter where the water source was.  


Most bottled water is a massive marketing ploy though.  More and more studies find that tap water, on average, contains less contaminants than the bottled water you get off the shelf.  It comes down to oversight.  There are VERY few people overseeing the bottled water industry, as in like, less than 5 in the U.S.... and it isn't even their main job (don't recall the source on that claim)."
62198,Best RPG game on PS4,The witcher 3 is a masterpiece.
16575,best pet for toddlers,"Don’t get a guinea pig.  They require a shit-ton of work, they have to be housed in pairs, they need a lot of feed which gets expensive, and if something goes wrong with their health you are looking at huge vet bills (worse than dogs or cats).

In fact all small and exotic pets have lots of little idiosyncracies and needs that make them high cost and maintenance.  I’d probably wait for the move and get a dog."

\*\*I want to say the Commonwealth Duology as one, because the follow-up novel, Judas Unchained, is a direct continuation and I consider the two books as one volume.

\*\*\*And really, the whole Takeshi Kovacs trilogy is good.

\*\*\*\* Post-apocalypse counts, right?

\*\*\*\*\*Honestly it's getting a little crowded around the 10 spot, tons of books vying for a spot. The Martian, Seveneves, Glasshouse, Watchmen (if you count it), Flowers for Algernon, Contact, Starship Troopers... so many good sci-fi books."

58695,best cologne,It's not a problem to me I'm usually 1 maybe 2 sprays. I have sprayed more and it is more. It's certainly a pleasant scent and I don't think it would choke people out.
57113,best water brand,"I live near a sketchy area to drink from the tap. Virtually everyone in my larger city buys bottled water. I used to live in the Midwest, however. On a farm. And we had our own well. Trust me, if I could safely drink from the tap, I would."
