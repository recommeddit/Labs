41995,"I viewed the movie in exactly the same way!
 
Very impressed with the story and special effects; I loved the overall concept and I was shocked to see a low IMDB score. The trailer showed a bit too much and I understand if people mistook this movie as something else.
 
This also reminds me of two other films where the trailers try their damnedest to ruin the movie:
 
[Midnight Special, 2016](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2649554)
 
[Captive State, 2019](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968394/)",movies like Inception

One episode where at least 1 of 4 superpowered ppl are infected with a mind control parasite after a mission and everyone seems shady. Another episode a number of agents are replaced with androids with perfect memories with intent on replacing other key ppl, this one gets dark when one character essentially murders her boyfriend when she figures out he's a robot.",best detective show

64691,"I run with the 3.0 v5 and it is definitely light and amazingly flexible. While it has a great ground feel vs any traditional shoe, it's still quite different from a Vibram, though mostly they are different in the direction of remaining amazingly comfortable with light cusioning while still seeming like there is no shoe there. You'll still really need to run with a forefoot strike in these shoes though as the light cushioning is the same throughout the foot and not really enough to heel strike with.",Best Nike running shoes
