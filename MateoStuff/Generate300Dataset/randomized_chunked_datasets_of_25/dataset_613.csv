60167,best freezer brand,I found [this](https://consumersane.com/most-reliable-refrigerator-brand/) in another thread that helped a lot. I’m probably going to get a whirlpool. There’s a factory only an hour or so from me where they make these so I’ll bet they’re the best option for you too.

44672,best items under $100,I grew up wearing pads. I once tried using tampon but can never get it in there. Is menstrual cup better you think?
22754,best celebrity,"Cool Ali story from the 1980's: My Dad has been a huge Ali fan since his early days. One time in the '84 or '85, Dad was on a plane flight with my older sister (who was a newborn). He hears someone say ""You have a beautiful baby girl"" from the aisle. Lo and behold it's Muhammad Ali. Apparently Ali asked to hold her and kissed her forehead."

41995,movies like Inception,"I viewed the movie in exactly the same way!
 
Very impressed with the story and special effects; I loved the overall concept and I was shocked to see a low IMDB score. The trailer showed a bit too much and I understand if people mistook this movie as something else.
 
This also reminds me of two other films where the trailers try their damnedest to ruin the movie:
 
[Midnight Special, 2016](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2649554)
 
[Captive State, 2019](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968394/)"
43109,best detective show,"There's a couple of episodes of Agents of Shield that come to mind. One episode where at least 1 of 4 superpowered ppl are infected with a mind control parasite after a mission and everyone seems shady. Another episode a number of agents are replaced with androids with perfect memories with intent on replacing other key ppl, this one gets dark when one character essentially murders her boyfriend when she figures out he's a robot."
23254,best car racing video game,"Forgot about dirt, that's a good series.

Super fun."
71862,best movies with a cool twist,Two hours of non-stop bated breath and clammy palms. I absolutely love it but holy hell is it mercilessly intense.
67428,axios alternatives reddit,"I was really surprised that it actually does - maybe it's not elegant. 

This was the main Use Case that prompted me to write this. I was also convinced it couldn't be done because of the Promise-based design.

Here's a direct link to the section: https://danlevy.net/you-may-not-need-axios/#download-progress-helper"

25642,best cricket teams of all time,I will make sure to include a colourblind friendly option next time :)
24559,best anime,Indeed. That might be a good way to put it.
64691,Best Nike running shoes,"I run with the 3.0 v5 and it is definitely light and amazingly flexible. While it has a great ground feel vs any traditional shoe, it's still quite different from a Vibram, though mostly they are different in the direction of remaining amazingly comfortable with light cusioning while still seeming like there is no shoe there. You'll still really need to run with a forefoot strike in these shoes though as the light cushioning is the same throughout the foot and not really enough to heel strike with."
71352,best movies with a cool twist,In the original ending they were going to find the grail at Harrods.
57112,best water brand,I never thought a question about water could make me so angry
10092,best pencil for drawing,"It's whatever you're trying to get out of it. For me the brand doesnt matter, it's the hard/softness of it. I always seem to need an HB, 2B, 6B and I love my 9B I found. 

Also graphite sticks are awesome."
15192,best tree for the garden,Sure they may need some pruning but I still think they are better than some of the other suggestions.
3697,best college for research,"Yeah of course I'm including grandes écoles when I say ""universities""."
71409,best movies with a cool twist,"Dead Man's Shoes - man returns from military to childhood home and wreaks havoc on small group of friends who treated his brother poorly, all the while talking to his brother about what he's doing. 

*Spoiler Alert*

Final scene depicts flashbacks of friendship group torturing and murdering the brother. You slowly realise you never see the brother in any scenes other than in isolation with main character. Dead the whole time."
64611,Best Nike running shoes,Interesting. I’ll probably have to switch at some point but I really want to try the endorphins
