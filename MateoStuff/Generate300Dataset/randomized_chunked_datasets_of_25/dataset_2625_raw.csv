Surprised this took this long.
"Hi, sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I'd say go for the Legion 5 15"" between the two."
Shawshank Redemption?
"10th. Mediocre team. Mediocre trainer. And it's not Inter, sooooooh..."
"I don't know if they were already added but...

1. CallMeKevin - a gamer and overall cool guy. 
2. JaidenAnimations - just like the name says, an animator who tells stories about her life. she's a great storyteller :)"
"Fun fact: The guy who played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network is named Armand Hammer. Real name. Comes from a long line of Armand Hammers, the first of which was actually named after the American Socialist Labor party's arm and hammer symbol."
I felt like I wasted my time watching making a Murder even though it was good. They twisted a lot of information to fit their story.
"Careful with the CSS chargers.   
There are not more CCS chargers, there are more locations.
They are not optimally spaced across the country.
They speed of CCS varies greatly.
They are often broken.
Integration into the car is non existent.
Payment integration is clunky.

The other cars he mentioned max at like 50-75kw so long charging times even if he finds a working ccs station.

Edit:  there are people that live 500ft from a tesla dealer.   Also no one owns a Mach e yet so we don’t know any real world numbers."
Sons of Anarchy
Confused Lingard doesn’t play for any of these teams
"Bunny? Ferret, other small pet? Or just a small dog?"
"I'm not a religious man, but my Father is. So I'm getting him a Saint Joseph medallion for him to wear. He's the patron saint of fathers and carpenters, my Dad's profession. So if your father is a Christian, a medallion can be bought for around $20 online and can be a very meaningful gift."
"I'm currently getting my master's degree through the distance learning program at a state university. As many have already said, getting a degree through a program like this at an actual university is almost the exact same as getting the degree on-campus. The main difference is what attracts most people to online education: you get to do everything when it's convenient for you (while still observing due dates for assignments, obviously).

I actually completed the majority of my bachelor's degree requirements online (for my major, not just core classes), and no one's questioned the legitimacy of my degree. The application process for my current program was actually more rigorous than for the on-campus programs (at other schools) that I applied to - you can tell they take it just as seriously.

tl;dr pretty well so far"
"!!!! This is great to know! I love her music. That's awesome, I'm very jealous of you."
"It ought to have condensed milk, too."

"Obviously fuck Nestle. Dasani tastes metallic.

But my honorable mention goes to Fiji water. It has this really odd aftertaste that I can't really pinpoint. Plastic maybe?"
Chocolate liker.
"From most accounts WoT falls victim to some really boring, meandering entries later in the series..  I've read most of Sanderson's output and can tell you that it's all top notch stuff... I have every bit of faith in him to write 10 fantastic books (or tomes, TWoK is enormous)."
"This is exactly right. The library/journal association stuff is just correlation, but this is the group that originally used the R1 label."
"Breakfast burritos, end of discussion"

"I'm just too tired for such a conversation. Use whatever you like, but even if Firefox behaved this was on my computer, I'd still avoid using Chrome; my privacy is more important than a few GB of RAM. 

Firefox is using about 5GB of RAM on my computer in this moment, but I keep about 10-15 tabs open, which are incredibly heavy on RAM, CPU and GPU (TradingView and other charts, Youtube, Whatsapp etc.) 

I've had both Chrome and FF in the past, they used about the same amount of RAM and CPU, but Chrome lagged a bit. It was usable, but not good enough. And this was before Firefox Quantum and the latest updates that have made it lighter and faster on most computers. 

Take care."
