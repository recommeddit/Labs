57398,best water brand,"Bottled water is all terrible.  If you live in a place where tap water is safe, get a filter for your hone and fill  your own reusable bottles.  

Most bottle water is just filtered tap water anyway. Single use plastic bottles are a terrible waste and trucking all that heavy water all over just makes it worse.  

If your tap water sucks, at least use those big refillable 5 gallon jugs."

35312,best alcoholic drink,"> Long Island

It really depends on who's making the drink. I've had some long islands that are great! Then again, there are some bartenders that put too much sweet n' sour mix, which can make it taste like lemonade. I work in a restaurant and am friends with the bartender, so all of my Long Islands bear a wonderful resemblance to gasoline."
33821,best Pokemon game,"The **Best** Pokemon Game for me is Heart Gold/Soul Silver.  
I personally feel they encapsulate all of the best aspects of the Pokemon series.  
\- Great spritework.  
\- Retelling of the Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal story, which was great.  
\- A wide variety of Pokemon available to you to use (Gen I - IV), where plenty of them are just straight up available ingame, requiring fairly minimal transferring to complete the National Dex.  
\- Following Pokemon.  
\- Excellent endgame (the entire Kanto region).  
\- Gym Leader rematches.  
\- Uses the Gen IV improved Physical/Special Split, which really makes Pokemon battles make sense.  
Really the only letdown in Heart Gold/Soul Silver is that the games still suffer from the Johto difficulty curve. It has been improved for the later game, where a lot of the Kanto Gym Leaders have been improved, but it still could be a little more balanced away from the Players favor.

The **Worst** Pokemon game is easily Sun and Moon.  
They are redundant games that were clearly rushed.  
\- The Totem Pokemon are dumb and boring.  
\- Z-Moves are nothing special, and are a significant step down from Mega Evolution.  
\- The games are *SO* easy.  
\- There is *way* to much handholding in every area, though it is particularly bad on the first island.  
\- The linearity throughout the islands is ridiculous.  
\- The story is retold, and retold better in the Ultra games, making the originals looks like a big waste of time and effort.

I'll honorable mention Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire for best games, since;   
\- they basically perfect Hoenn's adventure.   
\- they handle Mega Evolution relatively well.  
\- they look great.  
\- the PSS was a solid feature that was perfected by them.  
\- the Delta Episode was cool af.  
I just can't put them at the top since I still feel Heart Gold/Soul Silver just do everything (except maybe the PvP) just a *little bit* better."
15365,best tree for the garden,"Coastal redwoods, cypress, Lebanese cedar"
12386,best gifts for mom,"Same thing, mom loved this one perfume that was too expensive for her to consider buying every time she was out but was totally priced within reason to expect from a gift for a family member, so she pretty much requested that from me every year and loved it."
3031,best webcamera,No most twitch streamers just use the logitech c920...I promise you xQc does not use nor know how to use a DSLR camera set up.
8448,best toothpaste,"Have a good friend dentist, and his answer to this is the one you will use that has fluoride and no polishing beads,"
27201,best board games,This is really interesting. Obviously reviewers have their own tastes (I should know) but seeing so many reviewers aggregated does paint an interesting picture. This just further cements I need to play Feast for Odin
66298,best soccer team in the world,"*only one European trophy, cup winners cup, like us"
37237,best amusement park,"I hope not as well. Dorney was the park I went to as a kid all the time. To be fair, it can't compete anymore but easily could have if they added more rides"
30821,best country to live in,"Fuck yeah it's clean. I made friends with a Swiss foreign exchange student, and she said her biggest surprise about America is how dirty it was. 

She said that in Zurich the streets are actually washed. I *think* she was joking?"

8982,best toothpaste,Isn't Novamin the important ingredient to look for in toothpaste?
9229,best toothpaste,"Fair, but I am a dentist. I worked in clinical trials and Colgate did a bunch of research on how different toothpastes worked. So theyâ€™re spending the time and money to develop new products, I use Colgate because of that. Also, I make enough fixing teeth. Not trying to get in trouble for toothpaste kickbacks."
54342,best medicine for a cold,"A cold is a virus. I'll start with what needs to be said, antibiotics don't fight a cold. 

Drink a lot of water. Get rest. Take a hot shower. Eat hot soup and crackers, drink hot tea with honey. 

In short, a virus will be killed by your body's reaction (someone insert science here). Think of it like a surprise attack, you have to battle it to kill it. The best thing is to be prepared: eat right, wash your hands, get your flu shot."
72386,best keyboard switches,"This is really the only way to answer the question without opening a door to the pitchfork emporium. There is also the point of spring swapping, living, or otherwise modifying the switches to get a different feel.


Edit: lubing, not living."
14563,best romantic novel,Shelter in Place by Nora Roberts has a sculptor heroine.
38570,best newspapers to read,people who are scared of technology. As soon as they die off the paper will die
70310,best major to study in college,I study philosophy and am starting Law School this fall. I sort of wound up there as an accident. However now that I'm graduating I wish I studied something I actually liked- I've always really enjoyed my ECON courses and Political Science courses ðŸ¥¸ so one of those with the same career goal at least that I have now ðŸ˜Œ
71497,best movies with a cool twist,"No one watches the prestige twice. You watch it once, or you watch it every other month because it's one of your favorite movies"
16404,best sunglasses for fashion,"Itâ€™s not so much the quality decrease as the market position. They already had the history. In the old days, there werenâ€™t many options and there were literally what you could get at the store. Probably a big reason their styles are so accepted. Now Lux has taken that historical grounding and boosted it exponentially with sheer marketing prowess. So for 90% of people, it is a comfortable choice, and just what they think of when theyâ€™re sunglass shopping. Iâ€™ve seen it happen at the shops. Nearly every casual user walks straight to the Ray Bans, not even stopping to check the Maui Jimâ€™s or Vuarnets or more obscure options."
44566,best items under $100,"I put a motion sensing light switch in my garage. My beer fridge is in the garage and it's just wonderful not to have to search for the light switch when going out for a third or fourth. Ontop of that, the lights turn on when I pull the car in which is great at night. I often go in and out of the garage with full hands so having it just turn on when I enter is just wonderful. It's honestly the best thing I've done for my house."
6276,best Netflix documentary,Hitlerâ€™s circle of evil. Loved every minute of it.
