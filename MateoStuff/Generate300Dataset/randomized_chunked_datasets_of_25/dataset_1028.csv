53587,best medicine for a cold,"These people are the worst. “Look at how dedicated I am” “no, dear. Look at how inconsiderate you are”."
32419,best vacation resort,"I'm a huge fan of Amanyara in Turks and Caicos. In general, the resorts in the Caribbean that do a lot of advertising and have 'deals', I avoid. They're geared for the average Canadian or American couple, looking for a warm escape on a honeymoon that tend to be easily impressed (often couples with limited travel experience who think being brought a cocktail on the beach is an impressive luxury rather than a basic expectation for a luxury hotel). The lesser-known resorts (Amanyara, Amanera, Jade Mountain, Cotton House, MO Canouan, Rosewood Mayakoba, Petit St. Vincent, etc.) are much more luxurious, and I can recommend them all. The *only* one I would steer away from for this trip is Jade Mountain, as it is more couples-focused.

The other option is AirBnB Luxe. You can get a large house on the beach, sometimes with a private chef, and you'll have more space than at a resort (but sacrificing soft product luxury)."

11410,best gifts for dad,"That's why I always make my own cards. Whether it contains humor or feels, it came from the heart, not from a shelf.

And it's unique!"
3973,best online college,"You're welcome :) Us online learners need to support each other.  I don't know how much help I can be, but if you need help with anything send me a PM.  I'm somewhat resourceful."
43299,best ad service for mobile applications,"Yeah I’m super on the fence about going with a smaller / more unknown platform unless you really know what you are doing. In my experience most of what I have learned has come from talking to people within the community so the more you work with a partner that other app pubs or networks don’t have as much experience with you end up limiting yourself when dealing with an issue. 

Ultimately I worry that you would be limiting yourself from maximizing on revenue

But that’s my opinion so take it for what it’s worth"

47784,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Others have said it, but make sure you can even have a calculator. I’m at the University of Illinois right now and they don’t allow calculators of any kind, even basic four-function ones. You are expected to be able to do arithmetic in your head or by writing it out. The math department considers the use of any kind of calculator whether in class, or at home (including online ones like desmos, symbolab, or Wolfram) to be cheating.

Honestly, my advice is to ask yourself if you really need a calculator — and if you do, are you ready to even take calculus?"

64768,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"This is a great list! Only commenting to second two of these suggestions:

1. Toma - SO GOOOOD. My favorite restaurant in town! (Edit: Pretty sure you can eat at the bar at Toma)
2. The trip tip sandwiches on Sundays at Cold Springs (up highway 154) are delicious and the vibe is awesome - biker bar in the mountains with live music around 2 or 3"

66083,best college in california,"I didn't list any junior colleges. There are 112 of them, but currently [only three reddits for junior colleges in California](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/california#Juniorcolleges). 

On the other hand, there is nothing from stopping you from creating one. Would you be interested in being a mod for a reddit for Diablo Valley College?"

72790,best wireless lightweight mouse,"Viper ultimate, do what you can to get it."
54367,best medicine for a cold,"Drink an entire bottle of Robitussin DM. If you can handle it, your cold will be gone in the morning.  However, most people have a bad reaction to that high of a dose of DXM, so if you can get your hands on any cold medicine with actual pseudoephedrine, it will make you feel a lot better. Usually you need a prescription. If you live in Alabama, you can get a box of Advil Cold and Sinus with your state ID."
38170,best Marvel movie,"Yeah, it's definitely the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel and I'm shocked the people in this thread are arguing otherwise (but I'm enjoying the argument and human contact albeit virtual... Wow, quarantine is rough.)"
