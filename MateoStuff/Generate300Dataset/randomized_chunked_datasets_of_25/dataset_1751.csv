30885,best country to live in,We specialise in moaning about our country. Get ready
8854,best toothpaste,Well combine that with the above post about how whitening agents in toothpaste are abrasive and damage enamel and that's a pretty decent reason to avoid those pastes.
37538,best amusement park,"It depends what you're looking for. If you want a whole bunch of great roller coasters, then Hersheypark is for you. However, if you want a throwback in time to an amusement park that is truly like no other, then Knoebels is for you."
32880,best free online grammar checker,"I am my own grammar checker. I'm very good at it. I have studied Reed Kellog Diagrams and Sentence Trees, and am pretty damn good at constructing them and using them to analyze complex sentences if need be. I also have a copy of a style manual and a copy of Bryon's *Modern American Usage* for when I need to look something up. For spelling, I type the word into google and let it correct me, then look at the definition to see if it corrected me correctly.

If you are at all good at grammar, there is no need to pay anyone anything. You just need to use due diligence and stay focused when editing your piece."
62650,Best RPG game on PS4,"It's so good man. I know that most people say that the Genesis version is superior, but outside of the improved Matrix, the storytelling is nowhere near as solid. Also, the SNES version is actually canon and was based on a book from the Shadowrun series called ""*Never Deal with a Dragon""* by Robert Charrette. 

I actually own that first-edition book. Although it's not about Jake Armitage, it gives you a glimpse of what Drake was up to before the events of the game and really fleshes out that world. Iconic cyberpunk before that word became associated with disappointment, lol."

70178,best major to study in college,"As a software engineering student, electrical engineering being there but software not is a joke based on everything I've read."
22494,best celebrity,"I love how OP asked for celebrities who are either assholes or nice... and most stories are about awesome celebs. 

I’m genuinely surprised."

51304,best iphone case,Ordered the Wisteria Apple leather case for my Sierra Blue 13 Pro. [Case arrived on Thursday and I love it. ](https://imgur.com/a/cRzI3zs)
18424,best YouTube video,I'll just link it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShUeudtaFg
41779,movies like Inception,"> Shutter Island

that movie is almost 10 years old now and people on /r/movies still routinely criticize it because they didnt like the twist, because it was too easy to figure out, even though they dont actually seem to know what the twist is

spoiler: [its not that DiCaprio is really a patient and not a cop, he's fully aware of that too. the twist is the very last line of the movie, its the final 10 seconds that changes everything. he wants the lobotomy to forget, because the pain of what his wife did is too much to live with, and he simply wants that to end](/spoiler)"
13172,best gifts for mom,"Set up a date for her friend and her to get out for some dinner, drinks, movie, whatever.  Give her like 3 or 4 hours of carefree time away from you, the house and the kid.

Send her out, take care of the kid for a few hours and text her that everything is great(even if it's a friggin' mess).

Maybe try it a couple times because she might be so worried about the kid the first time she's away from the house, it may be a bit of a buzz-kill.  After she's gone out a couple times and is more comfortable, get a babysitter and take her out on a nice date(but be careful, this is when lots of second kids happen ;-))."
52303,best hiphop album,"And I wasn't even hating on the entire subgenre. Death Row had some dope releases (The Chronic, Doggystyle, All Eyez...) plus I dig DJ Quik's work. But the whole thing became a cheap gimmick and a damn parody of itself with that W-throwing, over-the-top misogyny, khaki suits, 64s, and them tired ass whistle beats.

Be honest with me. Outside of Pac, who did the really have that was a credible contender for the throne against the likes of Biggie, Nas, Jay, Prodigy, Wu-Tang, Big L, Rakim, AZ, Jeru, Redman, and Boot Camp? 

Snoop who fell off hard after Doggystyle? Mack 10's wack ass? Jayo Felony? Daz? Tray Dee? Fucking E-40?"
21426,best workout music,They've got this slight level of cheese that I absolutely love. I don't really know how else to explain the feeling I get from them

13142,best gifts for mom,"Robe, jammies, comfy slippers, good soap, lotion and cologne spray from Bath and Body Works, earrings, bracelet, necklace, soft scarf, gloves and hat, a good book, a good puzzle, her favorite coffee or tea, pretty kitchen towels and hot pads to match, satin pillow cases, etc... I am a 50+mom and I would love any or all of these! Also, Ethyl M chocolates shipped from Vegas. The lemon cremes covered in dark chocolate are just ridiculously yummy. You can find Ethyl on the web. They really are to die for."

5965,best programming language for web development,"Ruby on Rails
JavaScript/Typescript
Web components (Polymer/Vue.js)
Serverless (AWS - API Gateway/Lambda)

Also take a look at VSCode or Atom, excellent editors too."
33409,best electric car,And yet here we are with the Tacoma. I honestly don’t get it. I had a Tundra but that love didn’t last. Partly because of me driving it into a river. But still.
14096,best place to get free books,It's one of those things where it's illegal but nobody is going to care. Book companies don't go balls out like movie producers.
43578,best items under $100,"Im not going to lie, when I was installing it that thought also went through my head haha, I dont have many points so I would be banking on that lol"
73145,best Linux distro,Any that comes with KDE Plasma desktop environment (interface) like Kubuntu / KDE Neon / Manjaro KDE.
73800,best matte screen protector for ipad,"If you’re writing on it a lot, I definitely vote matte. My favorite matte screen protector is the Bersem Paperfeel because it has a very rough texture. It feels great to write on in my opinion. However, other people may prefer a less gritty texture in which case try the iCarez (the knockoff equivalent of the Paperlike)"
