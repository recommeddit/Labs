"G7 is simply better, it is a bit faster (not really important though) and doesn't have any IPS or VA short comings."
"My wife and I went to Sandals in Montego Bay, Jamaica- All inclusive resort and it ran us right around $5,000 including flights. It was the best experience we had ever had. The resort was beautiful and had plenty of variety in food and activities. The people were incredibly friendly and maintained the grounds beautifully. We plan to go back on our 5 year anniversary. I would highly recommend it!"
"Verizon has really good loyalty bonuses

They reduce your monthly payment by $5 after you stay with them 3 mo, and then another $5 after 9 mo.

I have a $40 plan and pay $25, another $5 being deducted necause I have autopay"
I go to both.  Lowes has some things that I prefer while Home Depot has some other things I prefer.
"I always tell people, get me experiences, not stuff. Arrange a camping trip, super fun. Plan a sweet ass pub crawl. Invite me over to dinner and music at your place. 

I'm an adult and buy the things I want/need. If i don't have it but want it then it is almost certainly out of your price range,which is why I haven't purchased it yet. My tastes are specific, so even if you do think... I'll get him this tool/gadget/item, chances are I won't use it because I want the other one, the one that was twice as expensive as the one you got, the one that was on the shelf next to the one you bought but didn't want to spend the money on, the one that has the eclectic feature that I'll never use but must have.

If you absolutely must get something, and cash is not your thing make a donation in my name to charity, seriously I don't need more stuff."

"I have Beyerdynamic DT770s. They cost me a fortune (275 USD) when I bought them in 2012, which was about a week's wages. I bought the warranty for them, but regret none of it. They have lasted six years so far and have gone strong since. I will buy another pair without so much as a second thought the moment these fail. They are certainly not bass bumpers though, but the frequency response is stupidly high, and i can regularly hear tape hiss from CDs that were pressed in the 80s, which were basically analog to digital conversions. Excellent reproduction."
I never used Dolphin for something that requires elevated privileges.

Do you know any other websites that are more directed towards textbooks? I donâ€™t want to be paying 250/book when i go to college
"Similar predicament:

(As a buyer) Why should I trust a realtor to fight for a better price, when their commission is based on the final sale price?

(Yes, I am aware that buyers agents are a thing)"
"Yes and no. It's dependent on the game and your settings. 

Example:

Yes -  League of Legends maxed settings

No - Witcher 3 maxed setting"
"I was on a Southwest Airplane late at night coming out of ABQ to LAX. This big guy ignored the entire empty plane, sat next to me (F, blond) and started chatting away. I figured he was a contractor or something of the kind. We had a grand time until people started to come to our row asking for his autograph. Confused I asked him who he was and what he did? He said his name was Steve. Said he was a wrestler. I said, ""Alligators""? And then I made a bad joke about speedos. He seemed embarrassed.

I had no idea who he was or why he might have people wanting his autograph. I have never followed wrestling. When we landed he walked me to the carousel, teased the heck out of me and wanted to drop me at my home in his limo. I declined.

We were walking to the curb together when my ride called. I, still joking around told her what was going on with my new best pal and she suddenly blurted out: STONE COLD STEVE AUSTiN?!! I turned around, cocked my head, squinted at him and asked him if the words ""Stone Cold"" meant anything to him? He started  making excuses about ""entertainment...yadda yadda yadda"". Yeah. Nicest guy ever. I had to look him up when I got home. Gave me a good laugh. My friend who picked me up from the plane never let me hear the end of it."
"He shook my hand before I went to pee. Then when I reentered the comedy club he asked me how it went.

"1. Real Madrid  
2. AC Milan  
3. Bayern Munchen  
4. Barcelona  
5. Ajax  
6. Liverpool  
7. Manchester United  
8. Juventus  
9. Inter  
10. Benfica  

Don't call me biased for being a United fan. I recognize Liverpool should be higher than United. I just can't agree on them being higher than Barcelona and Ajax. 

People love to say Ajax became irrelevant, but let's not act like Liverpool's fluke win in 2005 means they're more relevant. Especially considering how they're performing in the league. 

In my opinion, they're (considering Barcelona here too) big clubs not just for performances on the pitch, but also what they produced in terms of style of football. I think Ajax and Barcelona make a case far more than Liverpool do. 

This might be a bit morbid, but Liverpool's impact in negative ways should also kind of be considered. Looking at the history and seeing Liverpool being the cause for a 5 year ban for English clubs, to me that impacts their stance on this list. 

It makes me want to put Liverpool just below the top 5. Them wining 5 CL's, though, and the lost finals, it does put them ahead of United for me. That's more important from a ""Europe"" perspective, their one league they have over Liverpool makes it irrelevant and recently in Europe, it's hard to put United over Liverpool. 2005 and 2008 being close to each other, 2007 and 2009 as well, and then 2011 and 2018 of course. Cameo appearence from United in 2017 which shouldn't be completely ignored. This all against the argument that Liverpool have fallen off over the years."
My banana slugs seem to be trending in the wrong direction. ðŸ˜ž
How barbaric
Holy shit that sounds like a nightmare! It stinks because they have some (seemingly) nice wooden coffee tables that I planned on ordering. Also deck furniture looks really nice too
ManU b4 Liverpool Hmm...
