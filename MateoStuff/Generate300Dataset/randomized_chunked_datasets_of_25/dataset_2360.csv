32973,best energy drink,"Bang Blue Razz just has a nice classic blue raspberry taste that isn’t overly sweet. Reign’s Orange Dreamsicle is good but a little too chemical tasting. There’s a few other really good Bang flavors (Cherry Blade Lemonade, Purple Haze, Black Cherry Vanilla, Cotton Candy, honestly pretty much all of them except Miami Cola), but I think a Blue Razz Bang is probably my energy drink king."
35824,best alcoholic drink,I tried mixing a few different things with Dr. Pepper the other week but I found that nothing tasted as good as just unadulterated Dr. Pepper.

13674,best research paper archive,"My university offers a service where they will find *any* published document in the world, free of charge.

6124,best Netflix documentary,The Civil War should be required viewing for all Americans. I can't think of a more moving viewing experience.
55783,best action and adventure movie,"It's an action-adventure film with a romance in it. The primary elements are the kidnapping and related action, the romance is secondary. Also, OP specifically mentions not just typical action adventure films. Agreed it's not as good as Raiders, but who the hell hasn't heard of Indiana Jones and really needs it recommended?"
27755,best breakfast foods,"i read somewhere once where someone was struggling with a similar thing and was venting to their therapist, to which their therapist was like, yo, just eat whatever you want for breakfast... you’re trying to be healthy, practice self care, and hate typically breakfast foods? just have a veggie wrap
