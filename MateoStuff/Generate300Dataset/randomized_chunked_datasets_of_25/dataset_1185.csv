61060,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I haven't seen Deadwood but with regards to The Sopranos v. The Wire:  I'd say that The Sopranos had better episode-to-episode writing but The Wire was a better written story from start to finish.  Each season of The Wire is a piece that interlocks with the other for one grand iteration in a very real world cycle whereas each season of The Sopranos comes off more as ""The continued adventures of Tony Soprano!"""
30123,best Mexican war to study,Grant said in his autobiography that the Mexican War made the Civil War inevitable. He viewed it as a disgraceful instance of bullying and felt we Americans ultimately reaped what we had sown.

25447,best cricket teams of all time,"What do you mean based on what.

2015 Aus team got mauled by Eng incl that infamous 60 which was preceded by a less embarrassing 136, not to mention losing 0-2 to Pak in the UAE before the WC.

This Eng team has shown enough cracks on visits abroad and at home as well. No need to elaborate that any further.

The rest of your post makes little sense.

16491,best sunglasses for fashion,"For general everyday use, their bronze lens is actually most recommended.  The rose one is neat in the sense that it's made to be more relaxing...literally looking through rose-colored glass.  However, I didn't like it since it was annoying for me to wait for my eyes to adjust to the color.  I bought the Kolohe, which I'm not seeing, so maybe they discontinued them?  They're by far the best pair I've ever had! Just avoid their superthin glass lens if you're clumsy or planning on doing anything adventurous in them :)

Editing this post to your wrinkle comment... fun fact: Maui Jim is the only brand whose lenses are proven to prevent skin cancer around the eyes!"
