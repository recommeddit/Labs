It must be the time limitation of the oleds turning on once white is detected. Maybe 120hz screens will fix it or most likely MicroLED
"Here's my list of podcasts:

These four are absolutely fantastic, one of which you already listen to. Great hosts and great interaction between co-hosts and guests:

[This Week in Virology](http://www.twiv.tv/)

[This Week in Microbiology](http://www.microbeworld.org/podcasts/this-week-in-microbiology)

[This Week in Parasitism](http://www.microbeworld.org/podcasts/this-week-in-parasitism)

[Brain Science Podcast](http://brainsciencepodcast.com/)

These are all mostly medicine related, all very informative:

[The Health Report](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/healthreport/)

[Nature Medicine Podcast](http://www.nature.com/nm/podcast/index.html)

[Science Magazine Podcast](http://www.sciencemag.org/site/multimedia/podcast/)

These two are short podcasts with lots of little interesting tidbits:

[Natural Selections](http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/programs/local/naturalselections.html)

[BacterioFiles](http://www.microbeworld.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=104&Itemid=270)

I have some more I'm subscribed to but they practically never get new episodes or have just ended:

[One Species at a Time](http://podcast.eol.org/podcast)"
"Deleted the comment because Reddit was showing that I had posted it in GD instead of this thread (but I guess not?) but yeah. They have some sick sci-fi inspo there.

Edit: [the first model on this page](https://www.gentlemonster.com/shop/ver1_detail.php?it_id=1572396236&cata=i0) is what we're referring to here if anyone is curious. Forgive my tech ineptitude"
"Minecraft,
Stardew Valley,
Grid Autosport,
Call of Duty Mobile,
Prison Architect."
"Get ""Pure React"" by david ceddia, by far my best source of learning."
"It's hook is it's open world, the seas, locations to visit, it's a looter, replayable, shit loads of content, lots of weapons and armour. I mean, I've only played 200 hours of it and it's loved by many so what do I know.

Also, grind = rewards, which is always nice."
"America saw itself as the Arsenal of Democracy. It supplied the Allies but the U.S. government didn't make any money. Allies received up to 90% off tanks, bullets, food, planes, basically free destroyers. FDR tried to help the Allies while not getting Americans killed. Pretty noble if you ask me."
If you want to have a super literal interpretation of what is sci-fi and what isn't then go for it dude. Most people are going to ignore you though.
I put TJ Klune’s The Lightening Heart on my list. Can’t wait to read it!
"Subjective, but the two fragrances that I wouldn't debate against even though I don't use them anymore are Dior Homme intense 2011 & Terre D'Hermes EDT"
"He was issued credentials BY THE USPA, not Lodi. That instructor could've died anywhere."
"I don’t have flickering with or without VRR...

I have the 32”"
"Why the hell is that so far down? Long Island Ice Tea? Moscow Mule? ""Tito's Vodka + Club Soda + Slice of Lime""? Reddit, sometimes it's like I don't even know you anymore..."
Sarah Snook was so good in this!
fair enough. I just didn't want people getting dissuaded from what I see as an excellent pair of headphones.
"Where did you hear that the Air overheats? With the new Apple M1 chip, the MacBook Air can run at full tilt for over 8 minutes... you probably won't ever be pushing the laptop that hard anyways.

No, you definitely don't want to get an older Intel model. Compatibility with the Apple M1 chip is starting to improve, and a large handful of programs are already supported. If you're mainly doing browsing, there's really nothing to worry about."
"I mean you also have to take into consideration the cost of living. $15 an hour isn’t shit in NYC while this dude might be balling out there with $15/hr.

If you want perspective you need the whole picture.

Edit: made it more clear so you guys can stop telling me he’s probably not balling on $15/day....no shit."
"Ok, number 1, Portland, OR is completely badass so that's that.

2, Do you have the recipe? I know that alcohol doesn't freeze so a lot of the recipes just say to add it in towards the end - is that what yours says?"
I don't believe in getting pets for kids. What kind of pet do you want? If you don't want any then don't get any.
"They were poor against Italy, but the performance was overshadowed by Zaza memes"
I think my dad would like a cold beer and a nice game of English football to watch. And maybe a new car.
Literally finished Beach Read today. Read it :)
Ive gotten a fair amount of compliments from tobacco vanille by Tom Ford
Don't go in the summer. If you go in the summer it will be really clear why you shouldn't go in the summer.
pcmanfm still rocks.
