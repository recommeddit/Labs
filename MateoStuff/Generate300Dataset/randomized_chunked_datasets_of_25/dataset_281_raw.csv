"I use Chrome solely because a lot of my old passwords are synced with my Google account. For most the accounts I use on the regular, I use a password manager but if I want to move to say Firefox, how can I move my passwords over? Note that the accounts that are synced are the ones that I rarely use and don't give much shit about but I stills don't want to lose them."
"i think its funny how many people from other states go out of their way to trash California, meanwhile those people or their states aren't ever on our radar."
I still read my school's newspaper physical copy.
"Yes, but hotredditaction (I can't believe I just typed that) specified SFTP, not FTP."
"Zebra is very good, which is why I have it installed as a fallback in case my preferred package manager, Sileo, horrifically fails. I like Sileo’s support for native depictions, which Zebra doesn’t have, and I haven’t had any stability issues with Sileo in a long time.


Cydia used to be my fallback package manager, but I replaced it with Zebra the moment it became a real alternative.


In any case, I’m glad the community has multiple decent package managers to choose from, as opposed to the past, when Cydia was the only option."
"Dragon Quest 11, Witcher 3 and Bloodborne/Dark Souls series for PS4 games.

My all time favorite is Final Fantasy 9, which is technically available on PS4, but you’d have to be fine with PS1 graphics."

I’m fond of [Bawston & Tucker](https://bawstonandtucker.com/) solid cologne. You can get a sample set of their different scents for fairly cheap and find one or a few that you like.

Yeah. Not really passionate about a lot of these and all but the top 4 (And maybe Black Panther) have serious potential to go down.

"Anyone can create a reddit. 

Having an employee as one of the mods for a college reddit may be a very good thing because they won't be as transitory as students. Besides, a college reddit should be for students, alumni, prospective students, professors, employees, members of the nearby community that are interested in the college, etc."
"Look at factors like graduation rate, retention rate, ROI, salary after graduation. I think those will indicate the quality of a school/program without having to look at rankings."
"The problem is that there is a lot of inconsistency. Advertisers have decided that anything between 1080p and 4K can be labelled ""2K"". So you get 2560x1080, 2560x1440, and even some less common resolutions with the 2K label if you search Amazon. And technically speaking, 1080p is to actual 2K as 3840x2160 is to cinema 4K."

"I'm in a similar boat. Want an EV for woodworking and home improvement.

I'm likely getting an f150 lightning. However, I'm probably opting for the 40k pro model. Which may or may service you as well if it's your only car given the range.

The reason I'd get the pro model is because the long range is going to be at least 63k. Which is an XLT. The lariat is 80k. And there very little a standard range XLT has over the Pro for me. I don't think the trucks worth that price, and it's mainly because of the DC charge speed. if I got the expensive model, it'd be the primary family road trip car as well. But at only 150kw max charge speed. For a 400 mile trip, that's an hour and a half of charging added to the trip. Not acceptable in my book. I would say their DC charge speed is already dated. 

The 80K lariat is on par with the specs of the 67k rivian. Only key difference is the bed size which can still hold a sheet of plywood flat, it'll just have slightly more overhang than the f150. 

The rivian is the better deal at that price point and it has faster charging, which would cut charge times in half.

I was initially going to get the Rivian, but based on my reservation date, I wouldn't probably be offered one for purchase until 2023. I expect to be first in line for the f150. 

For Rivian, i think it's entirely possible they come out with a better build of a truck than ford. And service can be better unless you are not near a major city. 

The only other truck to keep an eye out for is GM. They should reveal it later this year, but I doubt theyd be lauching it in 2022. 

Ordering an f150 this fall should be risk free and you'd have until delivery to accually purchase it. So if something better comes up, you can change your mind next spring."
Give Rise of Empires a watch too. Got some documentary style narration and interviews mixed in with some fairly decent acting scenes.
Also mainly use nautilus. Sometimes thunar for renaming.
Fuck yeah!
My desk has aukey c to c and c to lightning on my desk clipped down so aesthetically pleasing that they match. And is not like a standard white cable
