37279,best amusement park,"Knott’s just feels more accessible. MM is a chore to traverse, and covers a lot of ground."
69810,best major to study in college,"I have a liberal arts degree -- don't get one of those

and I work in IT -- do that.

because I taught myself web development & took some IT courses (programming-related ones) -- do that.


To be honest, 

Sometimes I think if I could do it all over again, spend my teens learning IT skills during summers, evenings, & weekends (basically as much as possible), then skip college and go straight to work.

But then I think... I wouldn't be the same person without the more expansive worldly & historical perspective I acquired in college.

So, I think I'd really try and combine those two--

If I ever have kids, have them go to IT camps, get IT tutors, and study whatever they want.

But at least learn the tools (IT-- I think that's where it's at b/c it empowers work to get done)"
73868,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I highly recommend the Elecom Rough Matte screen protector. I used the Paperlike, iCarez and the TechArmor and the Elecom is absolutely fantastic. I draw and write on my ipad and it feels the closest to pencil to paper. I cant give it enough praise."
9361,best toothpaste,"Not in the dental field, but my dentists have always suggested Listerine or Act. My current dentist helped me figure out that Crest Pro Health was actually staining my teeth (it's even a warning on their label), so I would avoid that."
8427,best toothpaste,"When you pronounce GlaxoSmithKline fast, it sounds like an alien language"
19874,best workout music,Denzel Curry. His album Taboo has some BANGERS
42143,movies like Inception,Now You See Me

37349,best amusement park,Same can be said with Worlds of Fun.
52791,best hiphop album,"Don't see many fellow Aesopians around here. I prefer Skelethon, but Shrunk is one of my favourite tracks by him."
13648,best research paper archive,How would you cite it without access to the journal's specific page numbers?
20841,best workout music,"I see I've been sleeping on Waka's music.

Nice guy, I met him once in the Galleria"
72447,best keyboard switches,"For starters, go to you local electronics store and buy a red, brown, then a blue board. Return them all after you've spent an evening with them in your home. The way keyboards sound in the store doesn't do a great job of explaining how they'll sound in your home.

I thought I wanted blue's at first but had to return it when the neighbors started complaining that my ~~music~~ keyboard was too loud. 

edit: what would be even better is if you went to a keyboard meetup in your area so you could try all kinds of switches and setups."
13983,best research paper archive,"I am pleased that you have researched the topic!  It is always a pleasure when people discover glass can be used in many applications.
I intend on having Boccaccini as one of my reviewers in an upcoming paper, ironic that you chose one of his papers.
Hench is essentially the father of bioglass, he has a nice review of technologies encompassing both the bioceramics and bioglass.  

[Hench Review 1](http://dev.ceramics.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/hench_bioceramics.pdf)
[Hench Review 2](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/960.07/people/Lafuente_Luis/hw0305/Science295_1014_02.pdf)

These reviews provide a good overview of the technologies as they  exist, or where they are headed.

What aspects of it interest you?  I might be able to point you in the direction of some good papers."
22914,best celebrity,"I met Summer Glau a couple months or so ago, she was absolutely lovely. Really sweet and down-to-earth. Extra gorgeous irl too."
44862,best items under $100,"Please tell me you're like 5'1"" because i have this really comical imagine in my mind right now"
52437,best hiphop album,"Oh it flows well and it isn’t bad, it’s just a bit bland IMO. Other Albums like TPAB, Liquid Swords, Deltron, Madvillainy, and a Piece of strange flow together well but still have unique/interesting production on each track."
15952,best sunglasses for fashion,"I found that paying a bit more for glasses made me take better care of them.  My go-to pair right now is the AO Aviators.  At 65$, I take care of them, but won't anguish over them if I break or lose them.  Also, if they're good enough for NASA, they're certainly good enough for me."
2424,best headphones,Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro - best Headphones I've ever owned. Like wearing plushy clouds over your ears that make everything you thought sounded good sound at least 10 times better.
1854,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,I'm actually here with my girlfriend for fall classes. So I guess I'm just half tourist lol. We're staying with her mom who lives here.
22913,best celebrity,"A week after 9/11, my father (an NYC carpenter) stepped into an elevator with Ben Affleck. It was just the two of them in the elevator and they were both going to one of the upper floors of a very tall building. They ended up talking about the attacks on the twin towers and got into a deep conversation about how human beings are cruel to each other for a bit. According to my father, he was a really cool, intelligent, and down to earth guy. I know that it is supposed to be about a celebrity that I have personally met, but I thought that this was a cool story."
35398,best alcoholic drink,Tastes like college!
66696,best soccer team in the world,What tournaments
57209,best water brand,I’ve always wanted to try this water to see if it’s worth the hype. Hopefully one day when I’m not broke af I’ll give it a shot lol
886,best desk lamp,"I have the same IKEA one, can definitely recommend it. Lost some springyness after a while but the simple design made it easy to just tighten the springs so now it's all good. Attaches to a wall, desk, etc. Can be screwed in or clipped on an edge. Flexibility = awesome!"
