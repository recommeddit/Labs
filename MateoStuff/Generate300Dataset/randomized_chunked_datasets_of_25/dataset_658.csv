36536,best alcoholic drink,Thank you for giving me a name for such a coveted of drinks. Always enjoy how well the liqueur covers the vodka taste. It ends up tasting like some drankalicous Liqueur with just a bit of extra fire in the after taste
3127,best webcamera,"They are terrible because people are unwilling to pay $200+ for a camera for video calls.

Elgato recently released one thats not actually terrible.

If you really care get a proper camera and use HDMI capture. Unfortunately my work laptop is too locked down to allow use of a HDMI capture dongle or my Canon cameras webcam drivers so it's a shitty C270 for me. With the Elgato I can use my own PC to get the settings right and then plug it into my work PC."

I also like a good dirty Shirley, really brings on the nostalgia!"
8009,best laptop for general use,"Thank you, I appreciate the clarification."
73584,best battery bank,That list isn't very useful because it doesn't state their wattage output on each port. Which is the main consideration I have other than price.
44118,best items under $100,"I think [that was my article!](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-truth-about-cast-iron.html)

Yes: you can wash a cast iron pan and it will not destroy the seasoning, the reason being that seasoning is polymerized oil (I.E. a plastic bonded to the surface of the pan), so surfactants like soap which will break down oil will not affect it. Just be sure to dry it carefully, heat it up, and rub it with a little oil to protect it after each use."
