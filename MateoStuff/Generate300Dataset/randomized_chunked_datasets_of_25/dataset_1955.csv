21105,best workout music,"I prefer no music myself. I did listen to music before but I've started to appreciate silence so I can have 100% focus on the lifting.

Of course it's never going to happen but it would sure be better. Some people prefer to have a meditation approch to weightlifting, and then the music is probably going to be distracting."
