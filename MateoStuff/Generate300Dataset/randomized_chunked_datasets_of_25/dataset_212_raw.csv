I was really into the story and at the time didn't know there were 3 more books. The last line promised more story that I had yet to discover.
"Yeah, it’s unfortunate how it’s virtually skipped over in history classes, too. I didn’t even know about My Lai until I took a history class taught by a Vietnam veteran in college."

"Why would he go to a third party country for a trial for something that happened in the United States (and to the United States, in the case of the embassy bombings)?
