"I came here to mention Canticle and Handmaid's Tale. I think the OP's list is a good ""sci-fi books you should read if you're into sci-fi,"" while yours is a great ""sci-fi books you should read if you're into books."""
"Heh, my parents had the credit card, so mine was bought with reward-points (free shipping and monogramming too)."
"I'm in Cambodia right now, and I'm about to take a 1 hour flight instead of a 10 hour bus for $70"
"Are you kidding? Maybe it's just a Canadian thing but rye is the go-to whiskey for everyone I know, and absinthe is almost never turned away."
"Your cat needs more enrichment, otherwise it wouldn't be interested in escaping. The way you describe the poor thing running out describes a trapped animal under stress attempting to escape. If she does come back, try creating a more engaging environment for her. Lots of ledges, places to climb and play on, places to hide, different kinds of toys, and create a schedule for her,  consisting of feeding, playing, affection, and training. And make sure her litter box is clean, otherwise she'll escape to find a better place to do her business. If you can train her to walk on a harness, take her for walks. 


If she doesn't come back, I would suggest waiting a few years before getting another pet. At least until your daughter can more actively care for it and you can create a more positive environment for an animal. Cats and dogs were never meant to live in an apartment and even though we may live in them, we leave them every day. It's very challenging to create a good environment for animals when you keep them inside.


I suggest starting a window or balcony garden or getting a fish, but make sure to get an appropriate sized tank.  If she wants something cuddly, get her a furby or robo pet. She might like it better once she realizes she can take it anywhere and it won't run away."
"I think they're doomed to succeed, and I **really loathe** that."
"Ohmygod Midnight Club was amazing! I spent so many hours playing that, and making my own maps, it was so glorious."

God even the Trader Joe’s brand hand sanitizer smells like horrific off-brand tequila puke
"I would like to see one of these for every country, surely they can't be the same."

"I guess they could, i think theres probably several ways to do it. You should try one, the cavities arent THAT bad"
"Xia is a DLC as well, but it doesn't have the expansion that I've heard is essential to make it better."
"Infinity war is the “best” but Endgame is my favorite.

Hulk is ass."
Most songs by NCS (nocopyrightsounds) are really good for working out.
28! I make beer in my spare time!
"I'm sure it's different from person to person, but I've heard a lot of others complain about their comfort as well. The main issue was that they only covered about 95% of my ears, so a small part of my ear was getting pinched. With the slightly bigger pads that's not an issue."
"Chloé, their original perfume. Everyone I know likes it, including my brother who is a bit sensitive to smells and my mum who is quite picky."
"I did. Thanks for the reminder! 

I actually installed it, but then had to restore my phone, and I guess that install wasn't backed up. Just re-installed today."
"Right now my top 3 are Terraforming Mars, Agricola, and Castles of Burgundy"
">[Starbase Orion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starbase-orion/id438375580) \- A remake of the classic Masters of Orion game. Fantastic, deep old-school space empire 4X. Highly recommended but be warned this game has a learning curve, but also a small yet dedicated online player base of veterans who are more than willing to help you learn.

This right here is a SUPER underappreciated gem. If you haven't played it and you're in the thread talking about Civ (or have any fond memories of Star Trek: Birth of the Federation) get this game."
