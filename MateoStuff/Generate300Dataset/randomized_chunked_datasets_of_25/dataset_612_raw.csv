Idk.  We might have had a better team with Hadlee but I'm too young to remember that."
It seems you have found the your balance between a signature scent and an everyday scent that is both suitable for office wear and night out. Congrats!!!
"I was using Firefox, switched to Brave, from Brave to Edge, Edge to Opera GX, then after using all of these, Deleted them, came back to Firefox. Why? It is the Browser for me. It's Simple, easily Customizable and User Friendly than ALL the other Browsers. Brave is a good Alternative but for me Firefox is Better than it. Don't use Opera GX, it's known for Selling Browser History. Edge is very Average. Firefox's the Best currently. Try it out."

The recipe I've used is similar to this. I usual add different fruits and nuts. You can add more

Even Horizon from BPAL. Most of my perfumes come from them.
"I'll try my best to come up with alternate solutions for a while, but this sounds like a good 'plan B' if I end up running out of time.

What I present at the conference is up to me, there is no pressure. I just thought I'd do my best with the time I have.

I’m FROM Ohio and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a mars bar in my life. Definitely never received one trick or treating.

"Wrong, Chad Henne is at 1 and HoF NVP Mitch Trubisky is at a close second with Bortles."
Dimitri Martin. His newest show literally had me laughing out loud for at least 70% of it. But all his shows are hilarious.
"It works! If you have a website to find listings, are willing to do a bit of research and don't mind negotiating a bit (I hate that part), you can save literally tens of thousands of dollars. Realtors are car salesmen and are completely redundant in this day and age"
"Search bar my dude. Prob Anacapaca > Santa Cruz >= Santa Rosa > other dorms, if you want on campus. Ofc some people love FT, but some people don’t like it because of the distance. So opinions about FT (San Cat) can be pretty polarizing."
"I’d disagree with Idaho. Northern Idaho is all about Silverwood, but SE Idaho, which has a larger population, barely realizes that it exists. South East Idaho is basically an extension of Utah, and everyone here loves Lagoon."
"I came from a iPhone 7 maybe a month ago. Just go and buy it, don’t have how to compare it. Have an amazing camera, ridiculous battery, longevity, processor, a great big screen and I’m sure that the next iOS will be smooth, don’t worry about it"
Cowboys from Hell by Pantera. Or 5 minutes alone.
"Nobody finds Tom Scott. Tom Scott finds you with randomly suggested, but moderately intriguing video titles when you said one more video 3 hours ago and now it's 4am..."
I recommend you to check out Chris's other works which are actually a bit more well made than Interstellar and Inception.
"Hm, here in Scandinavia there has been a huge peak in racism and nationalism over the last years - so it depends"
