50587,best rap album,"> Being a studio engineer doesn't make you any more qualified to judge what the best produced rap album is

A studio engineer who is interested in Hip Hop is. It's like saying being a film director doesn't make you any more qualified to judge what the best directed film is. If you're qualified in that sector, of course you are more qualified to judge it, at least more than the average listener. 

Being somehow involved, professionally,  in production/mixing/mastering will definitely make you more qualified. Especially when most of what makes production good IS the correct use of audio engineering. You can be as creative and ""out there"" as you want, but if you can't adjust the mix to reflect the emotion of instruments used and make everything peak correctly then the production WILL sound shit."

33565,best electric car,">	I think we’re all a lot more alike than different and we all want to see more BEV and less ICE. Cheers.

56309,best desktop monitor,"If you win the IPS glow lottery, maybe the LG 27GN950-B for SDR.
 
Hard to beat it: 
27"" 4k 144hz (160hz w/ update) IPS (1440p upscales on it just fine) 

But it's only HDMI 2.0, but how many console games actually push 4k/120hz? You can run some of the others at 1080p/120. 

For HDR, your best bet is to just go for the 48"" LG CX OLED - this one would be everything you could ask for were it not for the size."
