31120,best country to live in,Most of what you said has a good chance of being irrelevant. Is it brick layers moving to Oz or tech workers/social science workers? Having said that NZ might be like Eastern Europe; good opportunities for tech but not so good for the rest (social science)

22477,best celebrity,"Jeff Goldblum is one of the nicest men in the world and was my best friend for 20 minutes.

When I was 14, I was in the children's chorus of a professional opera company and his at the time gf (now wife!) was in a production as a featured Cirque du Soleil acrobat. He was backstage before one of the shows, but no one was approaching him (idk if they were shy or just trying see seem cool and chill while a celebrity was around). Awkward ass 14 year old me finally gathers up some courage and goes up to him and says ""Excuse me, Mr. Goldblum? I just really wanted to say I loved you in The Big Chill"" (which I'm sure is not the film he expected to come out of a 14 y/o's mouth). He took a picture with me and then we just talked for a solid 20 minutes. He asked me all about being a kid working at an opera theater and what I wanted to do when I grew up. And he was so engaged and you could tell genuinely cared and was interested in what this awkward looking little 14 y/o has to say. So that's the story of when I hung out with my 20-minute bff Jeff Goldblum backstage."

6866,best iPhone,"Are you a fan of cases? In this case (hehe) I’d recommend the 12-line since Apple’s cases, especially the silicone ones, got much better in terms of feeling and looks."
45396,best gaming system,"Own a PC and PS4, Xbox, Switch and PSVita. They all have their uses depending on type of game, but my PC gets the most playtime. Maybe part of it is because my PC is powerful enough to crush most games and on top of that the ability to use my PS4 or Xbox controller. Playing couch co-op games like Overcooked 2 with the gf, using both the Xbox and Ps4 controller at the same time couldn't be easier. Whilst personally being into heavy strategy games like Anno 1800 where mouse + keyboard gaming is a must. I may get a Ps5 when there's enough stock and prices even out, or when the inevitable re-design comes. In the end, if I can enjoy Playstation games on my PC I almost always prefer to play on PC (also I'm not a trophy hunter)."

72256,best adblocker extension,"That's actually a good question, I never thought of that. Does this work for you? There's often posts about how Facebook ads return and a lot of advice for adding filters, but never that. Last time I tried to get help here, I was faced with a lot of cultish bullshit about how it's all Google's fault (I use Chrome) and therefore there's nothing possible to do and what a jerk I was for not believing Google has it in for me. That's what prompted me to try Adguard, a lo and behold, it worked flawlessly. I can't remember why, but I eventually came back to uBlock - probably for lower resource usage. And I stopped bothering to ask for help."
40066,best Chrome extensions,"Todoist has been my #1 daily tool for the past 5 years - I have a shit memory but by using this tool it is extremely rare for me to forget to accomplish a task no matter how small. Given an objective at work? It goes on the list. SO needs to have an oil change this weekend? On the list. Gotta pay that one off bill? Boom, list. 

I love it but I understand that it doesn't work for everyone. It does take a certain level of diligence to populate and maintain."

16382,best sunglasses for fashion,"Pepper's Sunglasses. One of the few glasses that aren't owned by Luxotica. They are from Pennsylvania. Only $45 each and can be replaced in any condition for $20

I  like the Sunset Boulevard style, with the blue lenses. I am mad they discontinued the blue frames, but had to settle for the grey frames with blue lenses. I am a big fan of the brand, the only problem is this style doesn't float, but other styles do.

68201,best science fiction novel,"Mostly going to try to list stuff unmentioned 

In the Ocean of Night by Gregory Benford a sweeping saga of humanity vs implacable alien adversary from near future to distant

Snowcrash so incredibly influential it seems cliche if you’ve never read it

Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson hard to go wrong with Robinson

Dhalgren by Samuel R Delaney so trippy 

Celestial Empire series by Chris Roberson alternate history with ascendant China & Aztecs in space

Wasteland of Flint by Thomas Harlan a totally different alternate history future but also Aztecs about an exo anthropologist"
66867,best soccer team in the world,"i think it is worth mentioning though that its not the best/most expensive squads other than the different number of players.  
france could swap in upamencano (60mil), camavinga (55mil), dembele (55mil), mendy (50mil), ndombele (50mil) and l.hernandez (45mil).  
but england is also not counting rashford (85mil), foden (80mil) or maddison (55mil) here"

41484,best instrument to play,"Is this just for yourself, or do you actually want to perform? If you want to play on stage with a group, Clarinet or Cello, depending on whether you are interested in band or orchestra. You can play clarinet in both, but you need to be really good. 

I'd do violin if it were just for myself. 

Why those? Piano is great for music theory, but it's not that interesting to me - you don't have much control over how beautiful you sound, and it all sounds the same. With a cello or violin, you can pluck the string, you can play with a bow, play with a bow upside down, add vibrato, don't add vibrato... you have a lot more control over what you sound like. 

I'd pick cello for orchestra because they always need cellos and they have gorgeous melody lines, or fantastically dramatic ones. Listen to the beginning of Beethoven's 3rd. Yep, that's cello. Bass lines in classical are awesome, unless you're a tuba. 

Clarinet for band because you are the equivalent of a violin section in a band, and you can do rhapsody in blue/cantina band jazz awesomeness. If you can get really good, you can play in orchestras as well. So... pretty much everything.

Violin if for myself only because there are tons of solo violin stuff. And it's easy to transport - I swear I'm going to try busking someday."
