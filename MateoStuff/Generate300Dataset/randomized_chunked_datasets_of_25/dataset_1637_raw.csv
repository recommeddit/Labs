"IMO  Silver Dollar city is better than Six Flags in Missouri. Holiday World is awesome in Indiana, the Water park is world class and the coasters are
 good, the other rides are pretty blah though"

"From the research I did both the LG27GL850-B and Dell S2721DGF are very good, each edging other out in various categories. I ended up ordering the Dell, but if you find a good price on the LG then you are not making a mistake either.

Out of curiosity (it doesn't exist in my country) how much does a 0.5 liter bottle cost?
"Comment reported.

I mean, saved! I’ll watch it sometime soon (will be my fourth), and then the vid you posted. Thanks."
"I'd say just use high end ingredients. Whole fat milk from pasture raised cows, high end free range eggs, olive oil, all blended together in a food processor. That's really all I do. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful."
TN panels are far superior for gaming due to the very quick response time. It's still isn't fast enough for color to color and causes some ghosting even at high refresh rate.
30 something universities from india. I call bullshit. We fake research to unprecedented level. We are masters at stealing western research with few edits.
I watched this last night. The second part was pretty profound
Get the 8tracks app (free & awesome) and stream the caked up trap remix playlist... 10/10 lift more weight when trap is in the ears

"Fun little anecdote about Bryd, from when I was interning in Congress about 8 years ago.

He was very old at the time and had fairly poor eyesight. He still liked to go out to the floor in his wheelchair though and give speeches, so he would get an aid to print out his speeches on paper with massive font, we are talking about around 2 sentences a page. He would then proceed to sit with a giant stack of paper and go through his speech.

He also had a special wheel-chair accessible phone booth installed for him in the Democratic whip room.

He was an incredibly respected guy."
"I really like Zealios V2 -- great tactility and smoothness at the same time. That said, I am finding the clicky Box Navies I am trying out to be a lot of noisy fun :)."
"Don’t know if this will get seen, just want to say thanks to you all ! Put me on a lot of new music this Friday ! Much love 🤙🏽"
I fuckin hate the eagles
"Grammarly offers a free version. It's not the full version, but its not bad."
"this isn't about a one off match in one venue though, think about these lineups playing in 5 grounds - MCG, Lords, Wankhede, Centurion and SCG (personal favourite) which batting line up would perform the best across those 5?"
"> The new guy is spot on in a well executed series.

That sounds like Disney's signature."
"there’s a great horror film called [Proxy (2013)](https://boxd.it/6iEO) that throughout the entire film you have absolutely no idea where its going to take you. not for the faint of heart by the way, but i really dont want to spoil it."
"The only problem I ran into was Google Earth Studio, wasn't able to use it :("
Pricey but the [Logitech G Pro Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Gaming-Esports-Performance/dp/B07GCKQD77) is a very nice lightweight wireless mouse.
"They have 300 million people. If you can't find a group, it's you."
It's a movie with insane plot twists.
"Honestly I would try to find an older one online. I'm a refrigeration/hvac tech and I have worked on a few very high end fridges. They aren't made like they used to, same with hvac equipment. Sub zero fridges which are around 8000 bucks aren't built any stronger then a cheap one as far as the mechanics. Same compressor same evap/condenser. The old deep freezers were built alot thicker/stronger."
