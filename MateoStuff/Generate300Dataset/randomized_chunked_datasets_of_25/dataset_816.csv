36119,best alcoholic drink,"**The Pickleback**

Sounds disgusting, tastes amazing, the most dangerous drink on the planet due to how fast and thoughtlessly they can be consumed.  I haven't been as drunk the night I was shown it since before they banned all the fun energydrink booze; **you have been warned**.

**•1 shot Jameson Whiskey** (or any whiskey)
**•1 shot kosher dill pickle brine** (that's the juice in the jar)
**Drink them, in that order.**  The brine shot is like a MrClean magic eraser for your tongue.  
(Don't mess up the order or use the wrong pickles, it will be gross!)
I always have to do one with the person I show them to, they always think it's a trick."
