2408,"There are headphones that go well into the thousands, some even in five-figure territory.  

Personally (and I say this as an audio engineer) I think it just becomes a wank after a certain point. The differences taper off quickly, and most people are going to be listening on shitty earbuds anyway. That's not to say you can't hear any quality difference, or that you shouldn't work just as hard on your mix - but it's easy to think anything sounds amazing with good enough speakers.  

It's kind of like wine. You can buy a shitty bottle for $10, a decent one for $25, or a really nice one for $100. You can also buy a super nice one for a couple grand - but most people aren't going to notice a huge difference between the $100 and the $2000 bottle.",best headphones

56058,"I'm sure some will disagree but I prefer Temple of Doom over Last Crusade. A lot of people put Crusade above Doom but I feel that's mostly because they want the same thing out of an Indiana Jones film. Crusade is a little too much ""Raiders 2.0"" for me. I like how Doom changed things up.

Temple of Doom is so great, not quite as good as Raiders, but still a blast. It has some of the best set pieces (the opening, mine cart chase, rope bridge), I love the creepy cult vibe instead of recycling Nazi's, short round and Willie are really funny (she's supposed to be irritating, which makes it more amusing when Indy gets pissed at her), and a dude gets his heart pulled out through his chest! Shit is awesome. Last Crusade is a lot of fun and I love it as well but it feels like a sitcom version of Raiders.",best action and adventure movie

4047,"Everybody fucks up, to a degree.  Man, I'd love to go back and do my Bachelor's all over.  But now... I have my MS and I'm a college professor.  There was another professor at this school who only had a high school degree and was a forklift driver.  She got hurt on the job, had to go on disability, was all like fuck this, and now has a PhD and is a writing professor.  Fucking up doesn't mean you're screwed for life, and it doesn't matter how old you are or where you are in your education.

The important thing to remember about online education (I teach in a Master's program online) is that, while convenient, it is just as intense, involved, challenging, and time-consuming (or even more time-consuming) as regular face-to-face courses.  Most students do not realize this.  To be candid, if I had a student with a demanding full-time job and a baby on the way, I'd counsel them to wait. I'd counsel them VERY STRONGLY.  If, however, you're getting a degree and you need to take those bothersome courses that duplicate your certificate knowledge, they might be a lot easier; this would make your studies easier, content-wise.  Also pay attention to courses with synchronous (ie, ""live"") components.  If your life is such that you cannot log onto a class every Tuesday night at 7 p.m. (and it will be 7 p.m. local time to the university teaching the course - keep that in mind), it's not a reasonable thing to do.

And do watch out for reputation and credibility of the institution, as previous Redditors have mentioned.  We are unimpressed if we get applications from people who got their degree at Phoenix or Walden.  It's easy enough to see evaluations of specific programs online.

If the Redditors below are making recommendations based on experience, that's excellent!",best online college
