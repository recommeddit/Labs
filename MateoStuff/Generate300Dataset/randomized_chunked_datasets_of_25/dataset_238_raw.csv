"Gone Girl. 

Without majorly spoiling it, I watched with my boyfriend (who had not seen it) and the first half of the movie, he was SO angry with Nick's character. By the second half/the first twist, his attitude completely reversed. It was amazing. And he can usually call a twist pretty quickly."
"In order of my preference:

1. Xbox One X if you want the best graphics and online services
2. PS4 Pro if you want strong character-driven single-player campaigns.
3. PS4 if you're on a budget
4. Nintendo Switch if you like Nintendo franchises and/or have friends who also own the Switch and you want to play with them.

Don't bother with an Xbox One S. If you want an Xbox, get the One X."

You say that but you're still responding instead of ignoring me. Sounds like you're curious how I **could** convince you.
I switch between both. Sometimes I'll read for half hour... other times 30 pages or whatever. I do LIKE reading.. I just allowed myself to become easily distracted over the years by other things which were more interactive and therefore more mentally stimulating.
"Uhhh, in graduating this semester and planning on going to graduate school and heading toward probably the research and academic route, so I’m not sure I’ll be as much help. If you’re proficient in analysis the CIA and FBI, etc. look for individuals in Linguistics."
"This paper is one of the most misinterpreted papers in CS. Partly that is because of proliferation of summaries of it, partly because popular media has projected the ""Turing Test"" as a way to determine if computers ""think"". Each person in turn, uses his own definition of ""thinking"". Let me quote from the paper itself ;

> The original question, ""Can machines think?"" I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion. 

As you said, many modern researchers don't really care whether a machine is ""intelligent"" or not, but care about what it can do. Turing does explicitly talks about this at the end.

> We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even this is a difficult decision. Many people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English."
"My all time favorite is TF Beau de Jour. it just works on me. Need to include Chanel Platinum Egoiste and Prada Luna Rossa Black for that same reason. After that, I’d say Creed Himalaya (even though it’s so similar to CPE), TF Ombré Leather, and for something less serious and more fun, Eros."
Pretty much anything from Darren Aronofsky.

"It used to seem to drain my laptop battery pretty quickly. Usually I’ll use Hulu to watch a 30 minute show as I fall asleep, without auto play on. By the end I’m asleep and the laptop goes into sleep mode.  Using chrome my laptop is dead by morning. Using Firefox it still has the majority of power in the morning. Not sure if chrome wasn’t letting it go to sleep properly or just used that many resources. Regardless, I quit using it."
I watched that movie five times before I realized the skinny junkie with the gun at the beginning of the film is Donnie Wahlberg.

"Looking at the list, it feels so incredible at how old most of the entries are. I think the highest ranked one is *The Forever War* at #17. 

Compare that to fantasy, where I feel like there are so many excellent books still coming out. Hard to draw the conclusion that SF is not in a rut."

"I agree that Hyperion was amazing and the others were run-of-the-mill... That said, I enjoyed all four."
"Yep, just `<space>w` writes the buffer from normal mode...two key presses that are already right under where my fingers are positioned. From insert mode, it's `jk<space>w`, four key presses that are also right under where my fingers are positioned. For me anyway, that's much easier than moving my hand all the way up to `<esc>` and then having to reach for a shift to get a `:` then `w`, and finally `<CR>`...which is a total of 5 key press that are spread out all over the keyboard.

The customization is one of the things I really like about vim. I have lots and lots of these. One example is if I type `iff<C-]>` in insert mode... it will insert this into the file:

    if () {  
    }

And position the cursor inside the conditional of the if statement, still in insert mode, so I can just start typing the condition. I also have `forr<C-]>` which will insert this in a php file:

    foreach ($ as $) {
    }

​ and this in a js file:

    for ( in ) {
    }

and position the cursor exactly where it needs to so I can just start typing the array name that I want to loop through. Using its ftplugin feature, vim will detect the current filetype of the buffer and use the correct substitution that you've specified for that filetype...as long as there is a plugin for that filetype, which there usually is. However, you can also add custom plugins for filetypes. And all this just scratches the very first layer of paint on the surface of vim's customizability.

Not too sure why all the downvotes on my original reply...people are just afraid of vim, I suppose....or they're fucking dicks.

Thanks for posting this!
Some of the rankers also have massive bias for their own team.
