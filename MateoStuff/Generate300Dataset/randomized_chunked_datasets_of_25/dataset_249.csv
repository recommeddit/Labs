1. Great America
2. Over Georgia
3. Over Texas
4. St. Louis
5. Fiesta Texas
6. Darien Lake
7. Great Adventure 
8. SF America

Great America is the cleanest, has the most well rounded collection of rides, a good layout, decent theming, decent food, and the best operations and customer service. Never had a bad day there.

The original 3 SF parks have a certain charm to them, more history, and a lot of tree cover. Georgia is the prettiest and has the best coaster collection. Texas has a good collection, has a gorgeous old section, but an ugly Gotham section. St. Louis is beautiful and has the best woodie collection out of the SF parks, but lacks in steel coasters. 

Fiesta Texas is beautiful, but doesn't have as much of an abundance of good rides. There's very little shade. However, the theming is the best in the chain, and three of the coasters use the terrain, and they make the trip worth it.

Darien Lake had the best food I've had at a SF park, and had a shockingly awesome coaster collection, at least four very underrated coasters. Very little ads, and a unique feeling to the park, and very pleasant. 

Great Adventure has great coasters and the skyride makes getting around easier, but that's it. The park is very ugly and needs a fresh coat of paint, and the food is quite bad. SFA has the same issue, except with a worse layout, no transportation, and not as many rides.",best roller coaster at six flags
