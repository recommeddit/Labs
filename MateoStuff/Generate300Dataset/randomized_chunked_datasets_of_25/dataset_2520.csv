One thing I discovered recently is a new(ish) string of hardware stores called Trust Hardware. They are open 24 hours every day!!! So if you have an issue in the middle of the night or a holiday when all others are closed, they have a lot of repair parts. Looks like they have 3 location now.",best home improvement store

26559,"Forbidden Island is VERY basic. Great for teaching children cooperation. Great intro to coop games for anyone but as adults, my family played it once, enjoyed it, but not enough to play it a second time.

I've heard Desert is better for adults/experienced players.",best board games
26560,"I guess I'll be the lone person saying that I like Forbidden Island more than Forbidden Desert, only because Forbidden Desert feels a lot easier to win. I enjoy the mad dash to escape at the end of Forbidden Island, where you know that despite making the best moves you could've, you can still lose if you're unlucky. 

Of course, you can still get screwed over by randomness in Forbidden Desert, but it's more of a slow death if that makes sense. I agree though that it has more interesting mechanics, with the sand and the sliding tiles and all. Both are fun, hope you enjoy it!",best board games

55694,"Very little known series of three books called Death's Head by David Gunn.

The lead is 98% human and 2% something else. The books are extremely violent, have amazing action scenes, and they just dial everything up to 11. 

I think the author would be writing the fourth book, but no one is really sure because the author is very publicity shy and David Gunn is definitely a pseudonym.",best action and adventure novel series

69848,"Pro: Very interesting material, especially if its a topic you like.
Its similar skills as a history degree but more marketable.

Con: Be prepared to work in NYC, DC, or abroad cause thats where pretty much all the IR jobs are. Also can be a pro, depends on how you feel about living there.
Not a bad job market but not great either, it can be tough to break into.
Use as many connections as you can to land a job",best major to study in college
69840,"It's a great major. You'll learn things about the earth you never would in any other field. Field work is fun. If your experience in it is anything like mine, be prepared to work in a lab for a lot of the first few years. Job prospects are great even with just a Bachelor's. Also, rocks are a good present to give to people if they are particularly nice, I like to give people slabs of Copper ore. It looks really nice when cut and polished and it's cool because I got it myself.

Advice: Invest in a good pair of hiking boots, a rock hammer, a hand lens, pocket knife, and a good backpack. Optionally a tent and sleeping bag and other basic camping gear because you don't want to be that guy who always asks to share a tent/ other essentials.",best major to study in college
53396,I've seen UGREEN deals a lot but their Fakespot ratings are terrible for all their chargers and cables. I'd rather be safe with Anker/Aukey/Ravpower. I have to admit that I use to think these brands weren't reliable a few years ago so maybe UGREEN will make it to my 'acceptable' list in a few years.,best usb c charging cable
10971,"Yeah, not sure what the current models look like.  Mine isn't huge at all, but as mentioned, it is an old bag.  It's pretty ""normal"" backpack size.  17"" laptops weren't really a thing at that time though.  I know a lot of bags these days are made to accommodate 17"" laptops.",best backpack for college
68814,">Think of it less as a definitive list of the best books in the order of greatness, and more of just a list of great books.

That was pretty much my impression too.

Seeing Ender's Game at #1 set a poor tone for it, and then I scanned down the list and saw a bunch of shallowly predictable choices.  But as I kept going... The Stars My Destination, A Canticle for Liebowitz, The Man in the High Castle, Player of Games, Hyperion, Eon, The Forever War, Way Station, many, many more...

It's pretty much a list of 100 great books - it just seems sort of randomly ordered.",best science fiction novel
