31915,best hotel to live in,"I've done it in Thailand repeatedly and loved it. 
I stayed in a little beach bungalow for three months once. This is quite awhile back and at that time got it down to eight dollars a night. I would even take short trips but kept the place and my stuff in it. You can make it nice, buy some flowers for yourself and put some trinkets down. Don't think I would like it per se in a luxury hotel, too impersonal. 
I have repeatedly done the same thing in a friendly guest house in Chieng Mai, usually for a month. I always look for a cozy place, usually a corner room with good light coming in. I call these rooms my bunkers. I like the solace and do extended yoga sessions and journal writing, reading etc. while there."

Last November out of paranoia, I put her on a healthcare plan that subsidizes some vet treatments and free checkups. We caught her condition within a month of it beginning thanks to that and I’m extremely optimistic we’re going to be able to manage it. Cats are some of the best companions ever."

30861,best country to live in,"I think a strong but well-spoken Paisley accent is the best one in the country. It makes me blush.

1469,best ice cream flavor,"Top 3 in order: Mint Chocolate Chip, Coffee, Vanilla Bean

Strangest flavor: [We have BBQ ice cream in Kansas City](https://www.kansascity.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/chow-town/article160536829.html). Not for me personally, too much going on."

63088,Best online React course,"One thing that bothered me about Maximilian's course was that he taught you old ways of doing things first, and those lectures felt dragged out.  


I took Brad Traversey's course, which essentially covered the ""footnotes"" versions of older React approaches, and dove straight into hooks by refactoring the few class-based components we built. SO good.   


TL : DR - Max S. is WAY thorough but the lectures bore. Brad T. is lighter on the lecture side but SO much more fun to follow along."
