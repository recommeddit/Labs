That was my plan with my local community college but at least half of the required classes aren't offered online for some reason.  I'll check some of the other colleges and see what they look like.
"Stuffed baked potato paratha is traditional for us . But you can stuff a lot of things in it. Spinach, cheese, garlic and much more."

"They're nice watches but use 5 dollar quartz movements. Aside from that they are all stainless steel/gold tone and acetate (plastic). They look good, but parts and materials considered, overpriced."
This is a conference where they teach (and sell equipment for) how to clone RFID cards.
I've got a black marauder. What do you have?
"I find it interesting over time they decided to swap spots between Rice and Brown. You’d think if Brady is 1, they’d both slide back 1 spot."
"Depends where you live, pharmacy chains tend to carry some samples, other than that big department stores, usually higher priced ones carry a fragrance department with testers, that's your best bet and where I usually go"
"""I hear that if you rub it, it grows bigger."""
"I had to fight to get IE10 support dropped at mine. Dropping IE11 was not an option since too many customers rely on it for ActiveX and enterprise features either not supported by Edge or the client's IT not willing to deal with learning and forcing everyone onto Edge.

Sadly, our bundled JS could be a fair bit smaller by getting rid of all of the transpiled syntax (i.e. leaving arrow functions in place, classes, etc) but it'll be years before that can happen."
"""Wear only enough cologne to be smelled in the arms of a lover. Wear enough aftershave to be smelled by no one, ever."""

Beats by Dre.....ok I can't even post that seriously.
"Only the best candy currently available to US markets

Santos was a legendary team that made up the core of those World Cup winning Brazilian teams. The league wasn't great but Pele definitely played for a team that had the quality of a European side. I agree though that he isn't the undisputed soccer GOAT
"At the various price points I would say:

Jansport,  fjallraven, topodesigns, goruck/missionworkshop

I'll throw TripleAughtDesign in there with Topo. Their ""scout"" pack has all the benifits of a small tactical pack while looking decidedly civilian and less like ""that guy that talks way too much about guns"".... I've been using their lightspeed for about 5 years. It's a bit more tacticool unfortunately (I have the molle-free tail on it so it's not so bad), but it was my school bag, and is now my dayhike bag, work bag, carryon, weighted ruck for working out, etc. still looks like new.... 10/10 would buy again."
"Aren’t those knockoff sunglasses even worse for your eyes than not wearing sunglasses at all? Read an article about that recently.. your pupils dilate because it’s “darker”, but they aren’t polarized so they’re taking in direct sun. 

If your goal is to look cool and like you own Raybans, I’m sure they’re fine. But if protecting your eyes is of any priority wearing sunglasses, you shouldn’t wear these. 

Edit: as others have pointed out, it’s that they aren’t 100% UV protection, not that they aren’t polarized. I didn’t remember the article correctly."
"Applied Math. I think the further I get into econ, the more I realize how applicable mathematical thinking is to everything."
"Warm musk, sweet natural florals, and a tad earthy. Hard to describe because it smells so different on everyone. But it smells so good on everyone too. 

I used to get mine at a local incense and oil shop but it closed down. If you’re looking to buy it, Auric Blends sells on Amazon for about $10. That’s been the closest to the one I’ve been buying, the oil is just not as thick."

"Also, it depends on the experience you want. All the dorms on campus are dorm style (sharing a bathroom for the whole floor) while FT has two rooms share one bathroom. Honestly, after seeing both, I preferred the dorm because 5 people sharing one bathroom can be too much."
Midnight Commander. Because Norton Commander was the first file manager i have ever used.
