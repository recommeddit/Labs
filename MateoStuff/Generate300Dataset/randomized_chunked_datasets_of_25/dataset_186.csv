They have lasted six years so far and have gone strong since. I will buy another pair without so much as a second thought the moment these fail. They are certainly not bass bumpers though, but the frequency response is stupidly high, and i can regularly hear tape hiss from CDs that were pressed in the 80s, which were basically analog to digital conversions.

32378,"I was on a Southwest Airplane late at night coming out of ABQ to LAX. This big guy ignored the entire empty plane, sat next to me (F, blond) and started chatting away. I figured he was a contractor or something of the kind. We had a grand time until people started to come to our row asking for his autograph. Confused I asked him who he was and what he did? He said his name was Steve. Said he was a wrestler. I said, ""Alligators""? And then I made a bad joke about speedos. He seemed embarrassed.

I had no idea who he was or why he might have people wanting his autograph. I have never followed wrestling. When we landed he walked me to the carousel, teased the heck out of me and wanted to drop me at my home in his limo. I declined.

We were walking to the curb together when my ride called. I, still joking around told her what was going on with my new best pal and she suddenly blurted out: STONE COLD STEVE AUSTiN?!! I turned around, cocked my head, squinted at him and asked him if the words ""Stone Cold"" meant anything to him? He started  making excuses about ""entertainment...yadda yadda yadda"". Yeah. Nicest guy ever. I had to look him up when I got home. Gave me a good laugh. My friend who picked me up from the plane never let me hear the end of it.",best hotel to live in

2. AC Milan  
3. Bayern Munchen  
4. Barcelona  
5. Ajax  
6. Liverpool  
7. Manchester United  
8. Juventus  
9. Inter  
10. Benfica  

Don't call me biased for being a United fan. I recognize Liverpool should be higher than United. I just can't agree on them being higher than Barcelona and Ajax. 

People love to say Ajax became irrelevant, but let's not act like Liverpool's fluke win in 2005 means they're more relevant. Especially considering how they're performing in the league. 

In my opinion, they're (considering Barcelona here too) big clubs not just for performances on the pitch, but also what they produced in terms of style of football. I think Ajax and Barcelona make a case far more than Liverpool do. 

This might be a bit morbid, but Liverpool's impact in negative ways should also kind of be considered. Looking at the history and seeing Liverpool being the cause for a 5 year ban for English clubs, to me that impacts their stance on this list. 

It makes me want to put Liverpool just below the top 5. Them wining 5 CL's, though, and the lost finals, it does put them ahead of United for me. That's more important from a ""Europe"" perspective, their one league they have over Liverpool makes it irrelevant and recently in Europe, it's hard to put United over Liverpool. 2005 and 2008 being close to each other, 2007 and 2009 as well, and then 2011 and 2018 of course. Cameo appearence from United in 2017 which shouldn't be completely ignored. This all against the argument that Liverpool have fallen off over the years.",best soccer team in the world
