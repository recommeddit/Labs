7896,best laptop for general use,I was looking in the $700-900 range and noticed that some of these are more expensive than their grouping. Am I looking in the wrong places?
56295,best action and adventure movie,"I've always thought this was a hard question to answer, so I eventually boiled it down to what sort of *experience* I had in the theater, when I first saw it. Pure adrenaline. Pure thrills. Had me just grinning from ear to ear. And that experience has only happened to me, at that level, maybe 3-4 times.

First was *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. Unsurprising.

That feeling happened to me again when I saw *Die Hard* for the first time. Only time I ever turned right around, bought a ticket and walked back in to see it again.

Third time was *The Mask of Zorro*. That turned it into a 3-way tie that lasted a very, very long time.

Recently, it happened with *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Mad Max: Fury Road*, so very high marks and honorable mention for each of them."
