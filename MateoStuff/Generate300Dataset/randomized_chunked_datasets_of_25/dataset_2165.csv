25758,best cricket teams of all time,I watched a little bit of their match yesterday against Sri Lanka and they were terrible in the field.
54038,best medicine for a cold,"Vitamin D.  The common cold is strongly associated with deficiencies of Vitamin D.  It takes a while to build up, so it isn't much good at first, but it can help you heal and avoid getting sick again."
72728,best wireless lightweight mouse,"GPX is impressive but clicks and stock feet suck, also shape is meh.

RVU has a better shape but i can't ever get used to the optical switches, even V2.

IMHO the best available right now is the Xenics Titan GX Air Wireless: great shape (S2 clone), great build, same weight as RVU and perfectly balanced, 3370, good stock feet (Arc2) and amazing clicks. I genuinely can't find a fault with this mouse"

6046,best Netflix documentary,"I also found Swami Pren Niren (the lawyer) to be fascinating.  Dude clearly put his greatest talents into his greatest passion and beliefs.  Arguably misguided, but undeniably respectable."

55498,best action and adventure novel series,"Curious, I've been interested in this series but always assumed it was mythology heavy?"
73348,best Linux distro,Do you think Endeavour would last for 4-5 years with a lot of updates to come?
20827,best workout music,"""Evictionaries"" by Trap Them.

Man, put that on and I feel like I can run through a brick wall and bench press a truck.  Unreal motivation!"
16251,best sunglasses for fashion,"Is there a reason why you don’t want to support Ray Ban? I’m a firm believer that I can’t wear “cheap” sunglasses as I’m in a country that’s 90% summer all year round. Whenever I wear fake sunglasses I get such bad headaches when I step out into the scorching sunlight. That being said, i have worn ray bans quite a lot because of their price to quality ratio that I like. However if there is a reason I should stop supporting them (poor ethical choices, bad business practices, etc) I would like to know! Thanks!!"
68690,best science fiction novel,"You read my mind! I was just thinking of what I could read in this genre that would take me away like PKD and Dune, or Ender's Game, etc. These are some good recommendations to go on, and I'll be looking into them for sure!

For you, OP, I would recommend the Silo Trilogy by Hugh Howey. A great post-apocalyptic world with lots of intriguing writing. Happy hunting!"
44245,best items under $100,"You don't even really need the slow-cooker. Steel cut oats brought to a boil and just left on the stove overnight without heat will slowly absorb the water and be ready for re-heating. 

Four cups water to every cup oats.

I like mine with a teaspoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of peanut butter per bowl just before eating."

30736,best country to live in,"It's about 3% of the number of people who actually voted, and while not a landslide, that's like saying the population of Chicago has no influence"
73058,best Linux distro,"Simple. RHEL is absolutely the only sensible choice. You could contemplate SLES, but outside of the HPC world, RHEL is almost always a better choice. I believe Canonical are offering support for Ubuntu these days, but I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot barge pole. They simply don't have the engineering resources to back it up. Red Hat and SUSE do."
