RVU has a better shape but i can't ever get used to the optical switches, even V2.

IMHO the best available right now is the Xenics Titan GX Air Wireless: great shape (S2 clone), great build, same weight as RVU and perfectly balanced, 3370, good stock feet (Arc2) and amazing clicks. I genuinely can't find a fault with this mouse",best wireless lightweight mouse

Whenever I wear fake sunglasses I get such bad headaches when I step out into the scorching sunlight. That being said, i have worn ray bans quite a lot because of their price to quality ratio that I like.
