56444,">Considering the price point I would expect to have 0 issues just like my LG CX in the living room 

I swapped a 55CX for a 32G7 and I gotta say, my CX had more issues than my G7.

Don't get me wrong, OLED blacks are amazing and perfect viewing angles with glossy 4k at 55"" is fantastic but... 240Hz is just so much better.

My G7 was also damn near a third of the price of my CX coming in at <$500 USD.",best desktop monitor

33554,"Charging speeds will be about 500km/h for the ID.4, 575km/h for the Standard Range Model Y, and about 700km/h for a Long Range Model Y on a v2 charger, and 900km/h on a v3. These are 10-80% averages, using EV Database figures, with the Model Y the same as Model 3 but downrated 5% for the reduced efficiency.

So the Model Y can charge at almost twice the speed, but only the model which costs a lot more, and only at v3 chargers.",best electric car

44456,"I want to strongly second this for anyone who hikes even occasionally (or does anything like field biology, which is me!). You should *always* have a headlamp with you. They take up next to no space/weight, and will literally save your life in an emergency situation, even if that ""emergency situation"" is just walking back to your car after dusk. 

I am unfortunately one degree removed from someone who ended up behind schedule on a hike, and was on her way back after dark. She fell off the trail and died, which likely would have been prevented if she could see the trail. Never, ever go into the field without a headlamp. You can get one for $20.",best items under $100
