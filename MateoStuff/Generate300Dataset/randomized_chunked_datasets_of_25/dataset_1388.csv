56444,best desktop monitor,">Considering the price point I would expect to have 0 issues just like my LG CX in the living room 

I swapped a 55CX for a 32G7 and I gotta say, my CX had more issues than my G7.

Don't get me wrong, OLED blacks are amazing and perfect viewing angles with glossy 4k at 55"" is fantastic but... 240Hz is just so much better.

My G7 was also damn near a third of the price of my CX coming in at <$500 USD."

33554,best electric car,"Charging speeds will be about 500km/h for the ID.4, 575km/h for the Standard Range Model Y, and about 700km/h for a Long Range Model Y on a v2 charger, and 900km/h on a v3. These are 10-80% averages, using EV Database figures, with the Model Y the same as Model 3 but downrated 5% for the reduced efficiency.

So the Model Y can charge at almost twice the speed, but only the model which costs a lot more, and only at v3 chargers."

44456,best items under $100,"I want to strongly second this for anyone who hikes even occasionally (or does anything like field biology, which is me!). You should *always* have a headlamp with you. They take up next to no space/weight, and will literally save your life in an emergency situation, even if that ""emergency situation"" is just walking back to your car after dusk. 

I am unfortunately one degree removed from someone who ended up behind schedule on a hike, and was on her way back after dark. She fell off the trail and died, which likely would have been prevented if she could see the trail. Never, ever go into the field without a headlamp. You can get one for $20."
33855,best Pokemon game,"Honestly there are way too many issues with gen one for me, nostalgia goggles came off with the virtual console release, however the remakes solved a lot of these problems and made the storyline much more enjoyable imo"

3570,best college for research,"Research faculty (some profs you like) and common data set. Also it's good to check out the overall ""feel"" of the campus/student body, for that I just used youtube."
19233,best YouTube video,There's another one on the bottom shelf.
73176,best Linux distro,"The important thing to understand is that it's fairly easy to hop between distros.  So don't sweat the choice much, and don't spend too much time trying to make a given distro do something its not good at.

That being saidâ€”start with Fedora.  It's sexier than Ubuntu."
39242,best web browser,Is it safe? Because my antivirus flags it as possibility dangerous
37968,best Marvel movie,"Thats because... they do have random critics review them. Critics review ALL movies, not just their interests. Why do you think that Iron Man has way less reviews then Endgame? Endgame is a bigger blockbuster so more critics who dont care about superheros will watch it simply to write a review"
57863,best cologne,"Picked out **Bvlgari Pour Homme** for my ex when we went shopping together at Sephora; I swear that stuff has got some mighty strong panty-repellent mixed into it. I couldn't keep off him when he had it on. I'd bury my face in his neck and breathe deep, wishing I could eat him up and swallow him whole."
65302,best phone service company,"Totally agree. I just ditched Googel Fi (after a few months) because even when I was on wifi at home, I was randomly getting charged for mobile data. 

Both Google support and an escalation supervisor said it does happen ""sometimes"". They had no recommendation other than manually disabling mobile data when at home or joined to other wifi and than re-enable when not."

53746,best medicine for a cold,"From a medical perspective that's probably one of the worst ways to go..

Alcohol before sleep destroys the quality (not quantity) of sleep, meaning that you'll only recover slower."

73424,best battery bank,"[It's](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-20100/A1271012) probably about the weight of a tablet, just sort of lives in my backpack when I'm traveling anywhere. I don't really charge it consistently but when it's empty I just leave it plugged in overnight and it'll be good."
