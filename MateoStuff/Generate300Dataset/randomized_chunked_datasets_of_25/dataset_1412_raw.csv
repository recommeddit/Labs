"That ending made me angry that they didn't wait, few films mess with me like that."
"ahh wore it in high school, good times"
"Good quality socks. 

Bedside reading lamp. 

Solar powered external phone battery. 

Emergency supply kit -- can be as simple as a MANUAL can opener and canned food, a few 2 liter soda bottles of water, and a crank flashlight/radio.

(Added:. Note that emergency canned food isn't something you buy and put on a shelf -- it's something you regularly eat that you buy a little *more* of, the new stuff goes in the back of the shelf and you eat the older stuff.  Canned tuna, canned beans, canned soup, things you can eat without cooking if the power goes out. )"
"I second this. If you actually need to talk to someone who has at least the slightest knowledge about hardware store stuff, Ace is 100x better than big box. At mine they actively greet everyone who enters and ask what they can help with. I’m usually in and out of there in a fraction of the time vs. HD wandering all over the place either trying to find stuff or trying to find someone who is willing to help me with a question."
"Well, Iran does have good universities. I bet there would be more in the Middle East if the rankings weren't based only on English\-language publications."
"Ranger, i'm just really used to the vim-like keybinds and it's really convenient to just have bookmarks or shortcuts to your mostly used folders, you can also assign scripts to keybinds so you can do pretty much everything with the files you selected with other CLI tools like ffmpeg or imagemagick.  

The most common criticism of Ranger it's the speed since it's written in Python, but it really doesn't bother me, i guess it can become annoying if you are using it on folders with thousands of files on a hard drive or something.  

I still have pcmanfm installed as a gui file manager but i barely use it.  

Funnily enough i find the Linux File managers to be more usable than the windows one which didn't even have tabs i think? Maybe that changes with Windows 11."
"berkeley - depressed, runs an anonymous blog where he/she writes poems and quotes edgar allen poe"
"The fact that that the top Outkast album is Speakerboxxx/Love Below and that ATLiens and Aquemini didn't make the list pretty much invalidates anything this list has to say about hip hop. Also, why is It Takes a Nation of Million always the top hip hop album on any rock critics' list of top albums?"
what's wrong with tim?
"You owe it to yourself to give Divinity Original Sin 2 a try. It doesn’t fit into what you’ve played before, but it has all of the elements you are looking for."
"Looks right to me.

Since 2010, SA has been going through a rebuilding phase with the ODI side. Losses both home and away.

It really is only over the last year and a half or so that SA has been stringing ODI performances together"
Wow almost all the ones you didn’t like I loved and the ones you liked I like them get into. I guess I won’t give you any recs
"everyone will have different opinions here. the blue is okay for me,but i only use it type in the office,it's too noisy,haha"
"Murdoch owns the Times, it is still however my favourite newspaper."
Just for time. I don’t have to keep it there.

"My mommy is a dentist, she says toothpaste brand doesn't matter but you should brush and floss 2 times every day and use a soft bristled toothbrush."
coke. lots of coke.
"Alton towers local here, wondering how well themed parks in the US are, any examples/averages?"
This is literally the only episode of the office that I laughed hysterically the entire episode.
"Ranger in the terminal, Thunar if I'm moving a lot of files, like copying images from my camera."
"That sounds amazing hahaha! I've heard about those morning bars. 

What's the price of a pint when you're out like that?"
"Nice, let me know what you think of it... I've watched it 4 or 5 times now and notice small things each time that I missed prior."
"Obvious NY sports beat bias here. Namath was NOT a great QB. Not on camera, not on the stat sheet. Super Bowl III was a monumental event in NFL history, and Namath gets way too much career cred for that one game."
And Angel!
