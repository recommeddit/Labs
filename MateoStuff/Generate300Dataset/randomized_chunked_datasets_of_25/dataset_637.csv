3693,"For France another important point was not mentioned earlier:
A lot of universities, graduate school or research institues have multiples campus with one official administrative headquarter in Paris. Some institutes ares ""network"" of universities. The heading of a french research paper could be really misleading regarding where the research took place. The actual name and place of the lab could be in the third or fourth position.  

For example, for my master thesis, the first name was Paristech, it is a network Parisian engineering school (Only one of them still have a campus inside Paris), the second name was the Paris head quarter of the school, third the name was the industrial partner, and fourth was the actual lab at a campus in the east of France.

The same happen in all field (CNRS, INRIA, EHESS).

This is done on propose. The small institutions could not get international visibility without regrouping. So now every institution in part of a network, federation, mother institution with a fancy Parisian adresse and all research seem to come from Paris.",best college for research
