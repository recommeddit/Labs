Just wishful thinking. But I didn't consider how the group's average could be dragged down.

"Very solid points you have made there mate like the way you have backed them up. And I can see what you mean. I suppose when your talking BEST albums the era argument will come into play most of the time, me personally also havent given enough time to new(er) hip hop, so I will cop that one on the chin as a fan."

"A few other suggestions I haven't seen mentioned:

Smash-up: This is a tongue-in-check card-based free-for-all battle. Mash up two genres like Zombies and Pirates to make your deck and then accumulate points to score bases.

Smallworlds: An area control game (a la Risk) but without the grind (there are a set number of turns). Fantasy races combine with unique modifiers to give each player different powers and abilities."
I've always been partial to [Context](http://www.contexteditor.org/index.php).
"If your colleagues have many features to implement and bugs to fix, migrating the request library might not justify as a prioritised task. Especially when it's a lot of effort that has no impact to the end user or business as a whole.

It's ok to keep using `request` in the foreseeable future. It doesn't have any vulnerabilities now, in fact [it didn't for a while](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/request), and it's unlikely to have one any time soon. It has plenty of features and gets the job done.

I wouldn't choose `request` when starting a new project, but for existing projects I'd consider the migration to a different library more of a nice-to-have task."
"Definitely, but it's also sometimes possible to see actual sediments in the water if it's from certain sources."
"I've honestly put probably around 500 hours into it (across having it on 360, One, and Pc) and I'm still loving it. I know it's not most people's favorite but I enjoy it very much. Not sure why I do but it is fun"
What does Vivaldi offer against chrome or opera?
I'm always on my cellphone so the small screen and tiny keyboard causes much backspacing because of old eyeballs and phat phingers.
"What sort of shows/movie genres do you like or what are some of your interests? This would help greatly in recommdations. What is it that you like about bleach? The animation style, characters, ghosts, swords, etc.?"
Any chance of having a look at your ranking algorithm? Am interested to see the moving parts.
"A head lamp. I never realized how useful these things were until I was given one. Think about it, when you actually need a flashlight, it's because you are in a situation were having both hand free is very useful. Also, you look in one direction and bam, the light is there."

"Best: when you get that two-pack of starburst and both of them are pink




Worst: when you get that two-pack of starbursts and they're both yellow"
"So the two story dorms - anacapa, santa cruz, santa rosa - have no singles or doubles this year because of the large freshman class. San Mig is all small doubles, and san nic has all 3 options. I dont know how it will be next year, but this year the class was so big that they had to do this on the three two story dorms. FT would have been the best bet this year if you were banking on a double tbh."

"Persona 5 for sure. The length of the game alone is worth it, it took me 70 hours to complete and i went through the game pretty fast. Great story, great characters, killer soundtrack and easily one of the most polished games of this generation."
LG gram 16 2021 is almost the perfect fit. Get the  LG gram 15 2020 if you really need it to be 15.6 inches.
