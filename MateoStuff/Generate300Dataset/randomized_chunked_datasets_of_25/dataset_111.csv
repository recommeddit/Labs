1-  goat cheese, fig, and honey- creamy, slightly salty, but sweet. like if cheesecake were part of the base but not actually mixed in as chunks, plus fig jam and honey swirled in. had this in seville spain

2-  creme caramel almond crunch - if you’ve seen the movie “up”, it features an ice cream shop based in the suburbs of san francisco and it’s real and has delicious ice cream.  swirls of buttery creme caramel and crunchy almond toffee in a vanilla base. 

3- pistachio. i had  the most delicious, rich, flavorful pistachio gelato in sienna italy. the pistachio flavor was so pronounced and yet the gelato was only slightly green. i can imagine it had to have pistachio butter as part of the base, aside from maybe oils? 

these are the flavors i want all the other flavors to taste like.",best ice cream flavor
