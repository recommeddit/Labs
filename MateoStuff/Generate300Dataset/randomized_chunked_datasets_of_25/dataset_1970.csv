43728,best items under $100,"I have 2 Victorinox knives, a chef's knife and a paring knife. $40 and $7 respectively, and I got a long honing steel for another $8.

I'd only ever used terrible or dull knives before. Using sharp knives and maintaining that sharpness has changed the way I cook. I'm far more confident and in control in the kitchen, and every time my boyfriend uses my knives he's jealous of how sharp they are."
54682,best water filter,"> safe to drink

Unless you're in Flint or have rusted pipes, tap water shouldn't be dangerous. For me, a water filter is about taste (our water is limey and the water softener doesn't remove everything), not safety."

4872,best home improvement store,"I agree with this so much. my local ace is great. 

Also on another topic with my local ace, they stock a specific local lawn care product line. A few times a year they have a rep from the company come and  answer questions. It's awesome."
53038,best hiphop album,"Hah, perfect timing, I just finished listening to it & I def agree. The Middle 4 is the weakest section to me & still good, “Brazil” & “Heaven”being the good ones; it starts and end great tho.  

I can’t pick favs yet, but if I had to pick 3, be “Late Night”, “Brazil”, & “Sincerely”.

I think if people enjoy SahBabii & could take just a bit more weird & a higher voice, then they’ll vibe w/ this pretty well."

65119,best phone service company,"From my experience and others local to me, yes they do.  But that could be because they're the #2 carrier here.  ATT is by far the worst locally but also the most widely used."
56576,best desktop monitor,I just wonder one thing : I already have a gsync 24 inch 1080p AOC monitor. I want to buy a second one to watch movies surf etc. Would you rather go for a larger sized 4k monitor or another 1080p IPS/TN panel? What is your thought? Would it be a problem if one is 144 hz and the other is 60 or 75 hz?

21967,best celebrity,"Can confirm, met him twice.
First time was a photo op at a convention, I guess I looked scared cause he asked if I was nervous. I stuttered out yes, and he put his arm around my waist for the photo and laughed cause I tensed up. Later when I got him to sign my bag he said ""moon of my life"" in Dothraki to me and I responded back with ""my sun and stars"". He said my Dothraki was good.

Second time was at the Aquaman premiere, he was thanking Australia for having him there and said we have a beautiful country. My best friend piped up, ""Ummm but I'm Canadian?"" And he gave her shit for being Canadian. All in good fun."
