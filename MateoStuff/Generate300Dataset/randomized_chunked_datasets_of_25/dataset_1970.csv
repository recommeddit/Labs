43728,"I have 2 Victorinox knives, a chef's knife and a paring knife. $40 and $7 respectively, and I got a long honing steel for another $8.

I'd only ever used terrible or dull knives before. Using sharp knives and maintaining that sharpness has changed the way I cook. I'm far more confident and in control in the kitchen, and every time my boyfriend uses my knives he's jealous of how sharp they are.",best items under $100

Unless you're in Flint or have rusted pipes, tap water shouldn't be dangerous. For me, a water filter is about taste (our water is limey and the water softener doesn't remove everything), not safety.",best water filter

First time was a photo op at a convention, I guess I looked scared cause he asked if I was nervous. I stuttered out yes, and he put his arm around my waist for the photo and laughed cause I tensed up. Later when I got him to sign my bag he said ""moon of my life"" in Dothraki to me and I responded back with ""my sun and stars"". He said my Dothraki was good.

Second time was at the Aquaman premiere, he was thanking Australia for having him there and said we have a beautiful country. My best friend piped up, ""Ummm but I'm Canadian?"" And he gave her shit for being Canadian. All in good fun.",best celebrity
