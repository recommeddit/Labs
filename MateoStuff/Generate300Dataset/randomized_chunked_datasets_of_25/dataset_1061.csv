39751,"[Fakespot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fakespot-analyze-fake-ama/nakplnnackehceedgkgkokbgbmfghain). Gives you an easy way to test the authenticity of reviews on Amazon (and a few other sites, not sure which). Edit: It can be used for free, the paid features just adds the fakespot grade on the page as you browse. Free opens a new tab.

[The Camelizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-camelizer/ghnomdcacenbmilgjigehppbamfndblo) (from camelcamelcamel) to easily check price history on Amazon, and set up price alerts

[Lastpass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd). I've had sites be hacked and my info stolen before, and had a bad habit of reusing passwords. Lastpass generates secure passwords and saves/autofills them. Unlike chrome's password saver, it's encrypted too, and with the app can be used cross-platform.
Edit: since a couple of people asked, I'll add that you can apparently import from chrome Password manager with lastpass (Account Options -> Advanced -> Import -> Google Chrome Password Manager).

~~Google translate. Allows you to quickly translate stuff/autotranslate pages.~~
Edit: some people have pointed out that chrome can autotranslate pages without the extension now, so I guess this one isn't needed.

[Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca) for a pretty new tab page.

[IE Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd). Basically turns the tab you use it on into a virtual internet explorer tab. I had something I used a while back that could only run in IE for whatever reason, so rather than subject myself to that I could just run IE Tab and it would work perfectly within chrome.
Edit: tested it and it will run stuff like Silverlight that Chrome won't. Fairly sure it essentially opens an instance of IE in a chrome tab somehow so everything works natively.

Also, this isn't an extension but I strongly recommend running your email through [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). It's a site that keeps a database of emails from website hacks and dataleaks and will tell you if your email was ever in one (and allow you to sign up for alerts for future ones). Obviously it's not foolproof and only has what the guy running it has managed to get his hands on but it's a really great tool! Goes hand in hand with lastpass imo.",best Chrome extensions

41075,"As a guitar player who transitioned over to bass for the sake of landing a spot in a gigging band, I find I enjoy practicing bass and performing much more than guitar. I feel like a part of the music a lot more, I really feel the groove and timing when playing bass in a way I never did when playing guitar. It makes me think I was playing the wrong instrument all this time :(
