"Likely 6 women October 2021. I want a beach resort to relax on the beach, swim in the ocean, and have access to things like snorkeling and jet skis etc."

"Civil Engineer here. I highly recommend it if it interests you. There are so many branches your career can take after college, depending on what fascinated you in classes.

I love construction, so I don't even have a P.E. (Professional Engineering) license but rather a G.C. (General Contracting) license. Day-to-day I don't do all that much I learned in school save for a few construction management-oriented classes, and utilizing the organizational and problem solving skills I developed in college and thereafter.

The degree will get your foot in the door for many different types of companies."
Yes definitely. My perfume fades on me. I try to mix with unscented lotion and put it on the specific points but it still doesn't stay as well. Mind you I live in South Florida so heat. I do have to say there was a girl in my previous department at work that smelled AMAZING no matter what perfume she had on. I had to go.up and.smell.her all the time lol. And she was fine with it bc she gets it a lot - so used to it! So I think it's also about your chemical makeup as well.
"I work with many mobile phones for many people spread out around LA.

Verizon has the best coverage.  There are a few nooks and cranny's (pacific palisades) where VZW is the only option.

T-mobile's coverage isn't bad, but is much cheaper than VZW.

AT&T - i hate they customer service with a vengeance.

Sprint - People use sprint?"

You've got me curious now...
It's probably just pennsylvanians googling to learn more about the planet mars as they are a naturally curious people
"I wasn't implying that at all.  I'm just wondering if this is the best medium to put it because it can become very disorganized very quickly.  Seems like a lot of work, too, only to be potentially buried in the comment section here."
Just what I was iso! Would you say these podcast are pg-13 school safe? I am looking for something I can put on in the background during our catch up days.
How'd you break into IB? Feel free to PM me. I'm not really interested in IB but it's always nice to know different paths people take.
"That's great! That's how it goes in web dev, too!"

"> Too many movies forget about the fun aspect and take themselves too seriously. 

The curse of the whole action movie genre."
Yes. Was too lazy to look up the name.
"Criminal minds. Itâ€™s more of an FBI investigation series and the format can be a little repetitive, but I still liked it"
Whiskey. Eagle Rare to be exact.
Appreciate the hard work! Thank you
"Why is the US the obvious? What about Europe? There you can have your fill of 5 thousand years of culture and history, a range of authentic cuisines, and with Nordic to Alpine to Mediterranean climates to choose from - oh, and get this ... universal healthcare with a higher life expectancy than the USA. Wherever you might choose, you would be within a day's drive of 6 or 7 different countries, cultures, histories, language and cuisine to explore.

I love the USA, but it is not the obvious IMO."
