"In all honesty, entered this post rdy to bash everything and baby rage at an awful list, still dont agree with the list but was very pleasantly surprised to see certain shows make it on this list.

Obligatory Cross Game is the best anime ever made comment, even though i objectively i know its not true and even i dont believe it but my love for the show makes me add this to my comment."

"In no particular order:

- Horizon Chase
- Graveyard Keeper
- Barbearian
- Dead Cells
- Swords of Ditto (really gotta push myself to finish this one)
- Kingdom: New Lands
- Crashlands
- Rogue Legacy
- Reigns (Lapse, Reigns: Her Majesty) - i'm ashamed how much I play these...
- Beat Cop
- hocus

Edit: Holy shit, forgot to mention

- BAD NORTH - gameplay and art style are pretty unique!

And some freebies to kill time when in a rush. 

Check them out. If you want, I can give you a bigger list but these stand out thr most for me from my library."

"This isn't related to the original question, but it's still scientific so here goes:

How significant is the difference between the water from the Millipore and the water that comes out of the deionized water taps in most labs?  Specifically, does the deionized water act as an electrolyte to a significantly greater extent?"
"Sorry I donâ€™t have much input for Asia or India. I really enjoyed The Breakers in Palm Beach Florida, and Iâ€™ve heard great things about Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, but I thought it relied more in its history than actually investing more in the property.

"1) 3-Gatsu no Lion: Beautiful.  Amazing art and production(Shaft).  Super relatable and likable MCs.  [Kawamoto girls are too precious](https://78.media.tumblr.com/7cc071f09a007d9516c7fc00a32e100e/tumblr_oo13156GfO1vlb6q0o1_500.gif)

2) Kekkai Sensen: Pure fun and coolness.  God-tier soundtrack with great animation, funny characters and an amazing setting.  Very good dub is also a plus.

3) Houseki no Kuni: Atmospheric.  The CGI is just unreal and the MC is super likable.

4-10, in no particular order)

Your Name: Great to look at with an engaging story.

Honey and Clover: Same author as 3-Gatsu.  Such a great coming of age/romance story.  All the characters are super relatable.  Only complaint is that it's pretty slow at first.

Cowboy Bebop: Absolute Classic.  Spike is one of the greatest anime characters of all time and anoth God-tier soundtrack.  Best dub.

Shirobako:  Gives us a look on how the shows we love so much are made.  [Cried like a b*tch at the end when](/s ""a certain someone got a job"")

New Game!!:  Like Shirobako but about video games with a little less drama and more moe.  All the characters are really fun to watch.

Shinseki Yori: really dark and spooky.  Very psychological.  Slow start though.

Kiki's Delivery Service: Nostalgic coming of age story.  Like all Ghibli movies the art and animation are on point, and the dub is very good."
"Lenny Kravitz was one of the most humble people I've met.  Incredibly down to earth, laid back and friendly.  

Prince Charles was also pretty friendly.  Would look you directly in the eye during conversation and make you feel like there was no one else in the world but the two of you - despite being constantly surrounded by others."
how about the privacy on it? does it also do the thing like google chrome or other browsers out there?
Chrome but I'm very unhappy with the fact that they have such a huge piece of the market share.

"budget isn't the problem, although the ultrawide is pretty much at my personal limit. It would have to be worth it though and I don't have a good way of testing it without taking the risk of just ordering one and sending it back if I don't like it. I'd like to avoid that though.



Graphics card will be upgraded with the monitor or earlier.


The S2716DG and PG279Q have pretty much the same specs, except the panel type. I'm not used to IPS panels so maybe I really should take advantage of that and go with the cheaper TN monitor :D    


I'm not cheaping out on 144Hz, 1440p and Gsync, so maybe I'll still regret not going with the IPS as well..."
