54356,best medicine for a cold,"Make tea. add juice of half a lemon, lots of raw honey, and a bit of fresh sliced ginger. Symptoms always disappear 50% faster for me than for my friends/coworkers because I use the good ole lemon tea method. I also get a good boost of energy from it, so if I am at home sick and I need to check in with work and answer emails or anything I'll drink the tea right before hand to clear my head. Works like a charm. It's important that the honey is raw, because processed honey loses a lot of its health benefits. If you can get local raw honey at the farmers market, drinking some tea with a tbs of local raw honey can also really help with seasonal allergies (again it has to be local). 

You can also make [SnakeJuice](http://themilkmanswife.blogspot.com/2009/02/homemade-couh-syrup.html) which tastes terrible but works even better than just lemon and honey."

38254,best newspapers to read,"The Economist is insanely biased. You Americans would probably call it libertarian. In general, the Economist promotes deregulation of everything: from marriage to business.

26769,best board games,"Aside of the fact that expansions give variety that is soon appreciated after playing base game for a few games, they also allow for more interesting combo's that are not present in the base game.
