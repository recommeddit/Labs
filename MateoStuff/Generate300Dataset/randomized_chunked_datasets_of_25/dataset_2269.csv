54356,"Make tea. add juice of half a lemon, lots of raw honey, and a bit of fresh sliced ginger. Symptoms always disappear 50% faster for me than for my friends/coworkers because I use the good ole lemon tea method. I also get a good boost of energy from it, so if I am at home sick and I need to check in with work and answer emails or anything I'll drink the tea right before hand to clear my head. Works like a charm. It's important that the honey is raw, because processed honey loses a lot of its health benefits. If you can get local raw honey at the farmers market, drinking some tea with a tbs of local raw honey can also really help with seasonal allergies (again it has to be local). 

You can also make [SnakeJuice](http://themilkmanswife.blogspot.com/2009/02/homemade-couh-syrup.html) which tastes terrible but works even better than just lemon and honey.",best medicine for a cold
