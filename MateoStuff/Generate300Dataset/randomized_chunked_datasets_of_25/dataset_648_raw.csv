"I used them as search topics. For example, if someone searched ""closest amusement park,"" the theme park that pops up on Google results would be considered a search topic.

That being said, I did forget to include Santa's Village in Vermont, and it is the most frequently occuring theme park search topic in that state, so you are correct. I actually have no idea how I got Great Escape, as even SFNE is slightly more popular in VT too."

How dare you leave out Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3.
You seem to like foods mixed together. Prison or Army?
A razor blade.

"Yeah, I remember Japan having terrific eggs. Remove the factory farmed bullshit and you're left with terrific food."
"Whatever pairs well with what I'm doing. 

Hot summer day? A nice frosty summer ale is in order. Fine steak dinner? Dark red wine please. Dessert? Bring me some port. Chilling on the lake with friends? Pass the jungle juice!"
Not seeing much love for Clipse!  Hell hath no fury is still a constant for me.  Brrrapbrap kakakakat!
