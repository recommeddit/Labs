36977,best roller coaster at six flags,"> Great Adventure — Better run than SFMM, but Nitro and El Toro cannot save a less-impressive ride profile. Not a fan of the layout.
> 

Agreed on the ""less-impressive ride profile."""
71109,best movies with a cool twist,ooooooh so good. I'm going to have to go back and watch for that it's been a minute since I've seen that one.
25918,best cricket teams of all time,I like how the last 5 decades all have different teams.
59342,best perfume,I don’t think I’ve ever really been complimented by men for perfume but women always love Alien by Thierry Mugluer. It is by far THE longest lasting perfume I’ve ever worn and gets better as time goes on. Definitely not office appropriate as it is really strong but it’s so good!
40263,best midrange CPU,"Seems like a decent idea for gaming, but you have to add the cost of a cooler, right? And it's probably sensible to wait for the new AMD lineup before buying right now"

2323,best headphones,Tell me you're joking.
40196,best midrange CPU,"I agree with most of your post. However, I think it's a bit misleading to say current gen 6 core cpus will be outdated soon whereas previous gen 8 cores will age gracefully.

It's not like 8 cores is a magic number which promises future proofing. I think to get an idea of how well a cpu ages it's a good idea to look at benchmarks which scale well in multithreaded scenarios, because I think the underlying assumption is that in the future applications/games will utilise higher core counts better.

The reason I say it's misleading is that a high performing 6 core like the r5 5600x is only around 10% behind the 3700x and 10700k in benchmarks that scale very well with cores like cinebench r20. So the multicore performance is much closer than if you just looked at the 33% higher core count of the 8 core models. https://www.techspot.com/review/2135-amd-ryzen-5600x/

Similarly the 5800x performs surprisingly closely to the 10900k in multithreaded benchmarks despite the 10900k having 25% more cores. (10850k and 10900k are awesome though with the good pricing they've had at times)"
30746,best country to live in,"Yeah, but we're so big population wise and we all do it so it's never a problem. I'll go my entire life not caring that the rest of the world is different and it won't cause me a single problem."

7362,best laptop for general use,"Hey there, I'm looking to upgrade from a laptop I bought in 2009 ( HP 15 inch screen with 128 gb storage). I'm looking for a good brand, with usb ports and all that jazz, a good webcam, and an average amount of storage. I'm not sure how much storage I need because I only use my laptop sparingly but I would rather have more than less. With how little I use a laptop, I am looking for a cheaper model around the 200-300 range. I also have terrible internet due to living in the country. What would your suggestion be for a non apple laptop?"
70343,best major to study in college,"Getting a masters in education after doing something unrelated is something a lot of my teachers in my public high school did. My chem teacher worked construction and my algebra teacher was in business. My father is an elementary school teacher now and he got his bachelors in CIS/accounting. We don't have a surplus of teachers in this country, and if you have a masters in education your expected pay range will go up even higher."

34150,best NFL player,">He wasn't really a deep threat as he wasn't very fast. He was a homerun threat because of his YAC ability no doubt.

Yes he was. His slow 40 time was because of a slow front 20. His top speed was really, really, fast."
