40196,"I agree with most of your post. However, I think it's a bit misleading to say current gen 6 core cpus will be outdated soon whereas previous gen 8 cores will age gracefully.

It's not like 8 cores is a magic number which promises future proofing. I think to get an idea of how well a cpu ages it's a good idea to look at benchmarks which scale well in multithreaded scenarios, because I think the underlying assumption is that in the future applications/games will utilise higher core counts better.

The reason I say it's misleading is that a high performing 6 core like the r5 5600x is only around 10% behind the 3700x and 10700k in benchmarks that scale very well with cores like cinebench r20. So the multicore performance is much closer than if you just looked at the 33% higher core count of the 8 core models. https://www.techspot.com/review/2135-amd-ryzen-5600x/

Similarly the 5800x performs surprisingly closely to the 10900k in multithreaded benchmarks despite the 10900k having 25% more cores. (10850k and 10900k are awesome though with the good pricing they've had at times)",best midrange CPU

I'm not sure how much storage I need because I only use my laptop sparingly but I would rather have more than less.
