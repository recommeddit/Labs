">Overall, this study demonstrates that long-term use of these two electric toothbrushes improves periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients, and that the Sonicare brush is superior to the Braun brush in reducing gingival inflammation and probing depth. Moreover, 6 months' use of Sonicare led to actual improvement in probing attachment levels of periodontal pockets.

Edit: Thanks for all the incredible feedback!
To clarify, I live in Austria, where the university system works a little bit differently. As soon as I enter university I will have to pick a specific focus, e.g. Macro/Microeconomics

"Yup I know. But that is kind of besides the point. All I meant was that there are occasionally good deals to be had here. Granted, not as many as our Southern neighbours get. :P"

"Busy P, Boys Noize, and MSTRKRFT are the only ones with similar sound, and even then aren't that similar. (Haven't heard Mylo, will check it out) 

I personally thought Around the World was the best, but I prefer to listen to Rollin and Scratchin more regularly. 

And yes, I do understand the references on Teachers, and knowing those artists help you figure out homework wasn't that innovative, just a combination of those artists made more poppy."
Uh it also has interceptors and a slew of other features. It’s not just a single function.
Yep. That’s exactly what I was saying.  Cheers!
"Haha, yeah, it took me ages as well to get back into reading ""normal"" books, where the story/plot/narrative is all you've got. 

Wolfe is so multi-layered that most other fiction seems so very simple afterwards.

I've not really found anything else like it. David Mitchell is pretty good but in a different way. Hannu Rajaniemi is also excellent, and has that multi layered complexity. But neither are actually very similar, or repay in the same way the rereads Wolfe does. 

Vance though shows where Wolfe came from, and his language shaped Wolfe's for sure. Look for the word ""oubliette"" in Vance, then see the way other authors in this tradition use it as well. If oubliette is in a speculative fiction novel, the you're almost certainly reading a Vance and Wolfe fan."
