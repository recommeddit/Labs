You can thank the [RYM Forum](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/YasashiiDia/top-anime-series-as-voted-for-by-rym/).  They voted NHK the 10th best anime.  (it was on other lists too, but the RYM Forum certainly helped)"

32681,best vacation resort,"I know which Club you're talking about. It keeps coming up, but it's actually 2 miles from ocean beach.

I've been looking at San Diego and Georgia as well. It seems like all-inclusive doesn't really apply to many places here, and I'm a little curious as to why...

Edit: There are health issues keeping us in the Continental US."
33452,best electric car,"Supposed to. That is my point. Supposed. Rivian was supposed to come out this year. Almost all of these were supposed to come out this year, or even before. But, semantics, I guess"

30856,best country to live in,"Exactly! People relocate to other countries all the time- but have you ever heard of a North Korean moving? No! The government also does really awesome things. Say for example, your father committed a terrible crime like saying something negative about the Leader in passing to a friend. He would be put to death. While you'd be mortified about the crime he committed, you'd also really miss him. The government will not only kill him, but kill generations of your family as well! That way you will never have to be embarrassed about his crimes, or go through the pain of missing dad! They're always thinking of their citizens!"

26460,best politician,"Off the top of my head, some of the most prominent politicians in the US are Hispanic. Ted Cruz is top dog politician of Texas, possible candidate for presidency (but not born in the US so let's see how that turns out). Here in Florida, Marco Rubio is the top dog for the Republicans in the state. The governors of New Mexico have been Latinos since probably forever, Nevada has a Hispanic governor, Florida had one, it wouldn't surprise me if Texas, California, Arizona, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, or Illinois had Hispanic governors. There's one in the Supreme Court. The Treasurer of the United States has been a women of Mexican descent 3 times in a row. There's probably more but I can't think of many off the top of my head. I should probably check some state, brb.

Edit: I was mistaken about the New Mexico thing. Only the last two governors were Hispanics (both Republican). Interesting since New Mexico is the only state where Hispanics outnumber non-Hispanic whites. California none within the past century, Texas, none that I see, Florida has that one guy from the late 80s (also R), Nevada that guy still incumbent (also Republican), Arizona 1 from a long time ago, no one else that I know of. Let's check the House: [36 Hispanics](http://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/demographics/hispanic-americans) for 8% (Latino population is twice this). Although it does kind of make sense since to get into Congress, one usually had to climb up the ladder and have experience, aka they're old and Hispancs made up a smaller percentage of the population back then. The average age of Congress is [60](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-CONGRESS_AGES_1009.html), more or less between both parties and in both chambers.  60 years ago was 1955, where Hispanics were around 2%-3%. But then again, most Hispanics are probably young, just guessing, so make of this what you will.

Here's the list of every Hispanic congressperson ever (excluding local Peurto Rican politicians, for obvious reasons): http://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans_in_the_United_States_Congress"
55268,best places to hike in the east coast,"Catskill mountains do have some nice trails but generally are shorter. You could always combine a few trails like the devils path. But nothing over 25 miles that I am aware of. There must be though, with some research. The STS is an 80 mile trail. The BFT is 42 miles. Or you could go down to Shenandoah and hike old rag mountain."
44370,best items under $100,"=( if you get one don't use it like a normal toothbrush and brush back and forth with it.  My dental hygienist explained that i was causing permanent scratches on the enamel and was causing my gums to recede permanently.  Lovely.

Edit:  To further elaborate, she told me to just put the toothbrush against my teeth and let it do its work.  The only work I should be doing is just placing the toothbrush head in the right locations."

10897,best suitcase lock,"What?

Am I missing something? 

The TSA can look in whatever bag they want, that's why we can't use padlocks anymore. 

What's the point of this?"
