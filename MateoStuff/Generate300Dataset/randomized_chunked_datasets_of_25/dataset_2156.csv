38728,best newspapers to read,"I buy the Economist and read the Telegraph, Guardian and BBC news online, which I take as giving me a decent enough aggregate of current affairs independent of the bias that each paper and the beeb has.

37980,best Marvel movie,"Seeing it in theatres when it came out was really a jaw-dropping experience. I was a big fan of the MCU before CA:TWS and thought they were great superhero movies, but with this one it was a great superhero movie AND a great movie.

 I really liked CA:TFA and became a big Cap fan from that and from The Avengers, but TWS really dived into Cap's character more. And the fight scenes were phenomenal. I really liked how they were just regular people (albeit supersoldiers, former assassins, or former military) without magic powers fighting each other physically.

Plus I liked Bucky's character a lot in TFA, so seeing him come back in TWS with more complexity to his character was amazing. That reveal at the end of the highway fight scene absolutely floored me."

46915,best hand santizer brand,"Dentist here. Just to clear up the misconception that the alcohol on listerine is the antiseptic. It's used at low ~20% to dissolve the essential oils. Listerine is an essential oil mouthrinse. It's those that give the burning sensation. Just like menthol gives you a cooling sensation. You need a way higher alcohol percent to act as disinfectant, much higher than listerine has."
