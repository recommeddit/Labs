37980,"Seeing it in theatres when it came out was really a jaw-dropping experience. I was a big fan of the MCU before CA:TWS and thought they were great superhero movies, but with this one it was a great superhero movie AND a great movie.

 I really liked CA:TFA and became a big Cap fan from that and from The Avengers, but TWS really dived into Cap's character more. And the fight scenes were phenomenal. I really liked how they were just regular people (albeit supersoldiers, former assassins, or former military) without magic powers fighting each other physically.

Plus I liked Bucky's character a lot in TFA, so seeing him come back in TWS with more complexity to his character was amazing. That reveal at the end of the highway fight scene absolutely floored me.",best Marvel movie

Listerine is an essential oil mouthrinse. It's those that give the burning sensation. Just like menthol gives you a cooling sensation.
