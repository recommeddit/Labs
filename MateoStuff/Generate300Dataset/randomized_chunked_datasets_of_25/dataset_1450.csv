31886,best hotel to live in,"We did something very similar in Da Lat, Vietnam.  Everything is negotiable in person.  Not sure if they'd do that online, but a ""no"" won't kill you.

BTW, we really liked Da Nang. Plenty big enough for us, and had a very positive feel.  Bonus: we stumbled on the Asian Beach Games while we were there.  Great fun on China Beach."
48178,best color to paint with,"One caution on that though if someone is very particular on the color that they are using.

Most samples are going to be sold in a single sheen (generally satin) so if you change to a different sheen the shade will look slightly different. They try to adjust it, but matte and gloss *will* look different.

Also, posterboard has a very different texture than most walls, so again the accuracy won't be perfect.

Not to say that your method wouldn't work, but I've sold paint for a year or so and these are both common problems that turn into major headaches for someone who is *very* particular."
63875,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"Myanonamouse as far as I remember, do they still have the VIP system though?"
1693,best ice cream flavor,French vanilla specifically. It's so creamy.
38727,best newspapers to read,"It depends on whom exactly you talk to because print media has political bias, but generally The Guardian, The Financial Times, The Times, The Telegraph and possibly The Independent are considered good sources of news by the political classes. The same classes would tell you that the Daily Mail has a very bad reputation."
912,best desk lamp,"That lamp doesn't look like $170 worth of lamp to me.  It looks like about $40 worth of lamp.  
Lamps don't really need to be particularly durable.  Anything with half decent hinges and joints that are wood or metal should be sufficient.  
Simple CFL lamps will be more reliable, since the ballasts are built in to the lamp.  LED lamps have the ballast built in to the lamp, so if the ballast dies the lamp is useless. (Ask me how I know).  
On top of that, you are limited to the color temperatures that the manufacturer provides - you can't replace the LEDs easily.  If you don't like the color of the CFL, you just buy a different one.  
LEDs will also tend to have a more narrow throw than CFLs, even with wide angle lenses.  
I'd just start [here](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/workspaces/20502/) (Yeah, it's ikea - but they make decent enough CFL lamps with a great selection, and it's not like they make lamps out of particleboard) and pick something with a solid classic lamp design and CFLs.  
I have [this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20370383/) one and it's great.  Clamps to my desk behind my LCD and comes right over the top of it.  
There's no reason BIFL needs to equal the most expensive option.  
EDIT:  You can also switch out the CFL to higher or lower wattage to adjust your brightness.  \
EDIT:  Disagree with an ikea recommendation all you want, but the CFL info is solid purchasing advice."
1262,best ice cream flavor,I love many ice creams but when in doubt cookies n cream
47697,best state to visit in the United States,"Georgia.

I would recommend [Providence Canyon State Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_Canyon_State_Park), AKA Georgia's Little Grand Canyon.

For the Atlanta area, I would recommend the World of Coke and National Center for Civil and Human Rights."
59036,best perfume,Hah Womanity did the same to me. Takes a bit doesn't it!
23448,best car racing video game,"I don't think I'll ever have the experience of playing NFSU again.

The first one in a crappy computer, later the second NFSU on a PS2.

Such a great and fun experience, exploring the city, getting better parts, better cars. I never was a car guy so I just went ""this one is more expensive so its better"" but I had a blast making cool cars and the sense of progression was awesome.

I'd pay to have the old NFSU2 as a remake but unfortunately we're stuck with shitty lootboxes from EA."
68105,best science fiction novel,"I can't remember where, but I remember hearing that the sequels to Dune were not great. Have you read them, and what is your take?"
53487,best medicine for a cold,Water - Lots of water. Also a product with Pseudoephedrine as an ingredient.
42550,best detective show,My wife just finished it (I watched the first two episodes and liked it...she just has more time).  She loves it.  It made me not ever want to go to the doctor again.
33388,best electric car,Hyundai Ioniq. CCS and man that thing is efficient!!
61570,Best RPG game on PS4,As opposed to something like TW3 where you're a predefined character. Where's the role playing in that?
67085,best places to skydive in california,"Ok thanks. If that's the case, I might just stick with the Oceanside one since it gets really good reviews."

20120,best workout music,Definitely feel that one the next day.
61342,Best RPG game on PS4,Ill watch some videos on it right after I finish this ghost of tsushima video.
65272,best phone service company,"It ***would*** make sense to have that ""Estimated Total Price"" column right next to the price column since that column is actually what I care about the most. The fees between different services are so disparate. Some charge no extra fees and some charge like $6 or $7 extra per month!

P.S. Thanks for all the hard work on that spreadsheet. You've done a remarkable job!"
57802,best cologne,Invictus by Paco Rabane
14414,best romantic novel,"No, that’s such a lovely name! She’ll totally love you for it. And I completely agree. I’ve always liked names where you can make multiple nicknames out of it. I’ve always loved the intimacy of people you’re really close to calling you by a shortened version of your name."
23235,best social networking site for CS,"As a software developer, who is your intended audience?

Do you run a consultancy, selling your engineering services?

Are you more interested in being followed by other engineers?

----

If you're interested in **selling your software development services**... your audience would not necessarily be devs...

It's just logical that they're not engineers. 

What do they want to hear from you?

- Benefits from great engineering
- Why they should update their website
- Why building an app would be useful to their business
- How to hire the best software developer

----

If you're interested in being an **engineering thought leader**, that's very different.

You might just be establishing your authority or looking to attract other engineers to hire. 

In which case, your topics would be along the lines of:

- How the latest WWDC announcements affect your work
- How to manage your stakeholders as an engineer
- The latest & greatest frameworks

----

It all boils down to your audience.

It happens that your two choices (buyers or fellow developers) speak very different languages."
57309,best water brand,"Add aquafina, pretty sure this brand and dasani are Mlt public water system with even more  treatment to be sure it would taste even more like sewer."
