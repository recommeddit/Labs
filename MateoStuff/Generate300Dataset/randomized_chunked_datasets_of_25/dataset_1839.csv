15997,best sunglasses for fashion,"I have got a pair of prescription ones that I've not broken in yet (UK weather). 

My most used pair are cheap Primark ones that look like Celine sunglasses (the sort of cat eye ones), which I am lusting after. I do tend to go for the classics - I've got some cheap aviator sunglasses (thin gold frame) and RayBan wayfarers. But generally, I'll buy them from the high street shops as they have UV protection."

30158,best Mexican war to study,"Adding on to what bosworth said alot of it has to due with the motives.

It's especially hard for me, now that I am a parent, to go out and do things as often as I used to.

It's good to switch things up every now and then."
