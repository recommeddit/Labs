42680,best detective show,"Thereâ€™s a French one, I believe itâ€™s called The Frozen Dead (GlacÃ©)... and another called The Chalet which I enjoyed"
32711,best vacation resort,"I really don't understand why you'd go to one. You're essentially trapping yourself on one complex. Half the fun of being on holiday is finding new bars and restaurants. I don't see how it's a hassle. Plus, if you don't really like your hotel, you're pretty fucked because you've already paid for everything. I really don't like the buffet meal service either. I'd much prefer to have a freshly cooked meal brought over by a waiter than piling some cold pasta onto my plate."
9265,best toothpaste,Chewing tobacco and a wire brush. Business is slow.
30725,best country to live in,"Canada and the US rank 9 and 10 on the HDI. That's a pretty good indicator of living standards in a country. We are not #1. Close, but not the best."

61890,Best RPG game on PS4,"Try to immerse yourself more into the game. Read some books in the game. Every location is unique with its own story. In skyrim you can be any kind of warrior you want to be and change whenever u want. Hundreds of hours full of quests and so much lore! The witcher is more polished and is a lot bigger, but skyrim is just more hardcore."
60878,Best comedy show on Netflix,Peep show is perfect at times and very odd and not to my liking at times. But the parts that were funny were so poignant or grating at the same time that they were true comedy gold. So unique.
4870,best home improvement store,I love my ACE!
1556,best ice cream flavor,I've heard of this!! And heard the same - that it was actually very good. Was it spicy at all?

25307,best spiderman actor,"Peter Parker: Tom Holland

Spider-man: Tom Holland

Love Interest: Emma Stone, but I think Zendaya has the potential to take the crown. 

Aunt May: Marissa Tomei

Best Friend: Ned

Flash: ASM

Uncle Ben: Raimi

Story: SM2, but I find ASM to be the one I rewatch most. 

Overall, I like the MCU casting the most but find the plot of Homecoming a little underwhelming compared to SM2 and ASM."

5240,best home improvement store,i spend too much time on this site... and i still suck at communicating this shit. :)
5294,best home improvement store,"similar site shopgoodwill.com

its basically just stuff that gets donated to goodwill that is actually worth something (usually)"
6001,best programming language for web development,"Where I live, most employers are looking for people with skills in:

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery/Angular/React

and either:

* C#, ASP.Net MVC and Entity Framework
* SQL Server

or:

* PHP
* MySQL

Honestly I'd say the best thing to do is to look for jobs in your area and see what employers where you are want. Maybe make a tally for each language or something."

29155,best calendar tool,"There are very few to-do list apps that really have that daily scheduling approach. Most just create a ""today"" list based on whatever is DUE today. Which to me doesn't make sense as I only want to add due dates to things that have a hard deadline. And recurring tasks are also a mess in those systems as they just go on the list again with a due date for the day you want to DO them on. I created an application (Amazing Marvin) that does let you schedule tasks into days. So you have due dates and do dates. It's kind of like a zoomed out calendar and to-do list in one. A real calendar beyond the daily lists is being added soon to."

38316,best newspapers to read,"Not exactly a newspaper, but you canâ€™t go wrong with The Economist."
572,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"its not really necessary to have a tablet close to the size of your screen. The [Intuos M](https://us-store.wacom.com/Catalog/Pen-Tablets/wacom-intuos/wacom-intuos-m-bt#/undefined1) sounds like in your range.

The intuos Pros start at $380, so youd have to find a used one if you want one of those for under $200."
38710,best newspapers to read,"I'm not even an avid newspaper reader, but I can tell you for sure that the Daily Mail has a reputation for being racist and unreliable."
