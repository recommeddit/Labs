69576,best major to study in college,"Was looking for this. I can not tell you how many people major in a language (without study abroad) and think they are going to be able to move to that country and work there.

I did German and Linguistics (double major) and am doing my masters in Germany with the intention of teaching English as a Second Language. Some of my friends just majored in French or German and planned on moving over here and getting any kind of job."

2386,best headphones,"I truly recommend the bose qc35ii , they sound great for most audiophiles and in my opinion they are equally or better sounding than the senheisser , I think bose has much better neutral sound overall in my opinion , also they are the most comfortable  ( one of most important things when listening through headphones ) also the anc is stellar and class leading , I can't recomend the sony wh-1000xm3 because I didn't tried them but they're also amazing , I personally have the bose qc35ii and sony wf-1000xm3 , bose - brand new replacement coming soon , sony wf-1000xm3 - repair coming soon , the sony wf-1000xm3 are the best earbuds I ever used , they have top notch anc and impressive sound for their price , they're truly worth it as well , a companion for your high-end headphones"

33469,best electric car,"Who in the hell would buy a $110k truck from a manufacturer that has zero knowledge/experience?

These are all nothing by HALO cars, but at the end of the day, they are too expensive to make any kind of market impact.

The Tesla approaches a reasonable price, but it's not going to be available until late 2022."
11921,best gifts for dad,"Fire TV Stick. Side load it with Kodi

62177,Best RPG game on PS4,"Just to give you an idea of how creepy it can be. It's worth mentioning that I'm on my second playthrough, and I still find encounters I had never seen before. Story time.

So I'm riding my all black American standard through the swamp lands, there's a heavy fog as night draws in. I cross a narrow wooden bridge and my horse gets spooked and throws me. As I stand up I see a dead horse in an old wagon. the fog is so thick and I'm calling for my horse but it isn't coming, so I knew something had went wrong. I draw my pistol expecting the worst. When I find my horse there's a creepy looking man standing by her so I line up my shot and peel his cap back. As I do, I notice a red Dot on my map, another guy tackles me to the ground. Luckily I break free and finish him off. Get on my horse and away I went. 

Sorry for the text wall. This is one of the only games where I can just be playing normally and something random happens that I'd never expect. Absolutely recommend."
