12081,best gifts for dad,I know it sounds crass but that would actually be a pretty sweet gift.  Time is the only thing that truly has value.  The time to be himself without outside responsibility is golden.
11440,best gifts for dad,Thank you kind human
37136,best amusement park,I would agree that Cedar Point's operations are not what they're cracked up to be but they are usually running the correct number of trains unlike Magic Mountain who can barely manage to keep one operational train operational. And in terms of a direct comparison between coaster Cedar Point wins almost all of them and it's not close.

70528,best major to study in college,"Broadcast Journalism

Best: my school has one, soon to be two, TV studios where we can get experience right away either as talent or in the control room

Worst: it's so so so much work especially for reporting. Finding an interesting story with an interesting angle, to setting up/coordinating interviews, getting good sound bites (especially if the interviewee is as dry as an Arizona summer), to the absolute worst part, editing. A good 45 second to 1 minute story can take as long as 3 hours alone to edit."
