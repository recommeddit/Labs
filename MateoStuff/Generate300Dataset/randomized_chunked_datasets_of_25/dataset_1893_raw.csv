Try a Coach outlet store if you haven't already.
">A 10 foot charging cable 

Only if of God quality. Otherwise it might lose enough voltage over is length for the phone to not charge. Been there done that.

I was going to post this same bag.  I've had mine for going on 5 years now.  Still great.  That steel cable running through the handle is terrific.
"Thanks, this is very useful."
Earliest on that is the 26th for the clear. The other suggestion of going through the carrier seems to be the better option. Verizon has the clear Apple case for $30 right now too instead of the $40 they charge at the apple store.
I'm 37 and Apricot Brandy Sour is  my all time favorite. Love the mix of sweet and sour. Have fun!

"Very true. But if it drops below 70 at night, I always bring a sweater. I’m glad to be out of the northeast now, where I don’t have to carry a sweater with me year round, “just in case the sun goes down”"

I always spray behind my ear so that when you're in clubs and someone leans in to talk they get a pleasant whiff."
"Just a reminder to spend much, much time with them."
A little shocked you didn't pick wind waker for GameCube choice. No shame in metroid prime though. That game is absolutely amazing.
These are all so good. I’ve never heard of Chloe Liese. Can’t wait to check it out.
"Better Than Us should be on the list. Even though it's not English and kind of sci Fi, it does fit in as a crime drama as far as I'm concerned and I really enjoyed it."
"Villa won the European Cup, CL’s predecessor. They also won the league more times."
