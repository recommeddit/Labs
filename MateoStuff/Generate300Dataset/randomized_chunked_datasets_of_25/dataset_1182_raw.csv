This is quite opposite of the dad that just wants to have lunch with his kid.
"Floss *twice* daily? 

What food is getting trapped in my teeth between my going to sleep and waking up?"
Came to that conclusion too after my Dell ultrasharp U2412M has been with me since 2013. Got from gtx770 to gtx 1660ti and now Rtx 3070 it was about time. Since LG is coming with a new GP27850 the older LG 27GL850 is on sale. My old Dell uses an LG IPS display but it's lightyears behind my new monitor.
I watched the Jurassic Park version of this before the original and didn't understand what on earth was going on.
"AFUtD is a great example of what I love in SF - just read it again recently.  It's more of a direct adventure story but it's a lot of fun. So hard to pick ""top 3"" because it varies with my mood.

Among the top ones, today, and which list will be different tomorrow:

1. A Fire Upon the Deep (per above)
2. Enders Game (just holds up well as a re-read)
3. Cryptonomicon (which has the density I crave, even though it's often more historical than futuristic).

Though I'd be tempted to include Dune as well but didn't want to copy your list.  Anthologies won't make the cut of course even though Dangerous Visions deserves to be in there.  Pynchon is maybe too literary but Gravity's Rainbow deserves a mention."
Was it an accidental reset?
Oh hell yeah. I personally think Fury Road is the best movie so far this century and easily assign GOAT status to Seven Samurai.
"This list feels off because arch has such amazing documentation, I started using the arch docs before I was ever able to install arch."
"P100D is larger and heavier than a P3D, they're different beasts."
Gone girl.
"Hehe, you said ""euphemism"""
"I can only speak from my own experience, but I've noticed folks who don't game much love the engine building and the theme. It's easier for them to get around the fiddliness for an exciting theme and that constant feeling of progress. Wheras dry, point-salady Euros can be VERY hit or miss (and I do love me some dry, point-salady Euros).

7 Wonders Duel could work well, though."

"Mixed drink, Mojito. A little sweet, a little sour, a little herby, a little boozey.

Beer, Pilsners are easy to drink and go well with fatty, savory foods like wings, BBQ, fries or bar snacks.

Wine, Riesling is a sweet to semi-dry white wine know for being pleasant and easy to drink. 

Since it's your 21st, I'd like to recommend tastings and tours of craft distilleries, breweries, wineries, etc if that's an option where you live. Distilleries generally serve unique cocktails if small servings of straight liquor isn't your thing. A brewery tasting lets you try a wide variety of beer styles, and the staff are often VERY knowledgeable and can help you find a beer that's right for you. Winery tours and tastings are more of a summer and fall thing, but they can also help you narrow down your wine palette so you know what styles to buy at the store."
"For their population, that's very impressive for Croatia and Serbia"
I feel like the other commentators are trying so hard not to laugh
It's whatcha hearin'!
"I'm happy to help, let me know if I can help with anything else."
"There’s like 3 different variations of the Acer swift x, which would you recommend for me?"
"Red cedar. There is something so comforting about them, plus they make beautiful furniture."
"Been to: SFNE, LR, Sfgadv, SFGAm, SFOG, SFFT, SFA, Six Flags Ohio, TGE, and SFMM.  I think Six Flags Ohio was the best, it was run the best and I had the best time there. Since that park is gone, I'll go with Six Flags Fiesta Texas. It was the least Six Flags feeling park. It has personality and felt... cared for? Well aside from where Pandemonium is, that felt straight up Six Flags and kind of just placed without much thought."

I bought a phone charger that is more than twice my height in length by mistake & at first I thought it was really goofy and was gonna return it but it’s actually awesome & I’m never going back to short cords!
Weird finding another CHester A. Arthur fan out in the world.
"Here's one taken from the opposite end. I'm really bad at rolling joints. I left the shitty joint with my stash and papers on the dresser. I come back to a nicely rolled joint. I don't know if any was missing .

But thank you Hard Rock LV staff."
