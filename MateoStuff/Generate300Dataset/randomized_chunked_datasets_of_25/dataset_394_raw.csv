Does Canada have a different prime day? In the US I thought it was like July-ish
We were at a baseball game for my little brother and sitting in an area designated for her to be able to lay in the shade and not be in the stands.
Oh my god this happened at my Home Depot too except the giant dog peed a 1 gal puddle in the middle of an aisle.
"> It smells like lemon fresh when you put it on and I didn't see the appeal, but when the initial smell goes away and you forget about it, men and women both really like the smell although I have no idea if it smells like Aventus.

It's very close. Aventus has a stronger pineapple on the opening compared to CDNIM's blast of artificial lemon, but within half an hour they're really difficult to tell apart unless you're smelling them next to each other."
So typical.
"They work well?  Ever had your water tested, like plain tap vs berkey water?  

I really want to get one."
this is my favourite thread
"I find it not that hard to believe because I've heard even other stories of Kendall being really rude to staff in a restaurant, and being really rude to basically everyone who isn't her ""squad""

I also read a twitter thread where she insulted someone's appearance when they came up to her for something so there's that."
I laugh so hard every time I watch this.
"Generally is is very user specific. When I say it works out of the box, I mean that 99% of people want it to block ads they see on the screen and it does that at the flip of a switch. The settings allow a user to go very in-depth, tweaking detailed technical elements to block specific scripts or analytics or trackers. Most people have zero desire to do so. I tried for a few minutes to find a thread that detailed some of those changes one can choose to make, but couldn't find it. [https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki) has info on it in a less step-by-step presentation."
"It's also great, but much different in tone. I loved them both, but the first has a special place in my heart. The ending of Ruin makes me excited for the sequel though."
Excellent idea!!! Thank you!
Johnny Depp likes to dress up as Captain Jack Sparrow and go to hospitals. One time he just strolled onto the pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney Land and just stood there chilling and chatted to the guests while in character. People lost their shit.
i am a violinist i can confirm its accurate
"Piranesi sounds good, what are your opinions, sadly I didnt get into Johnathan strange and mr norrel it felt.....not sure if dry is the word but overly explainy. At least the beginning bits that I just couldnt get past)"
Getting ready to can my first big batch when we cull chickens this year.  I'll have at least 15 birds that will become dinner.  What is your stock recipe?  FWIW I have a 30qt pressure cooker.
"Absolutely. Tobey is the best actor in the best Spider-Man movie with the best Peter Parker characterization.

Andrew Garfield is probably a good actor, but was in two absolute garbage movies and played a douchebag Peter Parker.

I like this new kid."
"Not music, but this really motivates me -

Don't like it? Good."
Mullvad or Windscribe. Nothing else comes close.
"There are two parts to this question.

First, sanitizer probably will kill all germs; the 99.99% is given to err on the side of caution, to prevent people from suing ""hey, I found 2 still living germs out of the billions I started with, you are making false promises"" (and proving that those 2 germs were due to contaminated sample or the sanitizer was not used properly is difficult).

Second, AFAIK it's impossible to be immune against the alcohols used in sanitizers; there's too much of it so that even a slight immunity would not be enough; all biological processes would probably have to change to be immune.

The same way biological systems cannot develop immunity against fire or strong acids/bases, they cannot develop immunity against sanitizers."
"Versatile actor is not equivalent to a student who gets 70 for each subject. Versatile actor can be compared to a student who gets 90-95(preferably 100) in most(if not all) the subjects he attempts. Good actors usually have long careers. Even if the career lasts for only 10 years, if all roles look similar, it won't reflect on the actor a good manner."
"""Who's gonna catch the cock?"" Now a classic line in our family joke repertoire."
">Innovation and Technology (OTA updates, FSD/AP)

Of note, others have full-vehicle OTA. Mustang Mach-E will have full-vehicle OTA and true ""hands free"" driving mode unlike current AP. 

>Long range and Supercharger network

Do look up the CCS chargers on your route - there are CCS chargers more convenient than Superchargers in some parts of the country. 

&#x200B;

I own a Model 3 myself, and I ordered a Mustang Mach-E to upgrade from the 3 later this year. I don't hate the 3, but the Mustang Mach-E looks infinitely better to me, has far better service network (nearest Ford dealer is 500ft from my house, nearest Tesla Service Center is 50 miles away), and charges basically just as fast (150 kW) and CCS chargers are more plentiful on the routes I travel."
"I, too, endorse Skydive California. There's a shuttle that runs from SF."
"I like this approach to the concept a lot, thank you."
