16679,"I agree. I've got 3 myself, but even at 5/6 she'll still need supervision. Squeezing them too hard or dropping them can result in broken limbs, paralysis,  or death. 

Furthermore they need unlimited hay 100% of the time. There are kinda that people are less allergic too, but it can still cause issues.

Third, they generally live 5-8 years and you'll need yearly check ups. You'll need to find a Cavy Savvy vet (someone who specializes in guinea pigs). This is usually an exotics vet. Each visit will likely cost around $100. They need this to keep tabs on their health, and the vet can check things you can't see, like their back teeth.

Also you need two. They're extremely social.

My Boost Mobile phone sometimes switches to Verizon's 1 xrtt's network even in urban areas.  I can't comment on mobile data speeds because I haven't used it.  I rather use T-Mobile.

Buy a half gallon of orange juice and drink it throughout the day until it's gone.

At the end of the day take a warm bath.  At the end of the bath turn up the hot water as hot as you can stand and stay in as long as you can stand.

Get out of the tub and, while still hot from the bath, go to bed and go to sleep immediately.

The next day you'll feel just a little bit better, but the morning after it will be like you never had a cold.

All I can say is when I pat dry and dry the cheeks, the toilet paper looks no dirtier than if I'd gotten it damp at the sink.  Never had anything go outside the toilet.  More focused than that.

That's probably the only complaint/warning.  The dial goes from 0 (off) to 1 (strong spray) to 2 (pressure washer/scalpel intensity) to 3, 4, 5 settings I don't dare to try.  It's very focused as a spray.",best items under $100
