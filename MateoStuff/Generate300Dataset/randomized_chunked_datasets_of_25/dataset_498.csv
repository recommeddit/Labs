9012,best toothpaste,"I wonder, though, if toothpaste affects the germiness of the toothbrush. Maybe toothpaste has  an imdirect benefit that didn't show up in the study, or works better if you use it after brushing without paste first ."

16679,best pet for toddlers,"I agree. I've got 3 myself, but even at 5/6 she'll still need supervision. Squeezing them too hard or dropping them can result in broken limbs, paralysis,  or death. 

Furthermore they need unlimited hay 100% of the time. There are kinda that people are less allergic too, but it can still cause issues.

Third, they generally live 5-8 years and you'll need yearly check ups. You'll need to find a Cavy Savvy vet (someone who specializes in guinea pigs). This is usually an exotics vet. Each visit will likely cost around $100. They need this to keep tabs on their health, and the vet can check things you can't see, like their back teeth.

Also you need two. They're extremely social.

Guinea pigs are a lot of work, but for an older child, they could be a good pet as long as you do most of the work and supervise her while handling."

30017,best money managing app,Personal Capital. Though I prefer paying for YNAB. An advantage of PC is that you can track investments.

65673,best phone service company,"i find sprint to be decent in urban areas where the have lots of band 41 (2,500 MHz sites).  Coverage in outer suburbs and rural area sucks - weak signal at best, drop outs at worst times.  My Boost Mobile phone sometimes switches to Verizon's 1 xrtt's network even in urban areas.  I can't comment on mobile data speeds because I haven't used it.  I rather use T-Mobile.  T-Mobile is usable everywhere I've been to even though my phone doesn't have band 71 (600 MHz)."
60937,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I feel like the odd one out because I loved all 9 seasons. Of course without Michael the show wasn't as good, but I thought it was still very good. The only episodes I didn't like were the ones with Will Ferrell."

48397,best color to paint with,"Thanks for your input! I guess in terms of style, we're looking for something clean and contemporary, yet comfortable. We have two young kids, so maybe scratch the ""clean"" part lol."
53213,best hiphop album,"Hell, I don't know.  I figured no one would make individual threads for each album so this would be the best place to put their essential tracks.  Wasn't trying to step on your toes."
13522,best research paper archive,Don't care that I've seen this a dozen times on Reddit. I'm upvoting because more people need to know about it!
67125,best places to skydive in california,"Outside of USA, it gets weird. I know a USA dropzone, when they fly out of the country for winter, they allow kids to jump too. But that goes against manufacturer's rules.
  
USPA requires that TIs adhere to tandem system's requirements. Outside of USA, USPA can't require that, i guess? Not sure if TI will get in hot water with tandem manufacturer for busting that rule. I have a feeling if they did, they'd lose quite a bit of business..."
53982,best medicine for a cold,"Okay, ready?  Only my family and close friends know about this and it's worked for *everyone.*  Now I share with the world.  You're welcome:

Buy a half gallon of orange juice and drink it throughout the day until it's gone.

At the end of the day take a warm bath.  At the end of the bath turn up the hot water as hot as you can stand and stay in as long as you can stand.

Get out of the tub and, while still hot from the bath, go to bed and go to sleep immediately.

The next day you'll feel just a little bit better, but the morning after it will be like you never had a cold.

No go, tell others of what you have learned today..."

44034,best items under $100,"Honestly can't say for sure, but I think it comes up at an angle.  It's shielded when the dial is set to 0, to protect the sprayer.  All I can say is when I pat dry and dry the cheeks, the toilet paper looks no dirtier than if I'd gotten it damp at the sink.  Never had anything go outside the toilet.  More focused than that.

That's probably the only complaint/warning.  The dial goes from 0 (off) to 1 (strong spray) to 2 (pressure washer/scalpel intensity) to 3, 4, 5 settings I don't dare to try.  It's very focused as a spray."
