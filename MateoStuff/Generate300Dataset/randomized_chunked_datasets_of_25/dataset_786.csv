This is the first deck builder you should own period. For me clank is a must have and I've never not had fun playing it.

Or for example if a big wedding ordered 50 bottles of champagne, they’d only give them 30 and would keep 20 back and if they ran out, they’d have to buy more. I reported this to Senior management and they just laughed saying it’s normal. I actually got told off for not taking part in this.",best hotel to live in
