20815,best workout music,"Mastodon
Akercocke
Nile
Behemoth
Aaaand 80s music (i need a hero, kim wilde, falco, you name it)"
55318,best action and adventure novel series,"*At the Mountains of Madness* is my most recent read that evokes that feeling. And I might be the only one who feels this way, but if you approach *Moby Dick* in that spirit you may be rewarded."
44351,best items under $100,"Clearly the best post. All of the other suggestions were just things that require work... utensils, slow cookers, etc. Fuck that noise."
31042,best country to live in,Any comments of Estonia’s future safety? It’s a small county and easy to invade
23487,best car racing video game,Gran Turismo was amazing. It was so addictive. I remember that feeling of *desperately* wanting to earn my way to the actual racing cars.
28998,best breakfast foods,Eggs been a dick!
60153,best freezer brand,"I don't have a thermo-fisher freezer either, but I do buy a lot of Duran glassware and Nalgene plastic containers through my lab. Those tough buggers are designed to withstand extreme temperatures and centrifugal forces, so they're probably as close to BIFL as you can get."
60976,Best comedy show on Netflix,3rd Rock From the Sun. It's my all-time favourite comedy series that I've rewatched multiple times and still find funny.
18088,best Kardashian,">""maybe she was curious about that normal people eat?""

She could come to my kitchen for that!!"
71741,best movies with a cool twist,"I wish I'd seen it before seeing so many references about it then reading to find out why. It's been a part of the ""pop culture"" for so long I doubt many people don't know what happens even without watching it"
18451,best YouTube video,[deleded]
48203,best color to paint with,"Then we'd have to put knockdown on it and try to get the texture to match. I'll just keep the lights dim, hang the art, have some cognac. First one to bitch about the paint goes to bed without dinner!"
29920,best money managing app,"I second Goodbudget! I also really like Buddy. 

Both are free and don’t require you to link your bank account info. I feel like I have to hold myself more accountable when I manually log my expenses."
36497,best alcoholic drink,"Get the best rye you can afford, Martini & Rossi sweet vermouth, Fee Bros. bitters (my fav), and Luxardo cherries"
11008,best backpack for college,"Yeah, in medical school i used a swiss backpack, went through three of them by my second semester. A friend suggested i spent the extra money for a northface backpack and ive never regretted it. Have had it now for 4 years with no problems. Sometimes it really pays off to spend the extra money on things you rely on everyday."
27949,best breakfast foods,"Grape nuts with vanilla soy milk.  It's a weird one compared to the awesome things in this thread, but I love it."
7916,best laptop for general use,Is it easy to somehow increase storage on the Gateway? I see it only has 256 gigs
19042,best YouTube video,Also 3Blue1Brown
26671,best board games,"I can't believe no one mentioned Clank!

This is the first deck builder you should own period. For me clank is a must have and I've never not had fun playing it. 

All the games listed here are good, but seriously OP if you want to get a new game the next one must be ""clank! In space"" for more replayabblity and a bit more depth (it has modular board compared to original clank!)

The game is full of tension from possible dragon/alien attacks and keeps everyone engaged because it could happen on anyone's turn"
52229,best hiphop album,The roots - How I Got Over
11309,best gifts for dad,My divorced parents are actually fairly good friends. They just... Don't get along for extended periods.
70986,best movies with a cool twist,Maybe because it’s obvious?
10831,best suitcase lock,"It's not a big deal and actually provides a lot more security.  For example if you arrive and your bag doesn't normally the hamster at the airport says ""we'll find it if we do"".  When you say ""hey my bag with a firearm in it is missing"" they give a lot more shits cause the TSA and ATF are next in line to give some shits."
32297,best hotel to live in,"I worked at a 5 star hotel in England as a bartender. Hosted events and stuff. One thing that was common was my manager would just spam extra drinks onto the bill at events to make more money. Or for example if a big wedding ordered 50 bottles of champagne, they’d only give them 30 and would keep 20 back and if they ran out, they’d have to buy more. I reported this to Senior management and they just laughed saying it’s normal. I actually got told off for not taking part in this."
