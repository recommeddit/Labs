37989,best Marvel movie,"I think this was part of it for me.  Lots of people praise The Dark Knight because the movie is packed full of stuff every minute, nothing feels offhandish or wasted.

Even the comedic parts of TWS are meant to serve a purpose, Cap trying to find his purpose in the world and live a life of normalcy.  I think by AoU he learns that he's not going to have that."

31117,best country to live in,"Idk, I’m a kiwi and I left for a while but it’s not because I couldn’t see a prosperous future here. I left because I wanted to experience the rest of the world! And I’m in a very limited job industry too (garment development)."
40457,best midrange GPU,"Maybe. 

But if you scale it down to power/dollar,  i doubt any card beats it in value. 

If you can save to buy a budget pc, you can save to get the best value. 

Whats the point of budget, if its obsolete shortly, and you need to make another budget purchase to replace it? 

Saving the 500 for the 3070 is the best choice. And save another 500 for every other component combined. 

50% of a builds budget should be gpu, 50% for everything else. 

1000 is a respectably budget friendly build cost. Not the lowest, no. But far from the highest. 

A 3070 will carry the build many years into the future. Can a ""budget"" card do that?"
46819,best hand santizer brand,"Look, I haven't done any research, but here's my perspective:

Let's say you shake hands with someone who had trace amounts of poop (doodies) on their hand. Now *you* have trace amounts of doodies on *your* hand.

If you use hand sanitizer, it may be sanitized, but you've just rubbed poop (amount doesn't matter; poop is gross) all over both of your hands.

If you wash your hands with soap and warm water, your hands feel great and you no longer have poop on your hands.

That's all I'm saying."

1. Alkemia Silken Tent - my signature, and some reviewers say it probably smells like Regina George
2. Hexennacht Black Mass - woody dark patch, incense, smoked vanilla, and marshmallows in a smoldering fireplace
3. Chanel Coromandel EDP - Incomparably elegant and beautiful and reminds me of my grandma in the best way - as she was when I was very small. 
4. Mugler Angel Muse EDT - one of my first fragrances! That nutella and passionfruit is perfect
5. Alkemia As Dark Things Are Meant To Be Loved - the most complex, sexy, dark smoky gourmand for date nights
