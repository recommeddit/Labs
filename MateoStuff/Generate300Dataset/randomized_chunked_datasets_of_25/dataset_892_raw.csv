"Weekdays: oatmeal with cinnamon & sugar, raisins, and sliced almonds

Weekends: waffles & bacon, plus anything my SO wants to make if we have the day off together. I'm going to attempt cinnamon rolls soon because I always loved the Pillsbury ones as a kid."

"I suspect a lot of the votes that make up their data were cast long ago.  Also, there is a limited selection from which you can choose.

"Don't underestimate an adult's occasional escapist desire to go on a fantasy adventure. I started reading Harry Potter as a kid, but my mother started reading Harry Potter at some point and has been this family's resident HP nut ever since. As in, reading each book dozens of times, watching and re-watching all of the movies several times over and so on. HP wouldn't have sold so ridiculously well if it had only had true appeal to children. (For that matter, all *good* so-called children's literature will be enjoyable to adults as well. Not everything has to be *The Blade Itself*.)"
