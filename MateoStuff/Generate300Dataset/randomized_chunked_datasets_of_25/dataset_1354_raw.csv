"That is an exceeding beautiful idea. I'm going to read the code later because I want to see how you've implemented that, but my python experience is limited (Java developer by trade, though I've used python a bit, mostly extending other people's code). Can the page template automatically output new fields, or is it a rigid table structure that maps one-to-one?"

"wasn't lack of patience, it was lack of knowledge. but otherwise, point taken."

"I’ve played a bit of two and a tiny bit only one and I think the main difference is that one feels a little closer to true table top mechanics, just those few more variables"
"Haven't got this exact one, but I do have their ""Giga office"" backpack and it's pretty decent. I don't exactly adore it for some of it's features which could be done a little differently, but it's pretty solid. I think it's been 3 years since I bought it? Not sure though. Used pretty much daily, usually fully loaded (30 l), heavy as f..."
It might be too late. When I'm seeing people post Lil B and MBDTF and Operation: Doomsday (shit known for its terrible production) you know they just didn't get it
"Yup, this is why so many politicians went to super preppy schools.  Being really preppy is a political negative on it's own, but those connections are worth a ton.  Far more than money alone."
"The AT will not get you to the 'dacks.  It runs east of there.  It cuts into southern Vermont, near Bennington, and runs northeast towards Maine."
"And he has been told that he doesn't deserve it.

I'd be pissed."
Women ka dege. Badme. Hrithik's performance in Lakshya was not as good as the guzaarish one.
"Lol. By the way, I'm not a dentist, but what I typed out is what three separate dentists and dental hygienicists have told me, pretty much verbatim. They've all explained it the same way each time, too, which makes it far more credible than if they all had different reasonings."

"That assumes you take college classes to solely get the stamp on your resume and not care about how well it benefits you on an intellectual level, as the post asks how it works out for you.  
  
I took one of my grad classes online and while I enjoyed the class, the format allowed me to slack off.  I noticed that as long as I clicked on other people comments (even if only looking at them for 1 second each) it showed that I was active and participating in all the discussions.  
  
College as well as any education or experience in life is what you make of it. When employers decide you are a good or bad prospective employee solely based on your education ""stamp"" on your resume it makes my eyes roll."
The WD40 was the point where I lost it.
"Currently gonna emulate GT3, then Gt4 and NFS the remastered versions. Would be cool if new games would be more progression based instead of just handing you the crazy cars from the getgo."
"That Johnny Knoxville story made me smile. He seems like such a cool, laid back guy."
"I bought a pair of vomero 8's and have reupped with the new model every year even if I don't need a new pair. Seriously the best shit ever, say what you want about Nike but they make fucking great shoes. This year's Vomero is the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever worn."
"I've made it my life's goal to ask her on a date. I dont even want her to say yes. Because I'd probably die. But I figure if I could ever work up the nerve to ask her out, I'd never have butterflys in my tummy again when asking a girl out."
I just started watching “in the dark” I’m on episode 3 and it’s pretty good so far. But I really recommend Hannibal and obviously dexter.
"I agree with you that theming rides is important.  I have never been to SFMM, and the only real ""theme park"" I've been to is Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, but it most definitely makes a difference.  Most mainstream U.S. parks are sorely lacking on the ""theme"" aspect (your Six Flags and your Cedar Fairs).

One of the first things I learned in ride construction - specifically from John Wardley - was all about the importance of the scenery.  I hope to make it to Alton Towers one day, and I also wish more American parks put an emphasis on their theming."
Definitely commenting so I can look this up kart
This is the most retarded fan theory I have ever read.
"Aaaaand, now I'm crying."
