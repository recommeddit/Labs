41530,"No, you're right. Theres a lot more organic kind of stuff like that on guitar. But you can still do some slide stuff sort of by dragging your nail on the keys. 

Piano has a lot of other advantages though. It has a bigger range, and the layout is really simple, and inversion possibilities far more flexible. 

It does have the pedals, which add a level of expression, and if you go digital, you can have after touch as well, and it *could* be even more advanced. There are mod wheels and stuff like that also, but, guitar is still better in the bend and tremolo and slide area and stuff like that.

It's also a lot more difficult. Especially acoustic guitar. Piano, you just press the buttons. Guitar is really difficult to play some chords, and do some things. Sometimes to just add one note you need to completely reset your grip, and there are a lot of chords you can actually fully play. 

On acoustic you are very limited for all the keys from A-Eb, for your low tonic. They need to be on the A string, which isn't very low, and you only have one higher chord you can play for it. 

Switching keys is easy on guitar and tough for piano, but guitars configuration is fucked up, whereas piano is real simple and logical layout. Visually easy for any given key, but transposing is more confusing.",best instrument to play

4557,"My most used editors:

nano - Simple command line editor, preinstalled on most distros, non-standard key bindings but they're listed on screen.  Good for basic editing, but it is limited in what all it can do.

micro - A command line editor that tries to be an improvement of nano.  Uses familiar Windows style keybindings for the most part.  On screen prompt for accessing keybindings and help.  Good mouse support for a text-mode program.  Good balance of features and ease of use.

vim - I've never wanted to sit down and relearn everything I know about editors to be able to operate vim effectively.  It is powerful, but it has its own keybindings and command conventions and I'd say it's not easy to use for that reason.  I know enough to do basic edits when a system only has vim (or vi) but that's about it.

gedit - I haven't really liked gedit since the transition from GNOME 2 to 3.  Old gedit (forked as pluma in mate) is pretty good but the new gedit UI is weird and unnecessarily dumbed down.  The search function using the up and down keys breaks convention shared by a lot of other editors, where enter keeps searching.

VSCode - I've been using this a lot at work and it is available on Linux as well.  Seems to do a great job at finding symbols in files even across a large project.  I mainly do C and C++ though.  Git integration, built in file compare mode, good search features, and familiar keybinds (for the most part, but you can rebind easily as well).  Fluid UI with nice themes.  Downside - it's based on Electron and eats resources.

Notepad++ (Windows only) - Another good editor, familiar keybindings, good multiline editing, good search features.  I use this one at work a lot too.  It works in Wine on Linux too.",best text editor

He would bring in international kids as servers and charge them $50 a day to live on premises; you never got time and a half, he'd just switch to paying you under the table instead. The assistant manager uh... estimated our taxes. Point is, he wasn't afraid of breaking the law in the slightest.

One day I broke a glass in the general vicinity of the ice machine and he _immediately_ whipped around and started questioning me, ""How close was it? Are you sure the lid was closed? Are you _absolutely sure_ nothing got in the ice?"" The lid was closed, but we were ready to close the entire bar just to clean out the ice machine, all from someone who wanted the cooks to charge themselves if they made food to eat after their shift. You do _not_ fuck with glass in people's food, just one incident can shut down an entire restaurant",best hotel to live in
22019,I cooked for her when she was filming the avengers in Cleveland. I didn't get to talk to her but based on the creeping we did from the kitchen she was bubbly and insisted on paying the check. My at the time chef also told me I was cooking her dinner which resulted in extra creeping on our part as the plates left the kitchen. If she looked over she would have seen 8 Cooks in an open kitchen watching her take her first bite.,best celebrity
