Well this is nice.  So... the best smelling cologne is... EVERYTHING
"I play racing titles very occasionally, always have, but when NFSU:2 came out there was a solid three month period when I played almost nothing else. It was legitimately far ahead of its time and I imagine among the PS2/OG Xbox era it'll have aged pretty decently compared to most titles from that time."
I can't get over the mix of nouns and adjectives in the wheel at the top.....
"have a photo done in a cute frame. or get a basket, one of their favorite movies, put in popcorn, a couple of sodas, and some candy. or maybe a gift card to a restraunt. good luck an happy holidays."
Because it was an unnecessary change from the original story
The Sleeping Bear Dunes is one of my favorite places in Michigan
I have never had to spend an extra penny at club med and have had so many great things to do that are included. Food and drink all day and night. We always go. I know what club med you are thinking of.
"Great, thanks much! I love hard boiled eggs but I hate peeling them too, so I'll have to try this next time."
My family is semi-close to the Manning's and we were invited for Thanksgiving dinner one time and when we got to their place Eli and Peyton were sitting in front of the TV arguing like kids just like in the commercials...probably one of the funniest things ive seen
"Iâ€™m using the pro max black leather case from Apple. Really nice feel in the hand, unfortunately someone knocked my phone from my hand on day 3, no damage to the phone but the corner to my leather case was scuffed"
"I use VPNProxyMaster for iPhone, works pretty well for smaller vpn usage from time to time. I remember there was a way to bypass all the virgin media blocks by changing the DNSâ€™s but i forgot the video that talked about it ðŸ¥¶"
Truly their greatest crime.
Upvote for Oryx and Crake by Atwood. Handmaid's Tale gets the most attention but O&C is a great speculative novel also set in a world that's very different but recognizable to our own.
Lmao true.
Tell us what you think on the hati.
DAMN RIGHT
"Perry Ellis 360 Black - I've received more compliments from women when wearing this than any other cologne I have owned.  But, just like another redditor mentioned, it does come down to whether it works with YOUR body's natural smell. 

And always remeber, guys... ONE SPRAY/SPRITZ IS ALL YOU NEED. Anymore than that and you're defeating the purpose of why you wear it."
"Not only that, but peer review is proving to be utterly useless in picking out which studies are reproducible, and which ones are fundamentally broken from a methodology standpoint.  For some reason, betting markets are just as good or better than peer review and journal editors at being able to pick which studies will be able to be reproduced."
My fav too. Much more refined that MBS across the way.
As an update to the antihistamines: Fexofenadine (Allegra) Cetirizine (Zyrtec) and Loratadine (Claratin) are known as 2nd generation antihistamines and are designed not to make you drowsy. Zyrtec being the slight exception there as there is a slight chance it will but nothing like Diphenhydramine (Benadryl).
"Ah, the most cited PLoS paper, if I'm not mistaken.

I've read this before, and while it makes an interesting claim, I've found it a bit confusing and wasn't totally convinced. Looking over it now, I think he gives a lot of criteria for when research findings are false, but he doesn't really show why those should apply to most published findings. Or did I not fully understand the paper?"
"Idk. I hate how it looks on white backgrounds. I have everything on dark mode because seeing the antiglare coating is infuriating. I've had this issue with other matte monitors.

Does no one else have this issue with white backgrounds? I just want to rip of the antiglare coating for it to go away or get a glossy oled."
"A day off.

"The Prestige! Seems slow but I really love how clever it is.  Plus, itâ€™s got Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Michael Cain"
"To not be a father for the dayNo, I change that to a nose hair trimmer."
