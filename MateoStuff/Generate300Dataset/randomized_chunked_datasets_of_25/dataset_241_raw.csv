Thanks for the good response!
"Came here just to say this. AO has some of the best glasses in the game if you roll with their style. Plus they're pilot certified ðŸ˜Ž  
   
(If you can't tell if you like AO or other sorts of glasses, don't hesitate to buy the cheapest knockoffs possible and try them out for a few days before you invest your $$ in them)"
People. Lots of them.
Do you think Rodgers is low or high?
"Living in a town with lots of sediment, I got one.  It is amazing.  I can drink my tap water.  My hot water doesn't smell so terrible all the time.  My dishes don't come out without spots.  (I realize this is anecdotal, but I thought I'd throw it out there).  I'm hoping it will cause my new water heater to last longer."
"It is, unfortunately, the future. Unless we can somehow make carbon-neutral gasoline economical ([which is evidently unlikely](https://youtu.be/0d0MPg7DxbY))."
"My girlfriend actually regularly tells me ""I can't tell you this in a text/email, ill tell you in person."" Not sure if she's paranoid or smart (she's super ambitious.)"

"Popsocket themselves now have a MagSafe Popsocket (so it's removable), might want to look into that!"

Well when youâ€™re discussing a list with multiple people called AD on it then no. Aaron Donald isnâ€™t known for being referred to as AD where as Adrian Peterson is soâ€¦yea. Donâ€™t call him AD when discussing a list that has an established AD on it.
Every other mouse will just be disappointing compared to the GPX in terms of battery life and build quality. If the GPX is comfortable just stick with it.
nah man. that's not how it works. give up.
Which University?
Insta-saving this! I have read a lot of them but glad to have a few more to complete!
Few of them are definitely overrated.
"These are the songs I felt best fit what you were looking for that were in my rap playlist. I bolded the ones I especially think would work well.

Youâ€™re the nicest. Thanks!
"Well, I also use my debit card sometimes (exclusively online), but both the bank and MasterCard already know where I live since you need to give them your address to open an account and card. 

I never use GPS, mainly because I don't need it. I really hope you are not using it to post check-ins on Facebook and other social media.

Too bad that you don't care, but if that's your choice, I respect it. 

Take care my friend :)"
Great points.  What do you do if you have Mgmt that fears even the chance of differences between dev and prod?  How do you convince them it's OK to use CentOS and RHEL?
"Walter Payton. I've just never seen anybody do more with less for longer (Hello, Chicago of the 70's). And his more was more that anybody else's more than I've ever seen. Ever down he played like it was the last play of the Super Bowl."
[Love this guy.](http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/photos/Ira_Flatow_hi.jpg) I think he looks pretty much like he sounds.
"There's no way they are, and the look is very easy to fake. They would just have to either make the text fit the bubbles or change the bubble size, simple task sorry."
