He has a nail in his anus.
Doki doki literature club. Itâ€™s a visual novel and can be played on pretty much anything.
The new edge. I was a chrome guy but it used up so much ram and drained my laptop. Switched to the new edge and it works great.
"ye VV:2 was a little lackluster but there were some great tracks on it, R.a.p. G.a.m.e. is one of my favorite tracks"

"Same here. We switched a few years ago. Currently paying about $130 for 5 lines, unlimited, an iPad and an Apple Watch. They pay for our Netflix and MLB.tv subscription."
"I just use my TV. Did figure out that I can run warhammer 2 in 1440p. I'll tell you, that made a HUGE difference."

"Fair enough! My Dad wasn't the kind of Dad who liked getting drawings and crafts from us as kids, so the fact he likes vandalized cards and will send vandalized cards means he is getting mushy in his old age, lol."

"Looked after properly, one of those knives survived 9 months of daily abuse cutting 400+ loaves of bread a day at one of the Subways I worked at. Then the newbie used it on the stainless steel bench out the back *once* and sadly no more could it effortlessly and cleanly slice through bread :(

So we pulled out a new $6 knife and started tracking how long that lasted."
"Ah yes, Jordan Peterson. Also known as 'Gwyneth Paltrow for men""."
