57363,best water brand,Seriously. Get a camelbak and a brita.
4768,best home improvement store,"If both are the same distance, spend a day going to both and talking with the staff/managers. If one seems to have more knowledgeable or friendly people, go there. The product quality is about the same."
63912,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,!books
41670,movies like Inception,thank you!! I’ll check those out :)
50711,best rap album,Do you have a sweet tooth? ^^[context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1EzkRpelY)
44980,best items under $100,A water pick. An absolute gamechanger.
56220,best action and adventure movie,"I'd definitely include Early Jackie Chan Hong Kong films such as:

Police Story(s)

Armour of God

Drunken Master

etc.

Star Wars films.

LOTR

Natural Born Killers"
73119,best Linux distro,"My laziness to install anything else, actually...

Manjaro is working tirelessly on my machine since 2014 where I installed it just to test :D"
30632,best Mexican war to study,"Seems to me that would be more acceptable than a meaningless war that has lasted longer than a decade. If you get him out of Afghanistan and into the custody of a third party country, you have much better options than wasting the life of US soldiers and pushing the country further into debt by chasing him around the mountains."
4403,best text editor,"No offense, but you're probably using vim wrong if you're still typing \`:w\` to write a buffer. For example, in my config I have \`:w\` mapped to \`<leader>w\` in normal mode  (where I set my leader to be the space bar). I also have \`<esc>\` mapped to \`jk\` in insert mode. So to write a buffer from insert mode, I just type \`jk<space>w\`."

39627,best podcast for biologists,"Ah I'd forgotten all about Kahn Academy, I used those for my A-levels!

And I'm willing to try any podcast really :) I mainly want them just for information in addition to revising etc, because I've found learning audibly to be quite useful, so it'd be nice to have something to stick on when playing video games etc :p"

I'd also add The Eminem Show and The Chronic"
58184,best cologne,I like the smell of clean clothes on men.
64741,Best Nike running shoes,"I'm at the point now where I look for certain specs in a shoe - weight, offset, type of support, amount of cushioning - so I usually will try out a few brands with the specifications I'm looking for and go with the one that feels the best in the store.  In my 8 year running career I've worn New Balance, Saucony, Asics, Adidas, Brooks, On, and Mizuno.  I don't really have a preference but I've taken a liking to certain models."
3523,best college for research,"Thank you for that suggestion. I have been thinking about the UK universities. I like the fact that it is easier to figure out if you will make it or not, because they are very clear on what they are seeking from an academic standpoint. 

The thing as you suggested though is that they also force you to specialize very early and the system is very different from the US system in terms of a well rounded liberal arts curriculum. 

Besides my Mom is kind of nervous to send me so far away :-) but they are also on the list for now!"
18785,best YouTube video,"""Now the trick here is to make it look like you've been jamming dicks into your eyes"" 

wut."
22510,best celebrity,It makes me so happy that she called you a boob.

66713,best soccer team in the world,"To us, he’s priceless"
3113,best webcamera,"pcs and laptops dont have good image processors, phones do have them, 3 in the sn888 and 6 in the ex 2100. Also good cameras costs much money, pc brands just cheap out or forget about them."
9317,best toothpaste,"My teeth look kinda stained though, and I brush and floss. Is there any way to whiten them without harming anything?"
