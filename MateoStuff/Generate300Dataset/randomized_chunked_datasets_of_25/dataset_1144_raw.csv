I've never heard of dry vanilla powder - off to Amazon!

This is one reason why iPhones will continue to stick with Lightning cables.
"I was surprised by what wasn't included on the list.

A big one is Vitamin D.  Lots of research out there shows that D has several effects directly against viruses.  Likewise it acts as an immune system modulator, limiting overreaction to novel viruses.

Zinc gluconate.  For years it was disregarded because it did not kill viruses.  Instead it inhibits their reproduction, but only in the mucous membranes.  Typically zinc is poorly absorbed by the sinuses, but zinc gluconate as well as zinc acetate are readily absorbed.  Gluconate has accomplished the valued ""will reduce duration and severity"" from the FDA."
"My friend did that.  People mocked his battery, but in a couple of weeks he has charged more phones and vapes than I can count and it still has a ton of battery left."
"I painting my tall vaulted ceiling Knoxville grey! Itâ€™s beautiful, looks like a forest canopy."
"Yay whisky! It kicks in fast. Isn't fattening. Has a cleaner hangover than wine (my other favorite). Sits on my stomach better than beer. And it's an acquired taste, so no one drinks all my alcohol. Plus I look so manly drinking it.

Yay whisky!"
"My mom is always looking to me for fashion advice, so I got her a necklace from J Crew that I loved but also reminded me of her. I even have a few outfits of hers in mind that she could wear it with. I'm really excited for her to open it :)"

The Fisker Ocean will reportedly have three seats as well."
Damn...this might be the most valuable thread I've seen in months.
"I kinda get what you mean. Thereâ€™s something about people on Reddit whereby they all same to love and hate the same thing. GoDaddy is a case in point. I see a lot of folks on here constantly rubbishing it and talking it down and I do get it that, yeah, GoDaddy spams the fuck out of you and theyâ€™re always trying to upsell you something. But my local business uses it and I know of other local businesses that use it and weâ€™ve never had an issue with it. Also, if it was so rubbish, why is it always number 1? Theyâ€™re quick, theyâ€™re stable, and whilst the customer support isnâ€™t the best, itâ€™s good."
I hope I can find another blogger list that includes Kill la Kill.  I'll be sad if it drops off the top 100 in the next update.
"Considering there aren't any analog buttons or triggers, the Switch isn't great for realistic driving games. I doubt there will ever be many options."
The most secure way of downloading apps is from the developer's website directly. Once installed most apps will search for updates when launched and notify you when an update is available for download and install. Trusting 3rd party services to do this for you carries a certain amount of risk or complexity on its own and can't really be recommended for a novice.
"Aye, appreciate this. This shit is soooooooo fire ðŸ”¥"
"Additionally, although it's quite long, I highly recommend T. Harry Williams' biography of him. It's a seminal biography."

I love my Caudabe Veil for my 6 Plus. They make [this version](http://www.amazon.com/Caudabe-iPhone-Premium-Ultra-Black/dp/B00NH5ZXR0) as well for the 6. Great amazingly thin case. I normally go naked with my phones but decided to add something so I can set it down on hard surfaces without worrying about marking it up. Couldn't be happier with it!
"Rejuvenation is an excellent source if your lighting needs are specific to an architecture style.  Art-deco, Mission, Tudor, mid-century modern, etc. and all finishes are custom.  They are not inexpensive though.

About 15 years ago they had a custom order of about 70 Tudor-style wall sconces ready to ship for a client who cancelled.  I guess they looked at my purchase history as the sconces coordinated with three other lights I bought from them.  I picked up a few for less than half the cost, and these lights were next on my list to buy!"
"I have the USB-C to C cable (100w), USB PD 100w charger, USB-C to HDMI dongle, and USB-C to DisplayPort cable and they all work flawlessly!"

Or red wine mixed with a diet shasta. And it HAS to be diet shasta. Idk why, but it works."
How do you not have to focus them? Never saw those those before.
