58570,best cologne,"Honestly, you're going to be very limited in the sub-$20 range. Like others have mentioned [Nautica Voyage](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Nautica/Nautica-Voyage-913.html) is a fantastic hot weather fragrance along with [Perry Ellis 360 Red](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Perry-Ellis/360-Red-for-Men-1906.html) which smells extremely similar to the much more expensive Acqua Di Gio. I'm not going to delve much into the darker and heavier scents as summer is coming quick, but for other quality colognes, you gotta be willing to spend a bit more than a twenty. 

[Versace Pour Homme](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Versace-Pour-Homme-2318.html) is a fantastic fresh and citrus scent with a smooth and sweet background of neroli and tonka bean that gets plenty of compliments. Not to mention, it's on the cheaper side at $25 for a 1.7 oz or $33 for a 3.4 oz [here.](http://www.fragrancenet.com/cologne/gianni-versace/versace-signature/edt#159889) 

[Mugler Cologne](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Thierry-Mugler/Mugler-Cologne-708.html) is another summer favorite of mine, with a simple, pure and soapy scent that makes you smell like a majestic beast straight out of the shower. $68 for a 10 oz bottle which is absolutely goddamn ridiculous considering how much juice you're getting out of it. $35 for a 3.4 oz otherwise [here.](http://www.fragrancenet.com/fragrances/thierry-mugler/thierry-mugler-cologne/edt#150371) 

Hopefully this helped somewhat, colognes take some time to get familiar with, and if you ever need a more experienced or varied set of opinions, check out Basenotes or Fragrantica. If you're buying, I love FragranceNet (Which I have linked to a bunch) due to their constant 30% sale, free shipping with ShopRunner, and excellent variety.

Cheers!

[Set Sail St. Barts](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Tommy-Bahama/Set-Sail-St-Barts-for-Men-1860.html) smells like a coconut piña colada, great for summer beach vibes, and is ridiculously cheap. $20 for 3.4 oz [here.](http://www.fragrancenet.com/cologne/tommy-bahama/tommy-bahama-set-sail-st-barts/cologne#154053)

[CK One Summer 2013](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Calvin-Klein/CK-One-Summer-2013-17561.html) smells similar to the legendary 2008 CK One Summer Edition. An aquatic, melony, and fresh scent that does better the hotter it gets. Get it on eBay for $19 a 3.4 oz [here](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Fragrances-/180345/i.html?_nkw=Calvin+Klein+CK+One+Summer+2013&rmvSB=true) before the years pass by and the prices inflate. (the 2008 edition is like $60-$80 now)"
62878,Best Data Science textbook,Any interesting ones you would recommend?
35814,best alcoholic drink,"I will admit that I first tried this soon after I started drinking because of The Big Lebowski (probably like most other people my age), but it really is my favorite drink.  It's like a boozy, coffee flavored milkshake.  It's delicious.

When I was in Iceland last year, we went to a bar in Reykjavik called Lebowski Bar, where they had 21 different kinds of White Russian.  I was in heaven."

40289,best midrange CPU,"Yes 2060 is powerful enough, and either i3-8350k or i5-8600k from intel, and r5-2600(x) or r7 2700 from AMD.
Personally I’d go with the i5 or the ryzen 5"
50526,best rap album,I believe the guys in r/music read the question wrong too.
60807,Best comedy show on Netflix,The Chris song came outta nowhere and fucked me up good
27095,best board games,"Brawling Brothers seem to skew results for a few of them because a game is really popular/well liked within their circle, and you got answers from all three of them rather than just one of them. Paladins of the West Kingdom and Underwater Cities for example. Age of Steam, Heavy Cardboard. Nice to see Twilight Struggle, Dominant Species and GWT stay on the top 100, truly some of the GOAT."
38237,best newspapers to read,"Wapo?  Hell no.  I worked there, and teams would refer to themselves as ""we"" when referring to the democratic party.  Also, the conservative writers they have there are EXTREME.  I'm sure that was no accident to make sure they don't come off as competent.

I'm quite moderate myself, probably leaning towards libertarian."

39647,best podcast for biologists,"It sounds like you want more of a study aid. All of the bio podcasts I'm aware of are more popular science types of things. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any that I'd recommend for educational purposes. So really, use podcasts to inspire yourself, but don't use them to educate yourself."
4136,best online college,"Grand Canyon University is a for-profit school in the same vein as DeVry, Ashford, AMU, or University of Phoenix.  As others here pointed out, they just aren’t held to the same esteem as most regionally accredited schools. ~~In fact, I think the DoD even banned AMU from being eligible for TA for a while, because they were seen as predatory and offering an inferior education. (I think Betsy DeVos is trying to undo this, but I may be wrong.)~~ (proved wrong by /u/colabear19)

I was doing some research for military friendly schools myself a bit back - here’s a few I found to be reputable, most of which are tied to state brick-and-mortar universities.

~~- University of Maryland University College (I know, stupid name)~~ I should do more research. University of Maryland College Park has a stellar reputation, not necessarily University College, apparently

- Arizona State University (great for technical degrees! I worked with a lot of engineers in Silicon Valley who got their Computer Science undergraduate and master degrees from here)
- Colorado State University (ty, /u/russki !)
- Penn State University
- Ohio State University
- Oregon State University
- Utah State University
- Excelsior College (I believe they’re a private school, but they’re very accommodating to military folks. I believe a lot of Master Chiefs of the Navy graduated from here.)

Military friendliness is one important aspect, for sure. But a school's reputation is another important aspect. You can try looking through US News' online programs rankings to scrutinize for yourself. (Of course, they're just one of many resources).
