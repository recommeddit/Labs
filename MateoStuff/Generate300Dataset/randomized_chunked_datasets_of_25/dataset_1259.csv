65387,best phone service company,T-Mobile could be the only carrier with reception in my area and I would struggle to recommend them. Their numerous outages throughout my career there of 10+ years were embarrassing. I get that all carriers can have outages but I had Verizon most of my time working there because tmobile always would go out.
68079,best science fiction novel,Ancillary Justice is far overrated.  The big reveal was completely predictable and it just seemed to plod on.
2957,best webcamera,But those users rarely use build-in cameras. Even cameras by Red aren't an unusual thing on twitch.
68571,best science fiction novel,"How can you say they’re boring or speak to the relevancy of their content if you haven’t even read them? 

I’ve read all of them and I’m nowhere near 50. If you told me a few books you’ve enjoyed I could probably pick one off that list that would blow you away."
65544,best phone service company,Poor reception
22938,best celebrity,My wife grew up with a member of his distant family. Once she went to Upstate New York and he happened to be there. This happened to be after he had filmed Lord of the Rings but before the first movie it come out. Apparently she got rather wasted and he helped her find the bedroom in this big house make sure she was tucked in and brought her a big cup of coffee the next morning. He also told her at the time that the only reason he did Lord of the Rings was because of son was so excited he got the chance to do it. If it wasn't for that he probably never would have done Lord of the Rings.
6694,best iPhone,"Typing this on an iPhone 7 hand-me-down from my mom. It runs perfectly fine.

Recently I upgraded to it from an iPhone 6 (from the same source) that I gave to my brother. It still is getting security updates and works fine"
11298,best gifts for dad,"A couple of years ago, my daughter got me a Kindle.  It was the best gift ever.

Of course, she was two, and didn't have any money, but if she'd known how much I wanted it she would have gladly bought it with my money.  Instead, I had to buy it myself and then give it to myself from her.  Come to think of it, she may not have ever seen the box.  Kindles rock."

Which one will you guys recommend? I play around 1-2 hours a day and work 10 hours. My work is mostly around Microsoft Word, Chrome, and a few CRM's. I will also connect my HP i5 laptop with SSD. I need a monitor which is both PS5 and works friendly. How would my experience be playing on 2K monitor instead of 4K? I am currently playing on MI 55 inch LED 4K tv."
27462,best bollywood actor,Watch Sparsh. He plays a blind teacher. Effortless acting. Also features Shabana Azmi.
14389,best romantic novel,"I loved The Flatshare too! I have ""The Switch"" on hold at the library ready for pickup and I'm excited to read it."
30289,best Mexican war to study,"We are taught that we started the war, which we did. We were also taught how mexico was very unstable at the time and much of the land taken was barely administered and only really part of mexico on paper.  It was two countries fighting over conquest. The US won."
26536,best board games,"I'd put **Coup** or **Bang! The Dice Game** in place of Sheriff of Nottingham. Otherwise, that's a great starting point for people."
59762,best perfume,"Really? I've heard the opposite, like LT and TS's description of men's perfume as ""The Wasteland"" and ""a men's fragrance is a women's fragrance made entirely of top notes""."
49359,best gaming monitor,did you use black frame insertion or pixel overdrive on the asus one?
62732,Best Data Science textbook,Hands-On Machine Learning with scikit-learn and TensorFlow
72724,best wireless lightweight mouse,"I would say the Razet Viper Ultimate( on white, rose or cyberpunk edition since those are the ones with v2 switches) It's only 74g and its shell its actually very robust for my taste(I usually rage quit after 3 hours of csgo and I throw or hit or smash my stuff)My RVU has gone trhough my whole setup room flying and ending smashed in the wall but it still works and looks as good as new, and well, 74g, a top tier sensor and wireless, its what ur looking for, and plus, almost every mercury white and rose quartz includes a charging dock as u may know"
53395,best usb c charging cable,"Just so this isn’t an ad for Anker, UGREEN also sells the same quality cables"
56577,best desktop monitor,"Yes, I have had many issues mixing 144Hz with 60Hz.  If your 144Hz has G-Sync, it might not be an issue, but if you ever have any moving images on your 60Hz display while you're playing a game on your 144Hz display, it will probably stutter and/or cause frames to drop closer to 60Hz.

I used to watch YouTube, Netflix, etc. while playing games, but I had to stop when I got my 144Hz monitor.  Windows and Nvidia don't do a good job at functioning at different refresh rates simultaneously.  You can avoid this by putting a static image on the 60Hz display such as the desktop or the front page of Reddit.

My 144Hz monitor was the AOC G2460PF (no G-Sync), so you might be okay with the G-Sync variant, but just keep this stuff in mind when making your decision."
55864,best action and adventure movie,"I hope they set it up with a major streaming service and do it like BOSCH does with Amazon. Each season is one book, starting with the origin story in Hawaii (Pacific Vortex if memory serves correct?)."
73032,best Linux distro,"They ""assume liability"" in exactly the same way that Microsoft ""assumes liability"" for Windows; they promise absolutely nothing, but will try to help you fix any problems that arise.

Suits tend to find this comforting for some strange reason."
58587,best cologne,"Geoffrey Beene - Greg Flannel.

Cheap, last long, smells good."
48320,best color to paint with,"Nope, that’s an untinted white and it’ll usually be fine. Some people like whites with a bit of a tone somewhere to warm it up or cool it down, but plain white is fine. It’s your house and your style!"
62843,Best Data Science textbook,"Hm, I find that explaining the results of a Bayesian model is a lot easier than explaining black-box algorithms like XGBoost. I can draw a graphical representation of the inference and then say: 'if this happens, then the probability of that happening goes up, and then the probability of \_this\_ happening goes down and so on, until we get to the final prediction.'"
