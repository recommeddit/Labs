I got one because of the hype and hated that thing. I think mine was too heavy. I felt exhausted after i woke up.
"*dad wakes up* I'm hungry...me- ""high hungry I'm 666"""
I like Nestle because I know supporting them will create legions of angry keyboard warriors.

"Best Western Plus in Den Haag (The Hague) 

The Room, the shower (glass in the middle of the room), the people. It was awesome and perfect for a romantic weekend."
"Jean-Claude Van Damme was on the same flight as me. He was super friendly.

Emma Watson (during her Harry Potter years) used to frequent a 
restaurant I worked at, she was always very nice.

I met Sir Ian Mckellen this year, he unfortunately was not at all nice. Which was sad as I imagined him to always be really nice."
"Some hotel in China, I’ve forgotten the name but it was at the airport in Guangzhou. It was 5 stars but still really cheap and only 455 dollars for me and my mum to stay in a premium room (we did only stay one night). The food was great and the service was outstanding."
I play several different instruments and have for years. I still feel like a little kid when I sit down at a drum kit.
[e text editor](http://www.e-texteditor.com) is pretty good.
"Agreed! I've reread that book so many times over the years. Styxx too. I have to say for how much I hated Styxx in Acheron's book, she really managed to redeem him later on."
I've lived in IL most of my life and I'd have guessed Reeses. I wouldn't have put Jolly Ranchers in the top 10. I would have thought even gross-ass Smarties were higher in sales.
I really need to know why she won't go on a cruise/ you won't go with her. You can't do this to me
"I'm surprised no one has mentioned The Killing yet. My wife and I loved it.

Edit: I see OP has already listed it. I'll keep it up anyway."
The texture of the silicon case is really unpleasant - it catches in every single pocket you put it on. It also has terrible durability for its price (see my post history)
"I mean the US didn't want to go to war, we wanted to go to the bank. Fighting between folks importing from the US made it politically complicated enough for the powers fighting that they dragged us into WWII."
"Put 2 Shredded wheats in a bowl. Fill it with boiling water. After 15 seconds or so, strain off the boiling water.

Add butte and sugar to taste, mix thoroughly with the hot, soggy shredded wheat and enjoy.

My mum learned to make this because my dad's mum made it for him. His family was from Liverpool. I've no idea whether that was a local dish or just a family tradition."
As Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne
For some reason the changes tab never refreshes for me.
"What carrier is that? T-mobile? I can't find a plan less than for $60 for 1 line.

Also note that T-mobile coverage is non-existent in Nebraska"
"With so many high points, the one aspect of this movie that most stuck with me was Tony Leung as Wenwu. Damn, that guy can act. And he was deeply evil while also being complex and relatable, to an extent. The casting in this movie was all-around 10/10, but Tony especially gave us a villain we will never forget."
"Every time I see it make me cry laughing, even after the 7th time in a row"
A few places in Asia and a few select countries in Europe.                                                                                               Canada and especially America....in my opinion wouldn’t even be in the top 10 best countries to live in.                                            Source: A Canadian that travels.
