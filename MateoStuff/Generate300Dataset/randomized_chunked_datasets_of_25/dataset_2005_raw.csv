"Distrowatch is _not_ a measure of popularity. I blogged about it explaining why. https://popey.com/blog/2021/01/distrowatch-is-not-a-measure-of-popularity/

In short it's two things. 1) Because they count internal links, so they publish an article about a distro, or there's a new distro release, that links to the page, the numbers go up. 2) Being at the top of the list means you get clicked, and that (stupidly) counts to push you up. You're at the top? You're staying there."

"An Australian brand called Local Supply make really good sunnies. They last ages, can take a beating and are good for your eyes. Look after the lenses and they should be fine for ages (1-2 years of solid use). IMO they look pretty good too. They'd ship to America but not sure about the cost

If you want a pure water then I'd suggest a distiller. They'll last a long time as well as you can usually fix any of it if you're handy. Only downside is no nutrients or minerals in your water. But nothing like Fluoride either. A lot of filters are just for taste FYI. Be sure you're looking into the filter type and if its doing what you want it to do. Distiller is the only way to get pure water.

Try [Heist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAKwrYxHhfY) with Gene Hackman. The movie has to many twists that you'll get tired at the end. It also has fantastic dialogue.
