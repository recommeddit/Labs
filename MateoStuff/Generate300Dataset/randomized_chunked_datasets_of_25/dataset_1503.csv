54953,"I agree with you in that they would not be a certifiable treatment for untreated drinking water in and of itself (in most cases).  Carbon filters in general can significantly improve the quality of untreated water, and is actually one of the processes used by most municipal treatment facilities.  The OP did not specify treated/untreated water.

My understanding of the question is the OP is wanting to know if the carbon filters actually do anything useful.  And yes, they are one of the most cost-effective treatment processes in creating safe drinking water.  Activated carbon has been used for thousands of years in this manner.",best water filter

73513,"I've been using large Anker and Ravpower banks for years. They've been okay. I got the zendure powertank maybe 6 months ago, and it's been fantastic.  I wanted pass through charging and 65W or better USB type C output, and it supports both of those. The biggest issue is that it's pricy, and their new powertank model is even more expensive.",best battery bank
