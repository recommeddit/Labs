"""The Power of Habit"" and ""Atomic Habits"" are both fantastic and I can vouch for them 100%"
"We have been buying a lot of coupons because I thought the code generators stopped working.

It has definitely still been worth it but

Do you have more info you can share about that spreadsheet?"
Omg I loves City and have never met anyone who had heard of it!
Another good trick if you can’t get it for free and it’s from somewhere odd.... copy paste the title into google. Sometimes you can find a PDF of the paper! When you click the direct file link it will bring up the PDF for free and you won’t have to pay 60 dollars for a week access.
I think we are just in the infancy stage and we are going to look back at electric cars right now the way we look at people from the 90s who carried those massive brick cell phones.
yeah you should also just add every major sub since they all have devoled into politics
"Depends how much shit you have, I bring a backpack for trips more than two weeks. $0 bag fees. Depends what airline you have and you obviously have to go through the inconvenience of having to go and pick up your luggage and then re shipping back when you come back, extra stuff you have to do."
"I actually saw Jared Leto, too, at Hard Haunted Mansion last year.  He was somewhat ""out of it"" haha and didn't really say anything, but he wasn't mean or anything, just kind of in his own world. 

I met some celebrities when I worked for the ticket office in college.  Matt Groening was extremely friendly, and was really happy when I was (lamely) praising of Futurama (and Simpsons) haha.  He had to sign something when he picked up his ticket from me at the will call, and I was considering taking it as a memento, but didn't for some reason...  Also, John Lithgow was nice, too, and so was David Sedaris."
Were the spark plugs still good?

Stone Cold Steve Austin found my dog that ran away and picked him up off of the highway. He ended up cleaning up our dog and gave him tons of toys before we got him back.
"Huh. Seems pretty solid, with a few surprising individual results (I guess ScreenRant really didn't like Thor: Ragnarok) but overall reflects general sentiment.

I too am *shocked* that the one MCU movie nominated for Best Picture is also generally agreed to be one of the best MCU movies. Real shocker there. Just shocking."
I have no idea what's inside my razer black widow but I like them
Anything similar for audiobooks?
"Thank god It's not that popular you know, I would be really jealous if a guy who is more good looking than me wears this instead of fucking Aqua di Gio"
"Hey, at least he's housebroken."
Dat’s one dapper doggo.
Sounds great. Thanks for elaborating.

A package with 5 million weekly downloads and commits as recently as 5 days ago is considered dead?
At least the last time I tried it it said to uncover my face.
"I’m just so polarised on this game. In a simple take, it’s just a dice game. Everything is about a dice roll. 
In another take, it’s a comfortable strategy fantasy game, great for kicking back and seeing how some light strategy pans out against the dice rolls.

Honestly not sure it’s anywhere near my top 20 though even. (I’m not trying to put your opinion down though). 

Have you tried other digital board games on iOS? Through the Ages and Race for the Galaxy are brilliant as is Star Realms. Those are some of my faves for board games."
Could you do one for non-European teams? I agree with you though
"Movie pissed off my ex so much. She was convinced that after all that, it didn't matter if it was all part of the game - it seemed like a bigger version of ""IT WAS JUST A PRANK, BRO!"""
