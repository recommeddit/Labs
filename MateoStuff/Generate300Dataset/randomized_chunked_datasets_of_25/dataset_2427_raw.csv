"I play piano and my friend is a violist. I was commenting to him how surreal I thought it was that he has to create the note by remembering exact finger positions on the strings while bowing rather just hitting a specific key.

I don’t think one is necessarily easier than the others - they all have their complexities!"
"I'd like to add on OP's question by asking the ones of you that wear prescription (so not transition) glasses exactly how they wear them. I mean, do you switch between sun and normal glasses during the day? do you only go out with your sunglasses or do you always bring the normal ones along?

as you can imagine I've been meaning to get prescription sunglasses but the transitions​ are too high maintenance and I know I'm too lazy to switch between two pair of glasses all the time"

Persona 5 Royal. Easily one of the best games overall on the PS4. great if you enjoy JRPGs.

"At Bumbershoot in Seattle in 2000. I geeked out. Stammering. He was very gracious, considering he was confronted by a spastic mess. We were front row for his set later that night. A great day, obviously."
What about the VW e-UP?
Women seem to enjoy it when I rub the samplers from ESPN Magazine all over my body. Sometimes I get papercuts though.
"As my Jewish friend said, ""Do you know how many Jews are in Jewish studies?""

""No""

""None.  Real Jews study law, medicine, or finance."""
Another interesting trend I'm noticing here. Any explaination for the pretty high draw % from 1960-1990? About 30-50% matches ending in a draw.

What gpu are you upgrading to? I'm looking into to upgrade my gpu and monitor to run at 1440p 144hz. I currently have a rtx 2060 and benq  60hz monitor. Im looking into a 2070 super. Would that be sufficient?
Thank you!!
