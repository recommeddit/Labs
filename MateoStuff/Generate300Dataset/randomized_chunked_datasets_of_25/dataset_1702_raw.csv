"Not to beat a dead horse, but def the hardest left turn I’ve ever seen in a movie."
"I can't tell if people here upvote this shit because they really think this is really a ""Life Pro Tip"" or this sub is satire and its just funny to mock people like me."
"Had to scroll way too far for this. Can’t recommend it enough, please check to see if your local Habitat for Humanity runs a Re-Store.

The stock is often brand new equipment and supplies donated by local builders or leftover from home builds, and lots of random donated furniture and housewares. Unpredictable but you can find some real gems, the last pleasant thrifting experience."
"For Mexican food also check out El Sitio and Super Cucas. Have to agree that La Super Rica and Lily's Tacos are both some of the best Mexican restaurants in town. There's always Los Arroyos and Los Agaves, but in my opinion those are a bit too popular and packed, and frankly not as authentic and awesome at the other places.

Sorry there isn't as much of a restaurant selection as you'd hope for, but as you get to know Santa Barbara better you'll find some awesome places that you'll love. Welcome to Santa Barbara!"
"I got an Odyssey G7 32' last week. Great Monitor and after the last Windows 10 Update, HDR becomes Viable. I returned it 2 days later though.   
I'm a fan of a bit of Curve, 1800R is fine, even 1500R, but man, that 1000R Curve, everything looked distorted to me, Plus I got a bit of Nausea sometimes.  
Other people have got used to it though and they don't mind it anymore.  


Samsung will release Flat Versions of G7 in the Q2 of 2021, so if you want to wait like me, it's worth it, even though I'm not a fan of totally Flat Monitors, especially on VA Panels.

AW2721D, I'm thinking about it, but it has IPS Glow Issues plus Low Contrast compared to VA Panels, so I'm sceptical since I always game in total dark or low ambient light."
He lets his dick do the talking.
"Yeah, they really would see eye to eye."
"I used [Nord's trial](https://www.synthesizerguide.com/nordVPN/) and never went back to anything else. Although for torrenting specifically, you got a couple of other decent options. My personal faves include:

Torguard

Cyberghost

ExpressVPN

There are a lot of options to choose from. Just do a little but of research on reviews for each vpn to know the best one for your circumstances."
"I'm gonna be honest with you, that smells like pure gasoline"
"Shot of whiskey, 1/2 cup hot water, spoonful of honey, drop of lemon juice. 

Have a few of those and you'll be cured, or you won't care."
Copy paste missions with a progression you can pay to skip. Ubisoft shlock.
"To be honest, getting kicked awake by Chevy Chase would be a pretty great story to tell people."
"a little bit of black tea extract ""im talking like 90/10 or 95/10 will help even more but you dont need to go that far."
I am blessed with a neutral gait and natural midfoot strike. I actually tend to prefer less cushioning.
"Yes, sorry, it was in response to singstrim above."
Edge all the way
"New pair of socks. If you’ve been wearing the same pairs forever like I typically usually do theirs nothing like putting on a new pair of freshly bought socks, you can totally feel the difference, I never realized til was an adult sadly but I appreciate the feeling of new socks all the time."
"Get a guitar and learn to play it in open tuning, like open D. It's far more easier to begin with, than the basic tuning. DADGAD tuning is great for celtic stuff. The reason why I recommend open tuning to beginners is that you can go straight to just playing and improvising. Just hit the strings and see what happens."
"Persona 5

Nier Automata

The Witcher 3"
The guilty (2018)
"Great idea, thanks!"
"Hey there, sorry about that. I'll work on getting that fixed today and let you know when it's good to go."
Ugh. The only way my parents ever got me to eat oatmeal was by buying the one with the dinosaur eggs. And even then I just ignored the oatmeal in favor of the tiny dino babies.
[Cloudways](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/cloudways/) or [siteground](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/siteground/) are my personal favorites atm.
