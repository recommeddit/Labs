I mean the war was kind of like if the Magas and Mexicans switched positions. The Americans moved and settled there for a long enough period that they felt like/claimed they were natives.

They design their rides to not only be fun to ride, but to also look nice. I noticed that at all the Cedar Fair parks I have been to almost all of the thrill rides and roller coasters were placed to fit in with the landscape.
