70129,best major to study in college,"So, hmm, I'm not at all interested in any kind of medical shit and I suck real hard at math and other exact sciences. Where does that leave me, the gutter? 

That was my thought process before deciding to study International Relations (love politics, foreign affairs and stuff). I finished school this year and absolutely love my major. Maybe I won't get instantly employed and making 50k like if I had majored in engineering, but I'll tell you what, I love what I do and I'll work my ass off to compensate that handicap.

Actually working to get accepted on a masters program right now. Wish me luck. :)"

46039,best trick or treating candy,"Y'know, i never really put that much thought into them. Basically its a bunch of popcorn that bas been compressed into a ball and then held together with some sort of sticky, sweet stuff. Im not exactly sure what holds it together or if it varies depending on how you make it. So you get the saltiness and crunch from the popcorn, and the sweetness feom whatever it is that holds it together. Theyre a neat little treat"

31223,best country to live in,"I haven't visited Ecuador, but I found Costa Rica to be a bit depressing, honestly. The urban areas weren't very nice and most of the beachfront property had been bought up by rich old foreigners. At least on the Pacific side."

53412,best usb c charging cable,"I’ve had great luck with their braided nylon ones. I have one at home, one at the office, and one in my jeep that gets beat up pretty bad. It’s been slammed in the glove box and the car door too many times to count."
72597,best keyboard switches,"Definitely Cherry MX Reds for any FPS gaming. It may seem weird, but not having that click every time you press WASD to strafe in Counter Strike does something for me (and most other people I talk to about this) subconsciously where I don't think about the button attached to the movement, I just move. 

For MMOs and MOBAs, I would assume having a bit of tactile click would be better. Reds are very very sensitive and there's no feedback at all, and you don't want to accidentally Chronosphere when you just hovered over the key and thought about it for a second! I'd prefer Browns in those games, as they're not as clicky as Blues."
44454,best items under $100,So glad I learned how to properly sharpen knives on stones. In my household we have always had dull knives and learning to use stones and a strop have all my knives razor sharp. Some knives just need a touch up on the strop to get razor sharp .
68294,best science fiction novel,"""Fire Upon The Deep"" and ""Deepness In The Sky"" despite being in the same universe / same author are kind of on opposite sites of the space opera spectrum; kind of like ""Ender's Game"" versus ""Speaker for the Dead,"" the first is more action-driven and the second more idea-driven."
