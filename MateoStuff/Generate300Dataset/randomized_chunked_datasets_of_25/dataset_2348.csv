That was my thought process before deciding to study International Relations (love politics, foreign affairs and stuff). I finished school this year and absolutely love my major. Maybe I won't get instantly employed and making 50k like if I had majored in engineering, but I'll tell you what, I love what I do and I'll work my ass off to compensate that handicap.

Actually working to get accepted on a masters program right now. Wish me luck. :)",best major to study in college

Im not exactly sure what holds it together or if it varies depending on how you make it. So you get the saltiness and crunch from the popcorn, and the sweetness feom whatever it is that holds it together. Theyre a neat little treat",best trick or treating candy

72597,"Definitely Cherry MX Reds for any FPS gaming. It may seem weird, but not having that click every time you press WASD to strafe in Counter Strike does something for me (and most other people I talk to about this) subconsciously where I don't think about the button attached to the movement, I just move. 

For MMOs and MOBAs, I would assume having a bit of tactile click would be better. Reds are very very sensitive and there's no feedback at all, and you don't want to accidentally Chronosphere when you just hovered over the key and thought about it for a second! I'd prefer Browns in those games, as they're not as clicky as Blues.",best keyboard switches
