I use ranger if I'm working with visual media (pictures and videos). It gives me a nice picture preview and a thumbnail script gives nice video previews.
Yes actually pretty satisfied ! I thought it was stiffier but its actually pretty foldable
"PHEVs and Range Extenders are the worst of both worlds. You end up with a terrible EV and a terrible gas car. 

I have never enjoyed road trips more (or taken more of them) than with my Model 3. I have put 1-3k a month on in road trips alone."
It's dope seeing ppl drop uk drill in this thread

Thanks for this!!!!!
"Not sure if you are still looking at this but i was in san miguel last year and it was horrible. Old and rundown, and it is not coed floors a result, while i do have a lot of friends, they are all guys and its harder to hang out with chicks. We had like 6 move off the floor because it was so hard to socialize with other people. Id say do one of the low rise options, you'd have a much better time."
"Glad to hear you’re happy with the XM1, I am too. I think I did separate my bias against FinalMouse from the review, like I said I love the Air58 (other than the scroll wheel) and I had a bad experience with the UL2 but for people with smaller hands it’s probably a welcome addition. The rest was just jokes. I do think they’re a shitty company though"

I've been trying to figure out who makes my sunglasses. They're Robert Graham Skyline in gold. Best pair of sunglasses I've ever owned. Going on 2 years without a scratch in the lenses. Retail price was $270 but I paid $45 for mine. I want to avoid Luxottica for obvious reasons but I'd love to purchase this brand again as they're apparently well-built. I'm hoping they're not Luxottica built.

This list is also extremely skewed to newer games.
"As a dude who has a BA in theology, I 1000000% agree with this. 

I was studying to be a catholic priest. Left seminary, but continued with my undergrad theology degree. I don't want to teach high school. I don't want to go on to get a masters and PhD so I'm not going to be a professor. I absolutely hate the way catholic youth ministry is run so I'm not going to do that. Those are my options. Fuck em all. I now teach gymnastics to preschoolers and assist with the team coaches for the older kids."
"The Harvard of Canada eh? If you're the something of something, you really aren't the anything of anything."
"Yea Genghis was pretty awesome.... and his ""genocide"" is sort of debated.  The thing is, when he invaded cities... after getting in, he would find the leaders and aristocrats (which at that time included historians) and would kill them in public so they didn't have to waste their energy on trying to beat the general population into submission.  Killing a lot of historians = historians being scared shitless of the horde and writing horrible things about them."
I think most people are concerned about the baggage handlers. Seeing as how they do most of the work behind scenes.

"I’ve owned and disliked 24 Fabourg from a blind buy in Hermès for a year. I tried it again two nights ago after my shower and it was the cleanest, most elegant soap smell on me. I just adore it now!"
"So we are to the point where a little short of a 'work day' of driving is doable in today's EVs.

In the US you can drive for 7 hours east or west and stay in the same time zone, and we have 4 zones across the lower 48 states. So going cross-country is possible, and maybe more safe due to more mandatory stops to recharge, which means the driver could refresh more frequently."
