"Sherwin Williams has a historical color palette collection that you could pull inspiration from or use. Mid century modern used a lot of bold colors and patterns such as turquoise, hot pink, mustard, avocado, tans, and tons of wood (mainly red and yellow undertoned). It's kinda came back in style (in a more modernized way). Textures also play a huge part (mixing natural elements with shiny man-made things). If I remember my design history correctly, this was a post war effort to lift spirits and make things happy again. Worth noting there is a drastic difference in the design and architecture of the 30s-40s and the 50s."

RetroPie. That is all.
MAM is fairly easy to get into when you're on other trackers with an invite forum. Bibliotik is the hard one to get into. You need a library card for that one.
"surface charge tends to be pH driven.  A common figure that you'll see in papers is a point of zero charge diagram. 

Natural organic matter, often referred to as NOM, which is a water contaminant that is often removed by AC has a negative charge in water. 
Carbon can have either a negative or positive charge depending on the carbon properties its self and the pH.  So if you are removing NOM you want to have a carbon with a positive surface charge. 

[Not sure if you have access to it or not, but this article has a couple of good figures illustrating what I've shown above.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979798959756)"

This is the real answer... use your phone and one of those flexy little tripods and maybe a ring light
"Well, nope."

I still donâ€™t understand what the ending meant when it comes to Shutter Island. Great movie
"As a former drug store employee who would hide more than a few bags of reeses in the stockroom until two days after Halloween so I could buy them at 50% off plus my employee discount, I approve of this message."
">It's just that the unknown wire gauge also suggested the weight difference.

It's also very easy to cheat. I've seen ""high quality cables"" that feel really thick, only to find upon cutting into it that it's the thinnest of wire, with lots of padding."
Letâ€™s be honest the old ranking was partially a result of gaming the rankings by playing friendlies against sides you knew you could beat. Nations League shone a light on the true level.
Iâ€™ll admit UCSD has outstanding problems but I donâ€™t understand how US News is putting UCI and UCSB above it. Is there a detailed breakdown? No offense to alumni from either school but UCSD is consistently rated higher than UCI and UCSB in every other university ranked list.

The professors should tell it every student at the start of every lecture...
"It sure does, I just like Knoebels better."
"Not a problem. And based on your update, I'd definitely say *Dave Made A Maze* falls into that category. It's a bit zany, while *Inception* is very brooding, but certainly fits that bill.

Hope you get a lot of other great suggestions as well!"
