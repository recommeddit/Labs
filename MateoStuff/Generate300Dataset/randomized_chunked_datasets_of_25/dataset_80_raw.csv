"typical booze does work as sanitizer, booze isnt 99%... 

the ideal % for alcohol is 70%, more will loose eficiency and will be more harmfull to the skin, less will loose eficiency too, but will still do something"
Yeah your right no monitor has a true 1ms response time but the point of my comment was to explain the difference between gaming monitors and other monitors so I just used the common specs listed by manufacturers. I didn't feel the need to try to explain why monitor response time listings are wrong bc I felt it was off topic to the question.

I love the Mods here. I don't think you'd find something like this in any other subreddit. Keep up the great work around here.
"Indeed. Beware the ""[Middle Ground](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/middle-ground)"" logical fallacy."
"That's absolutely a downside. I feel like a lot of other countries I've looked into have disadvantages too though, whether it's availability of solid investments, security, stability of government, availability of quality food, etc. 

As far as healthcare goes, if you pay for a qualify insurance policy, you're going to get good care. There are other countries where the care is free but may not be good. 

I also think the US socializing medicine is only a matter of time (basically once the boomers die off), so it also depends on what your time horizons are for retirement."
"That's generally the pseudo science reasoning, my apologies."

"I saw the most of the major ones coming but I think that's because it was so intricately plotted. Movies sometimes just focus on one gotcha without laying any groundwork for it to make it more unpredictable. Prestige, on the other hand, was brimming with subtlety and gave the viewers a much fairer chance at the guessing game."

"You have to be smart about it. My degree in a STEM field had an average starting salary around $50K when I went to school. Over four years I went in-state, did Community College for 1.5 years to get the 'basic' classes out of the way cheaper, and then went hard for the nest 2.5 years. I ended up with about $35K in loans that I will be done paying off this December, basically 15 years early. I also paid about 15% more each month than the minimum to eat the principal away quicker. You need to sacrifice a little and be smart about planning, but it can be done with the right major."
