53446,best usb c charging cable,Oh wow! Happened to me too just a few weeks back. Only noticed it because of the weird burnt smell it produced.
64778,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Boathouse is a great restaurant in general, though it is a bit pricey."
50678,best rap album,"Outside of the obvious (The off-season, Pray for Haiti), Haram, any of the Conway albums (I’ll name La Maquina as my fave), the plugs I met 2, TYRON, Roadrunner. Maybe not some of the best albums of all time (not the biggest brockhampton fan) but those are all really well-received albums"
60719,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I don't think I ever laugh as much as whenever I finally ""get"" the Burnt Chrysler jokes I read on reddit."
60884,Best comedy show on Netflix,Trailer Park Boys
28808,best breakfast foods,If you slice the bananas instead of mashing you get some excellent sugary roasted banana chunks! I love using frozen raspberries to add a little bit of tartness. And sliced almonds for a little texture!
54698,best water filter,"The 3-pack is like $23 right now, so that's $7.66 each."
68370,best science fiction novel,"Niven has interesting ideas, pulp execution and his biology sucks."
1121,best ice cream flavor,**Vanilla is the one true flavour! o/**
28632,best breakfast foods,The most common thing for a child or an adult to eat in The Netherlands for breakfast is sprinkles (we call it hagelslag) on bread with butter! And a nice cup of milk. And I just found out the Dutch consume about 14 million kilos hagelslag each year.
5802,best programming language for web development,"I'm going to disagree with PHP not being objectively bad as a programming language and framework. 

PHP violates Rule 0™ of being a good programming language: Make the job of the human using you as painless as you can. PHP has insane type coercion rules, terrible error reporting, no notion of modules, and fairly bad syntax. All of these issues could have easily been remedied if PHP had ever been given a proper design phase. 

The core framework is where the real crazy sets in. There is no convention for naming classes and functions, internal functions are exposed, and many functions simply do things that aren't what their name dictates. These are all basic things that implementors of a language should know to avoid. No modern language would be able to do this and expect to be adopted, but PHP's ubiquity makes it acceptable for some reason. 

PHP is ubiquitous and a fantastic employment opportunity, but it's certainly not good technology."
37389,best amusement park,"I went a few times back in 2018. Their houses aren't super scary compared to something like HHN at Universal, but they were decent and there were a lot of them. I don't know how it's going to be during COVID times, but at least then it was definitely enjoyable. They also have good shows during Howl-o-Scream and getting night rides on Apollo and Verbolten is always a plus."
40330,best midrange CPU,alright sweet thanks for checking!
37562,best amusement park,"It's subjective y'all. But I think the most well rounded park in Florida is Islands of Adventure. Best themed is Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom, and best coasters is Busch Gardens."
41786,movies like Inception,"The Machinist is great. One of the few movies I can actually call ""creepy""."
3567,best college for research,"1. do the colors look good on you? 

2. is the mascot scary? (im looking at you purdue boilermaker)

Anyone you can talk to that will be honest is a good source. Tours are really helpful or suck depending on what guide you get. Talk to someone you know going there if you can. Virtual student panels hosted by a specific group are good (ex engineering department, a sports team)"
27606,best bollywood actor,"I think he is good looking, but not very charming. Almost a little too model-esque"
17679,best iOS game,Legends of Runeterra if you’re into CCG’s. The game is very very generous with cards and rewards.
45266,best gaming system,"Thanks for the quick response. 

I don't know, I've heard great things about Red Dead Redemption.. 

Anything like that or driving games.

Something fun.. What do you like?"

63100,Best online React course,"Max updated his course on may 3rd, it's still that bad?"
8232,best toothpaste,"I'm a dentist and yes it is true brushing and flossing is THE most important part.  There are different types of ingredients in dentifrices (toothpastes) such as stannous fluoride that can be more abrasive as in the Crest TotalCare line, so not recommended for people with recession or sensitivity.  

Pro tip: if you have sensitive teeth Sensodyne is not the only brand for that, the active ingredient is potassium nitrate and is in a number of other dentifrices that are a little cheaper."
11355,best gifts for dad,Good ol' jack the dripper
69176,best major to study in college,Anything in STEM.
33162,best energy drink,"I find it pretty entertaining that Reddit people are dead-set against Energy drinks because they (Gasp!) have sugar and might cause cancer, but are perfectly ok with marijuana, LSD, and other hallucinogenic drugs."
