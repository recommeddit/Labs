5802,"I'm going to disagree with PHP not being objectively bad as a programming language and framework. 

PHP violates Rule 0™ of being a good programming language: Make the job of the human using you as painless as you can. PHP has insane type coercion rules, terrible error reporting, no notion of modules, and fairly bad syntax. All of these issues could have easily been remedied if PHP had ever been given a proper design phase. 

The core framework is where the real crazy sets in. There is no convention for naming classes and functions, internal functions are exposed, and many functions simply do things that aren't what their name dictates. These are all basic things that implementors of a language should know to avoid. No modern language would be able to do this and expect to be adopted, but PHP's ubiquity makes it acceptable for some reason. 

PHP is ubiquitous and a fantastic employment opportunity, but it's certainly not good technology.",best programming language for web development

I don't know how it's going to be during COVID times, but at least then it was definitely enjoyable. They also have good shows during Howl-o-Scream and getting night rides on Apollo and Verbolten is always a plus.",best amusement park

There are different types of ingredients in dentifrices (toothpastes) such as stannous fluoride that can be more abrasive as in the Crest TotalCare line, so not recommended for people with recession or sensitivity.  

Pro tip: if you have sensitive teeth Sensodyne is not the only brand for that, the active ingredient is potassium nitrate and is in a number of other dentifrices that are a little cheaper.",best toothpaste
