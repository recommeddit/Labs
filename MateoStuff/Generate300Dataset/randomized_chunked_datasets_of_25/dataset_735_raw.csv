"I do like when sites do updated lists for things like this. However, it seems like they are just saying for this budget, these are the options then listing any latest gen part in that price. Its more of best value for gaming at these price ranges, as let's be real, the 11900k and 5950x aren't listed cause they are priced higher than the rest here. But are infact the best cpus for gaming if you ignore price from each maker."
"Almond caramel, with piece of almond? Or extract ?"
Why? I think the first gen was the best.
The movie only gets good reviews because the twist. Its boring as fucking shit
"I really enjoyed Costa Rica - except for San Jose (one of the worst cities we visited - of the 75 odd we did around the world!!) but even it had some interesting communities. The towns we enjoyed were Monteverde, Uvita and San Isidro del General but never got to the north or coffee growing highlands. 
One thing I have learned is that people live in communities and even the “worst” countries/cities have some great communities. Most country related issues have little impact on ones day to day lifestyle."
Best is Chernobyl but not on Netflix.
"I was looking g for this comment. Both if those scents are amazing! Aventus is my main go to scent, and then switch to tweed when I fancy a change."
"history of the entire world, i guess

Relatively recent, but everyone should watch it."

"If you can get it for $550, it is a very good deal."
I don't think people realize that superhero movies weren't a Thing in 2002 when that first Spider-Man came out. It really was groundbreaking in a lot of ways.
Are you sick?  Dying? Have access to health care?

You don’t dry?
"I understand. Would you trust your American friends more than British ones? I'm not sure how long you lived in UK, but I'm generally curious. I also added a link to my other comment to elaborate what I mean by closer relationships."
"It also dries out your mouth, which can make it more prone to infection."
"[7 Springs Inn & Suites in Palm Springs, CA](http://www.palm-springs-hotels.cc/)  
Partially because I *LOVE* Palms Springs, but also the room was clean, updated, and had a kitchenette which we didn't expect. It is a little farther out of the way from downtown area, but I liked that it was quieter because of the location.

10/10 will stay there again."
"Sammy Baugh. 

But also Jim Brown, Jerry Rice, and Lawrence Taylor are right in there. 

(Rex Grossman isn't done yet)."

The Friend Zone / Happy Ever After Playlist - Abby Jiminez

Hating Game - Sally Thorne

Simple Wild - KA Tucker"
"I'm one of the scent as an accessory school of thought 

Smelling light and citrus when cuddling with a girl out in a corn field making smores around a bonfire on a chilly autumn night just feels to go against the grain if that makes sense, vs say, Givency Pi feels more appropriate.

That, or I just have not found the jack of all trades cologne yet."
Are Camels considered premiums now in the US?
Jesus christ absolutely. It is literally my favorite book I have ever read.
Just get a new battery for ur phone
"Why do people make sand sculptures? Digging holes is the same, just for less talented kids. Just lying around was something my parents did, but for me as a kid I was fucking bored by that. So after we ate something (my mom was strict with that don't go in the water after eating rule), I started to dig a hole and make a shitty fortress out of it"
"Agreed, I just noticed the DVD was out and I still haven't seen it.  I will check it out in the next few days.  I'm sure it's in RedBox."
