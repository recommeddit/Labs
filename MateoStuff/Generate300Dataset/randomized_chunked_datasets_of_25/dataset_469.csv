68376,best science fiction novel,"An interesting aspect of The Mote In God's Eye, which is easy to miss today, is how the humans use computers and manage information. They all have pocket computers, linked to a massive central network of facts, recordings, etc., and each room has a huge flat screen that they can use to look at shared information. It's basically how information technology works today.

But the book was published in 1974! Before Apple, before Microsoft, before the IBM PC. Niven and Pournelle once said that they considered all the computer stuff to be as fantastical as the idea of making contact with aliens."

15903,best sunglasses for fashion,It's very obvious. The acetate is certainly a higher grade. You can tell this pretty quickly from handling both brands. Of course I'm not commenting on luxottica vs non luxottica but this has been a hilariously misleading comment chain

43742,best items under $100,"I love really nice perfumes and have a collection of many luxury scents. My boyfriend makes sweet comments about how much he loves my perfumes and that he wants to get some nice cologne, but he didn't want to spend that much money on one. So, the other day he came with me to Sephora, and I was smelling and testing perfumes. He tested out a Dior cologne, really enjoyed it, but then realized the price. I could tell he really fancied that cologne, so I bought it right then and there for him. 

He tells me every day how much he loves it and all the compliments he gets. It may not be as cool or interesting as other things, but my boyfriend's joy was enough to make my heart happy. 

Edit: The cologne was Dior Sauvage"

2892,best headphones,"This. And for OP, if you want to have an amp to get the most out of future headphones (of which may or may not need more power), you can consider a few budget options: Schiit Hel, Schiit Fulla 4, iFi Zen DAC (or V2), FiiO K5 Pro, etc. All listed are DAC/AMP singular units, which act as a DAC and AMP all together. Not the best of both worlds but it's a great start and opens up many more headphone options. For gaming, get the Schiit Hel or Schiit Fulla 4 because they have a mic jack.

Disclaimer. I only own the iFi Zen DAC original, and I love it. Gives me plenty of volume with my HiFiMan HE400se (which I find meh for competitive gaming versus my Philips SHP9600)."

23451,best car racing video game,"I miss my Mazda MX5.

Why is it so fucking hard for EA to take NFS U2 and just make a revamp with the same mechanics, same upgrade choices, same customization etc, make modern graphics and charge a set price, and not have it packed with MTXs?

I mean seriously, it's fucking ridiculous.

That would be the best selling NFS since Underground 2, almost no doubt, because the original IS just so good."
