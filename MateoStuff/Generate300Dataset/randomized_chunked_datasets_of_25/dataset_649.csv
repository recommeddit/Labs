24498,">I've been meaning to get really into Gundam. Currently only 2 episodes into Zeta.

[Nice!](#rengehype) I assume you watched the original beforehand, have you seen any of the others yet?

> Btw i thought the TTGL movies were just glorified recaps. Is the second one really that great?

They are, but the second one has a lot more additions than the first one did (had a montage of stuff through [TTGL](/s ""the timeskip"") instead of it just *happening*, added some Nia characterization, and added a bit more Simon to the epilogue), [has its own remix of Sorairo Days](https://youtu.be/lyqFZFv3FcY), and the final battle somehow managed to be infinite times more hype than the final battle of the show was, which shouldn't be possible. Then again, doing the impossible is how Team Gurren rolls, so.",best anime

Not only did I learn react but the course had you first build an app in ES5 then convert it to ES6 so you got to learn that too, along with webpack in the pre create-react-app days. Was a fantastic resource. Unfortunately I think it's out of date so it's been removed from the site. Can't thank you enough Tyler.",Best online React course

She dragged me into this girly shop when she was visiting me a couple months back, and liked 2 things: a decorative vase for $100, and a set of salt and pepper shakers for $60. She said she couldn't get both and elected to get the shakers. Over the past few months, I have accidentally let slip that the store closed (locally owned, I said the owners moved out of state).

68107,"* Hyperion by Dan Simmons
* Diaspora by Greg Egan
* Starfish by Peter Watts
* House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds
* The Cyberiad by Stanislaw Lem

Hyperion felt like (and sort of is) six books rolled into one. The characters are fantastic and each of their tale fascinating and horrible to varying degrees. It's the only book on my list which I feel is an absolute must read.

Diaspora was surreal and dreamlike. Its themes are (non-romantic) love, humanity, loneliness, loss, and hope. It's difficult to talk about without spoiling it.

Starfish's atmosphere is amazing. It's about a group of outcasts being sent to live at the bottom of the ocean. People usually highlight how creepy the book was, but I found it to be a strangely comforting setting. I still think about it. And I kind of want to move there!

House of Suns is my favorite Reynolds novel. It's fairly optimistic when compared to Revelation Space. This is space opera on a huge scale. There are several scenes in House of Suns that will never leave me (especially the sectioning - yikes). I think it's the go-to novel for people who want to get introduced to Reynolds.

The Cyberiad... I can't describe it. I wouldn't make it justice. It's such a strange collection of stories, far from anything else I've read. It's sad to think how so many books are generic and interchangeable when you know that the potential of the genre is so much greater.",best science fiction novel
