There are, imo, *far* too many programmers who think that all computing is done on x86 systems with oodles of RAM, i.e. the machines they're using for development.

I walked into Best Buy one day to buy my brother an Xbox for Christmas that year for the holidays, and after eyeing that monitor for weeks I saw it at Best Buy on sale for $400. They didn’t have any models for me to take home but I made sure I bought one anyways. Thought I got it for a steal. Crazy how time flies",best gaming monitor
31772,"Hmm.  I haven't, but it's really hard not to.  They are some of the hottest girls you will find.  But hooking up with them is way too close for comfort.  They see you come and go everyday (and bring someone home from the bar).  They could potentially make your stay hell.  It's worse than hooking up with someone from work.  At least then , you don't see them at night....As for toiletries.  It's hard to consider it stealing when there's an endless supply.

Coincidentally, I've also worked for a company whose primary business is social media, and my lack of social media activity made no difference.
