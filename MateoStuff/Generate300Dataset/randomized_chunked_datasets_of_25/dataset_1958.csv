31232,best country to live in,I'd go for France
39252,best web browser,"The latest version of Firefox at the moment which is [88.0.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/88.0.1/releasenotes/) was released on May 5, 2021, that's a long way from 2017, don't you think? By the way, looking at the [Firefox (and Gecko) repo](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/), there are still a lot of changes, it doesn't seem to me to be an abandoned project."
4252,best text editor,":-)

There are, imo, *far* too many programmers who think that all computing is done on x86 systems with oodles of RAM, i.e. the machines they're using for development. (Though it's also true i've encountered C developers who seem to think that 'C standard library' and 'glibc' are synonymous, and apparently aren't aware of things like newlib .... )"
49024,best gaming monitor,"Jesus, is that what they go for now? Back when I build my rig in 2017. They were going for about $600 without taxes. I walked into Best Buy one day to buy my brother an Xbox for Christmas that year for the holidays, and after eyeing that monitor for weeks I saw it at Best Buy on sale for $400. They didn’t have any models for me to take home but I made sure I bought one anyways. Thought I got it for a steal. Crazy how time flies"
31772,best hotel to live in,"Hmm.  I haven't, but it's really hard not to.  They are some of the hottest girls you will find.  But hooking up with them is way too close for comfort.  They see you come and go everyday (and bring someone home from the bar).  They could potentially make your stay hell.  It's worse than hooking up with someone from work.  At least then , you don't see them at night....As for toiletries.  It's hard to consider it stealing when there's an endless supply.

Edit: typo"
52453,best hiphop album,Didn't read?? Ok then...
15396,best tree for the garden,Yggdrasil hands down.
22708,best celebrity,"Rupert is king. His first big purchase was an old ice cream truck, which he drives around fully stocked and hands out free ice cream (he's not allowed to sell it without a vending licence). He brought it to the last day of filming on Harry Potter while the crew was having a barbecue."
31714,best hotel to live in,">They're called hookers

Please. They're hired companions.

    We only call them hookers when they're dead and in the trunk of a car..."
45808,best trick or treating candy,"Best: Reese's

Worst: Apples. COME ON, neighbor. Apples are not candy!

Also, Candy Corn.

Basically anything mildly produce-related is sooo not Halloweenie."
27101,best board games,I'm a little surprised Carcassonne isn't on here
52837,best hiphop album,"Hell yeah, dude. Stillmatic gets slept on impo."
47141,best state to visit in the United States,"Internal flight to San Fran. 

Cost around £1,600 including the trips."
1482,best ice cream flavor,Mmmm that must be good!  Will have to try this one too!
62463,Best RPG game on PS4,"Even more stoked to play it.  I bought it and haven’t been able to start it yet, and I’m out of town for a few days - so it’ll be waiting for me when I get back!"
64516,Best Nike running shoes,I almost tl;dr before even clicking through! You need to change 'extremely long' to 'extremely thorough'  in your post title. It doesn't sound too appealing otherwise.
57873,best cologne,Just some advice: colognes and perfumes smell different on everyone. It mixes with your skin smell/personal scent/pheromones. I always go try a few on before buying new perfume. Wait a few minutes after dabbing it on your skin and the smell will be different than if you just spray it in the air.
63057,Best online React course,Oups I meant this tuto https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d
45187,best items under $100,"This. I have some shure se215s, they're far from being the best headphones in the world, but they kick the shit out of crappy apple earbuds and the like. Music is so much more enjoyable with them."
22003,best celebrity,Also came here to say that Steven Tyler is super nice. I met him on the street in New York as a kid and he talked to me for a long while about Aerosmith and then asked me to take his picture and did a bunch of goofy poses.
19370,best YouTube video,"And now when he's doing streams twice a week and explaining those topics... Well, it's quite helpful"
55002,best water filter,"adding to this (instead of starting a new thread), how often should the filters *really* be changed? mine has a little light that turns red when it's time to change the filter but it went from green to red in only 4 weeks time. i can't afford to keep buying the damn things but i want ice cold drinking water so i keep using the thing anyway. what's the consensus on this?"
23175,best social networking site for CS,"The only ""social media"" accounts I have is LinkedIn and Reddit.   LinkedIn I've only ever treated it like a resume site.  My reddit account cannot be easily traced by to my real-world identity, and I'd lie my ass off before ever revealing my account name to employers.

Coincidentally, I've also worked for a company whose primary business is social media, and my lack of social media activity made no difference.

edit:  If anything, my lack of Social media activity is probably a good thing for most employers, as I'm not spending time on Facebook, when I should be working."
