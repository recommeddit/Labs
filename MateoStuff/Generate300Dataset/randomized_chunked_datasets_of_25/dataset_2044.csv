33219,best electric car,"That's why I said to check where you are. Where I am and where I go, there are far more CCS chargers than Superchargers - but as I said, that isn't true everywhere. 

There's nothing wrong with buying a Tesla, I just look forward to not being dependent on their walled charging garden."

40309,best midrange CPU,"The 5700xt is probably overkill as you say for just 1080p gaming.

RTX is nvidias dedicated Ray tracing hardware. Currently it's mostly just a marketing gimmick and imho isn't worth the extra cost. If you'd rather buy an nvidia gpu go for a 1660 super.

As you say the 3600 or 3600x is your best value cpu atm. Ryzen 4000 is still months away so up to you if you want to wait. The difference between the 3600 and 3600x is the 3600x has a bigger cooler and slightly higher clock. Most people think it's not worth the extra money but imho if the difference is only 20 bucks it doesn't really matter."

22869,best celebrity,"I was at a shoe store in cleveland about 4 years ago. . I think it was Finishline.    And I'm looking at the new Lebron shoes, (mind you that I'm only 18 at the time), and a huge shadow appears over me.  And i turn around, and it was Lebron fucking James standing there.   He smiled and said ""you want my new shoes"" I stumbled over my words for a few seconds then said yes I think I'm going to buy a pair right now.   He then asked me my size, went up to the front desk and bought me 2 pairs.   1 he signed, and he said the other was for me to practice my post moves in.   One of the best days of my life."
68847,best science fiction novel,You're looking for humorous Utopian SF? Have you heard about *Blindsight*?
26896,best board games,"Just as one counterpoint:

[Gloomhaven plays this month](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven/stats): 2,224 (yes, that many plays in just the first 1/3rd of the month)

And it continues to be in the top 10 most played games on BGG even 3 years after its release.

Of course there's a lot of quibbling to be had over BGG plays data but.. at least its data. And not all the games in the top 10 make it to the table that much, but they're all still making it to the table regularly. So you can make whatever sweeping determinations about the reasons for people's rankings you like, but uh, I'd say that the reason these games are still rated so highly is because people are still playing them."

33239,best electric car,"F-150 range was not calculated while pulling a trailer. Just put that thought out of your mind. Some reports claim it's with 1000 lbs ""on board"", i.e. in the bed, but even that is sketchy. And a half ton in the bed wouldn't make much difference on the highway, anyway, which is where range matters.

I've not seen one reliable report of 400 mile range, just speculation. Look at the price of each Mach E variant, then add 6-12k of extra battery cost to get the same range in F-150."

8672,best toothpaste,"No but I worked in a Dental research clinic for a few years as a lab tech/Data Analyst for studies that covered this exact topic, and had some long interesting conversations with the Dentist running the study about it. He doesn't not recommend using any cosmetic whiting paste that contain abrasives. Silica and other similar abrasives will cause permanent damage leading to more decay later. Interestingly, one of the pastes were were studying, was seeking to be a replacement for what was supposed to be a safer enamel abrasive, which contained microplastic balls that were far less abrasive. However they were discontinuing them, for good reason due to risks of harm to the environment/aquatic life where the plastics would eventually end up, they also were embedding in peoples gums, especially people with forms of gum disease that loosen around the base of the teeth."
