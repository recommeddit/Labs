44710,best items under $100,"Kobo mini e-reader: bought it in 2013 on sales for £30, so I guess around $50. Took me a while to adapt from physical books, but now I read 20-30 books a year and all of them are for free from the digital public library. The size of the reader is very tiny and I can put it in the pocket of my jacket and take it with me when I go out for walks. Also very useful for when I (used to) travel and go to holidays as I can pack a lot of books."

29220,best web hosting service,"If there are minimal traffic, then try the hosts in side bar, offering hosting for as low as 5 dollars per month. Alternatively Wordpress.com, 3 dollars per month."
28818,best breakfast foods,"I make a pan of egg casserole on Sundays and eat it all week. It's just 12 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tbsp olive oil, cheese, and whatever veggies you want to throw in. 375F for like 35 minutes (sorry for all the non-metric units). The whole thing costs less than $10 in the states. If you want it to be handheld you can get a storebought crust and make them into little quiche type dishes. It's very cheap and very easy to make.

Edit: for best results, throw the eggs in a food processor for about a minute. It makes the casserole crazy-awesome-fluffy. Also, I think eggs are one of those items that you really improve your experience by buying top shelf product. You can get a dozen for $1.50, or you can get one for $6 (direct from a farmer if you have the option). The $6 dozen is  significantly tastier, and it's still a great deal for the amount of protein you're getting.

Double edit: don't put tomatoes in unless you squeeze out their moisture first. It will make the whole thing runny."

43061,best detective show,Gonna chuck in another vote for The Killing. The first mystery dragged in parts as it did span two seasons (I think mystery dramas should be 8-12 episodes at most) but otherwise it was great.
