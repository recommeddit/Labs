44710,"Kobo mini e-reader: bought it in 2013 on sales for £30, so I guess around $50. Took me a while to adapt from physical books, but now I read 20-30 books a year and all of them are for free from the digital public library. The size of the reader is very tiny and I can put it in the pocket of my jacket and take it with me when I go out for walks. Also very useful for when I (used to) travel and go to holidays as I can pack a lot of books.",best items under $100

28818,"I make a pan of egg casserole on Sundays and eat it all week. It's just 12 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1 tbsp olive oil, cheese, and whatever veggies you want to throw in. 375F for like 35 minutes (sorry for all the non-metric units). The whole thing costs less than $10 in the states. If you want it to be handheld you can get a storebought crust and make them into little quiche type dishes. It's very cheap and very easy to make.

Edit: for best results, throw the eggs in a food processor for about a minute. It makes the casserole crazy-awesome-fluffy. Also, I think eggs are one of those items that you really improve your experience by buying top shelf product. You can get a dozen for $1.50, or you can get one for $6 (direct from a farmer if you have the option). The $6 dozen is  significantly tastier, and it's still a great deal for the amount of protein you're getting.

Double edit: don't put tomatoes in unless you squeeze out their moisture first. It will make the whole thing runny.",best breakfast foods
