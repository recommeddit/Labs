69605,"My mom did something similar, she didn't know what to major in but didn't want to be undecided so closed her eyes and pointed to a random major, her plan was to start the general requirements and figure out what she wanted to major in later. Never found anything she wanted to major in, so she ended up graduating with her random degree, and she's now been an RN for 25 years while still trying to figure out what she wanted to do. Telling this story I'm realizing where my extreme indecisiveness came from.",best major to study in college

31351,"I think it might be due to the fact that the US has so many great higher education schools. Our education system might not be the greatest and it might not have ""smarter"" students compared to that of Korea or Germany. However, with schools from the Ivy League and such, their ranking will definitely get inflated.

Health might also be related to this too since US has probably the best hospitals in the world. Access to these hospitals? Probably not the best and super expensive. But if you have access, you're probably in the best hands. 

It might not be the best methodology but that's probably where they're coming from.",best country to live in

70298,Same. I was a high school dropout and was heavily into drugs and alcohol... Was in and out of prison for years and ended up in a horticulture class while doing my last prison sentence. I found I actually enjoyed learning and now I'm back in school with four years off drugs and alcohol. I'm about to get my AA degree and just sent in my application for University. It's never too late and I feel like I learned a ton of lessons over those 15 years that no school could ever teach me. The University I'm applying for has a program where I can get my MBA in 3 more years and I'm excited what the future has to offer.,best major to study in college

73253,"Does your laptop allow Dual-Boot? If so Lubuntu is a minimal desktop Ubuntu derivative.

Ubuntu is good because:

* Stable Debian-like package manager so nice and easy to use command line to download packages you need from repositories.
* LTS
* Loads of google ""Ubuntu help"" eg forums etc that help with any problems

Worth knowing about:

* Fedora is very professional support
* MX Linux is very attractive new entry (excellent performance)
* Elementary OS is Ubuntu derivative that has wonderful desktop (Mac inspired iirc)

Those are also strong contenders.",best Linux distro
