69605,best major to study in college,"My mom did something similar, she didn't know what to major in but didn't want to be undecided so closed her eyes and pointed to a random major, her plan was to start the general requirements and figure out what she wanted to major in later. Never found anything she wanted to major in, so she ended up graduating with her random degree, and she's now been an RN for 25 years while still trying to figure out what she wanted to do. Telling this story I'm realizing where my extreme indecisiveness came from."
42274,movies like Inception,Great movie and excellent cast. Joan Cusack's performance was especially memorable.
31351,best country to live in,"I think it might be due to the fact that the US has so many great higher education schools. Our education system might not be the greatest and it might not have ""smarter"" students compared to that of Korea or Germany. However, with schools from the Ivy League and such, their ranking will definitely get inflated.

Health might also be related to this too since US has probably the best hospitals in the world. Access to these hospitals? Probably not the best and super expensive. But if you have access, you're probably in the best hands. 

It might not be the best methodology but that's probably where they're coming from."

16714,best pet for toddlers,Aren't they really energetic? Why do you think they are the best?
36659,best alcoholic drink,"A Manhattan is technically a sweet drink but it's very, *very* booze-forward. If you don't like to taste alcohol, I'd probably hold off on trying one. Anecdotal evidence-- was recommended a Manhattan on my 21st bday. Chugged it because I hated it, then puked it up about 30 minutes later."
72947,best Linux distro,"Just like everyone has said, to play hacker, specially after Mr Robot aired.

If someone is serious, I prefer Parrot by a mile. Nice experience overall and more actually useful features unique to it. Cool fookin logo too, mate."

70298,best major to study in college,Same. I was a high school dropout and was heavily into drugs and alcohol... Was in and out of prison for years and ended up in a horticulture class while doing my last prison sentence. I found I actually enjoyed learning and now I'm back in school with four years off drugs and alcohol. I'm about to get my AA degree and just sent in my application for University. It's never too late and I feel like I learned a ton of lessons over those 15 years that no school could ever teach me. The University I'm applying for has a program where I can get my MBA in 3 more years and I'm excited what the future has to offer.

21195,best workout music,"I tend to listen to the music the gym radio plays, it's not bad. Except when zumba class starts and the entire building explodes by the volume of their music. Most music I play from my ipod is DnB and just plain instrumentals."

73253,best Linux distro,"Does your laptop allow Dual-Boot? If so Lubuntu is a minimal desktop Ubuntu derivative.

Ubuntu is good because:

* Stable Debian-like package manager so nice and easy to use command line to download packages you need from repositories.
* LTS
* Loads of google ""Ubuntu help"" eg forums etc that help with any problems

Worth knowing about:

* Fedora is very professional support
* MX Linux is very attractive new entry (excellent performance)
* Elementary OS is Ubuntu derivative that has wonderful desktop (Mac inspired iirc)

Those are also strong contenders."
28328,best breakfast foods,"During the week an egg sandwich (or if I sleep in a banana), the weekend home fries and scrambled eggs, the impress a girl breakfast is a Benedict or banana pancakes.  Eggs Benedict is easy as fuck but seems like a lot of work, and Banana pancakes, everyone loves them and if you don't I don't think we can work out.  Sorry, I can get you an uber but you have to wait outside. 

Oh if I have any old French bread and I remember the night before I'll make French toast."
6759,best iPhone,I got my 8 plus the weekend after launch and I’m still using it because it’s literally the best phone I’ve ever owned. Like I’m going to keep it until it either stops working or it stops getting updates.
69710,best major to study in college,"I think a lot of students get ""stuck"" in bio because they started off as premed, got a C in chemistry, realized they aren't competitive for med school, but they're 2 years in and don't want to switch majors because they already have so many bio classes completed. I'm teaching intro bio and 90% of my students are pre-med. Maybe  1/5 of them will get into med school? :("
