49556,best gaming monitor,Oh I was referring to the currency. I was obviously just kidding.
39183,best web browser,Brave.
33769,best electric car,"I want to see more range-extender options.  Commute-range battery + range extender for road trips.  Something like GM's Voltec is ideal.

I could charge at work and at various public charging stations but cannot charge at home, and I take too many long trips to deal with charging on the road, so BEVs are a non-starter for me."
4969,best home improvement store,"I used to work for Lowe’s for 10 years till this past January as a millwork specialist. Lowe’s does not care who they hire. I can swear to you the only hire people to fill in for coverage. You might have a few good full timers but half the departments will be empty staffed or being covered by a kid who’s in lumber and also covering millwork and hardware at the same time, who’s being payed probably 12-13$ a hour."
5152,best home improvement store,This is the third time I've seen that in this thread.  I need to pay more attention.
53345,best usb c charging cable,I have a 64 GB USB C memory stick that I use for transferring of photos. I can't plug that in to my phone
41144,best instrument to play,"I would recommend picking something you can play by yourself.  Bass and drums are cool, but can get a little boring without people to play with.  Piano and guitar are great solo instruments and you can play them for hours at a time.

Also, think about which instrument are you drawn to the most?  If you can't decide, then think about what music or songs you want to play.  Then ask which instrument will best play."

46532,best trick or treating candy,Jagged rectangle.
16056,best sunglasses for fashion,"I ruin sunglasses very quickly (I stuff them in my purse and they always get scratched), so I usually buy several at a time for less than $10 a pair. I'm really in love with a pair of yellow heart-shaped frames I got for like $6."
60303,best freezer brand,It will cost about $40-60 a year to operate depending on your electric rate.
33042,best energy drink,The UK and Europe.  I’ll swap you the full sugar version any day.
26890,best board games,How Euro-y does Brass feel to play? I'm crazy interested in this game but my group tends to get bored with games if there's not enough excitement going on.
19779,best workout music,"Came here to say this, very happy someone beat me to it. 

Also, Killer Mikes album RAP Music is an excellent pre-RTJ soundtrack, and is produced by El-P so it has a sort of proto-RTJ feel. Absolutely worth checking out."

53555,best medicine for a cold,"Yep, was scrolling to see if anyone pointed that out. I have to take antihistamines every morning (yay for allergies and mysterious autoimmune nonsense), usually Claritin or Zyrtec, and they don't make me drowsy at all. Something like Benadryl will definitely make most people pretty sleepy, but that's not a feature of all antihistamines."
