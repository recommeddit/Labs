8956,"I read through like every comment in this thread an came up with this:

* Baking soda is an abrasive

* Fluoride is what makes a toothpaste any good

* Brushing without toothpaste is fine if you don't need the fluoride

* Pretty much all toothpastes other than those used to fight sensitive teeth are the same in terms of quality.

* Most effective way to whiten teeth by far is through a dentist.

* My Colgate Total probably doesn't really shield my teeth for 12 hours. (damn...)",best toothpaste

6071,"Hello! I'm a big documentary watcher. My suggestions are fairly true crime heavy, those tend to be the ones that stick to me. I hope that you find something that interests you! Sometimes I'll just browse through r/documentaries and see what pops up. They have a lot that are free on YouTube. 

NETFLIX:


How to Fix a Drug Scandal- follows the story of 2  chemists from  drug testing labs. Their jobs are to test if evidence is a drug or not. Things spiral from there and I found the story fascinating. Binged the whole docuseries in a day

Sour Grapes- watched this one a while ago and have since rewatched. Documentary is centered around a new guy on the fine wine scene. Going to auctions and buying up hundreds of thousands of dollars of wine. Something isn't right here...

Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez- famous story of a man killed. Looks into the effects of repeated brain injuries and if they cause a person to do things they wouldn't normally do. I didn't know much about this case going into it and it kept my interest. Binged docuseries in a day. 

Blackfish- if you haven't watched it yet I do recommend it. Story is well known, the terrible treatment of orcas in captivity. Some of it is shocking, even if you feel like you know it all... it may surprise you. 

HULU: ( I hope this is ok, I know a lot of the time people do have both streaming services)



Susan Powell, an ID Murder Mystery- flat out shocking, horrible, tragic story of a woman murdered. Things I cannot unhear. Recommended if you have the emotional strength for a truly heartwrenching story. 

An American Murder Story, Scott Peterson- docuseries following the murder of pregnant woman, Lacy Peterson. Also obviously heartbreaking. Case is very interesting and kept me watching. Binge watch for sure. 

An American Murder Story, Casey Anthony- obviously an enraging story. I recommend all the American murder stories, they are well told and engrossing. While absolutley awful and tragic. 

Last recommendation, though not on streaming services. Deep Web. The riveting story of the Silk Road and the man who created it.",best Netflix documentary

However, I do think starting with Island helps ease the transition to Pandemic by teaching you the basic formula; then pandemic teaches you more fundamentals of “deeper” board games (much wider pool of actions and number of actions per turn, much more value in movement efficiency and utilizing your special ability, etc) so I don’t think it’s bad to have both — especially for new gamers. However, if you have some experience in gaming already I’d suggest just going with Pandemic",best board games
