22378,"I had a chance to work with Witney Houston for eight days on a film set. I was working as an extra. She was nice, kind and personable. Her beauty was more striking in person. 

She was very professional she did not miss a mark or a cue. Everybody on the set cried when she sang. Whitney Houston was very nice to me and complimentary she spoke sweetly and in a motherly tone when she greeted people. I can still rememer her friendly greetings when she arrived on set every day.

That was one of best experiences of my life and best experiences working on a film set. I learned a lot from her about professionalisim on a film set. I also saw how hard she worked. She was there twelve hours a day and on point every minute. I watched how she interacted with the director other actors and crew. She was even encouraging to other actors and performers in the film even the extras.

It was heartbreaking when she passed. I still have the dress that I wore in that film she admired and complimented me about the dress. An actor/ musician I know was booked to perform at the event Whitney Houston was to be at the day she passed he was also staying at the same hotel. He called me and told me she was gone then he started to cry.",best celebrity

64803,"There really isn't any exceptional restaurants if you are comparing to major metro areas like LA/SF. With that said, there are some good places.

- Lucky Penny/Les Marchands/Lark are all owned by the same group and are all very good
- Arigato for sushi. Sakana is pretty good too, but my vote goes to Arigato.
- Sama Sama with cocktails before hand at good lion is a good pairing
- Honor Bar in Montecito is really solid

""Same thing I've always wanted. Lego.""  
""But you have all the Legos (it's not LegoS, it's Lego, but whatever) you want.""

54572,"> on. If you're just looking for something solid and can get an Aqua control plus cheaper, I'd probably do that. Ac+ is my universal pick for something other than artisan, but truly I think one big purchase of artisan gets you into end game 👍. Thanks! yea i know I would use it for a long time so it seems kind of worth it but it still feels hard to justify.
