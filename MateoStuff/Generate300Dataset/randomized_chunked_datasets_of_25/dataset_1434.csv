44786,best items under $100,Looks different from what I can tell - It says it contains mineral pellets of some sort. Anyone else want to weigh in? I’d be very curious if this would be a good detergent alternative.
4676,best home improvement store,"I've bought multiple appliances from lowes, because they have a price match plus 10 percent off deal. 

Each time, I've found the appliance priced lower somewhere else and done the price match. 

Then, when I go to the front to pay, I usually have a HD 10% coupon that they will match as well. (you can get these from setting up your move with the post office). 

I end up with my appliance for price match plus 20% off."
