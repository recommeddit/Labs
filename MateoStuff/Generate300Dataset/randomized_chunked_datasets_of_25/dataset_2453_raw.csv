"The most important thing you can do to ensure efficient use of your time is engage in **self-reflection** simply because it allows you to analyze how you actually used your time. Once you consciously see how you use your time, you can figure out what habits you want to drop and what is using up most of your time, almost like doing a ""Six Sigma"" project on your life. 

The tricky part is changing those habits and identifying how your **emotions and your subconscious drive your actions**. Two absolute must reads for this are:

* Psycho Cybernetics - Maxwell Maltz (I found this title very off-putting but its a well-written, logical book with concrete examples. You will not regret giving it a chance)

* Think and Grow Rich - Napolean Hill"
"I concur - another nice thing about piano is that it provides an excellent structure for learning music theory, which will advance your compositional skills. Additionally, the flexibility in sound generation you gain when you use keyboards will give you an enormous range. 

I'd suggest guitar as your second instrument - this will give you a very different angle on theory and widen the range of your compositions."
Ok but why biologically. Contaminants are a thing.

"A docu-series called Age of Samurai just came out. No idea if its good though, anyone seen it yet?"
But my nose is already broken...

"Agreed on Schoshe, they are selling certified cables."
"Hi, if you want a 2-in-1, the HP Envy x360 is definitely viable, but you'll likely have to go over budget. You could consider the Lenovo Flex 5 14"" on my list as a cheaper 2-in-1 option. Otherwise, if you want something as future proof as possible, a gaming laptop like the [**Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/product/lenovo-ideapad-gaming-3-15-6-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-5600h-8gb-ram-512gb-ssd-rtx-3060-6gb-gddr6-shadow-black/) would be a good choice. It has better upgradability and stronger specs."

"Hopefully, this doesn't get buried but, [RNAi in C. elegans, work which Fire and Mello recieved a Nobel for in 2006](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v391/n6669/pdf/391806a0.pdf) 

While not the best it is still pretty well written. I think it would be a beneficial exercise to have the class, read and critique the content, writing style ect.  Of course, you get discussion going and the more critical the class is, the more of a shock you get when you reveal that they won a Nobel for the work.  

This is how this paper was presented to me in a class.  It really did a lot in the way of teaching us that papers in high tier journals are not perfect, and moreover that Nobel prize winning work is not perfect.  You also get the opportunity to speculate on the implications of their work at that period in time which is fun!  

Maybe this outside the realm of your class but maybe not?"
"I used to use `axios` in node.js and in react projects, but I've been using `fetch` more and more, specifically `isomorphic-unfetch` for Next.js projects. Since some of your Next.js code will run on the front end or the back end depending on the context, the code has to work in both cases. `isomorphic-unfetch` uses `unfetch` when running in node and native `fetch` when running in the browser."
"So mine hasn't worn down, but I have a ton of pads. I've probably only put a few weeks into it. I do hear shidenkai does this though, it'll slow down a good amount over time. That's the drawback to it unfortunately.

If you want to avoid that try the Raiden! It's nearly as fast and has much better durability!"
mmmm teefers
"Well, I must say you really seem to know your stuff and you've done a fine job!

I'm suburban Minnesotan born and bred, there is a certain brand of ""don't be trashy/high strung/but don't notice me too much"" common to a lot of similar geographic areas though!"
Whatever is cold and free.
"if you like old games, need for speed underground 2 and most wanted bring back many memories to me."
"Sweden, Norway or Texas"
"The 9600k is at a good price right now, and if youre willing to overclock in 5 to 6 years it will last even longer in terms of performance."
"Honestly... Ed Hardy. 

My dad bought it for me when I was maybe 23 not knowing what douchey connotations the brand has, turns out chicks dig it."
OP wants a long cable. The one you linked is only 3 feet. You can't get anything longer than 3 feet with a cable that supports 3.1.
"I have the same exact thing, does it fade away as you run more? Maybe will exchange them as well."
"Stop being a genre nazi. Of course it qualifies based on ops criteria. Hell, Temple of Doom has just about as much romance.

Also, downvoting any rec that isn't an Indiana Jones movie, the one series that has a 99% chance ops already seen them? This sub is dumb right now."
"With 20ah, not too high in capacity but high in power, compact and passthrough (i believe): the new baseus blade powerbank. 100w in and output on usb-c and has 4 ports in total."
