54459,best artisan mousepad alternatives,What numbers would you give the Hien soft on this scale?
16024,best sunglasses for fashion,"Sunglasses mean an opportunity for me to wear whatever ridiculously coloured, odd shaped pair makes me happiest. I'm totally prepared to pretend that they were all that was available at a gas station and it was an emergency. Price wouldn't matter, but I don't want my sunglasses to be serious and the name brand ones often are. Unfortunately, I've graduated to prescription lenses only and my sunglasses purchases are much less spontaneous."

69152,best major to study in college,"Mostly true I think. I go to an engineering and science driven school. Many of my friends are in these majors and are very good at it. I on the other hand am so terrible at math and have always longed for a creative career. I will be graduating with a graphic design degree. I wish my brain was good at math. But this is definitely better suited for me. You shouldn't just follow the money because not everyone can be good being a doctor or engineer.

Although you still gotta look at what you can make a living off of and be realistic.
In my case a graphic design degree is much better option than a integrated studio arts degree of painting, ceramics, sculpture etc.)
Thank God I love it too :)"

62822,Best Data Science textbook,"This is not straight a DS book, but  I just found 'fluent python' by Ramalho to be fantastic. It explains many intrincate tradeoffs in data structures and algos that you would expect to appear only in (harder) theorethical CS books. 

&#x200B;

And it can be read out of order. Like a coffee book. I read it in the train.

&#x200B;

It can move your python skills up a notch or two. It's that good.

40990,best instrument to play,"Piano, by far.

It requires zero skill to produce a good sound on a piano, unlike the flute, trumpet, saxophone, viola... Lots of instruments require a fair amount of practice just to make *a* sound, let alone a *good* sound.

The piano is also more visual than other instruments. Every note looks unique and is easy to remember and identify. Not true with most other instruments.

That said, playing the piano at a high level is *not* easy. But learning it is. There's a reason most music schools require piano proficiency for every student, regardless of their principal instrument."

67015,best places to skydive in california,"For future info... Boogies are not great places to go to stay current or get current. You have a drop zone that is much busier and with larger planes and more people in the air than normal.   

It is also the WORST place to demo new gear - More people in the air, more stuff going on, more people who are not used to the DZ.  

Some people will claim I am wrong.... But they will be unable to explain why a boogie is a SAFER place than a normal DZ weekend. They will instead try to claim, ""It is not that big of a deal""...."

73556,best battery bank,True. I figure the fast charging benefit comes from (less) time spent in towns. For the Anker 10ks at least it looks like PD vs non-PD is about 0.65oz.
