The name of the podcast is genius.

They have great customer service as well!
That sounds like fun! But where can I get puppies at this late hour?

My stomach never adapted well to a lot of liquid considering I take protien twice a day.  I usually throw in some powdered oats for fiber and it helps immensely.

"It’s heartbreaking, don’t watch it if you don’t think it’s something you can handle. I had to stop it several times and that was years after knowing the full story and it was still hard to watch."

They’re cheaters. If Cedar Point was backed by government funding they’d have 5 gigas by now
I was legitimately surprised by Sound of My Voice.
"yep, None of my iphones, 3G, 4S, or SE1 have ever slowed down. It's apps become bloated, demanding more. Snapchat used to work on the iphone  3G when it came out before it became extremely bloated with junk"
"Well, he picked you up..."
"Unlike many other old (Emacs) or young (Atom, VSCode, etc.) editors, and unlike every IDE ever, Vim's architecture has never really been designed with extensibility in mind. It just doesn't have what it takes to be a *platform* so you get hack-ish plugins that compete with each others for mappings and CPU cycles.

"Nikki Sixx went to high school with my parents and was one of my moms best friends at that time.

I got to hang out in his dressing room when they had their first reunion tour. He's a really nice, humble dude. I wouldn't go as far as to say he's immature, but he was very boyish and teenager like. But I guess that's kind of what happens when you become a famous rock star at the age of 19. You never have to grow up."
