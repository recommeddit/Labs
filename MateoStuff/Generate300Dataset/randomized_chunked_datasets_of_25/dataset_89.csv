46696,best hand santizer brand,"Look into the Boxed app and ""sign up"" for notifications  for when items are back in stock. They go quickly but I've gotten 4 notifications in the past 2-3 weeks. They may not be name brand, but it looks like they are selling two, 75 wipe containers."

65153,best phone service company,"If you have a 5G phone, T-Mobile is likely the best.  If not, Verizon still wins.  So far T-Mobile is the only carrier to have widely deployed 5G on dedicated frequencies."

These games are all very simple to pickup and most people, gamer or not, will enjoy them. Covers a lot of genres and player counts. Many of these are ‚Äúgateways‚Äù or ‚Äúfillers‚Äù, but they will still be worth owning even after you move on to more complex games."

21950,best celebrity,"When I met him, he seemed a bit overwhelmed by the enthusiasm around him, but he was still great. He wanted to take silly pictures with me and I was like, ‚ÄúHOLY SHIT TYRION WANTS TO TAKE PICTURES WITH MEH.‚Äù Great dude."
48992,best gaming monitor,"One caveat to the monitor is its mediocre performance at 60hz refresh rate. It's very likely, depending on your GPU and what kind of games you play, that you will be playing some games closer to 60hz than 100+ (if you're planning 1440p ultra).

I was going to go with the TUF because of the price and despite the mediocre 60hz performance, but then the BenQ EX2770q went on sale for basically the same price as the TUF, which has far better 60hz performance. 

Honestly OP there's no such thing as the ""best"" gaming monitor. Every single panel has its benefits and drawbacks. The only panels I consider unsuitable for gaming are VA panels. I have yet to see a VA panel that has consistent gray-to-gray response rate; that's why they're notorious for ghosting/smearing."

31391,best country to live in,"Bro but you wouldn't be paying my bills for me. The fact you look at it that way is fucked. You'd be paying a thing like social security. 

This isn't MY bills that would be getting paid. My cellphone wouldn't be paid by you, my car insurance is still mine, my rent is my responsibility. 

What you would do by agreeing to the Christian virtue of helping your neighbor is make my life easier. You wouldn't solve all my problems, you'd just make it so when my kid gets sick I can afford to see a doctor and not fall behind on my bills. You'd make it so I wouldn't have to worry about my kids education so I could pay my bills and they would still have a future by being guarenteed a college education. 

By deciding to help pay for others, you wouldn't be alleviating my poverty. I'd still be making the same amount of money, and, again, you wouldn't be paying my bills. That's on me. What you would be doing is making poverty less bad. You'd make being poor here better than being poor elsewhere. 

You would be paying to make America as a whole stronger and better. That's not paying my bills for me. That's caring about the state of your country and fellow countrymen, WHICH IS AN INTRINSIC DUTY OF EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN.

That's how a democracy works. It's everyone's responsibility to uphold society, and yes that means making sure others can access basic needs like healthcare and education. 

If you can't see that, then you have absolutely ZERO understanding of what it means to be American, you have absolutely no idea of your civic responsibilities as an American, and you are part of the reason we are no longer United. 

You should be ashamed of yourself. You give all Americans a bad name you selfish prick. 

This is coming from a United States Marine: Fuck yourself"
37398,best amusement park,"HHN if you are looking for a legit Halloween event. Knoebels or one of the Herschend parks if you want a fall festival type event, some smaller parks do these pretty well and can be charming.

38524,best newspapers to read,"I read the newspaper (Dutch newspaper NRCnext, for those interested.) every day of the week, unless it's delivered late. I have to leave the house at 7:00 every day, which means I have 20 minutes to read the newspaper. It is delivered by an old couple, and when the weather is bad they are sometimes late. I curse those mornings.


Then I read a free newspaper (the METRO) every day on my way to university, and a different newspaper on the way back home. In the evening I'll finish my morning newspaper.


In the weekend I read the Saturday issue of the NRC newspaper. When I can (get my hands on it), I try to read The Guardian or the New York Times. I love holding those newspapers."
