And remember this?
"TIL I should give my BF a blowjob and then leave for the day as a gift. 

Edit: Thanks for the Gold! For the record, my SO is looking forward to the next gift-giving occasion, where everything is the same except I have to go sit at McDonalds and drink coffee for six hours."
Important to note that a 50/50 Gatorade/water mix is crucial for optimal use. Try it next time.
"I got `vifm` and set it up when I switched to Arch, but nowadays I do almost all of my file management directly in the terminal."
"Huawei mate 10 had pretty good battery but it’s older now. My most recent one was the Moro g7 power, i didn’t have to charge it at night and could play games during the day endlessly. I got that phone just for the battery life since everything else about it was meh but great for the price ($150). Still, I wish I had a 5000 mah in my iPhone even if that meant it had to be a little chunky"
"Lots of good stocks to consider in this thread. I'll go with GOOG, SHOP, NVDA, CRM and ADBE."
For beginners?
"Air58/UL2, XM1, then GPW. But all very good. Thanks for the sub man I appreciate it. Thought I’d do a write-up to switch up the medium a think through the same stuff in a different way. Looking forward to getting the hati in and taking a look. Long overdue."

"I’ll have to take a look, thanks for the suggestions!"
"I'm always satisfied by the accuracy and up-to-date nature of Circa News, but it is fairly liberal leaning.
Edit: you know what, I take back what I said about its political leanings. It uses so many different sources that it really does cover all the bases. I think I just read the liberal subject stories more :)"
"I also have a Parkside. Really nice bag as well. Some guy in the Zurich airport tried buying it off of me. No thanks, not even Swiss Francs can persuade me!"
sambucus. you can findit at a vitamin shop.
"I use the Nike Pegasus 35 Zooms and they're excellent and a good choice if you're on a tighter budget and can't quite stretch to the Turbos. I know the 35's have been superceded now though so 36's or 37's. 

I have used them for almost 100 runs this year and can't fault them, I normally alternate between 10km and half marathon runs. They feel fast and supportive and I got them for a great price."

"I was hoping you'd mention this, but I didn't see it -- there's no evidence that phenylephrine does anything more than a sugar pill, i.e., a placebo.

That's likely why you find that pseudoephedrine works better. It's because phenylephrine literally just doesn't do anything,"
"The TSA is going to break whatever lock you have anyway, then include a note about how they’re sorry they had to do it but they aren’t responsible."
"I'd say go for the IdeaPad 5 Pro 16"". Stronger CPU + better display."
Oral B makes an electric brush with a red light that lights up in your peripheral vision when it senses you are pressing too hard.  It trains you to ease up.  I would recommend that one for you.
