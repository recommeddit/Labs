"The FK2-B and the model o- are the purest fingertip mice that fit your grip and hand size. I would go for the model o- if you want something extremely light weight and small, while the fk2-b would fit you if you want something a bit larger but still small with a 82 gram weight.

Also the model o- is much cheaper and has better clicks, cables, and feet."
LMAO me too
Ok thanks for telling me .
"Highly recommend Last Chance U if youâ€™re into football. They hone in on the junior college scene where young college players scrap to make their way onto the Division 1 scene. Follows few players through the whole season, both in their games and their academic/social life. Great visual style too."
"Still old, but Pirates trilogy did adventure very well. The plotting may be an issue, but while watching all 3, I always felt I was on an epic adventure as well. Whether it was rescuing Elizabeth, or finding Davy Jones's chest, or bringing Jack Sparrow back from the locker, the series is pure adventure at its core. Hard to see why it does not get much love. Maybe because 4 and 5 are shit."

"Well I think some of the more common languages you'd probably want to learn are PHP and SQL. Those were the languages which we get taught at college so I guess they would be of use to you. 

&nbsp;

Apart from that maybe try out some frameworks/libraries for languages. I'd personally go for JQuery knowledge, after learning JavaScript. Don't just dive into JQuery at first even though it may seem to be so useful. Doing so may limit your knowledge of basic JavaScript which may in some cases be more worth it than including JQuery for everything. 

&nbsp;

There are a few additional frameworks/libraries you could try for JavaScript. I've been using Backbone.js, AngularJS, RequireJS, Underscore.js and a few others. Backbone.js and AngularJS are somewhat like Flask for Python, easy to setup a route (url to page) and handle it with specific templates and functions. You also have EmberJS which has a lot built in to start with and thus is pretty heavy compared to Backbone and AngularJS. I think EmberJS > AngularJS > Backbone in terms of built in possibilities. Depending on your needs you could choose one of them.

&nbsp;

For Python, I recently started working with Flask and made a REST API for some small private project. Flask looks very promising so far. One of the things I like most about Flask is how easy it is to setup a route, return a page made out of a template and data. Though you'll have to see for yourself as I'm pretty new to Flask. Python is a good language if you want to teach yourself to write clean and documented code, especially if you use PyLint.

&nbsp;

I've been working with PHP for some years now and it was okay. Not that great but it was the way to go for me. I just didn't like the messy code I made due to having PHP and HTML mixed together. In big projects it's just not a thing I'd like to work with, but for starting out I'd recommend giving it a try. I haven't worked with any PHP frameworks/libraries though I've read there are a few good ones out there. I think as for PHP I can't help you any further than this.

&nbsp;

Lastly SQL, I was taught to use MySQL databases. I guess it's pretty common to use so I'd start there if you're going to use databases on webpages which is very likely. Maybe if you're interested in more databases you could try out a few others, I've recently tried MongoDB and it seems to do pretty well. Keep in mind though that each database has it's own uses. If I remember correctly, MongoDB is useful with writing big data and storing it, but reading may be slower than MySQL. Also it has no relations like MySQL using the InnoDB engine may have.

&nbsp;

There is way more out there which I probably missed or haven't even heard of so be sure to do some research on frameworks/libraries yourself.

If you need more specific information like links to tutorials or anything else, tell me :)"

I noticed it's by the same director as Madoka Magica (although it's a completely different genre)."

"If I was doing a list...

* the list would be in no particular order (or perhaps in groups)
* no albums less than 10 years old
* certain bands, e.g. the Beatles and Dylan would either be excluded entirely or have their whole catalog treated as one entry.
* greatest hits and comps would be allowed.
* Perhaps separate some genres into side lists of their own, so you aren't comparing apples & oranges.

i dunno... just shooting from the hip here."

"You do not want a ""boosted immune system"" - your immune system attacks invaders, however with a heightned immune system response, your immune system turns on itself, viewing parts of your body as the invader. This is called an ""autoimmune disease."" Here is an example: One theory regarding Chron's disease is a heigned immune response of a type of cell (I forget now).

Thanks for your input. Unfortunately I barely passed algebra 2 so I doubt it is for me :(

You know Python, that's good, leverage that. Do not listen to comments telling you to learn a new language/framework, you don't have time for that. Also don't waste your time writing beautiful and neatly structured code, one include with database connect, common functions, login handling and header/footer will be enough. Copy paste a lot if necessary. Once your project is successful, you will have a ton of time to refactor everything it in the most elegant way possible. Don't be too sloppy though - always test the edge cases and don't forget about the security. Sanitize all your input AND output from the very beginning.

First, create a plan for your website. Determine a scope, think about what functions do you want it to have, create sketches of pages and a navigation map. If Lynda has courses about UX, complete the best of them. I myself really liked Joe Natoli's course on Udemy.

As for development itself, start by creating a database based registration and login system. Knowing in advance that your website will be multilingual, don't hard code any text, use includes or database for this purpose.

Once you have a prototype where you can register and log in, start adding a functionality, introduce account types with different access levels and create pages one by one. You should have a crude but fully functional prototype in 2-3 weeks. Use the rest of the time to style, debug, polish and optimize it. At the later stages of this, I would invite an unbiased QA, who will critique your work and provide a sanity check.

If you work hard and really concentrate, in 80 days you will have an awesome website that will provide all services that you intend to provide, will be intuitively easy to use and look great.

Good luck!"
