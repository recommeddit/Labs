29874,best money managing app,"Banktivity is solid, if you're a Mac / iPhone person.  I switched to it from YNAB, which focuses more on budgeting than tracking.  For your needs, YNAB sounds perfect though.  Go through their tutorials and forums where people have figured out the best way to set it up in terms of categories."
