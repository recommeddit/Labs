69986,best major to study in college,"Golf Management. 

EDIT: I'm serious it's a real thing. Some colleges offer profession golf management programs where you can get a job in some aspect of golf. Be a teacher/coach/professional/grounds keeper/official/ECT. There are several jobs for the golf industry. I've been playing golf since I was 5. I'm a senior in high school and I'm planning on going to college for the PGM program. From there I can get internships at some really nice golf courses and basically find what I want to do in the golf business. 

*there are a lot of comments I'm getting and I'm trying my best to get to all of them. Thank you all for the feed back/info I really appreciate it!*"

25433,best cricket teams of all time,Grace's average was actually exceptional for his era. Batting was incredibly tough in the 19th century.

54452,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Oh wow 4400 dpi?! What games do you play? That's insanely fast!

Xsoft does not depress unless you start pushing in a bit. Soft depresses with a little more force. They're both extremely comfortable. If you're a fingertip grip it won't matter, if your palm or claw you could go either way, but soft might be preferable if you have a heavy hand.

For me, I rest my arm on the pad from time to time and it would distract me when I sink in a bit, so soft worked better, but xsoft was totally doable."
57611,best cologne,"Creed Green Irish Tweed was an MFA favorite for several years, but at over $200 a bottle a bit out of my price range. Someone made an off-hand comment that Armaf Tres Nuit was an Irish Tweed knock-off available on Amazon for less than $30 so I decided to try that. I've gotten more compliments on my cologne in the past two years then in the previous 30 combined. Definitely a ""go to"" cologne for me."
2116,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"You go and ask them. They even advertised it once in their coupons. 

You can also watch them make the pizzas while you wait for yours. 

Their ranch sauce is made from hidden valley ranch dust too."
68193,best science fiction novel,"Yes the boxes were such a good way to show Virek's obsession while linking them to the rest of the overarching plot.

I also love how Count Zero portrays cyberspace and the culture surrounding it when compared to Neuromancer. It's a great expansion."
69281,best major to study in college,"For my current work I'm helping influence and formulate public policy for education systems in developing countries. My university had courses on public policy and international relations that taught how to write various policies. It likely wasn't geared towards what I'm doing now, but some experience works better than the none I'm dealing with now. I can't say having an extensive knowledge of French literature is helping me now. Though I am lucky to have done my capstone on their colonial influences."
26826,best board games,Depends on number of players. We did a 5 player game in about 3 hours with learning. It's not as long as I thought it would be.

23314,best car racing video game,"- Arcade racer: Trackmania, Forza Horizon 3

- Not recommended: GTA V. Has terrible driving physics and customization is expensive."
5419,best home improvement store,"Honestly, I've had crappy experiences with both of them, but they are necessary evils.  This is a little like having an argument over what is a better color, red or blue? 

I work in different areas and its actually quite surprising how different their stock is depending on location.  In more rural areas they will have a lot more tractor lawn mowers, propane etc.  While urban areas might have more fencing options, patio furniture etc.  Some of the stores vary a lot in sq footage so the amount of merchandise may vary greatly."
