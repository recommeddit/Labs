But the people here DO want to BIFL. They want something quality they never will have to worry about replacing.
The recent mario kart 64 world record video was truly well done. What a dramatic story!
"Awesome job on this - answered many questions I had about Nike's lineup.    

I've never run in the Flyknit shoes, I wonder if they allow stretch/splay like the stretch fabric that Newton/NB uses on some of their shoes, that LunarRacer looks really appealing for the cushion/weight ratio."

"Yes, exactly. I'd definitely need to quit my job.

Honestly, I'm sure I won't ever complete it in one go. There are just so many other things I would do if I quit my job.

Hopefully one I'll accomplish most if it in different steps. Not as gratifying, but it'd still be cool."

"That's what my dentist said.  It's more about gums and getting that area right where the teeth emerge. A hard bristle can irritate the gums causing them to swell a bit and prevent proper access.

I have really bad teeth and I also swear by a flosspik."
"I mean, I've talked to quite a few women who were involved and there was without a doubt a tonne of underground slash fiction trading. At that point there really weren't that many male Trekkies in comparison and not many, if any, were involved like they were. I'm also going to point out that dude, it was underground. They were hiding it. If you weren't on the mailing list you weren't going to find out about it because a lot of it wasnt legal to share around."
"Looks like Iâ€™ve got a reading list seeing as I loved anathem and blindsight.

Ever read embassytown? Good stuff."

"Despite the negative connotations of the word, the ""elitist"" anime tend to be my favorites.  I've seen several forum threads about elitist anime, like [this one](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1362444) and [this one](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1807052) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5otlxq/what_anime_do_you_generally_associate_with/).  But having a list is convenient."

Not as good as SLO but better than the other LA area counterparts. Plus they are extremely well funded by the Kellogg Foundation.
