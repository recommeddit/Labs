30093,best money managing app,"I've been using Clarity Money for a few months and love it.
Does anyone know how it compares to these others? Wondering if I'm missing something better."
61829,Best RPG game on PS4,"Thank you, but no :D I have done my research prior to playing Automata on Yoko Taro's work, reading up and watching a lot of info on Nier and Drakengards. (Whenever something is on hype and has a lot of backstory to it, I usually do my research and deep dive into it, whenever I am unable to play/experience it directly myself). I have platinummed Nier: Automata, doing all quests, and got all ""important"" endings, E included. However, I am not extatic and happy about the game, to me it did not live up to all the hype around it and frankly - I did not understand why it got hyped so much :("

47165,best state to visit in the United States,"New England is very pretty. Boston's a cool city, tons of great nightlife and shopping. From there, drive north along the coast. Portsmouth, NH, is a pretty town. Keep on going north. Portland, ME, is cool. Keep going north along the coast until you reach Acadia National Park. Absolutely gorgeous, especially in the fall when the leaves are changing (this basically goes for all of New England). 

*Edit. On the other side of the country, a lot of people have said SF, but I also recommend Oregon. Portland is a great city. To the west/southwest, the coast is beautiful. East is the Columbia Gorge and Mound Hood for outdoorsy stuff. Incredible places."
72145,best movies with a cool twist,Thanks for spoiling it.  I was going to go see that this weekend.

62707,Best Data Science textbook,"I like it a lot, but be aware that it's basically the opposite of Applied Predictive Modeling.  It's more for learning theory than for learning when you'd use a random forest to solve a classification problem."
69805,best major to study in college,How are people finding these high paying jobs?
6174,best Netflix documentary,Tiger King is an interesting subject but an absolutely terrible documentary series. By the end of it I hated the documentary makers.

19367,best YouTube video,When I watched the Regret in Heaven video and he talked about the middle school crush that always liked you but you never acted on it awakened an almost forgotten memory in me and sent me into a mini depression for the week. It was kind of pathetic
22782,best celebrity,"George Takei. He stopped a press conference I was observing to meet a little boy and sign his doll because he was sick and going home, and the meet n greet wasn't scheduled until later. The reporters looked a little put off, but George gave that little kid 100% of his attention for two minutes or so. I could see the kid's day was made."
2960,best webcamera,Give me a good microphone array over a good camera.
47777,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"The best calculator for any actual mathematics course is no calculator.  As with any rule, of course, there are exceptions, but I don't see a calculus course as one of them.

If your course requires it, then do what's required but avoid any other use.  Hopefully the course is well enough designed that the calculator actually helps.  However I believe this to be a rare occurrence.  The thing will become a crutch and a distraction.  It will allow you the illusion of knowledge while keeping you from it.  For example you don't learn to construct graphs and understand the behavior of functions by looking at graphs that have been constructed for you.  If you construct them then check out your result with the calculator, that can be very useful, but few students will discipline themselves to this sort of appropriate use.

Once you've mastered the material, it can be very rewarding to do further explorations with the technology."
