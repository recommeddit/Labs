"I used to play the shit out of [Char](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnqzIYZR1GA) a couple summers ago. I'll check out You Only Love Her Coz She's Dead, thanks!"
"HH Gregg still has the sales, but unless you're lucky and have one that they keep restocking, they're pretty bare."
"Return policy: ONLY if you have the card.  I've been screwed in the past by something I bought from them that I know for a fact Lowe's would have taken back.  It was beyond the 30 day period, but, as I said, Lowe's beats them hands down.  I appreciate your feedback and comment, thanks!"
"Of the bio majors I know, one is teaching ski classes, one went back to his old job as a paramedic, and one works at a coffee shop.  All the other ones went to medical school."
"It's such a  hippie/home remedy type situation but everyone at my office SWEARS by this. Oil of Oregano. It's SO disgusting but you can get caplets that are not so bad. I swear to god, it's a miracle."
If you took away Cook’s pre-contact yards he would be the 8th most productive RB of 2020. That’s just stupid.
"Try using something we've been developing at Stanford called Crio: r/https://crio.stanford.edu

We're planning to make it adapt to specific users soon.

If you'd be open to giving us some feedback we can work on customizing it."
"It’s a toss up between Rockstar Lime Freeze and Monster Cuba Lima (RIP to both). However, if we’re talking about something currently available, then definitely Venom Black Cherry Kiwi or the Coconut Edition Red Bull. Honorable mention would be Full Throttle Blue Agave"
Bethenny Frankel was the sweetest celeb I've met.
I love that you appreciate Iron Man 3. It's severely underrated.
"It's isopropanol, a different chemical to ethanol, the alcohol we usually drink, and iirc the only one we can metabolise. Drinking other alcohols may get you drunk, but will also cause blindness and likely, death."
Nice I’ll deff look into that
What position am I in?
"The 007

A James Bond Classic- Gordon’s Gin, Svedka Vodka and Lillet Blanc Liqueur, garnished with a Lemon"
"If you can ever get your hands on it, grab forza motorsport 4. One of the best in the series and just a great game in general"
"No, they are different enough. The big similarity is the concept of a machine that let's you enter someone's dream. Paprika is amazing, I highly recommend it."
Bvlgari Blue... Mmmm
That is my instinct to do so. Glad that is also the proper etiquette!
You better let that sweet lady win!
Facts. I’ma catch up.
"The only technology that’s really getting better is semiconductors, which explains the computers and amps. Outside of this though most things are stagnant or progress very slowly. Technology only gets better in very specific and niche ways, but not in the sense that every aspect of it improves, some things just kinda get stuck."
"u/Bojarow is pretty knowledgeable and objective in my view. Mostly sticks to interesting tidbits of info that others miss, and clarifying things. Strong member of the sub for sure. Do they have a bias against Tesla? Maybe, I'm not the final word on anything, but nothing imo worth getting upset about and certainly not in a toxic way.

If you read my history you'll probably think I'm some anti-Tesla type too. And maybe I am, who knows. I personally think Elon is a lunatic and there's a small but vocal minority of Tesla fans online that make it difficult to have normal discussions. I also think Tesla does some really cool stuff and I'm very glad they exist and are pushing EVs forward in their own way. I'll never forget the first time I drove one - I was grinning ear to ear for a week (and I used to ride motorcycles and had a BMW, so I'm vaguely familiar with speed). I just don't let that singular experience result in unquestioning loyalty.

I think we're all a lot more alike than different and we all want to see more BEV and less ICE. Cheers."
"There is nothing English about hash browns.

Don't dislike them, but they are no less American than buffalo wings."
