My favorite line in that entire film. Tobin Bell was the best actor in that movie and the best part was him simply getting up off the floor.
"Middle eastern royalty books an entire floor for a month.  Staff spends weeks preparing for every detail of the visit.  Entire floor rearranged to accommodate children, nannies, private dining quarters for men and women, etc.  Private chef is brought in.  They left after one week (on private 747) because it was too cold.  In Chicago.  In November."

"I grew up reading The Indian Express and was a loyal reader till I noticed a recent unabashedly pro-Congress tilt in everything they reported. Stopped reading it anymore.

Just yesterday someone here said TOI is too big and rich a media house to be pushed around by political parties. Honestly, I like their Mumbai coverage but I simply skip their Bollywood and cricket stories.

DNA is a good paper. Balanced coverage. Hyperlocal.

I abhor The Hindu for its Leftist stance and tendency to edit out news they feel should not be outed."

I've just bought the Asus TUF. For the same price I decided to stick with Asus as my old monitor that I was very pleased with an Asus and from the reviews I've read the differences are small enough to not matter to me personally. Not regretting at all right now.
I got a water flosser after I was diagnosed with periodontal disease. It works wonders. Apparently you aren’t supposed to bleed every time you brush your teeth! Who knew?!
"Okay, between this and other posts I'll buy that whitening doesn't work and that toothpastes stretch the magnitude of their effects as a selling point.

What about toothpaste for sensitive teeth?  My teeth are pretty sensitive, and whitening toothpaste actually gives me headaches after using it.
