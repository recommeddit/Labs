57285,"> You’re saying a lot of idiotic and inaccurate things, and have a terrible attitude about it, calm down.

Why does everyone on the internet assume that people are stark raving mad and yelling about things? Also, all of these things are based on scientific fact, and proven to be true, so... u wat m8?

> Mildly acidic water is not as bad as you’re making it out to be. Our stomach acid is way lower in pH, and our blood has plenty of buffers to neutralize any potential change in pH caused by that water.

Are you saying that stomach acid and human blood are safe to drink in the same quantities as water? Because they're absolutely not. They're not equivalents, and will not be treated as such.

> By your logic we should stop eating pretty much all fruits.

No, you're misinterpreting the data.

> Apples are between 3-5pH so we should stop eating those, huh?

Hot diggity dog, look at that misinterpretation.

> Blueberries should probably eradicated from the earth for their deadly pH of 3, right? Smh

Holy Jesus fucking titballs Christ! Why have we not eradicated blueberries yet! They're killing our population at an exponential rate and spelling absolute doom for mankind!

Oh wait. They're not.

Because these are the same exact arguments that corporations (look at me being a social justice warrior with all my buzzwords and silly haircuts) use in defense of bottled water. These are the same exact arguments that they use to convince people like you that all the crap they put into bottled water is okay.

> Sulfuric acid is in our stomachs

That doesn't mean that it's safe to consume.

> pH levels of apples are more acidic than water

Yeah, they're apples, not water.

> Blueberries have high acidity

Again, blueberries aren't water.

Your entire argument in favor for bottled water is being entirely based on things that are not bottled water.

Let's ignore that water part for just a second. How safe is that plastic? (it's not)",best water brand
