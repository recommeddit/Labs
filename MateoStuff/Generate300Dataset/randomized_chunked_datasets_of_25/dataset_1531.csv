66866,best soccer team in the world,"That's not how Transfermarkt works. It's the same value regardless of their contract duration.

Also doubt France has 2 players missing worth a combined €140M."

63390,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"This is true. If what was messing you up was a tweak and you just restore it using Installer or Batchomatic and the tweak was backed up, then itll just show itself again. However, hopefully you can maybe go into safemode with iCleaner and identify and disable the problem tweak :)"

56504,best desktop monitor,"I have a 75hz ultrawide. Here's an anecdotal opinion:

I play a lot of Siege. Sometimes when I run a Flash game, Siege will get messed up. This causes Siege to run at exactly 2 different speeds:57FPS, and 75FPS. I can tell you without question that I can tell exactly when my game is running at 57FPS. Absolutely infuriating. I've found I can make my game run at 75FPS by alt-tabbing out of Siege and then switching back in. I can also tell you that I've been killed a few times because I've been trying to get that sweet 75FPS back.

In my experience, the difference is extremely noticeable. My friends have noticed it was well."
