"I played paintball with Robin Williams and made it a point to run straight to his bunker and shoot him right in the face, he was going to be my prize. He was a good sport about it and spent the rest of the day giving me a running commentary/riff track on the game as it progressed. Really nice guy considering I just shot paint into his face."
Winner!!
"I bet half these names are forgotten in 50+ years while guys like Sammy Baugh, Broadway Joe, Mean Joe Green, etc will be remembered."
"Gotta be Owusu, most exciting person coming out of Australia rn"
"The trick in Canada is living next to the border.

Ogdensburg, NY is an hour drive away from me and I can get a packaged shipped to a holding place there for around $5. Still have to pay gas and duty but still better than the crazy high prices from Canadian retailers.

Unfortunately right now it's not that advantageous because of the abysmally low Canadian dollar. :("
"I don't know. While it has some good episodes (Hush specifically) much of Season 4 is tough to get through as the Big Bad is just awful in that season. We also had Riley as the Angel replacement and it doesn't work, i'm not sure if Whedon and co dropped the ball with the Character or its just that Blucas isnt a great actor and lacks any charisma but something is off . Oh and we have the episode 'Beer Bad' which has to be one of the worst episodes ever (and ""Where the Wild Things Are"" isnt much better)

We perhaps have 'Angel' to blame as perhaps that provided a distraction initially"
"Its the one show that i literally could not give a rating on MAL because i was just…. in shock……


I literally could not function for a good hour or so after i finished it, it was just too much."
Wifi is always my top concern when going to a beach resort
"I don't think there's a lot of reason to over think, but be real: there's differences for a reason. The way blue switches work vs Brown/red/black is very different and again, not very conducive to some (popular) styles of gaming. When you're spending upwards of a hundred and fifty on a keyboard (minimum) you ought to get the right information to help decide which you'll prefer. I think for a person just now ""going mechanical"" with games in mind that blues are a bad choice."
that's the upcoming iPhone 12
"It's sad, because I totally knew it was intended to be a parody and that nothing in the trailer is supposed to make sense besides being cliches, but it still made me want to see it."
"I have found great deals at the Habitat for Humanity stores. The only problem with them is they do not carry a standard stock of material. It is basically whatever has been donated to them. I just go there often and see what new items have come in.

 One time i bought a pair of solid wood closet doors with full size attached mirrors on them for 13 dollars a piece."
Isn’t that people said about the 8-gen cpus?
"I have the C270. If you override the exposure to -5 or -6 in OBS's camera settings and set your own brightness, whitdbalance, and other settings with good lighting, it actually looks like a really good webcam. You'll only really notice the quality reduction if you're streaming higher than 720p and you go for a full cam view scene."
Kinda homosexual don’t you think
"Bullshit. Tesla built a concept vehicle. It’s not street legal and to bitch about the hummer not being “functional” is nothing more than fanboy whining. Gm has a very long history of building and delivering a product. Tesla has a short history with a lot of delays. 

It’s also bullshit to say gm is far behind. They’ve delivered on bolt and have a very feasable vehicle in the hummer. The numbers theyve given for range are believable, the vehicle design is believable, and the price is expected. Gm has a much bigger supply chain than tesla does. 

You dont have to shill for tesla. Im no fan of gm vehicles but its not exacly controversial to say they they have a much longer history and a much bigger budget to make this happen on time than tesla."
That was exactly my thought as well. So glad that he was a genuine person. Logalogalogalogaloga!

"oh man, I really have to disagree.  You must have stayed at a really shitty place, but the high tier Marriott properties are BETTER than just about anything else.

Firstly, Costa Rica.  Come on.  You aren't getting their best hotel in Costa Rica. Try the category nine hotels in europe like the Grosvenor House in london, or the Champs-Elysees Marriott in paris.  Those are 600-700 bucks a night hotels and they're amazing.  And if you REALLY hate the marriott brand, you can use marriott points to stay at Ritz-Carlton hotels worldwide, which are also typically stunning.

Marriott has some extremely good high end properties."

You're probably right.
Thank you for taking the time to do this for everyone!
"yes, quebec girls really are gorgeous!"
Woodstock's every Monday is Bogo for large and XL. Best deal on town.
Lowe's has fucked me over on a few occasions with very simple customer service scenarios. Home Depot always treats me well. I avoid Lowe's at all costs
