18944,best YouTube video,"When he completely infiltrated that scam call center, my mind was blown. Kitboga is the the Yin to his Yang. Absolutely hilarious but not as invasive."
59255,best perfume,my favorite!!!! also many of my friends'
13245,best gifts for mom,SAHD here. A nice pair of headphones were the best present I received. Our baby monitor lights up so I just keep it in my field of view and fire up the TV or computer to relax during nap time. Works great even with baby sleeping on me.

67082,best places to skydive in california,I'd go to Perris and jump out of a skyvan if you can.
73555,best battery bank,"Is fast charging important in a camping scenario? Slow charging is more efficient so would mean a lighter powerbank for the same benefit, so long as you don't mind leaving it plugged in a bit longer. Not really an issue for me when hiking. Charging the powerbank itself might be better faster, if you're stopping off places, however."
43980,best items under $100,"Download it... And 3d print that shit. 

Not literally shit."
53547,best medicine for a cold,"I'm one of the odd birds for whom Zyrtec is basically general anesthesia, lol. I made the mistake of taking one before hosting a party and ended up sleeping through the entire thing. For some reason I can tolerate Benadryl with only mild sedation, but Zyrtec is a no-go if I'd like to remain upright"
61253,Best RPG game on PS4,"Persona 5.  

But also FFXII. It's kind of an odd RPG, as the combat is usually more about having everything set up right and just letting it play out. But it's fun."

49401,best gaming monitor,I am going for LG27GL850. Dell uses LG panels so I would say that's a good choice also.
3235,best webcamera,"Another big up for the kiyo. I have a larger ring light that I use now instead of the built in one, but the camera itself is great quality. I was hesitant at first but I'm glad I gave it a shot. (Plus, yeah the logi was out of stock when I first started steaming). Also, if you're into aesthetics, I personally thing it looks pretty rad."
65435,best phone service company,"How many are willing to prepare a year though? It doesn't seem like many are willing to drop $200 or $300 at once for a year of service.

Teltik seems to be mentioned a bit, but if you know TMobile network works for you, save some money and get more data through a 1yr plan. Seems like if it were the case Red pocket would be even more popular with the crazy deals they have."
70866,best movies with a cool twist,"Arrival, Predestination, Memento. I think Memento is the best one out of the three for a nice fucking of the mind."
