34179,best NFL player,Barry Sanders. He did rely on other players to get shit me like Jerry Rice Joe Montana etc.
46797,best hand santizer brand,Viruses break down over time.  A few days going through the water cycle is enough to drastically reduce the odds of infection.
35756,best alcoholic drink,Yup. Some solid advice that I stupidly ignored to my own demise. I'd also add that if your friends buy you a shot you make damn sure they are buying 2 and drinking one themselves. If they won't drink a cement mixer right after a double shot of rail vodka it might be a sign you shouldn't either.

44108,best items under $100,"~~You don't wash them with soap and water as that gets rid of the seasoning from the food you just cooked.~~
Turns out you can use some soap, just don't go in hard with the scrubbing.

Most of the time, you can just rinse under hot water and wipe (or ever so lightly scrub) to get rid of the burnt bits and other food particles.

You can also use salt and a light brush to get rid of the more stubborn bits."
15534,best tree for the garden,"Sorry I can't help you there. Never looked into pine nut trees. The big problem with anything of that scale is going to be how do you harvest, process and sell it in a profitable manner. 30 acres of pine nuts is going to be a massive job and if you pull that off you still have to know where to sell that many pine nuts at the optimal price.   Same goes for anything else you grow. Apples, Peach, etc. 


With pine wood its all contracted out to your lumber buyer. They usually bring in their own equipment.. tractors, cutters, trucks. They harvest and process and send you a check."

I know the mids don't grip as good, but a soft not gripping is strange..."
