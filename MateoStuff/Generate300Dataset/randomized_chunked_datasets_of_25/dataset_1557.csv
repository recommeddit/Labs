69747,Criminal Justice. I'm about 2 months way from having my AA in CJ but every law enforcement professional I met said don't waste your time getting your bachelors in CJ. Get it in something practical like business or engineering so if goodness forbid something happens to you then you have a degree in something else to fall back on. I want to be a police officer btw.,best major to study in college

It has decent integrated graphics, so it should be solid for general use and light games. Otherwise, the Gateway 15.6"" with the Ryzen 5 3450U processor is also viable.",best laptop for general use

27580,"I love these posts! Thanks to the OP

SRK: Charming and affable. However, he is surely very intense and hard working as well. His work ethic is good and I find him to be a sensible and humble guy. He has also demonstrated intelligence in the way in which he has crafted his career.

Salman: What to say about Bhai? Gosh. Honestly I've was a fan before I got older and found out more about him. He is definitely incredibly arrogant and insecure. He seems to be unable to handle criticism and hence surrounds himself with 'yes' people. It is obvious people also use him and exploit him for his influence. Seems to also have a bad temper and aggressive streak.

Aamir: Can't stand him. Arrogant and pretentious. Seems to think he is the only person capable of acting in the whole of Bollywood. Fake as well.

Akshay: His work ethic and martial arts discipline can't be faulted but he does seem to be quite condescending to other people. His supposed philandering ways are also quite sad seeing that he is married. He seems easy to work with and charitable when needed though. Very smart with PR and the roles he takes.

Ranbir: Seems to be introverted guy and a bit of a ladies man. In general - he seems chilled and wants to be seen more as an artist than a typical star.

Ranveer: He is actually an underrated actor but his childish antics detract from the good work he does. He seems to be a bit eccentric but it comes across as try hard and extra. Truly loves his wife though.

Varun: He seems to just be a simple 'dude' or 'jock' kind of guy. I don't see him as very intelligent but he comes across as a fun and easy going guy. Seems to be more interested in commercial roles than 'real acting'.

Kartik: Maybe he is slightly overwhelmed by his success and make silly errors which people pick on. Overall, seems like a genuine but goofy guy.

Ayushmann: He really comes across as intelligent and a well rounded guy who has thought out his roles well.",best bollywood actor
