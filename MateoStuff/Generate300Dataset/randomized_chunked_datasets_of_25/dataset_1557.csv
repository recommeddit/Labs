30475,best Mexican war to study,"**Question:** as a non-American I've always found the Civil War inpenetrable.  
Can anyone suggest any documentaries or podcast series that will give me a good introduction?"
35691,best alcoholic drink,"I like Campari and I like bourbon, so I love making myself boulevardiers. I rarely order them when I go out, though, because I cringe at how pretentious it sounds to say ""boulevardier"" out loud."
69747,best major to study in college,Criminal Justice. I'm about 2 months way from having my AA in CJ but every law enforcement professional I met said don't waste your time getting your bachelors in CJ. Get it in something practical like business or engineering so if goodness forbid something happens to you then you have a degree in something else to fall back on. I want to be a police officer btw.
10827,best suitcase lock,Doesn't that just take up more time and kind of an extreme just to ensure the safety of your baggage?
70153,best major to study in college,I'm a gay atheist philosophical anthropologist that minored in fine arts and you're all just jealous.
18400,best YouTube video,Fyi he has two albums of songs and was one of the lead actors in the fx show the league. Both are very funny
73539,best battery bank,"The commingled inventory you speak of, from what I've researched on, only applies to third-party sellers who opt into ""Fulfillment by Amazon"". Amazon wouldn't dare taint their own inventory, they have a separate facility for those sellers. Can you imagine the lawsuits

By the way, you can click view other sellers and specifically choose Amazon to buy from directly"

They are just really into cameras."

7427,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I'd say go for the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14"" with the Ryzen 5 5500U on my list if you can go a bit over budget. It has decent integrated graphics, so it should be solid for general use and light games. Otherwise, the Gateway 15.6"" with the Ryzen 5 3450U processor is also viable."
25308,best spiderman actor,Holland. Just on look and how he plays the character feels like peter Parker
2264,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I wouldn’t say cheap, but it’s amazing."
27580,best bollywood actor,"I love these posts! Thanks to the OP

SRK: Charming and affable. However, he is surely very intense and hard working as well. His work ethic is good and I find him to be a sensible and humble guy. He has also demonstrated intelligence in the way in which he has crafted his career.

Salman: What to say about Bhai? Gosh. Honestly I've was a fan before I got older and found out more about him. He is definitely incredibly arrogant and insecure. He seems to be unable to handle criticism and hence surrounds himself with 'yes' people. It is obvious people also use him and exploit him for his influence. Seems to also have a bad temper and aggressive streak.

Aamir: Can't stand him. Arrogant and pretentious. Seems to think he is the only person capable of acting in the whole of Bollywood. Fake as well.

Akshay: His work ethic and martial arts discipline can't be faulted but he does seem to be quite condescending to other people. His supposed philandering ways are also quite sad seeing that he is married. He seems easy to work with and charitable when needed though. Very smart with PR and the roles he takes.

Ranbir: Seems to be introverted guy and a bit of a ladies man. In general - he seems chilled and wants to be seen more as an artist than a typical star.

Ranveer: He is actually an underrated actor but his childish antics detract from the good work he does. He seems to be a bit eccentric but it comes across as try hard and extra. Truly loves his wife though.

Varun: He seems to just be a simple 'dude' or 'jock' kind of guy. I don't see him as very intelligent but he comes across as a fun and easy going guy. Seems to be more interested in commercial roles than 'real acting'.

Kartik: Maybe he is slightly overwhelmed by his success and make silly errors which people pick on. Overall, seems like a genuine but goofy guy.

Ayushmann: He really comes across as intelligent and a well rounded guy who has thought out his roles well."
