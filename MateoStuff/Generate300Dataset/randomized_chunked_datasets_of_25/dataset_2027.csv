27883,best breakfast foods,The secret to any good oatmeal is putting a crapton of brown sugar in it.
66582,best soccer team in the world,"The United team of the late 90s/early 00s was excellent, but they only got to 1 European Cup final. How are they better than the Inter Milan team of the 60s, who got to 3, and won 2? Or the Benfica team of the same era, who won 2, and got to 5 finals?

They were a brilliant team, but they don't deserve to be so high up this list."
6198,best Netflix documentary,The Pharmacist was really good.
44683,best items under $100,I like Orabrush.
57674,best cologne,"People recommending one scent or another aren't really answering your question. You need to pick a scent that matches your personal body chemistry. 

How do you do that? Take a shower using unscented soap the night before. The next day, don't do anything to get yourself dirty or sweaty, then go in to a department store and ask for help in the perfume section. They will let you test some scents on paper slips. Narrow it down to 3-4 scents, then pick one and spray some on a clean body part such as the crook of your elbow or whatever - NOT YOUR WRIST or anywhere near your hands because they will get dirty through your day even if you try to avoid it. Walk around the store for a half an hour to let the scent ""mature"" and then sniff that spot. 

If you like it, go for it. If not, spray something else that you liked somewhere else, walk around for 30 minutes, and see how it goes. You need to let the scent sit on your skin for a while before you know if it's ""for you"" or not. Someone else's recommendation might not work for you so don't just go buy the most popular thing in this thread. Cologne is very personal and there's no ""wrong"" or ""right"" choice."
9312,best toothpaste,Maybe salt water is a good mouthwash too.
16656,best pet for toddlers,She sits on the windowsill but I'll look into getting something like that. Thank you.
48221,best color to paint with,"Depends on the rooms.  I bought a two home with not much are per room and things were tight, fucking pain in the ass covering things and painting.  Next house had large rooms where we could shove everything into the center of the room, cover, paint, no big deal."
29955,best money managing app,I need something that holds my hand like ynba but it doesn't work with my bank!
7415,best laptop for general use,">good balance between performance and battery life

I'm guess that's why you've recommended it over the HP Envy? And then how does it compare to the Lenovo Legion 5 15?

Also, is there a big chance that the Acer Swift X will get any cheaper/go on sale (i.e.: Black Friday)?

Thanks again for your expertise."
13052,best gifts for mom,"This is my preferred gift.  I took my dad to go see the Trinidad vs. De LaHoya fight at Madison Square Garden because he's a boxing fan and I know he would never buy tickets for himself to go. 

I've bought Broadway tickets for mom in the past.  This year I bought tickets for the family to go see Wait, Wait, Don't tell me in Austin for her birthday because she's the one that turned my wife and I onto NPR. 

The hard part with these gifts is making sure the person you're gifting is free during the event."
56788,best desktop monitor,Thank you for including monitors with freesync!!
73682,best battery bank,"Unfortunately it appears the Zendure A3PD tips the scales at 222 grams, yikes. At that weight it should also filter water, self arrest, and mix margaritas.~~~"
59923,best perfume,"Pacifica in general is great for cheapie scents. Dream Moon is lovely, but I'll never get over my beloved Tibetan Mountain Temple."
61329,Best RPG game on PS4,"FF XII is so good, oh boy, my fav FF alongside IX.  


Are there psx games on ps4? if so you could try Vagrant Story, that game is HARD and a little difficult to get into but it's awesome."
17910,best Kardashian,"At first I hated Khloe, I thought she was needlessly aggressive to Scott before they became close. Once she calmed down she was one of my favorites, I thought she was funny and down to earth. But now I can't stand her again, half the time she's preaching ""peace love and harmony"" and the other half she's bragging about ""rich bitch energy"", attacking Jordyn for only her part in the Tristan saga, emotionally abusing Kourtney, simping after Kim, etc. 

I liked Kim aside from the times she would act bratty, but the past 2-3 seasons have completely turned me off to her, I think she's become very toxic. 

I know people say Kendall is entitled and they've had rude experiences with her, which I'm sure are true. But as far as what I've seen of her on the show, I do like that her energy is pretty chill. 

Someone already mentioned this, but one thing I appreciate about Kylie is her keeping her private life pretty low key. Setting aside her using Stormi as a promotional prop, I still like that she isn't as extra as Kim. 

I've never liked Kris lol, textbook narcissist if you ask me.

I think Kourtney's the funniest sister (before her sisters drove her to depression). I like that she doesn't necessarily want fame, she just wants a comfortable life. I also appreciate that she's one of the only family members who sees the value in therapy, I can't stand how Kim and Khloe constantly dismiss mental health. I hope Kourtney is able to carve out a healthy life for herself. 

So to answer the OP's question, I'm going to cheat and say my favorite KarJenner has and always will be SCOTT! #longlivelorddisick"
69392,best major to study in college,"I'm going into CS. [I really think it's a cool major and field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nKIu9yen5nc).

I've been told that a lot of side-projects will get you a job or at least your foot in the door for an interview, so I should be working a lot on these kind of things when I'm in college."
53110,best hiphop album,nigga asked for good debuts but clearly wanted shit from dudes that are already making music he listens to lmao
32832,best free online grammar checker,"Grammerly free version is fine on its own. The paid one doesn’t make much of a difference, and you still have to proof read it’s suggestions. 

I like to use the free grammarly version, and then use the “read out loud” function on Word to listen to what I wrote to see if anything sounds strange or repetitive."
42240,movies like Inception,It's amazing how much they do with so little in this film. Captivating from start to finish.
