34907,"After watching film he really wasn’t that much better this year in my opinion. Yell at me all you want, but *so much* of his volume stats especially came in garbage time against super soft defenses.

Yes, his team was bad. No, wins are not a QB stay. But yes, he did benefit a ton from playing from way behind for the second half of a lot of games. If you’d like the least appropriate comparison ever, he got the Blake Bortles BOAT Bonus. That’s not to say he isn’t super talented, but I do think other QBs did more with their own massively flawed teams.",best NFL player
31861,"I would agree with this order.  I enjoyed the Royal Pacific. It was a nice hotel, included express pass, and was cheaper. Portofino Bay is amazing, but obviously more expensive. It depends on your budget. If you want to spend the money then hands down Portofino Bay is the best. I prefer the theming of Royal Pacific over Hard rock.",best hotel to live in

also for afghanistan I lean more toward it was justified.  It just seemed like it happened so quickly like the government just reacted instantly to Afghanistans refusal to turn over osama without trying something else first.",best Mexican war to study

It's not always the major which causes the unemployment, low salary, etc. The type of person who chooses one of the ""bad"" majors may just be the type of person who is not necessarily career-driven in general, leading to those outcomes. The major is not entirely to blame.",best major to study in college

72866,"I've said it before, but I believe that Ubuntu is not the king of noob-friendly distros anymore. It feels like it's transitioned into the most versatile distro in terms of being fit to do almost anything, and having guides for all those things. In comparison, Linux Lite/Linux Mint are much more focused on the new user experience, so Ubuntu isn't really in the same category as them.

Antergos and Manjaro are in Comfortable because they are up and ready quickly and provide a great fresh install experience.

As for the flavors of Ubuntu, I would put them all in the same category (Comfortable), but I definitely think some are easier to use than others. For example, the non-Gnome3 flavors of Ubuntu are friendlier than Gnome just because of the pre-existing knowledge someone coming from windows would have.",best Linux distro

68500,"See that's what makes lists bad to some extent. Sometimes a ranking has more to do with the qualities of other elements than itself. 

Personally I'd like a format similar to what r/skyrimmods does for mods. They basically have a mod ask for mods of some type or function, and then they list all these threads. You end up with list of mods of some type, genre, function with some feedback or commentary in the threads about differences or key points, but they arent really ranked",best science fiction novel
8980,"""Toothpastes help, but the action of the bristles is much more significant.""

Maybe this is stretching too far beyond this thread's topic but...from this I gather that the toothbrush might be a better place to focus our Teeth Money. Is there something specific to look for when grabbing a brush, rather then looking at the toothpaste ingredients?

Personally, I find myself in the morning not using paste but just water as it makes my teeth ""feel"" more clean, but that surely is just personal preference.",best toothpaste
