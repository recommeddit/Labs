67629,"You’re not entitled to their time. Being considerate is acknowledging that they might not be able to fix anything and you have to look for alternatives. They don’t have to be considerate to the community as much as Picasso needs to be considerate to art critics. You don’t like it, move on.

Edit: In other less polite words. Stop being an entitled whiny prick. They did something for free, now they don’t want to do it for free anymore. Grow up and accept some personal responsibilities, not everyone is here to fix all your problems for you. If you can’t accept that. Well, too bad. Maybe consider another career.",axios alternatives reddit

7710,"Planning on finally replacing my laptop once the stimulus check comes in, though I'm thinking I want to keep to $400 and below for my budget.

I don't do the fanciest stuff, but I'd like something that can handle running a few things at once without crapping itself. I'll usually have some music or Youtube running while I do work or art stuff, so being able to do that without something stuttering would be nice. I don't do much gaming on PC, but if there's something that can run stuff decently without breaking the bank, that's a nice bonus (but not crucial).

My current laptop is an Asus with 4GB of RAM and 465 GB of storage, so anything that beats that out is a huge plus.",best laptop for general use

17856,"Of the Jenner sisters, Kendall is my favorite. She seems the most grounded of the Kardashian-Jenner clan in general. Least favorite is Kylie. She just doesn't seem to have much personality, and I don't like her constant need for shots. Of the Kardashian sisters, I've gone back and forth a lot over the years, but my current favorite is Kim for how hardworking she is, and my current least favorite might be Khloe. She just seems like she's given up on her love life, and is letting Tristan call the shots because her self-esteem is so low after the cheating scandals. I feel bad for her. But, I also don't like her attitude over the past few years regarding how much or how little Kourtney shares about her life. Kourtney's personal life kept the show afloat for years; she's earned her privacy, and I'm sure her kids are approaching an age where they're thankful for it.",best Kardashian
