My family gives out marshmallows where would that go under?
I'd still go with a g sync monitor. Though you pay a premium because it's licensed.
"Mission Workshop. Pricey but if you can find one used they are sick, I got a Rambler (MSRP $295) for $80 and it's fantastic, though that model is not as good for campus use (I usually use an old burton skate pack but it has a broken zipper [best way to get zippers fixed?], so the rambler works but isn't ideal) they have smaller packs as well."
"I'm sorry, they're not for sale."

Wrap the burrito in a paper towel and microwave it for 1 minute on each side!
Is there still a premium to get a G-SYNC monitor as opposed to Freesync? When I got my last computer 5 years ago G-SYNC monitors were $100 more than Freesync monitors and were one of the huge pushes for getting AMD... but I don't know if they eased up on that.
"Just like Terminus Est, the series is a double edged sword.  While I think it's the best sci-fi I've read, it also ruined other books for me.  The complex, layered story that doesn't outright tell you everything is so far from other author's works that they seem simple and less interesting.

It took a while after finishing that series before I could pick up other sci-fi books and truly enjoy them.  I just had to accept that they're a straight line, skin deep story before I could enjoy that story and those ideas.

If the narrator (Severian) says he has a perfect memory, but misremembers something, it's only up to the reader to figure that out.  The book doesn't outright beat you over the head with it.  And then you have to wonder what else might be false.

Other books will just tell you a character is lying or wrong before the sentence is even complete, because heaven forbid the reader not immediately know that."
Recommend to play both or should I just jump on the 2?
"Born and raised in LA and Disneyland is the best. I’m not a Disney fanatic (in fact, I’m more a movie person so I thought Universal would be more my jam) but Disneyland is pristine. It’s expensive but if you’re gonna make a day out of it, just go to the top"
"I consider that 2001 Test match in Kolkata the greatest Test match I have ever seen India play. The greatest Test fight back, under the cosh from toughest bowlers, and as the research suggests, the most dominant team at the time."
"What chemists/physicists/biologists are you talking about? If your p-value is 0 you must have a discontinuous power function. If it's really an exclusive set of hypotheses then you must have a power of 1 for the rejection region. I.e. a single observation completely refutes or supports any claim like this...

So... Anatomical papers concerned with an individual's bone structure? Chemists isolating rare and dangerous substances and making only obvious claims for narrative purposes?

Even in those papers I could imagine someone being interested in getting a second opinion thus reflecting a desire to improve n, even if it's difficult or weird in practice.

But yeah, dearsomething is totally right here."
"For long term use, the two main important points are software updates and repairabiloty.

iPhones are impossible to repair. I would suggest you to get a fair phone.

I do not use one as they are not available where I live.

How is priority and roaming Vs postpaid and Vs Boom Mobile?
"Bacon and Egg roll: Two Eggs Sunny Side up, Two slices of thick cut bacon, Soft Bread Roll, Nice spicy relish.

Serve with Banana Thickshake.

Then go back to bed."
"Olio on Victoria st across from the public market. Make sure to go to the pizzeria and not Olio Limone the fancy restaurant in the front.
Lucky Penny pizza in the funk zone
Via Vai in montecito 
Petrini’s and Giovanni’s in San Rocque
And you can’t go wrong with 805-564-1111, order extra ranch."
"Fiji, Evian or smartwater. Voss just tastes like bathroom tapwater to me."
This is my exact ranking!! All are good though

"I think the Non-QD version might be the one to go for, the wider gamut on the QD is just absolutely overkill for almost anyone and from what i've seen, the Non-QD version has better yields QC-wise"

"Iron Rattler is overrated. There’s not as much airtime, and the final drop isn’t that good. I found there to be more airtime on the first drop than that. For me it’s the worst of the three RMCs I’ve done (it’s my #6 overall so I don’t hate it). The other 2 I’ve done are twisted cyclone and Wonder Woman."
"Wonderful, I'm so happy!"
