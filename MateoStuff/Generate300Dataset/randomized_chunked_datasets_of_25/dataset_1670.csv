56101,best action and adventure movie,"I'm surprised nobody said it yet, but the good the bad and the ugly is the best one ever for me."
6984,best iPhone,What do you mean? Is it like that weird irritation some people get with black lights?
17282,best iOS game,"Isn’t Grid supposed to be pretty excellent? I’ve only played on console, but heard good things about the ports"
25299,best spiderman actor,"Tobey’s my favorite Spidey for the fact that raimi got his motivation right, this one being “great power, great responsibility”. Garfield’s motivation was revenge and Tom’s spidey wants to prove himself to the Avengers, he does show some of responsibility in Homecoming and I really liked that line in Civil War “when you can do the things that I can...”.  but I feel they need to show more of that and less of “ look at me, Mr. Stark!”.

Don’t get me wrong,  every Spider-man movie version has been great in their own right, but I feel that the original trilogy just resonates more with me."
58289,best cologne,Can confirm my Grandad wore Old Spice.
71241,best movies with a cool twist,"I still don’t know how this is possible, but maybe two months ago I come to find out that not only had my wife never seen The Sixth Sense, but that she hadn’t had it spoiled. I carefully asked what she knew about the film and she said nothing so we watched it together that night. 

It was SO FUN to watch it with someone who didn’t know the twist, because when the big reveal happens she lost her shit, it was amazing."
13139,best gifts for mom,A pack of condoms - may she learn from her mistakes.
16028,best sunglasses for fashion,"I'm sort of a sunglasses enthusiast. I have really bad eyes and grew up poor, so I had to wear glasses every day and we could never afford prescription sunglasses. 

Now I'll buy myself a new pair of sunglasses every year or so. More often if they're cheap, but at least one nice pair every year or two. 

I have: 
* [Quay Paradiso](https://www.shopbop.com/paradiso-sunglasses-quay/vp/v=1/1505288109.htm?fm=search-viewall&os=false) - my newest, wonderfully oversized 

* Ray-Bans in [New Wayfarer](http://www.ray-ban.com/usa/sunglasses/RB2132%20UNISEX%20047-new%20wayfarer%20classic-black/805289048527) (my first real sunglass purchase back in 2007 when these were everywhere), [Caravan](http://www.ray-ban.com/usa/sunglasses/RB3136%20UNISEX%20011-caravan-gold/8053672494556?category_Id=333139) (great aviator shape for rounder faces/full cheeks) and [Caravan with Violet Mirrored Lenses](http://www.ray-ban.com/usa/sunglasses/RB3136%20UNISEX%20007-caravan-bronze-copper/8053672341690?category_Id=332668)

* A blonde tortoiseshell cat-eye from See (non-prescription) and a brownish tortoise shell classic square from See (prescription) 

* Several pairs of cheapies from Loft, Old Navy, Target or The Limited (RIP) that I'll buy for trends, like smaller round-eye ones (for that 1920's/[Judge Doom in Toon Town look](http://aintitbalenews.com/aibn-content/uploads/2012/03/586911-wfrr5.jpg). 

I store them all on a little picture rack behind my bedroom door, the kind that comes with miniature clothespins for holding tiny photos on string. It's perfect and also I don't feel so guilty when they're all strung up."
68037,best science fiction novel,"Their books are *really* hard to find.  Melville House has republished *Definitely Maybe* but it's already out of print and used copies are going for $100+.  They've also republished The Dead Mountaineers Inn which was very good.  And within the next few months SF Masterworks is going to be republishing Hard to be a God and Monday Starts on a Saturday.  Even then, though, there's still a ton of books from them that haven't even been translated into English yet."
42774,best detective show,It's not detective but a crime/mob TV show.
36767,best alcoholic drink,"The first drink I purchased after turning 21 was a Long Island iced tea. Basically straight booze so if you’re not ready to take on something so alcohol-forward it might not be a good option but if you’re looking to make your first (legal) drink count, it might be a good option. Haha"
70226,best major to study in college,They literally kill people
18367,best YouTube video,"""Where tha FUCK did you get raw, unprocessed cotton?"""

65095,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,My favorite is Buddha Bowls hands down!!!!! I go whenever I have the chance:)))
18026,best Kardashian,"Kim-She is aware of herself, she understands her influence she has on people and uses it to her advantage. She’s a very smart business women. She has been able to keep herself relevant over the past decade. That’s a hard thing to accomplish. She is very dramatic and bratty. While sometimes she can be her siblings biggest supporter and cheerleader she can also be very critical and hurtful. 

Kourtney- She seems like a fun mom. She is all about her kids when it comes to fun and memories  and experiences. I also love her style. She is very judge mental and super outspoken to the point that I’d almost say she says things that in my opinion would be unforgivable. I also hate that if she doesn’t agree with someone she automatically puts them down and calls them annoying. 


Khloe- She loves life and Loves her family even more. I feel like family is her #1 priority. She always try’s to see the positive side of things in life and she is a hopeless romantic (while this can also be a negative character trait of hers). I fee like she would be the only one to be okay if she “lost it all” I think she is the most in touch with reality with “common folk” lol ( I’m sure you can tell she’s my favorite). She is an enabler to Rob. She is very easy to forgive people. She will do anything for the man she’s with even it comes to turning her back on her moral code. I think she has a lot of issues when it comes to the way she handles  her relationships with men. 

Kendall- Gorgeous and I appreciate how she keeps her private life pretty private compared to all the other sisters. She is so unaware of everything. She has been so privileged in her life that she lacks any awareness of what’s going on in the real world. I don’t think she really understands how some of her actions and decisions could offended people. I feel like out of all the apologies the Kardashian/ Jenner’s make hers are always the least sincere. 

Kylie- obviously gorgeous and seems super into her little family. She seems very confident and happy I’m her relationship and private life. She is so aware that she can get younger people to buy literally anything she shills, She uses that to her advantage. I also despise how she always is on her soap box about not wanting to be famous. I feel like out of all her sisters besides Kim she LOVES being famous and relevant the most. 


One thing I hate about the 3 older sisters and Kris that they have in common is I believe they are a big part of the reason Rob is the way he is. While I do believe obviously Robs actions both mentally and physically are his fault and he did a lot of this to himself and I believe he needs to seek mental health treatment I don’t think the sisters helped his well being in the slightest. From Khloe/ kris enabling him for so long. To Kim/Kourtney  constantly calling him a loser/ annoying and telling him he will never amount to anything for so long. To always emasculating him making him feel less than. I’m not shocked he’s gone down hill over the years."

55781,best action and adventure movie,"It's a romcom, with elements of action and adventure. It's not a proper adventure flick like the Indiana Jones series, and not even half as good as those flicks."
