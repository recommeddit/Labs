"I've had that video in my ""watch later"" list for a while now because it was a related video to something I watched and I thought, ""Cool, I could do with a nice, brief history lesson on Japan"".

I finally just watched it and had no idea that's what I was in for."

Great post duDe. I'm removing a bad habit and implementing a good one so far. I'm trying to do nofap and implenting studying every single day for at least 1 hour.

It’s excellent! Only caveat is that it’s one of the most graphically violent shows on TV
During covid when we were all work from home I set up my DSLR as my webcam for meetings and I got told to stop camera shaming people and go back to the shitty webcam in my laptop

I don't think NVDA is a bad bet. I'm just more bullish on AMD. ARM combined with INTC losing their status quo are both more favorable to AMD on a 10+ year scale.

Follow up question: how is the tap water in the us? Is it drinkable? Here in Finland the tap water actually tastes really good, so I've never really bought bottled water, is it different over there?"

Here in Ga, I generally see peaches, pecans, and pines. Farther north there's apples, pears and Christmas trees.for super long term investment, start a huge botanical gardens and create a legacy from it, or you could plant black walnuts for the timber value, or under-marketed fruits like paw-paw, pomegranate, or quince.
