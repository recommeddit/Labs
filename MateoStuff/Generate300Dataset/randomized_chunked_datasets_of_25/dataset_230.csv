64405,This is comical as wikileaks just posted information about the CIA targeting IOS and OSX with 0day exploits. If your running android you can run multiple antivirus apps that have a constantly updated registry so I don't see where you are getting at.

There are way too many doctors who just prescribe them anyway to placate their patients instead of actually explaining to them why it's not indicated. (Then again, there are way too many patients who refuse to listen...)",best medicine for a cold
23075,"I met Stephen Colbert when he came in to pick up a pizza from a pizza place I was eating at in Montclair, NJ. He was super friendly and chatted with us while he waited. My little brother has Down Syndrome; Stephen shook his hand and took the time to listen to him talk. All-around a really nice guy.

Edit: Spelling and a little more detail, this was back a few years ago when Stephen was still doing the Colbert Report; my girlfriend (now wife) and I wanted to bring my little brother out for pizza and we ran into Stephen. The guys at the pizza place obviously knew who he was, but they spoke to him more like he was just a regular at the place.",best celebrity

47190,"> St. Louis is one of the most under-appreciated cities in the US.

I've moved around a fair bit and visited many cities in North America, and I would have to agree. Some great museums, great food, and one of the top beer scenes in the country. The OP's girlfriend can get her shopping fix and the OP can get the typical ""American south"" experience he seems to desire. Plus, since he mentions theme parks, it is worth noting that the city has a Six Flags location. 

To the OP - if you go here for part/all of your trip, send me a message and I can make some suggestions as far as where to hit up.",best state to visit in the United States
