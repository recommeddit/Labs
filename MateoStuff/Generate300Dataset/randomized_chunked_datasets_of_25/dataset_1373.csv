Absolutely.

I never saw the appeal in beer. It was bitter and tasted like ass. Do people just tolerate the taste because it gets them drunk? Why not just drink a different form of alcohol?

72805,"- [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) for ease of use and support
- [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/) if you a want Windows-like UI and Ubuntu compatability
- [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) if you like the idea of a commercially back project
- [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) if you want a crash course on Linux systems as a whole

Starting from the top, Ubuntu and Mint (and any other Ubuntu based distro) will get you up on your feet and developing in Linux the fastest. Fedora is backed by Red Hat Linux, which is a commercial company and has a significant presence in enterprise, so that familiarity may be more beneficial if that's the kind of work you're going into. Arch is pain, but from that pain you'll learn a lot about *how* linux systems work and how to fix them.",best Linux distro
