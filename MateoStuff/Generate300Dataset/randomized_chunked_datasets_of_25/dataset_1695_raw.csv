"Based on my experience with other Monoprice products, this guy is definitely on to something."
"Yes as well as dpkg. It also has its own package manage system.

Me neither. It was my biggest surprise when compiling this list. I expected it to be six or seven spots lower.
Majored in engineer. Would have majored in computer science because of how much programming and software are so highly valued in today's society.
"If the kid can't spell Halloween, the candy is for the parents.  Give him an extra chocolate bar and tell him it's for his fatass mom.  Tell the kid to ask her why she needs so much candy.

If the kid is sarcastic when he spells it, he's too old for it.  But, his parents are probably dicks and don't buy him fuckall.  Tell him to explain his justification for his costume, then give him  a handful and close your door on his face.  You'll each think you've won.

If the kid is proud he knows how to spell it and smiles whilst doing so, give him a second handful.  He'll need it to bribe the bullies from giving him atomic wedgies from now til Christmas break.  By then, hopefully, his mom will put some clothes under the tree that don't make him look so gay."
"Is it advisable for tourists to dive into the culture? I have read that it isn't recommended to go off resort in Cancun. SO is in a wedding and wants me to go next year, but I have moral misgivings with the treatment of locals. Do you have any insight?"
This man knows the way to my heart

"Jesus, I literally have one of these sitting on my desk rn that I’ve been using for months!"

"Realistically you are not going to ""beat"" a cold in 24 hours, the best you will be able to do is minimise the symptoms.

Your best bet (assuming no allergies) is to treat:
 - Aches
 - Congestion
 - Running nose

Most people reach for OTC cold and flu medications or antibiotics, and while the former will help, the later will do literally nothing.

What works for me is asprin, $1 at the shops and no aches, as for congestion, a steamy shower (or just breath over a bowl of boiling water) will knock out the congestion.

Drink lots of fluids and avoid things that dehydrate you."
i like you
Air compressor...he loves it.
"Neither did I but it seems to do fine.  Saffron needs a similar rain cycle to the west coast.  Crocuses do great in the PNW.  Not a lot of late frosts here.  Actually some of the leaves survived the snowpocalypse in November and they look like adolescent chives right now.  

I can't comment on whether the flavor develops fully or not.  I have some in partial sun, I will move some to a sunnier spot when they go dormant again and that'll give me a better comparison."
We don’t focus on the Mexican-American war much besides the Alamo in my experience. The focus at that point was on Texas and the increasing tension between slave and free states in the buildup to the Civil War.
I love the Nike Lunaracer+ 3.  Too bad most stores in my area just pretends it doesn't exist.
"For being an engineer your posts sound a lot like straight from the marketing department, which is probably what nets you all the down votes."
"You really don't need to worry about backend stuff yet. Just learn javascript. Everything there is to know about it. write it, read it, make cool tools with it. Read JS the good parts, study client side frameworks. Learn jquery. There's a shortage of people who are really good in JS. 

After that get into node.js. Because you'll already know javascript and node is so easy for quickly making web servers."
No you couldnt... the interest alone on 500k would be like 3.5k a month... and earning 800k/year would mean your taking home around 450k a year after taxes and 401k
Are Excel developers aware of these things? Is there a way you can tell them? Or is Excel not going to change any time soon?
"LL Bean makes the best backpack, lifetime warranty they never break or tear. I’ve had one since first grade that I use for airport travel and one I’ve had since 7th I’ve been using ever since. Not sure about style when it comes to what your looking for but if you want your money’s  worth, this is your best bet"
Ah so you don't really use anything then
"Most Ad Blockers sold out, I've been seeing ads on twitch and youtube and found this post.   
AdGuard is something I just tested and it works like a charm.
