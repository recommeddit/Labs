How do I get included in this? I think we need more than 6 or 7 games that casual gamers can enjoy.
"Usually not hydrogen peroxide, *SOMETIMES* carbamide peroxide, and often a lesser oxide (that is more shelf stable). 

Basically hydrogen peroxide is about 3x as potent as carbamide peroxide, and (I apologize it's been 5 years since I worked with them) the lesser oxide is about 1/20th as potent as H2O2. Basically it lets them claim it's got whitening capability on the box, but it really doesn't do much

The amount of oxidation they provide is so insignificant that you won't see a difference. The whitening strips *kinda* work, but to get timely results, you really need to speak to a dentist and get something a bit more powerful.

As of 6 years ago, the highest H2O2 offered was 35% gel for use in dental offices, and 35% carbamide peroxide for in home tray use. don't know what they use now, I never want to see another dental picture again.

(I worked at DenMat, the company that created Rembrandt Toothpaste and also makes some fairly good dental products)"
"Sorry for maybe not being clear. I *could* just use my iPad alone logged into zoom, but then I don't have easy access to the zoom controls and students, chat window, email, etc, that I have on my Desktop and can easily monitor while lecturing, and where I can fast switch between applications. My paradigm is even more clunky if I try to just use the iPad alone, than logging both into my desktop and iPad."
i'd recommend the single season (8 episodes) of [*Hooten & the Lady*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5663062/) (2016)
"Interesting topic. I generally think of reliability as model-series specific and not brand-specific. Every brand has its hits and misses, especially when you look at how many units they produce to meet every price-point.

Surface devices have been anything but reliable in my experience. If you've ever had the displeasure of opening one, then I think you'd agree they're not very repairable either. Seems to have taken pages out of Apple's book in that you better hope they keep chugging along (and to be fair, many do) but its probably going in the bin if something breaks.

Apple has an advantage in that they make fewer devices, most/all of them high-end. This gives them more brownie points for reliability compared to other brands that are averaged across their entire range.

Samsung I agree with based on limited anecdotes. I myself have a Samsung... something-or-other laptop that's very old and just refuses to die.

Dell has had more QC issues than most lately. Not sure what's going on but they seem to do a lot of platform/part sharing across their line-up. Most in the Precision line have been immune so far (apart from the ones that share platform with the XPS).

Lenovo.... sticking to the business-ey laptops, the Thinkpads remain reliable choices, perhaps thanks to their IBM DNA. Legion gaming laptops are good, as are a few other lines. Lenovo's probably the best example of the best and worst being under the same brand-name. That said, they seem to have made significant inroads towards improving the weaker parts of their line-up; Ideapads and the like.

ASUS seems to be consistently *okay.* If Lenovo's graph plots models at opposite extremes, ASUS's cluster towards the center.

Acer sells probably the most balanced laptops out there. So balanced that they seem underwhelming or out-of-place as other manufacturer's spend a lot more attention on 'consumer-facing' parts of the laptop such as the display/other finishing kit. They do cut corners at the low end, but almost never in a way that compromises functionality.

HP's made some weird choices lately. Their stuff tends to remain operational but seems to have a lot more *physical*/build-related failures. They still make some good laptops but those are more exceptions than the rule these days.

Rebadges- if you've seen one, you've seen them all for the most part. Good laptop-shaped-objects if you see them as a cheap desktop-replacement.

Though I find myself agreeing with many of your observations, I think its clear that reliability has more variables than can be accurately assessed in any objective way. We're better off looking at each product on its own merit rather than the badge on the lid."
"I'd say the Raiden glide is like 4/5 and otsu v2 is probably a touch over 3/5. It's still a good glide, not quite Raiden, but it has much better control üëç."

Stephen Colbert's Americone Dream.
I can‚Äôt help thinking he was originally called Captain Marvel when I think of how much like a Marvel movie it is.
Yeah guys can we get some facts about whitening toothpaste please? Am I really damaging my enamel? Isn't it worth it for shiny white teeth?

[uBlock Origin's Medium Mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode) works very well for this too; it requires a bit of work as well.
Have you ever considered that this sub hates the Chili Peppers because disliking them is actually an equally valid opinion to liking the?

"Thanks a lot for responding.  In looking at pictures, I would say mine is considered ""mild"", but is visible on the front of many teeth.  I have avoided the composite route because I hear they only last a few years and will need to be capped or replaced with porcelain veneers.  I usually think it's going to be too troublesome or costly and just deal with it."

"My wife and I are very much partners in our marriage, so the best gift is to be king for a day(or queen on mother's day). I'll get a card or something, but I'm really looking forward to sleeping in a bit, maybe a special lunch, no chores, etc."
The YSL has been my go to for a long time. Love it. Very classy smell.
"I've had mine since 2008, these bags are near indestructible.

Plus if it breaks, there's a lifetime warranty."
