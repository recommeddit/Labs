"Worked on a Music video with both Pee Wee Herman, and Karen Gillan.

Pee Wee was super dickish and demanding and made the producers lives hell the whole time, and I only saw him when he was needed on set, had to be driven to and from his AC dressing room 30 minutes to film site. Complained the whole time. Had his own catering. Showed up late.

Karen was super chill. Ate with the crew, answered questions about Doctor Who and Marvel, did costume changes in a pass van, and was generally down to earth and charming. 

Also very tall. Wasn't expecting that. I have a hard time with super attractive women already,  and her towering over people really added to that."
"The bluffs in the NE part of the state I hear are pretty cool to see. 

My parents kayaked some rivers up there and said as much."
"I was an extra in one of the early Harry Potter films. One of my friends was standing near Emma Watson in a scene, and tried to start a conversation with her during one of the long-ass breaks between shooting (there were a lot of special effects to reset). She looked him up and down like he was a piece of shit. That was many years ago now, though, and I guess it's fairly likely she was just being a young teenage girl about it.

Rupert Grint was a legend though. I met him at another film I was in, and he remembered me like a year later. Only had a brief chat but he was clearly a genuinely nice guy."
"Your predefined sure but you can choose to act however you want. Ruthless or be the ""good"" guy or in between, you know role playing. You dont get those choices in bb you always kill everything in your way except for a few npcs"
"not really tho. they literally only just came out a few years ago, one of them was only two weeks ago, they literally can't be genre defining"

"To anyone reading this: don't buy this unless you want to smell like 95% of all other men out there. It's a great scent, but holy cow everyone and their father wears it."
"Yeah I agree with everything you said and I’d like to reiterate that I still think it’s a great album lol. But yeah I love my experimental shit and production tends to captivate me more than lyrics in my long term views of an album, unless the lyrics are remarkable like TPAB or APOS, both of which are accompanied by some incredible beats. Guess I’m just not in love with 90’s boom bap production as a whole."

According to the release notes for VSCodium 1.32.0 ([https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases)) they did some work with arm64 - you might be in luck :)
I noticed I had a box cutter on me too. On the return flight. Noticed I'd taken it all the way out and brought it back by accident without it getting flagged.

"Hi ... emergency pediatrician here.  Not talking about any person's illness specifically here, but about colds in general.  Brace yourself.  NOTHING REALLY WORKS.    

Pseudphedrine in doses big enough to muck up sleep might make the nasal congestion somewhat better, sometimes lots better.  Fluids are good because of the buckets of snot you are eliminating from your body (= fluid loss) and because you want to keep that stuff nice and runny (not stiff and sticky).  In patients with no contraindications, ibuprofen helps with the headache, the muscle aches and the sore throat.      
So as a professional, what do I do?  Two ounces of scotch, lots of tea, regular ibuprofen for pain, and goooooooood movies.    

Hope this helps ..."
"That is on our list currently. It's been tough and many have removed only to be put back on. RIU looks nice, the reviews are consistent and the placement at the top of the 7 is good. But I get more of a ""hotel"" vibe than a resort one. I think it's due to not really being spread out. But I haven't written it off yet."

"It wouldn’t hurt to learn WordPress and PHP. A lot of companies out there want designers/developers who can crank websites out at a steady pace. That’s exactly what WordPress allows you to do. It may not be your final gig, but it will be a great way to get into the industry."
