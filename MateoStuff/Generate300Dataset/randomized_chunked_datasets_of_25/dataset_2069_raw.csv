"Nothing, lowest fps my games dip into is 65fps, but LFC kicks in above the lower bound of freesync with Nvidia gpus. Forexample, in 35-240 range, the LFC kicks in from 0-48fps, or in the default range (60-240) LFC used to kick in at 0-80fps and that caused the heavy brightness flickering, so I increased the range and the flicker is gone. With your 32"" G7 freesync range is even higher (80-240hz) so I assume LFC kicks in at 0-100fps, thats why 32"" owners used to report flickering even more than the 27"" owners!"
"A couple years ago I bought my mom a YSL Parisienne gift set.

The problem is that I really, really like it...

If another woman wore it I would feel so confused because it would remind me of my mom."
Hahaha assuming you're buying from amazon check reviews first for ratings you dont want a watered down fragrance do you.

"Necropost but the Sawyers are absolutely the best portable water filter on the market for backpacking. They're pretty much ubiquitous in the long-distance backpacking community. When I hiked the Appalachian Trail, pretty much every thru-hiker carried one. They are truly fantastic pieces of kit. They will thread to pretty much any standard water bag or water bottle with a screw cap thread so they're enormously versatile, and if you backflush them every now and then, and pre-filter heavily sedimented water through a rag/cloth/buff/shemagh/whatever to get the 'gunk' out before running the water through the Sawyer to filter the microbiological contaminants they will last a **very** long time.   


I'd recommend the Saywer mini because it's lighter and does the exact same job with only a moderately lower flow rate. And toss out the water bag it comes with and pair it up with an Evernew or a Platypus water carry bag with a standard thread which will allow you to filter a lot more water. 12/10 I bring this thing with me literally every time I go hiking. There's nothing in the world quite like freshly filtered spring water.  


There are alternative squeeze filtration systems like the katydin which are fine but Lifestraws in my opinion, while better than nothing, are dreadful in comparison to pretty much any alternative. They're awkward, weigh only a tiny bit less than a sawyer mini, and restrict you to drinking directly from dirty water rather than being able to filter and carry clean water with you when you're on the move."

Worst: Monster absolutely zero (not ultra, the one with the blue monster logo)"

"I would add that antihistamines do nothing to combat cold/flu symptoms. Unless you are also experiencing seasonal allergies, they just make you drowsy. And acetaminophen should not be taken with alcohol, and moreso than other OTC drugs, you should not exceed the maximum recommended dosage. Both can lead to serious, even fatal, liver damage."
