23589,best car racing video game,I can't belive I had to scroll so far down for this.
36827,best roller coaster at six flags,I haven't done Twisted Cyclone or Wonder Woman but I've done Railblazer and I liked Iron Rattler better than that. I also likes Iron Rattler better than Steel Vengeance and Twisted Colossus. Maybe I just got it on a really good couple of days but the first drop is my 2nd favorite drop on a coaster after X2 and the dive off the quarry wall is one of my favorite elements on an RMC. I liked the pacing of the ride and it's one of the few rides that I've gone into with really high expectations and still walked away from impressed.
30732,best country to live in,"There are plenty of very liberal small towns in the US, in just about every state. Stay away from the bible belt and you're fine. What rights is he taking away? My life has literally not changed in the slightest since he became president. Also, who the fuck said it was the best country in the world?"

73698,best matte screen protector for ipad,I really like the ones from Xiron on Amazon.  I've tried to get used to writing without a matte screen protector but can't get used to the feel.  I've used this on one as well as my families and they are all happy with the writing feel with them.
70432,best major to study in college,I always thought this job was pretty interesting. It's something everyone in modern society relies on without even realizing it. I considered it when I was in highschool for the insane job security.

70947,best movies with a cool twist,"The twist being that she was switched when she was young? That's what crumbled the movie for me and a lot of people. Questions arise like; Why didn't she just leave the underground? She knew how to get down there she would know how to escape. Where did they all get the red jumpsuits perfectly tailored for their size? Instead of killing normal people, why didn't they escape and just cause a media circus to expose what was happening underground? What were the motivations for the people underground to kill their doppelgangers in the first place? What the hell was the point of revealing that the people underground control the behaviors above ground? Wouldn't that mean, if one doppelganger chose to run away, the other would run away too? What was the point to have the people underground laugh and scream like monsters?

The movie is so full of plot holes it's crazy.  It's a sad excuse as a social commentary horror movie."
21155,best workout music,"[Derezzed : The Glitch Mob/Daft Punk Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN_MSyrq6-U) This is my favorite ""in the zone"" push out reps song. At about 45 seconds it times perfectly with my reps."

54790,best water filter,"Better question would be if you need one. Unless you live in Flint, the tap water is probably so clean that it doesn't need filtering. Your municipal water utility should have quality tests on file."
