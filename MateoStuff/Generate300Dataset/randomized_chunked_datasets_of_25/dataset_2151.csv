40514,best midrange GPU,Yeah
17486,best iOS game,"Good question… 

I would say normal mode is not too bad, there’s like
1 optional platforming section that is very hard, but combat isn’t super hard 

NG+ tho… idk, it’s hard to compare to Skyrim"
21184,best workout music,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWiyKgeGWx0&feature=youtube_gdata_player oh fortuna. Every set, every rep completed is a your victory over the weights. Your soreness is the warcry after the battle"
24340,best anime,"Without knowing anything about your taste, I would suggest starting with Cowboy Bebop.  It's a safe choice that almost everyone likes, and it has a good dub (although I watched it subbed)."
68251,best science fiction novel,"Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion - Dan Simmons - Probably don't really need to explain this one seeing how popular in this thread it seems to be.

Red Mars - Kim Stanley Robinson - I get that KSR and the Mars trilogy aren't for everyone, but I loved it.  I'm not necessarily a fan of the man's politics, but this book really profoundly changed the way I thought about a lot of issue, especially like environmental ethics and conservation.

Jurassic Park - Michael Chrichton - I know Crichton is a little too thriller/pop-lit for this sub, but I unapologetically love this book.  Heavily influenced my career direction in high school.

The Dark Forest - Cixin Liu - The end of this book just gobsmacked me.  Has some rough parts, but the finish is mind-blowing.

Use of Weapons - Iain M. Bainks - I'm maybe less enamored with the Culture novels as a whole, but I loved the structure and twist that that entailed."

11228,best backpack for college,"Depends on your class and your prof. Some you need to, and some won't let you use electronic devices. 


I personally like using laptop to take notes. 



And also textbooks are heavy. Most of the time you won't need them in class, and some text book you can get PDFs so it's much better."
27872,best breakfast foods,"This past christmas, my aunt who recently conquered esophageal cancer, came to spend time with my family.
For almost 9 months, my aunt never had barely any solid food, but relied on infusions of boost and other meal supplements to get her nourishment. 
She would watch TV every day and would see ads for McMuffins from McDonalds and wished for the day she could have one.

On Christmas eve night, my mum ran out to McDonalds and asked for 10 wrapping papers that McMuffins came in. The next morning, the look of my aunts face was priceless when she saw these homemade McMuffins wrapped up in the McMuffin papers, and I'll never forget how happy she was that she got her wish for one of her first solid meals in months

Since then, homemade McMuffins will always be at the top of my list"

27900,best breakfast foods,Cold pizza.
30279,best Mexican war to study,"Well, as someone living in Texas, its definitely biased to say the least, and, especially during the Texan revolution, (taught somewhat together) Santa Anna is made out as an evil doctor who turned his back on his people for power and that the Mexicans were heavily repressing Texas, and during the Mexican American war it is taught that, while the US did antagonize Mexican forces, they still started the war"
68736,best science fiction novel,It's great but not sure it's science fiction.
