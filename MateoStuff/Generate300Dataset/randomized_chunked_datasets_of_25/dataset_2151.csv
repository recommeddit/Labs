68251,"Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion - Dan Simmons - Probably don't really need to explain this one seeing how popular in this thread it seems to be.

Red Mars - Kim Stanley Robinson - I get that KSR and the Mars trilogy aren't for everyone, but I loved it.  I'm not necessarily a fan of the man's politics, but this book really profoundly changed the way I thought about a lot of issue, especially like environmental ethics and conservation.

Jurassic Park - Michael Chrichton - I know Crichton is a little too thriller/pop-lit for this sub, but I unapologetically love this book.  Heavily influenced my career direction in high school.

The Dark Forest - Cixin Liu - The end of this book just gobsmacked me.  Has some rough parts, but the finish is mind-blowing.

Use of Weapons - Iain M. Bainks - I'm maybe less enamored with the Culture novels as a whole, but I loved the structure and twist that that entailed.",best science fiction novel

27872,"This past christmas, my aunt who recently conquered esophageal cancer, came to spend time with my family.
For almost 9 months, my aunt never had barely any solid food, but relied on infusions of boost and other meal supplements to get her nourishment. 
She would watch TV every day and would see ads for McMuffins from McDonalds and wished for the day she could have one.

On Christmas eve night, my mum ran out to McDonalds and asked for 10 wrapping papers that McMuffins came in. The next morning, the look of my aunts face was priceless when she saw these homemade McMuffins wrapped up in the McMuffin papers, and I'll never forget how happy she was that she got her wish for one of her first solid meals in months

Since then, homemade McMuffins will always be at the top of my list",best breakfast foods
