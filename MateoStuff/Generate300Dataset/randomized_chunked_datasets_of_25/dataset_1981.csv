7173,best iPhone,"yep, None of my iphones, 3G, 4S, or SE1 have ever slowed down. It's apps become bloated, demanding more. Snapchat used to work on the iphone  3G when it came out before it became extremely bloated with junk"

4245,best text editor,"Unlike many other old (Emacs) or young (Atom, VSCode, etc.) editors, and unlike every IDE ever, Vim's architecture has never really been designed with extensibility in mind. It just doesn't have what it takes to be a *platform* so you get hack-ish plugins that compete with each others for mappings and CPU cycles.

Things are starting to look better for the IDE-envy crowd thanks to LSP, though."
37839,best Marvel movie,"Apparently, you missed the top of my post, in which I directly took a part of your post about how you thought the fight scenes in Civil War were magnificent.

Shang-Chi is literally the first and only entry in the MCU in which those fights came anywhere near that bar."

22475,best celebrity,"Nikki Sixx went to high school with my parents and was one of my moms best friends at that time.

I got to hang out in his dressing room when they had their first reunion tour. He's a really nice, humble dude. I wouldn't go as far as to say he's immature, but he was very boyish and teenager like. But I guess that's kind of what happens when you become a famous rock star at the age of 19. You never have to grow up."
