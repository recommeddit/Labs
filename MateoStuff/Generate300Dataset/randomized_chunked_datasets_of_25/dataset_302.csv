68875,best science fiction novel,"I read this one recently, I quite enjoyed the prose and I also felt that the world that it built was very beautiful and interesting. So I liked it, but I also don't consider it a knockout recommend. After the pluses that I listed as negatives I found it extremely plot-lite. Can't think of any other way to put it than to say that very little actually happens in it. Much of the interesting change in the characters or the interesting events happen (in my mind) before the events of the novel so it all just feels rather flat and low stakes."
24528,best anime,"Pretty nice variety you have, which is always nice to see in favorites lists. 

Here's my response from when a previous user once asked me:

Overall, I'd say I value quality character interactions, writing/dialogue, execution of themes, and directing. If an anime has at least two of those, I'm likely to enjoy it more than an anime that lacks those but happens to have fluid animation, an original premise, and a suspenseful plot (even though I love all those things too). 

So, here's my top 10 in rough order starting from my favorite. I've written near essays on why some are in my top 10, but I'll just give a brief reasoning here. This will be more personalized instead of tailored towards how I would recommend them to anyone else.

* [K-On!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On) - High school girls eat cake, drink tea, and sometimes play instruments. As I said in my above comment, this is one of the comfiest anime I've ever seen. The character interactions just feel so natural and like a true friend group. There's this sense of nogstalia present throughout the anime that reminds the viewer of the passage of time and how easily it can be for high school life to pass you by. I can watch any single scene of the show and immediately burst out into a smile.

* [Madoka Magica](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka★Magica?q=madoka) - A show about magical girls fighting witches. The directing and writing in this show is phenomenal and the accompanying soundtrack is a masterpiece. The characters are pitted in a harsh situation and all five of them share different philosophies towards the matter. Often has me revisiting the series for the stellar animation and questions it poses as to what the right decision in any given scenario presented. Even better on a rewatch due to picking up on the foreshadowing present.

* [Your Name](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa) - Likely many of the same reasons you loved it. The animation, color palette, background art, and character designs are all absolutely gorgeous. I love a romance so that quickly connected me to the characters. While I don't live in as a remote location as Mitsuha, I've always wanted to live in a big city so I immediately emphasized with her desires to move to Tokyo. The visual symbolism present throughout the film was masterful and upon a rewatch so many pieces of foreshadowing are made available that it becomes a completely different experience.

* [The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7311/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Shoushitsu?q=disappearan) - A sequel film to the series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya. Culminates the themes and characterization of the previous two seasons into a masterpiece of a film. The use of color and sound is nothing short of genius, the voice acting feels so *real* and the plot had me on the edge of my seat, even on a rewatch.

* [Oregairu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru?q=yahar) - In no work of fiction that I have listened to, read, or watched have I related to a character more than Hikigaya Hachiman. Witnessing his warped view of society and the pain he held towards feeling like an outcast only to mask that pain with a rejection of social constructs was like looking into a mirror of my younger self. The way the show depicted that this viewpoint on society and life is ultimately self-destructive opened my eyes towards how unhealthy my own beliefs and way of life were. I can't say I've completely changed as a result, but I am much more conscious now on how my attitude affects others, and I try (but usually fail) to be a little less cynical as time goes on.

* [Hunter x Hunter (2011)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011?q=hun) - A fun, heartwrenching, dramatic, and spectacular journey about a young boy setting out to explore the world and find his father. The immensely large cast feels fully fleshed out, even for characters that have greater relevance past a couple episodes. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and always sets the tone properly. It's one of the only long running shows that never dipped in animation quality. In one particular arc, neither side is seen as evil, but morally grey and the characterization in said arc is one of my favorites in all of fiction.

* [5 Centimeters per Second](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter?q=5%20centimete) - A film directed by Makoto Shinkai that is in my opinion the greatest depiction of what it means to drift out of love.

* [Love Live School Idol Project](https://myanimelist.net/anime/15051/Love_Live_School_Idol_Project?q=love%20live%20school) - As mentioned in the above comment, Love Live SIP is a cute anime with some dramatic moments. The bonding that occured between the girls (particularly in the second season) felt like a real friendship to me. There's a ton of fun gags throughout the show and the performances that the group puts on are great to listen to.

* [Akatsuki no Yona](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25013/Akatsuki_no_Yona?q=akatsuk) - As mentioned in the above comment, I **loved** the female protagonist in here. The unique setting drew me in from the start and I think the entire cast meshes extremely well.

* [Cardcaptor Sakura](https://myanimelist.net/anime/232/Cardcaptor_Sakura?q=cardca) - Magical girl anime with themes of hope, perserverance, and relationships (familial, platonic, and romantic). Sakura is one of the best written child characters I've seen in fiction, and the show is just comfy with most plot points being concluded within the episode.

* [No Game No Life: Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33674/No_Game_No_Life__Zero) - A prequel film to the series No Game No Life that I mentioned to you in the above comment. This film is just a suspenseful, dramatic spectacle to watch. The use of color, soundtrack, and voice acting are some of the best I've witnessed. Without going into any spoilers, there is enough similarity between this and the main series that the viewer feels familar with what's going on until certain elements are subverted."

73489,best battery bank,I believe it.  I met an ULer last autumn who complained that he was way too cold but stubbornly wouldn’t budge on his 1.5 pound bag. I’m toasty in my 2.0 pound bag.  I’ll accept the extra with happiness. I guess for some UL means ultra lousy.
26981,best board games,"I agree man! Most people in the hobby are adults and ""there's too many symbols"" is the weirdest form of gatekeeping I see exist as a trope in the hobby. I mean, yeah, it takes a little bit of work, but most folks I know see my kallax's full of games and ask ""which is your favorite?"" When I respond, their response is ""well can we play *that?""*  I've never responded with ""well, it's a bit much for someone who doesn't play games."" Just seems elitist and unwelcoming."
24259,best anime,this list is instantly good because Hidamari Sketch is on there
