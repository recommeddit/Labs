I don’t think Mexico could have won the war however they could have made it difficult for the USA had they won a battle or two and then British military and naval support which was on the table.",best Mexican war to study

55400,"If GGK's prose and character styling is your jam, and you don't mind slumming it in the Mos Eisley Cantina of fantasy sub-genres (LitRPG), check out my story, Dive: Endless Skies. It's a found family, fast action story with a fresh-faced heroine learning the ropes from lethal mercenaries who are more than meets the eye.

Alternatively (and let's be real, much more promising), if you haven't read the Traitor Son Cycle by Miles Cameron, give that a go. It has the hallmarks of epic fantasy BUT I think fits your bill with the pace, humor, and cast of wildly entertaining characters similar to Kings of the Wyld.

As a weird extra option, there is also Priest of Bones. It is very aptly described as Peaky Blinders in a medieval, low fantasy world. Kind of grim, but again, strong humor and very engaging cast of characters.",best action and adventure novel series

67533,"Even if they don't claim for it to be stable, I have used axios in production before with 0 issues. Its extensible middleware pipeline is a perfect candidate for enterprise environments, because you can add middle-wares to do important tasks like passing auth headers, asynchronous context propagation, transaction tracing headers, logging params to external service, etc. without exposing the details of  that to your end-users.

I built an internal http-client at an enterprise company using axios with the aforementioned functionality.",axios alternatives reddit
