The noises took me by surprise
"How do I make it so I can get into ""the zone"" any time I want? Last night I did it somehow and then I literally couldn't stop drawing. A lot of times drawing feels painstaking, but if I could get into the zone every day I would learn so quickly and be so productive.

Another totally unrelated question: I see some people do really small thumbnail sketches, or to sketch multiple gesture drawings to a page. But then some people tell me to draw large to learn to use my whole arm. Which is it lol?"
"UAG Monarch case, no other case even competes imo."
"Olive and Basil.

Effectively basil flavoured with olive chunks mixed in right at the end. Also added some pine nuts for texture which worked really well. The salty olives + sweet icecream worked quite well together, but keep the olive chunks small if you're going to do this... its kinda gross if they're too big.

I think it'd work quite well with caramel in there, as caramel + salt tends to be a good combo."
So much this! The ADK is my favorite part of the country.
"Same here.  He was a regular at my job in Santa Monica. Kevin James brought him in for his birthday.  Gave Adam my card/number but he never calls before he comes in,  doesn’t expect anything special."

"How about someone putting antibiotic in their eyes to pre treat for lasik and having a reaction? Are super swollen and runny eyes just a reaction? 

Some people are actually allergic. Officially allergy testing is probably a good idea though."
Because you sure as hell aren't going to make any money teaching here...
Gigantic fucking omelet (5 eggs minimum) with cheese & sliced Italian sausage. With a cup of espresso coffee.
I'm not disagreeing with any of that. I said that I considered Barcelona to be the higher ranked club.
"I don't bother with bottled water, but you have made me want to get some of this."
"If you explore individual countries, you can see a list of data on different metrics they use, including results.  It doesn't have the calculations, but at least it lets you know what kind of information they used to base their rankings on."
Cant open it in sudo tho

"Yeah right. That remembers me of something! What was it. Oh yeah! It was:  ""ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN CJ!"""
Digimon Cyber Sleuth. If you like Digimon and Pokemon games this is perfect for you.
"Yardley lavender was my mom's scent as well. I had no idea it had been ruined, I think picking up the awful one at one point might have ruined my taste for lavender forever."
Death Grips
"Dired, because Emacs."
Aquaman is literally a Holy Grail movie with a comic book veneer.
Around 25 missions compared to GH's 90ish missions. It's pretty much Gloomhaven light. Setup is more streamlined (no tiles like base GH) and there is less variety but overall very representative and true to original GH. It's a perfect test to see if the game is for you.
"My mistake, 0.23 ounces."
"Bubbling? Wow... So far, for mine, the only part that has started to peel of is near the Lightning port which is kinda understandable.

I dropped the phone once and there's a very tiny chip on the left edge of the screen.

So you think the quality had dropped?"
