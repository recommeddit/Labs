"Both are easy, doesn’t matter"
"Yes! Do technical focus, you can still take the acting classes and perform in school productions to build up experience and network with local companies."
That's the spirit!
What happened with the staff?
"Probably just because I'm a kiwi, but:

The New Zealand Wars.

The British Empire sent large numbers of it's elite soldiery, armed with high-tech weaponry against ""the natives"", from about 1843 to about 1870.

The locals, with no full-time army, adapted quicker then Empire could have imagined, creating disposable death-trap fortifications, impervious to cannons and rockets,  employing tactics and strategies that would be themselves be adapted by the British in Crimea and WWI.

""One authority calculated that Gate Pa absorbed in one day a greater weight of explosives per square metre than did the German trenches in the week-long bombardment leading up to the Battle of the Somme.""

The Maori tribes were never really collectively defeated. The outcome was far from a simple conquest. The Tribes won many battles. Sometimes most of them on some campiagns. Ultimatly they won their rights on the battlefield."
I love Izipizi sunglasses! Great value
University of Wisconsin is highly regarded
TY OP!
"LT, Rice, Reggie White, and maybe Rodgers rounding up my Mt. Rushmore"
"It's a meta ranking. If several of the sources rank school A ahead of school B and students like going to school A more than school B, then A will be ahead of B. 

I think CMU took a hit because it's student ratings are not stellar."
Sounds like my childhood and your college experience were very similar
"Yes! And it also has a ""funds"" function."
"Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, DIRT Rally, iRacing, Trackmania...

Gran Turismo 3+4 if you're willing to use a Playstation 2 emulator."
"The difference is only if you work in a studio and need certain impedance for certain source devices. That's the only reason they make it in various impedance versions. 99,99% people could never tell any difference between these and if they say they do, they lie. So for your convenience get lower impedance version which needs less input power to get them working good. Regarding gaming, I have always been playing using closed headphones, mainly Counter-Strike where positioning of footsteps etc. is very important. I have mostly used Audio Technica SJ5 and currently Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro (250Ohm). People have been surprised on several occasions how much and early I was able to hear and I also feel pretty confident about it so I say closed design is nothing but good for the purpose."
I bought the same case that’s in the photo for my i8+ and I’ve been using it ever since! I love things that last
Yes you are right.
"LADDM is more warm, spicy, dry, sweet. It feels like walking around a souk in midday sun.

ACDD is warm and cold at the same time. I feel like this one is more ethereal than spicy, feeling like a desert in the night. It’s still warm and comforting at the same time. It gets to me on a very fundamental, „primordial“ level, hugging me and being around me. I feel like this one is more of a feeling and less of a perfume in comparison to LADDM. I think LADDM is really good as well, but for me I prefer the pure and lonely heart of the desert."
Agreed
Oxford Suites comes immediately to mind. Rooms are just as nice and it would be a lot cheaper. Service may not be as lavish.
"Knockaround makes some really nice and stylish shades for anywhere from $15-$35. You can pretty much find any lens and frame combo with them and if not, you can customize your own for under $50 I think. I just got a pair of Joopin Ray-Ban-style clubmasters off Amazon for $13 and they've held up surprisingly well!"
khao*
I mean developing on Windows is a huge hassle.
"Meh, not to me unless its on an ultra-wide."
"Jagermeister. If you can't breath though, I would suggest boiling a bot of water, dropping some eucalyptus oil in it, and just hold your head above the steam. You'll have magically clear sinuses so fast."
KI is great but I have that place a few pegs below both CF CW parks.
