"Steve Young is really interesting to see him move up so much his career was well over before the last list.

I wonder if Aaron Rodgers ""carried"" him up the list since Rodgers has always been compared to him."
"Its one of my favorite shots! Seriously.  Fill shot glass almost full with Whipped cream vodka, top off with a bit of frangelico. Place salt on hand, like salt and take shot.  Its EXACTLY like a chocolate covered pretzel. How? Idk, alcohol magic."

"I disagree. I think Disney is in trouble in Orlando. They are the obvious draw for international visitors, but Universal Orlando is catching up quickly here in the states. They have expanded wildly this decade and look to do even more in the next. Disney is now finding themselves playing catch up in trying to out-theme Potter, as it's become THE thing to see in Orlando for teens and millennials. I was driving to see Galaxies Edge this year and i drove past SeaWorld and saw Mako and wondered why the hell i'm not spending my day there. Plus Universal is about to open another park? Disney better look out."
You mean the black or strata?
My wife loves hers
"Kaplan at least has regional accreditation, unlike U of Phoenix, which is nationally accredited. National accreditation is generally reserved for for-profit schools, and don't hold much weight. Regional accreditation holds significantly more value."
George Washington. Guy got offered the United States multiple times and turned it down.
That’s my list
I am not.
Lol all of gvf’s music is hella good
Didn’t even know that existed. Thanks for the recommendation that sounds like a good idea
"I don’t know if calling this Imperialism makes sense in this context. All of the occupied territories were fringe territories of Mexico, with *extremely* few Mexicans actually living there.

I think it’s fair to call this imperialism with respect to the natives living there, but I don’t really see how Mexico would have the moral high ground since they (really Spain) basically did the same thing: just decided that this territory all belonged to them—not because their people lived there—but because they wanted the land. The effect of the war on most of the people living in those areas was to swap out one imperial overlord with another."
"Last car game I bought for PC is Need for Speed: Carbon, still worth playing it and its predecessor Most Wanted if you have never done so. Another arcade car game is Test Drive Unlimited, which has a huge map, if you're​ into that (there's even a race around it, which IIRC takes about an hour to complete!)."

"> Do you take issue with using evidence?

No, you misunderstand.  Here's some reading material.

Logical positivism is dead:

> [Interviewed in the late 1970s, A J Ayer \[a major proponent of positivism\] supposed that ""the most important"" defect ""was that nearly all of it was false"".  ... John Passmore found logical positivism to be ""dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism)

**[Postpositivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositivism)** is the currently accepted approach.  It doesn't reject positivism, but rather amends it to include the soft sciences / social sciences."
Death in Paradise
Ranger is the way to go.
Even better if you notice he didn't actually relapse in the last scene. He just didn't want to live with it anymore
"Yeah, I'm surprised to see Neuromancer in the top 20.  

It was probably better in the 80's when it first came out, but it has aged *horribly*."
The sinner
Both of the Last Of Us have awesome stories.
"you are definitely wrong about madvillainy though, it is definitely one of the best hipho albums of all time, literally every song is done well and doom and madlib both bring their best. Endtroducing is kind of boring compared to dillas donuts, but it is undoubtedly an enjoyable classic but i dont think any hhh would put it in a top 10, so i agree on that part."
Agree Business Calendar 2 is very good.  Also Digi cal is a good option.
What do dentists think about the fluoride and how it supposedly ‘blocks the powers of the pineal gland’?
