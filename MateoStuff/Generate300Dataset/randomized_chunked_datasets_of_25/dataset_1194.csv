6336,best Netflix documentary,"""Unseamly"" its on discovery plus, theres a 1 week free trial but if you like crime docuseries its def worth it! 

""Unseamly"" is about canadian Peter Nyguard who is almost as bad, if not worse, than Jeffrey Epstein. if you are sensitive to sex trafficking then i wouldnt recommend because descriptions can be graphic but its a CRAZY story"

62803,Best Data Science textbook,"I'm wondering how important Continuous Probability is for Data Science. I'm registered for Probability theory this coming semester which covers the first 5 chapters of Mathematical Statistics by Wackerly.

However I'm entering my 3rd year CS and have some pretty brutal classes coming up so I'm not sure if it'll be too much.

DS and Data Analysis are some of my consideration for my career so I'm wondering how important Continuous Probability is. Additionally should I take Mathematical Statistics the following semester? I think it covers chapters 6-9 of the Wackerly book but id have to double check."
10975,best backpack for college,"I got this one on Black Friday. Original was $80 and I got it for $40! Very nice, good quality, lots of pockets and zippers. Only negative is it has 2 set of straps (one for chest, one for around waist area). The chest strap can be removed they‚Äôre just buttons but the others can‚Äôt.

42862,best detective show,"I personally thought the first episode was super interesting. The second episode was alright and the final episode would pretty generic like any other crime documentary I've ever seen. That being said, the ending is wack as fuck like you said. Bitch, I am not responsible for you accidentally getting the wrong guy and for some psycho being a psycho on the internet."

7184,best iPhone,"If you don‚Äôt have another device for multimedia consumption, I‚Äôd say go for the 11 or a refurb XR. The battery and screen is definitely worth the extra money."
61870,Best RPG game on PS4,yeah it is largely pointless
34046,best Pokemon game,"Fair warning, few people like either version of sun or moon and I might be biased against x and y"
6714,best iPhone,"Well an iPhone or Samsung flagship is $1000+ 

So if you don't need it, you can go with another brand. I suggest android with a replaceable battery.

I'm got a Motorola. It's got a good camera, midgrade but still good processor, and the battery lasts for several days. It was under $400."

Is that it? I‚Äôm on my phone so perhaps it‚Äôs a platform issue...."
11490,best gifts for dad,"Is this a real thing, or are you messing with me?"
7208,best iPhone,"I think you should wait and buy an iPhone 12 with 256 GB storage, if you're someone who's not careless with your phone. (If you break the screen a lot, or are likely to lose it in a river or a club, get the iPhone 7 or 8.)

With a used iPhone, you can never be 100% sure of what you're buying. Battery might disappoint you. It won't feel like much of an upgrade, and the model might stop being supported in just two years. If you buy a large storage iPhone 12 now, you can pretty much guarantee 5+ years of quality use. (My 6S turns 5 this November.). I personally believe 5G will be such a milestone for the iPhone that the 12 and 12 Pro will be supported for like 8 years."

29242,best game console,"On a budget I‚Äôd say PSP/Vita(more expensive). The modding and emulation capabilities are endless and has a very manageable entry price point. 

More expensively I‚Äôd go the route of the PS5 or Nintendo switch. The PS5 gets the latest and greatest gaming technology in your hands with a growing library of great games as well as access to the PlayStation collection games. The switch rivals most current gen consoles with having an gigantic library of games and the ability to take it on the go.

Honorable mention the Nintendo 3DS"
