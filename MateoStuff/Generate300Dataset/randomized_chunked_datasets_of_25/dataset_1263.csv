13243,"I looked through all these, and as a mother of a soon to be 3 month old, I wouldn't wqnt any of these.  Not because they're not good gifts, but just because they're not good gifts for me.

Good gifts for me?  Silhouette machine or stand mixer because those are tools that would make my hobbies easier and more fun.

Becoming a mom didn't cause my interests and hobbies to change.  You know your wife better than a bunch of strangers.  Get her something for HER.",best gifts for mom

35384,"My personal favourite, long Island iced tea, definitely fits the bill. Make sure you use sugar syrup instead off adding granulated sugar like some degenerate recipe makers would have. 

1 part vodka
1 part white rum
1 part tequila 
1 part cointreau
1 part gin
1 part sugar syrup
1 part lemon juice 

Mix in shaker. Half fill a highball glass with ice, fill half way with cola and gently top it up with the deadly mix of spirits. It'll look like a haribo cola bottle if done correctly.

So many anime lists are written through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy and I often find myself wading through hours of explosions and fanservice to find anything remotely of interest to someone who hasn't been a teenager for a couple of decades. For example, neither Mushishi nor Cowboy Bebop making the top 25 at [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) says a lot about the voting demographic.",best anime

49575,"oh my god oled panels are the best. It's a shame that  burn in is still somewhat of an issue, so they arent making any smaller (27 - 32"") monitors. And 48"" is way too big for me, and these two TVs ofc are way too expensive. I currently have the 27"" IPS LG GL850, which is (was?) considered a very good monitor, however the low contrast, terrible blacks/grays etc, and bleed are just fking the worst. Kinda wish I had bought a VA panel, maybe it'd be better..
