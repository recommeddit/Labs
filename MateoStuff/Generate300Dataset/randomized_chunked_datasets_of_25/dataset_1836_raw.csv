"On a podcast the other day, the Totally Football guys casually mentioned the Cup Winner's Cup as being the third ranking European trophy of the time."

"Great list thank you.  13 Minutes to the Moon is pretty great right now, I'd check that out if you haven't yet!"
"Its a good thing, specially having other options besides Sileo.... i use cydia and will use till it no longer works, and when that time comes, Sileo is not the one i will use."
"[Every Frame A Painting](https://youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting). 

It's a pretty easy binge since there aren't a lot of videos, but all of them are very high quality. Sucks that he said he won't be making anymore."
"Sucks that the channel *that got the most views* turned into those view whoring kid channels

Edit: The original video was uploaded in '05, while the one I'm thinking about (which got significantly more views) was uploaded in '06. My mistake"
"No one will see this or care but I felt like saying it anyways:

My mom cut out several years ago and shes long given up trying to have a relationship with me. Being the only girl out of 6 children, my dad didn't really know what to do with me at the time, a brass 14 year old with a short temper.  But he sat there through every dramatic break up, hair-brained scheme, and vain attempt at normality I've endured.  

I always call my dad on Mother's Day to thank him for being the best mom he could be for me.  I often take 20 mins out of my day and reflect on our time together, trade a few jokes, or share a teary eyed remark.  While he still may not fully understand the inner workings of my brain, he certainly tries.  He helped pick out my prom dress, offers dating advice, and never judges me for bad decisions.

Acknowledge your ""mom"" on Mother's Day.  Doesn't matter how poor your are, you can still afford a heartfelt conversation with that person."
"The game is actually really well made for controller and splitscreen play, I was surprised. I beat the game solo on PC but wanted to play with a buddy later on. We split screen co op and both used controllers. The dev's clearly took the time to make it smooth."
"Russians, both black and white.  
Whiskey Sour.  
Sidney Ice Tea if I'm feeling frisky.  
Weißbier, Blondes or Saisons if we're talking beer.  
Something citrusy and semi-dry if we're talking bubbles."
Coherence (2013). It’s a fantastic story with what you’re looking for.
"Con: Every horizontal surface in your home *will* become covered in rocks.

Liquid Swords and Ready to Die
Thanks. Imma check these out!
Yes! I forgot to mention that. Mids do have issues with sticking on the desk.
And Persona 5 Royal is just amazing.
What makes Minneapolis better than St. Paul?
Mid-range starts with rx 5700/2060 imo
Such a perfect analogy.
"They killed production of the 12 mini, yes. They are still expected to release a 13 mini before ending it in 2022.

"Actor here and . . . yeah, he is pretty much right. My wife (also an acting major) runs a theatre education program for kids, and I travel around giving presentations to high schoolers, so we are both *kind of* in our field, but we're the lucky ones. Dozens of the other actors from my program went to New York and LA, some of them *very* talented, hard-working, attractive, everything you could hope for. None of them are making a living acting, not a single one, and most of them are working in the service industry.

*However*, I am convinced that Acting is perhaps the single best major for learning people skills. Nobody really hires exclusively for that, they want an expert in one area who also happens to already be a people person, but perhaps a double major would work out well?"
You just need a really heavy glass so that every time you take a sip you do a curl.

"Persona 5

Nier Automata

Valkyria Chronicles

Witcher 3

Fallout 4

I don't consider the Souls/Borne-Franchise as classic RPGs but more Action-Adventures like Zelda. Same goes for Nioh. Must haves btw."
"most energy drinks are good for this, however I would recommend XS as it uses vitamin b12 as it's main ingredient which helps with mood and focus.

If you want to know more I go into more detail in my [blog](https://energydrinkreviews.siterubix.com/xs-brand-of-energy-drinks/)."
I like this guys way better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI-YYWDYXJ4
