13232,best gifts for mom,"I support all the ideas of ""time away!"" I'd also suggest a gift cert to a local store they enjoy shopping at/malls/etc and maybe with their favorite drink/coffee/ etc. Just stuff they like to do alone that they can't get the opportunity.

OR give them a day (without the money) alone and you get the house scrubbed professionally.  Like ""I got you this Coffee and a day alone and don't come home until 4pm because theres another surprise"""

10451,best suitcase lock,"**DO NOT BUY OR USE THAT STYLE OF LOCK.**

They are extremely easy to unlock, requiring no effort or guesswork.  By applying downward pressure to the locking ring, pulling on it as you would to open it, you force the dials to stop rotating at their ""unlock"" position.  Basically all you'd have to do is pull on it, turn the dials until they stop, release tension and pull again.

47039,best hand santizer brand,"So it’s kinda like this: there’s a difference between antibiotics and sanitizer.

Let’s think about if you wanted to wreck someone’s car: you could do a small targeted attack (cut a brake line, drain the fuel, ruin the steering). For every strategy you choose, they can improve it (locked fuel door, etc). You could also take the less glamorous approach and just completely destroy the car baseball bat at midnight style.
