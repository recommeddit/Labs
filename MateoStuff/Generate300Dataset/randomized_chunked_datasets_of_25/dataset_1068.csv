Also, I said in another comment, which people are having fun downvoting, that I realize the differences in shades and tones of white (or any color). I was making a joke which no one seems to have understood.

Hava good one."
12410,best gifts for mom,"I work a rotational schedule so on my days off, I go on adventures. I was in montana and found out about sapphire mining.  So I went and found about 150 carats of sapphires and had a few good ones worth getting cut. I ended up getting 13 stones heat treated and cut. I took two of the nice square cut ones and had them made into ear ring or studs or whatever they're called. 

She really liked them"

10937,best backpack for college,"I’m an incoming freshman and just recently got myself a Swiss gear backpack at Sam’s Club. I really like how durable it is so far and the large amount of pockets it has.

But throughout most of high school I used High Sierra backpacks which are relatively cheap and also great quality. I would suggest looking at warehouse clubs like Costco or Sam’s Club. Sometimes they have good deals for good brands of backpacks. My Swiss Gear was only $40."

52182,best hiphop album,There’s a lot more to rap than lyricism imo. There’s lots of great modern hip hop that doesn’t have the most profound lyricism.
60891,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I would argue that by the end of the series Todd Margaret is the everyman the viewer can relate to. However, during most of the series, Alice is truly the everyman. She is trying to make her own place in the world and this bumbling fool screws her over consistently while trying to actually help. 

Spoilers below, I guess.

[The lens through which we see the absurd is clearly Alice. Todd has no concept of social norms. We can see this in the first episode during the breakup. Clearly Stephanie didn't think they were dating. It was a one night stand. But Todd has no roots in reality. 

Quite a bit of the first season is Todd having no comprehension of English society. Consider the parade, when Todd gets dressed up in Union Flag clothes and shoes his ""patriotism"" while all hopped up on thunder muscle during what should be a somber day. Or when he tells Alice that he lives in the houses of Parliament. He really has no clue and this becomes the comedy. You can see how cringey this is for Alice. She knows that nobody actually lives in Parliament, but Todd just goes as far as he can to keep up with his lies.

As far as the writing is concerned, I think that it's intelligently written. There isn't just the absurdist slapstick, there is another layer of humor that you may not have understood. For instance, when Todd's father comes and is forced to pretend he is a ghost. Will Arnet's character is scared of ghosts and Spike Jonze says, ""I don't understand how you could be afraid of ghosts, while they are superior athletes they lack the brain power of lighter peoples"" or something to that effect. Ghosts being a less common epithet for blacks. That's something less informed or less intelligent viewers might not pick up on, but at the time is actually really funny. You don't expect the nerdy little guy to be blatantly racist, not having shown this in any way before.

I think the pacing and overall editing are pretty on point. Something terrible happens to Todd or because of Todd every episode, and it never really slows down. The viewer is left in the dark about several sub plots until they pay off. A perfect example is John Hamm playing the Butler. You see him for several episodes and until he asks to leave to resume filming on Mad Men, you think he is just playing a part.

Now, as for the title, The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret sums up the show pretty well. Just when you think that he can't dig himself a bigger hole, he does. He tries to show Alice that he is a good person and gets Alice her dream job, but in order to convince the chef to hire her he says that Alice is mentally handicapped and terminally ill. As if one of those things wasn't enough, or bad enough.](/spoiler)

I understand if you don't like the show, it may not be for everyone. But to tell people that it's awful and to avoid it is a bit extreme. #s"

17550,best iOS game,"Battle for Polytopia is great. It’s a civ-lite turn based strategy game. The IAPs are just for additional tribes, but you don’t need to buy them to enjoy the game. 

Probably my most played iPhone game. Good for quick bursts.

3430,best webcamera,"You missed my statement then completely.... I see countless time people are not streaming just asking reddit for the best graphics/mics/cameras (which is fine) but they are not streaming too while they are just casually playing. Not even just recording. When you are not streaming/recording you are missing Opportunity to create something to put on another network for discoverability. I understand fully the people without webcams are the exception but no one is blowing up overnight when they buy the best webcam... You start by getting out there on another platform and what better way to do that is just start streaming so you can download the vods to make a clip or even just recording all your gameplay.

I'm just using streaming as an example to have your vod somewhere to download to create clips...you could just record strictly your gameplay instead of streaming but if you atleast press the go live button you can practice streaming cause many many many of us will stream to less than 5 people for a long time

Edit: also, if you are worried about missing up your twitch stats by just turning on your stream with no webcam or whatever you can always have a dummy account that you can use so you can go live whenever you are casually playing and not worry about ruing your (main account) and it's branding."
