"I studied Math, Stat, Econ, Religion. Im now getting a MS in CS. I would have doubled in Math and CS and dropped stat. But I did what I loved and the rest followed (CS was just starting at my UG when I was there so it wasn't on my radar at all). 

Finance is good if you want to be a financial analyst/get your financial certifications. Get internships and see what the life is like ( typical hours, lots of certifications, etc)."
"My father passed away last month after struggling for years with his illness. Because of all the expenditures and hospitalizations during his lifetime, it has been years since the last time they celebrated Christmas without having to compromise other expenses. 
This year, my brothers and I are going to decorate her house and buy her a Christmas tree and set everything up before she gets home from work on Christmas day. My sisters-in-law and I are going to make dinner and my eldest brother is flying in with his family from Japan. 
Although there will be an empty chair this Christmas, at least she will be with the five blessings my father gave her."

The challenge of the latter is love :)
I would personally say team fabulous 2 by kitty0706
For this reason I like to check out categories like “Family” or “Strategy” - usually brings a few more fun playable ones into the mix. :)
"Ultimate go-to for me is Perry Ellis red. Most of their stuff isn't amazing,  but that one is awesome.  It's a great,  inexpensive aqua di gio clone that works in almost any day time situation.  Very fresh and bright. I have about 30 colognes and I've used half a bottle of that stuff.  Another good one I wear a lot is Unpredictable Adventure,  which is an Aventus clone. I've heard there is an even better clone out there,  but I haven't tried it.  It smells great though, can be worn almost any time. These are both very inexpensive and very high quality for the price. If you haven't bought cologne before, I don't recommend dropping 300 bucks on one bottle when you don't even know what you like,  and there are many many high quality inexpensive brands/ clones/ testers out there. 

Also:  love love love Noble Fig by Ferrari. I wear it all the time in the summer.  I've heard their bergamot one is great too."
"Mad Max: Fury Road, Dredd, John Wick 1-3, The Night Comes For Us, The Raid, Kill Zone 2, Kick-Ass, Kingsman, Blade of the Immortal, Robocop, The Villainess"
"Admittedly only read the first half of the book because I couldn't get through it (I was previously a fan of FiveThirtyEight but reading the book was a shock to me). It sounds like I may have missed something in the latter part of the book where he refutes his earlier ""claims to fame"".

I want to make clear that I *do not* think that Nate Silver is more terrible than others in his area of election forecasting and the like - in fact, I think he is far better and more ""statistically-minded"". I simply tried to make a point that I was under the impression he was a rigorous statistician and the fact is that he is not. This goes back to my point that he does not publish his models and thus is not scrutinizable which is to say that he is unverifiable in his claims.

Maybe this should be in /r/gatekeeping but as far as I'm concerned, someone who does not subject their work to scrutiny through transparency or else peer-review isn't a rigorous statistician."
I only agree if you're talking about pewdiepie's version lol
The blessings of Muad’Dib be upon you!

"I know, because I have watched every episode. They used disguises to get into the party. They then discarded them when they started fighting. Oh, Jimbei and Robin were the sober ones in the attack. The next episode will focus on Sanji and his weakness for women. There are better animes than One Piece."
Chinese knock off ken block things. Avoid the white frames and blue tint and you wont be that wanker tradie.
"Didn't know about The Algorithm Design Manual. Just bought it, I hope I will ne regret it :-P"
"Some people can do a loan through Kindle, if they already own it. I'm not exactly sure how it works?"
"I'm a journalist and prefer Cherry MX Clears. I've owned boards with Blues and Browns as well and have a switch tester. Clears are a bit heavier than blues or browns, and don't have the extra audible click as blues/greens, but I find their sound to be plenty. Clears have a bit more of a bump than browns too."
I cry like a bitch every time I watch The Orphanage.
"I'm in the exact same position, want to jump on the LG but have time to wait a few months I'm not in a rush. Curious what replies here will say."
"Truthfully they have still been doing mostly raid and facility events. But they have added defensive battles and this month we will get a new mode called onslaught (solo wave based event). The new end game bosses have been very enjoyable. Less scripted OHKO moves, more reactable and forgiving mechanics with a wider range of acceptable character pool usage. 

But truthfully if you hated the controls not much has changed on that front. Rolls have invincibility frames now and some of the basic attack strings changed but that’s about it."
Exactly what I was going to say! (I mean aside from the wife and mother thing) 10/10 best thing I’ve ever purchased for myself
"Oh man, how could I forget... Thanks for reminding me about that!"
Very odd. I have never been in a Home Depot that did not offer it at all times.
