I definitely think it is good to be thinking more and more about the evolution and ecology of cancer. I don't think we are currently at a stage where we can predict much about the game without measuring it directly. This is mostly because we've measured so few of them (our paper might be the only measurement, maybe one or two prior works can be recast as similar measurements in hindsight). Our hope is that we will be able to say something more general and empirically grounded about games in the near future; especially how games transform under therapy.

There is, however, a lot more theoretical work on evolutionary game theory in cancer. A key name to look for there is David Basanta. As a random side node, he is also into podcasting, and is part of the team behind the [2Scientists podcast](https://2scientists.org/). It is a different format (interviews) from yours and a bit less focused, but also fun.

You should definitely share the game assay paper with the lab. I'm eager to hear any feedback you might have. Feel free to reach out to me by email or [twitter](https://twitter.com/kaznatcheev)."
53417,best usb c charging cable,"You have to do a little bit with Anker because they sell a ton of cables. They have like five different USB-A to Lightning braided cables alone between their normal line up, the Powerline II, and now Powerline III and both of the Powerline versions have two revisions. For what, I don't know.

In terms of quality though, yea. I picked up one of the braided cables for my car since it sits in the sun fairly frequently and the insulation on Apple cables kept peeling and cracking. So far, so good."
