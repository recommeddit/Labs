"I've been drinking [Endorush](http://energy-drink-ratings.blogspot.com/2007/05/endorush-fruit-punch-energy-drink.html) for a few weeks now.  The entire bottle is coated in a warning label trying to convince you to not chug it and instead spread it out through the day.  I spread it out over two days per bottle and it works fine.  Just be sure to keep in in the fridge between sips because it does spoil after opening otherwise.  I can't drink coffee or tea because the caffeine gives me stomach acid problems (I've even tried brewing several green teas), but I've had no problems with this stuff.  Tastes fine too."

"Neil Gaiman, at the Edinburgh Book Festival. It was pouring, and some of us were waiting in the rain for about two hours to get his autograph. I asked him how he was and he told me how sorry he felt for everyone outside. I told him they were in Edinburgh; they could hardly be surprised if it rained."
No Nintendo games. They are in a league of their own. Frankly I recommend them all :p
"I haven't really come across any one specific source that stands out or anything.  So here's a few different things I've been looking at, in random order:

* search ""javascript for php developers""... there's a video series, a book, and various web pages on the subject.  I downloaded the videos and have watched about half.  Very useful as it jumps right into the fundamental differences for things like: scope, async, object inheritance vs classes.   As a PHP dev, I always assumed I could just start writing JS seeing the syntax in mostly the same.  But these differences are mostly where all my frustrations have been in hating JS over the last 18 years.  Taking the time to learn this stuff properly is the first step to becoming as comfortable with JS as we were in PHP.
* It also doesn't hurt to go through some basic beginners videos for JS.  You can always skip the sections that are obvious to you.  I apply this to anything really.  Been running linux/unix servers for 20 years, but I still pick up plenty of tips in places like /r/linux4noobs etc
* There's quite a lot of video courses you can torrent
* Lots on YouTube too
* When it comes to specific frameworks like React, if they have a beginners guide, take the time to do it.  For React it guides you on building a little tic-tac-toe game: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html - didn't take very long to do, so it's worthwhile.  Same goes for any other frameworks/packages etc you're going to use... if they have a beginners guide, go through all of it.  It will probably save you time in the long run, especially if you try to build something straight away based on misconceptions of how to use the package.
* One thing I've found really difficult compared to PHP, is that a heap of these JS libraries have really vague buzzword filled descriptions on npm.  I wish I had a tip here for deciphering wtf they mean, but I don't.  Anybody got any tips here?"
Pacman dropped a real project?! Listening now.
"**On Open Access Repositories:**

I've seen this on Reddit before, and it's not a bad idea, but I also feel it's largely impractical. Most researchers/university faculty are extremely busy and will have difficulty getting back to you. The more popular the article, the more difficult it becomes to respond to requests. I've seen some suggestions for looking at open repositories, and depending on your research field, you might have varying success.

[https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/) was one of the first open repositories and remains a great place to look for physics (and more) related pre-print (after peer review, before copy editing) articles.

[https://www.biorxiv.org/](https://www.biorxiv.org/) is a biology focused pre-print repository.

Any research funded by the NIH is required to be posted on PubMed Central ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)), typically after a relatively short embargo period.

MLA Commons ([https://mla.hcommons.org/](https://mla.hcommons.org/)) can be a good source of humanities related Open Access materials.

[https://socopen.org/](https://socopen.org/) is an open repository for sociology paper.

Many universities also maintain institutional repositories that publish pre-print version of works.

Google Scholar will generally find every link to a particular article, including pre-print versions on open access repositories, so it's a very valuable tool for research. If Google Scholar takes you to a pay walled version of the article, go back check out some of the other results and see if there's a link to pre-print.

There are many more open repositories out there for various fields, unfortunately they're not always easy to find. A librarian may be able to assist you. All the above repositories are legal options and are generally copyright compliant.

&#x200B;

**About researchers:**

It's important to point out that researchers have a role to play here as well. It's researchers that are choosing to publish their works in journals that are behind pay walls. There are compelling reasons to do this. Getting published in a well known, high impact journal goes a long way to helping you get tenure and those journals tend to be well established non-open access journals. Even a researcher who believes strongly in disseminating knowledge widely for the betterment of humanity will have a hard time ignoring career considerations. No researcher would turn down an opportunity to get published in Nature for example. (It should be noted that Nature does allow for some limited open access publishing).

&#x200B;

**If you're a researcher, what can you do to help make your research more widely available?**

First, check what kind of open access publishing rights are associated with your journal of choice on SHERPA/RoMEO ([http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php)). [For example](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php?jtitle=nature&issn=0028-0836&zetocpub=Nature+Publishing+Group&romeopub=Nature+Publishing+Group&fIDnum=|&mode=simple&la=en&version=&source=journal&sourceid=4008), we can see that Nature allows the posting of a pre-print to some of the above mentioned repositories, as well as institutional repositories. Remember though, SHERPA/RoMEO is not authoritative and you should always check your publishing agreement.

Second, negotiate your publishing agreement (often called a ""Copyright Transfer Agreement"") with your publisher. These are not written in stone. Many university libraries have a Scholarly Communications departments or teams who may be able to offer you guidance on that. Even if a publishers insists on taking over the copyright, you should be able to negotiate to retain the right to publish your pre-print on an institutional or subject matter repository. Remember, if you sign your rights away, they're gone. Just because you wrote it doesn't mean you can do what you like with it. If you're not comfortable negotiating with a publisher, [SPARC ](https://sparcopen.org/)has an [addendum ](https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights/)you can use to modify a publisher agreement to be more in your favor.

Seconded. I get comments on it all the time.
"PS https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/nnn-design-considerations and take a call if `nnn` suits your workflow and requirements.
> copy, move, delete files is took much time compare to finder

Update: `nnn` has keys to copy, paste and move now.

I don't think so. The `nnn` way is to copy the file paths, press `!` and run `rm (ncp) -rvf` (refer to the readme for _ncp_). So you are pressing an extra `!`. The reasons why we prefer this is in the link above.

> but why would we have to do that instead just have a binding to remove the files, like cd xx && rm file?

Exactly! You can do it of your own volition. `nnn` supports as many scripts as you need.

> I want config NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER for Osx, what should I fill in

Set it to whatever is your default file manager in OS X. But if you _really_ want to go with it, just try `nnn` solo for a day or two."
Good lord that's alot of data in that report.

"Yep.  

Although keep in mind that there wouldn’t have been a conversation at all about Texas if Santa Ana hadn’t signed it over to escape imprisonment/execution. 

A lot of Santa Ana’s contemporaries (in their private papers) considered it an act of selfish cowardice, and resented him for it.

Me? “Gimme yer country or yer life, pal.” I’m like: “Sure.  Where do I sign?”

But Mexico back then was a very different culture.  The cultural expectation was for Santa Ana to say he’d never sign away Texas and take whatever execution or torture was in store for him. 

I often wondered what would have happened if Santa Ana had been martyred as a Mexican hero, instead of agreeing to an independent Texas."
"The water on nemesis is still dyed red, you were just in the off season, and it was a real shame that the 2005 plans fell through, as Alton towers alternate between family rides and rollercoasters yearly I suppose there is hope for 2015. The smiler (SW7) is my favorite ride there, it's got that same short looping bursts that nemesis has with less G forces and is very intertwined with itself, making all of the loops and bends flow incredibly well.
Edit: [Video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UrqbWF9fJ8&feature=youtube_gdata_player) very little pov footage but a good idea of the track based clusterfuck."
