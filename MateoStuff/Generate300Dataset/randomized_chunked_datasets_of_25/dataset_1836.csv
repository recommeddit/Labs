12866,"No one will see this or care but I felt like saying it anyways:

My mom cut out several years ago and shes long given up trying to have a relationship with me. Being the only girl out of 6 children, my dad didn't really know what to do with me at the time, a brass 14 year old with a short temper.  But he sat there through every dramatic break up, hair-brained scheme, and vain attempt at normality I've endured.  

I always call my dad on Mother's Day to thank him for being the best mom he could be for me.  I often take 20 mins out of my day and reflect on our time together, trade a few jokes, or share a teary eyed remark.  While he still may not fully understand the inner workings of my brain, he certainly tries.  He helped pick out my prom dress, offers dating advice, and never judges me for bad decisions.

Acknowledge your ""mom"" on Mother's Day.  Doesn't matter how poor your are, you can still afford a heartfelt conversation with that person.",best gifts for mom

69930,"Actor here and . . . yeah, he is pretty much right. My wife (also an acting major) runs a theatre education program for kids, and I travel around giving presentations to high schoolers, so we are both *kind of* in our field, but we're the lucky ones. Dozens of the other actors from my program went to New York and LA, some of them *very* talented, hard-working, attractive, everything you could hope for. None of them are making a living acting, not a single one, and most of them are working in the service industry.

*However*, I am convinced that Acting is perhaps the single best major for learning people skills. Nobody really hires exclusively for that, they want an expert in one area who also happens to already be a people person, but perhaps a double major would work out well?",best major to study in college
