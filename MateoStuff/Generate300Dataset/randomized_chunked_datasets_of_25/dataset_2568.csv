6190,best Netflix documentary,"God Knows Where I Am - I found it fascinating. The description reads, ""Linda lived on apples and rain until she died in an old New Hampshire farmhouse. The mental health system failed her."""

9208,best toothpaste,your breath must be terrible
65390,best phone service company,"I honestly have nothing bad to say about Verizon.  They are a pretty solid company,  and,  outside of my time in Alaska,  I got really good reception on their service.  I've had them,  off and on,  for more than 10 years. They provide extremely good customer service.

I even had their service for the 2 years that I had Xfinity mobile, with great service then as well. 

I take issue with the price of service,  but, when you're living in the US, you pay way more than you should for that privilege anyway..."
34822,best NFL player,Goes to show how absolutely insane the dude is.
43942,best items under $100,A PS2 and accompanying Ace Combat games. Ohohoh yes.
47883,best color to paint with,"A very underrated colour.  The amount of times I suggest grey and people turn their nose up just because grey is associated with being boring.  It looks very good in offices and in domestic settings, is calming, and provides a perfect background for something in front of it, such as art placed on the wall or a plant next to it."
46998,best hand santizer brand,Hydrogen peroxide at what strength?
2100,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"Honestly, maybe controversial opinion here, but I think pizza is lacking in IV. Pizza my Heart/Woodstocks are solid but too expensive, and Blaze is p good but it's like $12 for a pizza. The Dominos is kinda ass imo. If I had to pick, I'd say Blaze is the best but it's pricy."
21670,best winnie the pooh comic,"Disney fuckin' ruined Pooh. The Pooh of A. A. Milne's books never would have said this shit. He was occasionally tactless, but not an ass."
51655,best iphone case,"I'm not going to purchase a case for day to day use. I'll get one the battery case for on travel.

I wanna hold the iPhone bareback! 😁"
46579,best trick or treating candy,OMG pretzel M&Ms are always the first off the shelves in Wisconsin it's a bitch to find them
44921,best items under $100,"If you haven't already, be sure to check out ergonomic keyboards. They provided me with a huge amount of relief it was almost instant. I really like the Microsoft sculpt keyboard and mouse."

8649,best toothpaste,Give it a few minutes.  I'll be a pariah in about an hour.
16984,best iOS game,No Polytopia??
54829,best water filter,"For your consideration: These are Clorox's recommended steps [from their FAQ](http://www.clorox.com/products/clorox-regular-bleach/faq/):

1. Remove suspended particles by filtering or letting particles settle to the bottom.

2. Pour off clear water into a clean container.

3. Add 8 drops of Clorox® Regular-Bleach (not scented or Clorox® Plus® bleaches) to one gallon of water (2 drops to 1 quart). For cloudy water, use 16 drops per gallon of water (4 drops to 1 quart).

4. Allow the treated water to stand for 30 minutes. Water should have a slight bleach odor. If not, repeat and wait another 15 minutes. The treated water can then be made palatable by pouring it between clean containers several times."
5477,best home improvement store,Menards is the GOAT for home improvement stuff. The stores are absolutely MASSIVE and have nearly everything. I'll never step foot in a Lowe's again
58326,best cologne,"Pi made me follow a stranger around the grocery store and actually ask him what he was wearing so I could buy it for my husband. 

I am extremely fond of it, so much so that it was personally awkward when a coworker that I didn't like much was wearing it. I had to take a half day and go jump my husband."
29653,best game console,"Ace Combat Zero, 4 and 5 were missed."
47960,best color to paint with,"Grey all day, with a trend toward warm grey, and away from cool grey."
36701,best alcoholic drink,"I've never had dark beer before, I'm curious to try!"
58557,best cologne,">Why is it that when you walk into a house where a great meal has been cooking, that wonderful smell of food... smells so awful on a human, outside of the context of food -- e.g. sitting next to someone who smells like bacon in a theater?

It's just your opinion that food smells bad.  This time of year I like my women to smell like candy canes.  I don't use deodorant because my pits smell like fried chicken.  I was blessed with ""chicken pits"".

This Razzbar fellow lies to try and demonize his opponents.  [I caught him in a lie right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/n2ub4/til_t_boone_pickens_purchased_8_miles_of_bare/c36rlvx).  Just watch your back, [if you point out the stupidity of one his statements](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/n2ub4/til_t_boone_pickens_purchased_8_miles_of_bare/c36fwky), he [deflects like crazy](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/n2ub4/til_t_boone_pickens_purchased_8_miles_of_bare/c36mkl2)."
