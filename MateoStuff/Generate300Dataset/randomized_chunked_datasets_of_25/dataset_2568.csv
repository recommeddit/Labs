65390,"I honestly have nothing bad to say about Verizon.  They are a pretty solid company,  and,  outside of my time in Alaska,  I got really good reception on their service.  I've had them,  off and on,  for more than 10 years. They provide extremely good customer service.

I even had their service for the 2 years that I had Xfinity mobile, with great service then as well. 

I take issue with the price of service,  but, when you're living in the US, you pay way more than you should for that privilege anyway...",best phone service company

It looks very good in offices and in domestic settings, is calming, and provides a perfect background for something in front of it, such as art placed on the wall or a plant next to it.",best color to paint with

The Dominos is kinda ass imo. If I had to pick, I'd say Blaze is the best but it's pricy.",best pizza place in Santa Barbara

54829,"For your consideration: These are Clorox's recommended steps [from their FAQ](http://www.clorox.com/products/clorox-regular-bleach/faq/):

1. Remove suspended particles by filtering or letting particles settle to the bottom.

2. Pour off clear water into a clean container.

3. Add 8 drops of Clorox® Regular-Bleach (not scented or Clorox® Plus® bleaches) to one gallon of water (2 drops to 1 quart). For cloudy water, use 16 drops per gallon of water (4 drops to 1 quart).

4. Allow the treated water to stand for 30 minutes. Water should have a slight bleach odor. If not, repeat and wait another 15 minutes. The treated water can then be made palatable by pouring it between clean containers several times.",best water filter

58557,">Why is it that when you walk into a house where a great meal has been cooking, that wonderful smell of food... smells so awful on a human, outside of the context of food -- e.g. sitting next to someone who smells like bacon in a theater?

It's just your opinion that food smells bad.  This time of year I like my women to smell like candy canes.  I don't use deodorant because my pits smell like fried chicken.  I was blessed with ""chicken pits"".
