10515,best suitcase lock,"It's fine to check your box as well. Just include a firearm in the box. 

If you're checking firearms, TSA requires that the box and contents be checked with you present, then locked up with a non-TSA lock. Basically a box with guns is about the only case where they'll care that your property won't be ""misplaced"" after it goes down the conveyor."

13727,best research paper archive,Can someone please summarize this without the math language?  I have not been in a math classroom for 10 years and the variables and equations are escaping me.  I've been googling all day and I dont' want to spend an hour trying to get a 2 sentence summary out of this.
34600,best NFL player,"The other thing to note however, is that Rice didn't have as much WR competition the way other HoF's had (Moss + Carter, Fitzgerald + Boldin, etc).

Every WR had a unique situation that affected their stats one way or another. For instance, Fitzgerald certainly didn't benefit from having an extremely low caliber of QBs for the majority of his career.

Do you have any articles about the worse QB equating to better stats for a WR? I'd love to know more about that!~"

59940,best perfume,"Outremer can be found for very little.  Great scents, some are even EDP's and extraits.  Most generally under 20US dollars.  Hard to find in stores (Anthropologie has a limited amount)

\+1 on Pacifica.  

Zum has some very interesting scents.   My favorite Myrrh and Frankincense

And while this did not start off life as a cheapy, Alfred Sung Shi, Pure, and Sung are generally very cheap.

Also, everyone should try SJP Covet.    Def. not your average celeb scent."
