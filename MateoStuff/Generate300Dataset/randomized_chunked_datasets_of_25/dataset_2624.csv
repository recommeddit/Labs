50832,"That's fair, and I really appreciate the explanation.

I'm intrigued by this idea that a great album has/ should have three great songs. I'll have to keep an ear out for that. Do you have any playlists where you have compiled the ""power trios"" of various albums?

Did you feel this strongly about the album on first listen? I personally find that many of my all time favourite albums have taken many play-throughs to work their way into my head and heart (this album included).

Are there any other records (other than TLET) that you feel are at this level?",best rap album

59927,"agreed regarding Pacifica. They have a mediterranean fig one that smells exactly like diptyque philosykos ... I used to wear it all the time. I was actually disappointed when I first smiled philosykos because I wanted It to be more complex... it's beautiful but ~~not worth buying when the Pacifica version is like $10 and the same~~ RIP it was discontinued :'((((

30171,"You had “social studies” in elementary school, which talks a little bit about history in general.  But it’s not extensive.  It teaches a little bit of geography.  For history, elementary kids learn mostly just hits, like the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, Columbus, the American Revolution, and the Civil War.  Maybe a little about the 20th Century stuff like WWI and WWII - but not much.

Starting in middle school, you start having more directed and extensive studies. In 7th Grade, you take Texas History. In 8th Grade, American History to 1877.  In 9th Grade, American History 1877 to present. In 11th Grade, you take World History.  

In your senior year, you would take Government (Civics) instead of a history class. 

And of course, there were a few honors history courses available to some students if they wanted it. 

But yes: we learned Texas History before we learned US History.",best Mexican war to study

16053,"I've got a couple of pairs that I've collected over the last six years or so... I have a very very small head and most adult sunglasses are too big for me (they look too big but also don't stay on my face). 
I used to prefer cat eye shapes and wore a $100 dupe of the Ellery x Graz sunnies for a few years because I could never bite the bullet on the $330 price tag.
Then I moved to round frames, I bought the Porto style from Bespecd for about $80 that were my go-to the last two summers.
More recently I wanted to take my sunglasses game to the next level, I found the [M6 model of Kuboraum x Julius](https://dt66ikht21gkc.cloudfront.net/img/imgocchiali/358/img_art_JULIUS_MASK_M6_MATTE_BLACK_BURNT_BM_BT_A.jpg)  and fell in love with how quirky they were (and they fit my face!). At $550-ish depending on the retailer I just couldn't do it even though I was prepared to invest more this time around. However my gorgeous boyfriend remembered them when I mentioned them about 6 months ago and got them for me for my birthday. I absolutely love them so much. They're so unusual that they circumvent style trends, so I'd say these are my sunnies for the long term now. If I ever got another pair it'd be to add to the collection rather than replace.",best sunglasses for fashion
