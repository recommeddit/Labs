63297,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Evendev is developing another package manger name: Lime, Its awesome when developer is concern about it"
7341,best laptop for general use,"I am definitely eyeing that gateway one! 
I haven’t had a laptop or computer in years, so brand recognition doesn’t mean much to me at this time. 
I really appreciate your feedback and list! Thanks so much! ☺️"
50832,best rap album,"That's fair, and I really appreciate the explanation.

I'm intrigued by this idea that a great album has/ should have three great songs. I'll have to keep an ear out for that. Do you have any playlists where you have compiled the ""power trios"" of various albums?

Did you feel this strongly about the album on first listen? I personally find that many of my all time favourite albums have taken many play-throughs to work their way into my head and heart (this album included).

Are there any other records (other than TLET) that you feel are at this level?"
46374,best trick or treating candy,"I'm surprised I didn't see this yet, but keep track of how many kids!

We keep a pad of paper and after they left add the number.  That way next year you have a better idea how much candy to buy.

We've had 65-80 kids every year for the last 5 years.  It's very neighborhood dependent though..."
59927,best perfume,"agreed regarding Pacifica. They have a mediterranean fig one that smells exactly like diptyque philosykos ... I used to wear it all the time. I was actually disappointed when I first smiled philosykos because I wanted It to be more complex... it's beautiful but ~~not worth buying when the Pacifica version is like $10 and the same~~ RIP it was discontinued :'((((

Edit: :((((("
53665,best medicine for a cold,"Acetaminophen and ibuprofen do not cause constipation. Too much acetaminophen is very bad for the liver, and ibuprofen can cause GI upset, even ulcers, and heart/kidney issues over time."
17144,best iOS game,Couple of heavy weights. Curious to know if you play on iPhone or iPad for these?
39744,best Chrome extensions,"Honestly, if I walked by a subordinate's desk and saw something that looked like Geocities or an old hacker bbs from the 90s, I'd be ten-times more concerned. 

""Is this guy reading the anarchist's cookbook or some shit?"""

58903,best perfume,Jicky is def goated.
59512,best perfume,"Interesting, I was thinking 35-40. Great cohesive taste imo, I feel like you get a good somewhat equal wearing out of most of your favs. Always been in a small town? I feel like in your youth perhaps not, maybe not big city but perhaps a more busier area than currently."
30171,best Mexican war to study,"You had “social studies” in elementary school, which talks a little bit about history in general.  But it’s not extensive.  It teaches a little bit of geography.  For history, elementary kids learn mostly just hits, like the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, Columbus, the American Revolution, and the Civil War.  Maybe a little about the 20th Century stuff like WWI and WWII - but not much.

Starting in middle school, you start having more directed and extensive studies. In 7th Grade, you take Texas History. In 8th Grade, American History to 1877.  In 9th Grade, American History 1877 to present. In 11th Grade, you take World History.  

In your senior year, you would take Government (Civics) instead of a history class. 

And of course, there were a few honors history courses available to some students if they wanted it. 

But yes: we learned Texas History before we learned US History."
48362,best color to paint with,It really depends on the tone of your flooring/features. I prefer Benajamin Moore white’s but use a different white for different spaces.
59912,best perfume,Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan.
61862,Best RPG game on PS4,"> nowadays

Stopped reading there. ARPGs have **always** been considered RPGs by everyone. The idea that RPG = turn-based is both sickening and extremely new."
58047,best cologne,Was just about to come here to say this. I feel like I live on r/Fragrance some days 😂
47514,best state to visit in the United States,"Marco Island, Florida"
23714,best car racing video game,"I always chose the white car, simply because of fuel efficiency. While everyone was off running into things and having to hit the pit-stop every lap, I could sometimes go two without having to stop. It seriously helped me win quite a few races."
46674,best hand santizer brand,I always go through there and never have seen it. I'll look extra close next time. thank you for sharing!
33373,best electric car,"I bought my e-Golf today for $20k.

There were near brand new leafs for $18K but I believe in CCS charging infrastructure to be more abundant than Chademo.

Plenty of older leafs with 40-70 miles of range ranging from 5-11k. You can also upgrade a leaf [with this company ](https://evridesllc.com/battery-upgrade-service/) and upgrade your range to 110 miles of range for $4500"
60955,Best comedy show on Netflix,Archer is honestly the greatest show period.
16053,best sunglasses for fashion,"I've got a couple of pairs that I've collected over the last six years or so... I have a very very small head and most adult sunglasses are too big for me (they look too big but also don't stay on my face). 
I used to prefer cat eye shapes and wore a $100 dupe of the Ellery x Graz sunnies for a few years because I could never bite the bullet on the $330 price tag.
Then I moved to round frames, I bought the Porto style from Bespecd for about $80 that were my go-to the last two summers.
More recently I wanted to take my sunglasses game to the next level, I found the [M6 model of Kuboraum x Julius](https://dt66ikht21gkc.cloudfront.net/img/imgocchiali/358/img_art_JULIUS_MASK_M6_MATTE_BLACK_BURNT_BM_BT_A.jpg)  and fell in love with how quirky they were (and they fit my face!). At $550-ish depending on the retailer I just couldn't do it even though I was prepared to invest more this time around. However my gorgeous boyfriend remembered them when I mentioned them about 6 months ago and got them for me for my birthday. I absolutely love them so much. They're so unusual that they circumvent style trends, so I'd say these are my sunnies for the long term now. If I ever got another pair it'd be to add to the collection rather than replace."
19477,best YouTube video,"Yep. I binged watched all of TierZoo's videos. Then, in biology class when we were learning about evolution, I couldn't stop thinking about the concept of organisms just spending their evolution points."
73402,best battery bank,"FWIW, Amazon Gold Box on Anker today, including 10000 and 20000 power banks."
