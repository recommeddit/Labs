"Probably not. The crazy religious lady, Mrs. Carmody was right most of the time. When the mist descends on the town, she predicts that someone will die that night and she's right. The monsters break in that night, one lands on Carmody while she's praying and spares her then moves on to kill the cashier. When Amanda slaps her the first time, she says ""If you hit me again, if you dare, you'll be on your knees to me before this is through."" Later, when Amanda slaps her again, Carmody's followers force Amanda to her knees. And finally, at the climax of the movie, Carmody claims that God wants them to sacrifice David's son and they'll be saved and what happened? David killed his son and the mist immediately disappears and the army rolls in to save the day."
"There was this radio/tv show in Norway that went to a hotel for a night and took apart all the furniture, like taking out the screws and lining them all over the room.

The rest of this story is that a while after, the same guys calls the hotel and asks if they can stay at it another night. The staff says sure, and when they come, the staff has taken the room apart just as they had done earlier."

Agreed. People ask me if they're actually good or just trendy. They are amazing. So comfortable and durable.
Ye boi. He made a really good decision with changing his channel name and direction.
"Definitely.  There are cerebral movies I adore, but I would never pass up watching any on this list—I have watched many of these over and over."

"Weird. I just wanted cold and flus, they don’t have pseudoefedrine in Aus anymore, so none of that.  But in NL they had just paracetamol. NOTHING to stop my runny nose"
"Rear Window is great! I love how much that movie makes you feel like you're right there with Jimmy Stewart and the others in his apartment, wondering what's going on."

"Oh yeah. There are five resorts in the property and whichever one you choose gives you access to that one and all of the ones that are cheaper. The palace deluxe is the most expensive. We pay for the top shelf liquor package, then take $100 in cash. Most or all of the staff live in a dormitory in the property so you see a lot of them almost every day.  I give a $20 bill to a waitress every day and can barely drunk fast enough to keep up with the refills. But that is just to buy top shelf service. You don’t have to spend a penny at the resort if you don’t want to. 

I think the excursions are extra, FYI. But when I go, I don’t do anything but lay around or play golf. So I’m not certain about all of the excursions. 

We went to a sandals resort in St. Lucia for our honeymoon and it was underwhelming. We paid for butler service, which was nice, but not worth it. And the rest of the resort was just okay. Younger crowd in Mexico for sure."
"I play with 3 players and a scenario usually takes around 2 hours, but some of them have been quite a bit shorter."
Until you pick up a distillery-only bottle of Scotch and suddenly need to check a bag for your return flight.

"Haha this is true. The most beautiful oboe player can be ruined by another less-stellar oboe player. 

To be fair, double reed instruments are very difficult, intonation-wise."
"Geyser is a word derived from the name of a famous icelandic geyser, Geysir."
"One of the translucent cases from Amazon. I wanna show off my green phone, but also hate fingerprints and oily cases. Translucent case doesn't really show either, but still see-thru enough to show off color."
