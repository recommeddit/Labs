32371,I can relate. Last century I was sitting in a hospital waiting room in London waiting to get my travel shots. They were running behind so I started talking the old guy next to me. I was headed to Egypt. He drew a map and started telling me all the best places to check out over there. We spoke for half an hour before he was called in for his shots. When he left the nurse came over and said do you realise you've been talking to Richard Harris? I had seen most of his movies but had no idea. He was a really nice friendly guy.,best hotel to live in
23774,"I’ve only played driveclub, but I’ve played the older forzas, just not this generation. Same with gran turismo. Only last gen. Anyways driveclub is a really good racing game. Some of it is a bit tougher honestly than what I was used to, I had trouble being consistent with most vehicles but I felt like I was getting better. The picture mode in driveclub is amazing. The weather makes the game very difficult. The glare you can get from the sun, the rain makes it slick af, coming out of tunnels is very hard to do with the sun in our eyes.... It really adds a lot to the game.",best car racing video game

30372,"Amazing guy, around one kill an hour of day light, for 100 days, they called in artillery strikes to try and kill him, one man!

The Winter War is also where Molotov Cocktails come from - Molotov had radio broadcasts saying they were dropping food aid to the Finns, to get them to come outside, and then dropped bombs, so in return, the Finns dropped ""Molotov Cocktails"" down the exhaust pipes of tanks... (to do this, they'd dress all in white, ski up, drop and ski away, often before being seen)...

You are right to be scared of Finns...",best Mexican war to study

https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser/releases

Basically, the opposite of basic.  

Tons of options, customization, extensions, information about the way your browser interacts with the Internet and vice-versa, and so on and so forth (They also try to get rid of as much proprietary telemetry as they can, so it's more private and more open-source than a lot of browsers out there. I am not saying than every browser out there, but a lot of them.).

It's one of the only browsers, maybe the only browser out there, that really lets you use the screen space and power of a modern phone the way you would use a computer.

Most Android browsers give you very few choices and really make everyone's web experience one thing.  Iceraven lets you make your phone your own.

Heck, if you really get into it and want to code a little, it's sort of a shoestring all volunteer project, so they accept patches and pull requests from the public and if you're good at it, they could actually use some more regular maintainers/developers, too, to help the main guy out (It doesn't pay, but its a way to get into developing a web browser pretty quick if you catch on.).

For desktop, I use Vivaldi these days, which also has a lot of options (They have an Android version, too, but it's not as good as Iceraven for Android or Vivaldi for desktop IMO.  Vivaldi for Android don't provide the options I'd expect from Vivaldi or any extensions on Android- yet, anyway.).  If you don't need sync, Iceraven on your phone and Vivaldi on your desktop work great- I'm not a sync guy and those are my defaults.  If you do need (or want) sync, though, Iceraven for Android is definitely capable of syncing with Firefox for desktop and probably (but not definitely) Waterfox for desktop, so you could explore an Iceraven for Android and Firefox (or Waterfox) for desktop combo if you need sync.

And, of course, you know, trying a new web browser out is free except for the value of your time, so if you want to try several browsers and see which ones you like, there's not really any reason not to.  I guess if you focus on one and try to learn it, you'll learn quicker and get less frustrated than if you try a bunch at once and have to try to figure them all out at once- so maybe it depends on your temperament.

I definitely think you are on the right track with going beyond Chrome.  I'm not saying that Chrome isn't the right browser for some people (Everything is the right browser for someone), I'm just saying you don't know if you haven't ever tried anything else.  If you don't like the other stuff as much, you can always go back.

What amazes me is that Chrome for Android won't even offer an ad-blocker, content-blocker, or extensions of any kind, whereas Iceraven has UBlock Origin and a bunch of other favorites you may know from Chrome for desktop that they won't let you use on Chrome for Android.  Google doesn't bother to try to make Chrome for Android competitive by allowing stuff like that because they don't have to- people just use it because it comes with their phones

**TL; DR**: Iceraven for Android, Vivaldi for Windows.",best web browser
12527,"My mom once saw a Tom Ford lipstick in a magazine and loved the shade (she is very specific about the shade of red lipstick she likes to wear), but it’s really hard to find stores that sells Tom Ford makeup products in the country she lives. She also hates buying things online. So I went to a store close to my university and bought the lipstick she wanted. 

She’s worn it everyday since :)",best gifts for mom
