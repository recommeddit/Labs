32594,"I've only been to one all inclusive resort and coincidentally it was for an october honeymoon. We went to the Sandals St. Lucia Regency (I think that was the name of it, it's the biggest of the three on St. Lucia). We had an incredible time there. From the second we got there till we left, we really felt like a welcomed guest. It's really cool that you can leave your wallet locked in your room for a week and never think twice about it. Beautiful grounds, great staff, delicious food, great activities to do. Even the spa where we got a couples massage was fantastic. Like I said, my experience is very limited but if you're looking for recommendations, we loved it. Another cool thing was that you had full access to all three resorts on the island. Just hop on the shuttle, and when you get there everything is available to you. No check in process or anything. Just step off the shuttle and pony up to the bar. Pretty neat. Anyways, that's my two cents. Congratulations OP and I hope you have a great time wherever you end up.",best vacation resort

68213,"This is a great challenge. Top 5? Damn.

* Dune \- Frank Herbert. A master class in intrigue, action, and world building. Plus, sand worm riding.
* Neuromancer \- Gibson. Still the most compelling near\-future dystopian setting. Set the bar for hacking and cyberpunk aesthetics.
* Rendezvous with Rama \- Arthur C. Clarke. Grand vision, still the most compelling first contact, sense\-of\-wonder setting.
* Lord of Light \- Zelazny. Yeah, it's sci\-fi through and though.
* When the dream dies \- A. Bertram Chandler. No objective value, but my first contact with large scale sci\-fi, after Asimov. Great adventure stories.

I have to say, at some point I just went for the books I remember most fondly, because the list here is long. I'd probably have trouble sorting through my top 50, let alone 5...",best science fiction novel

The service there is top notch, great food on site at the resort, one of the top rated spas, salt water pools on the balcony of each room, just a 5 minute walk into town. I can't wait to go back, I highly recommend it. Came across it on TripAdvisor.com.",best vacation resort
25390,"Australia by a mile. Bradman is a cheat code himself, and with Gilchrist providing an extra boost at the wicketkeeper batsman I don't see any other team coming close. 

For the all rounder spot, I would pick Keith Miller (bat avg 37, bowling avg 23), or Steve Waugh(over 10k test runs at 50+ average) if you want to make the strongest batting lineup. Waugh can do the 5th bowler job easily when you have 4 great frontline bowlers. If you want to go with 5 proper bowlers, choose Keith.",best cricket teams of all time
