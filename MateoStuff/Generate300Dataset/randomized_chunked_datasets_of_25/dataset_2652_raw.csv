Oh no I don’t mind at all! I’m currently replaying crystal for the first time in many years and the nostalgia is amazing! I could do it over and over again! I’m also interested in trying the newer stuff too so thank you for the suggestions!
Just legally transport a firearm in your checked baggage. There are pretty strict laws about who can unlock your baggage if you have properly declared a firearm.
True. But for general use??? no way
"Yes, 100%! It just makes it so much easier to talk about fragrances. Like, if you enjoy tuberose especially, Fracas is a touchstone - knowing it makes it easier to communicate what other tuberose fragrances are like."
"> In a list of all-time greats, you need to compare players to their contemporaries, otherwise you just end up with the top 100 players from the last 20 years.

The older I get the more I realize just how susceptible sports is to recency bias. I mean I get it, very few people are going to read books on players from a bygone era or watch old games outside of the occasional highlight reel."

"Cats are not assholes- Im sorry you had a bad experience with a cat or two but cats are generally quite affectionate... and rabbits are not a great suggestion for kids. They stink, poop constantly, and are not very cuddly, plus they chew EVERYTHING and are very destructive unless they have an area set up properly for them."
"I don't think a lot of people realize this, but Mexico. Specifically, in or near the Puerto Vallarta area. Everyone speaks English, everyone is incredibly nice and courteous, and nobody cares about your past. People are very generous, and whenever I'm down there, almost every night at least five or six different people will invite me to have dinner with them, even when I know for a fact they are fucking poor. You can make good money doing construction, and its near the beach. In that area, Mexico is legitmately a paradise."
"One of everything in these comments.

And don't forget a good margarita."
Quacks is the best!

Regis ALWAYS makes these lists. ALWAYS.
Same.
My dad worked in local politics and I met Bill Clinton once.  You know how you can feel someone’s presence when they walk into a room?  That’s exactly how it was with him.  Dude is the most charismatic man in the planet and charisma just radiates off him.  He can talk to anyone and make them feel like they’ve been friends forever.  He also has a great way of talking “at your level” if that makes sense.  Like a neighbor and not like a big shot or politician.
