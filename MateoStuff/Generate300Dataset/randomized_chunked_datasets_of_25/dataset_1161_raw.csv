"Here is my take on it as someone who is also starting out. You should focus on audio more than a webcam. 

If you can't afford a webcam I would just wait till you can afford a better one that you won't need to think about upgrading later. 

Most streamers are moving to DSLR based facecams. That would be an upgrade path of 3 devices if you want to start at that level. Now you might be able to utilize more than one for different camera angles. 

The way I see it as someone else mentioned if you don't think you will want to get a better quality one and see it as more of a hobby then go for the cheaper one up front. 

If you think you will want to upgrade and won't use a two camera setup, then just wait till you can afford the better one. I streamed a few months without one and focused on audio instead until I could afford and wanted to make the jump to a c920."

"It's slippery, but that's good for jean pockets, in my opinion. Although I don't feel it slipping out of my hands if that's what you meant. It's definitely not as slippery as the caseless iphone though."

"I see. There has been new laptops released since I've made this list, and the [**HP Envy x360 15""**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-15-ds1097nr) is one of them. It has an 8-core Ryzen 7 processor, 16 GB RAM, and a 256 GB SSD. It should be great for your uses. If you want something more reliable / has better build quality, I'd go with the Lenovo ThinkPad E595 on my list."
CO alarm not CO2. CO2 you gonna notice it when you are awake you gonna cough and all that but CO you don't notice it till its too late
"There’s no right answer here. They will both have certain things the other doesn’t, and both will have better prices on certain items. You’ll just have to go back and forth a little. I never have settled on one. For me, HD has better painting supplies (not actual paint!!! Don’t buy paint at hardware store). HD has better lighting options. Lowe’s typically has better lawn equipment and prices on outdoor equipment. As far as customer service goes, it’s a crapshoot depending on store locations. Overall Lowe’s is usually better customer service in my experience. But it really just depends on location."
"I think it is worth it. I did my undergrad at a standard university that cost a ton of money. Even there I didn’t have really any networking opportunity, because I was locked out of those career growth things because of a low GPA. I’ve been in the work force for over 15 years, and wanted to get a grad degree in a better paying field, but I just wasn’t willing to pay the insane tuition costs, work on anyone else’s schedule, and sit through traditional classes. I work full time, commute 10 hours a week, and have a disability. Traditional education was not an option. A close friend recommended WGU, and I chose it as best for my needs. It isn’t easy, you have to be self-motivated, manage your time well, test well, write well to pass the classes. At the same time, they tell you exactly what they are looking for to prove competency on essays. They take out the bullshit of course work. I don’t think much about the networking stuff. I know there are groups that meet online within degree programs and within classes, you’re assigned a mentor, and there are course instructors. I believe they can help you network around. That said there are many ways to network, friends, family, colleagues, former employers, volunteer supervisors, meet up groups, church functions, LinkedIn, etc. My friend who recommended WGU to me never had a problem getting interviews or jobs with her degree, and I don’t expect to have an issue either. WGU now has several satellite affiliates and they are growing, companies offer tuition reimbursement for their programs, and they take industry standards seriously when determining competency. I understand your nervousness, I was also, and then I decided I just needed to do it so I could get a better paying job. It was the only real option for me. I can’t say that all is well yet because I haven’t graduated, but I fully expect to double my income once I graduate."

"I just see 1. all the way down instead of an increasing list. I'll double check that it's not just baconreader.

Edit: Shows that way on Reddit. I think it's the extra text making it think they're all separate lists rather than formatting as a single list."
Idk man 4 had some fuckin great gameplay.

"It’s my favorite film of all time, best action, writing and possibly best villain (only competition would be Willem Dafoe). Also Aunt May in this one had purpose, she was Peter’s yoda, she provided him with wisdom and encouragement and she was a very human character. That “I believe there’s a hero in all of us” speech she gave is one of the dopest movie speeches ever. In Homecoming she just made shitty larb jokes and everyone wanted to hang her. You never see them sad about uncle Ben, and she’s just kinda... there..."

Dark Souls/Bloodborne are great if you're up for an intense challenge. 

Fallout/Skyrim/Oblivion are all great too."
"In most cases due to the screwed up nature of scientific publishing these days (screwed up meaning useful science is put behind commercial paywalls instead of being provided with free access for all, on a subsidized basis if necessary) these two conditions you suggest are mutually exclusive."
