7443,best laptop for general use,"Hi, unfortunately, powerful devices with touchscreens are very rare. I would go for the Acer Swift X on my list. It offers a solid balance between performance and battery life, which is rare for the price point."

62450,Best RPG game on PS4,"The FF games from PS1-2 (FF7, 8, 9, 10, 12) were all turn-based. 11 and 14 are MMO's. 

15 has more of an active, action-rpg style combat, which some old-school FF fans didn't enjoy as much. I thought it was really good though. Take a look at both - you may enjoy the old-school style ones though; PS4 has a bunch of them remastered."
49051,best gaming monitor,"Yea, I've seen stock coming back slowly. I got mine about 3 weeks ago and the only ones one amazon were $300 more than ordering direct from LG."

28910,best breakfast foods,"Egg cups. I make a dozen at a time (2 per serving). Mix up 12 eggs and throw in spices (a little seasoning salt, Italian Seasoning, onion powder for me). Spray a muffin tin. Put in spinach or whatever veggies you have on hand. Pour in the egg mixture on top. Sprinkle with cheese (I use feta). Cook @ 350 for 25 minutes. Keep in the fridge and microwave before you hit the road each day. Enjoy!"

46689,best hand santizer brand,The only hand sanitizer I ever see at the store is made by a local distillery-- and it's sold in small bottles that are priced like it's French perfume.
9663,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I respect your opinion, and cannot argue as to the health side of the issue.  However, with that said, please do not take offense if I choose never to eat at your house!"
55257,best places to hike in the east coast,"I have a moderately challenging suggestion. The Sipsey Wilderness in Bankhead National Forest. Located in northwest Alabama is is a very old growth forest and absolutely beautiful. The Sipsey river runs through the forest and is feed by a variety of large creeks and streams that must sometimes be traversed. There are boulder fields and large cliff faces. The terrain is moderately challenging, although can be very flat near the rivers. The trails will require map skills and the wilderness area will put to the test your basic outdoorsman skills. However, the area is completely secluded and you can completely escape civilization and man. One of my favorite backpacking destinations. I recommend the Thompson trailhead!"

70307,best major to study in college,Ah I’ve accepted my place :) I’m heading to grad school for biophysics. Still super cool stuff I can do with that! Plus I’m not super advanced with math either. I can deal with modest quantum theory stuff but being an actual astrophysicist would probably break my brain

46020,best trick or treating candy,"When I first tried those sweets, I gushed about them to anyone who would listen, they tick all of my boxes AND have a pretty decent list of ingredients. One of the best candy out there! This guide has no business insulting them! 

I am not too worked up about hard candy, I promise."
