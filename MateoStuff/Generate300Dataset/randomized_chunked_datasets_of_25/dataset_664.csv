62450,"The FF games from PS1-2 (FF7, 8, 9, 10, 12) were all turn-based. 11 and 14 are MMO's. 

15 has more of an active, action-rpg style combat, which some old-school FF fans didn't enjoy as much. I thought it was really good though. Take a look at both - you may enjoy the old-school style ones though; PS4 has a bunch of them remastered.",Best RPG game on PS4

55257,"I have a moderately challenging suggestion. The Sipsey Wilderness in Bankhead National Forest. Located in northwest Alabama is is a very old growth forest and absolutely beautiful. The Sipsey river runs through the forest and is feed by a variety of large creeks and streams that must sometimes be traversed. There are boulder fields and large cliff faces. The terrain is moderately challenging, although can be very flat near the rivers. The trails will require map skills and the wilderness area will put to the test your basic outdoorsman skills. However, the area is completely secluded and you can completely escape civilization and man. One of my favorite backpacking destinations. I recommend the Thompson trailhead!",best places to hike in the east coast
