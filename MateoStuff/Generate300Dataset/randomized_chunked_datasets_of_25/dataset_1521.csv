Kim - I really respect the career/empire she has built over the years and she‚Äôs definitely a smart woman. That time where she slut-shamed Bella Thorne (I think that‚Äôs who Scott flew out to Dubai on the family vacation?) put a really bad taste in my mouth, even if it was just for the show. 

Kourtney - Her style, her passion for being a mother and living a clean and healthy lifestyle is really inspiring to me. She can be hypocritical when it comes to coparenting with Scott and seems like she lacks self awareness when it comes to her own faults and mistakes. 

Khloe - She‚Äôs hilarious, probably the most genuine out of everyone and you can tell she truly puts her family first, which I admire. I think she definitely has some anger issues and she‚Äôs always quick to yell/swear/snap at someone for saying something she doesn‚Äôt agree with, plus the whole Tristan/Jordyn situation where she was definitely taking advantage of being the victim and making people feel sorry for her. 

Kendall - Something about Kendall I really love and I know most people won‚Äôt agree but I find her to be one of the most interesting sisters? Her style has been kinda whack recently but she‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous. I really hate that she got work done on her face and lied about it but I guess they‚Äôve all done it at this point. 

Kylie - I lowkey am obsessed with Kylie to the point where my entire explore page on instagram is pretty much her. I LOVE that she seems genuinely happy with her little family that I remember her saying in a Teen Vogue interview that she wanted to accomplish by 2025, and that she seems to be keeping her life a lot more private nowadays which I think is so much better for her mental health. I only really dislike how over the years she‚Äôs lost so much of her personality due to the fear of being judged and hated on, like girl BE YOURSELF WE LOVE YOU!!!",best Kardashian

9197,"I actually went 15 years without seeing a dentist, and only had one small faint cavity when I did finally see a dentist. 

Here's what I did: 

1) Floss 2 to 3 times per day. (Keep a bottle of floss at my desk, in the shower, etc...) 

2) Each time I eat, or drink something with sugar, I swish water around in my mouth, and swallow it. (This washes away the sugar, since sugar  fuels bacteria that causes tooth decay.) 

3) Swish my mouth with a good flouride based mouth wash (recommend Oral-B) once or twice per day.

4) Brush once per day. (Yup, I don't actually brush twice per day.... although I suspect I probably should.) 

5) Once per week swish my mouth with peroxide to kill bacteria. 

6) Change my tooth brush once per month. (I buy the big pack at Costco. Medium hardness.) 

PS: Most of the time I've been using that baking soda whitening tooth paste (triple strength). But I worry that it might, after all these years, wear away my tooth enamel. But so far so good... for now.

PPS: I've decided to make sure I see a dentist at least once per year, from now on. 

PPPS: Interesting tip: if you want to know if you have bad breath, or not, floss, and then smell the floss. And then you will know.",best toothpaste
