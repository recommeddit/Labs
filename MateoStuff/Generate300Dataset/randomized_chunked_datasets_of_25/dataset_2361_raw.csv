"boil a cup or two of water with fresh grated ginger, some turmeric, and some cinnamon. Once it has a yellow tinge its good to go. Strain it, add some honey or lemon (or both) and drink up"
The preferred breakfast of Gentlesirs everywhere.

"Was out with my husband one night and we ran into our lesbian friend.  She greeted us with a hug and I complimented her on her cologne and asked what it was. She said it was Sauvage.  
Well, I guess I seemed really into it because my husband went out and bought it the next day."
This is very true. Our best experiences have been had in places recommended by friends and co-workers.
"Here are some of my favorites in no particular order. I'm also sure I'm missing a few:

Red Rising series by Pierce Brown

Saga of Seven Suns series by Kevin J. Anderson

A Deepness in The Sky by Vernor Vinge (this might just be my favorite book)

A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge

Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie

We Are Legion (We Are Bob) by Dennis E Taylor (Also a series)

Expeditionary Force series by Craig Alanson

Galaxy's Edge series by Jason Anspach and Nick Cole

Rocheworld by Robert L. Forward

Dragon's Egg by Robert L. Forward

The Forge of God AND Anvil of Stars by Greg Bear (The first alone is disappointing in my opinion)

The Circuit by Rhett C. Bruno

Galactic Liberation series by B.V. Larson

Spiral Ways series by Joel Shepherd (I'm currently on book 2. Book 1 is a slow start but this is an epic saga)

Rendevous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke

The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey

Saturn Run by John Sandford Ctein

"Nina Turner and Bernie would be on the list for me, but Warren wouldn't be anywhere near it."
Twin Peaks - esp S3 of TP & S3 of TD
Paramedic-SOBxRBE
Can't believe this is the first Johnny U mention I've seen
"The intermediary value is useful though,

    const res = await fetch('...')
    // res.status
    // res.ok
    // res.headers

Often, I'll look at the result of `ok` end either throw or return the result of `res.json()`"
"Joel McHale. He actually tried to make me laugh (and did and even laughed at my jokes.) He was ""on"" even though I was the only one he was talking to. It was clear he cared that I was a fan and wanted me to continue to like him. 
Also, Penn Jillette said I was tall and beautiful. I was standing in a crowd and was head and shoulders above the crowd so he saw me even though I was far off. Actually, Joel McHale said I was the tallest girl in the room. 
I guess celebs are confident to point that kind of thing out."
"I like MGK for motivation. It is rap, but tends to be about pushing through personal struggles, rather than balling at the trap (which I also appreciate). When I am sitting in my bed contemplating going into my workout room, I play this:

and it never fails me. I go work out."
I live in montana and its not the favorite candy its just the cheap stuff everyone gives out for everything... And i mean everything....
iPhone 6 series sucked! Has bend gate etc! Anything from the iPhone X up I’d say is a great phone and will last you years! The iPhone XS series is a amazing series just as the 11 the iPhone 11 series will be supported alittle longer than them all and the A13 will last longer!
"Starlight-12 if you get one, I like the finalmeme shape."
"Forza Motorsport 7 and Project Cars might be what you’re looking for.  Project Cars 1 and 2 tried to be more proper sims, where I think Project Cars 3 is more of a simcade, and supposedly the best of the series for playing on a controller.

Haven’t played Forza 7, so I’m not sure if it still follows Horizon’s pattern of just throwing tons of money and cars at you from the get go."
"That's the commercial stripper...

Many of the features discussed here aren't on the $39k model."
Or he found the book and messed with you about figuring out the ending from just the trailer.
"Probably the most popular Philippine breakfast: [TAPSILOG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tapsilog.jpg)

**TAP**a (dried or cured beef, mutton or venison) +  **SI**nangag (garlic rice) + it**LOG** (fried egg)"
"I do not use them. I get up at 5am and jog for 30 minutes. Take a shower, eat breakfast and go to work. I work at a desk for 9 hours (1 hour lunch break) then go back home. If it's Monday or Wednesday I watch my son for an hour while my wife goes to water aerobics with her sisters. If it is Tuesday or Thursday my wife watches the kid while I go boxing with my friends. Then I make dinner and play with the kid until around 9-10pm depending on when he'll go to sleep. Then we go to bed. At no point in my day do I ever lack for energy."
"Will do, thanks!"

 Edit: personally I think this this production is more creative than the chronics"
"Stupid question, but my gmail (not sure if it's a default) won't load images unless you explicitly give permission. 

Do the trackers not work as long as I don't load the images?"
