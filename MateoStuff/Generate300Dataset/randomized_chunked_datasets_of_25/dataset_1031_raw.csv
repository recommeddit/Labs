"Any AOTP honestly. Apathy has come out with some new music recently that is close to what they used to put out. ""Stomp Rappers"" was released today by Apathy ft. M.O.P. and Celph Titled... it goes hard."
Pitaka and I may pick up a Saddle Brown Apple Leather case. Those are the 2 I have been using for a few years now. Love them both.
"I've never jumped there so don't listen to me. In terms of biggest reputation though it's

2. Elsinore
3. Wait, there are others in the area?"
"Shape wasn’t too bad, I just placed my thumb too far below the side buttons so it was kind of a pain to reach up for them, it was also kinda weird to pick up to place back in the middle of my pad"
"I have yet to be let down by my 3yr old Anker.

Someone give this man a job.
I mean to be fair this isn’t really a true top ten list. All rotten tomato rankings mean are what percentage of the critics would recommend the movie. Not even the website itself tries to claim that it’s a true indicator of quality. The ranking does have some worth but it heavily varies based on the individual.
Thank you :)
"I don't have an HD near me, so it's Lowe's or Menards. Every time I go to Lowe's I always swear I'm going to boycott it. Definitely Menards."

"I know it's a little crazy and I'm not sure what you and your Fi are into, but my hubs and I did an all inclusive safari resort in South Africa. Absolutely life changing, and different from the normal all inclusive honeymoon. Londolozi was heaven on earth!"
Damn that was a good book . Quite original too .
"If you get Ginko, make sure they are male, not female. The female fruit stinks to high heaven. 

I don’t think there is anything more beautiful than a red maple in the fall. 

Don’t overlook blueberry bushes for beautiful fall color."
I thought I caught all these but I had missed this one somehow!
"I think I can answer this from a different perspective. The Mexican American War was taught differently in New Mexico, both because it marked the date when we came under United States control, and because it marked the start of a long period of abuses by American forces and American citizens.

We devoted a good amount of time in our New Mexico history classes to learning about the war. We didn’t focus much on the battles, because New Mexico saw relatively few combat actions (at least between uniformed forces). Instead, we focused on relations between the New Mexican natives and the United States. We learned about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the promises and guarantees that were made to the New Mexicans, and how those promises were systematically broken. 

New Mexican land grants were routinely encroached on despite being protected by the treaty, and when the rightful heirs would try to challenge this in court, they often got nowhere, since no Spanish language proceedings were available, they were challenging wealthier landowners and developers, and records of land ownership were often intentionally destroyed in arson attacks. Land grants and water rights are still major political issues in New Mexico, so it was essential that we understood the roots of these problems.

My hometown is the place where General Kearny first announced that the United States was occupying New Mexico, and we have a historical monument to mark the spot. We also learned about the armed Taos Revolt which took place a year after the US first occupied New Mexico, but I didn’t realize my hometown was the site of a battle in that revolt until earlier this year."
