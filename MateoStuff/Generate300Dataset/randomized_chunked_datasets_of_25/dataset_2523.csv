Now that the 11 came with 4GB-RAM, extra cam, slightly better water resistant, slightly bigger battery to the XR left very little room for hate. Plus the 11 launch price is $50 cheaper than the XR launch price.",best iPhone

15068,"At the risk of being 'that person' and making your opinion flip, a lot of it follows the idea that things women like are inherently not as good/worth people's time; More women are into romance novels than men so they hold less value. Star Trek was seen as childish drivel when the fanbase was all women, but when men started watching it became a sci fi classic overnight. Same with video games. Same with a lot of fiction that we have dubbed chick lit: If we brushed off all military fiction and action novels as dick lit people would be up in arms. Fan fiction isn't 'real writing' because most of the writers are women, even if a lot of them are published authors in their 50s. A lot of decent musicians, namely the Beatles, were derided for years because the fans were women, meaning they were just a silly boyband, but now most people consider them one of the most important bands in our history. It's especially bad when it's *teenage* girls. It's a whole thing. 


Sorry, had to get that out since it's an important factor in the... Delegitimising? of certain subsections of literature, art, film, TV, music, general culture etc. 


See also: cooking as a housewife is unskilled, basic labour with no value but being a chef can make you very rich and famous. Things like knitting, embroidery and crocheting aren't art no matter how much skill is needed, they're just boring crafts. 


Regarding CMBYN I guess it's just a matter of what you're personally comfortable with, you know? My boyfriend and I both think it's icky but you can argue that's because we're both queer and were assaulted/abused by people in similar positions. I absolutely respect your difference of opinion, it's just a case of something not being for me. In a way it's similar to my teenaged self really enjoying Forbidden, which is a book about incest (though I absolutely don't agree with it and what went down in general it's still an interesting love story), or all the people who adore Loving Annabelle, which is about a student seducing a teacher.",best romantic novel

21671,"The New Yorker [article](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/01/121001fa_fact_parker?currentPage=2) about JKRowling had a kind of funny/sad quote about Milne:

>In the decade or so after A. A. Milne published the “Winnie-the-Pooh” books, in the nineteen-twenties, he wrote several plays and novels for adults, as well as an autobiography in which he expanded on a thought expressed by a character in an Arnold Bennett play: that the artist who has early success with a painting of a policeman is expected to paint policemen forever. 

>Milne wrote, “If you stop painting policemen in order to paint windmills, criticism remains so overpoweringly policeman-conscious that even a windmill is seen as something with arms out, obviously directing the traffic.” 

>He added, “As a discerning critic pointed out: the hero of my latest play, God help it, was ‘just Christopher Robin grown up.’ So that even when I stop writing about children, I still insist on writing about people who were children once.”",best winnie the pooh comic

Psychological? I think that may be what you're looking for.

And if you want a movie that that throws a mindfuck at you, I'd recommend Donnie Darko and The Book of Eli.
As for something that involves the human mind, I'm not recalling any movies, but I'd recommend Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime). There's a lot of insight into the main character's inner conflicts.",movies like Inception
