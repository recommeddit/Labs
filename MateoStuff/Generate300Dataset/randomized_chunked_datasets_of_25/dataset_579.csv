7782,"Hi Sir, 

I was wondering if you could assist me with my quest for a new laptop, as I am a bit new to finding good Razyn/Intel laptops. It has to be a 2 in 1, somewhere around 13.3 to 15 inches, and the budget is between $1000- $1200 CAD (\~$800- $1000 USD). I am an engineering student and primarily use it for school. As a benchmark for power, I would need to be able to use it for the regular browsing/ working on Microsoft Office and a bit of python programming and also use Inventor 2021 (not ginormous assemblies, pretty modest beginner/ intermediate projects) I would like the most bang for my buck, I came across this HP ENVY x360 Laptop - 13-ay0021nr, I was drawn due to the high ram, however, I only saw it on the American Store, and I could not seem to find it in Canada. Do you happen to have any other recommendations? Any help would be appreciated, many thanks!",best laptop for general use

3861,"Many people are doing a job that has nothing to do with their field of study. And most good jobs are closed to people who do not have a college degree, even if the college degree they have has nothing to do with the job. 

If you're going to college to learn, that's nice, but the fact of the matter is, many if not most people are going to get that stamp. Taking out a loan that is the equivalent of the cost of a house just to learn is… noble, but not really practical for most people. Unless your parents are paying your way or something, in which case, sure, follow your heart.",best online college
