7272,best iPhone,I would suggest you go for the 11. There will probably be a nice discount on the 11 and it will probably have more years of support for you. I have an XR and enjoy it a lot but 2 year old tech will usually get abandoned 1 year before 1 year old technology (the iPhone 11)

17818,best Kardashian,"What? Where are the Kim stans, I'm actually surprised

Starting with the best:

Kim -- motherhood for sure changed her for the better. She is my fav now. I think having kids made her a lot less selfish. She paid for a team of some of the best attorneys (Who all charge a pretty penny per hour, im sure!!) and used her platform to free a woman from prison, which is actually amazing. She actually got the president to pardon someone. I appreicate how she tries to use her huge social media following for social justice. She is very honest, she interviews well, she is very devoted to Kanye and her kids, and she gets shit done.

Khloe -- the funniest. I love how she interacts with her fans regularly, on Twitter and on her Instagram comments. She used to get so much criticism for being the ""ugliest"" sister, but she just takes it into stride. Yes, she is going a lil crazy w the ass injections -- but can anyone really blame her after always being compared to Kim & kourt, who def are more conventionally attractive? She was the first one to take working out seriously, too.

Kris -- the matriarch. She also gets shit done. And while she can be selfish at times, I do think she loves all of her kids deeply and taught them how to work hard and go after your goals. Respect.

Kourtney -- I appreciate how chill Kourt is, but she is definitely the dumbest out of the 3. She reminds me of suburban moms who are anti-vax cuz they think vaccines cause autism. Like she turns off her Wi-Fi ""cuz of the radiation""... Wifi is NOT radiation in any way, it cannot cause cancer, please do not spread misinformation like that on your show! I feel like she is the most judgmental too, looking down on her sisters for not eating ""healthy"" like she does, or for not being as great of a mom as she is (Which is highly debatable). 

Kylie & Kendall -- I'm meh about both of them... they are just too out of touch w reality and aren't on the show enough for me to really form an opinion."

14092,best place to get free books,Since we are doing books can someone find me the book called naoko by keigo higashino ? I've been searching for it for over 5 years now. The Amazon copy is fucking overpriced in my country

7754,best laptop for general use,"Hi, take a look at my [gaming laptop list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/jm28sb/best_gaming_laptops_updated_for_november_2020/). Let me know if you have any questions."

30195,best Mexican war to study,"For me it was “two countries has a dispute over border (Texas). One wanted it here, one wanted it there, they fought, US won. I know this is extremely simplified and I left out a lot of details, but that’s the gist of it"
4961,best home improvement store,Victoria’s Secret
7857,best laptop for general use,That's amazing. Would you recommend it over the asus zephyrus g14?
63449,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Yeah, both works on ios 14.3"
14735,best romantic novel,"I agree. While mostly all I care about in a quick book is the main characters and plot, Pride & Prejudice has such a richer story. It's not a quick read, even if it's not super long."
45092,best items under $100,That's some top tier /r/toofers action right there
70406,best major to study in college,I studied geology (I love this subject so so much). I don’t necessarily regret it but now I work in biochem/analytical Chem and kinda wish I majored in bio or Chem to get a better background understanding on what I’m exactly doing.
5110,best home improvement store,"Home depot. I find that similar products are almost always either cheaper, OR higher quality at HD. I use Ryobi and Milwaukee cordless tools (not sold at Lowes). Lowe's is closer, though, so I'll go there for pest repellant, lawn chairs, maybe gardening tools...it seems like 60% of the time when I ned something very specific, Lowe's won't have it, and then I'll need to go to HD anyway. I've had better luck with home Depot's customer service."

13261,best gifts for mom,"Spending your time with them. Plan to take them on a trip (holiday if you're loaded, day trip somewhere if you're not!) I can't buy my parents anything they need but I know they like spending time with me. As a parent myself the moments I'm happiest are when the little ones choose to be with me!"
70255,best major to study in college,"hahaha I think we have different definitions of fun! I absolutely loved reading and writing new things in my classes, and my university offered lots of cool electives. I think you've nailed it with pairing an English major with a variety of minors and then exploring internship/work options. It's a bit of a bummer that so many people look down on English now because the writing, critical thinking, and communication skills you practice on a regular basis are so useful for a variety of jobs."
