"Also, there's a language issue. I did research in France, and there is a cultural preference to publish in French in many circles (or a resistance to publish in English, the result is the same) which limits exposure to the rest of the world which mostly publishes/reads in English in academia. This can reduce the impact factor rankings of French research, and correspondingly downgrade the perceived research quality of French universities, which are actually excellent schools in general for both teaching and knowledge output."

"Na you definitely weren’t the only one, it’s just that me and I’m sure some other movie go-ers didn’t pay attention to that kinda stuff and assumed status quo was god."
Can you explain why without spoiling anything?

"1. Yes I think hien is a great pic! I also had a mp510 desk pad size. I liked it! The Cordura feels interesting for sure. Since you're used to slightly rough surfaces and want a little more speed, hien is perfect!
2. So I just go right to artisans website, provided there's no Japanese characters then you made it! I just good artisan mousepad and generally a link for the hien pops up, I usually go there and as long as it's in English, then you're good. You could order from the Japanese version, but not sure how that works with Google translate... I wouldn't risk it.

I think the top 3 (zero, hien, otsu v2) are out of stock right now. Check out @IsArtisan on Twitter for when they go in stock, or regularly check the website to see."

Den of Thieves. the last 30 mins of that movie was wild
"I just went friday, I agree on most things minus riddler. I would probably bump full throttle to #2 because its smooth and reridable. Not really sure where riddler ranks but its high for me,  I love standups. Getting the restraints right is all the difference.

Twisted is in competition for my top #1. After only doing NTG, twisted is insane with the off axis twists, double downs, and inversions, where NTG is only small straight ejector hills. Not to mention I got to race or get close to racing 4/6 loops around."

"Good list, but gkmc shouldn’t be there imo, a bit unfair that Kendrick takes the top 2 spots. Also I wouldn’t really count Endtroducing as a hip hop album"
They all smell very different.

Had leather for my two last iPhones but I want to switch back to silicone for that pristine matte look
I hand scooped those delicate looking little bastards at my hotel. Actually it was an enjoyable task. Much better than polishing silver!
I got the Nomad this time around. You can see the patina on the website and it looks sick.
Are you Alan Partridge?

Can confirm. Am genius. Green is my favorite color.

"Like I said. Personal preference. Some people think arrowhead is the greatest thing ever, gives me a splitting headache. I mainly drink my city water, it’s not terrible. Reuse the smart water bottles until they are not worth cleaning any more."
it doesnt sound weird at all... in fact many doctors actually prescribe it for a bad throat.
