1002,"But there's also fake vanilla that gets extracted out of wood (correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure that it was wood)

Edit: vanillin (at least it's called that in German) can be extracted out of wood and even be made with cow manure.. At least a scientist in Japan managed to do it, it even requires less energy to get the aroma extracted out of three than it does to get it out of wood. So yeah.. the ""all natural"" on your vanilla icecream is true, but it doesn't have to be actual vanilla.",best ice cream flavor

I make a gelato base with a tsp of vanilla extract.  Once it's cooled I mix in 4 tbsps of bourbon.  I usually use Makers b/c it's sweeter.  And then mix it up.  It's got a nice vanilla/brown sugar/oaky flavor and the coke floats are delicious.",best ice cream flavor

I spent past two years on it and just released.... ironically only on iOS right now.   It was my biggest bucket list item im life so to get it live means so much to me just from a personal accomplishment if it.  So it's my favorite game.  It's called Battle Maps,best iOS game

8981,"Again, lots of marketing going on. I stopped trying to keep up with every new toothbrush 'innovation'. It seems that every few months there are all kinds of wacky handle and head shapes, bristle configurations and colors. I remember a time when a toothbrush was pretty standard fair with a garden variety design that didn't change much. I can't pinpoint the date when things went apeshit, but it was sometime in the 90's. Anyway, Oral B, Crest, Colgate, Reach all make effective manual brushes, but I personally use a Sonicaire electric, which I think is more effective for most people. Not that you can't get the job done with a manual. If your dentist likes your gum health and you've been using a manual, stick with it, but if your gum health could improve, I would consider the Sonicaire.",best toothpaste
73180,"I think Linux mint and Ubuntu would be a good start. Linux mint is essentially Ubuntu but runs a lighter desktop enviroment. Regardless of which you choose you can always install another desktop enviroment if you choose. Being a beginner my self I recommend these 2 because they are very popular and have good support. Even though I have no idea what I'm doing whenever i run into an issue I can usually resolve it within 10 mins by googling and finding a solution on the first page of googling containing step by step instructions on what to do/what commands to run.

To me it seems like if a user needs another or some specific distro for their application they probably wouldn't be asking as they are an advanced user usually doing some wonky shit that beginners couldn't wrap their heads around.",best Linux distro

Either way it sucks for the patient, I understand that. But you have no idea how many people say they can't take x because it upsets their stomach.... Lots of medications cause upset stomachs, that's expected. Facial swelling and airway compromise is not, THATS an allergy.",best medicine for a cold
28417,"Breakfast pockets

I make a big batch once a month and keep them in the freezer. Pull one or two out before I go to bed and they're thawed out in the morning. You can toss them in the microwave to have warm but I actually like them better cold.

When I'm doing a batch I make my own pastry and roll it out, cut into circles, then fill with whatever mixture I like. Press sides of pastry together and crimp like a pastie, brush with a bit of egg wash, let rise for 10-15 mins and then bake at 190c for 25 mins.

Fillings are whatever you want to put in. Personally I like to scramble eggs and fry up bacon pieces, onion, shallots, tomato, mushrooms, shredded potato etc and mix all together with a bit of cheese and seasonings and make little balls out of the filling to wrap in pastry.

Pastry recipe:
1.5 cups water
2.5 tbsp margarine
2 tbsp molasses or honey or golden syrup
2 cups ww flour
2 cups plain flour
1.5 tsp salt
1.5 tsp yeast",best breakfast foods
