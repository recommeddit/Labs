I'm going to read the code later because I want to see how you've implemented that, but my python experience is limited (Java developer by trade, though I've used python a bit, mostly extending other people's code).

I don't exactly adore it for some of it's features which could be done a little differently, but it's pretty solid. I think it's been 3 years since I bought it? Not sure though.

I took one of my grad classes online and while I enjoyed the class, the format allowed me to slack off.  I noticed that as long as I clicked on other people comments (even if only looking at them for 1 second each) it showed that I was active and participating in all the discussions.

I have never been to SFMM, and the only real ""theme park"" I've been to is Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, but it most definitely makes a difference.  Most mainstream U.S. parks are sorely lacking on the ""theme"" aspect (your Six Flags and your Cedar Fairs).

One of the first things I learned in ride construction - specifically from John Wardley - was all about the importance of the scenery.  I hope to make it to Alton Towers one day, and I also wish more American parks put an emphasis on their theming.",best roller coaster at six flags
