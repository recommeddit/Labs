"Here's one of my favorite's: [""How long is the coast of Britain?""](http://nature.berkeley.edu/~bingxu/UU/geocomp/Readings/MandelbrotScience1967.pdf) by Benoit Mandelbrot. An incredibly clear (and incredibly early) discussion of the importance of fractals published years before fractal was a word!"
"What do you do with your linguistics degree, if I may ask? Just graduated with a similar degree and have no  idea what to do career wise"
Grammarly free version helps enough I would stick to that version
Dark on Netflix has a similar feel imo
"It's easily either B2W2 or USUM IMO.

Altho my fav is still XY"
I've got a bamboo one that's not too hot.
"It's a nice list, with many fantastic anime, but considering you compiled it from a list of blogs and ""experts"", you should probably mention those as references.

It's still an entirely subjective list with those references as well, but having references to what sources you've used, would make it a bit more trustworthy, as we know the lists this list is compiled from. There is some anime I'm surprised is missing from the list (Ashita no Joe as an example), which makes me interested in seeing what sources are used."

"I have an egg steamer that makes boiled eggs. I load about half a dozen eggs in it, and hit the shower. 18 minutes later, I'm out of the shower and the eggs are done. Quick trip through the ice bath followed by two minutes to peel. I do that while microwaving some bacon, and my son and I have a tasty breakfast."
Cheers!
"Hasent been my experience and info would be to the contrary. Rtings did pretty extensive testing and yes, if you watch CNN 24/7 you'll get dimming of thr most used colors(often red & blue) but as a monitor running different software throughout the day, I'll take the low risk. Just take advantage of the software help, and keep a Screensaver."
"aaaayyy! I got that too, smells good, clean and fresh but not overpowering. I'll go to like a Ross or Marshalls and pick them up for a few bucks."
"That X-wing is amazing, if we are talking about the same set. Prepare some place to display it, as it does come with a stand."

"Reviews are good if you ignore the really negative as these people tend to be outrageously demanding and put no effort in. Like people complaining about arriving with a plane load and whining at the time it took to check in then immediately demanding 5 extra towels when they get in the room and waiting for them for 3 hours. Why would you do that? I am not surprised your grumpy demanding ass had a bad time.

Look for people praising the stuff you like and their interactions with entertainment crew. Some try harder than others. The ones that make an effort to involve people, we found, were better, regardless of the number of stars. 

If you are a beach person, look for photos of a wide beach. Some are narrow and small. Some have a steep incline in the water so not so much wading. If you like pools, some have various angles on these. A beach/pool restaurant and bar are nice so you don't have to dress to indulge. Also, if it matters to you, the distance from the airport or points of interest to you might matter. The Mayan Riviera is kinda great for this. There are ruins and eco-parks not so very far. You don't even need to purchase hotel excursions. We were able to jump on local transport for a couple dollars and pay into the sights. We went to Tulum on our own and at least one park, probably more. We have driven up and down that highway from Cancun to Belize many many times. The buses are modern. There are places like Jamaica where they don't even advise leaving the resort so keep that in mind if you are adventurous. If you want a less touristy place and can deal with paying for your meals etc. Bacalar at the other end of the Yucatan from Cancun is gorgeous. Lots of backpacker types. You can wander the town. Good meals are pretty cheap off the beach. We had a nice hotel including an amazing breakfast for $50/night just a nip back from the water. Highly recommend the boat tour around the lagoon. Pack a cooler."
"Whatever you prefer is the most common answer because it's the only answer. Some people like smooth, light Reds. Some like clicky, more sturdy Blues or Browns.

I personally like Reds. I don't need a click (mechanical keyboards tend to be louder anyways, no need to add to that) and I like the smoothness for button mashing in MMOs or quick double taps in FPS games. A lot of people say Reds are worse for typing, but I haven't noticed any real issue with it over the last 2 years."
"I was rather lukewarm on it when I tried it, honestly"
