"At 3oz the Attom Tech 5000mAh is perfect for me.  Got it on amazon

Finding a onebank can be tricky.  For me it was more about weight than anything else.  I do the same with phones and my crappy Galaxy J3 is lighter than everything out there.  

When travelling though, I try to unplug and take in my surroundings/read/etc."
...I just... I need to go lie down...
Mine is arriving soon. Ordered golden brown.
"Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans (not the CGI remake bullshit) are two of my favourites.

In Jason i have always loved that they make a big deal about Hercules and then halfway through he just up and leaves. Its unconventional storytelling and i love it."
I don't think this is a dumb opinion at all but I'm also laughing at how predictable this answer is
Username checks out!
"Nope. I meant to type

    txt when you get here

But I was typing fast and I ended up typing

    ttx when you get here

But I missed the 'x' and hit the 's' instead and it ended up as

    tts when you get here

And she read it as

    tits when you get here"
"""I think steel boils at that temperature"" ... Can't stop laughing"
Go for it. I put off getting one for years but finally pulled the trigger at the start of this year. It is so nice to have a place to put on sale meat and vegetables. My power bill did not seem that adversely effected.
They were the best team or they were something else? Can't understand you.
"Encre Noire A L'Extreme. Repeating what has been said a million times, at this price point, you really can't beat what it delivers in terms of potency and character."
"My day time go to is currently Prada Infusion de Iris.

It’s woodsy, floral, light, powdery, but not overwhelmingly so. It has non of the saccharine sweet “femininity” that many modern perfumes for women have buckets of. Feels sophisticated without relying too heavily on “sexy” notes. And is subtle enough to wear in the office so I don’t knock people out with my fragrance."
"If you want adventure, try Rafael Sabatini's books. If you read several of his books you night notice some plot elements get repeated, but they're still great fun. *Captain Blood*, *Scaramouche*, and *The Sea Hawk* are, I think, his best-known.

And of course I have to add my usual plug for the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. Some of the best historical fiction around.

Sword and sorcery adventure: Conan the Barbarian stories by Robert E. Howard. Very good light entertainment. Howard is no Tolkien, but he does evoke something of the same feeling of an entire world out there of which he's only telling parts. There are various pastiches of Conan, but they're generally not quite as good as the original stories. Amazon has a Kindle edition of Conan for $0.99."
"I would recommend the 11 for the extra 100$. Better proccessor, battery, cameras, especially cameras and youll have the U1 chip."
I grabbed the book off of my shelf to check the last line and I am not following......
"My dad is a master of dad jokes and last year I found him the perfect gift, a [World's Okayest Dad coffee mug](http://www.worlds-okayest.com/product/world-s-okayest-dad-mug). He took it to work and uses it every day."
Definitely happens. I be in the middle of doing some curls or something and start giggling.
It's easy if you book ahead. It also let's you see the countryside and meet more people
"Naked Genetics is good. ACS synthetic biology is a monthly interview podcast with paper authors, but it's just as technical and narrow as it sounds."
"Attack on Titan

Steins Gate

Hunter X Hunter

Made in Abyss

FMA:B

Konosuba

Violet Evergarden

There's a brand called Panda that make sunglasses out of bamboo which I really like. They're very lightweight but high quality. They used to run about $80 bucks not sure anymore.
People like makes the world a better place. Thank you.
"If you like low profile claw mice, the viper ultimate and g305 are great choices. Other than that the GPW is the only other lightweight wireless."
"If your gums bleed when you occasionally floss, then you should be flossing more. Otherwise I guess you're fine? The whole point us to dislodge bacteria and goop that your brush couldn't otherwise reach, so if you're really good at brushing or your teeth are really spaced out then you're finesauce."
"Finland, because it ranks at the top of every quality of life study."
