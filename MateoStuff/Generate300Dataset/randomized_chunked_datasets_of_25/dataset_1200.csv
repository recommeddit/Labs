  I say that I'm not really a big fan of HR, but, yet, four out of my top 5 books are historicals. Go figure."
71088,best movies with a cool twist,Identity w/ John Cusack
2976,best webcamera,"It depends on what you're looking for. I think it's unfair to compare them to Bose. Especially their mouse lineup is very serviceable for both gaming and productivity. Plus, their customer service is exceptional in the states at least. I used to have a mouse from a very ""gamer"" brand, but after the shitty product support and customer service, it'll take a lot for me to consider anything not Logi for mice."

I'm just being facetious to get some laughs. :)"
46171,best trick or treating candy,Baby Ruth
22432,best celebrity,"Was a server for Tom Cruise. Pretty cool dude, tbh. Was a bit out of touch, but that's to be expected. The funny part was he didn't know what he could order off of our menu, so he had to call his nutritionist to find out what to get. Ended up getting fried chicken"

47373,best state to visit in the United States,"New Orleans has a unique vibe that I haven't found anywhere else. Portland is quirky, very hipster. Chicago looks the most similar to New York but it's less diverse and the people are nicer, slower. Beautiful in the summer."

21874,best winnie the pooh comic,I hate that I love this so much
66209,best soccer team in the world,It's apparent that almost everyone misunderstood your poll. All discussion in this thread is based on European success and the voting seems to align with that for the most part as well.
53488,best medicine for a cold,I use the Dayquil/Nyquil pack. And if you can handle the flavor Theraflu is pretty good.

- House of Cards (U.S Version 2013-2018; great political thriller, focuses on corruption and has great narrative, created term ‚Äúbinge-watching‚Äù)
- The Spy (short-binge worthy drama that goes straight to the point)
- The Sinner (great psychological crime drama) 
- Sniffer (just try it out at first, crime)
- Jessica Jones (a detective, crime-related, great first season, not as comic book ish as you might think)
- Deathnote (anime ‚Äî simply incredible, questions morality, very good crime drama)

Amazon Prime: - Mr. Robot (currently on its final season, this show is just great ‚Äî many genres built into it but for good reason, underrated, a masterpiece imo)
- Beat (German show; focuses on a club murder and then leads into more, suspenseful, fun and interesting)"
