"I get my dad 4 dark chocolate bars every year, two for his birthday, and two for father's day(they're close together). He's an extremely healthy guy, and has a square whenever he's feeling a bit tired. His supply lasts him until the next year. It's not one thing, but a similar idea."
I really enjoy a lot of Maxo Kream and JID when I workout. Maxo’s music is a hard hitter too.
"Between the price, shipping cost, shipping time, availability, duty fees, and lack of customer support, I can't imagine its quality being enough of an improvement to justify it over other high-end pads.

I personally went with it because I like its unique XL length. So the fact its size would be a detriment to you means that you should look elsewhere.

>the same characteristics as an Artisan. 

Different Artisan pads have varying glide properties, so its hard to tell what you mean. But I hear fantastic things about the Aqua Control Plus."
"Porto, because they have Jesus."
"what do you think of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R939TYKyZUE) sound review? Does it misrepresent the switches? Both still sound unacceptably loud to me, with barely any difference in volume."
"To me the two stores are 100% identical and, I don't know if they do this anywhere else, here they literally build some stores *right* next to each other. Sometimes my decision boils down to things like whether I can turn left across traffic easier into one or another."
"I had that many years ago. Very nice smell. I first smelled it on some other dude and stopped him and said ""dude what the fuck is that? That's crazy."" Then picked it up at the duty free shop. Good stuff."
"The Act or Killing. It’s about a genocide in Indonesia, so it’s not light subject matter, but it’s incredible. They take the people responsible for these killings, who were never punished for it, and let the, recreate what they did. Some of them are clearly having the time of their lives, reliving their glory days, while others start to realize what they did. Watching the walls built in a murderer’s mind start to crumble is a truly incredible thing to behold."
Milk duds gang rise up
"I’ve seen several people who tried the 27GL850 and the Asus XG279Q, they all said the asus was better, one said it was much better. Not sure if they’re the same price where you are, but given how good asus’ monitors have been at the top end for the last 5 years I’d take the xg if I were you. Prad.de gave it a higher score than the lg too, and said it was the best 1440p monitor they ever reviewed, they’re much more thorough than most other sites too."
"Have you tried filling it up and leaving it in the fridge without a filter? 

A lot of the time the chlorine will degas and you can't taste as well when something is cold so just sitting it in the fridge would work just as well."
"""This is Hand. Hand feed us, don't bite Hand."""
"Edit due to misread:
When you use a vm, it runs alongside your other windows as it's own window usually.

Also, look into trying boot camp. It's a bit more complex to set up, but will let you store a windows machine alongside your Mac OS, so you can just boot into it at startup"
"I've always heard ""mmmJeeeenkins"""
"That is highly dependent. Some companies (usually larger ones) have ""Web development"" split between three areas:

Web development (Front-End). Web development (Back-End). And User Experience (Design).

But for more in-between mid-size companies you'll likely be involved in at least a little of both the back-end and design."
"Totally agree with everything.
Who's your no.1 villain, because for me it is Wenwu.
Also, Tony Leung should come back for at least a five movie deal with Marvel because I can't get enough of him"
"Spigen Hybrid initially (yoloing and picking up my order while on vacation), but will also be ordering a dbrand grip case for use afterwards"
lol you really think they won’t rip it open to check the contents?
"I'm with you on that, fight my friends about it all the time lol"
"Thanks! I think I’ll go with the RavPower as I’ve found it on Amazon UK for a good deal.

I live in the UK and will be using the charger in Europe, so now trying to work our what different adapters and cables I need for my iPhone X and EU plugs."
That can be anywhere from Pensacola to Tallahassee. But it seems at&t overall has more spectrum there
"Gin and soda with lime

Diet coke (or coke zero) with rum and lime

Vodka soda with lime

Bourbon on the rocks."
"If this kind of thing worries you too much why not go vanilla? No deps, no external worrying, full control, and if there are gaps in your knowledge of all the stuff you need to account for when making requests, you'll sure have the bugs to fix and loads to learn..

Obviously depends on how much time you have and the type of application, Yada Yada Yada"
"Very alcoholic, very tasty, very bad idea (for me at least)"
