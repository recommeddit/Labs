"You can make a great entrance with it if you play a well-known movie theme.

"Generally just the regular commands (cd, ls, mv, cp).

Tab completion helps a lot. I have a few functions for some shortcuts (`p dist` will look at the project I'm in and cd to the appropriate directory-- and support tab completion)."
"Best: Garfield was the most accurate ultimate/616 Peter in live-action.

Worse: Holland, Don't see Peter Parker just see miles Morales"
this is good!
The Aztecs had the misfortune of being one of the few peoples who were more superstitious than Catholics.
As long as you purchase from the Ugreen store on Aliexpress its hard to go wrong. Almost every cable in my house is a Ugreen one. Amazing quality at a very affordable price. MFi certified too.
"My favourite is on your list, so here’s a little projection.

30-40 F. Well educated. A gardener or one who would garden given the chance. Real leather shoes and a white linen shirt.

You’re a good cook, and not afraid to attempt new dishes."

"Haha I'd forgotten about the radio ads. The down votes hurt, deep inside, but I get that it's not a favorite for everyone.

I've eaten there half my life and since moving away I still get homesick for it.

Did the quality fall off in the last couple years or do people just think it's boring or something..?"
Toby was great. Just that 3rd movie killed all the progress...
"Just here to ask everyone, no matter what your opinion of the retail company, the store, the brand, etc., that in the midst of everything that is going on try to remember that these retail employees are just folks like the rest of us. 

But with one big difference that you might not be thinking of: 

You'll make the trip to the store today, practice some social distancing, mask if you can, be mindful of what you touch, get your purchases and head home having come into close contact with no more than a dozen or so strangers. And you may only have to do that once or twice a week.

Retail employees are in these stores every day, eight hours per shift, encountering probably around a thousand strangers every shift, limited opportunity to distance, sanitize, mask, etc. For some it's quite stressful. They have families too, with loved ones they want desperately to protect. 

Cut 'em some slack."
Just reading this thread makes me realize how spoiled we are with great games this generation.
Why not paint on the wall?
Shouldn't math teachers be incredibly rich then?
"Kinesiology, for the most part, does a good job of preparing you for graduate school/med school/PT school etc. The problem is that only a small percentage of grads end up getting into those grad programs and a BS alone won't get you far unless your goal is to work in the fitness industry or as a PE teacher. 

What your area of study is in also matters. Biomechanics and motor behavior are probably the most lucrative in terms of careers since there's so much application to rehabilitation, device design, robotics, etc. Exercise physiology and the like not so much."
"Without a doubt this is my favorite war to read about.  The issues were extremely complex and the personalities were so interesting.  

It's also very depressing."

"I have Thunar since it's part of my xfce setup, but I only use it as an alternative for when I'm in a mouse-heavy workflow. However, I've found it to work pretty well using just the keyboard sometimes.  
As my main file manager, I really like ""lf"". It's similar to Ranger and other terminal-based, miller column, vim-like, file managers, but it's more minimalist by default and was much faster than Ranger in my experience. It's deliberately lacking some features (like tabs) that can be handled better in other ways (I personally use i3 tabbed windows.) It's very customisable but the project wiki has lots of good documentation and easy tips to expand functionality, so I think it's good even for a beginner. Ranger and other more complex file managers confused me when I first tried them because they just covered too much ground, whereas lf starts more sane and simple, allowing you to build it up to your own preferences."
"Tiger stripe. It's black licorice and orange. I have some very fond memories of this ice cream, though you can't find it anywhere. Chapman's makes/made it."
"Another LPT is that many universities have subscriptions to several scientific journals. Typically, your library's website will have information or a search engine that you can use. If that fails, talking to a librarian can be super helpful. They can sometimes request specific journals or articles for you."
I agree about Game vs Shadow. Especially when coming to the end of it for the first time. In the Shadow Series I enjoy seeing the governments interact and how characters view the world stage.
So you can take the swatch or a sample can (the little mug size) and go color match it with everything you want to buy.  Then if you get to a certain point and the paint doesn't match what you have found you like you can adjust for minimal cost and zero effort.
"Sorry, my humour radar is broken today."
"The Protector, Ong Bak 2, The Raid: Redemption, The Matrix Trilogy, 300, The Bourne Trilogy, the most recent Bond movies, and one of my personal favorites: Behind Enemy Lines. Very underrated movie."
I would recommend sticking to ethanol
