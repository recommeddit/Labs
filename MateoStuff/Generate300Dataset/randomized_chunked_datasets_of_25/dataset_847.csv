- does a request return 401? get a new token, save every request that comes by until the token is received, redo all those requests. the originating call will then be resolved with correct data (we handle this flow in 1 place instead of doing it for hundreds of requests)

- certain URL / patters need to be handled differently (remove or add some headers)

- track response time for each request

17825,"1. Kendal, she seems the most genuine and kind hearted of them all. She has always been my favorite. 

2. Kourtney, idk she always seems to be the most logistical, she is a strong backbone to the family imo.

3. Kim because kim

4. Khloe, shes hilarious! Always entertaining to watch! I just love her feisty personality. Although I think she comes of a bitch some times, I still think she is an amazing woman.

5. Kris, I love her... I really do. Sometimes she really bugs me but overall shes a great person and a great mother.

6. Robert, my heart hurts for him. I hope he finds happiness someday. .

7. Bruce/Caitlyn, in the early seasons i really liked Bruce, he was so chill and just minded his own business doing the things he loved. After the transition I feel like she was portrayed as this evil  entity. In the later seasons it was always awkward and so so cringey to watch them all interact with each other. I havent watched her show yet so I havent heard her side to then story. 

8. Kylie, by far my least favorite. Im not trying to be a snob but she drives me absolutely insane. I honestly can NOT stand her fake, self obsessed ass. She just comes off like such a bitch. Im sure irl shes a nice person, but I just HATE the way she is portrayed on the show.",best Kardashian
