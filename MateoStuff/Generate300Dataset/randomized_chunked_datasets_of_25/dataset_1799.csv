He mentioned his girlfriend likes shopping, and so she would love Rodeo Drive... Also, getting a double dip at Philippes is awesome!

And, it's not as if the distance between LA and SD is too far, only a couple hours, so both can easily be seen.... However, coming all the way from London, it may be better to spend a little more and drive the coast from San Francisco down to San Diego"

21957,best celebrity,"Having met **Hugh Laurie** in person, I can confidently state that he is one of the nicest and most humble celebrities out there. Not only is he completely happy to interact with his fans, but he also does so in a way that makes each and every one of them feel like they're a friend. He remembers names and personal details with amazing accuracy, and he makes each conversation seem like it's an extension of a treasured (and ongoing) dialogue. Add to that the fact that the man is outwardly hilarious, and you've got a recipe for a genuinely great guy."
