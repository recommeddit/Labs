43917,"Buy a slab of wood from a tree, and like 9 very small axes. They come by for like <5 bucks per axe. 

And you have like the party setup for guys. Playing darts by throwing axes. Protip if it doesn't go alright; The axe needs to make two full swings in order to hit right in, this is achieved with me by taking 3-4 medium steps away from the board.

Every once in a while a handle will break from an axe. But who cares right, for those cheap little axes. I've also found complete metal axes for 10 bucks, which doesn't break. 

Now you tell me throwing axes casually at wood with your friends as a game would not be *cool*",best items under $100

34259,"I think it depends on how they are defining \*best\* player in the league. It seems like they built this list controlling for positional value. 

Based on how PFF rates D-line players, they make a compelling argument that he should be this high on the list. When looking at his pass rush win rate and overall disruption rather than raw sack numbers, his performance warrants this high of a rating. PFF basically says that Mack consistently wins his 1-1 matchups and that matters more to them and their rankings than raw sack numbers.   


All that to say, I think Mack should be very high on this list, but I was surprised to see him come in at number 6.",best NFL player

The Off-Season - J. Cole

Dum and Dummer 2 - Key Glock and Young Dolph

The Plugs I Met 2 - Benny The Butcher and Harry Fraud

Street Sermons - Morray

Just Until... - Cordae (just an EP but still solid)


It doesn't feel like it's been a very eventful year in terms of new album drops really. The Off-Season was far and above my favorite. There was some good stuff on the AG Club, Paris Texas, Conway, and Moneybagg Yo albums as well but I don't think I've listened to them comprehensively enough to list them as a best album or not. 


**Best Songs (not mentioned but a no-brainer category):**


Black Rock - Mello Music Group

Lemon Pepper Freestyle - Drake ft. Rick Ross

Plug Talk - Benny the Butcher ft 2 Chainz

Scatter Brain - Conway ft. JID & Ludacris

Gang Signs - Freddie Gibbs ft Schoolboy Q

Big Boss Rabbit - Freddie Gibbs

Ramen and OJ - Joyner Lucas and Lil Baby

Seeing Green - Nicki Minaj ft. Drake and Lil Wayne

amari - J. Cole (only mentioning my fave from the tape, there's a number of them that I really like)

2 Chainz on Plug Talk by Benny The Butcher

Benny the Butcher on Theme Song by Klass Murda

21 Savage on My Life by J Cole

13720,">If your p-value is 0 you must have a discontinuous power function. If it's really an exclusive set of hypotheses then you must have a power of 1 for the rejection region. I.e. a single observation completely refutes or supports any claim like this...

Yes. In those very, very, very exact cases where there is only 1 variable, your p is 0 or 1; in effect, something happens or it doesn't — but this is not how it's reported at all. I'm just putting it into p-value terminology.

>Even in those papers I could imagine someone being interested in getting a second opinion thus reflecting a desire to improve n, even if it's difficult or weird in practice.

And that's why replication is critical, though, science in general today is more concerned with novelty. Or replication-if-extended-with-some-novelty.
