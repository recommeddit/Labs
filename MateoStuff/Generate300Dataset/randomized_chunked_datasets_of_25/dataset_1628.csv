21822,best winnie the pooh comic,"Hello! I was someone who commented on this post when it was *ahem* posted without your affiliation or even consent, and I just wanted to say I’m ecstatic to see it not only posted on the correct day, but even moreso posted by the proper creator. This kind of content is what this sub strives for, and the kind of horrifying subversion that this image portrays is critical to this sub’s success & growth.

It’s an amazing piece, and I’m ecstatic that I finally get to see *you* post it. And, as someone who’s been on this sub awhile, I can tell you that even though this has unfortunately been seen before on this sub due to certain unscrupulous individuals, I think this’ll still get the love it deserves :) If I can assure you of *anything* about this sub, is that people here don’t take kindly to art thieves."
8828,best toothpaste,"Hygienist—The only “special” thing about toothpaste is fluoride and fresh breath. Also sensitive brands that contain potassium nitrate.
Otherwise, just use one you like the flavor of."

45336,best gaming system,PS4 purely for the nostalgia factor it gives me.
29605,best game console,"WWE games are pretty darn fun.  Even though it's really outdated, WCW vs. NWO: World Tour is still my favorite wrestling game thanks to nostalgia.  But all the games are pretty darn fun.  It's not a first round pick for the list, but since its not available on PC I'd say its worth considering with more support.

Edit:  And the main problem of adding a wrestling game...WHICH ONE DO WE PICK?  feels like another iterative franchise that keeps getting better."
28179,best breakfast foods,"Yes, but one would never hear the term over easy in UK or Ireland."
72344,best keyboard switches,Have you tried Hako royals? Using some Hako royal true and I like them. Wondering if it’s worth the cost to move to zealio 67g. I love box navy so far too but have them on the number row and F key to avoid too much noise.
29968,best money managing app,"EveryDollar is my favorite. I didn't like Mint because even though it categorized, I didn't feel like it gave me a good idea of what was going where. 

&#x200B;

You can't link it to your bank account for free. That part cost 100yr. You can try it without the bank connectivity though and it beats using a spreadsheet. I did this for almost a year before I ended up just paying for it."
51231,best rap album,"Clique, God Flow, Morning maybe, and Mercy. Miss me with the rest. If u count Denim Flow, go ahead"
15327,best tree for the garden,Just thinking about that gave me chills. I would have never left.
37639,best Marvel movie,"How can something be overrated when any and every discussion about it devolves into a circlejerk about how overrated it is? Like I don’t get how you go into a comment section, see 75% of people saying “it wasn’t that good” and think the movie gets too much praise lol"
59654,best perfume,"We have similar tastes! I'd guess a woman in her 20s, likes scents that don't project too far; tends to like softer scents ranging from floral to sweet to woody. Maybe you work with the public or in an office. You like gardens or being out in nature."
31672,best hotel to live in,"my stepdad was like you way back before he met my mom and this comment ""As I get to know the staff I actually find myself sympathizing with them and trying to reject any pampering."" that's like him talking. I hope you enjoy it though i think it's something nice to do every once in a while, i like being alone haha, anyway i hope you post some pictures of the room i'm just curious"
28240,best breakfast foods,"During the week- yoghurt and fruit.  On the weekends if we're in the mood for something sweet it's waffles with Greek yoghurt,  fresh berries and maple syrup.  If we're leaning towards savory it's eggs Benny on latkes instead of muffins with homemade hollandaise...  Now I want some breakfast!"
36419,best alcoholic drink,"I did this. I don't drink pop unless it's mixed with alcohol. One day I took a sip of coke and asked a friend if it tasted wrong to them, if maybe the syrup at the restaurant had run out. Turns out I has forgotten what coke tastes like without that rum flavor in it."
52147,best iphone case,"I have the Apple Leather in Red. Great case, very slim and durable. Protects the phone well and still has the premium feel of the phone. Only downside - the price.
I also have this case from Amazon. It's very cheap and does wonders with protection.

36173,best alcoholic drink,use Hendricks gin-- made from cucumbers!!
36732,best alcoholic drink,"I totally agree with your post. That said BEWARE of mixed drinks that are advertised for cheap at chain restaurants, since usually they will be made up of cheap liquor.

Dallas BBQ in NYC, I still look at you badly all those years later after my NYC visit, for how much I felt like shit after drinking a certain drink(I think it was a margarita) there! Unlike another Mexican restaurant in Chicago(Cafe El Tapatio), where they actually do a decent job with their margaritas, and it isn't watered down liqueur that's a joke."
67396,axios alternatives reddit,"Fetch is native in node? Is that something new?

I was under the impression it was only worked natively in client side code."
22165,best celebrity,I miss Pushing Daisies :'(
57351,best water brand,"Yep, there are a bunch of regional brands they own. Poland Springs is another I believe. You can tell its one of theirs by the packaging and logo design."
63387,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Can someone please try dynamictimer . For me it didn’t work , but I’m not sure probably I didn’t know how to use it."
38328,best newspapers to read,"I wish it wasn't the case, for exactly the reason you gave because I want local papers to do well and local consumers seem to prefer print, but I don't see print coming back in any big way. What do you think these news services could do to better meet your needs? I don't have many ideas. I know kindles are recommended for their ""like paper"" quality, but other than that I'm kinda drawing blanks."
