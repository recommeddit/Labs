I was someone who commented on this post when it was *ahem* posted without your affiliation or even consent, and I just wanted to say I’m ecstatic to see it not only posted on the correct day, but even moreso posted by the proper creator. This kind of content is what this sub strives for, and the kind of horrifying subversion that this image portrays is critical to this sub’s success & growth.

It’s an amazing piece, and I’m ecstatic that I finally get to see *you* post it. And, as someone who’s been on this sub awhile, I can tell you that even though this has unfortunately been seen before on this sub due to certain unscrupulous individuals, I think this’ll still get the love it deserves :) If I can assure you of *anything* about this sub, is that people here don’t take kindly to art thieves.",best winnie the pooh comic
