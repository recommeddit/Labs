Todd Mcleod videos/courses on udemy and youtube for sure. When it comes to web development, Udemy has a few solid ones for Go.

There's also The Go Programming Language book which is the standard. It's a terrific book although it doesn't necessarily focus on web development. The Go Programming Language Phrasebook is another gem and I do not go to work without it.

46788,"> For surgical disinfection, you need to scrub in with a disinfectant soap (preferably with chlorhexidine) for 30-60 seconds.

That used to be the standard, but alternatives involving alcohol-based sanitizers have become part of commonly recommended practice, and are well-supported by studies.

Soap & water is still needed to deal with visible dirt, though, so recommended practices involving sanitizers include at least a soap scrub before the first procedure of the day, and may also involve both a soap scrub and sanitizer use before every procedure.

According to [Recommended practices for surgical hand: antisepsis/hand scrubs](http://www.medline.com/sterilliumrub/documents/AORN%20Recommended%20practices%20for%20surgical%20hand.pdf) (PDF):

> ""Degerming with an alcohol-based hand rub is more effective than washing with soap and water and requires much shorter exposure time.
Data indicate that the use of an alcohol-based agent may increase overall compliance with hand hygiene. (30-32)

> [...]

> ""Alcohol-based solutions reduce bacterial counts on hands more rapidly than do antimicrobial soaps or detergents in the majority of experimental in vivo and in vitro models. (3) Alcohol hand-hygiene products alone kill more organisms than any product on the market but offer no appreciable persistence or cumulative effect. Use of a combination of active ingredients (eg, alcohol and chlorhexidine gluconate) to achieve both rapid reduction of microbial counts and the persistence and cumulative effect needed to prevent microbial regrowth is desirable. Randomized trials demonstrate better compliance with a surgical hand antisepsis protocol using an alcohol-based hand rub agent than with the traditional surgical scrub protocol. (56-59)

The above quotes include seven references, given in the PDF.
