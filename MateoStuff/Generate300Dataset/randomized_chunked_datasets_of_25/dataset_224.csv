54130,best medicine for a cold,"Not so secret...

**Prevention**: Take vitamin D every day. Double your dosage as soon as it gets cold enough for you to not want to go outside. Wash hands often. Do not touch face with hands.

**Treatment** (AKA, weathering it really, there's no treatment): Hit the drugs hard and hit them fast. The second you feel like there's something other than a momentary congestion going on, hit the anti-histamines. Follow the dosage religiously until symptoms disappear even if you feel lots better before. Same with the aches and painkillers (Ibuprofen works better than Acetaminophen for me). Lay down as comfortably as you can. Stay hydrated and FED (starve a cold is bullshit), and most importantly: REST. As in sleep. Use as little energy as possible while your body is fighting the virus (movies, books, videogames and NYQUIL are great with this)."

8103,best toothpaste,"Toothpaste brands are all very similar. No one is over the top better than the rest. Toothbrushes, however... Buy a sonicare, they kick the shit out of every other electric toothbrush. Credentials: just asked my dad who has been a dentist for 35 years."

70127,best major to study in college,Pardon my ignorance but what's STEM?
65618,best phone service company,"Loving Teltik so far on the $40/month plan. 

When I signed up, they offered $10/month off for the first three months as well. Think I saw that promo was still a thing so $33.50 has been my bill for the first few months.

I’m actually not a huge data user, so I think I’ll just drop to the $30 plan when this third month is over."

25451,best cricket teams of all time,"Well, you’d pick the best side and Razzaq may or may not belong, early 2000’s Razzaq was an awesome bowler. Afridi on the other hand would certainly make it based on bowing alone."
23637,best car racing video game,"I’ve been keeping Wreckfest alive for myself and my community by doing a “Wreckfest Wednesday” event, such an underrated game, especially on a racing wheel!"
53113,best hiphop album,"Absolutely, man is from the future and the 70s at the same time. Detroit's really carving out a new sound with Bruiser Brigade and their producers. Fat Ray and J.U.S's tapes great too"

55309,best action and adventure novel series,"I'm a fan of Sanderson, but he writes fun, approachable, adventures that are one step above YA in tone and depth.

I'm not trying to knock him, his books really are well done, but Tolkien he is not."
4001,best online college,"I started out at a brick and mortar university but was unable to afford it. Tried going to a community college and they screwed up my financial aid three times in a row. The next thing on the list was online school; I'm working on an Associates in Counter-Terrorism Studies with American Public University. So far so good; I like my classes, professors, etc.

To note other for-profit schools, my dad has a degree from University of Phoenix and (I think) Kaplan University. He's an HR ""professional"" as he likes to say, and he's done just fine."
72593,best keyboard switches,"For me, the Cherry MX Speed switches are great for gaming. It has a 1.2mm actuation point, has a shorter travel distance, and it is actually pretty good to type on (unless if you have heavy hands, that is). They are also not that loud if you value a bit of quietness as well.

For typing, I will recommend Cherry MX Blues as they are soft and the clack is just amazing. However, some mechanical keyboard pros recommend the Topre switches, though, they are quite expensive as of the time of writing."
