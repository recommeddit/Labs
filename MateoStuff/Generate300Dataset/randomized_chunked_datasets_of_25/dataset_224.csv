**Prevention**: Take vitamin D every day. Double your dosage as soon as it gets cold enough for you to not want to go outside. Wash hands often. Do not touch face with hands.

**Treatment** (AKA, weathering it really, there's no treatment): Hit the drugs hard and hit them fast. The second you feel like there's something other than a momentary congestion going on, hit the anti-histamines. Follow the dosage religiously until symptoms disappear even if you feel lots better before. Same with the aches and painkillers (Ibuprofen works better than Acetaminophen for me). Lay down as comfortably as you can. Stay hydrated and FED (starve a cold is bullshit), and most importantly: REST. As in sleep. Use as little energy as possible while your body is fighting the virus (movies, books, videogames and NYQUIL are great with this).",best medicine for a cold

When I signed up, they offered $10/month off for the first three months as well. Think I saw that promo was still a thing so $33.50 has been my bill for the first few months.

I’m actually not a huge data user, so I think I’ll just drop to the $30 plan when this third month is over.",best phone service company

72593,"For me, the Cherry MX Speed switches are great for gaming. It has a 1.2mm actuation point, has a shorter travel distance, and it is actually pretty good to type on (unless if you have heavy hands, that is). They are also not that loud if you value a bit of quietness as well.

For typing, I will recommend Cherry MX Blues as they are soft and the clack is just amazing. However, some mechanical keyboard pros recommend the Topre switches, though, they are quite expensive as of the time of writing.",best keyboard switches
