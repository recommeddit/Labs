I have and enjoy many of those.

Can I nominate [Solitarica](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solitairica/id970202342) ? A great little rogue-lite RPG with solitaire mechanics.

A great game I wish would be available again is [Til Morning's Light](https://til-mornings-light.fandom.com/wiki/Til_Morning%27s_Light) from Amazon Game Studios. I still have it on my 1st gen iPad Air and it was so well done. I think the publisher chose not to update and keep selling it, so future gamers miss out :(",best iOS game

Did you know that news is the single greatest filler of landfills?  Madness.  Check out Rubbish: The Archaeology of Garbage for a good analysis on that, amongst other topics.  But I digress.  I think the news is a noble pursuit and the kindle, as well as devices like the iPad, represent a desirable future.  I know I never paid for news before I had a kindle.",best newspapers to read

33786,"> It is ok, certainly nothing special.

Being quicker around streets than a Giulia QV is certainly more than Ok. 

>They still overheat on the track, though nowhere near as bad as the S, they still can only run full hot laps on very short tracks; which is ok

3s don't overheat in the same sense that the Model S did. They just slowly pull back power. People are doing 10-15 laps without entering ""reduced power mode"" like the Model S did. 


>The 3 is not a sports sedan, it is a mid-grade commuter / family car with some really good acceleration for it's class (Accord, Camry, Maxima, etc.), it is just really expensive for it's class.

The 3 isn't in that class. It's directly aimed (sized and priced) to compete with the 3-series, C-Class, A4, Q50, and IS. Also, really tough to not consider it a sports sedan when it's beating its competition both on the drag strip and on the track. 

Besides, It has really good acceleration for any class. The P3D out-accelerates the M3, ATS-V, Giulia QV, and C63.",best electric car

37836,"Reasons why I personally love Civil War and have it in my top 3:

\-Zemo is one of the best villains and actually succeeds in defeating the Avengers without ever needing to fight

\-The relationship between Steve, Bucky, and Tony is heartbreaking. You just want them all to get along because you care about all of them, but you understand why they can't

\-The fight scenes are magnificent (Lagos, Steve & Bucky in the apartment, the airport, Steve & Bucky vs Tony)

\-The movie had PERFECT introductions for both Black Panther and Spider-Man. Perfect casting, check. Perfect characterization, check. Perfect costumes, check. Could not have asked for better intros for these two characters into the universe.

\-The ""Civil War"" between Steve and Tony is twofold, on a personal front because Steve is shielding his friend who killed Tony's parents, as well as on an ideological front because of their different perspectives towards the Sokovia Accords. I just like how layered and nuanced their conflict is and it provides a believable reason why the team is so fractured by the end of the movie/when Infinity War starts. It also gives the viewer extremely valid reasons to support either Tony or Steve, there's no clear-cut ""right"" or ""wrong"" side, which would have robbed the movie of its pathos.

\-The movie does SO much heavy-lifting in terms of setting up future plot threads, but it all feels natural within the context of the story, not quite as ham-fisted as other projects like Age of Ultron. The fact that the movie can set so much stuff up while also feeling totally coherent/important in and of itself, while also balancing the most number of characters the MCU had seen (at the time) is so damn impressive to me. For example, the movie:

1. Establishes Peter Parker and his relationship with Iron Man, setting up Homecoming, Infinity War, and Endgame
2. Establishes T'Challa and how he ascends to the throne of Wakanda, setting up Black Panther
3. Establishes the begrudging camaraderie of Bucky & Sam, setting up Falcon and the Winter Soldier
4. Brings back Thunderbolt Ross and shows us his Raft, setting up the inevitable Thunderbolts team we'll see one day
5. Brings Ant-Man into the fold as an Avenger, setting up Endgame
6. Establishes the budding romance between Wanda and Vision, setting up Infinity War and WandaVision
7. Establishes the falling out between Tony and Steve, which means Earth doesn't have a unified team to defend it, setting up Infinity War/Endgame
8. Establishes that Thor and Hulk are both still missing from Earth, setting up Ragnarok

Just my two cents on the movie though :) If the Russos can work out a deal to return for Secret Wars, I'll be so incredibly happy!",best Marvel movie
