Saw some reviews that complained about it not being what champaca smells like, but I've never smelled it and I try to not care what the marketing tries to make me think anyway. All I know is it's a lovely white floral that's just slightly different from the others and there's a creaminess in the base that gives it some extra depth and breadth.

37651,"I ran some numbers to check for biases and to compare aggregate rankings. The list holds up overall except in the top 4.

If you do a straight average it changes to:

Movie                                     Average Rank

Endgame                               4.93

GotG                                       5.23

Black Panther (tie)               5.46

Winter Soldier (tie)               5.46

&#x200B;

This changes slightly if you take out the highest and lowest rankings

Movie (high/low)                 Average

&#x200B;

Endgame (1/20)                    4.53 (who in their right mind puts EG 20th?!?!?)\*\*

GotG (1/13)                            5.11

Winter Soldier (1/16)            5.25

Black Panther (1/13)             5.35

&#x200B;

Captain America tFA and GotG swap places with averages if you take out the high/low and Iron Man 2 swaps with Thor:DW in both these scenarios. 

Everything else stays the same. 

regardless these are my top 4 in the MCU too (maybe not this order ;) Oh well just my 2 cents.

30625,">The British absolutely were seizing american property and preventing trade.

Which is considerably less heinous than torpedoing American ships without warning and drowning their crews like Germany was.

>no. They were making plans assuming that the anglophile Woodrow Wilson would eventually find a way into the war on his own, which he did.

'Making plans' because they knew that there was a good chance the US would enter the war after they resumed killing Americans at sea. Wilson would probably have been impeached if he hadn't asked for a declaration of war--which passed in congress with overwhelming majorities.",best Mexican war to study
