24635,best anime,Our list is similar if I did my top 20 berserk would definitely be in it btw good list.
905,best desk lamp,"i have the i-Tower, which is a 2-part version of the Z-Bar (which has 3 parts + base), also built by Koncept. It's great, the base is solid and heavy, which i love. 6 LED lights, mine is in daylight but perhaps i will switch to a warm light version. it's plenty bright, which helps because i spend a lot of time reading at work."
31039,best country to live in,Singapore should fit your bill.
50680,best rap album,"Love the Lloyd album, didn’t include it because it doesn’t have much mainstream appeal"
4553,best text editor,"I personally use vs code with vs-vim (I think it's called). It's surprisingly good!

However I recall the available vim packages for sublime were mediocre or way too much of a hassle to install"
46056,best trick or treating candy,"My dude, YES! I would fight my brother in armed combat for that shit if I could've!"
30132,best Mexican war to study,"That's correct, https://historyengine.richmond.edu/episodes/view/5495#:~:text=On%20January%2012%2C%201848%20Abraham,the%20%E2%80%9CSpot%20Resolutions%E2%80%9D%20that%20asked"
58857,best perfume,"I'm a swarthy dude and I love me some Champaca. Saw some reviews that complained about it not being what champaca smells like, but I've never smelled it and I try to not care what the marketing tries to make me think anyway. All I know is it's a lovely white floral that's just slightly different from the others and there's a creaminess in the base that gives it some extra depth and breadth. Lasts a long time too."
68644,best science fiction novel,man i know several people who gave up. I tried to tell them about the second half of the book and no one believes me!
51685,best iphone case,I got the clear Apple case for my iPhone 11!
54270,best medicine for a cold,You'd have to gargle 2 dickloads
67775,axios alternatives reddit,I use node-fetch because it's almost identical to browser fetch.
11805,best gifts for dad,Even better. My kids are still little though and they make them at school.
36647,best alcoholic drink,"Those in moderation, the caffeine speeds up your heart rate big time."
51963,best iphone case,Urban Armor Gear Civilian case allows it to sit completely flat. Got mine today. 13 Pro Max.
37651,best Marvel movie,"I ran some numbers to check for biases and to compare aggregate rankings. The list holds up overall except in the top 4.

If you do a straight average it changes to:

Movie                                     Average Rank

Endgame                               4.93

GotG                                       5.23

Black Panther (tie)               5.46

Winter Soldier (tie)               5.46

&#x200B;

This changes slightly if you take out the highest and lowest rankings

Movie (high/low)                 Average

&#x200B;

Endgame (1/20)                    4.53 (who in their right mind puts EG 20th?!?!?)\*\*

GotG (1/13)                            5.11

Winter Soldier (1/16)            5.25

Black Panther (1/13)             5.35

&#x200B;

Captain America tFA and GotG swap places with averages if you take out the high/low and Iron Man 2 swaps with Thor:DW in both these scenarios. 

Everything else stays the same. 

regardless these are my top 4 in the MCU too (maybe not this order ;) Oh well just my 2 cents. 

&#x200B;

\*\*Actually slant's list is pretty FUBAR so perhaps we just run it without them...hmm....."
4120,best online college,"Thanks. Does taking at least 6 credit-hours of classes there defer student loans like at a ""normal"" online college?"
55824,best action and adventure movie,The Transporter. Mission Impossible. All the James Bond movies.
10209,best pencil for drawing,"I checked at Big W, and you should be able to get set up for even less, pencils are about $1, visual diaries are less there too :0)"
56284,best action and adventure movie,"It's not the best, but National Treasure is just so damn watchable."
72822,best Linux distro,"No kidding. I don't know of a single person that has learned their Linux skills from VM use.

It needs some investment. Dual-booting is okay, but using only Linux and trying to get everything done on Linux is how people learn. An VM? No way."
65954,best college in california,At least there's a new ranking our UCs can top because they're about to get crushed on admission stats now that they're eliminating SAT/ACT requirements.
54258,best medicine for a cold,"The fuck's wrong with you? The most common virus that causes symptoms of a cold is known as rhinovirus. Secondly, if a cold is caused by your immune system removing toxins, then why does a cold spread through a community like one would expect an infectious disease to?

Fucking moron."
11009,best backpack for college,Do you mind telling me which style you own? I've been searching around for nice-looking backpacks as well.
30625,best Mexican war to study,">The British absolutely were seizing american property and preventing trade.

Which is considerably less heinous than torpedoing American ships without warning and drowning their crews like Germany was.

>no. They were making plans assuming that the anglophile Woodrow Wilson would eventually find a way into the war on his own, which he did.

'Making plans' because they knew that there was a good chance the US would enter the war after they resumed killing Americans at sea. Wilson would probably have been impeached if he hadn't asked for a declaration of war--which passed in congress with overwhelming majorities."
