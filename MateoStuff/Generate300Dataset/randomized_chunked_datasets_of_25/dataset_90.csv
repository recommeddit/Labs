34827,"I love Josh Allen, and his improvement as a passer has been a revelation. But if he doesn't change his running style, he's going to get injured trucking somebody. 

Find me a mobile quarterback, and I will find you 10,000 of his anonymous online supporters who will defend him by saying, ""He's not like the others! He's smarter! He's more agile! He's different!"" But he's not, and Allen is too good of a passer to be laying out linebackers head-on.",best NFL player

33923,"The starters in Gen 1 were your difficulty selection.  It's kind of ingenious, actually.

* Bulbasaur was ""Easy"" because you have type advantage in gyms 1 and 2, and neutral until gym 5 (Sabrina)
* Squirtle was ""Medium"" because you still had type advantage in gym 1, but were neutral in 2 and weak in 3
* Charmander was ""Hard"" because you had disadvantage in gym 1 and 2, and got your first advantage in gym 4 (Erica)

Since then, however, they decided to keep with Fire/Grass/Water as the ""tutorial"" on type weaknesses instead of focusing on the best types to modify difficulty level.  It's still there just by nature of how many type advantages and disadvantages there were, but it was never tuned quite like Gen 1",best Pokemon game
