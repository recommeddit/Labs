"Wondering, why hasn't anyone mentioned real racing 3 yet? It's way better than asphalt series. Real tracks, no stupid nitro or crashing or stunts."
"Off-road electrics are great, as you can make them completely water proof and they have instant torque, think about it, but I don’t like the idea of an American sports car having one just for nostalgia, but other countries cars can be electric, and our non sports cars and I will be fine"
"I bought a $1 back scratcher from an asian market in town.      
Best $1 I ever spent."
">Nevermind before In Utero?


a band's breakthrough album outranked an intentional ""Fuck you"" album? Yeah, more than likely..."
I guess it should be!
"Same, it’s a shame because they were a great duo years ago too!"
"Will check those
Thanks"
"""Not Me, Us."" My man has an actual plan to be Organizer in Chief.  And the majority of Americans WANT Medicare For All, Green New Deal, etc.

Those who say it can't be done should get out of the way of those that are doing it."

Battle cry is up there too for me.
"Nice try, UC recruiter, trying to sell out of towners on UC schools and pay out-of-state tuition.  Sweet, sweet out-of-state tuition."
"At the moment, an orange, a plunger full of black coffee and some pushups and sit ups. Weekends I might make pancakes. Once every month or two I'll do a full English."
"Sorry, it was supposed to be Kallis in the 2nd team. Fixed now. ANd replaced the Wickie."
"not OP but I like SciFi romance :) 

Do you have recommendations?"
I love Barcelo but really despise that there is a dolphin enclosure on site. :(
"Use Firefox, Edge or Vivaldi based on (for win 10 device with i7 processor and 8gb RAM):  
\-Speed : Firefox  
\-Less RAM usage : Edge  
\-Customization : Vivaldi (1st) and Firefox (2nd)"
"They started sticking them *in* the videos nlw too.

I dont mind the 5 sec clip at the start but Wish is a garbage store and forcing me to have to watch their shit ads multiple time isnt gonna make me change my mind. In fact, cutting so adburptly to it only reinforces my negative sentiment towards the brand."
Both are good. Schism off lateralus and Aenima are great too off of Aenima
"I'm using Vifm + dragon + ueberzug and I have ditched any graphical file-manager since dragon manage the drag'n'drop functionality. It's blazing fast and reliable. Going  CLI-only is good as well, zsh + fasd (jumping functionality) is ideal in this case."

>I've used this, for a client, and it looks fine. They suck because people dont know what 1080p means, or why they want it, and buy 720p or lower.

You linked to a webcam with a slow fixed focus 12mm equivalent lens and a sensor that I'm guessing is somewhere around 1/2.3"" Type if we're lucky (probably even smaller).

That is an example of a bad webcam, and the fact that you are seeing it as being an upgrade over most webcams further demonstrates just how bad webcams currently are. It may be sufficient for people's use cases, but that doesn't make it a good camera using modern technology.

The difference between that webcam (or the worse webcams you're upgrading people to that one from) and something like an Elgato Facecam (or one of the cheaper competitors without Elgato pricing) is night and day, and that's still not even a good camera. It's just better than most of the rest of the webcam market."
"They actually have a life-span of 10 years! If they didn't live long, it sounds like something went wrong."
"I just watched Layer Cake for the first time and was pretty shocked by the ending.  I wouldn't call it mind-blowing, but I definitely didn't see it coming (although I should have)."
Got me listening to this again. Man this album is like a fine wine.
"Of course there's a difference. They're entirely different stores. And HD caters more towards contractors, while Lowe's caters towards homeowners. (Lowe's is dropping that and going after the contractor market in the future though)"
"This sounds pretty interesting. How did you set it up specifically? A Berkey sounds great, but $300 sounds pretty steep."
