66077,best college in california,"No, I’m upset at the cost of education being 50k at a public institution and people thinking that’s okay for a public institute to charge that much to get a quality, public, education."
7683,best laptop for general use,"No, it'll spend most of it's time plugged in and a few extra pounds isn't a big deal."
43829,best items under $100,My bipolar medication. It’s cheap it helps control my cycling and makes it to where I can actually be a mom and be a wife instead of someone I honestly don’t feel like remembering.

33664,best electric car,It's on par if you're traveling down i80. Otherwise you're pretty limited. I guess it depends on whether you'll be driving long distances away from major interstates.
47001,best hand santizer brand,"Great comment, and along these lines, there's generally distinguishing antibiotics, which we are worried about resistance development to, vs. antiseptics and disinfectants, which are broad-based antimicrobials. I even found a great review [here] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88911/), which states:
>In general, biocides have a broader spectrum of activity than antibiotics, and, while antibiotics tend to have specific intracellular targets, biocides may have multiple targets. The widespread use of antiseptic and disinfectant products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular cross-resistance to antibiotics.

So you'll see, the review I'm linking even asks a bit about the question OP's asking, as the mechanisms of action of antiseptics aren't as necessarily well known as antibiotics (although this could have changed more recently, this isn't my field).  Frighteningly, it appears that there are microbes that *can* develop resistance to antiseptics, depending on their methods of sterilization - but the review clarifies:
> In these cases, “resistance” may be incorrectly used and “tolerance,” defined as developmental or protective effects that permit microorganisms to survive in the presence of an active agent, may be more correct. Many of these reports of resistance have often paralleled issues including inadequate cleaning, incorrect product use, or ineffective infection control practices, which cannot be underestimated.

So the TL:DR; antiseptics/disinfectants are much more broad-based than antibiotics with generally multiple intracellular targets ('kills indiscriminately'). There are reports of microbes developing antiseptic resistance although it's mostly speculative. Instead, there are antiseptic/disinfectant-resistant microbes, depending on the method of sterilization of the agent."
10724,best suitcase lock,Best LPTs are always in the comments.
62418,Best RPG game on PS4,I agree that they use overly simplified basic RPG mechanics. I feel like this is just to make sure that the games stay as accecable and maintstreamy as possible. Dark Souls or in general From games are an entirely different beast to conquer.

55947,best action and adventure movie,"Okay. I think that movies like Raiders or Back to The Future just don‘t get made anymore. That‘s why they are so special.

Try Thor Ragnarok, that‘s really fun and engaging"

20717,best workout music,Zombie- bad wolves
41997,movies like Inception,"I am surprised that this movie does not get more attention especially with the strength of the acting and special effects.
 
The ending has spoiled me on other *""edgy""* sci-fi stories (The remake of Twilight Zone for instance)."
