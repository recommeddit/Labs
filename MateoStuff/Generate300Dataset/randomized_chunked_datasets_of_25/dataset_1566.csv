47001,"Great comment, and along these lines, there's generally distinguishing antibiotics, which we are worried about resistance development to, vs. antiseptics and disinfectants, which are broad-based antimicrobials. I even found a great review [here] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88911/), which states:
>In general, biocides have a broader spectrum of activity than antibiotics, and, while antibiotics tend to have specific intracellular targets, biocides may have multiple targets. The widespread use of antiseptic and disinfectant products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular cross-resistance to antibiotics.

So you'll see, the review I'm linking even asks a bit about the question OP's asking, as the mechanisms of action of antiseptics aren't as necessarily well known as antibiotics (although this could have changed more recently, this isn't my field).  Frighteningly, it appears that there are microbes that *can* develop resistance to antiseptics, depending on their methods of sterilization - but the review clarifies:
> In these cases, “resistance” may be incorrectly used and “tolerance,” defined as developmental or protective effects that permit microorganisms to survive in the presence of an active agent, may be more correct. Many of these reports of resistance have often paralleled issues including inadequate cleaning, incorrect product use, or ineffective infection control practices, which cannot be underestimated.

So the TL:DR; antiseptics/disinfectants are much more broad-based than antibiotics with generally multiple intracellular targets ('kills indiscriminately'). There are reports of microbes developing antiseptic resistance although it's mostly speculative. Instead, there are antiseptic/disinfectant-resistant microbes, depending on the method of sterilization of the agent.",best hand santizer brand
