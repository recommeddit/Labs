12611,best gifts for mom,Itâ€™s payback for all the times we woke them up by crying as loud as possible.
26902,best board games,"I had a time in my life where I played hundred games per week.  
There is only a single game in top10 that I rate 6/10. Others are lower.  
And I don't think new people coming into the hobby should try any of them. Maybe Terraforming is easy enough to try, but still think there are better alternatives.  
And again I think that very few people can enjoy repeat plays of Pandemic Legacy (multiple campaigns). We have far better computer games that do the same thing as gloomhaven does and so on and so on. Of course the top10 are good games, but they are not THAT good.

Long playtime is a huge advantage in climbing BGG ratings. I've seen a correlation when I was doing my master thesis on boardgame recommender engine."
45548,best gaming system,"They were also looking to move to New Zealand or Norway. Hardly  countries you go to if you're struggling for money. It might be genuine, but it certainly raises some flags."
66829,best soccer team in the world,Players like Ben White going for 50m is the only reason why England is at the top of the list.

57750,best cologne,Dillard's
13380,best spreadsheet editor,I think he's doing it on purpose. He has a post saying Elon Musk is a moron. While Elon is a controversial figure no one would call him a moron. OP is just a provocateur edgelord
54784,best water filter,I use the Body Glove BG-3000 mounted to a dedicated faucet in the kitchen sink. The filter costs ~$120 and lasts at least 18 months (with 2 people and a few cats who all drink a lot of water). You can send the old filter back to Body Glove (they pay for shipping) for recycling.

6889,best iPhone,Isnâ€™t the 6 had the Taptic (Haptic) engine too?
46712,best hand santizer brand,"Aldi has been having Germ X in stock the last several times I've gone. They limit one per person, maybe this has helped. Also lots of hand sanitizers from local liquor companies, though they usually don't come in a dispenser style container so not as convenient."
1733,best ice cream flavor,BUT I DONT LIKE PISTACHIO.
42467,movies like Inception,American Psycho
59638,best perfume,"Thank you for taking your time to do me ðŸ˜Š Most of the points are quite close given that I don't usually act my age. 

I do love Netflix but I mostly watch Pokemon and anime on there. So I don't really keep up with pop culture. 

Gardening is definitely a big part. I definitely love food and thinking about it too much sometimes."
1029,best ice cream flavor,real ones recognize
30550,best Mexican war to study,"I suppose you could count the Libya thing but it was only 8 marines leading 500 Greeks troops. I had never heard of the Sumatra battle! Very interesting. I suppose for the sake of argument, we entered Mexico with the intent to defeat Mexico. In the land theatre in Libya we were basically leading foreign troops and in Sumatra it was a punitive strike for villagers killing the crew of one of our ships. Maybe it's better to clarify by what our intentions were when our troops landed on foreign soil. Thanks for the tip on the Sumatra thing. Something to learn about!"
6249,best Netflix documentary,"If you're interested in food at all, Chef's Table and Street Food are incredible.

Chef's table looks at some of the best chefs in the world and tells their stories, often delving into the driving forces behind their love for food. For some, it's an attempt to preserve the  traditional dishes of their culture. Others, they're trying to gain recognition their cultures dishes in high cuisine (they have one episode about a chef who's Michelin star restaurant is devoted to the taco, iirc). They're really lovely stories of humanity and love for food, and an incredible watch (for food porn alone, if nothing else).

Street Food: Asia and Street Food: Latin America are for the same director, and take a look at the street food and ""common"" dishes from various cultures. It's a great celebration of the common man, their food, and the struggles of these small-time vendors."
17797,best Kardashian,"Khloe, Kim, Kris, Kendall, Kourtney, Kylie"
32156,best hotel to live in,"It's a toss up between the Villa Dubrovnik and the Hoshinoya Karuizawa.

The Villa Dubrovnik sits on the cliffs overlooking the city of Dubrovnik and you can see the harbour and walls of the old city from the hotel. The service is top notch, the infinity pool is lovely, there's a private cliffside area to swim from, and there is a boat shuttle that will run you into the city and back so you can visit it anytime you choose. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are on the terrace where you have a view of the Old Town and Lokrum Island.  We had some of the best meals of our trip there. Favourite memory: sitting on the terrace in the morning having croissants slathered in jam, a cup of really good coffee, surrounded by the smell of the cedars, and seeing the sparkling water and the walls of Dubrovnik just across the bay. sigh.

The Hoshinoya Karuizawa is a mountainside ryokan (hot spring resort) an hour and a half out of Tokyo, and it's magical. The whole resort is surrounded by forest, mountain and water, and there are waterfalls throughout so you are never far from the sound of running water. Chalets with floor to ceiling windows, each with its own private deck, sit alongside the river, and every evening a boat comes to light lanterns that float on the water. It has two hot spring baths - there's the Meditation Bath where an enclosed hot pool leads through a tunnel into the quiet room, a room lit only by a single green light under the water, and the Tombo-no-yu baths, the open air hot spring baths with mountain views. Nearby there are woodland trails, a bird sanctuary and an ice rink for winter skating. again, sigh."
