9053,best toothpaste,"This is why I love using an electronic toothbrush, because it has a timer on it. Some days it feels like I have been brushing for ages, yet it will be quite a while before the timer goes! So I know I would have 'cheated' if I was using a manual brush in that case."

23495,best car racing video game,"The progression is so weird in Wreckfest, the first two tournament tiers are the most difficult because the AI is a much better driver in a slow vehicle than it is in a fast one. Even if you kit your C-class whatever out to have a higher rating than everyone else on the track, it's still a restart scum fest sometimes because they hit the ideal line perfectly with zero wheel slip and catching up to that if you're behind or damaged is nearly impossible. Meanwhile the same AI in an A-class vehicle will wreck out and disqualify on lap 4 of 6 nearly every time because they can't stop flying into guardrails."
