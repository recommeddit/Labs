"Include a drive on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Walk up Sharp Top mountain at Peaks of Otter (4 hours round trip including plenty of time to take in the view at the top and moderately strenuous).

On the other edge of the state, drive across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel and drive up to Chincoteague area and visit the Assateague National Seashore.  Visit Island Creamery for some excellent ice cream."
Predestination.
"Seconded. PHP may not be what you ultimately want to write your webapp in, but it's a great way of immersing yourself in server-side programming without much overhead."
United States of America if Bernie gets elected.
"One more for piano 
Here's what Dizzy Gillespie said about it:

**Learn to play the piano, man, and then you can figure out crazy solos of your own.**"
"[No Red Ink](https://www.noredink.com/) 

You can assign different topics for students to work on and itâ€™s free! I use it with my fifth graders. The best part is that the program asks about their interests first (movies, books, celebrities, etc.) so that the sentences are about topics they like!"

"We did better than that, we're funding it.

We decriminalized all drugs."
"I didn't know The Rock lifted at the same gym as I did, as it was in Central Virginia and was unaware he owned property there. When I saw what was a Rock look-alike, my natural ""confused face"" propelled my eyebrows into different directions: one up, one down. We made eye contact when this happened. I later found out that it was actually The Rock, and I had unwittingly given him the People's Eyebrow."
"I don't use their body spray anymore but I love their *Fiji* flavor, I've been using the shower gel of it for years"
"Could you explain ""DeDRM"" and ""bookmarklet"". Im afraid I've no idea of those lol"
"A downside to this I found was being too accustomed to it. When I had blackout curtains for a few years, I'd only be able to fall asleep in (near) pitch darkness, and exacerbated my insomnia if any other little thing was wrong.

Travelling? Multi-site camping? Crashing at a friend's or someone's place? All became completely sleepless nights. 

Naturally, this depends how much light your room gets and how often you might have to sleep anywhere else. Sleep masks work well, unless you're the sort to take them off in your sleep.

-------

Edit (after the first two sleep mask recommendations): I used eye/sleep masks as a transition period, but found it better to train myself to get used to sleeping with a bit of light. This was a bigger issue in my 20s when I'd often stay at a buddy's place or at a hook-up on a whim. I did get better curtains, but actively refrained from blackout curtains for that reason."
"I love Winnie The Pooh, I always had an imaginary world and still do, as well as a hard family life.  
This was beautiful, I can only hope my friends well come back to me when I'm old and alone."
Only after you get through security though. Don't want to have to shit out your laser pointer after the body cancer machine finds it
Below UC Merced? I don't think so.
"Hot water, gin, lemon, honey. Tastes awful, but you need to drink it while it's hot. Works a lot better than Vick's Vaporub on the soles of your feet."
"Mostly school but I do some light gaming. I am stuck between getting the zenbook or a 2-in-1 like the envy or flex because I don't know if I would actually use the 2-in-1. I always take notes on paper but I want to maybe see if I would like taking notes writing on the laptop, so unsure."
His game shows don't seem to get a lot of views but they're pretty well thought out games with interesting questions.
"And if you're even older and have given up on life just skip the water, the lemon and the honey and add in some Gin. If you're running low on supplies you can skip the brandy too."
"Personality-wise, excellent. But not the age (50). In your defense, I'm extremely young-at-heart."
"When some stupid program insists on using a GUI, pcmanfm.

Otherwise, I just stick to the tried-and-true CLI methods."
"Hayden Panettiere, who is the only celebrity I ever met, which was at Philadelphia Comic Con. She was super nice and took the time to talk to me and answer some of my questions and make small talk with me. Her publicist or whoever it was at the booth with her was trying to rush me along, as was the comic con staff/volunteers - but Hayden was like 'no, I want to talk to him let him say what he wants to say"". It really meant a lot to me."
"I like typing my reddit comments in `ed` via `rtv` because it is the standard editor, but when I have to type something complex I fire up `vim`. And I don't have any reason to capitalise the initial 'v' of 'vim'."
Interesting I might need to track down some and give it a shot
