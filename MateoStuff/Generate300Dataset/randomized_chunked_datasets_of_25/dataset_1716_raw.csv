Audience scores on RT are not reliable they're nearly as unreliable as IMDb.
"Compared to the rank __3__, yeah, 13 spots is definitely a large difference. Its subreddit rank is over five times lower than its bgg rank."
"I would suggest filtering by price. There is a field called ""cost"" that will let you do this. Off of the top of my head, you may also consider [Red Pocket's $5 annual plan](https://www.bestphoneplans.net/plans/red-pocket-500mb-annual) (you are required to send a message or make a call like once per month just so it stays active though), or you may consider getting a Google Voice number with a US phone number (if that's an option for you)."
"Forbidden Desert >>>>>>> Island by a vast amount, there's no reason to own island."
"Germany, a tiny YHA just off the autobahn. We were doing a lot of driving that day and just pick the closest one, it was a beautiful wooden cottage with a little old lady running the place, we gave them about 40 minutes warning at 8-9 at night, we took up to get but it was amazing. In the morning I was the most fantastic breakfast we had ever had in Germany so far. We forgot to circle it in the book and never found it again despite looking over and over again when we were doing the same route (airport to where my brother was living for 9 years)"
"I'm from the mid-Hudson valley region of NY (approx 90 minutes north of NYC). Right around here is where the countryside of New York State really begins. It truly is a beautiful state.

Don't feel bad though, I now live in California and I used to live in Virginia and Florida. 9 out of 10 people I tell that I am from upstate NY immediately classify me as a city guy. Other non city New Yorkers can testify to this I'm sure. When we tell people that NY is a beautiful, sprawling state they just kind of nod and disregard us. 

I'm fairly well traveled in the US and I would say that the Hudson Valley region as well as Northern NY during October foliage is the most beautiful place in the country."
"I've fixed this in the worst way possible...

Instead of buying a longer cable, i connected my regular charger to an extention cord.

^(Yes, I know I'm a horrible person)"

"Really? The Space Between Worlds has been getting a ton of buzz as has Mexican Gothic. I'd heard of The Once and Future Witches (and Harrow's other novel was nominated for the 2020 Hugos), Kowol has won a Hugo for a similar sounding book, and I don't think I need to mention Kim Stanley Robinson or NK Jemisin. 

This sub is a very bad barometer for modern SF, and while it isn't outright hostile it shares a lot of tastes with the various Puppies movements, in my experience."
"CS majors forced to take a theater/drama class?  That would be worth the tuition to watch.

Edit:Yes I know not all CS majors are socially awkward introverts, but a lot of people I meet, I'm in the industry, are ULTRA introverts who would like nothing better than to be left alone and not have any personal contact, at all."
"Am I totally missing something? There seems to be so much hate surrounding Ben Affleck but I can honestly say there's never been a point where I've disliked him. Personal preference, I guess, but the dude is a solid actor."
Order a drink for a girl and then drink it while she's not looking.
"I don't know how it was in the 80s, but when I was applying in 2003 you had to start in one of the satellite schools and after 2 years you could transfer to State College. 

My cousin went there, her graduating class was so big they didn't even read everyone's name, they just called the person at the beginning of each row to come up and collect the diplomas so they could pass them down."
"I'm a 2004 alum who lives 2.5 hrs away, probably not the best candidate."
"this is based on research, not education, there are a lot more universities than this that don't do a lot of research but does educate humanity."
[Imagus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imagus/immpkjjlgappgfkkfieppnmlhakdmaab?hl=en)...it opens and magnifies the pic/gif in a lil popup when you hover over it. Browsing reddit (on a deskstop) without it after having it is awful.
"I did business administration with a focus in marketing (3 year course). 

It surely opens your eyes to some ideas and practices in the real world that is often overlooked or ignored by most people. It also gives a lot of context into news stories you read and hear about about various company's goings on. 

I certainly enjoyed it and it added a lot to ""who I am"" but I LOVE business and got more out of it than some I'm sure."
It's good to use old stuff until it dies. I just wanted to make clear that this issue doesn't apply to current USB-C models.
Make sure your doggo (if you have any) doesnâ€™t sneak away with anything full of xylitol. Specially the gum. Gets em every time. Super toxic.
"> I second this...why are you using a package for basic native functionality?  I can't understand it.

Besides the point of people that aren't aware of fetch because they've been doing web dev for a long time(or perhaps new and never heard of it), so they stick with what they know. fetch doesn't work on node natively, you can use node-fetch package for it apparently, or you could use axios on either node/browser.

I've read in the past that fetch couldn't be used to get progress events (for file upload iirc), but with axios you could show the upload %. [In the past year](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16655112) fetch also wasn't able to cancel requests? If that's no longer the case, great, but if you were doing dev around then and tried fetch out and ran into that issue and axios solved it, that's probably why you'd stick to axios and not fetch.

It's not that common I think to make choices like that and then keep yourself up to date with all the other alternatives to see if you should reconsider, you just stick to what works well for you, and maybe if there is enough noise about an alternative at a later date you'd give it some thought."
"God I wish this show had gotten more recognition. Portia de Rossi was brilliant. Honestly, if any cancelled show deserves to be revived it's this one. I mean...you know veridian dynamics has some weird Lazarus device it could employ to revive itself. Creepy and extreme side effects be damned!"
That opening chapter with the surfer is just amazing.
"I think a delayed Mother's Day is in order.  It sounds like a wonderful tradition you two have and, except for the chocolate (though you can bring your own), there is no reason not to have a delayed celebration."

"Any brand name drawing pencil should be fine. Just avoid cheap pencils, since in order to make them cheap they put additives in the graphite mix that makes the graphite core brittle and waxy, making it difficult to sharpen and easy to break inside the wood. Just about any minor impact can break the core of a cheap pencil, and many are already broken inside the wood by the time you buy them."
