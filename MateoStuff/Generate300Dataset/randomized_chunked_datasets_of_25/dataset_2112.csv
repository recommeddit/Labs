58190,"Finally! A thread I can comment!! I was a fragrance model for a perfumer (yes, it -used- to be an actual profession) 

Every single fragrance changes with each person. You can't generalize what fragrance would fit all people WITH THE EXCEPTION of a linear fragrance. The difference being that it does not go through the ""three stages"". The top note, middle, bottom note. A linear fragrance stays the same. Look at Hanae Mori for Men or Chrome by Azzaro. It doesn't change and will do well no matter who wears it.  They are two of my personal favorites and have stood the test of time. 

If you don't have a budget: try Aventis by Creed ( also perfumed by the Same Fragrance family as Hanae Mori ) 

ENJOY!! 

Edit: holy crap guys. Yes!! This is my passion. 

Fragrances are based on different things. There is a spectrum of Fragrance( like a color) : water, earth, air, green, floral, oriental. Within each ""color"" of the spectrum there are similar base notes- Amber vs rose vs woods. 
Everything is planned from the color of the water to the bottle. Typically a water fragrance is blue, grassy or green fragrances  are green. 

Let me read through your questions. I have a chest cold right now and I'm up coughing. 



Edit two: 
A fragrance model doesn't have to be a model-model yes, however it is very prestigious and you must be asked by a fragrance house account manager to become one. You must show an aptitude for fragrance history, notes and understanding of the industry. I was a certified fragrance specialist too. I did it for about 6 years. I have a sensitive  olfactory. It's a blessing and a curse. I do have a gift of recommending and matching fragrances to what you may like. 

Tldr: tell me what you like. I'll tell you what you may also like. :) ( cologne) 

Edit : I am on an iPhone and I'm running a fever. ( can't smell ANYTHING it is actually very sad for me ) I will be back in the morning. I really hope I helped a lot of you. 

Thank you so much!! Please continue to ask me I will try to answer you all!!!!

That said, physics is just about the coolest thing for someone curious about how the universe works, and labs are super fun IMO.  I also happen to think physicists are a bunch of wonderful, interesting people.",best major to study in college

I kind of hate the new iPhone SE. I got one but it has no audio jack, it's too big, and the glass body is almost designed to break. The original iPhone SE was a perfect phone in every way. This phone is not a worthy successor. But it's okay.",best iPhone
