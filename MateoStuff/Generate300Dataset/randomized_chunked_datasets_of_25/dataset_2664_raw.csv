"Zealios v1s are my favorite, which sucks because they aren't made anymore! At least now I'm trying to move to something new, giving T1s and sakurios a try."
The main game I play is Clash Royale then I play Stardew valley and Minecraft when I have time to relax
"Yeah, it's got sugar, water, and... purple."

I saw Crying Game before there was any buzz about the twist. Thought I was seeing an IRA movie.
I see a lot of good suggestions here. You might also like some Heinlein-*Glory Road* & *Job:A Comedy of Justice* sort of fit.

This guy is amazing.
Love my LunarGlides. I've put about 200 miles on them so far and they feel AWESOME
"That clip gives me Tokyo Xtreme Racer vibes. Definitely going to have to keep an eye on this game, thanks!"
"Black books

Its a show about a bookshop owner with aspergers who hates running a shop"
I searched his name and I still can't find any place to actually buy his glasses.. Any additional help?
"We don’t bat an eye at prostitution or whatever goes on in the rooms as long as it doesn’t affect other guests. Half the women that come to the bar are working girls looking for a sale. The only thing that the hotel industry ever really reports is human trafficking. There are tell tale signs and if something doesn’t add up we do report it to local authorities. 

I don’t know about all 5* hotels but I’m sure this happens at most of them. Front desk/reservation staff will basically stalk you online if you’re a notable VIP and your picture will be shared internally to ensure everyone recognizes you so you feel special when you arrive and everyone already knows who you are."

Why don't you stay at an [extended stay hotel](http://homewoodsuites1.hilton.com/en_US/hw/index.do)? They have kitchens and everything. Designed for people who are going to be there for some time.
"I dunno, seems like a really niche distro /s"
They even have an automod to [rant about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/ombxqo/beginner_with_some_questions_upgrading_from/h5jvrg0/) when they're mentioned in an OP; it's actually kind of amusing.
"* Stardew Valley -- always going for multiple years
* Farm RPG (fun game, but love the dev and community. so addictive for people who like text based games)
*  Rainy Attic Room (story based, very slow--you are slowly helping a ""person"" in an attic),"
How do I get one of these wife things?
I'm still curious.
