9459,best toothpaste,"Hey, mom is a dentist. She mainly uses Sensodyne, but it really depends on the free samples given to them that month."
27383,best stocks to buy,"Well, my top 5 at this time are already in my portfolio…

1) GOOG - Absolutely dominant company that pretty much controls internet traffic. It has a moat that most will find hard to breach.

2) FB - Social media is too powerful today, and these guys run away from the competition in this department. I’ll be paying attention to the anti-trust battles, but until a competitor can legitimately challenge them, I’m not selling anything.

3) COST - In a world where e-commerce is overtaking traditional commerce, these guys aren’t going anywhere. Company is extremely well run, has a devoted fan base, and can increase their profits with the snap of a finger.

4) MSFT - Businesses run on Microsoft software. A few companies might switch, but all businesses? Unlikely.

5) V - Crypto may threaten them, but does anyone honestly believe that Visa is going anywhere in ten years? Credit and debit cards will still be used, and Visa will likely still be #1 or #2 in that department right alongside MasterCard.

The only reason I didn’t put AMZN on this list is that I got in at a price that, in hindsight, may have been too high. I’m looking for a run up on AMZN before earnings, selling, and waiting for the post-earnings drop to re-enter at a better price.

Three stocks I want to buy and hold for a long time but haven’t yet: ADBE (creativity runs through them now), MMM (industrial giant), and JNJ (stable with amazing dividends). I’m looking to snag them when they pull back to a fairer value; if they don’t, meh, bound to miss plenty."
9036,best toothpaste,I have a way with people.
73482,best battery bank,"2 x 10k mAh qc banks will take just about 4 hours to charge with a beefy 2 port wall plug. 2x 6.8oz plus at least 2.5oz plug for 16.1oz

A single 20k mAh power delivery 30W bank will charge in 3.5-4 hours. 12.8oz + 2.1oz for 14.9oz

So definitely not twice as fast. And the only 10k banks with power delivery that are out as of a month ago either weigh 11oz for 30W or take 3 hours to charge with 18W at about 7oz

The 40W 12k mAh PD bank that Huawei is coming out with is supposed to weigh around 9oz which may hit a sweet spot"
9155,best toothpaste,What toothpaste should I use then?
22087,best celebrity,Henry Winkler is the best!
32712,best vacation resort,"If you just want to stay in a resort, why even leave the country? You're not experiencing any other culture and probably limited to a few off-property excursions. That isn't traveling, it is touring."
36015,best alcoholic drink,I went out with some Polish people and they did this with vodka. It was not nearly so bad as I imagined it would be.
14432,best romantic novel,"Lol, yes we have! But it’s still awesome! That moment where they make eye contact, and she drops to the floor and then her brother comes in... I cackle every time I read it!! Then the dramatic reading of Miss Butterworth and the Mad Baron!! 

Did you know she’s developing a graphic novel of Miss Butterworth with her sister?? I want it SOOO BAD!"
10561,best suitcase lock,Saves you hauling 50 Lb around the airport i guess.
73433,best battery bank,"Anker is good stuff, and for me, 10k seems to be the right weight/capacity tradeoff, as it's similar in size to my phone.

One thing to watch for is making sure that the inputs and outputs match your needs to avoid carrying extra cables and to take advantage of any quick-charge capabilities your wall charger or phone may have. 

Also, in the age of USB-C, I encourage you to test everything at home. I've got at least one device that works fine using an A-C cable, but won't power up on a C-C cable."
4329,best text editor,"I haven't used it, but so far I haven't heard anything that makes me want to try the payware UltraEdit over Notepad++. What does the former do that the latter doesn't, or more importantly what does the former do *better* than the latter? I ask because I'm curious, not because I have some unhealthy devotion to a random software option.

> As to regular expressions...

In my experience regular expressions are always implemented slightly differently from program to program. I've never gotten used to ""one"" version, but AFAIK Notepad++ uses the basic, near-universal Perl syntax. At least, if it doesn't I've a) never noticed and b) never done something that made it obvious.

> Shell extensions are one area of the Windows world that I am happily mostly ignorant of, but Ultra-Edit integrates using a custom DLL. The integration Just Works, and that's good enough for me.

Notepad++, since it is the main alternative/competitor, does this as well. For future reference:

* In XP: Control Panel, Folder Options. Choose a file type and click Advanced. You can edit more entries to the list or change the default (usually Open or Edit if it is a text file).

* In Vista: Control Panel, Default Programs. I don't use it much so I can't give much more advice, but look in there and you'll probably find it."
60551,Best comedy show on Netflix,"If you want to try something different, I recommend the French comedy-drama, Call My Agent (Dix Per Cent).

Also, Broadchurch and Hinterland."
11353,best gifts for dad,"I know, right? I just had to make it all about me. 

Honestly, I wasn't thinking much about it (knew that I hadn't given up a hit, but was trying to just forget about it) until the next to last inning. Some dude rifled one to left that landed about 2 feet foul. I gave a big sigh and then heard my dad trying to calm me down. That's about when I put the gravity of the moment together.

Throwing strikes and getting people out is tough. It's WAY tougher when you're about to throw up from being so nervous."
56555,best desktop monitor,My 1060 6gb hits 70-80fps in FC5 and PUBG with mostly max settings and I’m only on a 4670. I’m at like 175 average in rocket league too.
