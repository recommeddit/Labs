32556,"We also went to Whitehouse. Everything was great, my only complaint is that the free snorkeling isn't very exciting and there were too few of the free sailboats, I always felt bad taking one out for too long...

Best advice on the food - you're in the Caribbean, they know how to make good Caribbean food. The American or attempts at exotic cuisine fell short of my expectations. The lamb chops were possibly the best I'd had, the goat curry was amazing, the jerk shack was awesome.

It's not the sandals I'd go to if I were into nightlife like clubs, etc. They have entertainment every night, and it's good but a bit hokey, but not like a real club or anything. Some odd the other resorts are better at this if you care. We liked how quiet and uncrowded this one was, though. We had a good 50 yards of beach to ourselves most every day. At the sandals we visited in montego bay, there were people packed into the small beach, and they sell day passes to anyone who wants in, lots of ""shell"" vendors. (The shells are usually stuffed with a gram or so of weed, which is illegal in Jamaica).",best vacation resort

68888,"My mistake, I thought you were talking about the Sad Puppies only and I thought they withdrew Reynolds's work from the lost after he asked them, but apparently they didn't.

But framing it as ""look at who the Puppies actually nominated, it's very similar to the popular stuff on this board"" is quite misleading - the Puppy leaders picked a few popular works from popular authors which already had a good chance of making it so they can pretend the point of the exercise wasn't to nominate works by the buddies of the organizers (or themselves in some cases) and some utterly mediocre works notable only for the politics of their authors. I don't see people on this sub recommending the likes of Larry Correia, Brad Torgersen and John C. Wright much. There is no ""heavy overlap"". The idea of the Puppy campaign was never to nominate the stuff the participants in the slate liked best, it was to piss off the ""SJWs"" and ""Libtards"" as much as possible and to promote Torgersen, Correia, Vox Dei and their friends.",best science fiction novel

If you are attending college your school's library may provide access to some things or you may be able to get something from a professor who has a subscription.  
  
Otherwise, google away and maybe check out the other websites people have mentioned.  
  
P.S.  
It may help to familiarize yourself with technical terminology and specific fields of study. Searching for ""computer science"" is too broad as compared to: artificial intelligence, machine learning, operating systems, cryptography, etc.",best research paper archive
