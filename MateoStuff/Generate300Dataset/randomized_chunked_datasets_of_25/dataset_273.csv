Monsterseed on PS1
Nier/Nier Automata 
I think lol"
56216,best action and adventure movie,Die Hard and Fury Road
43098,best detective show,"Seeing as how ABC had a show called Whodunnit, I'd go with that.  

r/whodunnit.  I really wish they'd kept this in production."
26639,best board games,"I am a HUGE fan of **Flashpoint: Fire Rescue** for a cooperative game.

**Lords of Waterdeep** is a lot of fun (Similarly, **Stone Age** is also very good)

**Ticket to Ride** blah blah best intro game ever.

**Coup** was my favorite game until I got too deep into Flashpoint."
70475,best major to study in college,My housemates are film students and they say word for word the same thing. That and apparently you don’t see all of your year group that often cos you’re stuck in small work groups most of the time.
68286,best science fiction novel,"We are all one, and one is all."
21317,best workout music,"You ready?!!! let's go!!!

That opening verse just makes me want to not stop."
32556,best vacation resort,"We also went to Whitehouse. Everything was great, my only complaint is that the free snorkeling isn't very exciting and there were too few of the free sailboats, I always felt bad taking one out for too long...

Best advice on the food - you're in the Caribbean, they know how to make good Caribbean food. The American or attempts at exotic cuisine fell short of my expectations. The lamb chops were possibly the best I'd had, the goat curry was amazing, the jerk shack was awesome.

It's not the sandals I'd go to if I were into nightlife like clubs, etc. They have entertainment every night, and it's good but a bit hokey, but not like a real club or anything. Some odd the other resorts are better at this if you care. We liked how quiet and uncrowded this one was, though. We had a good 50 yards of beach to ourselves most every day. At the sandals we visited in montego bay, there were people packed into the small beach, and they sell day passes to anyone who wants in, lots of ""shell"" vendors. (The shells are usually stuffed with a gram or so of weed, which is illegal in Jamaica)."
73618,best battery bank,What’s that roughly? I’m running photoshop and Lightroom so not exactly lightweight.
44002,best items under $100,"I bought a used 2DS, and then my boss bought one as well. Three more people have since gotten them and started bringing them to work. We take turns putting them all in a bag and walking around to catch people on streetpass.

Basically they are addictive and will take over your entire life, and the lives of everyone you know."
17048,best iOS game,"Dude, believe me. I've looked for a game like Device 6 many times but still nothing. Hope they make a sequel tho."
57972,best cologne,"It may be a bit corny, but I have a bottle of Adidas Sport cologne (no longer made) that has served me well.  Before that was regular Old Spice."
9488,best toothpaste,"Not a dentist, a hygienist. I use Prevident."
15147,best tree for the garden,"Well, pruning keeps things to the right size.

Of course, leylandii are very popular- we have some at the back- but you'll need to keep them aggressively pruned...."
68888,best science fiction novel,"My mistake, I thought you were talking about the Sad Puppies only and I thought they withdrew Reynolds's work from the lost after he asked them, but apparently they didn't.

But framing it as ""look at who the Puppies actually nominated, it's very similar to the popular stuff on this board"" is quite misleading - the Puppy leaders picked a few popular works from popular authors which already had a good chance of making it so they can pretend the point of the exercise wasn't to nominate works by the buddies of the organizers (or themselves in some cases) and some utterly mediocre works notable only for the politics of their authors. I don't see people on this sub recommending the likes of Larry Correia, Brad Torgersen and John C. Wright much. There is no ""heavy overlap"". The idea of the Puppy campaign was never to nominate the stuff the participants in the slate liked best, it was to piss off the ""SJWs"" and ""Libtards"" as much as possible and to promote Torgersen, Correia, Vox Dei and their friends."
62846,Best Data Science textbook,"There are a few of us out here. I just met up with a colleague recently to talk through some Bayesian Markov Chain models he's building at his new gig. It was super fun.  
I can tell you it's my go-to tool for doing any kind of statistical work. These days either home-rolled for simple cases or using PyMC3 for anything that isn't trivial."
20768,best workout music,"Coming Undone - Korn,
all of Led Zeppelin II,
Metallica"
32824,best free online grammar checker,Fiverr is how you make it hard for people who do this for a living to do this for a living.
51620,best iphone case,NOMAD rugged for iPhone 11 - had an Apple red leather for my XS max and it’s got this dirty looking gradient  on it.
68666,best science fiction novel,"Yeah. I felt like echopraxia was better written in a lot of ways, but it definitely didn’t carry the philosophical weight blindsight did."
72591,best keyboard switches,"Browns are my choice for general use and gaming.  After trying several types of switches, these will be the ones I buy for any future keyboards.  After using old membrane keyboards during my 8-12 hour days, it always puts a little smile on my face to get home and use mine

I like blues for prolonged typing (several pages or more at a time) and showing off

Reds, well, I just didn't care for them.  I dunno why, they just didn't feel like a mechanical keyboard to me.  Others may love them, and that's great, but they weren't for me"
6353,best Netflix documentary,I'd like to suggest Amend. It's a limited series with 6 episodes. It discusses the 14th amendment. It's....honestly it is just incredible.
50892,best rap album,"Madvillain - Madvillainy
Quasimoto - The Unseen
mHz - Table Scraps


I don't know. That's kind of a big question."
13957,best research paper archive,"The best place is probably a journal subscription.  
  
If you are attending college your school's library may provide access to some things or you may be able to get something from a professor who has a subscription.  
  
Otherwise, google away and maybe check out the other websites people have mentioned.  
  
P.S.  
It may help to familiarize yourself with technical terminology and specific fields of study. Searching for ""computer science"" is too broad as compared to: artificial intelligence, machine learning, operating systems, cryptography, etc."
38798,best web browser,"the thing is i love FF' UI both on android and windows, but it seems a bit slow on websites i use, i think they are optimized for chrominium

then Edge, windows version is fine, but android version sucks = ("
