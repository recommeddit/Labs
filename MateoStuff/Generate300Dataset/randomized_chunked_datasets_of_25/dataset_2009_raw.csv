I'm so pumped for it though... my fave villain of all time plus my favorite actor? I lost my shit when I found out Hardy was playing Venom... if it ends up awful it will definitely be from either shitty directing or writing (like Assassins Creed)
"[Cannon] - Plateau is the regional Telecomm/ISP here, and have pretty great coverage. They will be merging with AT&T though in about 6 months, plus AT&T will be putting up more towers in the surrounding area. So, if you will be PCS'ing here in that time frame, hold on to your AT&T device.

I used to be an astrophysics major then switched to psychology. I love everything about astrophysics except I wanted to work with kids and help them. I regret not pursing an astrophysics minor :/
"Thank you so much for the info and advice, i'll be sure to look into both finance and accounting. As for law, that'll have to wait but its definitely in the back of my mind. One more thing, school wise, it also matter where you attend if not for undergrad but for grad school due to networking/employers seeking for graduates from specific schools. Any info on that?"

[Persols](http://m.persol.com/usa/sunglasses/PO2803S/24-31) for me three. Classic Italian style that goes from t-shirt to tuxedo and insane quality.  They're heavy though.
