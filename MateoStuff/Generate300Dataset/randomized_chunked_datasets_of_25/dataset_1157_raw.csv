"I loved Key to the Kuffs, much more low fi then alot of DOOM's stuff, I thought JJ did a great job on there."
Axios is the best.
"My dad and I want to do this for my mom; did you find a website that does it? We have so many VHS tapes, I’m wondering how expensive it’ll be."
"Don’t judge but right now I love viva la juicy, the mix of jasmine and vanilla is so wonderful!"
"I was going to say this, as well. I have tried to buy cologne for my husband, but nothing smelled as good as he does naturally."
"Cannibal, got it."
"As someone who doesn't play esports games, OLED with 4K120 with VRR is the perfect as it gets but never been convinced that 48"" is usable on desktop environment. So I'm still holding out for 42"" OLED."
"Wow, libgen is pretty slick. Thanks for sharing!"
I love to listen to it while going through Grindr.
Thank you...I have seen the killing..I loved season 1 of the sinner hated season 2 thought they shoulda just kept it a mini series.
Very high praise.  I'll return to it next week.  I hope it's as good as advertised!
"A lot of people here don't consider witcher 3 an rpg, its more of an action adventure game. Closer to something like red dead redemption or far cry than Baldur's gate or final fantasy."
"Full spa afternoon.  Mannie, Peddie and Massage."
I loved playing the trumpet and baritone.
"Jimmy Choo Stars Edition.  It's so nice.  It was a limited release, so I only use it on special occasions now."
"TBH, OP added a comment after I replied clarifying what he/she is seeking. 

I answered considering the question asked about ""cities"" and NYC tourism is based on being outdoors - Times Square, Liberty Island, walking the city, Central Park, etc."
"Well, it can earn its keep!
Be a tax write off.

depends on what time of day you're eating breakfast.
"I’m honestly not getting all this opinion-hating on the fact that some, me included, think that BP is overrated. What’s wrong with sharing a thought? This sub is kind of for that.
And the fact that is a “crowd” of people saying that, must be for a reason, imo."
"Some people are simply born with mouths that start less acidic than most, and that return to a non-acidic pH faster after eating. In addition, the bacteria in people's mouths are different, so you might be less prone to cavities than most in the first place.

Basically, your mouth is just a genetically healthy mouth. There are some people who brush 4 times a day, look at a cupcake, and get 5 cavities."
"If I'm being 2016, I would never fuck with Aquafina. That is like the coke of bottled water. 

Poland spring is a normal go-to. Doesn't everyone like poland spring?"
"I think it would be worth it to at least evaluate Drupal Commons.  It is a pretty complete social networking framework.  To use it for the final product probably involved little custom code, but mainly turning off a lot of features you don't need or want.  (Simpler is better).

If you at least install it and play around, I think it will give you some context in figuring out the path forward.  If this were my project I would install and check out a few different pre-rolled applications, Drupal Commons, BuddyPress, reddit, maybe slashcode, and take notes on each.  In the conference presentation I would include a short comparison slide, and explain what pushed you to whatever route you end up taking.

One factor that would push me towards Drupal Commons is the future maintenance and longevity of the project.  If it succeeds as a social networking site, there will be a lot of people who will be upset if it falls out of maintenance and dies.  Passing off your own custom code to a future owner has challenges.  Of course passing off Drupal to them might have challenges too.  An analysis of the options would be good as a small part of your presentation."
"List of celebrities nobody hates: Keanu Reeves, Tom Hanks, Terry Crews, Robin Williams."
