Recommend a film? I've seen A Wednesday."
LF cus I like it and I've got my config all set up.
"When I was 5 years old I was running down a hotel lobby in Miami until I crashed into JayZ’s legs.

From my fathers perspective he said JayZ laughed it off and continued his walk down the lobby."
I feel like a lot of people forgot that slowthais record dropped this year. Tbh that’s prob my favorite just as of right now.
"K-on at #29, fuck yeah!

Watched 5 of the top 10  
32 out of top 100

Less than I'd like but I know about most of them. Great list."
"Best - Full sized candy bars *(whatever)*


Worst - Cans of peas from my next door neighbor *(fuckers)*"
"I have a smart TV, but it doesn't support Amazon Instant, and it looks like Chromecast doesn't either, so I'm not sure if it would be a good fit. Roku does, however, so that's a big plus."
if it was jack johnson his post would probably be written in all the most annoying to play bar chords ever. somehow.
"I love the iPhone 5s. The size, the design, everything was just perfect!"
"Dick Van Dyke. I met him while doing a performance for Disney's Candlelight at Disneyland one year. He was super nice and talked to everyone who asked him questions. He told us all about his past career and how much he enjoyed talking to people who enjoyed his films. He was super polite, told great jokes, and he listened to all the things people had to say about him. 

Not like Mickey Rooney the year before. That guy was a prick."
"The Sinner. The perfect binge watching show. Every episode they give you a little more information on the crime and you just HAVE to watch the next episode to hear what plays out. Bill Pullman is phenomenal as the fucked up, retired cop who just can't retire."
"United 06-09 > United 98-01 

I prefer this [list](http://footballpantheon.com/2011/05/the-50-greatest-european-club-sides/11/). It's better researched. Although do bare in mind it's from 2011."
"Ah, I’m new to the hobby and did not know that SU&SD had preference towards player interaction and against “multiplayer solitaire.” This should be helpful when watching their videos moving forward."
Can't beat a gin and tonic.
"It was recommended from a jailbreaker to added to the list . I have YouTubeReborn . I’ll install perfectYouTube and report back

Edit : it’s not working."
"What’s TSP?

Would keeping to a beige/off white trend be too generic? I’ve only lived in rentals so the walls have always been white.

Floor will be darker wood laminate throughout since I’ll have pets and want to avoid smells for the same reason there are smells now."
"Ritz Carlton. My dad had been booked in one of their rooms by his new company for a training seminar when I was a kid. Our family went on the trip and we pulled in about 11pm after driving for hours.  The concierge checked the computer, blanched and started apologizing profusely, saying our room had been double booked and the other people were already there.  He went away for a few minutes, then the manager came back and said ""we only have one room left tonight, if you'll come with me I will show it to you and you may have it for free if you approve.""  

We figured it was gonna be a broom closet in the basement, and would've been happy to take it, but instead the elevator went up and up and when we reached the top floor, he led us all the way down the hall.  When we got to the end, we saw two gorgeous wooden and brass doors.  I remember my parents looking at each other with big eyes, but just then he opened the doors and flipped the lights, and we gazed upon a Steinway concert grand parked under a crystal chandelier, in the living room of the Presidential Penthouse Suite.  There was also a dining room, breakfast room, full kitchen, separate bedroom and two bathrooms. The only downside was the very faint whiff of fresh paint, since Motley Crue had stayed there the previous week (this was the 80s, in their guitar-smashing heyday.)

&#x200B;

The service was really impeccable though, 10/10 would stay again if I could afford it.  They treated us ragamuffins from the sticks like we were royalty. Also, I loved playing the piano so it was super-fun to attack my practice sessions on a) a baroque-style Steinway and b) the same piano Elton John and a bunch of others had played on."
Seems like they just threw some good albums into a list in the most disorganized order possible.
Marc Maron's latest is hysterical.
I use it on Linux and it is just phenomenal
"You’re right. I don’t have facts and sources that `axios` is not dead. I’m just trying to point out that it seems to be really widely used even in new projects, taught in boot camps, and I can’t speak on the quality of commits, but they seem to be still coming in even for a pretty mature library. I am just skeptical that `axios` is “mostly dead” just like this sub was claiming `redux` is supposedly dead too."
