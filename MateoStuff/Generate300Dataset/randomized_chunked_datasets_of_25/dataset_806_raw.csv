"I got my current job through LinkedIn. I was skeptical of it for *ages* because it seemed like a boring, self-aggrandizing Facebook that spammed your contacts, but it really is great for connecting with people, and for being visible to people who are looking.

I found the job listing on LinkedIn, applied using my LinkedIn profile, and then I noticed the internal recruiter who had posted the listing was connected to a former colleague of mine‚ÄîI emailed him and he said he'd gone to college with the recruiter, then shot her an email to recommend me. Boom, hired. I'm not saying it's the only way I could have gotten it, but it definitely helped."
If your goal is to be a professionnal you should also check job offers in your country.
"I am 100% sure that it is configured correctly, however I cannot perceive any difference, either visually or via input latency.

The only way I can see the difference is to record moving my mouse rapidly between my two screens (other one is 60Hz) in slow-mo with my phone."

"I'm sorry! He would have laughed and said,""you're okay. It's too far from your heart to kill you.""

It's pretty damn close sometimes, you know ?"
"Tom Hanks. 

Was at a friends wedding at the Wynn in Las Vegas and were taking pictures in the Atrium (also the VIP Entrance). He emerged from the double doors behind our group and said ""Hey! Is this a wedding? Can I be in the pictures?"" Everyone was quite pissed off until we realized it was Tom-Fucking-Hanks.

He took pictures with the whole group and was a general all around great guy.

"You can also use this [textbook search engine](https://courseherounlocker.com/wp/free-textbooks/) which makes it easy to find most textbooks. It does not index libgen (Google's fault), so you can check both."
"Kendall tries way too hard to seem kinda alternative/artsy/elegant and it all seems like such an act. Like I remember seeing her post a pic of an easel and I was like yeah of course üôÑ

I usually wouldn‚Äôt call someone a ‚Äúfake stoner‚Äù because I don‚Äôt think smoking weed is impressive or a personality trait lol but I get what you‚Äôre saying here."

"I had the iPhone 4s. It was a great phone when it came out, but I feel Apple pushed the software updates too far. By the time I upgraded, the iPhone 4s was slow to the point of unusable. 

The best iPhone in my opinion is the iPhone 11. It mixes good specs and a good price."
"Right? All these other guys are like calculus/linear algebra/diffyQ etc. Like no shit, everyone at my school takes those. CS also as algorithms/discrete math/combinatorics/prob&stats, maybe some relational algebra, lots and lots of stuff."
"I have the LG panel you're looking at and love it. The HDR on it isn't aassss impressive as others I've seen, but HDR on windows is a broken pile of junk anyway sooooo yeah. Very crisp nanocell IPS panel, 144, 1440p, and freesync/gsync. I can never go back to anything less"
"Well if you're very  competitive fps and fighting gamer then yeah it help. But for AAA games, it almost useless"
I currently have an 11 Pro Max with a Pitaka case and love it! Although I read that they changed their case slightly for the 12 and the edges around the screen are super sharp. I hope that‚Äôs not the case for the iPhone 13 also. I ordered a 13 Pro Max.
"It‚Äôs a Stephen King book adaptation, James Franco goes back in time to prevent the assassination of John F Kennedy, sounds more cheesy than it actually is ;)"
My Mom's mom (grandmother passed away) and there is a pie recipe she makes every Christmas and Thanksgiving from her mom that she worked years to replicate. So a custom recipe art print from Etsy that she can hang in her kitchen of the pie recipe so she can always be reminded of her mom.
