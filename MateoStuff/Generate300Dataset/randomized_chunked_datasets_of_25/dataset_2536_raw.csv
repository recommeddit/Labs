I think the ESR matte protectors with slight paper like feel are the best for me. I have tried them all including paper like v1 and 2's but currently switching between glass and ESR every couple of months. Paper like is like 35 bucks for 2 and the texture wears down over time so its up to you if you think its worth it.
"If you like that, watch the [behind the scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C3HkgpKJp8&list=UU4VppoOwM5DzVHKWx5RJiCg) too! The 'reveal' at the end is great!"
It shows how meaningless the specific rankings really are.
"I'm going to go with series and I'm going to limit them to a specific thematic area. 

* Troy Rising by David Drake, especially the first two. The third book is okay but not as good as the earlier ones.  The series is marred by a lack of a fourth book.   

* Kris Longknife by Mike Shepherd. These are all fairly formulaic, but they are a good formulaic for most part, and they have some excellent bad guys. If you like any of the Honor Harrington series, you will probably like these. Unless you have a fondness for Weber's extended exposition, which does not show up here.   

* Vatta's War by Elizabeth Moon.   

* Gunnery Sergeant Torin Kerr by Tanya Huff.   

* Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell."
"Yes it's large (landmass), small (population), and expensive because of its isolation. I understand, I've lived in the Northern Hemisphere too, when you are used to the relative ease of travel and the relative cheapness/bounty of goods it's a hell of an adjustment to NZ and its little economy."
"Not sure what if it can do it now. It wasn't been able to do it in clean way earlier like 8 months ago. And obvious option was Axios. If had to do something new ground up, I would maybe check it. However, I'm doubtful it's on par, though."
"Well we loved Portland, Maine the Wife & I but a little pricey. Rents were hovering around $1500 and homes around $250K. Trying to find something similar and a little less steep in price. We probably be making about $100K the Wife and I combined so might be doable. The snow is also a concerned think we could handle it but would prefer a City with less snow than CT.

Looking for a City that could be on or close to the Ocean or at least an hour drive away Has university or multiple higher ed facilities Decent size hospital Close to mountains and areas to hike Running and outdoor groups Places to kayak and camp near by Museum or two Good restaurants Areas to shop an possibly an outlet mall nearby Within an hour leave the urban life for the rural life."

This sounds like such a headache on so many levels. Red dining room? Orange living room? Christ I already feel a migraine coming on.
"$26.25 after taxes for air Canada, $50 for a second bag, and then $100 for a third, with a $50 or $100 overweight fee for things over 70 pounds. Yeah it's most likely cheaper to cargo ship it"
"Maybe that's because the teams that won the most European trophies are also generally the most successful domestically, and had the best players and managers?

In any case, people who think that Barcelona weren't a major club pre-1992 (because they only won 6 European trophies until then) should take the time to read about László Kubala, Helenio Herrera, Luis Suárez Miramontes, Sándor Kocsis, Johan Cruijff, Rinus Michels, Udo Lattek, and Diego Maradona..."
Fake reviews are out of control. Last vacation I took I picked a few that looked good and then reddit came through. Asked to compare a few and found people that stayed there which was good enough for me. Stayed at the rendezvous couples resort in st Lucia. Think its theromanticholiday.com or some shit that place was cool as shit
"The Ajax squad in 1965-1973 was incredible with Cruyff, Suurbier, Vasović, Swart and Keizer. 

Also the milan side 87-94 deserves a mention with the likes of Van Basten, Baresi, Rijkaard, Donadoni, Maldini, Tassotti and Ruud Gullit."
Forever war is good! Really like the way it tells how meaningless war is.

">Gulf war - unjustified because Iraq asked us our opinion before the invasion and instead of putting our foot down we gave saddam an answer vague enough for him to feel comfortable to invade.

This is a much-repeated thing, but it's misleading. It's based almost entirely on this transcription of a meeting between an American diplomat (Glaspie) and President Saddam Hussein. Here is the relevant passage:

>GLASPIE: I think I understand this. I have lived here for years. I admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country. I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. **But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.**
>    
>    I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60's. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America. James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. **We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak.** All that we hope is that these issues are solved quickly. With regard to all of this, can I ask you to see how the issue appears to us?

It is clear that an invasion is not on the table here, and that the United States does not want to get involved in negotiations over an OPEC dispute directly, and want it dealt with peacefully and diplomatically via another Arab party.

From a [1990 Wikileaks message](http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/1990/07/90BAGHDAD4237.html#) detailing the same meeting:

    ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE EXPLICIT, SADDAM'S MESSAGE
    TO US SEEMED TO BE THAT HE WILL MAKE A MAJOR PUSH
    TO COOPERATE WITH MUBARAK'S DIPLOMACY, BUT WE MUST
    TRY TO UNDERSTAND KUWAITI/UAE ""SELFISHNESS"" IS
    UNBEARABLE. AMBASSADOR MADE CLEAR THAT WE CAN
    NEVER EXCUSE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY OTHER THAN
    PEACEFUL MEANS. END SUMMARY.

Note the second-to-last sentence. Furthermore, throughout the summary of the meeting it is clear that Saddam Hussein is well aware that his aggression could spark a US Government response. Iraq was trying to judge our willingness to intervene, we gave a pat answer about not wanting to get involve in inter-Arab border conflicts -- Iraq judged that answer incorrectly, and thought it meant a full-scale invasion and resource takeover was okay (when really what it meant was we didn't want to get involved in OPEC's conflict resolution process). ""Oops""."
"Yes, I think in general we should be pushing for more technical content from articles that talk about usb-c. I don't want to hear anymore garbage about how usb-c is this sort of magic cable. I want to hear about how well implemented the device or cable is, measurements of the device/cable, maybe even what materials it's composed of."
