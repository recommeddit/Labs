For sure an option. Just seeing if there something out there I wasn't aware of that would keep all the calendars in their own world's and pull everything into one place.
Can you comment on Grider?
"Uruguay has more World Cups than France, Spain and England"
Gotta go With Raiders of The Lost Ark and Monty Python and The Holy Grail. Probably the movies I've seen the most and I always love watching them.
Same issue with natural sunlight.  I find myself having to reset it a lot as the lighting changes in my streaming space (my bedroom which has 5 windows)
I agree it's great but it's one of the most mentioned games on Reddit.
"""...*how fucked up the main characters were (+ambiguous morality) and how dark and grim it was"".* You should watch the french series Braquo"
A good vibrator.
"I cannot recommend this method enough.  

It sounds like one of those bogus life hacks that don't really work.  But the results are amazing."
"Apple cables really suck, but I never had problems with USB-C cables

If OP wants one, I’ve been using a Phillips one for months and it works super well while being super cheap"
First book seemed to be the best.  You can stop there IIRC
"Depends on your municipality. If you lived in Flint you wouldn't be saying that.

But it personally angers me a great deal that tap water standards are so poor in many parts of the country. Safe drinking water should be an absolute guarantee in a country this wealthy. Resorting to bottled water is absurd."
"Holland and Maguire are both great, and Garfield is the Yamcha of Spider-men."
I hadn't even realized there was an Erased hate train lol. I've pretty much only heard positive things about it
"Another vote for gl850 from me. I got one as my main monitor, loved it. Then I got one to replace my second screen so they matched, then there was a sale and I got a third for my gf work from WFH setup, one day I'll steal it for a triple setup."
"Yes!! Reading the second trilogy now AGAIN. I second the amazing world building, and if you’re a history, geography, mythology fan, these books are for you! I love them all dearly. She also has the Santa Olivia series. Futuristic sci fi romance (kinda?) and very different from the Kushiel series. Off the top of my head I can think of six people that I’ve shared Carey with and they all love her work."
"Thank you so much for a great advice. Btw, why did you switch from paperlike to iCarez? Any idea how long paperlike lasts :)"
Joey Ramone was super sweet and polite. He seemed like such a nice boy.
"I started watching Gilmore Girls with my wife and I have been pleasantly surprised with how much I like it. Would never in a million years have checked it out myself because it seemed... whatever the exact opposite of ""up my alley"" is."
"I drink them, but not as often as I used to. I have energy drinks less than I drink soda. If I am driving somewhere for more than 3 or 4 hours I usually drink one throughout the first hour(then switch to water). If I have to be up very late for some reason I'll drink one then as well. When I worked third shift I used to drink them more frequently, but I found that I don't really need them if I keep a regular schedule as much as possible, eat healthier and be more active, and now see them more as a mixer than something to keep me awake."
"If you pay for a digital subscription, you'll get rid of all or most of the ads, so that's a non-issue. I subscribe to NYT and the number of ads seems much less than in my local print paper."
lol
"Hire a team of 5-10 strong linux developers. This should help you in basing your in-house distro on an external distro like debian,gentoo,arch etc.. This holds more water when you have your own package manager and custom deployment mechanisms. This should help you in the long term as well."
First time I used one it was a girl's house and she let me use it. As it popped my back loudly it also pushed out a really loud fart. She looked at me like I just murdered someone.
"Met Keegan Michael Key backstage before a show once. I complemented him on his (at the time) new series. He took my one hand with both of his hands, asked my name, and gave the sincerest thank you. Such a nice guy.

On the rude side, Mariah Carey is a bitch. Talked about how much she loved her dog so much and ended up leaving it backstage after the show."
