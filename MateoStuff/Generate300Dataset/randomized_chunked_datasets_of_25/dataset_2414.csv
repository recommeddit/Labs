2572,best headphones,If you can go over that budget settle for something like Sennheiser HD800s[HD800s](https://intoptrend.com/best-headphones-reddit-2021/). These are better sounding headphones and for sure you can gain a lot more if you are using an amp.

47987,best color to paint with,"> Now I keep most walls neutral or light/subtle, and let artwork, furniture, etc. have the overwhelming colours.

6469,best Netflix documentary,"I have heard praise for this film endlessly. I don't doubt that it is a good film, but I feel like I have seen enough drug documentaries in my life - quite a few about the 80's cocaine subject. On the other hand, I am pretty curious as to why this film seems to stand head and shoulders above the rest. I'm sure it will hold my attention, and that I will probably end  up enjoying it, I just can't seem to ever press play on it."

32153,best hotel to live in,"The Hilton in Chicago.  It was lovely, the staff was considerate, professional and accommodating.  It may very well be a small thing but for the first time in my life I sent out dry cleaning. I received the item back first thing the next morning and I felt extremely spoiled.  I might be confusing two hotels but I think they gave us cookies at the front desk also. I was traveling a great deal between Dallas, Chicago and New York at the time so I may have the cookies confused.  Either way I felt like a queen."
