3080,best webcamera,"game streamers usually have the webcams as a tiny portion of the output, quality doesnt really matter that much (most stream at 900-1080p) as long as the colours are not absolute garbage.

irl streamers already use cameras or phones so it doesnt really affect them?"

25038,best spiderman actor,The dance was such a weird choice.  I know Sam likes his comedy but that was a bit much.
65325,best phone service company,"So, I'm about to buy a phone this black Friday, and would really like to get out of a contract when I barely use all the services.
Uh any suggestions?"
22848,best celebrity,"When Joe Biden was a Senator I accidentally walked in on him while he was in the stall of an Amtrak bathroom. He sat there awkwardly for a second and then said ""I'd shake your hand but I don't think either of us want that."""
55618,best action and adventure novel series,"Check out the Emaneska Series by Ben Galley. 

The first two are :
[The Written](http://www.amazon.com/The-Written-Emaneska-Series-ebook/dp/B005ELJOY8/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1374471147&sr=1-1)

If you have a kindle or the kindle app for phone, you can get the first book for free. The other 3 in the series are $3.99-$4.99 each."
22989,best celebrity,"Yeah, but that was also TMZ not knowing that pro wrestling is really, really, really progressive with gay issues- there's usually at least one gay worker in each locker room, and virtually no one has a problem with that (and if they do, they usually get weeded out quickly.)"
41016,best instrument to play,"Kalimba. Most only use diatonic notes so you can pretty much randomly move your thumbs around and it’ll sound fine. Accidentally hit two notes next to each other? They’re all a third apart, so that’s fine too. You can also get them in pentatonic tunings for even less chance to sound weird."
55600,best action and adventure novel series,Don't let the size of the book sway you.  I know it is big.  But Think of it as a gift that keeps giving.  Goodkind is a master storyteller.  He weaves everything together so well.  Things happen in first book that play out in third.  Etc.     he takes you on a emotional journey. Helping you form a bond with the characters.  This is by far the best book/series I have ever read. It revolves around a epic love story.    I had a friend who only reads crime dramas.  Tell me they would read first rule if i read a book they liked.   They finished it and continued to read the whole series.  This is someone that never reads fantasy at all.   Read the first book only if your prepared to be sucked into the whole series.    Let me know what you think of it.   Also most library's  carry this book/ series at least near me.
11161,best backpack for college,"I've been looking at the duluth packs.  I like the look of the scout packs, but I wonder how comfortable the web straps are (I carry 30-40lb of stuff a mile and a half or so over the course of a day)"

39722,best podcast for biologists,"I saw that episode and was wondering if it was a crazy coincidence or not haha. I was curious because lymphoma is the cancer I had in my teens (~10 years ago), and I'm now also involved in cancer research (but on the medical physics side of things; radiation interaction with tissue for diagnostics/therapy). I've read up on what I could of this cancer from my own field, but would love the expert bio descriptions. Looking forward to listening, thanks!"
24104,best anime,"I will skip the childish ecchi anime genre, F cup boobs on skinny girls. pretentiousness,  and school drama nonsense. These are shows that will leave you sitting , feeling empty once you've finished them even if you don't like cartoons-
