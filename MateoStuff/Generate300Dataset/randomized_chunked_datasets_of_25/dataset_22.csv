4877,best home improvement store,I never find what I’m looking for in HD. They always have the more expensive version of what I’m looking for.   It pisses me off. For this reason alone I stopped going to HD.
22018,best celebrity,"Scarlett Johansson back in 2011 at a Starbucks. 

Super sweet and really bubbly. Thought she would come across as a bitch or standoffish, partly because it was early in the morning, like 5:30-6:00 am. Not at all, she was so nice. Made her laugh after I told her I was a huge fan of one of her earliest films, Home Alone 3 (which really is one of my favorite childhood movies). 

She just had this charming aura about her."

25591,best cricket teams of all time,"I'm fairly confused and feel like I need to see key results during each time period to see whether this is accurate. However, people here seem to be impressed so I think you've done well. In recent times it seems alright with NZ being 3rd in Tests and England being 6th. How did South Africa manage to fall so far down in ODIs between 2010 and 2013?"

32260,best hotel to live in,"Didn’t work at one, but delivered newspapers to one. 

The prostitution thing was something the desk saw a lot. The best one was when the gentlemen got robbed by two young ladies and immediately demanded the front desk call the cops. When the desk asked if he wanted to call the cops and tell them he hired two hookers (illegal)... he suddenly just grunted and marched up to his room."
