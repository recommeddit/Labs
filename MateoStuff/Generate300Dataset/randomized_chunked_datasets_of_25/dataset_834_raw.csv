"Mostly because it will damage gums more than teeth.
Also consider what is happening when you brush really hard. You're brushing with the middle part of the bristle, as you're bending it over, which isn't going to clean as well as the ends of the bristles."
"I haven't looked at powerbank options lately, so I'm not going to be much help other than to say that you have my upvote for the detailed post of what you've considered."
"I write in Word and edit in Google Docs and the Hemingway App, all three of which have slightly different grammar algorithms from what I can tell. By the time I finish my edits there doesn't seem to be many mistakes slipping through."
"My fave color is BM gray owl. I asked them to cut it by 25% and I adore it.   It’s in my kitchen which is a north facing room that gets some light. Repose gray looks really good in my dining room which is a south facing room and light floods it. I have a two story, north facing  living room but it has sliding glass doors at bottom and a second set of windows up top so a decent amount of light. Since it’s such an expanse to be one color I tried to go with something that would fit all that and collinwood gray does a great job. The entry is south facing so a ton of light and the collinwood looks good there also. Pinterest is a great source to start with."
Wait what's breakfast?

What works for me more surprisingly is a subperceptual to threshold dose of psilocybin mushrooms"

This looks amazing.
VW really have done a great job
"I am late to this thread and maybe this has been covered, but there is an important t distinction to be made in looking at political preference and newspapers, namely, editorial versus reporting.  The editorial page of a paper will always be slanted.  The news reporting shouldn't be, and the news editors of most major American papers do a good job of this.  

USA Today is the most middle of the road of all papers, but it's written on a fourth grade reading level in the print news edition, and that can only take you so far in limited space."
He only had himself to blame.
"One of the male marketed products that is superior though is men's razors. I know women that swear by men's razors, both because they're higher quality and lower in price."
Just not worth it's cost.
Richard K. Morgan's A Land Fit for Heroes is under-appreciated in my opinion. It's as weird as but not quite as complex as Malazan. R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing might have some of what you're looking for.
"It's based on Chromium lmao. It's Chrome with an inbuilt ad-blocker and shitty cryptomining business. And from your post history, I know that its value is lesser than Bitcoin and other proper crypto coins. [It is very shady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)#Controversies)."

Mos Def & Talib Kweli - Black Star

Company Flow - Funcrusher Plus

Little Brother - Minstrel Show/The Listening (both are just as good but only 1 is sometimes hailed as a classic)"
"Then why would you use Ace rub for a city tree when it's not gonna reach maturity? There are plenty other good options. Carpinus caroliana's fall colour is comparable, and a 50yo Ace rub is gonna be around the same height and spread as Car car at the same age."
"We’ve stayed at every resort multiple times (except for sapphire falls) and we adore the Hard Rock. From the proximity to the parks to the best pool on site, along with an amazing staff, it’s almost impossible to beat the experience."
