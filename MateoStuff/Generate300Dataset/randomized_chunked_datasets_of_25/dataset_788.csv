25599,"Sure, but the code is not commented and it's far from well written. I am not sure if you would prefer to see the current format or wait to see a well written format in the coming weeks. If you want a peak though, I create a matrix where the rows and columns represent teams. The entries are state how each team is doing against the other. The rankings is then derived from the eigenvalue decomposition. The rest of it is just making the rank between 0 and 100 for aesthetics.",best cricket teams of all time

32226,"NEVER EVER EVER (I REPEAT!!) USE A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN FROM A HOTEL OR BANQUET HALL!!!

Picture this: it’s an expensive ass Sunday brunch. Well little Timmy just double fisted strawberries directly into that chocolate, bit into both strawberries then triple dipped into the chocolate AGAIN! And some old rich lady just sneezed on it. And somebody else just dropped their snack into it. The best part: that chocolate gets strained and saved for the next weeks brunch. Chocolate is waaay too expensive to throw away.

Chocolate also does this thing where it’ll seize if it has the wrong moisture content (from people dipping fruit, and the juices going into the chocolate.) So it’ll get so thick it won’t run through the machine. Wanna know how they fix that? They add canola oil until it’s smooth again.

So, yeah, next time you’re at a wedding and they have a chocolate fountain, think of this post. Think of this post when you dip into that dirty ass watered down with oil chocolate.

62478,"I'd say more like action-RPG. The RPG elements are rather important and core to the gameplay. It's like the main factor. It is heavy stat-oriented and you can customize your character in many ways. 

I'd consider games like Horizon Zero Dawn and AC Odyssey Action-Adventures with RPG mechanics since they have some RPG mechanics but it's pretty barebones. While Dark Souls's RPG mechanic is much more heavy and prominent.
