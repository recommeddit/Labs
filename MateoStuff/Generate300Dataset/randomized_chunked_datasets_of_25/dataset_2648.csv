Buckling springs are something I'd only suggest if you are a heavy typer (this is for the first-timers after all). Personally I also think this chart too easily tells gamers to get a linear switch. At first when I tried out a mx black board, none of my friends could see why gamers would even consider something like that. Of course, that's just me and my friends (more than ten people total) who all currently use rubber domes. It might just need time to adapt to that, but all in all I did find it a bit weird that it was so universally hated in that group.",best keyboard switches
