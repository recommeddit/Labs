37063,best roller coaster at six flags,"Putting grass under a coaster instead of concrete is still not themeing it. Have a look at Black Mamba (Phantasialand) or Blue Fire (Europapark). That is themeing! The coaster diving into dips and through caves, winding through the African desert like a snake or flashing through the scarce and rocky landscape of Iceland."

I’ll pick up other brands if they’re discounted, but I’m not paying that much for shoes that look like shit.
