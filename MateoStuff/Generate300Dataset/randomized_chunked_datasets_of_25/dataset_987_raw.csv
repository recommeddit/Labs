the best major is one where you can best apply yourself
"I certainly don't read cover to cover. Just the lead stories, US, some Europe, and countries that are in the news as well as science and technology and whatever special they're doing."
"It doesn't matter what you do.  You see that kid half paying attention over there?  Yeah, his uncle is going to get him a job right out of college that pays more than you'll be making even 10 years from now."
Got a recipe?
"As Space Opera its O.K. 

As a Culture novel, its comparatively substandard.

The Hydrogen Sonata was much better and more action packed. Some of the fights, characters and settings in that book will blow you away."
"When you consider self service BI aspect of Excel (Power Query, PowerPivot using DAX etc). Yeah, as spreadsheet software, it's about the only option. With it's general availability and wide spread use, there are many free tools that extends it's ability as well (OpenSolver, Analysis Tool pack, etc).

Excluding that part, Google Sheet is tad behind, but not by much. They were ahead in some aspects, before introduction of new array behavior by MS in Office 365.

And I love the cloud integration part of Office 365 suites. With single API (Graph) that allows you to connect and interact with various parts of ecosystem (SharePoint, Teams, Planner, Excel  etc)"
"That's a *little bit* disingenuous though. TO was not a household name until 1998 when he put up 14(?) TDs. Brown was also in the tail end of his career (though I guess you can sort of compare that with Carter). Moss also had Welker, maybe the best slot receiver ever (and Moss was the main part of the two highest scoring offenses of the time).

those early 49ers years also benefitted from the new WCO, which I'd argue did the heavy lifting for many of those players.

Either way, I find it hard to argue that HoF QBs don't benefit WRs. Sure, they're better at spreading the ball around, but they also allow WRs to do more. It certainly works both ways, and there's definitely cases that would support both sides of the argument. I wonder if there's some definitive research around the topic."
"FYI, you can report non working sites to https://webcompat.com/ -- developers will diagnose the issue and work to fix the Firefox issue or contact the site developers."
"axios-retry broke after axios 0.19.0. It took months before axios was updated with a fix. When youâ€™re trying to continuously deploy and your company doesnâ€™t allow you to deploy and code that depends on vulnerable packages, thatâ€™s too long of a wait."
"Usually the one I'm using right now. Which is manjaro atm and I'm loving it, steam working out of the box was a huge win after the last linux foray a year ago with ubuntu."
How?
"""Extended Stay America"" is good for, well, America.   Last one I stayed at was just outside of Vegas. Definitely worth the price.  Basically a hotel suite at motel prices."
"Wow. There are many things you could call Sulla... not sure ""hero"" is one of them though."
What's a toothbrush trade show like? I love discovering the existence of these ultra-specific events you would never consider.
"Haha.. its not a toothbrush trade show, more like a dental trade show. Colgate and Oral B always rock up, more to give dentists information on the science before their new products than actually selling a product, their market is the mass market and dentists are the ones who advise the public on what to use. For us, this is a very minor part of the trade show. Other companies like Sirona, Dentsupply, Henry Scheil Halas, GC, ivoclar sell dental equipment and materials (think dental chairs, sterilizers, lasers, filling materials, crown and bridge materials etc) are always there to showcase their new products and generally have some sort of trade show discount. These are the ones we are more interested in to be honest, but its worth going to colgate/oral b for a few minutes just to update ourself on the latest products. Other companies like practice management companies, finance companies aiming for the healthcare market etc normally have booths too."

"Skol!  It was $9.99 for a 1.75L in High School, and it's still the same price 12 years later.  I'm not a vodka drinker, but if I am going to have some, I'm not gonna waste my $ on the good stuff."
"They're cherry flavored, which is like the worst fruit flavor. Also the texture sucks."
Zealios have a more jarring bump and the one for the Pandas is more rounded if that helps.
Universal also has the Harry Potter ride now! Itâ€™s like the Mummy one but even bigger. Thereâ€™s also a small coaster in the hogwarts area.

Best lead performances in the last century."
"I sat next to David Bowie and his wife while we were all waiting for a flight at the Montego Bay airport in Jamaica when I was like 19 . He bought me a Ting (jamaican drink)  from the drink cart and we all chatted for a bit. They were both just like ""regular"" people even tho they were both mega stars. We laughed about how hot it was in that damn airport and we parted ways when they boarded. As I walked through the plane, I had to walk past their first class seats.....he winked, smiled, and said ,""it was a joy meeting you (my name).""
Ziggy fucking Stardust said my name ! I will never forget that hour. Hit me hard when he passed away. RIP Ziggy. Have fun on Mars!"
"The pads you are thinking of are puppy pads and they are for house training a puppy. Puppys obviously do not know where they are supposed to go at first and often cannot hold it anyway, the pads are to train them where you want them to go and you gradually move them closer and closer to outside until that's the only place they go."
"Honestly turbo 2's are my favourite trainers out there. They often go on sale so it's worth keeping an eye out

I did get regular pegs recently as they were on offer at a bargain price (the 36 not the 37). Honestly they're great too. A little heavier and a little firmer. There's been no news from Nike about a new turbo coming and it does feel like the changes to the Pegasus means that they're for people who normally wear pegs and turbo's. Reviews have been pretty good on it"
"""If you--I'm Taylor Moore.""

I hope this is referenced in the next Rixty Minutes."
