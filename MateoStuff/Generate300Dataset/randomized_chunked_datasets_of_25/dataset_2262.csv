25559,"Imran Khan should be a cert in such a team. He's one of the top 10 bowlers of all time, a very useful lower order No.8, who averaged 38, and an inspirational leader. In the last 10 years of his career, Imran averaged 19 with the ball and 51 wit the bat. He's as close to a perfect all round cricketer as you can get. 

I love Wasim but have no idea why he gets picked over Imran, who was a better bowler and a far better batsman.",best cricket teams of all time
45215,"My wireless bluetooth headphones.

I'm blind in one eye and had surgery in the other eye last year, which didn't go quite as planned and left me almost blind (could only see dark/light and some motion) for a two month period. Bought the headphones the day before. They effortlessly connect to my phone and have buttons for volume, fast forward/rewind and play/pause.

I listened to 8 or more audiobooks during that time. Having something to occupy my mind and that I couls operate kept me sane. Best money I ever spent.

I see great now with my good eye, but still carry rhe headphones everywhere.",best items under $100

30480,"The world wars are interesting because most of the narrative is bullshit. For example, we're told Germany invaded Poland to start WW2, but this ignores how the Austrian-Hungarian empire was parcelled at the end of WW1, including the very part that Germany invaded (Danzig corridor). When Russia invaded Poland soon after, neither France nor England declared war on them also. All of Germany's ""invasions"" were reuniting the Austrian-Hungarian empire, or for preventing the continental landing by the British. This is why they took Norway, north France (not South), Belgium and Norway (not Sweden nor Finland). Same with Saddam Hussein's ""invasion"" of Kuwait. Kuwait and Iraq had been part of the Ottoman empire until WW1 parcelled it up. 100 years later and Bush's extension of England's wars to maintain world domination are still at work.

Churchill began blitzkrieg bombing civilian German areas *before* Germany ever did, and on the very next day after he took office. 10x as many German civilians were killed in blitzkrieg bombing than English civilians.

Jesse Owens was never snubbed by Hitler, and said in his autobiography that Hitler rose and waved at him.

Victors write history. I'm not defending the Nazis, but a hell of a lot of facts about history are buried to create a fictional good/evil dichotomy. However, after the war, Churchill did say ""we slaughtered the wrong pig"". It's never much acknowledged that National Socialism arose primarily as a reaction to Communism, it's extent of power intended to match it so Germany itself would not be overtaken by Communists, as it was directly after the war.",best Mexican war to study

69968,"B.S. in Physics here with a couple points. 

* There are no jobs for Physics B.S.  Be prepared to work in a different field or be in school for a long time.
* Great general B.S. that prepares you more than anything to think.  You will be able to perform well in any quantitative field.   Getting your foot in the door is another story.  Most hiring managers know that physics majors are legit, but no more legit than someone with a degree in the actual field they are hiring for so you'll be competing with those folks.  
* As its so general, you don't really get too into the ""cool"" stuff except maybe through an elective or two.  In other words, your core courses will mostly just be foundational stuff that has been known for 100+ years (newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, thermal dynamics, etc.)  Don't think you'll graduate as a ""scientist.""  You're just building a foundation and the real stuff comes via grad school.  Note that you'll probably have the opportunity to take graduate level electives and get a taste of that stuff.
* Classes are hard.  This has been stated plenty and it's probably the case with lots of degrees, but physics forced me to become a real student, not just a smart guy.  Through highschool I was fortunate enough to be able to do well in school without all that much effort.  By my Jr year in college, I was about to not be on track to graduate because I had too many D's in my core physics courses.  I had to reevaluate my approach to learning (actually learning, not just doing) and retake some courses, but that experience taught me more than anything else.
* By the end of my B.S. I knew I wanted a job, not more school, so I applied for anything quantitative that I coild.  I got two phone interviews and one call-back.  It was 2008 so I understand the economy was a factor but I definitely felt at a disadvantage due to my lack of specialized knowledge.  I was lucky enough to land a job in insurance (I found out later that they offered all 6 people they interviewed and only I and one other guy accepted).  Once I got my foot in the door, I did very well and I have since been able to build a good reputation, but I feel like I was lucky to get that foot in the door.  I work in finance now, but still feel disadvantaged vs. those with finance degrees.

Just thought I'd throw in a few comments about my experience. 7/10.  I don't regret anything but if I could do it over with the benefit of hindsight, I might choose a  less general degree.",best major to study in college
