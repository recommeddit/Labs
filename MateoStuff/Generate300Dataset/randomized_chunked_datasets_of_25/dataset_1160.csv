3776,"How ridiculously skeptical. Don't demean the work and effort of others if you don't have substantial evidence to support your claims. The IITs and IISc, Bangalore have been constantly ranking high in the QS Top Universities lists, and have a lot of great genuine research under their belt. So do many other Indian universities. And I'm pretty sure University ranking organizations can spot ""fake research"" better than most people do.",best college for research

10584,"The people who plan on stealing will find a way to steal *from bags they suspect have valuables in them,* when there is opportunity, or both.  When you put a padlock on, it creates extra motive to steal from you while offering like 4 s worth of additional deterrance compared to no lock at all.

This is the year I finally got into Lil Baby. I know I'm like 2-3 years behind but I just couldn't get into him back then. Then I heard Voice of the Heroes as a single it all just clicked for me. The VOTH album itself was pretty solid, been a fan of Durk for almost a decade, but the real treat was going on to listen to My Turn with this new perspective. I completely get the hype and in a way, being late is a blessing because I now have an insanely stacked back-catalog to go through. Also feels nice knowing that I'm choosing to remain open-minded, even if takes me a bit longer to get on board with the new shit than when I was younger.",best rap album
