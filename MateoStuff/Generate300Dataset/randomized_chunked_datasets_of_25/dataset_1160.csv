54140,best medicine for a cold,"Chicken soup with epic amounts of Sriracha sauce (that hot sauce with the green lid.) However, do not try this if your throat is sore."
13237,best gifts for mom,When our daughter was 2.5 months I bought my wife a tablet so she could easily check email and watch Netflix while nursing.  I got her the Nexus 7 which is small enough to hold in one hand.  She loves it.
3776,best college for research,"How ridiculously skeptical. Don't demean the work and effort of others if you don't have substantial evidence to support your claims. The IITs and IISc, Bangalore have been constantly ranking high in the QS Top Universities lists, and have a lot of great genuine research under their belt. So do many other Indian universities. And I'm pretty sure University ranking organizations can spot ""fake research"" better than most people do."
67134,best places to skydive in california,Because it is a completely compulsory potentially life ending recreational activity and at 16 humans are unable to give adequate informed consent to do such a thing.

51669,best iphone case,"Ordered the official Apple clear case, tech 21 pure clear case, and official apple pine green silicone case. Have no idea which one to use lol"
70398,best major to study in college,"I studied Political Science and loved it! Looking back I always had a slight interest in the sciences too, and wish I took a minor in Neuroscience to go with my poli sci studies (or even an Arts & Science degree, which is 2 minors with classes that help you tie your studies together).

Ironically enough, now that I've graduated I have a passion project writing on behavioural science & psychology in politics. So I still filled that gap!"
10584,best suitcase lock,"The people who plan on stealing will find a way to steal *from bags they suspect have valuables in them,* when there is opportunity, or both.  When you put a padlock on, it creates extra motive to steal from you while offering like 4 s worth of additional deterrance compared to no lock at all.  There are videos of people using ink pens to open locked zippers all over the place and they do it in about as much time as it takes to open an unlocked zipper."
38267,best newspapers to read,"> Any biases they have are often implicated or mentioned by the writers.

... From what I have seen and have read, The Economist does a good job maintaining its neutrality. The Economist doesn't favor or disfavor regulation, it allows it writers to communicate their ideas on the topic. In so far as I have read, The Economist doesn't support either as an organization. Articles have been written by their staff that both favor and disfavor deregulation."
33141,best energy drink,"On occasion.  And that occasion is if I'm uncomfortably and unusually tired that day, even after getting good meal, enough water, my daily tea ration, and a full night's sleep.

Energy drinks, for me, are a way of keeping me alert long enough to do just one more thing in the day.  I usually only drink ones with no artificial sweeteners (sadly only Monster is available here), and I prefer coffee to these B-vitamin infused snake oil cans."
50681,best rap album,"Fun Ones, #3

This is the year I finally got into Lil Baby. I know I'm like 2-3 years behind but I just couldn't get into him back then. Then I heard Voice of the Heroes as a single it all just clicked for me. The VOTH album itself was pretty solid, been a fan of Durk for almost a decade, but the real treat was going on to listen to My Turn with this new perspective. I completely get the hype and in a way, being late is a blessing because I now have an insanely stacked back-catalog to go through. Also feels nice knowing that I'm choosing to remain open-minded, even if takes me a bit longer to get on board with the new shit than when I was younger."
51901,best iphone case,I’d definitely switch if you can. I have the same case for the 12 Pro and it does not age well. Pick a darker color or a different case entirely. They are cheaper leather than in years past and won’t patina. https://i.imgur.com/qGee1fe.jpg
