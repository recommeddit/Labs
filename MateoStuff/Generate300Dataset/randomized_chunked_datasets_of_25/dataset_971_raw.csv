I actually listen to NPR or TYT podcast.  My work out is also an opportunity to become more informed about the world.
"My first celebrity experience when I first moved to LA was meeting Weird Al Yankovich.  He came in to eat at the restaurant I was hosting at and while his date was in the bathroom before they left he was was sitting in this lounging area we had.  Being all of 18 and thinking I was playing it cool I asked ""So, you working on anything new?"" like I knew him personally or something.

He just kind of shrugged and said not really and was followed by another 40 seconds or so of awkward silence.  He wasn't rude or nice; it was obvious he wasn't in the mood though.  Which I totally get now nearly two decades later."
"A meat thermometer, take all the guess work out of your internal temperatures. No more assuming and possibly eating undercooked meat or eating dried out chicken."
"10+ years ago, Bryan Singer was working on one with Matt Damon in the lead. It got put on hold and now, at best, will be a few years, assuming BS can get de-cancelled.

I'm hoping he doesn't."
Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. A gem.

I know... It really sucks that this is the case in TX. Hoping they will allow in-state dealerships now that Tesla is building a factory near Austin.

I just went to a community college for wind energy nothing crazy. But it got me interested in engineering.
"Doubled in Computer Science and Marketing. Wish I would have done Philosophy or English instead of Marketing. Marketing is pretty useless for me, and the others woulda been more fun. I'm working in Computer Science regardless."
"Different countries have different conditions which suit different types of players. Pitches in the subcontinent are better for batting and spinners, not so good for fast bowlers. Unsurprisingly, India and Sri Lanka are known for their batsmen and spinners. Then we have an anomaly - Pakistan. They have the same kinds of pitches, suitable for batsmen and spinners. But they constantly produce incredible fast bowlers, one after another. 

Australia and South Africa always have great all round teams. Great fast bowlers and great batsmen. 

New Zealand is known for great fielding, mostly because we've often been a bit crap at batting and bowling. 

The West Indies destroyed teams in the 70s and 80s with an incredible selection of deadly fast bowlers, including a guy with the best nickname ever - Whispering Death. These days they're unfortunately nowhere near the same level but still have the ability to surprise."
"Did the same thing as you, graduated last May. I currently write for a travel company and I'm moving to the Philippines in April. I'm not making as much as my friends, but they're stuck in the office and I've been to three continents in the past 9 months."

"I met Sebastian Stan on the streets of Paris while they were filming for the spy movie (305?). All around was super nice. He was just standing off set, and I kinda just walked up and said hi and he was super nice, and kept asking questions as to what I was doing in Paris etc and seemed genuinely involved in our conversation."
"Southern Utah has some of the most amazing scenery you will ever see. However, it sounds like that's a bit away from where you're looking for."
"I would recommend being an expert in JavaScript. By that I mean understand everything about it. When you do, learning other libraries (Node, React, etc) would be easy to understand. From there on it’ll be easy to learn another language."

"I picked one of these up for £35 on offer from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/RAVPower-Portable-20000mAh-High-Capacity-Compatible-Black/dp/B083J2YKRL/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=ravpower+usb+c&qid=1592394405&sr=8-9) and it works well;.

I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard at anything. I’m still in tears writing this.
