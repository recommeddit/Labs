17236,best iOS game,"Damn that's a shame, I just tried it the other day thinking it would be a free-to-try premium thing like Bastion or Inside. I was very wrong lmao there's IAP's for \*limited time\* boosts and currencies so I got out fast."
62019,Best RPG game on PS4,"Probably someone who has never played it. If you want an immersive experience then go for it. The whole saga is heart wrenching, exciting and intriguing."

53238,best usb c charging cable,"I have some UGREEN products - very good quality.   I have their lightning to audio jack dongle - way better quality than the Apple product, and is MFi certified too.  Saying that - Anker has not let me down either."

40320,best midrange CPU,"DDR5 in a 12600K is overkill. Use DDR4, you wont even notice any difference, especially in gaming. I have a 12900k with DDR5 so I speak from experience... That and its near impossible to find DDR5 (and the price)"

28664,best breakfast foods,Oh man. I lived in Raleigh in the late 90's. Moved to Montana. No grits. No country ham. No sweet tea. No BOJANGLES! wah
25535,best cricket teams of all time,"Pretty good XI. Can't really argue any of them aren't absolute greats. 

1) Hobbs - Agreed

2) Gavaskar - Maybe Hayden, but I can see why Gavaskar just pipped him

3) Bradman - If you disagree with this, you don't know cricket

4) Tendulkar - Agreed

5) Sanga - His average is just below 60 with over 12 000 runs. Can't dispute that

6) Sobers - Only rival would be Kallis

7) Gilchrist - Only rival would be if Sanga was WK. Boucher and a few others could challenge as keeper alone, but no one else for WK/batting combo

8) Akram - Here I would argue Imran Khan. Could also put Botham, Hadlee, Miller, Kapil Dev

9) Warne - Fair. Obvious rival is Murali

10) Marshall - Always going to be difficult because there's so many great seamers. He's one of the best.

11) Lillee - Same as above. Might argue McGrath, but I won't disagree with Dennis.


All in all good list, OP. Only major change is maybe put Sanga on gloves and then you could replace Gilly with another batsman, but the thing is you're going to be hard pressed to find a lower-middle batsman better than Gilly anyway. Maybe Allan Border, who I argue is underrated and just that tiny bit better than S. Waugh, Ponting, Clarke. 

Wally Hammond probably deserves a spot, too, but I couldn't find somewhere he could fit."
44288,best items under $100,Just wipe some shaving cream on the mirror and rinse off. Instant fogless for that shower time.
22362,best celebrity,"I went to Grad school at Pepperdine in Malibu, down the road from where he lives. Adam used to come a play pick up ball on campus pretty often. Nice guy for sure."
40270,best midrange CPU,"Well... 3300x is quite expensive. In my country:

**Ryzen 3300x**: 145 USD

**Ryzen 3600**: 204 USD

Clearly, Ryzen 3600 is a better choice - 2 more cores and 4 additional threads for only ~50 USD."
10243,best pencil for drawing,I've got one in 0.5 (model 1000) and it's a winner for sure.
797,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,Good old vanilla. You can always customize it as per your choosing but vanilla is a really good base.
24266,best anime,"I'm glad to hear you like it.  I hope you find some interesting anime to watch.

If you like Cowboy Bebop, you'll probably like Samurai Champloo, and maybe also Baccano."
7767,best laptop for general use,"I couldn't either, nor could I find any articles about it. Okay thanks a lot for the info. Will definitely look for for dual channel for the Intel graphics. 

Also since you're here what would you say is the best 14"" Windows laptop ATM. Ideally I'd get the new macbook air but I'd rather stay on the windows."
1907,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Have you tried Olio Pizzeria?
