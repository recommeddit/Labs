"I've owned a number of Peppers brand sunglasses that I really like. You can find them online for $30-50 depending on the style. I've found that the lens quality is on par with much more expensive sunglasses, and the build quality is good for the price point as well.

"I want the 11 Pro something fierce and could—with slight difficulty—probably manage to make the base model work cost wise with trading in my current phone. But I’d be in for $1200 because Apple insists on making 64GB the new standard and 128 is the sweet spot for me.

"Well, progressive parts of the US will works for that (barring healthcare).
Many parts of western Europe correspond to what you are looking for, and add to that Australia and New Zealand. I'd personally chose the UK if I were you."
Is there anywhere to stream A Touch of Frost? I want to rewatch - I watched it initially back when Bravo still aired decent shows but can't find it anywhere.
I went to SFA once and it was the worst experience I've ever had in an amusement part. Never again. I felt so unsafe on the rides and we only got on 4 rides in 5 hours when the park was basically empty
I should bill the publisher.
