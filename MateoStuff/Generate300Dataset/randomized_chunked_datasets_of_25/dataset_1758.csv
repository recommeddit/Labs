3909,best online college,"Ah.  Yeah, I can see that.  Those poor kids I see moseying about at CNU look so poor and downtrodden.  Legitimate Sacrifice?  Most of those kids have no clue what a legitimate sacrifice is.  What, exactly are you ""sacrificing""?  

I'd have loved to go to college right out of high school.  Spent that dreamy time taking care of my mother until she died of cancer.  Pity I couldn't have made that college sacrifice.  After that, I enlisted into the Army.  Now THAT was a cake walk.  All those leadership skills just handed to me on a platter, rather than having to earn them like those poor hardworking college kids.  All those technical skills just dropped into my lap while those poor college kids had to slave over their classes.  

22 years of that, much of it running organizations larger than most companies, and as I grow older, marriage, kids, always moving, wars, etc...but that holds no ""prestige"" within your circles.  

But you betray your ignorance with the statement ""College was never meant to be something to do in conjunction with work""  No, it wasn't.  Once upon a time, the social elite sent their kids to colleges and universities because they could, while common folk went in for a trade, if they were lucky, or just did whatever they could to survive.  The commoner going to college was seen as an anomaly, and he was despised for it, generally.  

You asked me to imagine being flat broke for four years and only able to work 15 hours a week...  Now you imagine having two kids at home and one in college, a mortgage on a 3500 square foot house in a decent neighborhood because you don't want your kids to have to do what you did to get started in life.  Imagine stroking check after check for your wife's tuition, because at the time you have a job making more money than most college grads could dream of making- but not taking your turn just yet.  Then the bottom falls out of the economy, and that job goes away.  Imagine working 12 hours, getting home, and firing up a computer for another three or four hours.  Do that for a couple of years.  Imagine selling off things you worked hard for so you can buy a car for your son to take to college...that you just sold a motorcycle to pay tuition to so he wouldn't have to take out a loan...and selling another motorcycle for the next semester...losing shit you earned the money to pay for...and still working at a shit job many levels below where you should be because there's people out there with Bachelors degrees like yours that just don't get it...college is a breeze compared to real life.  Sacrifice?  Until you've driven yourself to utter exhaustion to provide others a better life than you did, you have no clue what sacrifice is.  You really don't.  

I was a project manager running a portfolio of projects long before I hung up the uniform.  I was an operations manager, and more than that, I was a leader, in charge of real people, real deadlines, real budgets-something no college kid ever has the opportunity, much less the ability to do...but people like you cling to that paradigm without the slightest clue as to what life really is.  Yet in corporate America, you become the gatekeepers.  HR Punks with ""regular"" degrees, without a clue as to how to evaluate the quality of a potential job applicant.  You discard anyone who has had to take a route different from yours, hit the delete key when sifting through resumes, and then sending corporate recruiters to job fairs to find someone that looks and talks like you. 

Yeah, I went to college online.  Difference between me and you, I had *context* to apply to my studies.  The best you could hope for is to be able to remember a fraction of whatever you learned in school when the situation arises where you can apply it.  

You scan a resume for ten seconds, then toss it, or like you, thinking less of a person because they got their degree online- regardless of the school.  You honestly think you did the right thing by your company?  You honestly think you fairly and accurately evaluated that person to determine if they were the best fir for the job?  No.  You didn't.  Same applies for thinking you are somehow superior to someone because of how they got their degree.  All you did was look down on someone because they don't look like you."
