38716,"The Times, the Guardian (though it has a left wing bias that some people take issue with) and the Independent are the more literate papers. Possibly also the Telegraph - though that has a right wing bias that some people take issue with.

The thing to bear in mind is that in the UK newpapers are not politically neutral, they have a clear and stated bias.  For neutrality in news reporting people would go to the BBC.

The Daily Mail is known for being hateful and  mendacious.",best newspapers to read

56633,"Cc: /u/MikeNotBrick: awesome guide! I would love to see a (sub-)section of the Multi Monitor part that discusses the compatibility/impact of mix and matching refresh rates for multi screen setups. 

I’m currently looking at going from 27”/1440p@60hz dual monitors to 144hz. It’s really hard to find any good info on whether I can upgrade just my main monitor to the asus 27”/144/1440p and use my existing asus 27”/60/1440p for my second screen or if I should upgrade both. 

I keep hearing people mention that alt-tabbing is an issue with different refresh rates and that playing a twitch stream on the 2nd screen while gaming at a higher refresh rate on the 144hz GSYNC screen would cause video to stutter etc. 

Budget isn’t the issue but obviously I don’t want to buy 2 new screens if just upgrading the main one will suffice. 

Also, do gaming modes factor in at all? I usually play “windowed borderless” instead of “full screen” for example as I interact with the second screen a lot. 

Cheers!",best desktop monitor
