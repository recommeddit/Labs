38716,best newspapers to read,"The Times, the Guardian (though it has a left wing bias that some people take issue with) and the Independent are the more literate papers. Possibly also the Telegraph - though that has a right wing bias that some people take issue with.

The thing to bear in mind is that in the UK newpapers are not politically neutral, they have a clear and stated bias.  For neutrality in news reporting people would go to the BBC.

The Daily Mail is known for being hateful and  mendacious."
21591,best winnie the pooh comic,"Yeah, being a single mother totally fits in with all those other things."
67891,best science fiction novel,It's certainly not for everyone.   I love it and plan on reading it again.   Joyce's Ulysses is my nemesis.   I've started it at least 5 times and i just can't even.   Only reason it is still on my shelf is that it is the last Christmas gift I got from my mom and it has a nice note from her inside the cover.

49550,best gaming monitor,"Depends what you use it for. Modern games can't push 144 fps at 4k.

If you play some strategy, moba, or things like that, then sure.

Or if you don't game and need it for something esle, sure.

I got a second monitor, 4k 60hz becasue I cheaped out.

It's a productivity monitor for work, I'll be coding on it."

56633,best desktop monitor,"Cc: /u/MikeNotBrick: awesome guide! I would love to see a (sub-)section of the Multi Monitor part that discusses the compatibility/impact of mix and matching refresh rates for multi screen setups. 

I’m currently looking at going from 27”/1440p@60hz dual monitors to 144hz. It’s really hard to find any good info on whether I can upgrade just my main monitor to the asus 27”/144/1440p and use my existing asus 27”/60/1440p for my second screen or if I should upgrade both. 

I keep hearing people mention that alt-tabbing is an issue with different refresh rates and that playing a twitch stream on the 2nd screen while gaming at a higher refresh rate on the 144hz GSYNC screen would cause video to stutter etc. 

Budget isn’t the issue but obviously I don’t want to buy 2 new screens if just upgrading the main one will suffice. 

Also, do gaming modes factor in at all? I usually play “windowed borderless” instead of “full screen” for example as I interact with the second screen a lot. 

Cheers!"
