It was even better in that Gilchrist was coming in and making tonnes when we were already 5-500. Johnson and the others have been fighting rearguards for the current team.",best cricket teams of all time

26703,"**Keyflower** - A bidding worker placement game that works at all player counts. Balance using your workers as currency to expand your town, using actions on any visible tile, and possibly giving your opponent more workers next round.

**Eclipse** - Heavy euro 4x space game. Might not be best for someone just getting into the hobby, but it is a game you should have.

**Roll for the Galaxy** - Dice game where you roll some dice and build a space empire. Plays fast, and is fairly easy to learn.

**Seasons** - Card drafting and dice rolling combined into a really great game. Collect energy to play the cards you drafted to build an engine to get the most points.

**Viticulture** - Card driven worker placement game about making wine. It has a really cool, simple mechanic for getting grapes and turning them into wine.

**Suburbia** *or* **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - I'd say either game is great depending on your theme preference. I actually prefer the city building theme in Suburbia, but Castles did make some things play a little better. Score points for building the best city/castle.

**Taluva** - This might be my favorite abstract game. Build a 3D island out of volcanoes and be the first one to build up your island city. 

**Star Realms** - Fantastic deckbuilding game that plays in no time. Also a good intro to deckbuilding if you haven't played any.

**Lanterns** - Great, simple tile laying game. I never was a huge fan of Carcassone, visually or mechanically, so this was an easy replacement.

**Agricola** - The game is a mile deep with all of the different possible card options. It needs to be there simply because of replayability.",best board games

2.  SFoG - Fav coaster(Goliath), a good overall collection but nothing else spectacular, lots of trees, 

3.  SFGAd - good collection of coasters, my favorite layout and location of the SF chain

4.  SFMM - Been 16 years since I've been here so can't remember too much and I'm sure the park has changed a lot in many ways.

5.  SFDK - Besides Joker (which is amazing), not much else exciting.    

RIP - SFWoA  -  A fun park and such a shame its gone.",best roller coaster at six flags
