15099,"The Sons of Destiny series by Jean Johnson. Not super popular, but the series over all is interesting if you can suspend your disbelief a little.

I’m also in love with Sherrilyn Kenyon. I love the Born Of series from her.

I also liked this older space series by Susan Kearney (can’t remember the name right now).

62513,"I would say Odyssey is a pretty good game, but I wouldn't classify it as a full on RPG. It's more of an action game, with some light RPG elements (dialogue choices that don't change much, some gear/weapons to swap, skill tree, etc.)

People have all kinds of different definitions of what an RPG is; I think the previous guy was saying he didn't consider it an RPG. Good game, just not a traditional RPG like some others.",Best RPG game on PS4
