15099,best romantic novel,"The Sons of Destiny series by Jean Johnson. Not super popular, but the series over all is interesting if you can suspend your disbelief a little.

I’m also in love with Sherrilyn Kenyon. I love the Born Of series from her.

I also liked this older space series by Susan Kearney (can’t remember the name right now).

I liked Lynn Vihel’s (sp?) vampire novels.

Oh and an erotica novel called Venus Rising. I will reread it once every few years."

16966,best iOS game,An old iOS favorite of mine is 868-HACK. Really weird game that is basically a single screen rogue like that doesn't provide instructions. Part of the game is figuring out how to play the game. It's a great iPhone game.

70174,best major to study in college,"Nope, just syntax."
60249,best freezer brand,"If you consider how quickly non-frozen food can go bad, it's well worth the cost. It's also good for left-overs. Just make sure you get a size that makes sense. They sell smaller ones for under $200, which I think is good for small families."
62513,Best RPG game on PS4,"I would say Odyssey is a pretty good game, but I wouldn't classify it as a full on RPG. It's more of an action game, with some light RPG elements (dialogue choices that don't change much, some gear/weapons to swap, skill tree, etc.)

People have all kinds of different definitions of what an RPG is; I think the previous guy was saying he didn't consider it an RPG. Good game, just not a traditional RPG like some others."

I watch this ever now & then. Never fails to make me cry with laughter :'D
