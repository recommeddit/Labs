I love Beta heroes because it is so nice to change it up. I'm totally going to check this one out. Thank you!
I ordered the one with the matte black edges.   That way the green really pops as green.   At least that’s my plan.
"I only read Echopraxia and thought it was utter garbage and liked Dune very much... Scifi is all about taste. First which genre, next which setting.... but in those categories there are some essentials imho (those who helped define or bring the subgenre forward) and you will somewhen stumble on to them and most likely read them. Who cares if someone else thinks bad about it, that doesn't matter, but some will be classics/essentials.

They are also not classic/essentials because of lack of competition, but because of going new ways (or old ways in a new fashion). It would mean, that there are only about 200 great scifi books, since they are the only ones in those lists. No... the others were not good enough or have been long forgotten. Scifi always had the cliche of being a trash genre and at the core this is not so wrong... there is a lot of shit printed and titled Scifi out there and has been in the past.

"Cranberry juice, sprite, and dragonberry bacardi. It tastes like a pink starburst.

"In world cups 
France have 1 title, 1 final 3 semi-final 2 quarter final.
Spain have 1 title 1 semi final 4 quarter finals. 
We also have a 3-1-1 record against you in tournaments if we include euros. If we had the same kind of record against Italy or Germany we would have won shit tons of trophies."
"I have a king size bed, and even king size comforters are kind of small, so my partner and I have two king size comforters — one one each side, so no one has to share."
The Sixth Sense surprised the heck out of me.

"ahh man, it would have been perfect if it used the google earth background but still gave me the 8 common tabs...."
"Classical! None of the up tempo stuff for me, it doesn’t help. It just irritates me. Bach is the ticket."
"Can you post a link for the Bidet attachment. I have always been interested in one, but never knew you can purchase one for <$100. I know top tear ones can be over $1000. Ill buy one today if it only costs $70"
"Yes I love how the savory taste of vegetable oil combines with flavors named after colors.

No seriously, [look at the ingredients](http://www.beveragesdirect.com/detail-682-AMP_Energy_Drink_24_Pack.asp).  They put oil in there so you'll drink it faster.  YUMMMMM.

But don't worry!  It's only a 'small quantity', [""as its concentration is regulated by the US, and banned in 100 other countries.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew).  So, you can [FEEL SAFE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_vegetable_oil#Health_effect) while drinking it!!!!"
I'm in the same situation looking for the same exact answer. Let me know where you choose and how it was
Good luck. I don’t think you will find one. But I hope someone replies.
That should have worked...
Still varies by area. In my area Verizon is atrocious and T-Mobile is great.
"First off, I love these posts. I get some inspiration from them, so thank you for posing your question.

Now for my answer. I got a 5 pack of phone chargers that were 6 and 10 foot long. I liked having so many because then I wouldn't have to compromise and had multiple charging locations throughout my home/ at work. It was like 30 bucks on Amazon, and it has made my life so much better!"
">lets go through just, idk, the top 50"
Why did you find the 6s plus the worst if I may ask?
