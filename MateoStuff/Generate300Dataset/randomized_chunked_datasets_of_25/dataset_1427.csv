6681,best iPhone,"What do you do with your phone? Why are you sold on getting a smartphone? Dumb phones do still exist, and arguably look better than ever."
55505,best action and adventure novel series,"Haha that's ok, I appreciate the recommendation and I'll have a look at it. I mean if it's a good book then I'm still interested. Let me know if you think of another one though!"
33134,best energy drink,"Yes, but typically only the Java Monster drinks.  Fave flavors are Mean Bean and Loca Moca.  Russian and Lo-Ball aren't bad either.  The fiance prefers the Amp/NOS/Full Throttle style drinks but I can't stand the way they taste."
20625,best workout music,[The New Workout Plan by Kanye West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTLhfRGCZq0) has to be my favorite at the current moment
4701,best home improvement store,"I had the opposite experience. Lowe's delivered a gas grill, barely wanted to take it off the truck. Home Depot delivered a full set of new kitchen appliances and were willing to not only take them out, but also do the full water/drain/gas hookups even though I hadn't paid for them. One difference may be that Lowe's delivered in a Lowe's truck, but HD subcontracted out the delivery."
49096,best gaming monitor,Stay away from the msi optix
10555,best suitcase lock,Strictly speaking the box with the firearm can not include anything else but the firearm and accessories. So you can not pack a box with a lower receiver and your laptop. You would have to ship the laptop separately. However in practice you can get away with this unless you are quite ridiculous.
19688,best YouTube video,Important videos playlist
35414,best alcoholic drink,"Besides specific drink mixes. One of the best tricks for this is to use large cups or containers. You can put 4+ shots in a big cup then top it with whatever juice or soda mixer and barely taste the alcohol but people will chug away as if it was just soda or juice. No matter the mix, 4 shots is four shots just might have to take a few extra bathroom breaks."
13458,best spreadsheet editor,"Try kingsoft office, it is awesome!

5989,best programming language for web development,"It's a Javascript runtime which basically gives you the ability to execute Javascript server-side instead of using something like PHP or a more modern backend written in something like Ruby/Java/Go etc. The draw is that you could essentially write an entire full-stack web application in Javascript, which wasn't possible really before Node came along"
34199,best NFL player,Now that Luck is retired we need an unnecessarily hostile rivalry over Bobby vs Leonard.
999,best ice cream flavor,"Woah. TIL. I'm gonna feel soo fuckin' fancy the next time I eat ice cream.. 

""Caviar? Psshhh, nah. That's for plebs. Check out my *vanilla extract*."""
66628,best soccer team in the world,If you're a glory hunter pick Man City or Chelsea.

4946,best home improvement store,"Menards requires masks. Until COVID has a vaccine, it's the place for me."
58368,best cologne,"red is ""citrus"", black is more ""woody"" if that makes any sense."
928,best desk lamp,I just got my wife a Himalayan Salt Lamp if thats your thing :o
38419,best newspapers to read,"Yea 17 here and i do the same. I used to just scroll through the sports section but now i read business, art, and world news."
27072,best board games,I'm really surprised with some of these. Cool idea. Thanks for putting this together.
47776,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"GeoGebra. I'd choose GeoGebra 5 (it has an older UI but better functionality). It's a computer program which is really handy. It has a CAS solver (solves higher degree equations, equation systems and also integrates and derivates), it plots functions and equations and has a quite nice graphing portion. The graphing lets you put things like points on a plane, then put the lines that go through that point, then you can get the lines between the points, then you can make a circle that has a tangent that goes through that very same point, and it's all really nice. It also lets you make ""sliders"" that let contstants in equations vary. I know that sound a bit weird, but lets say you have a line y=3x+a, and a circle (y-3)^2 +(x-7)^2 =0 and you want to find out for what values on a the line lies tangent to the circle. Then you can just make a slider for a, and then test answers. Your math professor probably won't accept them as answers, but it's an excellent way of testing your answer. Oh and you can graph multivariable functions eg. f(x,y) in 3D-space and draw shapes in 3D-space, which I found very helpful as I really need visual help when I'm solving harder questions. 

I know this was a bit of a ramble, but i really like GeoGebra and it has helped me a lot."
15339,best tree for the garden,"Same, though I've never had to park under the one in my street so that could change my mind if it came to pass"
37878,best Marvel movie,"The ending kind of threw off the rest of it for me. I still very much enjoyed the movie but it turned in Godzilla vs Kong the last 15 minutes or so. I get it, they needed to raise the stakes and power scale Shang Chi in a major way as his next appearance will likely be alongside some formidable allies and foes. I bought into the mythical land and creature and thought it was well done, but the “soul sucker” vs Dragon thing is something I think they jumped to too fast."
9592,best toothpaste,What about Emoform toothpaste? Does anyone know it and recommend it?
34260,best NFL player,They say in the article that this is not weighted by position value. Just an overall estimate based on the grades they got from PFF in the past.
