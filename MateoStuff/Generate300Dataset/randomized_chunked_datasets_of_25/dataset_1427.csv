4701,"I had the opposite experience. Lowe's delivered a gas grill, barely wanted to take it off the truck. Home Depot delivered a full set of new kitchen appliances and were willing to not only take them out, but also do the full water/drain/gas hookups even though I hadn't paid for them. One difference may be that Lowe's delivered in a Lowe's truck, but HD subcontracted out the delivery.",best home improvement store

10555,Strictly speaking the box with the firearm can not include anything else but the firearm and accessories. So you can not pack a box with a lower receiver and your laptop. You would have to ship the laptop separately. However in practice you can get away with this unless you are quite ridiculous.,best suitcase lock

You can put 4+ shots in a big cup then top it with whatever juice or soda mixer and barely taste the alcohol but people will chug away as if it was just soda or juice. No matter the mix, 4 shots is four shots just might have to take a few extra bathroom breaks.",best alcoholic drink

47776,"GeoGebra. I'd choose GeoGebra 5 (it has an older UI but better functionality). It's a computer program which is really handy. It has a CAS solver (solves higher degree equations, equation systems and also integrates and derivates), it plots functions and equations and has a quite nice graphing portion. The graphing lets you put things like points on a plane, then put the lines that go through that point, then you can get the lines between the points, then you can make a circle that has a tangent that goes through that very same point, and it's all really nice. It also lets you make ""sliders"" that let contstants in equations vary. I know that sound a bit weird, but lets say you have a line y=3x+a, and a circle (y-3)^2 +(x-7)^2 =0 and you want to find out for what values on a the line lies tangent to the circle. Then you can just make a slider for a, and then test answers. Your math professor probably won't accept them as answers, but it's an excellent way of testing your answer. Oh and you can graph multivariable functions eg. f(x,y) in 3D-space and draw shapes in 3D-space, which I found very helpful as I really need visual help when I'm solving harder questions. 

I know this was a bit of a ramble, but i really like GeoGebra and it has helped me a lot.",best graphing calculator for vector calculus

I get it, they needed to raise the stakes and power scale Shang Chi in a major way as his next appearance will likely be alongside some formidable allies and foes. I bought into the mythical land and creature and thought it was well done, but the “soul sucker” vs Dragon thing is something I think they jumped to too fast.",best Marvel movie
