Got a free and secure alternative?
WHAT!?
"I was born in NZ, what about the high tax, low wage and high cost of living?

I do miss NZ so much though, I cried every now and then for years after we moved. I was a kid but compared to aus, NZ school system is awesome. We lived in Cartaton (?) and the small country school had amazing funding."
"I can't fucking stand this song. It's not catchy whatsoever and the lyrics are annoying. I really don't know why everyone in the fucking world loves it. Call me a curmudgeon, but fuck that song.

Don't get me wrong, I love the FUCK out of Disney songs, just not that one."
Ive also head many nightmare stories on connectivity
YES to the Hugh Howey books. Completely agree. There were some good lines in Beacon 23.
Who is Cartman's Dad?

The naans you can get in a bag at the grocery store would probably be pretty good for mini pizzas too
microemacs (me) also has a file explorer (using F10) that is very nice.
"To someone who isn't familiar with azuki beans, it probably does. Haha, who wants ice cram made from beans?  But red bean paste is actually amazingly delicious.  I miss living near a Japanese bakery."
"Lodi-Cheap. Monterey-Best views. Skydive Norcal-2nd best views, and you can make a day out of it wine tasting if you want. Skydive California (Tracy)-friendliest, imo. Hard to go wrong with any in the Bay really"

"Raw chia seed pudding, preferably chocolate. Sprinkle of bee pollen on top, and a glass of grapefruit juice"
"Really?  You don’t like Iron Man 2?  It’s my favorite Phase 1 besides Avengers.  It’s the one movie that feels like it really exists in a bigger universe, /plus/ it’s full of a lot of subtle character building and has a lot of likable characters."
I've never had a mechanical keyboard. Idk what they feel like.
"we see you Ok Cupid PR rep /glare

"Doh, I guess I'll have to stop using it :-("
I want to find a woman that looks at me the way this guy looks at flashlights.
"I'm a math major.

The best part about my major is learning how certain results can lead to many other properties of mathematics. It's also quite fascinating how many different fields there are. Also in my specific program most of the professors and students are great to be around.

The worst part is trying to prove these results you learned in all of your classes are true. Sometimes it's straightforward. Sometimes its abstract and rigorous, and you can sometimes spend a really long time figuring out what to do. Upper division math is like this at the core, and many people really struggle with proofs and end up failing classes like real analysis and abstract algebra. But when you figure out a hard proof it's a great feeling."
