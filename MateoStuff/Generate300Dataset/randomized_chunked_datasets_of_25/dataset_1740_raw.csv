"I've read a few places that carbonated water is good for helpgin your body turn acetaldehyde into acetate, meaning you don't get hangover symptoms the next day. 

I'll be damned if I can't go ridiculously ham while drinking club soda in between, then wake up the next morning with no symptoms. I'd say it could be just luck but I've done it so many times that it's not longer just anecdote to me.

Here's just one article, it has links to the study and stuff, I just wanna show I'm not talking out of my ass http://greatist.com/health/best-hangover-cure-soda-101013"
"Really awesome write-up guide!

For those with a tight budget, I just bought a 27"" Dell IPS 1080p@75Hz :

$150 at Best Buy right now, best deal I could find by a long shot.

The picture is fantastic, pixel density be damned... Very happy with it. Sure it would have been nice to get a faster refresh rate or Gsync (got a 1070), but this sure is a nice placeholder!"
Claire is the best!

Agreed. The bottle is the best part!
"I still have and use a C270- it's fine for a face cam and if you have(had) poorer internet like me it's likely you can only pump out good 720p.  I started streaming with a dual core laptop with AMD graphics just to see if I liked it  (Not games though... when I attempted that for a week or two the computer overheated) and upgraded PCs when things got really moving.

Some of the fastest growing game based content creators I've seen don't even have a webcam.  As long as your voice sounds decent, and your content has enough pixels, it's all about your personality really. 

I would definitely say that you should start doing more than you should be theorising.  A lot of my initial thoughts about streaming changed (and continue to change) as I'm doing it longer and longer."
I would argue but......

"Man by Calvin Klein. Honestly. I bought it for my boyfriend last Christmas, he approves and so do I :) www.cheapsmells.co.uk"
Textpad is pure awesome.
Dragons Dogma is an underground hit. It’s got its jank but it’s one of my all time favorites. The souls series is a good option if you’re looking for something a little challenging

"If you’re using Chimera, like I am, you’ll need to use Chimera 1.0.4 as it’s the last version to unofficially support adding Cydia. Add the following repo to your package manager of your choice: https://diatr.us/chicydia

Then just install the package named “Cydia for Chimera/Electra” and you’re good to go!"
"Awesome! Is it difficult? I bought Andy Ricker's book 'Pok Pok' specifically for this recipe, but have been too intimidated to try it."
Are they less than 60 grand base price? If not I don’t care
"In my experience I still don't find 8 cores to be that useful in gaming. My 3600x is more than enough for what I play, I think that games that actually require 8 cores won't be a common occurrence for quite some time."
