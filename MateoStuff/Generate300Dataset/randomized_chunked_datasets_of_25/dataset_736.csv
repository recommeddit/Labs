64578,"Can’t recommend the epic react flyknits enough. Super light and very comfortable. Just ran my first half-marathon in them today! 

The one thing I would say is they run a little big, so maybe go a half-size smaller than your usual, or just double up on socks. But I would try them on first. Good luck!",Best Nike running shoes

33445,"Yes, Tesla is currently delivering more electric cars since mostly all major manufacturers have not shifted towards electric cars.    

GM and basically all others are heading that way. They may be playing catch up as they don't have much of a line up at the moment but it will not take long for them to get there. They too have massive pockets, a massive fanbase and a supply network beyond Teslas current capabilities.    

GM sells close to 3 millions cars a year, Tesla is having supply problems with ~400k a year. If GM or others shift their factories to electric cars they'll be able to deliver and not just promise.   

They are top dogs but they are also old dogs so we will have to wait a few years and see if they can pull it off. I'm pretty sure they will though. Not sure where that'll leave Tesla. I have a feeling they will shift towards a more luxurious brand and leave the $30-40k market for GM and others. I doubt they'll be able to compete on the lower end.",best electric car

16531,"My 2 year old LOVES his betta fish, Marvin. He turns his light on in the morning and off at night, and helps with feeding. He will go up and pat the side of the tank gently and say ""good night Marvin"".

But he also loses interest and forgets to feed him, so technically I look after the fish and he sometimes helps, which is exactly why we got something so low-maintenance. We also travel quite a bit, and it's much easier to ask a neighbour to pop in and drop a new pellet of food in after 7 days than to find someone to take care of a dog.",best pet for toddlers
68734,"- The Space Between Worlds by Micaiah Johnson (Just finished. LOVED it!!!)

- The Broken Earth trilogy by N. K. Jemisin

(I'd always recommend The Giants series by James P. Hogan -- first title is Inherit the Stars -- but it doesn't meet the criteria, having been first published in 1970.)

- Another vote for Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu",best science fiction novel

22819,"I met Dom DeLuise a bunch of times when I was a kid. I guess he owned a house nearby, and he shopped at the same grocery store as my family. Every time I saw him he'd do little magic tricks and give me a two-dollar bill. Once he let me help him put his groceries in his car, and I almost crushed his tomatoes. He shouted ""Kyle, watch the tomatoes!"" and laughed. Guy liked his tomatoes. He was just a ridiculously sweet guy.",best celebrity
55740,"Malazan scares the hell out of me. Sounds like a LOT of complexity to get to the adventuring, but I never read it so I could be wrong??? I also don't have a lot of patience when it comes to reading and I suck at keeping track of a ton of characters, plots. 

I've heard mixed things about First Law. Some say there is no strong story, just more character stuff. Also heard there aren't really any monsters (besides the human kind). But again, I could be wrong. 

I'm looking for something more old fashioned quest-like, but with good characters and story and a real sense of peril. And of course fun fantastical beasts!",best action and adventure novel series

1572,"I'm in the San Francisco bay area (east bay). There's lots of Japanese restaurants around here that serve red bean or green tea ice cream (sometimes with sweet tempura batter, for a take on the baked alaska). The garlic ice cream was from down in Gilroy.

The first time I had ginger ice cream, though, wasn't in this area. It was at Morimoto's in Philly. It was served on a crisp sesame seed cookie and covered with a tea reduction sauce and slivers of baked lemon grass... tastiest desert I've ever had.",best ice cream flavor
