"Married, so I found a hot chick that is into gum disease...which means she'll dump me if I floss.  

Woohoo! I found a reason not to floss!"
"Sweet Jesus, I just wanna give you a hug, man."
"I'm a 33 year old professional and use the GR1 every day. The black bag is sleek, it has a bomb proof laptop sleeve, and the molle webbing makes it incredibly versatile. 

That said, I would have never been able to afford it in college. .."
Repeated a bunch but Mindhunter
Spinach stuffed paratha is possibly the greatest thing ever.
"Just wanted to point out that while sublime is really nice, it costs quite a bit. 

Notepad++ has a really old school interface. Not good or bad, really just a matter of preference. Also they recently had an issue with a vulnerable library, but that​ is probably fixed.

My personal favorite is vs code because of its clean interface and extendability."
"I'm upset that Ken Burns isn't on Netflix anymore. Jazz, prohibition, and the circus are *chefs kiss*
The Searchers is fantastic for true crime. 
I highly recommend Betting on Zero for how predatory MLMs are.
Jesus Camp if it's still on there. Indoctrination is scary, guys
Hot Girls wanted for a very eye opening look at the porn industry. 
And Catwalk is so fun and silly and fascinating. Also I can look at the face of the champion cat without laughing. It's like a 90 min long meme. Delightful."
I got lg 27gn750 like 2 days back from amazon for aed 1150. Ips panel with 1ms g2g and 240hz. Its a great budget monitor if anyone is looking.
"To the states that give out Hot Tamales, who hurt you?"
"Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Zero Dawn Horizon, Beyond:Two Souls, Uncharted 4, Tomb Raider"
"I'm looking for laptops and I've seen a Gateway laptop (owned by Acer) with specs a good amount better than other hp or dell ones at the same price.
I5 10th gen, 16gb Ram, and 256gb storage while others like a dell one has i3 10th gen, 4gb ram and 1TB of storage. Both for the same price.
It seems too good to be true so I'm asking: is the material used for the gateways any good? And are their battery packs decent?"
Is the tenth dentist named David Tennant?
"My EB experience is very different. In fact, I bought it after my cousin, a geologist/paleontologist recommended it after seeing it perform well for him over a few years at dig sites."
"Don't even need to go that far. TSA treats ammunition the same as a firearm, although I've heard the rounds must be in their own hard sided ammo box. So for the cost of a box of .22 and a $5 ammo holder, you should be able to check your TSA approved, locked hard case just as you would any other firearm."
Global Studies has about 50 people. Also Comedy (in SDA)  apparently has like 1 person.
Probably a stupid question but where should you spray Cologne? Skin or clothing?
"Well said. I see you mentioned the Economist and the NY Times in a comment. Do you, personally, feel those are the ones worth naming because they accomplish this?"
What is that red stuff next to your username? ..
"I wanted to look for a nice thin Sierra Blue case that matches my phone like how I got a nice midnight green for my 11 pro, but struggled to find one. 

Ended up getting this, transparent back matte:

Definitely don't leave santa barbara without trying a habit burger. And if you're looking for really good mexican food I highly suggest Del Pueblo. It's kind of a hole in the wall little restaurant but damn is it good. And it has a cool atmosphere.
You’re gonna be making a lot of enemies and destroying earbuds if your weapon of choice is piccolo
"It wasn’t awful but definitely did not live up to all the hype. At first it was really hard to understand what was going on. Eventually the plot started to make sense but, as others said, goes in a weird direction. Hard to explain without spoilers. 

Also, the worst part for me was the author’s prose. It was hard to read, not smooth or easy to read."
"[Mathematics for Machine Learning](http://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf) \- as suggested by u/ndha1995 in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9bsdcu/mathematics_for_machine_learning/). The book gives a rundown on intermediate concepts in Linear Algebra, Optimization Theory, and Probability Theory. Perfect for people wanting to find out what topics they need to study to prepare for a Machine Learning education/career."
"The Economist is the definition of mainstream economics, neoclassical + Keynesian macro. They are as biased as so far they follow modern economic thought"
