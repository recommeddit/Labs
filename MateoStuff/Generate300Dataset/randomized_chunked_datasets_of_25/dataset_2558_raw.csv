"Don't buy your cheap glasses in a store.

Buy high quality ones online from aliexpress.

Check out /r/FashionReps to see how good they are for $20-35 USD.

Anyone who says expensive name brand sunglasses are worth it simply hasn't bought good stuff from China."
"I prefer really spicy food, a nice walk outside and about 50 snotwipes. Really cleans your head out for a nice long time."
"Reminds me of the Sopranos

    Jimmy Altieri: I got enough cologne on?
    Christopher Moltisanti: You smell like Paco Rabanne crawled up your ass and died.
    Jimmy Altieri: Whoah, easy for you to say. I don't get young ones like before."
is this meant to be purely based on european achievements? if so i dont see why juve are so much higher than inter lol
"I had a pair but they got really badly scratched in like a week - I was taking care of them fine, they just got a few years worth of wear and tear extremely quickly, which sucks."
EmEditor. It can open big files and do all of the things that a text editor should be able to do.
Throw in MySql and you're good to go.  Build a solid portfolio before though; you're competing with 10s of thousands of developers who work for $15/hour. Don't let that stop you. If you're good and have a solid portfolio you'll have no trouble finding consistent work.
Unfortunately no longer a Ritz-Carlton hotel. Same owners as the Central Park hotel and it was loosing tons of money.
There's just way too much freedom and opportunity
"High Schoolers -- please consider a career in public health sciences! There is an enormous need for epidemiologists and biostatisticians, particularly ones with up-to-date coding and analysis skills. Data drives policy and great data can save lives."
"World Made by Hand by American James Kunstler was pretty good. Station Eleven was fantastic; I stayed up all night reading that one. Oryx and Crake was entertaining but I don't think it was all that deep; Handmaid's Tale was the kind of book that I sometimes have creepy dreams about and wake up sweating. The Road is iconic -- I read that one in the woods at night and got so freaked out that I hid from the fireflies. A Boy and His Dog is also, I mean, Harlan Ellison, dang... his short fiction is so weird and so warped. You can't go wrong with short stories by Ray Bradbury or James Tiptree either. Plus Tiptree is so feminist, I can't believe nobody figured out he was a woman for so long. Akira is like the most epic manga ever, plus the art is amazing. It took me forever to read because I spent so much time looking at all the details in the pictures.

Hm, maybe I read too much apocalyptic stuff... I think that Liebowitz was what started it back when I was in high school, plus I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."
Haha he did a swear so it's funny

Speech and language processing is a pretty good textbook (since you’re in the NLP field).
"Baked beans, I thinkthey are Haricot beans in a tomato sauce. Beans on Toast is probably the most popular dinner time meal in the UK. You could go even further with beans on cheese on toast, or egg on beans on cheese on toast...it can go on forever."
"Don't give out Dum Dum pops.  I hated every house I went to that gave those out.  All I could think was ""Really?  You couldn't spring for the Tootsie Roll pops?  Maybe the mixed bags of name brand candies?""

I still hate dum dums.  They're just so cheap and awful.  When I want to give an analogy of something cheap and low quality I use Dum Dum pops, so I don't actually have an analogy for them.

**tl;dr: Don't give out Dum Dum pops.**"
I've never had someone be unhappy when I made them their first Aviation.  I consider that drink the bridge to craft cocktail nerdiness.
"Never received one packaged like that, but good luck."
"He's not saying Genesis Owusu is like Death Grips.

He's saying that this subreddit considers DG to be alternative hip hop, and thus Genesis Owusu may as well too."
"I don’t feel bad handling in RWD Model 3, it is very different than Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf."
I don't think that there is a better sub $400 laptop.
"Thanks, I’ll probably try the Elecom first to see if the picture quality is good enough for me, and if not then I’ll try Paperlike"
"That helps a lot actually, thanks. Constructive posts like this are what really contribute to the general well-being and growth of a community."
"Whichever sketchbook you get, it's best if it says 'acid free' on the cover. That has to do with the longevity of the paper. You will also want to take note of the poundage. The lower the pounds, the thinner the paper. I like 90lb. & above. (for reference, tracing paper is 25lb.) 50lb. is so thin I feel I will rip the paper.

As someone else said, Strathmore is a good brand. Might also want to pick up some newsprint. It degrades quickly but it's super cheap & is used for studies. I saw a newsprint pad that was $2 for 100 sheets. Don't buy Royal Langnickle. It's cheap but you can't erase & it is not acid free.

For pencils, well, I don't like how graphite smears. (my first few sketchbooks were a mess & I could barely see what I drew) I recommend picking up a pack of Mitsubishi colored pencils that are 1/2 red & 1/2 blue: http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Mitsubishi-Vermilion-and-Prussian-Blue-Pencil-5-5-Hexagonal-Body-Pack-of-12/pd/5161 or Prismacolor Col-erase: http://www.prismacolor.com/products/colored-pencils/col-erase .

Neither of these will smudge. You can undersketch in a light color & tighten the lines in a darker color. Both have hard pigments so you can get them to a nice point. Plus, pretty colors! You can sketch in aqua & purple or pink & red or whatever, & it's just delightful."
This guy didn't just not use a cutting board... he apparently took the knife out of the store to a bench out back and was cutting something up on the bench...  wtf?
