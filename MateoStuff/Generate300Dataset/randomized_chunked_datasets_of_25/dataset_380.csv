39007,"I used to use Chrome until a few months ago, Edge has been my default now. Why? First of all, its Chromium based, so that's already a plus. Second, it has extension support from the Chrome Web Store too, and it uses less memory. It also has a very simple security gui, and it has ad-blocker enabled by default!",best web browser

The newer PaperLike ones don’t impact the color as much, but it is noticeable at times. Also keep in mind that they will wear out the nib faster. But if you really want that texture while writing, try it out.",best matte screen protector for ipad

41048,"Huh.  Well, there’s two major points for this argument usually.  Which instrument is the easiest to learn to play, and which instrument is the easiest to actually get good at.  Piano is the easiest to learn basic skills on.  One straight line of keys that rise in pitch as you go from left to right.  Just about anyone can learn a couple basic songs on piano given a few weeks.  (Not a feat you could learn on say, a wind instrument, where you’d struggle to make so much as a consistent sound).  The easiest to get good at comes down to natural physiology (at least for winds).  Mouths are built certain ways, some instruments will come more naturally than others.  This extends to advanced skills.",best instrument to play

56399,"I just upgraded my Omen 27i (27"" 1440p 165Hz 1ms nano IPS) to the Acer Predator XB273U GX (27"" 1440p 270Hz 1ms IPS). Like you, I was considering the AW and G7. I ruled out the G7 due to all the complaints and I was heavily leaning towards getting the AW. Even though I love gsync, I stopped using it for FPS games so I decided I wanted to try out ULMB which was presumably the best on the Acer (and not available on the AW). Pretty happy with my decision so far.

For competitive FPS, the higher refresh rate and reduced motion blur due to ULMB honestly feels like cheating. As soon as I snap onto heads, the image is instantly clear. Contrast that to a hint of smearing/ghosting when I did the same on the Omen.

I don't want to exaggerate so maybe not everyone will feel like the Acer is an upgrade. However, the Omen definitely feels like a downgrade in comparison (though, at the time, it felt like a considerable upgrade over my 1440p 100Hz 8ms VA ultrawide).",best desktop monitor
