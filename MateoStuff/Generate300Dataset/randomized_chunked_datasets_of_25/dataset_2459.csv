8734,best toothpaste,"I guess that makes sense.  Bacteria probably can’t do much against teeth as long as there’s a protective coating there, but getting into the gum line is like tunneling under a castle wall.  Not a dentist, so if I’m totally off, please let me know."
37269,best amusement park,"I went back and forth on what word to use. ""Lowesr rank by popularity?"" Lol. 

I actually love the helix at the end of Gemini and wish it was used more often. It's the perfect amount of force imo"

18707,best YouTube video,"[Abroad in Japan](https://www.youtube.com/user/cmbroad44)

British dude moved to Japan, and his channel is a kind of travel documentary for the country. I binge watched a bunch of videos a few weeks back, and it really made me wanna travel to Japan.

The guy has gained some popularity for his tour of [Japanese Love Hotels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXgX_r-x-XE) and for his video on [teaching Japanese people to swear in English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9-OWfS2Vy4). I also found his video on the [Robot Dinosaur Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9DBb-Eng20) to be a pretty good watch."
29976,best money managing app,"If you don't have enough willpower to not click on every as you come across, that's on you."
55546,best action and adventure novel series,"Standard advice on this one: if the first couple of chapters feel too dry and boring, *do not give up.* This is a book that gets ever so slightly more epic with each chapter, so the beginning is not representative of the awesome, world-shaking magical stuff that happens in the last third or so. It's a slow buildup, be patient.

The jokes, the characters, the style, and the worldbuilding are, by contrast, absolutely perfect, front to back."
64692,Best Nike running shoes,"Yeah I have the 3.0's and love them!  Plus I can just wash them when they start to stink no problem.  Gentle cold and hang dry (over my hepa filter blowing cool air into them).  Fit no snug I don't even tie them on tight since they are like aqua socks.

I thought it was shoes giving me issues every attempt at learning to like running and always had pain under my arch on the inside of the foot.  Felt like a cracking bone or something.  Then I did the bone fracture tests I found online and they said it's the tendon right there (planar fascitlisilshs or something like that) and recommended the tennis ball.  Everything has been gravy since I found out about the tennis ball.   One at my desk, one in the bathroom for when I'm pooping, and one next to the couch.  

Up to 6 miles a week now (4th week of running ever, first week could barely do a mile)."
47112,best state to visit in the United States,"[Redwoods](http://i.imgur.com/JS8fW.jpg). I live in Vermont, and the redwoods and giant sequoias in California are the closest thing I can think to being on another planet. It truly is another land. Being there will positively inspire anyone with a soul, and certainly plenty of people who don't believe in them.

22348,best celebrity,"My mom and sister met the Rock when he was still a wrestler. They had a couple car seats and tons of bags having a hell of a time getting off the plane and people were waiting and then this massive guy offered to carry some things for them and they happily took the help, he grabbed some bags and held the baby carrier with my niece in it and helped them off the plane and left. After people kept going up to them asking how they knew the rock and they were very confused until someone explained who he was."
14725,best romantic novel,"The Gargoyle by Andrew Davidson. 

I wouldn't say it was explicitly a romance novel but it has a very strong romance/love storyline. Just to give you a preview, the books follows the main character (I don't think you ever know his name) who gets very seriously burned in a car accident during the first couple of chapters. The book follows his recovery in the burn ward (very graphic but very good and honestly one of my favorite parts) where he meets a woman named Marianne who, over the course of the book, retells the story of *their* past life (as in they knew other in their past lives - and by past I mean medieval Germany) and also 3 other amazing stories which also have kind of a love theme. 

I definitely recommend it. To my knowledge, Davidson has not written anything since and I think it's because he is very detail oriented. He spent years researching burn units and all different aspects of medieval Germany in addition to everything else the book includes over the course of many years."
