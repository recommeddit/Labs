"I forgot about the handhelds, but I was talking about home consoles.

There are quite a few PSP games that are playable on PS3 as PSP Minis that you can download on the PlayStation Store. With homebrew, you can expose this emulator and load your own games, but compatibility is kinda poor.

The iPhone 6S was a champ! Iâ€™ve moved on now to a newer iPhone model but I still look back at the 6S fondly.
I just think its funny that the Invisible Guest and the Invisible Guardian are both Spanish language crime thrillers.
