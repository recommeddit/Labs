32503,best vacation resort,"I stayed at the Riu Santa Fe and we had a fridge stocked with beer and soda and the liquor dispenser thing.  It wasn't at fancy as the palace true, but it was totally fine.  Plus we got good service.  And the deal we got couldn't be beat, 625 for airfare and 5 days 4 nights at the resort.  The only issue I had was a maid broke an expensive bottle of foundation and had to argue a bit that it wasn't already broken and that they should reimburse me, which they did"
56332,best desktop monitor,"I ended up going for the Dell S2721DGF. It was on sale where I live and I got an additional discount on it, so I got the monitor for €420 delivered. 

I was set on getting the MSI MAG274QRD-QD but the cheapest I could find it was €680 which is too expensive for me currently. Also I looked at a lot of reviews for both monitors and the MSI seems to be the best one but the Dell is also meant to be excellent too and was a good bit cheaper."

30462,best Mexican war to study,"No love for the 30 year war? Great leaders; military innovation; massive carnage, with entire cities depopulated; religious ideology mixed with cynical realpolitik, with sinister French clerics manipulating other players to prolong the carnage and pave the way for France's rise; a settlement which not only changed the balance of power and redrew the borders of Europe, but redefined the meaning of the state. Plenty of wars outside Europe too."

54840,best water filter,"I absolute and utterly agree with thechemistree.  


It is hard to answer if ""water will be safe"" when you know nothing about the water quality going in. Which brings me to a pet peeve of mine, and it is how little most people know about their water and where it comes from."

65566,best phone service company,Bruh Verizon sucks ass. They need to get more satellites or towers here.
4704,best home improvement store,"I didn't pay the extra $30 for a water line, was just going to ""install"" the fridge myself after they delivered.  Lowes' delivery guys said they had an extra, and insisted on installing it for me.  They did an awesome job and were very careful and clean in my new house!"
