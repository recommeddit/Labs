33507,best electric car,"> Tesla really does build a better electric car than everyone else so far

Not sure about ""a better electric car"" so much as ""a better electric vehicle ownership experience.""  Competitors are starting to get close to Tesla's real-world ranges, and although FSD is still among the most capable driver assist systems out there, automakers have long caught up to the capabilities of regular AutoPilot, and some are even catching FSD (ex. SuperCruise).

Tesla's greatest advantages have always been factors beyond the vehicle itself, and they remain as unchallenged as ever there despite the specs of rival EVs closing the gap.  The charging network is the best example: there's enough of them that you can roam the entire Interstate system in the lower 48 states without worry of being stranded, and it's only getting better as they continue to expand the network.  Only something on that scale can truly alleviate people's range anxiety - other automakers can claim it's an overstated concern all they want, but ultimately you should be playing around the consumer's mindset rather than trying to fight them.

The other often-touted advantages like OTA updates and the order-only purchasing model may still be Tesla-exclusive for now, but they don't require an EV to be implemented.  Other companies are already jumping on the OTA update train, and although it would take a near-herculean effort for legacies to cast off dealerships, that's pretty much the only obstacle for legacies to switch to Tesla's model."

But my experience with cases (both expensive or cheaper ones) is that they get old and dirty from daily usage eg. in and out of pockets multiple times a day, rather that the simulated drops shown in reviews."

While my boss is looking everywhere for scrap wood large enough to write a list of measurements down on and take it to Home Depot, I’ve got a notebook in my pocket for measurements, appointments, the occasional random thought, and less serious things like character builds for video games or deck ideas for MTG.

Had one go through the laundry and it’s too wrinkled to write on now, but it’s still legible. They definitely work."

69626,best major to study in college,"If you don't plan on getting at least a masters degree, avoid psychology. I've known several servers, bartenders, and receptionists that have their degree in psychology. Even a few that have ended up in retail. Not that I look down on those jobs, just that they clearly don't require a psychology degree. To get a job in the field you pretty much need to have a masters at least."

My parents don't have that much money for frivolous things, but mum really wants to start tidying up their house so they can sell it at some point. So I've just started giving her money that HAS to be used on house stuff - so she can feel free to spend ""wastefully"" on new light fixtures, or a new toilet seal, paint, etc. My mum isn't that effusive, emotionally, but she still likes to point out how useful the new pot rack is, or how she got new paint for the bathroom, so I know she's really very happy to have the money for those things."

 I see people tell others to get these expensive mics and setups in the podcast world when someone says that they are just starting. There is nothing wrong with starting off with inexpensive equipment, as like you said, if streaming or podcasting isn't for you, then you aren't out that much."
