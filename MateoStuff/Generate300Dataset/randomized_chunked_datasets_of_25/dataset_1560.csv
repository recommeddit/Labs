47219,"Dude, I have a BA in Geography and have been to damn-near every state in this country (not to mention, I've lived in 8 of them), but you're going to have to help me out.

Not picking on you, but you just said the equivalent of ""I want to go to Europe, see some cathedrals, watch a soccer game, eat pastries and go drinking"". 

BBQ, Football, Drinking and Theme Parks cover about 45% of this country, and that's a lot of country. Since you'd have to travel in the fall to see Football, can you answer a few more questions?

The BBQ, by the way, is the best for breaking it down. I could send you to Ohio for the other things. That would not be very nice of me. 

Football season is from September to December (plus January - sort of. Whatever). When can you go? Denver, for example, is a very different place in September than it is in December. VERY DIFFERENT.

But let's break down just a few more things:

Do you care about the outdoors/pretty scenery? If so, what kind? Lakes? Mountains? Rivers? Etc.

What kind of weather do you like?

Can you give a general timeframe (How long) and budget? You can even message them to me if you don't want that to be public, but yeah. Big country here.",best state to visit in the United States

My husband has never read any of the books - and has only seen two of the movies, and never really paid attention to either of them.

At the time of your comment, I am literally taking a couple minutes  break from reading The Sorcerer 's Stone to him. We're just now getting to the part where Harry and Ron first meet on the train.

33546,">	The ride is so much more comfortable, especially with passengers in the back. I've been getting about 3.6 kWh but I've also been driving in B Eco mode and have been driving EVs since 2011 and have learned how to maximize efficiency.

Iâ€™ve discovered recently that unless youâ€™re in a city, the best mode is D mode and then let the car coast to a light or exit. I added a lot of range and it was a much easier driveâ€¦I encourage you to try it, with and without ACC, and youâ€™ll likely never go back to B mode. 

I mentioned ACC - if you are on slower roads (80kph/50mph) like me and have circles where traffic mixes, I find without ACC better. One the footpedal light comes on in the binnacle display over the steering wheel, let off the gas â€” it knows the distance to the circle and all that lovely regen comes flooding back, much more than if you raced to it and braked.",best electric car

By far the best hotel I have ever experienced in the world was the Oberoi in Gurgaon, India. This is the tech city near Mumbai, where most fortune500 companies have an office, so this hotel is made for executives to enjoy a remarkable experience.

Next after this is a Hotel in Tenerife, Spain, Bahia del Duque. 

Next would probably be the Dorchester in London.",best hotel to live in
