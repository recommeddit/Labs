14756,best romantic novel,"Reading this right now. So intense, so good. She is a phenomenal writer IMO."
66388,best soccer team in the world,Yeah.
43739,best items under $100,My dentist recommended I get one and I keep putting it off. Is it really that much better than normal flossing?
16301,best sunglasses for fashion,"I've never understood the point of fake Wayfarers. The shape is always completely different in terms of how they sit on the face, with Wayfarers having quite a sharp angle towards the cheekbones. Real Wayfarers are legitimately the only sunglasses I've ever tried that suit my face."
47219,best state to visit in the United States,"Dude, I have a BA in Geography and have been to damn-near every state in this country (not to mention, I've lived in 8 of them), but you're going to have to help me out.

Not picking on you, but you just said the equivalent of ""I want to go to Europe, see some cathedrals, watch a soccer game, eat pastries and go drinking"". 

BBQ, Football, Drinking and Theme Parks cover about 45% of this country, and that's a lot of country. Since you'd have to travel in the fall to see Football, can you answer a few more questions?

The BBQ, by the way, is the best for breaking it down. I could send you to Ohio for the other things. That would not be very nice of me. 

Football season is from September to December (plus January - sort of. Whatever). When can you go? Denver, for example, is a very different place in September than it is in December. VERY DIFFERENT.

But let's break down just a few more things:

Do you care about the outdoors/pretty scenery? If so, what kind? Lakes? Mountains? Rivers? Etc.

What kind of weather do you like?

Can you give a general timeframe (How long) and budget? You can even message them to me if you don't want that to be public, but yeah. Big country here."
23800,best car racing video game,what a cool trick I dont even think about it
55564,best action and adventure novel series,"Haha funny you should mention this. I grew up reading Harry Potter, like many others. It was what made me love reading in the first place.

My husband has never read any of the books - and has only seen two of the movies, and never really paid attention to either of them.

At the time of your comment, I am literally taking a couple minutes  break from reading The Sorcerer 's Stone to him. We're just now getting to the part where Harry and Ron first meet on the train. I am so excited to relive this awesome journey with him experiencing it for the first time."
30192,best Mexican war to study,It isnâ€™t
15507,best tree for the garden,"Does loquat manage ok with little maintenance, it sounds very exotic?"
56756,best desktop monitor,"Not sure if Overwatch counts as fast paced, but I haven't noticed any of the things you've mentioned while playing it quite competitively for about 40 hours so far."
22800,best celebrity,"I've told this story a couple of times on reddit, but I'll give a short version.

When he was filming The Fugitive in Dillsboro, NC, he was just an all around asshole to the locals. He also nearly started a forest fire with a discarded cigar, and when it was mentioned to him he said that someone ""less important"" than him could deal with it."
45078,best items under $100,Cheap Casio wrist watch that I had for my entire middle/highschool. Helped me get an appreciation for watches and other fine crafts later in life.
60364,Best comedy show on Netflix,Try friends from college. Surprisingly funny
54470,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Iâ€™m in the same boat as u/kjuy14 Iâ€™ve only ever used qck heavy, Logitech g40 and Zowie gsr. Do you recommend soft or medium firmness?"
40857,best instrument to play,"Likewise - I'm a semi-professional musician, and none of the people I've dated were at all musical.  One of them dabbled a bit with the recorder, but that's about it.  

I dream of meeting someone to play four-hand piano duets with..."
25438,best cricket teams of all time,Same with Bradman and Smith
26110,best politician,And he forced the armed services to be racially integrated which was wildly unpopular with the military and public at the time.  One of the many steps leading to the civil rights act decades later.
65533,best phone service company,"Worked fine for me when I was in the dorms.  I think I was room 334 (faced golf course/street), never had any problems."
51272,best iphone case,Nomad leather?  Have you used them before?  I think Iâ€™m leaning that way as well
40231,best midrange CPU,"If they did that they wouldn't be testing the CPU, they'd be testing the GPU."
27637,best bollywood actor,OMG YES abhay is so cute. With a beard man he looks so daddy! In Zero he looked amazing I was like ðŸ¤¤
28969,best breakfast foods,"Yusss, shakshuka is one of my go-to brunch dishes when I need to feed a crowd. 

Or just me. 

I pair it with some toasted bread that I grill up on a griddle with a touch of olive oil. I hate wasting food and usually recycle the leftover sauce (if there *is* any left) for an easy pasta dish for dinner that night."
33546,best electric car,">	The ride is so much more comfortable, especially with passengers in the back. I've been getting about 3.6 kWh but I've also been driving in B Eco mode and have been driving EVs since 2011 and have learned how to maximize efficiency.

Iâ€™ve discovered recently that unless youâ€™re in a city, the best mode is D mode and then let the car coast to a light or exit. I added a lot of range and it was a much easier driveâ€¦I encourage you to try it, with and without ACC, and youâ€™ll likely never go back to B mode. 

I mentioned ACC - if you are on slower roads (80kph/50mph) like me and have circles where traffic mixes, I find without ACC better. One the footpedal light comes on in the binnacle display over the steering wheel, let off the gas â€” it knows the distance to the circle and all that lovely regen comes flooding back, much more than if you raced to it and braked."
31490,best hotel to live in,"I spent 5 years living in hotels around the world due to work. All five stars, unlimited budget. 

By far the best hotel I have ever experienced in the world was the Oberoi in Gurgaon, India. This is the tech city near Mumbai, where most fortune500 companies have an office, so this hotel is made for executives to enjoy a remarkable experience.

Next after this is a Hotel in Tenerife, Spain, Bahia del Duque. 

Next would probably be the Dorchester in London."
38556,best newspapers to read,"Because my work involves sitting in front of the computer fulltime it's refreshing to read a physical copy of the newspaper on Sundays (for me NY Times). Plus coupons are nice. 

I do miss the comics section from the paper (Calvin and Hobbes, Far Side - peace be unto them) though."
