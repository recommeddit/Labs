67788,axios alternatives reddit,"2020 certainly seems a lot better for the project than 2019 was, but I still personally know a handful of unfixed bugs (many with PRs open to fix) that are rather high visibility... See the charts https://github.com/axios/axios/graphs/contributors"

48463,best color to paint with,Our entire house was painted in Benjamin Moore’s Soft Chamois before we moved in. The house was built in the 1920s and I think the color fits a vintage vibe. It’s a warm off white that’s classic and doesn’t look dull or dingy.

12101,best gifts for dad,"So an Irish guy picks up this old lamp and proceeded to wipe away the tarnish on it. Out comes a genie and says that he may have three wishes. The man thought for a second and asks for an eternally re-filling bottle of the world's best beer. The genie complies and the man drinks the bottle almost instantaneously. The genie asks for his two other wishes and the Irishman replies, get me  two more bottles of that same beer."

14660,best romantic novel,"> First off, a lot of books are poorly written and not particularly imaginative, 

This is really what I was wondering. 

I was also wondering, if this is what they publish, how awful are the things they *don't* publish?"
5192,best home improvement store,"Lowe's appliance delivery is shameful and their lumber is mediocre.  
  
However, Lowe's employees generally leave me the fuck alone, which I prefer. They also picked up the hot dog cart guy's contract when HD canceled it a few years ago."
10096,best pencil for drawing,"Like graphite pencils? I always preffered [graphite holders like this](http://www.amazon.com/Staedtler-Mars-STD780C-Lead-Holder/dp/B0006HXM8O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1387915115&sr=8-2&keywords=graphite+holder) though there are much cheaper ones that work fine.  They hold a point for a really long time and the graphite also lasts much longer than a pencil.  The graphite can be retracted back into the holder so that it doesnt snap while you are traveling with it like normal pencils sometimes do and one graphite holder can be used for many different types of graphite so it saves space. Not to mention I can get the pointiest sharpest ends ever after sharpening them. Like dangerously so. I have accidentally stabbed myself with mine many times. It gets really sharp, but the graphite is thick enough that the points dont snap very much.

The down side is you need a [special sharpener.] (http://www.amazon.com/Alvin-Rotary-Lead-Pointer-ANALP41/dp/B001DI8FSM/ref=pd_sim_op_3) At first you will probably snap a lot of graphite sticks, but its just getting the technique down right and it will stop being a problem. The big downside is that after you sharpen your pencil you need to empty out the sharpener immediately because they leak powdered graphite all over the place and its messy as fuck.  I had to keep a special ziplock back in my pencil holder just to keep the sharpener in and every time I fished it out I had graphite all over my hands. I ended up keeping a wad of tissue to shove into the reservoir of the graphite holder just so loose graphite wouldnt spill all over the place. I had to take the sharpener out of the back, take the tissue out of the sharpener, sharpen the pencil, empty the holder  put the tissue back in it and then put the sharpener back in the bag.  

So its not perfect for traveling, but over all better than a pencil."
53149,best hiphop album,"Yoo , cheers. I fucking loved this project and posted it here when it dropped but it got no love. Looks like he’s been putting in serious studio time with Loyle Carner who is one of my favourite hip hop artists at the moment (check out his two albums if you haven’t, they’re fantastic) REALLY excited for whatever they’ve been working on."
44583,best items under $100,One of those battery packs to jumpstart your car. I bought one a few years back and keep it in the car. Have used it to not only jump my own car but several other folks in need of help. Also bought one for my son for peace if mind. He also has used his numerous times. It can also charge phones and other small devices.
68655,best science fiction novel,"Try [this.](https://i.imgur.com/6S38gEd.jpg)

It's more of an intro to SciFi, if you like X theme, try Y.  And sure it's missing a few of my favorites like Neuromancer and Hyperion... but it's a pretty solid little guide."
