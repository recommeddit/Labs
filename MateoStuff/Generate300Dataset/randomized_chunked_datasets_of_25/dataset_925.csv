55730,best action and adventure novel series,Tried and didn’t get too far into book one. But that was also my first fantasy book so it just seemed weird and it seemed like the writing was too drawn out. I don’t mind a little slow burn if it’s interesting. But there was just a too much stuff I found hard to care about. Didn’t give a big chance though I admit. Does it eventually check all of my boxes?

24607,best anime,"So it looks like you have mainly stuck to the basic shounen and senien which is pretty common starting out I would suggest branching out into some different genres such as comedy or romance or just slice of life

I would suggest some things like March comes like a lion, clannad, your lie in april, bunny girl senpai, the monogatori series, made in abyss, Haikyu (trust me sports anime are dope), and death parade 

Although some of those more mellow types of anime aren't for everyone if you want to watch whatever anime is currently airing and has the word isekai in the title go ahead and enjoy that."

12753,best gifts for mom,"My kids were upset they were so mad at me. ""Mom, sometimes I feel like I just hate you and then I feel so terrible!""  I explained it was their job to separate from me and form their own personalities, so that feeling was normal. If they didn't hate me sometimes I'd worry about them.

Solved their problem, not mine. They were still little poops, but I knew it would pass. Just keep being a good model for them."
