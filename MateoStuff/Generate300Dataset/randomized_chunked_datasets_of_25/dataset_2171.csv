8207,best toothpaste,"> And floss, you lazy fucks. 

I floss about 3-4 times a week. My teeth are in bad shape because I have very little enamel left on them from years of excessive Pepsi drinking, but my dentist says he can tell I have good hygiene because I have so little plaque. Flossing FTW."
23349,best car racing video game,"> was the best and is still the best in terms of physics.

31755,best hotel to live in,"On one hand this sounds like the most awesome job ever, basically. 

But on the other hand...it does sound very lonely and very stagnant. If I lived in California I would come visit you and give you this hug that I feel so compelled to give. 

You should try to find some redditors in the area to have a drink with one night. Make some casual friends. :)"

12763,best gifts for mom,This sounds like it had less to do with the whole pattern deal and more with the fact that you seem involved in her life.
38388,best newspapers to read,"From a student reporter, thank you very much."
33213,best electric car,"I certainly understand that sentiment and agree with you in principle. I live in Dallas, TX and the drivers here are horrible and I know I would be terrified of people damaging my car. 

However, I have looked up used Teslas before and they seem to be about the same price as a new one. I don't really understand why that is, but they clearly have great resell value. So then I think to myself that I might as well just buy a new vehicle if they're about the same. The good thing about the Model 3 is that it's been out for a while and they have gotten most of the issues resolved."
35667,best alcoholic drink,"As a manager for a large liquor store I've had many nights experimenting....this is my mainstay now:

Fill a standard shaker with ice, 2 -1.5 oz shots of vodka (khortytsa mixes like a champ, hank birdwells rocks for 10 bucks, 1835 lonestsr vodka kicks ass, fuck Titos and their over priced sweet corn bs, reyka is my favorite....) Then three parts grapefruit juice to one part pineapple juice. Shake and pour out but don't stop, jiggle the shaker and you'll top the drink with this delicious foam that is a by product of the shaking process...."
68221,best science fiction novel,"I just finished Solaris and still processing what I think about it. I liked his points on humanity exploring space, and a different look at possible life forms. 

But I was also greatly annoyed with anger being Kelvin's immediate response to most everything. I think it's a disgusting human trait when person's first response is to defend their ego before even considering what someone was actually saying (or trying to say). I've dealt with enough people like that in life, and it's a turn off.

Plus there were a couple chapters that the author just seemed to dully babble on about symmetriads, asymmetriads, and other multiple theories. Just seemed like there was more in those chapters than was necessary for the plot and/or character development."
16769,best pet for toddlers,I’m always scared with parents these days claiming assault about something so simple as that.
67060,best places to skydive in california,"I did my first jump out of Taft, CA in the Central Valley.  

This isn't for everyone, but consider taking the additional ground course and jump solo.

While I've not jumped tandem with anyone, being in full control of my gear and landing made the experience very memorable.

During my descent, there were 2 guys falling with me to handle any sort of ""freak out"" I may have had.  Also, one additional camera man taking video.  I felt pretty well covered in the event that I froze and didn't pull my cord.  

Good luck, and DO opt for the pics / video.  The money will seem trivial later when you don't have those memories documented.  : )"

55142,best places to hike in the east coast,"Finished the AT earlier this month, you need to make time if you want to do it. 

Met so many people in towns who said they'd want to do it if they had the time.

Most of the people thru-hiking had quit their jobs."
