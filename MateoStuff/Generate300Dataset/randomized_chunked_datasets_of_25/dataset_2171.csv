33213,"I certainly understand that sentiment and agree with you in principle. I live in Dallas, TX and the drivers here are horrible and I know I would be terrified of people damaging my car. 

However, I have looked up used Teslas before and they seem to be about the same price as a new one. I don't really understand why that is, but they clearly have great resell value. So then I think to myself that I might as well just buy a new vehicle if they're about the same. The good thing about the Model 3 is that it's been out for a while and they have gotten most of the issues resolved.",best electric car

Fill a standard shaker with ice, 2 -1.5 oz shots of vodka (khortytsa mixes like a champ, hank birdwells rocks for 10 bucks, 1835 lonestsr vodka kicks ass, fuck Titos and their over priced sweet corn bs, reyka is my favorite....) Then three parts grapefruit juice to one part pineapple juice. Shake and pour out but don't stop, jiggle the shaker and you'll top the drink with this delicious foam that is a by product of the shaking process....",best alcoholic drink
68221,"I just finished Solaris and still processing what I think about it. I liked his points on humanity exploring space, and a different look at possible life forms. 

But I was also greatly annoyed with anger being Kelvin's immediate response to most everything. I think it's a disgusting human trait when person's first response is to defend their ego before even considering what someone was actually saying (or trying to say). I've dealt with enough people like that in life, and it's a turn off.

Plus there were a couple chapters that the author just seemed to dully babble on about symmetriads, asymmetriads, and other multiple theories. Just seemed like there was more in those chapters than was necessary for the plot and/or character development.",best science fiction novel

67060,"I did my first jump out of Taft, CA in the Central Valley.  

This isn't for everyone, but consider taking the additional ground course and jump solo.

While I've not jumped tandem with anyone, being in full control of my gear and landing made the experience very memorable.

During my descent, there were 2 guys falling with me to handle any sort of ""freak out"" I may have had.  Also, one additional camera man taking video.  I felt pretty well covered in the event that I froze and didn't pull my cord.  

Good luck, and DO opt for the pics / video.  The money will seem trivial later when you don't have those memories documented.  : )",best places to skydive in california
