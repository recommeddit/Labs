Not in this Europe here.
Would've been better if you didn't mention it.
"OMG Nalini Singh. All day every day. (sidenote: I so wanted to comment this on that amazing thread but I was late by like 11 hrs, so thank you for giving me a chance to do it here, haha)

But really Nalini Singh, must read. Contemporary, paranormal, urban fantasy, suspense thriller with a light romantic thread, you name it, Singh has written a book in it. Give me a request and I can dig up a Singh rec for you.

Any day now, I expect her to drop a historical romance and just complete my life, lol.. 

Also, Shelly Laurenston,  I wanna be her heroines when I grow up. Batshit insane, and truly terribly hilarious, and unapologetically violent. And her heroes are equally ridiculous.  I üòç her so much!!!!"

Some measures and a shopping trip later I own a bra two band sizes smaller and two cup sizes bigger. I didn't know how comfy a wired bra can be! No more empty cups when leaning forward or even lying down.

Edit to add: I actually cried when I got my first well-fitting bra. I don't have weird or ugly boobs (what I thought since puberty). I just had the wrong bra. Fifteen years later, I finally am content and feel sexy. And I wish this for every woman! Don't underestimate what a bra can do for your comfort AND self-esteem!"
Come to Minneapolis. It's really not that cold up here. It's incredibly nice on the summer.
You should play Devil May cry 5 or wait for the special edition. It's more like action driven then story driven. Not my cup of tea l.

"But this list is an all-time list, so therefore do we take into account the years in the 70‚Äôs/80‚Äôs where our roles were basically reversed? Think the question asked is abit too open"
"What a fun thread!  Thanks for feeding my TBR :)

I would say Cat Sebastian's Sedgwick series, I adore the whole thing.  The first book, It Takes Two to Tumble, is a gay regency Sound of Music, it is perfection."

They're open-ear so you should only use them at home and if your mom asks if you're damaging your hearing, tell her to get lost.

I wish I had my Grado 80's but my dog chewed all the earmuffs off and then my girlfriend kicked me out."
"STATS! *high five*

I don't think you have enough asterisks earmuffing how particular the circumstances you described are."
I appreciate that Vermont likes New York‚Äôs arguably worst theme park the best
"Grab some samples of various brands on eBay cheap, they'll last a while. Then once you get one you like, look out for sales then take the plunge"
I haven't been sick (with a cold or flu) in at least a decade. Honestly.

"James Corden. I was a porter at a hotel a very long time ago, he'd had a couple of very minor TV roles. I had no idea who he was but others did. He came down in the morning yelling at the receptionist that someone had taken vhs tapes from his room. He demanded to know who had access to his room, me being the only person on duty that night with a master key was pointed out and he proceeded to accuse me of sneaking into his room while he slept and stealing tapes. After ten minutes of verbal abuse and threats one of his ""people"" came in and told him they found his tapes in the car and he stormed out with so much as a goodbye. Throughly horrible human being."
"Puig's Quorum. Fantastic.  


Honourable mentions: the Arami--Amaris, Devin, Havana, 900, and Tuscany."
"[Light N Leisure](https://www.lightnleisure.com) has the best prices I‚Äôve seen on higher quality light fixtures and almost always runs discounts without brand exclusions.  Plus, since it‚Äôs a small company with only 3 physical stores, they are able to provide great customer service."
"By far, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle!"

"Have you used Angular with VSCode? Because I just couldn't without searching for this and that. Meanwhile, with WebStorm, right off the bat, it's compatible with Angular syntax and Typescript."
"Seems about right from an individual perspective   When it comes to the top 4, although Peyton Manning is way too low and he should be 5"

"I really, really, really want my husband to watch Sharktopus with me and buy me some liquor so I can drink heavily, then not make fun of me for having a hang over the next day."
