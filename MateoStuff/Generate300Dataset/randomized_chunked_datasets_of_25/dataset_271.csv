Bowlers are pretty interchangeable with the great allrounders of the 80s plus the great quicks of the 70s, 80s and 90s. But my top order is set in stone"
48274,best color to paint with,"This sounds like a horrible idea. The primary color of the room will be the wall color... and whatever is gonna be your primary color should be chosen first, then everything else to complement it.

Now maybe it would be a good idea to not choose the exact SHADE of paint until last, but you should know the HUE early on, I would think."

I’d say current are: Card Crawl, FAIF, Hue Ball, Jaipur, Morels, Solitairica, Good Sudoku, Chip Chain, Muertitos, Domino Drop, Dungelot, Horizon Chase, SpellTower, Hoplite, Really Bad Chess, Mini Metro, Desert Golfing, The Firm, Drop7, Black Paradox, Atomik, Call of Duty Mobile"
16329,best sunglasses for fashion,"yep haha. Everyone and their mother is posting ""Ray Ban!"" ""Maui Jim!"" but Tom Ford, Moscot, Garrett Leight, et cetera are my preferred options."
61674,Best RPG game on PS4,"+1 on 13 Sentinels. Give it a chance even if you’re not into VNs. I’m generally not, but this game is good. I couldn’t stop playing it."
31927,best hotel to live in,"Not hotels sorry. But I've been some pretty good results when booking for 4 weeks or more on AirBnB. Sometimes up to 60% off. 
I've been travelling through LATAM for 4 months now and it's worked pretty well."
60732,Best comedy show on Netflix,Almost forgot about this one. Probably one of the best shows I've ever seen. Great recommendation.
48367,best color to paint with,"I am not usually a fan of white because it always seems to look dingy. That being said, we are painting on a budget and ended up getting Lowes Valspar in Ultra White satin for a closet and loved it so much we are also using that in our bedroom."
56480,best desktop monitor,"One of the ones that aren't out yet from ViewSonic, ASUS, Aurous, Acer, or others I might be forgetting.32 inch 4k 144hz monitors this year with HDMI 2.1 this year. Id go with the PG32uq because I like the look and HDMI 2.1 the best shitty lineup this year because HDMI 2.1 is spotty. haven't really heard much about the gigabyte one."
58991,best perfume,I only smelled that one on a tester and I remember liking it. I should try it out again.  Thanks for the info.

36500,best alcoholic drink,"Martini Rossi is classic, but you know what's better? Dubonnet! It costs more but it's so worth it"
14634,best romantic novel,"You know I'm with you on the AJH recommendations! Oh, you want a funny hero? Opposites attract? Academic setting? BDSM in a way that'll shake up your entire conception of what BDSM even is? Erotic baking/Domesticity porn? A character who's a mess? A character taking care of that person who is a mess? Arguments that don't descend into petty drama but are actually thoughtful and build character arcs? A well-thought-through side plot with realistic character growth as a result? A plausible ""and then the entire room clapped"" scene? A sweet parental relationship? A horrible parental relationship that doesn't get implausibly tidied up with a bow at the end? A ridiculous place-name that can't be real, but maybe it is real, so you effing google it and then shake your fist at AJH for bamboozling you into googling 'Pucklethroop-in-the-Wold?' A volume of puns that should actually be illegal? There is an AJH book for that!

Also I really want a ""I went to Pucklethroop-in-the-Wold and all I got was this t-shirt"" T-shirt, just saying. 

I would say the only other author I'm as obsessed about recommending is L.M. Montgomery. For some reason I keep trying to sell people on Anne of Windy Poplars, objectively probably one of the weakest books in the whole series, because it's epistolary. And The Blue Castle, whose mention always brings my one-woman hype crew to the subreddit. And Rilla of Ingleside, which I genuinely think is an awesome, fun yet heartbreaking novel.

Also I recently read The Flatshare and it made me weep and it was pretty much perfect. My buddy read was just a stream of incoherent raving about how much I loved it to Canquilt. So expect to be seeing that in every single thread.

Also Song of Achilles. Though it seems most people come here already obsessed with it and wanting to know what to read next, at which we can only collectively shrug and apologize that there is nothing else like it."
72984,best Linux distro,What's so great about it? Genuine question

40759,best instrument to play,"Guitar. Its easier to play than some other instruments, and still has enough substance and compactness to allow you to do cool things, like spin it around and play it in awkward positions."
