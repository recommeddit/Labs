"I use mint as well, and while it's ko fault of their own, it's tedious when most of your accounts migrate to two factor authentication that keeps mint from auto updating."
Yea i have the magic keyboard but most of the time i take notes with my hand.
"I just placed an order with Barker a few weeks ago. I’m so pumped to get my cabinets! After watching some of their YouTube videos and getting a sample, I can’t imagine ordering particle board cabinets!"
I have 3. But maybe you are right...

"Thirded, I like to try and re-listen to GTD and GTD Fast (as audio books) once a year - usually spaced out so there's 6 months in between. I find them to be different enough that I learn different things and it certainly helps me stay on the wagon."
"I barely ever brush. Maybe once a week since I was 10 (I'm 20), had one cavity and great teeth otherwise and I never had braces whilst everyone in my family has them. Can someone explain this."
What's the appeal of quinine?  Taste?
I was told (by a water treatment plant worker who adds fluoride) that adults do not benefit from fluoride and it is useless to them.  But that children most definitely do.  Any truth to that?
"Warning: not activated charcoal. Repeated use (more than once per month!) will actually erode your enamel.

Edit: Source: My own dentist, all the dentists in articles, and the British Dental Journal [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0232-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0232-8) which in fact states there is zero whitening, they all lack fluoride, and it has risks from potential ingredients and complications.

It is NOT for daily use. Read the label. It is NOT safety approved for toothpaste.

Slight whitening may be seen due to abrading the enamel.

If you are going to test activated charcoal for your teeth, smear it. There is no point in brushing it.

Answer to best toothpaste: Apagard. Along with NovaMin.

"Damn, thats in-depth! kudos on the dilemma"
"This is the real feature. You *have* to use a non-tsa lock. That means tsa can't look inside and misplace something. 

Also losing a firearm is a big deal so you don't have to worry as much about them losing your luggage."
Pretty much anything by Insomnium
"I would have to say acoustic guitar, especially if it's played Flamenco style."
"aaah okay, mukang useful si labels sa mga graphs and reportings, i'll add that feature to my app. pati na din yung receipt photo :)"
"Zero soft is obviously much better quality, a lot more durable and has nice premium feel. It is also considerably faster with less stopping power. I prefer xsoft zero because it is a bit slower. But still faster than G640."
"I went to a Sunglass Hut last fall to get replacements for my 15 yr old Ray-Bans. All the Luxotica Ray-Bans were complete shit. They were all non optical quality poly lenses. They looked cheap as hell but still cost $200+. I didn't see any glass lenses in the styles I like, if there were any at all."

Can we plz have more sb memes? This is good stuff
"I mean, in some ways this is also likely to be skewed, albeit potentially in different ways. I cover methodology lightly at the end https://boardgamesquad.com/top-games-meta-list/#Notes_about_Data_Methodology_and_Changes_from_the_Previous_List

The basic idea of Borda is for a ranked list, say 1-10. The highest ranked is given a score of 10 and the lowest is given a score of 1. You can then essentially combines scores across lists to find an aggregation. There’s a little bit more to it in this case, but that’s the gist of the idea. I tried a method called CEMC that yielded slightly better results, but when the list got this large it became computationally impossible."
Just look at his receiving yards record. The difference between him and Fitzgerald (1st and 2nd all time) is greater than Fitzgerald and Keyshawn Johnson (2nd and 41st all time).
"Dude, bacon and eggs are the best. Eggs can go with basically anything depending on how you cook them as well. They're one of the best breakfast foods in my eyes."
"Final Fantasy IX is arguably the best one, you can't miss it 

DARK SOULS 1 and 3 --- just do it. It's difficulty is overhyped, its tough but fair and you DO adapt. There is a reason these games are so highly regarded, there is nothing quite like it

Dragon Age is absolutely brilliant, one of the best games you can play 

To that end, so is Mass Effect trilogy ( play all three, don't skip any) 

Horizon Zero Dawn is impressive more than you'd expect"
Same thing I looked for!
