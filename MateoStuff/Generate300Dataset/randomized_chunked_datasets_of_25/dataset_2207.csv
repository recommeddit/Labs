57992,best cologne,I didn’t plan on waking up and spending $80 on cologne today but this thread sold me on this one hahaha
17773,best Kardashian,"I would say: 

Khloe

Kim 

Kendall 

Kylie 

Kourtney 

Kris

I feel like Kim is probably more moral these days, but Khloe has been consistently before and after fame. She has her own set of issues forsure, but I get the sense that Khloe is a lot less elitist and judgmental than the rest of her family. She seems to have a lot of empathy and also seems to be the most likely to just be laid back and able to kick it with whomever. I get that sense from Kendall too, that she’s not as snobby as she comes off, and that she can kick it and have a good time without needing all the bells and whistles. 

Kim has come a long way these last 15 years. She’s always carried herself with grace and a strong sense of professionalism and politeness, but she had always been pretty self-centered until she started her philanthropic pursuits. I see Kylie as somewhere in the middle, she seems down to Earth and empathetic sometimes, but then so out of touch at the same time. 

Kourtney and Kris are the worst IMO, but for completely different reasons. Kourt is a brat who thinks she deserves to be treated better than others and looks down upon those less fortunate, Kris’ corruption is more on a person-to-person basis and affects her interpersonal relationships, it’s less about her views on the outside world."
18800,best YouTube video,This one about [galactic superclusters](http://youtu.be/rENyyRwxpHo) simply blows my mind.
59995,best perfume,"You just reminded me that I used to really like Revlon's Fire & Ice. I don't know if they still make it, but I haven't seen it in years and years and years."
6401,best Netflix documentary,"Marley

Amy"
69410,best major to study in college,"to get licensed, most states require 150 hours (with so many being in accounting), passing the exam, and 1-2 years experience  

basically, you need a bachelors in accounting, then a masters in tax or accounting.  my take is, the AICPA is trying to restrict the number of CPAs to boost earnings.  or trying to raise the 'prestige' of the profession.  i guess they got all insecure rubbing elbows with lawyers and their graduate degrees.  if undergrad accounting is fairly easy to you, graduate school is just more of the same"
1204,best ice cream flavor,"Though not my absolute favorite, Cherry Jubilee is underrated IMO"
37656,best Marvel movie,"This opinion is basically a meme on this sub and someone says it the second the movie is mentioned. Not saying it’s wrong or anything, but it’s just a certainty someone would say it."
73704,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I tried several matte screen protectors and decided that Elecom had the least grain. Even though it does have some grain, it was way, way less than PaperLike and some other matte screen protectors. Also the writing is stellar on it."
3704,best college for research,"The researchers are often university professors/lecturers, same as in the US. But in the US the university gets research grants and the researchers attribute their university in academic papers - while in Germany the institute (Max Planck Institute of XYZ) gets the grants and gets attributed in the research papers."
1696,best ice cream flavor,Coffee has my heart
47894,best color to paint with,"I live in the pacific northwest where skies are grey most of the time, it rains, and it's so far north there isn't much daylight in winter. I don't need that on the inside too."
68841,best science fiction novel,Well that review made it my next Audible pickup.
22664,best celebrity,"I'm not sure if this makes Joey Fatone a dick or not, but it's still a funny story. My friend and I were at a restaurant in Las Vegas and our server told us that Joey Fatone was in a booth around the corner. We were too shy to say anything so we just walked by him and his two friends. Somewhere between the booth and the elevator my friend gets up enough courage to yell ""I STILL LISTEN TO THE BACKSTREET BOYS!"" He yells ""THATS NICE!"" 

He was in 'N Sync...Not the Backstreet Boys."
47911,best color to paint with,Thank you! It was super easy to make & I infused the the terpinoid into the wood&finish so that the smell comes out when heated!

34813,best NFL player,It’s a QB award at this stage
15522,best tree for the garden,"If climate doesn't matter than plant coffee trees with exotic fruit trees and other edibles. Lychee, longan, rombutan, jabuticaba, cherimoya, avocados, dragonfruit, ice cream bean for fixing nitrogen and for the bean, moringa, macadamia nut, cacao, cinnamon, kava, ginger, and tumeric. The coffee will produce a good crop in 5 years to begin selling. Then the other trees and edibles will mature and if done correctly, something will always be available to harvest all year round for profits. A lot of the fruits, medicinals and edibles I listed go for top dollar even here in Hawaii. You can link up with a CSA, a farm to table chef, a health food store, a high end restaurant, local farmers market or even a gourmet food store and begin supplying them with fresh organic local exotics. Or get a certified kitchen and craft tasty treats to package and sell yourself. Organic macadamia nuts dipped in pure cacao sell for a crazy price. Heck even dragonfruits sell for quite a lot by the pound or single fruit. And kava once matured (10 years for the right cultivar) sells for a very high dollar amount for the raw root. And turmeric can be left unattended to grow large patches of rhizome that can easily be ground into powder and sold for good money too. A high quality avocado typically sells for $1 a piece. And with a mature tree you can be looking at thousands of dollars a year off of one tree."
47000,best hand santizer brand,will bleach kill a tardigrade?
37028,best roller coaster at six flags,">I don't think Cedar Point really has to use theming. It is just an amusment park. 

I never said CP needs to do theming, I said it's one of the worst parks that you could use as an example of good theming, because it doesn't have any."
31606,best hotel to live in,"St. Regis in Lhasa, Tibet"
72421,best keyboard switches,I love my cherry mx silent reds (also sometimes called pink). I like how reactive they are. I also don’t have to feel any bumps and hardly any sound.
21138,best workout music,I also assumed it was just a running joke. I can't even imagine trying to move weight while listening to Disney music.
