"This is a hard question to answer without knowing what you listen to, what you're looking for out of a headphone (comfort? Isolation? Portability? Doesn't matter as long as it sounds good?) and what your budget is. Plus, once you start getting near the $200 range for headphones you may run into a pair that needs an amp to really shine.  It gets expensive and a bit overwhelming real quick."

I like the sound profile at least in LDAC mode
"> Dark Souls and Bloodborne are definitely rpgs. You got many different builds and playstyles.

That doesn't make a game an RPG. You can have different builds and play styles in StarCraft or Civilization, but no one would consider those games RPGs. Dark Souls and Bloodborne are action games, through and through. 

HZD is also closer to an action adventure game, just a larger world. Its RPG elements are basically window dressing that don't impact any quests, missions, etc. The story will always start, progress, and end in the same manner with some very small dialog variations from Aloy. The game is still great, and I'm going to get the DLC for it, but an RPG it is not."
">the lack of Stankonia is surprising too.

Or ATLiens (I'm just a sucker for that album because it's how I 1st discovered Outkast)"
Those look good! Thank you!
"All of Eddings' books have magical enchanted objects and lots of time with a core group of people on the road travelling to do something or another. His books are all quest-related. No real monsters (some weird dogs and bears sometimes), but it's light-hearted and fun."

"Adding Hanabi and Android: Netrunner to my ""To buy"" list. I will research on others, thanks!"
"Ah yes, I see you are a man of many tears."
"Curious. How can you 'hate' python? One of the reasons it is so popular is because of how simple and easy to understand it is.

This is setting alarm bells ringing to me that you are rushing into this without fully understanding what you are doing."
I don't mind that kind of timeline but the bottom line is accounting is pretty math heavy isn't it? I could be wrong though

"Nobody has mentioned John Varley.

The Titan Trilogy is absolutely incredible."
"I found axios didn't work on it ie11 (unfortunately I have to support it still) so I switched to fetch with the whatwg-fetch polyfill and it works great.

Seems like a great library, but that was one downside I found with it."
"My flight from London Southend got cancelled. After getting over that, I was very happy with my free 4 person hotel room with bath, free dinner and breakfast. Think it was the Premiere Inn. Mostly fun because it was free"

We got the list cut down some but it has been hell trying to narrow things down. It's our first time visiting Cancun and we also want all inclusive / adults only."
Have you tried Kami? My kid’s math teacher is using it for virtual learning. She posts pdf worksheets that the kids can modify and submit back to her. The interface looks like it has the typical annotation tools. Maybe it would work for you?
Appreciate the info. I never got into space/planet stuff unfortunately.
