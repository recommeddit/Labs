34090,best NFL player,"Okay, I see your point. But longevity and the fact that the game was far different in that time has to play some part in the decision. I am not questioning that there are players out there possibly better than Rice was, but you made it seem as though he isn't, without question, which I believe is completely false. He was an incredible player and will always be regarded as one of, if not the, best player(s) of all time."

56433,best desktop monitor,I have the g7 and it does not have glow like the ips has and i also dont have issues looking at it from the side. Nothing that bothers me as much as ips glow does
9674,best dorm hall at UCSB,"FT has shared bathrooms between 2 rooms. Issue is that it’s a trek from campus (5-10 minute bike ride or 15-20 minute walk).

San Rafael suites are shared between a few people not too many. It’s closer to campus."
53990,best medicine for a cold,"I think it's the potassium? I'm on dialysis, they give me a big ol' list of stuff I'm not supposed to eat or drink because of either phosphorus, potassium, or sodium.  I know it's not the sodium for orange juice so it's one of the others. 

Either way, I get yelled at if the nurses and doctors find out, lol."

32164,best hotel to live in,"Best and not so good at the same time. 

The Livingstone hotel in Zambia. 

Awesome high tea, cocktail lounge next to Victoria Falls with day beds you can just fall asleep in. 

Luxurious rooms that you need to keep doors closed to prevent monkeys coming in and butler service. Zebras grazing through the grounds.

Not so good because the minute you walk out and see the poverty the average citizens are dealing with makes you really not want to stay there out of guilt. Also, butler service makes me uncomfortable. I also don't like how it's really keeping the colonial design, feel and service. It just.....doesn't sit well with me. 

So maybe, the actual best hotel is Nottens at Kruger National park. 

It's a small Safari Camp with awesome food, unlimited bar tab and great guides taking you out everyday to spot animals. Just make sure you don't get drunk there and forget to lock the door. A staff of theirs got eaten by hyenas because of that.

And maybe another one is Matsunoyama Tamakiya onsen hotel. Honestly, the best organic kaiseki meal I've ever had coupled with Niigata sake, private onsen bath with snow falling around you. The only downside is it's a hassle to get there.

Finally, my other favourite one would be Pangkor Laut resort and Seven Terraces in Penang. Pangkor Laut because you get to experience those cabins on stilts in the middle of the sea for a fraction of the price with great Malaysian food. Seven Terraces for the old time charm, afternoon tea and kuehs and great service."
7115,best iPhone,"All of Apples products could *still* work seamlessly together, there would just be competition.

The criticism is that no competition in the ecosystem is why the phones are priced so high, why 128Gb of storage costs a hundred and so on."
61339,Best RPG game on PS4,It works surprisingly well with a controller.
33355,best electric car,Value as in cheap? Or value as is best package for your money?
2943,best webcamera,"Additional in a meeting you don't want the best video quality for the participants. Number one is audio and number two is share screen quality.

When the quality of the audio and share screen drops I suggest to everyone to turn off their video."

67845,best science fiction novel,No love for *Excession*?
70582,best major to study in college,"Professional accountancy is a weird term; I'm guessing that means they maybe focus on more accounting electives so you have enough accounting credits to sit for the CPA exams. Information systems is really hot in the accounting world because a lot of accounting majors also perform IT audits. I would just speak to an adviser and research the requirements of the CPA exam for your specific state (every state is different unfortunately). 

Yeah, math is a big misconception for accounting. We did have to complete business calculus and a couple stats classes, though, but after that, smooth sailing lmao"
