34090,"Okay, I see your point. But longevity and the fact that the game was far different in that time has to play some part in the decision. I am not questioning that there are players out there possibly better than Rice was, but you made it seem as though he isn't, without question, which I believe is completely false. He was an incredible player and will always be regarded as one of, if not the, best player(s) of all time.",best NFL player

The Livingstone hotel in Zambia. 

Awesome high tea, cocktail lounge next to Victoria Falls with day beds you can just fall asleep in. 

Luxurious rooms that you need to keep doors closed to prevent monkeys coming in and butler service. Zebras grazing through the grounds.

Not so good because the minute you walk out and see the poverty the average citizens are dealing with makes you really not want to stay there out of guilt. Also, butler service makes me uncomfortable. I also don't like how it's really keeping the colonial design, feel and service. It just.....doesn't sit well with me. 

So maybe, the actual best hotel is Nottens at Kruger National park. 

It's a small Safari Camp with awesome food, unlimited bar tab and great guides taking you out everyday to spot animals. Just make sure you don't get drunk there and forget to lock the door. A staff of theirs got eaten by hyenas because of that.

And maybe another one is Matsunoyama Tamakiya onsen hotel. Honestly, the best organic kaiseki meal I've ever had coupled with Niigata sake, private onsen bath with snow falling around you. The only downside is it's a hassle to get there.

Finally, my other favourite one would be Pangkor Laut resort and Seven Terraces in Penang. Pangkor Laut because you get to experience those cabins on stilts in the middle of the sea for a fraction of the price with great Malaysian food. Seven Terraces for the old time charm, afternoon tea and kuehs and great service.",best hotel to live in

70582,"Professional accountancy is a weird term; I'm guessing that means they maybe focus on more accounting electives so you have enough accounting credits to sit for the CPA exams. Information systems is really hot in the accounting world because a lot of accounting majors also perform IT audits. I would just speak to an adviser and research the requirements of the CPA exam for your specific state (every state is different unfortunately). 

Yeah, math is a big misconception for accounting. We did have to complete business calculus and a couple stats classes, though, but after that, smooth sailing lmao",best major to study in college
