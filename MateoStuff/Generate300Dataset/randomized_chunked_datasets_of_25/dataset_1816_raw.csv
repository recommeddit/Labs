I've never heard of dehydrated hash browns. Picture or link? Sounds interesting.
White chocolate is the absence of chocolate. Blech.
I remember the alcohol opens up holes in the cell wall and allows water to pump into the cell bursting it. Is that right?
Telling myself I'm not going to do it. It's a method Dr. Gavin Free taught me.
"*Every newspaper in the house.* (All 3 of them). Every free newspaper on the street, and my University's newspaper. I'm weird. I even read all the ads.

"If youre taking notes im pretty sure you wouldn’t be focused on the screen’s quality that much (or in my case I’m not really paying attention to it at all), you can start off with a matte and see how you like it and if you hate it then just take it off and go with glass. 

Notes on glass sucks but you end up getting used to it after a while; I’ve gone from matte to glass to matte just cause I hated writing on the glass. I could care less about how the screen looks cause my eyes do adjust and it’s barely noticeable.. 

My advice since you said mainly for notes: matte :)"
