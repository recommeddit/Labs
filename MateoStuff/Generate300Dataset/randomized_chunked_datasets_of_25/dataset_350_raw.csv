">Futureproof - to have support and updates for at least 4-5 years.

I'll address this one particular issue: Support and updates. Assuming you don't really want to perform the (free) upgrades and want to stick with one version for maximum stability and consistency:

Mint and Ubuntu current LTS (Long term Support) versions will get mainstream support until April 2025. However, for Ubuntu you can sign up for free ESM (Extended Security Maintenance) for up to three devices, which takes it to 2030.

Debian 11 'Bullseye' gets official support until late 2024 but should get community support until 2026.

However, stable/LTS versions will mostly only get security fixes and you may find you need to upgrade to get up to date versions of applications, though there are ways round this.

I'd just add that Debian is a bit more advanced, for example there are more installer options and less hand-holding; Both Mint and Ubuntu are a bit more friendly for beginners."
