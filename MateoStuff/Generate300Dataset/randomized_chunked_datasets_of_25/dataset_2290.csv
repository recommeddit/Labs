As a grad student though with already 50k in debt i get the value of USC (I'm a big believer in the power of networking). The amazing thing is how comparable the prices are for graduate studies at the UC schools vs the big private ones, it's a little depressing. Like UCSD is ~60k for the year program and USC is close to that.",best college in california

169,"This has been asked in other subreddits as well but unfortunately I only tried `mc` very briefly just to see what it's like. I know it has a dual panel design and you can enter shell commands directly by typing I think. For `lf` dual panel can be achieved by using `tmux` for multiplexing. I have something about this in the example config file in the repo. In `lf` in order to run shell commands you need to type a key first (e.g. `!`, `$` and `&`). Other than that, there is some support for autocompletion for shell commands which I don't remember if `mc` has or not.

`lf` is more comparable to `ranger` though and I have a comparison for it in here:

Maybe if there is a comparison between `mc` and `ranger` somewhere, that could help.",best terminal file manager reddit
