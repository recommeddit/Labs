As an aviation major it’s looking kinda bleak right now ngl
All hail me
I’m not sure what you mean by this comment. Did you confuse axios with bluebird?
"Love it. Just rewatched the series. I was bummed it ended bc it could've gone on, but I loved how they ended it."
*Stronger
People are seriously believing your *hadn't* bullshit. I'm giving you an upvote on that alone.
Murdoch Mysteries?
Korea was a UN sanctioned war if that means anything
glad to see t440 still getting some love. mine is going strong 7 years later!
This is my favorite. Also best lunch deal
YSL Black Opium and people always compliment me when I wear VS- Tease
I scoured this thread looking for my ex boyfriend's cologne so I could think about him and be sad.
"I have 2 teenage stepsons and an infant.

For Mother's Day, I'd really like my kids to show in their own little way that they think of me as an individual that loves them instead of a maid/chauffeur/chef/babysitter.

I'd like a day off from cooking/cleaning/taxi service. 

I'd like a meal centered on things that I like to eat instead of a meal centered on avoiding the foods that my kids turn their nose up at.  I love mushrooms and haven't cooked any in the last 5 years.

I'd like to have some time where we sit down and enjoy each other's company.  We can do this at meal time, as long as there's no name calling, intimidating, or condescending remarks between the teenage boys.  Or a board/card game.  Or just sitting on the couch chatting.  Or a trip to the park.  

I'd love a thoughtful gift.  This could be a letter, a hand made something, or something store bought.  I'd like something tangible to keep as a touchstone to remind myself of the mutual love that is the foundation of our relationship during the weeks/months when it feels like the only conversation my kids want to have with me is ""What's for dinner?""

EDIT: 
Who would have thought mushrooms would be so controversial?  To be fair, my kids don't ""turn their noses up"" at food any more.  They've become generally respectful, thoughtful young men (as long as their not dealing with *each other*, but show me teenage brothers that are loving and caring to each other -*amiright?*)  They each have their own way of dealing with food they hate - like broccoli.  My youngest will put it off until the end of dinner and drown it in Ranch.  The oldest will eat it first, followed by a big bite of his favorite part of the dinner - as a reward for biting the bullet on the broccoli.  These are silent, unobtrusive rituals that have crept into our dinner routine that they think go unnoticed.  I, in turn, don't call them out on it because they're trying to be polite and respectful, and try to only make one dish that I know they'll hate per night.  Since the nutritional value of broccoli >> mushrooms, they've fallen out of rotation, and off the menu all together. 

I'll have to make some next week.  All I need now is a good recipe."
">everything gets compared to American standards, that's not without a reason.

Maybe it does in America. 

>I'm not trying to be all ""Murica!!!""

but you're succeeding effortlessly"
"For me the Forbes ranking was not really relevant. First it uses very suspect data, like Payscale and Rate my professors.com etc, which I don't have any faith in. It also favors particular majors, doesn't take into account the fact that the coasts are more expensive to live in etc.
I feel that my outcome will be dependent on my major, where I choose to live, etc. Since I don't plan to major in Engineering which skews the salary data in a big way, I did not want to make my decision based on Forbes's output based ranking. I wanted to focus on input based measures for myself

I am sure for some the Forbes ranking makes more sense. For me it did not. I am focused on attending an academically good university. I don't want to judge that decision on ""what becomes of my peers, once they graduate"""
">That or my Marc Jacobs ""Oh! Lola"".

Hah, I'm wearing that right now. The solid version. It's ok, but feels so... mature."
Funny how KI and WoF are #1 in multiple other states but not their own.
"Bourbon. Sweet, sweet bourbon."
"funny because I always remembered it at number 7...

^(you saw NOTHING)

And, also to respond to your point, I don't actually think it's unfair. Brown is as or more selective than Penn and peers, offers a arguably better undergraduate experience, and I would say I always saw it as a T10. It's almost definitely a peer to Penn. 

For example, Brown beats Chicago in cross admits by a bit, and loses to Penn and Duke by a bit (i.e. <10% margin) so it's fair to say Brown can compete with this set for undergraduate."

"I see wrapping services in most airports. Its about 15 us dollars equivalent. Though i bet people could just use shrinkwrap and tape.

That said, a baggage handler here said wrapping is a bad idea as it inconveniences handlers and requires them to chuck baggage around to overcome the lack of moving wheels, poor friction etc."
"I would not try a manhattan for your 21st birthday. Just get some cocktails that are enjoyable and easy to drink so you don't have to force down some 12-15$ STRONG drink you don't enjoy. Margaritas, daiquiris, tom Collins, white russians, mai tai, hard cider, micheladas, beers are all enjoyable to drink."
"The best recommendations come from friends that have actually been somewhere good, and can tell you honestly that you'll have a great time.  

Tell us where you want to go and what your budget is, and perhaps your Reddit friends will help you out!"
"Pizza Online Company on Calle Real is absolutely fantastic.

Giovanni’s is good, too. Especially the location on the Mesa.

And Costco is actually pretty darn good."
My iPhone 6 is still getting security updates like 7 years after it was released. That would be the least of my concerns
