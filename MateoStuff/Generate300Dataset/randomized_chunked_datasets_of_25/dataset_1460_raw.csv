TD is one of those shows that puts me in a “mood” where I feel fully immersed. Another show that does that for me is Peaky Blinders
"The thing about RDR2 is you need to dedicate time to playing it.  So while I want to tell you this game should be next on your list, unless you can dedicate a couple of days within a weeks' time to it, it's not worth it.  The game play is so immersive and the controls are a little clunky that if you don't grind some quests and get into a little exploring while also getting the hang of the mechanics it can be frustrating to come back to.

That being said it's been my favorite game since GTA V and TLoU.  I think it took me personally 20 hours to go from somewhat enjoying the atmosphere and gameplay to falling in love with the game.  My observations on needing to dedicate the time are in regards to my friends who never seemed to like it.  They're also the ones who bounce around and play multiple games during their gaming sessions.  As you progress through the chapters I feel like gameplay develops and more mechanics open themselves up to you.  Even through 1/2 of the story you're still being taught new mechanics to make the gameplay better."
Sigh. He is seriously the best. Enjoy! No one makes me fangirl like Alexis Hall. He is also so kind to his fans. 😍😍😍

I prefer SFMM barely. Cedar Point is a very close 2nd but I really like X2 and Tatsu and I also feel like the bottom end of the lineup at SFMM is stronger. Steel Vengeance and Maverick are both fantastic rides but there was a dropoff after that for me. Carowinds and Six Flags Great America are both close as well. Those 4 parks all have great coaster lineups.
Sorry can’t be more helpful I don’t use Facebook but I noticed there was an option for using AdGuard filters within ublock origin so thought maybe you could try it out

"That movie was *very* flawed, and I see it get a lot of hate, but I love it so much.  That ending when [](/s ""you see that most of the characters are badasses and alive and the whole thing was planned to root out bad guys, and then Black Betty starts playing and the credits hit, just makes me wish there was a sequel called SECTION 8 all about the adventures of that team with Travolta, Jackson, Nielsen, Diggs, and the rest returning and Black Betty as the theme song."")"

What’s your opinion on the amazon solimo hand sanitizers?  Been using them for some time and I’m still alive and I think they’re good.
Ah so that’s the difference between them. Thanks!
"I don't think USB 3 Gen 2 (SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbit/s) can currently be longer than 1 meter... There's definitely no USB-IF Certified Cables longer than a single meter (3.3 feet). 

Although apparently the standard allows for up to 3 meters in theory using 26 pure copper strands, it just hasn't been developed yet... Some of the 2 meter cables you see online are actually using using the USB 2.0 standard and forgoing data capability to push more power, they wont be certified though (have the SS logo on the plug)."
Thanks for your input. Not to mention that the hien mid tends to slide on the desk as others have stated. Guess ill just have to see whats in stock. Fingers crossed that the hien comes in soft and red.
"well it is safe, but it blocks all that others feel like doing... taking all your data and sell it to others. Give it a try. You will like it."
Isn't this medical advice?
