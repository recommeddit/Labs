45909,best trick or treating candy,"I remember the house that gave these out when I was trick-or-treating as a kid, and that was a good 15 years ago. If I had the funds, I'd do this myself. But since we get too many kids for that to work, I will give out the Reese's instead. I figure that's still a good haul for the kiddies."
24036,best anime,I feel they approach the sci-fi genre in anime better than most. I find the best sci-fi the ones that don't focus on the the action. I find they cover some really interesting topics in the show and movie. Inspired the matrix so that's saying something :P

66071,best college in california,"If you can't spend a couple of hours to learn about or talk to a counselor about financial aid.. maybe ...  just maybe... the UC system isn't for you. The schools are beholden to different interests that give money to students for different reasons... don't blame the UC system, or the CSU system for that matter, blame the lack of interest most voters have in adequately funding higher education. Voters said no to the last ballot item about increasing funding for the three California systems of higher education."
63738,best books for time management reddit,"Constructive Living by David K. Reynolds. Also, if you want a great jumpstart on getting your ass in gear, I recently discovered Philosopher's Notes website and their video class Optimal Living. Huge, huge fan.

51800,best iphone case,"I really enjoyed this and you definitely saved tons of time and money for anyone reading your post!

Thanks to you, I'm going Rinke Fusion and splurging on an Apple Leather. I would've spent more than those two combined anyway over the life of my phone but now I have the clear option for stickers and the classy leather (which I would've pined over but dismissed as apple premium charge for mediocre quality)

Thanks again - you seem like a great techy and good human!"
50840,best rap album,SSLP over MMLP?
9709,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Ft is so far. Far from school, far from the beach. Don't under any circumstances apply for the scholar's floor. I got placed there randomly...boring. But other floors were really fun. I'm pretty sure Manzanita is the best though. That's where I hung out most besides ft, and it was so nice and had the best view. Plus it was right next to the beach, and I know a lot of people who liked Carillo Dining Commons best out of all the places to eat. Make that your first choice I think."
1285,best ice cream flavor,"They hate you for your confidence in saying it because secretly they like it too. REAL vanilla ice cream, as in you can see the specks of ground vanilla bean in it, tastes amazing. The cheap shit they can't legally call ice cream and is the color of glue, not so much."
42666,best detective show,Yes! I was checking to see if anyone else had mentioned this one. It's soooo good!!
