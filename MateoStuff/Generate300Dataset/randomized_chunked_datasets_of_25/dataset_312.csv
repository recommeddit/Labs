51125,"Apparently there were no worthwhile recordings prior to about 1950 either.  

I kinda think it would be more credible if they just stuck to rock.  They don't know shit about jazz.   Look at their 4 token instrumental jazz albums:

* 79 - Miles Davis - Kind of Blue 
* 188 - John Coltrane - A Love Supreme 
* 303 - Charles Mingus - Mingus Ah Um 
* 323 - Miles Davis - Bitches Brew

Such brave choices.  They include these 4, but no other instrumental jazz out of the other 496 albums.... yikes.

The Avengers - 8.1

Guardians of the Galaxy - 8.1

Iron Man - 7.9

Thor: Ragnarok - 7.9
