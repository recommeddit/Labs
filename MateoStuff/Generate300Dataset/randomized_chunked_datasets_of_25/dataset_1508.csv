24536,"1.Baccano. Extremly fun cast of characters, the achronological way the story is told makes you think.
2.Durarara. Longer than Baccano so it can have better character development, limited geographical area is both its biggest weakness and biggest strenght compared to Baccano
3. HunterxHunter. Shounen battle series done right. Complex. Nice themes. And the best antagonists in anime.
4.Steins;Gate. Time travel has always been my jam and this is doing it right. Not as good as the VN since thatâ€™s more emotional, but good enough
5.Mawaru Penguindrum. Emotions overflow, perfect balance between comedy and tragedy, Ikuhara is a mad genius",best anime

While documentation can be a little bit lacking sometimes on some little details, it's pretty neat, efficient, and extensible. I've had trouble downloading large files from my node app because on some connections there was a timeout, but with Got I was able to plug-in another http agent that supports keepalive.

Also, it's got progress support when you're dealing with large requests (downloading/uploading big files)",axios alternatives reddit

It should be mostly activated charcoal (carbon), and an ion exchange resin. You can buy both in bulk online and simply replace them in the filter housing. I was fortunate enough to find some on sale at Kroger when they were liquidating the Reuse brand products. Each pitcher was $4.99 and came with three filters.",best water filter
