36630,best alcoholic drink,"Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred."
264,best terminal file manager reddit,"* Config files are saved in your home folder so the program won't have access to your config files

* It's a massive security risk.


[***""As put by Emmanuele Bassi, a GNOME developer: ""there are no *real*, substantiated, technological reasons why anybody should run a GUI application as root. By running GUI applications as an admin user you are literally running millions of lines of code that have not been audited properly to run under elevated privileges; you are also running code that will touch files inside your $HOME and may change their ownership on the file system; connect, via IPC, to even more running code, etc. You are opening up a massive, gaping security hole [...].""***](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Running_GUI_applications_as_root)"
68789,best science fiction novel,"Dan Simmons also wrote *The Terror*, which isn't quite Sci-Fi but was just as good as Hyperion, IMO."
37216,best amusement park,"It may not be on Google trends, though. A lot of people refer to each SF park as just ""Six Flags"" rather than its full name, and if you shorten the search term to just that, the difference is stark.

I compared Discovery Kingdom to Knott's also, so I don't think it's enough to make up for the gap, and even in the LA area SF is leading."
12471,best gifts for mom,"I made her a calendar with collages of family pictures for every month. She cried while flipping through it. I did this as an after-thought/extra gift, and she has asked for one every year since."
57725,best cologne,"I really like Bottega Veneta, sort of a woody, peppery scent. Personally, I hate really sweet smells, and opt for more of a woody smelling cologne. Give it a try! About 100 bucks a bottle."
28381,best breakfast foods,"The name itself isn't very helpful. 
Basically it is a more close to the original grain. 
It is chewier than the standard fast cook rolled oats. 
I prefer the mouthfeel of steel cut, but there is about zero difference in nutritional value."
3182,best webcamera,"Does the Studio have the same autofocus issue? If the issue really is as prominent as you say, I'd like to return/resell the Cinema and buy a Studio instead."
16897,best iOS game,"Not OP, but I was reminiscing on Dungeon Raid and decided to do a reddit search on it. Thank you so much for troll Patrol! It doesn't feel as snappy but it scratches the itch!"
51965,best iphone case,I should have mine on Tuesday.  I had the MagEZ on my 12 Pro and loved it.

2792,best headphones,Neither are very good. I don't recommend either if you care about sound quality. But wireless in general is bad for quality .
13961,best research paper archive,"Do you have any justification? In my opinion conferences in CS are the same as elsewhere: more common, easily to get accepted, shorter papers, more specific topics, less impact overall."
63825,best books for building better habits reddit,"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, by Stephen Covey"
64170,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"You forgot https://snewd.com/ (but granted, it is very similar to the gutenberg project)"
53209,best hiphop album,"Listen again. I mean, it's a lot more soulful than other albums from the 90's, but it's got some of the best rhymes ever. Like listen to Lauryn's verse on [family Business] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZULHO8Z57Y)"
5173,best home improvement store,"HD website and search is better.  Sometimes I search for things I need online and note the aisle/bin numbers.  Lowe's search just doesn't seem to pick up things as well, like searching for a specific trowel size.

And my Lowe's doesn't have tool rentals."
