65310,best phone service company,"Stetson all I can say is WOW! This is awesome.

I decided to try US Mobile 5GB @$19.91 per month for 5 GB data with unlimited talk and text. Unless throttling becomes an issue (VZ infrastructure is in abundance all around me) this seems like a halfway decent ""set it and forget it"" minimal effort deal.

What u/mrpickem1 wired up on the AT&T Prepaid 8GB Annual is awesome and I may consider that if I need more than 5GB or performance is problematic. Also note: Best Buy currently offers a 10% store credit/discount on prepaid cards."
