35792,best alcoholic drink,"I haven't seen any helpful replies here, just expensive scotches with no context, so let me try to help. I've been drinking scotch for around 10 years now, so I can give you an amateurs angle.

First off, there are different 'types' or flavours of scotch that are named after the region of Scotland they are distilled in. The common ones that I see most often are: Islay, Speyside and Highlands. There's also Lowlands and I believe Island malts.

Islay malts have the most distinct flavour compared to others. They are known for being smokey and petey (some people say it's like drinking a campfire, my wife said it smelled like hotdogs). While everyone's palate is different, I very seldom have come across someone who like Islay malts when they started drinking scotch. It took me 7 years to start enjoying some peat in my whiskey. The best known Islay malt is Lavagulin 16 (the fave of Ron Swanson) but there are [7 other distillers in that region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay_whisky). If you want my advice, **don't** start with an Islay malt.

The most popular scotches in the world, Glenlivet and Glenfiddich (pronounce it fid-itch or fid-ick, either way someone will correct you) are both from the Speyside region. Speyside malts are a great place to start. If you drink beer, think of it like introducing someone to beer with a lager. Pretty classic stuff. These are a great starting point. Don't listen to elitists, you don't need your first scotch to be an $80-$100 scotch (I'm Canadian so in US dollars I think expensive is $50-$70. These scotches are sweet, a bit grassy, smooth and quite good. Pick one of those two that I mentioned. Start there and enjoy it. If you like it, move up $20 or so.

Once you like that, give the Balvenie Doublewood 12 Year Old a try. That's a Speyside with some awesome character. It's one of my standbys. 

Highland malts are awesome to try as well (my two faves are highland malts). Dalwhinnie 15 Year Old is an excellent malt, and my absolute favourite scotch: Oban 14 Year Old is a Highland malt as well. 

Bottom line, start small and ease into it. Try stuff slowly. If you can, try a sip out of someone else's bottle (most scotch drinkers are happy to pour a couple glasses and have a drink with a friend) before buying a whole bottle. 

Tl;Dr: Start with Glenfiddich or Glenlivet (12 year for either) then work up from there. This advice will fit 90% of new scotch drinkers. 

EDIT: lol It's Glenfiddich. My bad. Dunno where my brain was. I don't drink it often (I pick Glenlivet between the two)."

30621,best Mexican war to study,">No they didn't. WW1 was completely unjustified. The us complained about uboats, but ignored the much more extensive British blockade of Germany.

The difference was that the British weren't sinking American ships and killing their crews/passengers. The Germans were. Also, the US didn't ignore the British blockade--the US protested when the British seized American ships heading for Germany, and the UK relented. The Germans intentionally resumed unrestricted submarine warfare knowing that this would cause war with the USA.

>Mexico was in the middle of a civil war at the time and completely incapable of attacking the US. In fact, there was a US force in mexico at the time hunting down Pancho Villa.

Irrelevant. The point is that Germany *tried* to start another US/Mexican War. That alone is a casus belli."
