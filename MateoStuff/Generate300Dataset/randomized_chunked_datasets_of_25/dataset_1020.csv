38132,"Depends on what you want and how much time you want to spend!

For an abridged version of the main storyline, I would recommend:

Iron Man, The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame. And you could probably skip The Dark World and Doctor Strange if you wanted.

For just my personal recommends of the most fun/best of the series:

Iron Man, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man Three, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Infinity War.  Would include Endgame but the enjoyment of that really comes from watching most if not all of the series. 

David and Griffin are big fans (relative to most) of Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man Three, and Guardians Vol. 2, so those are just fun eps",best Marvel movie

4843,"Don't get me wrong, I like Lowe's, they have certain advantages over Home Depot. Their staff is around to help more than HD, and they have a lot more stylish fans and lamps than HD (in my own opinion)

Where I lean towards Home Depot is 2 things - credit and contractors.

Home Depot credit card (Citibank) seems to understand that if you're looking for a home improvement card you need a large credit limit. I've done some larger jobs with Home Depot that we're 15k+ and HD Citibank had no issue extending my credit line to 30k so my credit line doesn't look like I maxed the card out (and hoping I spend 30k ;)) 

Also, 24 months interest free is a good deal for large projects since I always pay it off before interest gets accrued.

Lowe's credit (Synchrony bank) maxed me out at 8k credit limit, and refused to extend even though my income and credit scores allowed for 30+k credit limits elsewhere. They do no interest or 5% off the order, but that means nothing if you can't do a large project on it.

Finally, there is contractors. I've only had flooring installed from both companies. HD assigned it to a specific contractor, which were amazing. Showed up on time every day, got the job done right, same crew every day. No bullshit.

Lowe's had 3 contractors show up at my house in the 3 days the job was going on, each not sharing what they did the previous day so I had to re-explain certain things about the job multiple times. Was not pleased with that at all.",best home improvement store

56384,"The black smear is very minimal and a non-issue in my opinion. 

Having said that, the retail price makes it not viable as an option in my opinion.

I got mine for 1 month old for $1200 over a year ago, and even though it's a great monitor, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over $1000.

My CX blows it out of the water in literally every way, other than the refresh rate. 

It has now been relegated to playing FPS and displaying my timeline in after effects.

Edit: Saw something about the [new G9](https://www.overclock3d.net/news/gpu_displays/samsung_s_next-gen_odyssey_g9_deliver_super-wide_5k_at_240hz_with_hdr2000/1) being 240hz, mini led with over 2k zones, HDR2000 certification. So if anything, that's likely to be the new holy grail until high refresh rate oled monitors hit the market.",best desktop monitor
