67953,best science fiction novel,"I came here to mention Canticle and Handmaid's Tale. I think the OP's list is a good ""sci-fi books you should read if you're into sci-fi,"" while yours is a great ""sci-fi books you should read if you're into books."""
11113,best backpack for college,"Heh, my parents had the credit card, so mine was bought with reward-points (free shipping and monogramming too)."
12367,best gifts for mom,"I'm in Cambodia right now, and I'm about to take a 1 hour flight instead of a 10 hour bus for $70"
36095,best alcoholic drink,"Are you kidding? Maybe it's just a Canadian thing but rye is the go-to whiskey for everyone I know, and absinthe is almost never turned away."
16631,best pet for toddlers,"Your cat needs more enrichment, otherwise it wouldn't be interested in escaping. The way you describe the poor thing running out describes a trapped animal under stress attempting to escape. If she does come back, try creating a more engaging environment for her. Lots of ledges, places to climb and play on, places to hide, different kinds of toys, and create a schedule for her,  consisting of feeding, playing, affection, and training. And make sure her litter box is clean, otherwise she'll escape to find a better place to do her business. If you can train her to walk on a harness, take her for walks. 


If she doesn't come back, I would suggest waiting a few years before getting another pet. At least until your daughter can more actively care for it and you can create a more positive environment for an animal. Cats and dogs were never meant to live in an apartment and even though we may live in them, we leave them every day. It's very challenging to create a good environment for animals when you keep them inside.


I suggest starting a window or balcony garden or getting a fish, but make sure to get an appropriate sized tank.  If she wants something cuddly, get her a furby or robo pet. She might like it better once she realizes she can take it anywhere and it won't run away."

46041,best trick or treating candy,"I guess they could, i think theres probably several ways to do it. You should try one, the cavities arent THAT bad"
27014,best board games,"Xia is a DLC as well, but it doesn't have the expansion that I've heard is essential to make it better."
37736,best Marvel movie,"Infinity war is the “best” but Endgame is my favorite.

31445,best country to live in,28! I make beer in my spare time!
2504,best headphones,"I'm sure it's different from person to person, but I've heard a lot of others complain about their comfort as well. The main issue was that they only covered about 95% of my ears, so a small part of my ear was getting pinched. With the slightly bigger pads that's not an issue."

17009,best iOS game,">[Starbase Orion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starbase-orion/id438375580) \- A remake of the classic Masters of Orion game. Fantastic, deep old-school space empire 4X. Highly recommended but be warned this game has a learning curve, but also a small yet dedicated online player base of veterans who are more than willing to help you learn.

This right here is a SUPER underappreciated gem. If you haven't played it and you're in the thread talking about Civ (or have any fond memories of Star Trek: Birth of the Federation) get this game."
