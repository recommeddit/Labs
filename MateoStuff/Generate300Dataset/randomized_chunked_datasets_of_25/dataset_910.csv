5685,"I think you can get freelance work for sure, but I also think ""digital nomad"" jobs can be full-time. There are a good number of startups who really need good front-end work that have no location requirements. 

I spent a very long time making a lot of money (over six figures USD) doing nothing but highly customized WordPress themes. The work was 90%+ HTML/CSS with light JS (mostly changing container classes to trigger CSS states) with the rest being the PHP to insert WP template tags. (You can hire this out very easily; I did that for the last few years even though I know how to do it myself.)

Don't fall into the trap of believing that there's a magical quantity of knowledge required to get freelance work. There's not. It just requires knowing a little bit more than a client and having the confidence to sell that. 

You'll pick up skills with experience. I recommend picking up as many as you can over time, because it keeps the job exciting. But no matter what you work on, HTML/CSS will come up. And JS will be close behind. 

Good luck!",best programming language for web development

Not enough to make it worth paying too much more, I have a 23 inch HP at 60hz and a same size 75hz Asus monitor, both at 1440p, I can't tell much of a difference if any between. Contrasting my 75hz monitor to my friends 144hz monitor shows the huge leap, I regret my choice for two and would happily go with one now and then another later.",best desktop monitor

22821,"Probably too late to jump in this conversation, but I filmed a documentary on clean water and sanitation in rural villages in India.  Matt Damon contacted my group (about 5 students on a low budget) and said he heard about what we were doing and that he'd be in India.  Ended up spending some time with him and his brother (and Gary White) and traveling from village to village.  People didn't know who the famous person was (they knew one of us was famous though) and would come up and great all of us with equal excitement.  The whole time Matt just chatted us up about what we wanted to do with our lives, basketball, issues related to our film, etc.  Seriously a great dude.  I have loads of respect for him.  He also gave us a killer interview and in one of the villages, the kids had prepared a song for him...he responded later in the day by singing a song for them.",best celebrity

It's probably still possible to block Reddit ads, so just give it some time I guess.",best Chrome extensions
