"[Been making this EDM playlist for a couple of years now.](https://open.spotify.com/user/bjnelson262/playlist/3VckqEptvJyixwHOxseXJu) 400+ songs, genres from across the board, multiple sources and adding to it all the time, if not daily. All of it is upbeat, moving stuff. Some aggressive, some just gets you going. Open to any suggestions, too, but I've been thinking of keeping this master playlist and building smaller playlists from this with randomly selected songs via an outside app because Spotify's shuffle feature sucks..."
I have had carrot cake ice cream that was fantastic
Sounds like a more fucked up version of a Four horsemen of the apocalypse.
"Don't know much about Black Holes, but this taught me everything I needed to know about Kalman Filters for my senior design project: https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python"
Robotics;Notes and no Steins;Gate? Thatâ€™s rare.
Yes itâ€™s very slim
"Ah, ok! I actually donâ€™t mind the repeat posts. Sometimes I will skip putting something on my list then see it again and reconsider. I especially donâ€™t mind when there is discussion, it helps â€˜sellâ€™ me on something. ðŸ˜Š"

"Pleasantly surprised, I love many of these songs.

Anyway, you're the hero reddit deserves, and we need you right now. A thousand thanks."
"They will ship wine, but not from consumer to consumer which is the point I think you're trying to make.  There are licensed retailers (wine.woot.com, etc) that do ship by UPS though."
"I must confess it took me a while to work out what the last line meant.  But yes, Chills."
Wym hot tamales are great!
Get the PS4 or a Nintendo Switch.
"Coffee, strawberry with fruit chunks, and chocolate ice cream with fudge bites all in the same bowl."
"Awesome list! Thanks for sharing. Since you seem to like roguelike, Iâ€™d like to add to it a favorite of mine: Imbroglio"

Frankfurt seemed quite a bit more aggressive than the U.S. pre-911.
"I've read a few series by Arthur C Clarke and in retrospect I disliked all of them. Just to be clear, I loved the concepts that he came up with. Really fascinating stuff. It's just that *it takes so friggin long for anything to happen*. The books feel like they're great concepts that have been stretched to the breaking point and then stuffed with filler material."
"Half the verses are jay zs. It's credited to ""The Throne"""
Cello or Piano
"huh? You don't want me to upgrade to 32"" but you also commented that you are waiting for a 32"" version of GN950?"
"i use the avawo folio case, and i like it a lot. for my last phone, i had a large protective case (like an otter box), but i could not fit it in my pocket. the avawo case is sleek, i'm able to prop up the phone with it, and with the wallet style of it, i have no problem putting it in my pocket."
"My degree is in physics and math, and I work in software now. If I could do it again I'd study computer science, no question!"
32gb ram and ryx video cards arent super expensive. Nothing wrong with those recommendations. Of course 16->32gb is just quality of life though.
"Least favorite.... has to be Kendall for me. She just always seems so uptight & full of herself, I can't stand the way she talks to other people & I really can't stand that she talked so much shit to Kylie only to turn around and get the same shit done. I also truly despise Caitlyn, she can get fucked. 

*side note- I always thought it was hilarious as Cait was transitioning, she told Kris this whole thing would make her (Cait) a ""better person"" LOL yeah, okay!"
