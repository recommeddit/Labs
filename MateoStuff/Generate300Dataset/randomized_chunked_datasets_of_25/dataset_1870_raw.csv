"I've never failed to have a good time with **Shadow Hunters**. In fact, the game is so good that I kept playing it with different friends who bought their own copies immediately afterwards. It's best with 6-8, it's pretty quick and light, there's some deduction and strategy, and best of all there are usually some hilarious card interactions, ""stand up dice roll"" moments and at least one surprising twist when someone reveals an unexpected identity. It's like a lighthearted Resistance. 7 Wonders is a good game for a similar number of people if they are serious enough gamers too handle the dry, cerebral, spreadsheet scoring type gameplay, but **Shadow Hunters** is a blast in comparison."
I don't get a lot of compliments but if I'm going out or to work I use 2 maybe 3 sprays max however I've had a lot of people ask me what I'm wearing when I've had Bee by Zoologist on.
Thanks for the update on the guide. Lots of work/effort from you and I know it’s appreciated greatly by us. Thanks again!

"On my rewatch, I actually liked the earlier films more than I remembered, and I think it's because they are made better because of connections to the later (and better) films. Especially Captain America First Avenger. I was *very* surprised at how well it fit in with Winter Soldier and Civil War when viewed in close proximity with them, even though it had a different director and was set in another era."

"Levels out on the technical side; if you switch to management, it's not much different from a nontechnical career path after. 

I won't, because I like technical and can FI on that path."

Burnt Crisper is a down syndrome comic but you will hardly be able to tell because you will be so focused on his weight and light-hearted racist comedy.

"Nice list, thanks. One mistake I noticed though is carbridge costs $9.99 not $4.99. Consider adding some words to the description to say you'd only buy carbridge over the free carplayenable if you needed ios 13 compatibility."
