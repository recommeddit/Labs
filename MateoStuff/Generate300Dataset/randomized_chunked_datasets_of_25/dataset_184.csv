66218,best soccer team in the world,Too many mad people. Most are indifferent about AC Milan.
70491,best major to study in college,Another con is the sheer amount of finance grads there are.
65250,best phone service company,"Heyo mashed potato! A couple of things I notice missing:

1) The Red Pocket $30/year plan for Sprint-network devices available through eBay only. 

2) Red Pocket automatic activation promo for Sprint devices on the 10GB plan - first month is $3 and you can change any time to a lower cost plan before your “almost free” month expires.

I was going to write a Reddit post blog-style about both, but maybe I’ll leave that to you for your site 😃

I have been testing different older Sprint devices (Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy SIII, HTC ONE M8, etc) with stock ROMs vs custom ROMs using RedPocket as the carrier."

56389,best desktop monitor,"OLED is superior in many ways to FALD (including mini-LED as far as I have seen) but it is susceptible to burn in. Aside from that, I agree the CX is a very good product and the price is fair compared to what mini-LED is commanding. Even with a high number of zones, FALD has noticeable blooming in some situations. It's a kludge compared to OLED. Hopefully there will be computer-oriented desktop OLED panels soon, 48"" is still pretty huge."

38262,best newspapers to read,"The comment I was responding to stated:

> Just because The Economist is willing to occasionally lampoon ""the jackass or the elephant"" does not mean they do not have a bias. They do a really great job of pretending their economic assumptions and precepts are not also political.


The evidence I presented was that consensus in economics is based on evidence, not politics. 

Do you take issue with using evidence?"

70043,best major to study in college,"You can always save, save, save and then have enough to live out the next 20 years of your life as a park ranger, depending on how you spend your money and what amenities you choose to live with/without."

49134,best gaming monitor,"I got a 27GL83A-B, which is nearly identical to the 27GL850 and I absolutely love it. My only regret is not getting two of them to replace my second monitor."
38516,best newspapers to read,"I get the NY Times everyday, thanks to my neighbor being a delivery guy (there are always a few left over that otherwise just get junked). I rarely read the thing, tho. I get most of my news online. They just pile up until I have a moment to pull out the special sections (Tuesday Science rocks!) and I read through them in the bathroom. 

The only paper I actually read through is our local freebie, the Mountain Xpress. It covers local politics, culture, happenings, opinions and other local interest stuff. The writing's good and it's all stuff that's actually relevant to me on a day-to-day basis. It gets read cover to cover. Other than that, not so much."
35461,best alcoholic drink,Amaretto and Sprite tastes like cream soda. Amaretto is usually like 28% but if you’re throwing them back like regular sodas it’ll get you there pretty quickly.
