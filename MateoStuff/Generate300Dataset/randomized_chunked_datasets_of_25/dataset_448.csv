5204,"I find Lowes to be cleaner, brighter, less crowded, and more employees to get help with stuff vs Home Depot which is dark, dingy, dusty, crowded, and every employee is busy so it's hard to get help. Home Depot does have cheaper prices and a way better tool selection, but Lowes seems to have nicer items. Both are within a 3-5 minute drive for me so I pretty much choose what I want from both. I prefer Lowes, but when I need a tool now then it's off to Home Depot. I've used the HD rental tool a couple times as well. Also, I've been harassed by those stupid solicitors at Home Depot (no I don't need my water tested, been drinking the same unfiltered twp water for over three decades).

Overall it's Lowes for me, but HD wins in tools.",best home improvement store
