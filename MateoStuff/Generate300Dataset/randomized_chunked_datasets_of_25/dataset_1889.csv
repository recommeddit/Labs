23359,best car racing video game,"> Dirt 4 and 5 - Cannot tune vehicles either.

You sure? I tried giving Dirt 4 a go a couple of weeks back and there seemed to a pretty intricate set of tuning options. Pretty much identical to what I saw in Horizon 3."

65894,best college in california,"An MBA at USC will cost you about $180k, but the social connections and job opportunity is unmatched. You are going to find employment paying over $120k but likely to be closer to $200k.
The UC and CSU systems are very different but depending on your needs, you may just need CSU. I.e. if you're going to work in HR for a state sponsored institution, the CSU will suffice and you will make over $110k."
64671,Best Nike running shoes,I tried on a pair on Gel Nimbus because they were almost twice the price of a normal pair.  They were way more cushiony than the other pair of Asics that I tried.  My girlfriend ender up getting the same pair. She says she feels much better after work now.
21193,best workout music,Rob Bailey and The Hustle Standard gets me pumped every time :D
21833,best winnie the pooh comic,The fourth panel is the kicker here
54612,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"How much slower is the zero than the Hien? I swear my Hien has slowed down loads to the point where I think would be like a zero cause the initial static friction isn’t non existent now and it definitely feels slower, like pretty much same speed as my Dechanic control now. I’ve washed the Hien as well and it still not the same as when I got it"
59209,best perfume,"I do Gucci Rush and J'Adore and definitely get compliments on both of those. I also wear Outremer Rose as an everyday thing, because it's pretty inexpensive, and I've gotten a few compliments on that as well. My favorite ever was Estee Lauder Dazzling Silver, but it was discontinued. I've been hanging on to the empty bottle for years so I can smell it every now and then."
66072,best college in california,I’m at a loss as to why it’s okay to make  Californians jump through extra hoops to get an education though a publicly funded entity.

7930,best laptop for general use,I was thinking about buying the new G14 with 3060 but apparently they are not bumping the refresh rate upto 144hz which was the problem with last years. Are there any other alternatives? Preferably 14inch gaming laptop just like G14
10573,best suitcase lock,I work in international logistics. This does NOT apply for international flgihts as my companies prices are often 1/3 of an international plane ticket for a small parcel.
1125,best ice cream flavor,"There's a local ice cream shop near me that makes their own ice cream from scratch and my wallet and waistline have suffered. They have a standard list of daily flavors (chocolate, vanilla, mint chocolate chip, \[local coffee shop\] coffee, etc.), a list of ""daily"" (seasonal) flavors (they've have snickerdoodle (with chunks of snickerdoodle cookie in it!), almond poppy seed, huckleberry, peanut butter and jelly, lavender, and earl gray), and sorbets as well. Usually coconut or fruit flavored, but I don't go for that. Their snickerdoodle and earl gray are fucking amazing. I'm pretty sure they steeped the milk/cream in earl gray leaves before making the ice cream, because there weren't leaves in the scoop I had and I didn't see any in the tub. Their chocolate brownie was pretty bomb too. I think my favorite would be the earl gray though. It was so mild and unassuming, but still rich and delicious. 

Side note, lavender should not be an ice cream flavor. It tasted like eating perfume :("
22279,best celebrity,"I waited on Keanu Reeves at a coffee shop a bunch of times and he was super cool and a whale of a tipper.

I've also seen Terry O'quinn (John Locke from Lost) all over Baltimore. He is super nice to fans and even let me jump in front of him in line at borders once."

69642,best major to study in college,"It's such a shame that this is the reality, because if I could have majored in anything without worrying about money it would have definitely been Art History. I managed to get a few classes in while I was in college and they were definitely my favorite."
