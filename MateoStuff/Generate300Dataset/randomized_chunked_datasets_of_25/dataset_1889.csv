The UC and CSU systems are very different but depending on your needs, you may just need CSU. I.e. if you're going to work in HR for a state sponsored institution, the CSU will suffice and you will make over $110k.",best college in california

I swear my Hien has slowed down loads to the point where I think would be like a zero cause the initial static friction isn’t non existent now and it definitely feels slower, like pretty much same speed as my Dechanic control now.

1125,"There's a local ice cream shop near me that makes their own ice cream from scratch and my wallet and waistline have suffered. They have a standard list of daily flavors (chocolate, vanilla, mint chocolate chip, \[local coffee shop\] coffee, etc.), a list of ""daily"" (seasonal) flavors (they've have snickerdoodle (with chunks of snickerdoodle cookie in it!), almond poppy seed, huckleberry, peanut butter and jelly, lavender, and earl gray), and sorbets as well. Usually coconut or fruit flavored, but I don't go for that. Their snickerdoodle and earl gray are fucking amazing. I'm pretty sure they steeped the milk/cream in earl gray leaves before making the ice cream, because there weren't leaves in the scoop I had and I didn't see any in the tub. Their chocolate brownie was pretty bomb too. I think my favorite would be the earl gray though. It was so mild and unassuming, but still rich and delicious. 

Side note, lavender should not be an ice cream flavor. It tasted like eating perfume :(",best ice cream flavor
