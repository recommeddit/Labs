"MAny good suggestions here. But I think Raiders is thr definitive adventure movie. 

Surprised to see no love for Pirates 1. It has to be in the top 10 adventure movies ever."
"It's varies by store. Some have good people, good managers, etc. Some don't. One isn't better than the other across the board. Try out each and decide for yourself which of your local stores you want to shop at."
I am from southern California and I can confirm that any restaurant ending in -berto will be delicious.
And it has the best hat joke *ever*
Avi pass?

"Bi-rite in SF makes some of my favorite commercial ice cream.

Also Blue Bunny in Texas (which is exported to other places) has the best commercial strawberry ice cream I've ever had.

But I like my own best, preferably made with LN2.  Although a friend's goat cheese with fig jam was good. (Better after I added balsamic vinegar to it.)

Bananas Foster yogurt, with burnt sugar and quite rummy boozy thanks to the LN2 hit...

Blueberry lemon yogurt.

Coconut milk with palm sugar.

Sweet cream with blackberries and macadamias (a favorite at ColdStone when they have the components)

Rose petal jam in plain yogurt.

Honey with white sesame brittle.

Forbidden rice and banana."
"**ACQUA DI GIÒ PROFUMO** by Giorgio Armani. It is very versatile, thus usable in every season and during every occasion. And my female acquaintances love it. The scent is very fresh, harsh, and manly.

&#x200B;

**STRONGER WITH YOU** by Emporio Armani. This is an amazing ""cuddle-cologne"". Though it is not as versatile in terms of all year round, yet a fabulous scent during the fall and winter. But during these seasons you can wear it pretty much during every occasion, especially the one I listed above. The scent itself is very sweet and soft."
"Funny. My experience of the Netherlands is that it's VERY expensive, the locals are rude, they will NEVER give a good job to a foreigner (or at least never pay equally), the women are mostly ballbreakers, and there is racism coming out the yazoo. Oh, and my biggest peeve of all, fucking scooters in the bike paths... Avoid."
Fallet is weird but good. I'm halfway through Undercover and it has been enjoyable. Bordertown is another you may want to try. Bron/Bridge was the best.
"Like both lists, not many OL."
What is it about the premise of this movie that you like? I need a good hook
"I like things I see in this sub, but this shit right here...I REALLY like."
You sure there’s no nougat?
"In general, it's a good idea to pick no more than 5 colors for the entire house. If you do each different room a different color, it can feel overwhelming. It's also a good idea to choose either a ""warm"" or a ""cool"" color scheme. Paint specialists are your friends. It's worth spending the time going in to talk to someone at like a Benjamin Moore or somewhere similar because you don't know what you don't know! They can also probably help with the smell question - there might be a formula that helps?"
"Hmmm. All Scrappy, sneakily athletic white wide receivers?"
"I think it's more grown up because OSC had grown as an author. But I agree, Speaker for the Dead really does have a better sci-fi feel to it. Big ideas, big crazy ways to show them."
"That's a real nice piece of equipment.

In my opinion, all these cable reviews are missing very important characteristics, which you could get with a cable tester like in your lab.

It's like if you are on the market for a car. Plenty of articles that will describe the possible colors, the seats of the car, etc. Which is nice, but describing a car ought to include whether it's reliable, what maintenance costs are, the hard stuff."
I love my Arnettes.
"Careful. My dad was like yours, then my sister taught him to text. Now if you call him, he'll ignore your call and text you ""what"" like 3 days later."
"Retrosuperfuture has quite a few fits that sit well on Asian noses too.

In addition to an Asian nose, I have a big ass dome, so despite really liking the style, dainty little Ray Ban Wayfarers don't fit me well at all. I got a pair of Supers in their classic style and it's large enough, and sits on the nose."
...you majored in burger flipping. Sorry dude.
"Here is a tweet/graphic with a list of them:

I came here to say this but saw that you already said it exactly the way I would've... So... take your upvote instead...
Yep considering the premium currency I’ve bought I haven’t spent and did just to support the game
