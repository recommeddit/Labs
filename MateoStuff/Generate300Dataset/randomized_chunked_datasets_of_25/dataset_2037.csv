65644,best phone service company,"$250 is not bad.  Here is the deal I got in on, guess it was 2017.   
https://slickdeals.net/f/10765331-xfinity-mobile-500-visa-card-per-new-accout-200-visa-card-per-samsung-phone-line-activated#commentsBox
Needed a new phone so the $500 about covered what I wanted.  The extra $200 for a Samsung ($700 go total) was pretty tempting, but I was in too deep with Apple to switch hardware. No problem unlocking once it was all paid off either. 

Fingers are crossed for a similar deal from Spectrum or Comcast soon!"
55805,best action and adventure movie,"Unpopular opinion, but I prefer the mummy movies over Indiana Jones movies. Maybe because I grew up watching the mummy series."
73468,best battery bank,My tiny [anker 10000 mAh battery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PXMF52C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) charges my iphone 2-3 times.  That's enough for 3-6 days of phone use between outlets.   Which is huge overkill.
49365,best gaming monitor,It's a damn good monitor. I swapped it out because of a dead pixel that was in the center of the screen. Plus I was still within the return period. Only got the Dell because it had more features and was 70 bucks less
26782,best board games,"I really, really like Betrayal at the House on Haunted Hill and the Game of Thrones game, but both can be very lengthy and convoluted. 

Guillotine is probably my favorite simple game, as it is competitive but not ""I hate you"" inducing and it has a fun art style and concept."
46095,best trick or treating candy,"You sir, were raised right."
40493,best midrange GPU,"I didnt say Broke ass people cant game on PC, at all, not once

Go read what I said again.

Ive said this like 6 times now, what is so difficult to understand!

I said Broke ass people shouldnt PC GAME if their main motif is to complaining about the price of equipment they cannot make and they cannot make the means to an end, I.e get the money, get the extra hours, extra job, whatever they need to  to figure out how to buy something.

Even in the midst of a economic downturn affecting the markets.

The problem is PC gamers don't have priorities 70% of the time, its just to mindlessly game, and mindlessly attain the next best product, theyre never content and by far the most entitled group of people you will ever meet.

Oh and theyre all broke by doing what i just said, but having no savings afterwards.

They get just enough to buy everything to have nothing in their bank account.

My WHOLE point is priorities. If the last of your money would go to pc gaming but you figure that will hold you through going to work, coming home, and saving the losses made on buying pc rig's.

It's just like stop, stop stop stop stop stop stop stop.

Go find hobby while you can save money and be financially secure, and THEN have surprlus money to buy a graphics card or a whatever.

who says you have to pc game, who says you have to game at all, who says you cant just go enjoy nature trails, or growing food, or a garden, or go travel, or go cycle. People go do all those things and arent spending their last 15$ on it, theyre people of utility and sound ideas because its them that made their financial decisions a priority and not their pleasures.

Nobody cares if you dont have enough money for something, nobody cares how much the price of something rises, everybodies dealing with it.

Just so someone can play Red Dead 2 maxed out in 4k doesnt mean shit to anyone who's actually saved a dime.

People just look down at folks like that and it is what it is, try and change it and youre just gonna run into yourself.

If theres a problem fix it, if you cant stop complaining"

28868,best breakfast foods,"It's just a different routine and people don't like change... takes some getting used to. The liver stores enough glycogen for about 12 hours before shifting to fat-burning. Coffee with sugar or a glass of milk is all that's really necessary in the morning to replenish glycogen stores and keep metabolism from going wonky until dinner.
 
Edit: Wow, people really didn't like this comment. That's really weird. I mean if I'm wrong on how the liver's glycogen storage mechanism works, nobody's taken the time to correct me. My understanding is the a one-meal-a-day routine is perfectly healthy in the absence of conditions like diabetes or kidney failure. That's generally how I do things just out of habit... I usually just eat dinner and have maybe a muffin or a smoothie during the day, if anything. Keeps me from feeling like I need a nap after lunch if I just don't have lunch."
