51327,best iphone case,I‚Äôve been using that particular Spigen since my 6S Plus! It was bulletproof on my XS Max still looked good after almost 3 years I just got bored and went with a cheap hot pink number last winter to avoid new phone envy.
29952,best money managing app,"I used to use Mint and really liked it. I connected my bank and it was super easy to assign charges to categories. I only stopped because my husband is an accountant and prefers to budget using our own Excel file. Excel is nice because we can customize it ourselves, but I'm not great with Excel so if I wasn't married I'd probably still use Mint. I also like to listen to Dave Ramesy, and his company's budget app is called Every Dollar. A lot of people like that one too!"

31968,best hotel to live in,"I like Hilton, the perks I get for being Gold are pretty nice (free breakfast and/or bonus points depending on the brand, free upgrades, free internet) and there are Hiltons all over the place. Plus they have an app where you can check in ahead of time and choose your room and whatever amenities you'd like to have waiting in your room when you get there. And the points-plus-$$ options are great. 

We stayed at a resort in Scotland a few weeks ago, that I originally booked for 20k points, but then decided to go with the 8k points plus approx. $45 to save the extra 12k points for a later date. Between the free upgrade, breakfast, internet, and the kids eat free (dinner and breakfast), we ended up saving around $400 over what we would have paid for it all. For one frickin night. That was definitely worth the 8k points and $45."
59298,best perfume,"I'm a 27-year-old woman who knows absolutely nothing about scented perfumes (or ""parfum"", as the French bottles say), as my mother never bothered to teach me, and I used to work at Macy's. I get perfumes as gifts sometimes, but I have no idea what to do with perfume in general, or how to use it. This thread is helping a lot!"

66106,best college in california,"I don't know how I missed that one. 

There are roughly 3,000 students there, so I think that would be a good college for a reddit to cover issues of concern for students, faculty, alumni and prospective students. 

Keep in mind you can be subscribed up to 50 reddits (actually, you can be subscribed to many more than that, but reddit only displays 50 reddits at a time randomly selected from the ones that you are subscribed to).

Would you be interested in being a moderator?"
65726,best college in california,"California has some of the best, most prestigious, and best of all perhaps the most diverse assortment of colleges in the world. Whether you are a star S-tier student, or a struggling one that is finding their balance in college, there is every type of school for you.

Anybody in this sub would be glad to help, but I question why you ask this.

If you are going to be a college student, there is some responsibility to fall on yourself to make the preliminary research into your school options. I assume that the reason that you have been downvoted is because it is clear to most readers that you have not put any effort into any preliminary research at all.

It takes not even 20 seconds to look up ""best CA colleges"", and stumble upon a list like [this.](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/ca) It's okay to ask for help when you need it, but this is the most basic of research that takes a solid couple minutes of reading to do. You should do some basic research yourself, and then come back with some more substantial questions.

You should do your due diligence and put the effort into it, because if you can't even do this part for yourself, you will fail at any college that you enter."
66141,best soccer team in the world,"It's a common question on /r/soccer 

The answers seem to be split between AC Milan 1988-94 who got to five European Cup/Champions League finals in seven seasons (winning three) and took the Italian league title five times in that spell (88-96 to be precise) too. They were the last team to retain the title of European club champions. 


Barcelona 2009-2012 are up there.  I guess the jury are still out on what their ""era"" will be, in years to come it may extend to the teams which Xavi, Iniesta and Messi were the heartbeat of.  They won the Champions League in 2006 with a lot of the players who won it in 2009 and they might win it again in the next year or two, but the Pep Guardiola team were **so** good that they even stand out from the guys who bookended it. 

As an Englishman I'm compelled to add the great Liverpool team of the mid seventies through to the mid/late eighties.  They won four European cups (Champions League these days) two UEFA cups, three FA cups and ten league titles.  It was utter dominance and really the reason why Liverpool are still considered to be one of **the** great football clubs of our time. 

I guess you could argue for Real Madrid of the late 50s and the Ajax and Bayern Munich sides of the early to mid 1970s. I have to confess ignorance on those teams, before my time and on the other side of Europe from where I live.   I can't comment on the great South American teams but their club sides always seem to lose their best players to Europe, the very best teams to come from South America always seem to be national sides."

65266,best phone service company,"Thanks! Something I noticed; shouldn't visible party pay always be $25 per person no matter how many lines? Because you can join random people's parties? Or have a separate row for example:

1 line + 3 randoms = $25 per person

2 lines + 2 randoms = $25 per person
