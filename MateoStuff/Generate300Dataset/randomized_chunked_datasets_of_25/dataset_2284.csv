Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up, but, I’m happy I could help everyone here! This is the one I bought [Here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0888LQBDR?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for anyone who is wondering.

Edit 2: Sorry everyone, I was working. I’ll reply to everyone ASAP!

Edit 3: There are so many different ones that work just as well as the one I bought. Look into the attachments and reviews by people, on Amazon. It is super helpful!

69216,"I studied chemistry, as there wasn't a good CS program available (at the time, and in my country). I never planned on working in that field and never did. School taught me how to study. But it didn't teach me any of the subjects I really needed. That's all on my own time. In many ways, I feel I succeeded despite and not because of my schools best efforts.

In hindsight, the obvious choice would have been either to study abroad where there were good CS programs, or to go to a school that allows you to ""build your own major"". That's what my brother did a few years later, and he is quite happy with how that worked out.

Having said that, the outcome probably would have been similar in either case. It's just that the alternatives might have been easier than what I did. But then, being easier isn't necessarily better when making important life decisions and learning important skills (both soft and hard skills).

Pretty much the only thing that mattered for me was picking a STEM major. And my career after school definitely proved that in the end I made absolutely the right choices.",best major to study in college
15158,"Hackberry: not a glamorous tree but hardy, large, and native. Walnut or butternut very pretty but attracts squirrels. Catalpa very very attractive, but  a bit messy.

Medium sized Birch is very beautiful and native. Ironwood is not so beautiful but small. Honey locust very beautiful. Buckeye. Kentucky coffee tree.

Small trees (because trees are challenging): Mountain ash. Pagoda dogwood: mine is 30 feet tall, very beautiful aspect. Hop hornbeam. Wahoo, more of a 20 to 30 foot tall copse.

All these are native to MN. Plant native trees, they provide a huge amount of habitat and year-round interesting animals.

adding: Oaks! large and messy but wonderful. Crabapple, small to medium and can be messy but beautiful flowers. Willow is beautiful but very challenging. Magnolia or azalea: extreme beauty, but challenging in MN climate. Note, plant trees at least 25 feet from house. adding Linden (dur! can't believe I forgot!) They are beautiful, medium to large, they can rain aphid honeydew but only sometimes.",best tree for the garden
