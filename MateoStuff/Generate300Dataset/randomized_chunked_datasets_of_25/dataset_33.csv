22096,best celebrity,Neil gaiman. During a signing event I had a darker book. He held up the line and looked for a silver pen so he could sign the book and just chatted to me while he hunted through this kids pencil case he had.
46030,best trick or treating candy,"I think he means that he's doesn't want to have stuff left over that he won't eat. So he just buys stuff that he would eat, himself."
62448,Best RPG game on PS4,"You should give Witcher 3 another shot, great game

Diablo 3 is a must play dude. Get it. NOW!

Each final fantasy game is its own story. They are not connected at all. So yes you can just buy FF15 and play it. Highly recommended."
73532,best battery bank,"Anker makes great stuff and they stand by it. I had a multi-USB charger that one of the ports died on, and they sent me a new one, no questions asked."
8033,best laptop for general use,"Ah, I see. Then, I think that paying more for a gaming laptop the Zephyrus G15 is not a good choice for you. 

Since build quality is a big concern, a business grade laptop is down your alley. The new [**HP Probook x360 435 G7**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45suggestalaptop1&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-probook-x360-435-g7-notebook-pc-p-17g37ut-aba-1) is a good choice. It has a 6-core Ryzen 5 4500U, 16 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 13.3"" IPS touch 1,000 nit display. This model has the Sure View display, which is a privacy filter. That unfortunately limits viewing angles to an extent, but the display brightness is excellent."
19432,best YouTube video,"I love RTGame; helped me get through some dark, lonely times. He’s such a great guy who’s also absolutely hilarious!"
66261,best soccer team in the world,"But Chelsea have won the CL? Villa haven't won more than them. A more appropriate comparison would be you saying Villa should be ahead of Man City, which would be pretty much correct, Aston Villa are the bigger club"

47454,best state to visit in the United States,Come visit my home! It’s awesome
58523,best cologne,"I will speak for my twin sister on this one, as she tends to want to be in charge of my fashion choices. D&G The One cologne, Old Spice deodorant, and Irish Spring soap is one hell of a triumvirate.  

But apparently I'll have to buy Acqua Di Gio."
34269,best NFL player,Oh nice. Yeah CBS is ass and Khalil Mack is the real deal.

40882,best instrument to play,Try the Skin Flute.
31938,best hotel to live in,"Better elite status recognition, breakfast (actual breakfast not continental breakfast), upgraded suites etc. Often with fewer hurdles to go through than Marriott.  I think Marriott Platinum is something like 75 nights a year whereas starwood platinum is 25 stays or 50 nights.  Amex Platinum gives you Starwood Gold status for having the card.

Starwood lifetime gold status is 250 nights total (including award stays) and 5 years of having gold status (which you can get from the amex card or 30k spend per year), so it's easily attainable from any business traveler whereas Platinum is 500 nights."
67986,best science fiction novel,"Thanks for pointing out the oddness of having JDE and Redshirts on the list. 

Scalzi is one of my favorite authors, but Redshirts isn't ""The Forever War"" or ""Dune."""
