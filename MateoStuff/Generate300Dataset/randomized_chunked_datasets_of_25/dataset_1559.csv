30442,best Mexican war to study,Ben Franklin did really [love the ladies](http://www.wanderings.net/notebook/Main/BenjaminFranklinAdviceOnChoiceOfAMistress)
61039,Best comedy show on Netflix,I wish they'd hurry up and get moving on the last season.
21813,best winnie the pooh comic,I. Hate. This.
56154,best action and adventure movie,"*King Kong* (2005). No other movie has the level of anxiety inducing tension and non-stop peril like this one. 

Jackson stacked four major action scenes one after the other. Each one more risky and treacherous than the one before it, a real chore to sit through."
51916,best iphone case,"The  documentation states “quality leather”. That being said, it must be thin to produce such a thin case. I wouldn’t expect the same quality as a baseball mitt. I personally haven’t experienced any obvious defects, although in the past I have seen some peeling after a significant amount of wear. It wasn’t so obvious on the black cases I have previously owned."
57815,best cologne,Polo Ralph Lauren Blue
48096,best color to paint with,"What? No, this is wrong. Blue definitely does not suppress melatonin, it can actually help increase it, unless it's unusually bright and harash and even then it's effect on your melatonin is negligible, especially considering most people turn out the lights when they go to sleep."
26286,best politician,"Great list!

I'd add

35857,best alcoholic drink,I usually just drink cider because I do not enjoy the taste of alcohol. Maybe it is an acquired taste.
11000,best backpack for college,"I'll back this up, the suede bottom tore on mine in ~6 months of me buying it. Not too pissed since I bought it for $25, but so much for quality..."
4587,best text editor,"It seems that I might be among the  last of the joe users, but it is the only editor I use in shell.

For the actual development I use jetbrains IDE.  I am used to phpstorm, so pycharm might not be the best IDE for python (or it may be), but the UI is the same as phpstorm so switching between is really easy (it is a bit of memory hog (java), but these days that is not even close to being an issue."
11510,best gifts for dad,Hugs
5001,best home improvement store,"Also, Home Depot > Lowe's for tools. With a few rare exceptions. But Lowe's > Home Depot for outdoor furniture."
8209,best toothpaste,ITT: My parent is a dentist...
62905,Best Data Science textbook,"I'm still reading ""Clean code"", but read already ""Clean Coder"". The latter is ""softer"" (easier to read) than the former, since it has to do with the soft skills of a programmer and how he interacts with other people. The Clean code on the other hand takes more effort to read and understand, because it describes best practices of coding along with lists of Java code which you're expected to study. For this reason reading and digesting the ""Clean code"" takes more time.

If you'd like to buy one of the two, I'd suggest you to get the ""Clean code"" and perhaps borrow the ""Clean coder"" from a friend."
31854,best hotel to live in,"I've stayed at Cabana Bay, Royal Pacific, and Portofino Bay. If you don't mind spending the extra money, I loved Portofino. It is a stunning hotel, and we loved the pool there as well. My second favorite was Royal Pacific, the theme is so well done."
64650,Best Nike running shoes,Asics gel orthotec 5
9744,best dorm hall at UCSB,Oh damn thought it was segregated
47625,best state to visit in the United States,I'd also add on the San Juan Islands.
32693,best vacation resort,"The all inclusive ""American Plan"" is a very rare animal theses days for luxury hotels.  Let your FIL frustrate himself searching for a beach resort that will provide it.   Otherwise FIL should considered renting a staffed house on the beach.  Can be pricey."
54440,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Zero stops a tad better. About 10/10 stops on zero and 9/10 on otsu v2. For me, the otsu is plenty of stopping, but that's cause I'm now used to Raiden and shidenkai speeds and low stopping forces."
24136,best anime,"1)Bakemonogatari
2) Cowboy Bebop
3) Trigun
4) Elfin Lied
5) Baccano!
6) Space Dandy"
67400,axios alternatives reddit,"[superagent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent) is a pretty solid HTTP client. Not the most popular but it does have a large user base and is still maintained. 

Axios seems to be one of the most popular clients but the lack of updates in the past year and the growing backlog of issues reported on github makes me hesitate to use it in new projects or recommend it to anyone."
1959,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,The wife and I love Olio Pizzeria. Does it count if it’s brick oven?
17883,best Kardashian,You’re doing the lords work.
