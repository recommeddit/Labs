51916,"The  documentation states “quality leather”. That being said, it must be thin to produce such a thin case. I wouldn’t expect the same quality as a baseball mitt. I personally haven’t experienced any obvious defects, although in the past I have seen some peeling after a significant amount of wear. It wasn’t so obvious on the black cases I have previously owned.",best iphone case

62905,"I'm still reading ""Clean code"", but read already ""Clean Coder"". The latter is ""softer"" (easier to read) than the former, since it has to do with the soft skills of a programmer and how he interacts with other people. The Clean code on the other hand takes more effort to read and understand, because it describes best practices of coding along with lists of Java code which you're expected to study. For this reason reading and digesting the ""Clean code"" takes more time.

If you'd like to buy one of the two, I'd suggest you to get the ""Clean code"" and perhaps borrow the ""Clean coder"" from a friend.",Best Data Science textbook
