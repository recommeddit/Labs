8659,best toothpaste,"Dentist - as long as it has 1450ppm Fluoride in it (check the back of the label) I don’t care. I buy the cheapest I can. 

If you want desensitising toothpaste the most important thing is fluoride, and after that - different brands have different additives but most work on the same principle. 

Whitening toothpaste either abrades your teeth to get rid of surface stains or has a “blueing” agent to counteract the yellowing on your teeth

Some gingival health toothpastes have chlorhexidine added. 

But if you just have normal human teeth without a specific problem - just get own brand.

Edit: there are also prescription only toothpastes with high fluoride content that your dentist can prescribe. But if you don’t need these (ie if your teeth aren’t in a state of disrepair) then they won’t benefit you

Edit (x2) do not brush your teeth with baking soda or similar products. You’re never going to grow back that enamel you’ve sandpapered off every morning and night!"

54397,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"As people said it's mainly the shipping cost that killed it.  Otherwise the mousepad itself is nice but it's not going to be a night and day difference, I'd say it's probably a solid 15% better than your regular mousepad.

That being said, I originally bought Shiden, Hien, and Hayate medium size.  But I realize I never use that big of an area and really don't need that big of a mouse pad, so I switched to Goliathus Mobile Stealth (laptop mousepad) instead.  And at any point I never thought to myself man I miss the Artisan mouse pads.

So my advise is that if you can afford it, I'd say buy one to try it so you've seen the top end of the mouse pad spectrum (more like a life experience thing).  But if not, then it's also perfectly fine to use something generic like Razer Goliathus (like me).  Either case don't sweat over it lol."

69691,best major to study in college,"I double majored in criminal justice and philosophy. I wanted to go to law school, so I figured CJ would be good for that, and I thought philosophy was fun. 

Turns out CJ was pointless for law school, and philosophy turned out to be great for preparing for it. The majority of the LSAT is straight up logic. Guess what you learn in philosophy? Logic."

61757,Best RPG game on PS4,"> RPG = Role-Playing Game (usually heavily invested in some form of stat system).

Role playing =/= stats. Does Dark Souls allow you to RP a hard line, lawful good character? Or a selfish warrior? Or approach you with ethical questions? Or provide multiple approaches to addressing quests? Or a variety of dialog options? AFAIK, none of the Dark Souls games do. Story telling, characters, and dialog are usually not brought up when discussing Dark Souls' strengths . . . which usually begin and end with 'combat'."
