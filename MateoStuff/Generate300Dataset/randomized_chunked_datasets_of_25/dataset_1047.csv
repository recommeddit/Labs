I boil about 20 eggs at a time and bring one to work each day for breakfast. Importantly, I noticed that *when* I eat the egg makes a difference. If I eat it at 8, it seems to kick start my metabolism and I'm hungrier by lunch. If I wait a couple hours and eat at 10, it holds me over perfectly until lunch.",best breakfast foods

3280,"I had the same question when I saw the stream deck. I found the mini on sale for 60% off at Best Buy and figured I'd return it in a week. I absolutely can not imagine streaming without it now. It seriously upped my streaming game from the first day I had it. 

The main thing I use it for is super easy macros. The companion app lets you drag and drop actions so you can press one button and have it do countless things. I have buttons set up for camera zooms, sound effects, incoming and outgoing raids, muting and unmuting, switching scenes in interesting ways. I highly recommend picking one up.",best webcamera

Though in all seriousness I have a lamp from tau tronics and love it. Not a classic architect lamp exactly, but it is just as adjustable, you can change the light to be more warm or cool (the warm light is nice at night when winding down since it's not as harsh, the cool light is nice when I'm working on other projects at me desk), it's dimmable, and most importantly to me it doesn't look out of place at a computer. My version is built really well too, nothing feels flimsy or cheap. The exact version I have seems to no longer be on Amazon, but I'm pretty sure this the successor to it:
