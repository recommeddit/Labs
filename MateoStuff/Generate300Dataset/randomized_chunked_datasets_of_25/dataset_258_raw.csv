"MSI MAG251RX imo, there’s also the AW2521HF if if you don’t need backlight strobing. The Alienware comes on sale on dell.com/ca and you can use code 10%OFFMONITOR for 10% off too"
Dialogue delivery sucks.
In Pace / Milton — lived in ATL and LA prior and TMobile was awesome.  However I’d lose services for 5-10miles on I10 between Biloxi - Mobile - Pensacola so I went back to Verizon.  It’s more reliable but I’m underwhelmed by this areas service in general.   Even our FTTH in two locations underperforms.
"Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johansson regularly frequented the restaurant I work at for a bit, and they are both genuinely awesome people.  Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis were way too preoccupied when they came in to even acknowledge my presence of trying to wait on them."
Thank you. thank you. THANK YOU!
"It literally makes no difference, the differences between different switches are pretty negligible, the only really noticeable one being either that they’re quiet or clicky. Reds are quiet and blues are clicky.

Generally speaking, red switches are the most common for gaming as they are linear and are quiet."
"I think SFFT is very underated, it needs one show stopper coaster, and I think people would completely change there tune on it, I also think its the best themed six flags, and literally one of the top five amusement parks in terms of setting, having the rock wall to use in coaster layout is simply amazing."
Pho is also great for hangovers.

"I wish I had had a conversation like that with my mom. She died when I was 19, right when we were starting to get along better. I really miss her and wish we had gotten to talk more."
"I just wish that Linux played better with games.  I know, I know, it is improving but for quite a few games you have to be a power user just to get them running."
Idk I just like chocolate. And I never drank a milkshake
"Yes that’s the one!

I had a very positive experience, and I absolutely recommend the course. I was skeptical because it’s less recognized than General Assembly or some of the others. Also, there seems to be mixed perspectives as far as how valuable and worthwhile these courses are. You’ll see plenty of UX professionals on Reddit saying how they never hire people from these courses, etc. So naturally I was concerned, but took those statements with a grain of salt and pursued it anyways.

I think my experience was so positive because of my mentor. He was super communicative, encouraging, and empathetic, not to mention incredibly intelligent and successful. 

At the end of the course, I had completed an online portfolio and had gained the language to speak confidently about user experience design. Took me a couple months to land a job, but immediately landed a job after going through a staffing agency. 

Overall, completing the course through designlab truly set my life on the path I had wanted for so long. I’m now in an industry that challenges me, and every day I feel so fortunate to have had the fortitude to pursue what I wanted and to have actually landed a job. That being said, I am super passionate about understanding people on a very human level, problem solving, and working with others. I love giving people positive experiences, so the industry very much matches my personality. Definitely do your research before committing to one of these programs because once you commit, you really have to be prepared to work your ass off, even after the course ends. Interviews for these jobs are no joke. 

Can I ask, why do you wish to pursue one of these programs? What is driving you to want to enter this field?"

"Best: 100 Grand and Snickers

Worst: Peppermint Patties and the candies in the non-descript yellow and red wrappers."
"Don't get married to just one network, use a mediation layer instead."
Even so I'd say getting a malicious virus on android is probably far more common than CIA exploits on ios or osx.
