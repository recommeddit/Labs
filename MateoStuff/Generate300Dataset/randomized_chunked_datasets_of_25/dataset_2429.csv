16680,"I've got 3 guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are cute and cuddly and let you hold them. Thet rarely bite. They're friendly, make cute sounds, and generally look adorable. They're not suitable for a young child, though. They're extremely delicate I'd recommend them for a 5/6 year old at the youngest.

 But even at 5/6 she'll still need supervision. Squeezing them too hard or dropping them can result in broken limbs, paralysis,  or death. 

Furthermore they need unlimited hay 100% of the time. There are kinda that people are less allergic too, but it can still cause issues.

Third, they generally live 5-8 years and you'll need yearly check ups. You'll need to find a Cavy Savvy vet (someone who specializes in guinea pigs). This is usually an exotics vet. Each visit will likely cost around $100. They need this to keep tabs on their health, and the vet can check things you can't see, like their back teeth.

Fourth they need a cup of fresh veggies per day. Usually romaine or butter lettuce is good. Occasionally you have to give them bell peppers. It's high in Vitamin C, which you need to prevent scurvy. Too much calcium in their diet can cause bladder stones. Too much sugar can cause diabetes. An improper diet drastically shortens their lifespan.

You need two. They're extremely social. You'll need at least a 2x3 foot cage. Store bought cages are too small. 

If they ever escape, expect to never see them again. They're liable to get eaten, overheat, or freeze to death.

Also they poop a lot.

Guinea pigs are a lot of work, but for an older child, they could be a good pet as long as you do most of the work and supervise her while handling.",best pet for toddlers

10918,"I don't know who would really disagree with this. TNF backpacks are really well rated and great city packs, Just not the best for actual outdoors weight/space ratio. I love my recon, so this is my recommendation as well. The padding is all super comfy. Has a ton of space. Looks good. Definitely my favorite of the function based pricier options 

If you want something cheaper I'd just get a jansport. I've been ripping the label off of them since middle school and they're a great minimal canvas backpack.",best backpack for college
