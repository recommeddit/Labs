68438,best science fiction novel,It is head-and-shoulders above any of the other Halo books and handily beats the Warhammer 40k books as well (and those are generally a high bar for game adaptation novels). Nylund is a rare talent in that space.

16680,best pet for toddlers,"I've got 3 guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are cute and cuddly and let you hold them. Thet rarely bite. They're friendly, make cute sounds, and generally look adorable. They're not suitable for a young child, though. They're extremely delicate I'd recommend them for a 5/6 year old at the youngest.

 But even at 5/6 she'll still need supervision. Squeezing them too hard or dropping them can result in broken limbs, paralysis,  or death. 

Furthermore they need unlimited hay 100% of the time. There are kinda that people are less allergic too, but it can still cause issues.

Third, they generally live 5-8 years and you'll need yearly check ups. You'll need to find a Cavy Savvy vet (someone who specializes in guinea pigs). This is usually an exotics vet. Each visit will likely cost around $100. They need this to keep tabs on their health, and the vet can check things you can't see, like their back teeth.

Fourth they need a cup of fresh veggies per day. Usually romaine or butter lettuce is good. Occasionally you have to give them bell peppers. It's high in Vitamin C, which you need to prevent scurvy. Too much calcium in their diet can cause bladder stones. Too much sugar can cause diabetes. An improper diet drastically shortens their lifespan.

You need two. They're extremely social. You'll need at least a 2x3 foot cage. Store bought cages are too small. 

If they ever escape, expect to never see them again. They're liable to get eaten, overheat, or freeze to death.

Also they poop a lot.

Guinea pigs are a lot of work, but for an older child, they could be a good pet as long as you do most of the work and supervise her while handling."

5427,best home improvement store,"Home Depot is my go to.  Their plumbing and electrical section (for me) has a better selection.  In general they end up a little cheaper.

For fixtures (lights, hardware, sinks) I shop at both."
10918,best backpack for college,"I don't know who would really disagree with this. TNF backpacks are really well rated and great city packs, Just not the best for actual outdoors weight/space ratio. I love my recon, so this is my recommendation as well. The padding is all super comfy. Has a ton of space. Looks good. Definitely my favorite of the function based pricier options 

If you want something cheaper I'd just get a jansport. I've been ripping the label off of them since middle school and they're a great minimal canvas backpack."
3191,best webcamera,I personally use the Logitech c920 webcam.  Based on personal taste. Others may feel other cameras are better but for me I've had zero problems while using it for over a year and a half so far. Plug and play and quick to setup.  Chroma key is a breeze via obs using the c920 as well.

66444,best soccer team in the world,~~You~~ Colombia should have beaten us in Copa America. I feel we got lucky that match and Peru brought us back down to earth in semis.
66227,best soccer team in the world,"Why you say that? Comparing Barca's european titles vs Milan the difference isn't that great and Barcelona as always being stronger locally that Milan ever was. Barca even as more socis that Milan ever dreamed of. 

I'm not saying one is on top of the other but I don't think is as cut and dry as you make it out to be."

30608,best Mexican war to study,"> Civil war - justified because the south had no grievances worth secession. There has to be a bar set for any type of declaration of independence.

This could potentially be an interesting discussion. Where exactly would you set that bar?"
