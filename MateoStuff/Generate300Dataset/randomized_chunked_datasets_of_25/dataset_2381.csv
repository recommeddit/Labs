26101,best politician,"Lincoln. The man was woefully unprepared for the job. He was an unexperienced, third tier candidate nominated by an infant party. One would doubt his ability to govern effectively in good times given the novelty of his party and slight resume, yet he gets elected amid the most catastrophic event in American history. He got the nation through the civil war with nothing more than intellect, reason, and good decision making. People don't really know this about Lincoln, but he was a chronic depressive prone to melancholy. The nation was on her death bed and Lincoln was able to overcome his personal demons and defficiencies to grind out a victory."

55218,best places to hike in the east coast,"Um, our economy depends on them. When the Air Force Base closed in my hometown the Canadians coming down to shop got us through it. Now it's one of the top micro-cities in the country and the only city to not only get back to where they where pre-base closing but to be doing better. They may be annoying, camp out for weeks at a time on the Wal-Mart parking lot, and inexplicably purchase shopping cart loads of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (I've seen this more times than I can count) but with out them it would no longer exist."
