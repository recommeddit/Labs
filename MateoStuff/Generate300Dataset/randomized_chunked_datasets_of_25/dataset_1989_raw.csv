"T-Mobile is gearing up to do a massive upgrade of its network through 2015, converting all of its 2G towers to LTE towers."
"Note that this is the ""original"" in the sense that it's the original edit of the actual original comic. If memory serves, the actual original had the punchline from the last panel in the third panel, and the last three panels weren't there."
"Maybe those expectations have been built up a little too much with reddit alone. The pictures you see on r/pics from switzerlane are insane. But chances are, there is a busstop really close to it because everything is so well connected. ^^

But I just recently realised that the place where i live (5 min from a big sea, around it a snowy mountain range, and it‘s still more than warm enough to bathe in summer) is actually a lot of peoples dream place to live."
"As someone who has the same values and beliefs as him, I believe he was recklessly divisive. He got wrapped up in the bravado of the other two and started promising things he couldn’t back up. 

For example, we both want free college. He acted as though reducing the cost of college wasn’t good enough, but didn’t acknowledge that congress would have blocked any tax reform that would allow that to actually happen. False promises are harmful, regardless of who says them. 

His supporters are overall higher educated than others, so I would like to believe that they could have handled the discussion in a less “scream your views at people until they agree with you” method. He frequently lost his cool, and modeled that for others. 

What’s frustrating is that I was a fan of his long before he ran, yet I spent half of the election arguing with people that should have agreed with me. People acted like he was above reproach, and no one is."
"Itbreally depends on the shoe. Flyknit allowas them to have different pressure in different part of the shoe.

In my experience, it Is quite tight in the beginning and loosens after some break in"
"Usually works best staying at one chain to build up status.  I’m a fan of the Marriott chain. Fairfield / Springhill for economy, Residence Inn is great with kids, bigger rooms.  Marriott / Renaissance for a nice stay.  All there luxury hotels are pretty nice."
"Denmark have a better system and the players have clear roles and chemistry. With that a team can be bigger than the sum of its parts. 

Netherlands feels like France."
"Linux is very common for Physics. When I worked at a Physics institute, nearly everyone used Linux. OP is right that they should start learning Linux."
"PS4 and it's not even close. I loved Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, but have barely touched my Switch since those games. Many of the releases since have been ports of games I bought on Wii U. Also, the joycons are absolutely awful. Horrible, cheap joysticks that are way too inaccurate for FPS, Rocket League, etc. I've never been an Xbox guy and prefer those titles on my PC."
This sounds like a dream job to me. I'm a very independent person and this seems like a great way to see the world.

"Haha, that’s the only reason I picked them up in the first place, too! If I hadn’t found them at a crazy sale price, I probably wouldn’t have tried them at all. In my opinion, Horizon is the standout, it’s just nothing revolutionary."
GNUCash works for people who want pen and ledger style accounting.
"high in salt, which you lose when you sweat too much, this is the premise behind gatorade... although it seems maybe too high in salt."

Not even Spader could save it for me. Love that man's acting talent but that is just a horrible show. I was so distracted by the lead actress' wig. I felt like I was constantly watching an 80s show with a stunt double with a bad wig who got left in the scene.
"Vodka and cheap Popsicles. Put the Popsicle into vodka and stir until the Popsicle is gone.

Apparently Popsicle HAS to be capitalized on Reddit."

I enjoyed Children of the Sky, but I think we need a sequel now. It's been a few years...."

This is how it was taught in college for me. Polk said “I want that land.” Then he went and got it.

"If they're separate on BGG, they're separate here. One bad game in a family that no one plays would unfairly tank the whole thing. (Plus that'd be a whole lot of manual labor, so, no thanks.) 

A separate top list of the game families (or other groupings) would be interested, though."
Icarus or CitizenFour - both are must watch but for vastly different reasons.
