71837,best movies with a cool twist,"My friend figured it out from the trailer like a month or two before the movie came out. Once he said it, it just made so much sense in my head that I was never able to watch the movie."
30484,best Mexican war to study,"I find American history incredibly boring. I love learning about Eastern European wars, especially before guns came into the picture."
71256,best movies with a cool twist,"The perfect example. It is completely unexpected, and is devastating to both the main character and the audience.

It also retroactively alters the context of the entire conflict up to this point, and changes the trajectory of the story going forward. 

It throws you off balance while simultaneously deepening the entire narrative."
31833,best hotel to live in,Definitely gonna hit the pizza spot up lol
51856,best iphone case,"I ordered 5 different cases and tried them all for a few days, not as many as you but with free returns...why not?

This is the best (and one of the only) true bumper cases for the iPhone 12, and it's awesome: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RJV4NQF/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_EGWMNS0SCZZX9Q2K3VFW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

Have it on my phone now. Works with magsafe, protects all corners, and feels like there is nothing on the phone at all. Back has a nice semi-clear anti-fingerprint coating which actually works (no smudges at all!). Can't beat the price either and looks great with the graphite color."

38551,best newspapers to read,Thank you from the bottom of a reporter's heart.
31726,best hotel to live in,"It's a suite, so probably about twice the size as a 'normal' hotel room.  It has a living room with a couch, computer desk, dinner table and kitchen counter.  The bedroom is your typical setup.  I don't have any pictures and I'm not there now, but I can post some later if people are interested."
38189,best newspapers to read,"WSJ, NYT, WaPo, Boston Globe (from MA im just gonna toss that one in there). They are all paying subscriptions. NOTE: these are all the cream of the crop on journalism here but are kind of out of touch and elitist. It’s not just right wingers who think that. Just keep that in mind as you read. I read these all the time cause nothing compares but they also have problems sometimes with corruption so it can be hard on some issues to get a fair view"
