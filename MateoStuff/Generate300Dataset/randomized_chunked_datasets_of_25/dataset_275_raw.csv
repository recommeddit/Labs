"All of Mous’s YouTube advertising got to me - getting the Mous Limitless 3.0 (for IPhone 11 Pro).

This is my first iPhone.  I’ve used OtterBox Commuters on all of my Androids but I’m tired of the two-piece system and wanted to try something new - hope I don’t regret it.  They’ve protected my phones from a lot of falls and even an accidental throw of sorts."
"They don't put ""the standard by which other sci-fi is judged"" (paraphrased) on the cover of Iain M. Banks books for nothing, so it's a head scratcher for why Use of Weapons, or The Player of Games is missing from the list."
"These were my starters. Agreed. I got some Audio Technicas for the office, but still prefer these."
The Naked Prey
Texas.  I had a house and car but I sold it.  I'm trying to push the boundaries of minimalism.
Does work pay for your hotel or is it out of pocket?

"I'm an ER doctor and I see patients with the cold all the time. I endorse your statement of asking the pharmacist first and buying generics. But also, consider calling a primary doctor on day 1, because you often can't get an appointment for 3-5 days with a PCP in USA. If you took your symptom meds and feel better, great, just cancel the appointment the day before. If you don't feel better, you now have a clinician to listen to your lungs and maybe get a chest X-ray in case a more serious illness like pneumonia is developing. Seeing the PCP is waaaay cheaper than coming to the ER. Your ER copay may be the same cost as a whole PCP visit."
"Tobey Maguire gave the performance the movies needed for that era. His earnest performance grounds the movie in emotional truth, and then that allowed Raimi to allow the environment and world around him to be cartoon/comic like while still having audience buy-in. It's like Mark Hamill in the first Star Wars, we needed earnestness to buy into the rest of the world.

Andrew Garfield came across as smug and unlikeable to me. 

&#x200B;

Tom is solid, but I feel like the script for his solo outing held him back. He's not getting a chance to explore the pathos of Peter Parker, and that makes it feel like a fast food/diet brand version of Spidey. He's a very charming and likeable lead, though."
"Lmao, manual brushes... What is this, the middle ages?"
I'll be there Wednesday for ground school! Hoping for PM blue skies.
"AFAIK there are no 24"" 144hz 1080p IPS panels.

There are a few affordable 1080p 144hz VA panels.

It is assumed the budget VAs all use the same panel as the Samsung C24FG70/C24FG73, just without the quantum dot:

1. Acer ED242QR

2. MSI Optix G24C/Optix MAG24C(this version costs more because it has a better stand)

3. then of course there's the Samsung C24FG70/C24FG73."
I'll have to check it out!
"I meant more in the pick and play aspect, you don’t need to commit to playing it"
"Plan A - be born here

Plan B - ..."
It's a real shame how heavily typecast he was. He's a great actor.
"just bought the AUKEY Power Bank Portable Charger, it was 18w input and output and can charge and power at the same time, git it a look"
"booming, beautiful city"
I have done this and can testify that it is as awesome as it sounds!
"I walked into the theater not knowing ANYTHING about this beyond that it seemed to be modeled directly from that weird married couple that was on CNN a few years ago. That said, my date fell asleep (craft beer hit her hard), and I was basically sitting on the edge of my seat saying ""what...the...fuck"" over and over again."
"A top 5 won't be enough, but a top 10 will. Here's my list in no order:

- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

- Persona 5

- Bloodborne

- Horizon: Zero Dawn

- Fallout 4

- Nier: Automata

- Nioh

- Dark Souls 3

- Diablo 3

- Final Fantasy XV"
I think you need to specify the operating system. Excel for Windows is by far the best. Excel for Mac is hot garbage.
"I totally agree. Season 9 was one of the most perfect TV seasons I've ever watched, and 10 was also one of their best. It's amazing they can still keep it so fresh a decade later."
"I'm pretty new to VPN, still shopping around for options. I hope someone can answer this question, Is it safe to use other devices in the household without vpn while torrenting with vpn on the main computer?"
"Haha, I like them so much I'm considering buying one of the mini ones as a more day to day bag! I was really skeptical at first but I'm shocked at how much I ended up liking it. I think they deserve the hype they get here in California. They do sell them at ASOS if you're at all curious at looking at one in person. 

Edit: subtly realizes ASOS is an online store. brain fart"
