You can believe me when I tell you: they'll fuck with your baggage regardless of what you do.
Definitely stick with light force.  The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be...unnatural.
New Girl!!
"Ah yes magic wand, same one Michael Scott used for Magic Camp."
How do you get all these on Unc0ver?
"There's actually a Korean BBQ place on upper State, I think it's called iGrill."
"I like Terraforming Mars fine, but it shouldn't be ranked nearly as high as it is IMO. 

It's a perfectly fine engine builder game, but with some incredibly glaring flaws. There are just so many other games that deserve it's spot that I can't believe it's so highly considered."
"Ayana Resort in Bali! We usually stay at smaller and cheaper accommodations for holidays, but that time my Dad allowed us to splurge a bit. Money well spent!"
"I just try to keep a (hopefully somewhat self aware) sense of humor about it. I go to a Catholic University, so when I pull the ol' ""I'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven"" line out, it usually gets a little chuckle. Most people don't think the Catholics appreciate humor, but it's worked for me so far. And if my core friend group gives me a good ribbing, I just quote MSI to them ""I'm gonna conform. I'm gonna play ball. I make a sacrifice, because I want it all ^^awee-oo-weeoo!"" 

And like, yeah, we're not directly curing cancer or anything, but when someone does, how are they going to get their drug to market? Through us. Or people like us, anyway."
"It's been letting reddit ads slip through lately. Kind of annoying. Also, use it in conjunction with uBlock Origin Extra. Picks up more things and specifically the things that get annoyed you're using an adblocker."
"It depends on how you choose to renew your plan. The 12GB plan is $25/mo for the first 3 months as an introductory offer for new customers. When you go to renew your plan, you have 3 options:

1. Renew for 3 months at $45/mo
2. Renew for 6 months at $35/mo
3. Renew for 12 months at $25/mo

It's possible to continue getting the 12GB/$25 price, so I keep it listed that way in the comparison chart. Similarly, all plans are listed with their auto-pay discounts applied."
That’s good to see!
I dont see zinc anywhere on the list??
Do you know if there will be another season?
"I've heard generations of poor people (e.g. kids, their parents, and grandparents) all say the and thing about brushing their teeth with baking soda. And how much they hate it and often prefer to not brush their teeth at all than use baking soda. So I don't think there's a similarly priced toothpaste or else they would have found it. Baking soda is 89 cents for like an 8 oz carton, which lasts probably 100+ brushes.  I doubt the dollar store toothpaste can compete with that.  But I will look next time I'm there to see if an option exists."
"Data Science from Scratch is definitely my favorite introductory text.
It has a great bare-bones introduction to Python to get you up and running, and has you actually build up some ml algorithms to better grasp what they're doing under the hood."
If your gasoline car is an outback XT you’re lying lol
Atom is another choice.
Carnage is a better symbiote. Change my mind.
"Since it's a security issue, Hijaxios?"
"It doesn't really have a name, I just made the name up based on a similarly structured joke about elephants in France. An old man is sprinkling salt in the streets to keep the elephants away and <insert punchline>

I figured the joke is at least well know enough that someone will know what I'm talking about."
"[look mom, i've got rabies](http://i.imgur.com/ZnI3Z.jpg)"
"I’m not trying to be a Nate Silver apologist but Silver often says the 2012 elections were easy and that he shouldn’t be praised so highly for that prediction since there was so little uncertainty. 538 lacks transparency in its models but they’re driving traffic not publishing. 

And that article jumped on its high horse early on Election Day to say 538’s results were obviously wrong but in retrospect it’s the only model that gave the actual winner a reasonable chance. Maybe it’s not a strictly rigorous model but it worked best in a situation of high uncertainty whereas every other model was over confident in the face of uncertainty."
"The newer NfS: Hot Pursuit does get progressively more difficult as you play, and based on how well you do nets you more cars and gets you new technology to take on/down racers and cops alike. Not exactly as you want it to be, but the progression is there."
That's a fucking beautiful area of the country.
