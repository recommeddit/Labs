65905,best college in california,"Does it, though? These public universities have incredible prestige as aggregate institutions, but they result in really large class sizes for most undergrads. There are instances of people needing five years to graduate because they can’t get the classes they want. The research output is of course phenomenal, but I’m not sure that translates to college. Keep in mind this is the undergrad ranking. UCB is almost always among the global T20 universities and sometimes T10, of which it’s quite deserving."

53526,best medicine for a cold,"See that's why I don't get the point of making the Rx anyway when docs are more than happy to Rx them when they know they won't do anything at all. I've literally had a doc say ""it's viral so antibiotics won't help but I'll write you a Rx anyway in case it does help any."" Like wtf? And I hadn't been asking for them or anything; in fact, after the doc said that I said not to bother if it's not actually helpful, as I didn't want the extra expense and pills for no good reason. They shrugged and gave me the Rx ""in case you change your mind."" Ffffff thanks???"

23586,best car racing video game,"Yeah I actually enjoyed the progression curve quite a bit. It was the first time in a while that a racing game made me feel accomplished when I got a new car/part. This was coming from Forza Horizon 4 though, where the game gives you free cars basically every time you log in, so I guess it's a low bar to set."

30478,best Mexican war to study,"Favorite war ATM: (Not really a war I guess) Invasion of England in 1066. Harold Godwinson almost won...almost. He fuckin' had to beat off two invading armies at once, without the support of any other country or the Papacy, and he came within one cavalry charge of victory.
