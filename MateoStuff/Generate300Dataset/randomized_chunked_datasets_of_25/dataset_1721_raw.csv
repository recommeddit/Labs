"I would add the ""The Mysterious Island"" by Jules Vernes to the list above.
Check out any of Edgar Rice Burroughs's books.
My personal favorites are

* Barsoom series
* Tarzan series
* Caspak series"
"I love Bath and Body Works ""Sea Island Cotton"". Best scent."
"100% get clank in space. It offers a lot more of what people wanted from the original game.

One of the biggest problems with the original was that if someone chooses to race down and grab a easy treasure and race out it can make the game feel a little rushed, but their isn't much you can do about it. A few other down falls would be less variation of maps compared to ""in space"" which has modular vs. 1 board.

With Clank in space each player has to 'hack' (activate) 2 computers in 2 of the 3 modules before they can enter the treasure room. This mission aspect makes for a much more enjoyable game and makes the game play a bit longer, but not overly long, while removing the rush strategy. It also gives you a chance to really play with the deck you build vs. the game being over before you can play most cards after acquiring. 

In addition it also adds a ton of extra features that improve the overall enjoyment of playing the game like bounty hunters, which when drawn hit all players, not just one. Another cool addition is the factions, which adds another layer to your strategy when building your deck. 

You won't be disappointed with it, I've had so many people go out and buy this game after playing it with me (i didnt even tell them to) because it's just something you'll want to have in your collection.

one last note, at it's core it's a really easy game to learn and i'd even consider it a gate way game for non games with enough depth that vet will enjoy it too."
">fetch is also not supported on the backend with node and perhaps other uses of JS where I think axios is?(there is also node-fetch for node users). There is a rather long issue about it on nodes github about adding fetch and it doesn't seem like it'll happen. Sooo... in this case it can just be use axios frontend or backend, remember how to use just that and not bother about switching between the two.

&#x200B;

There's a handy package called \`node-fetch\` - it's [mentioned in the compatibility section.](https://danlevy.net/you-may-not-need-axios/#compatibility) of my article. It's no worse than having to install any other 3rd party lib, however you get symmetry between front-end and back-end code."
Now *this* caught my attention :O will check it out!!

"The Al case ones are a bit more rugged.   A fellow hiker had her Anker burst into flames, INSIDE her backpack, due it getting dropped and cracked."
Ew david!

"FYI, though whole body sunlight will indeed give you a lot of Vitamin D, around 30,000 IU with 15-30 minutes exposure, it takes a *long* time for it to get from the skin to the blood.  And serum Vitamin D is where it does its best work.  So if you need Vitamin D in a hurry, like when you are showing symptoms, first take D3 supplements, which will quickly get into your blood.  Then sunlight on top of that is great."

"I find, unless you're a twitch-shooter type gamer, that reds tend to be too sensitive without any bump. I prefer using Brown switches as a good compromise. Typing can be a real pain on red switches, in my experience."

"Stay away from DeVry (unless someone else is paying the bill) and University of Phoenix.  Way over priced.

Look into Western Governers Univeristy (WGU) and SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University)-they have wonderful online degree options.

Ohio state and Temple University also have some great online degrees/classes.  Far more legit than DeVry."
"Im thinking of buying a webcam. Is these issues common for this webcam, would the c920 be better?"
"Lol thank you for doing all the heavy lifting.

The other problem with *Infinity War* is just that the ending means nothing. Everyone knows that Black Panther isn’t fuckin dead. *Endgame* gets all the credit for doing anything interesting with *Infinity War*’s ending. 

Having the first hour be so reflective on their failure and Thanos’s early fate are **legitimately** surprising, while the ending of *Infinity War* does nothing but have people go “oh boy can’t wait to see how they reverse this”"
I don't play fast twitchy competitive games so I go with my normal preference which is Gateron Greens by about 1000 miles.
Fantastical if you are in the Apple ecosystem
"This is what killed racing games for me. 

I used to love them. 

It doesn’t matter anymore if you are good or bad at the game. The AI will always adjust to be just slightly worse than you."
"I’m not aware of a show that is exactly Hardcore Biology— but I’ve looked around quite a bit for science podcasts and these are some of my favorites:

Generation Anthropocene
Somewhat radiolab-esque show from Stanford 

Past Time 
Small, amazing paleontology show!!

Podship Earth 
New and very promising!

In Our Time
science stream at least—this is a big BBC show that interviews experts on a wide variety of topics 

Radio Ecoshock
Obviously, pretty depressing to listen to a lot 

Resistance Radio
Small show that needs better audio quality. He gets the best guests and is an amazing interviewer, this just isn’t one to listen to anywhere with background noise 

For The Wild
Some episodes are amazing, some just too hippy. Very compassionate host



None of these are exactly what you want, but they all have had episodes you’ll find interesting. We need more good biology podcasts out there!!  If you end up doing a new show, definitely let us know!"
My sister in law named her dog Fenton because of this
Sunshine Mimosa from bath body works. I got it for less than $5 and I love it! It smells so juicy on me and actually last 4 hours which is decent considering the price. I also picked up Gingham for $5.50 and I do not know what it is about that one but I like it. It’s VERY different from anything I’ve ever smelled but I really like the smell. Don’t know how to describe it.
I forgot I totally did this! Highly recommend WP for eyeglasses. Prescription lenses is included as well
"My dad always wears slippers around the house. When I was ten, and doing pottery in art class at school, I got the strange idea to make him a clay slipper with a rocket on the back and wings on the side. As far as I can recall, there is no interesting or touching story associated with it. My dad is pretty no-nonsense, he doesn't have a weird or ironic sense of humour or anything, but that slipper still sits on the mantle, 20 years later. I think it's just been there for so long it's never occurred to him to take it down."
