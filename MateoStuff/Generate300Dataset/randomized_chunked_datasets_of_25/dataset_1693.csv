56842,"Hi everyone,

I've been looking into the samsung odyssey G7 series of monitors. However I have some questions regarding this monitor. Since this monitor is not cheap I want to be as thorough as possible. Anyway, far as I can see its has two models produced one being Samsung Odyssey G7 C32G75TQSUX and the other being Samsung Odyssey G7 LC32G75TQSUXEN now the question I have is whats the difference between the C32 model and the LC32 is one better than the other is the other one newer and so on, is there much of a difference between these two and should I pay attention to this. I can imagine the diffrence is that one model is a from a different factory production line however im not sure about this. So if anyone could clarify which these I should get or whats the difference I would apreciate it greatly.

And if anyone else already has this monitor I'd be happy to know whats your experience been with it :)

Thanks everyone",best desktop monitor

For home ec one time, we sewed together sweatshirts with a design of our choosing, from whatever type of catalog we were using at the time. I picked out a pattern that had a design of a cheetah, hanging from a tree limb, and there's a quote that says ""just hangin' around"" on it. I gave it to my father for father's day like, 22 years ago, and I'll still go to his house and see him wearing this fucking old ass ""just hangin' around"" sweatshirt. Cracks me up inside every time I see it.",best gifts for dad

To give ideas of something gym appropriate though I'd say just anything clean, fresh, generic and weak performing. A few that come to mind are Cool Water, Diesel Only The Brave, K EDT or YSL Y EDT",best cologne

If this list is solely for this year (or the pace they were on for this year since Dak got injured) then Aaron Rodgers shouldn't be the 3rd QB on the list.

He was really nice and easy to talk to (and does actually wear the hat out and about). I told him that watching his show with my dad as a kid was part of what made me want to be an engineer and he actually got really excited about that. Just a super cool guy overall.

It all  basically boils down to is what kind of panel you want - TN or IPS. You can google if you don't know - there are tons of information about this.  
With G-sync and those parameters that you want there is literally only 3 different TN monitors and 2 IPS (3 on the website but 2 of them are practically the same thing).",best gaming monitor
