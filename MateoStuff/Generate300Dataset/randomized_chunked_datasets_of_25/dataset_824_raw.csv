"Mmm.. my friend has some Frenzy he lets me get in on every now and then. That there DMAA is crazy strong.

Edit: Shit nvm frenzy doesn't have DMAA. Frenzy still guud tho."
I wish more people understood this.
I've got noise gate and noise suppression so I'd be fine ðŸ˜‚
"Error handling is expensive though, which means it's more than just pedantry over semantics - errors should be used in exceptional cases

Getting a 404 isn't a faulty request - the request was fine. But it was for something that wasn't possible to give"
Parrot now is where it is at.

"I'd start with Full Throttle, Goliath, Twisted Colossus, Scream, Batman, Riddler's. Then work over to Ninja, Tatsu and X2. This takes a methodical approach around the park. The order posted by the other user has you running back and forth across a very large park between each ride which isn't very efficient."
Dragons dogma!
Coherence FOR SURE

"Yes but overall there was sizable portion of people who were gullible enough to fall for his shit. Plus, even if nobody voted for him, he is still the president of your countey so that right there is enough for me to make the judgement that thr US is not the best place to live."

"[Henry Stewart Talks](http://hstalks.com/main/index_category.php?id=252).  Not a podcast, but tons of great lectures."
"iPhone 6s for sure. It is still fast and zippy today and still being supported by Apple. 

The worst one would be the iPhone 6 and 6 plus. The bendgate issue really killed them. I replaced my iPhone 6 plus that time twice and it would still give me the ghost touch."
Yes you should. I got mine in January 2020 to replace my aging 6s. Itâ€™s a great device! Hey same I donâ€™t play games on my phone either ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
Crystal Geyser. This stuff makes my GERD worse. Plus it tastes bad.
"I love Ilona Andrews' books and have re-read all their series multiple times. I read almost all romance sub-genres and non-romantic fiction/sci-fi/fantasy too but I especially love world-building storytelling and the way Ilona Andrews has done that in each of their series (and also included romantic relationships) is \*chef's kiss\* good. I would recommend their books to any reader but I think those who read mostly contemporary or historical romances aren't interested in a urban fantasy series. They are missing out!

I have been going through a book slump for the last few weeks and with their newest release in their Hidden Legacy series, ""Emerald Blaze"", I started re-reading the 1st in that series to catch myself up. Book slump officially gone."

"Consumer Reports has at least one article about this. Check your local public library's website, in the magazines section, to see if you can get a temporary subscription using your library card. I know my public library has it."
"Dave Chappelle and his family live a few miles from where I went to college, and he and I frequented the same Starbucks. I ran into him about ten times. One day he sat with me for about 45 minutes and talked about screenwriting. It was amazing. Heâ€™s as down to earth as his stage persona suggests, and itâ€™s no wonder he opted to raise his family away from L.A."
Not a degree. Iâ€™m currently working on my 2nd degree I wish I would of gone to trade school instead for welding.
