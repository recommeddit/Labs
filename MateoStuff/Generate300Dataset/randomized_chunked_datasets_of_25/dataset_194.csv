59932,best perfume,"Sweet and spicy. Peaceful. Ginger and frankincense, with a touch of orange, patchouli,  vetiver, and the littlest bit of violet. It gives the sense of vanilla, cinnamon, and anise, despite not including those elements. It’s a very comforting scent. 

In my desperation, I actually bought half ounces of each of the 6 component notes from Demeter. (Demeter has a whole bunch of single note fragrances, some way better than others).  They also sell a blending kit with an empty perfume bottle, little pipettes, etc. 

I experimented with blending the notes, trying to capture an impression of TMT. I found that the ginger and frankincense notes were the main players (to my nose), with the other notes blending to provide accompaniment. 

At first I was really excited with my result, but then I compared it to my last drops of real TMT. If real TMT is a 10 in complexity and intensity, my concoction was maybe a 4-5. I just couldn’t manage the strength and blend with the tools at hand. Demeter’s sprays are famously short lived with poor longevity, although some are exceptions. And some just smell amazing, so you don’t mind that they are short lived (Ginger Ale, Angel Food, Wet Garden, imho). 

I’ve read reviews here and in the indiemakeupandmore sub, following the recommendations of others searching for their TMT fix. Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab makes Shub Niggurath, which touches upon some of the notes. (BPAL’s Plunder is also in the neighborhood.) Someone mentioned Hexennacht’s Inferno (now also discontinued!) as a cousin, and I do indeed like it as a cinnamonny relative of TMT. I have yet to try Poesie’s Shy Ghost, which I also read was similar. But so far, nothing has really captured the TMT essence, which is weird to me, as it is so nice. I would think it would be repeated somewhere!

The search continues, though."

33,best terminal file manager reddit,"Same here. There was also [DOS Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Navigator), NC on steroids - was very sad when it's development ended. MC is better that NC, but not even touching the level on DOS Navigator... ahhh, good'ol'days..."

Wanna be starting something - Michael Jackson  
State of Emergency - Skindred

17126,best iOS game,Cyrus 1 and 2 seem to be 2 bucks each
33880,best Pokemon game,"Start with either diamond or heartgold. Diamond is good because there aren’t many Pokémon and also it is fairly easy imo. Heartgold has a lot more Pokémon because it has the gen2 Pokédex and I think also the gen3. So yeah, try both of them"
72007,best movies with a cool twist,8 years later and I think I'm probably still confused by that movie.
54365,best medicine for a cold,Sambucol ! asap tabs and liquid
52811,best hiphop album,Forest Hills Drive
66863,best soccer team in the world,I wish they would use names instead of shapes and flags for us Americans on here. They don’t teach us that other countries exist.
15196,best tree for the garden,Same as I feel about Dogwoods. I think they can definitely have problems also. I have four in my yard in Ga . Planted them almost thirty years ago. They grow beautiful without any problems. I planted two pink dogwoods before planting a third white in the place of the other two that fell ill with disease. I have three Japanese Magnolias (Tulip trees) that are twenty-five years and going strong and gorgeous. The property had three beautiful fully mature pecan trees unfortunately one blew over during storms from Hurricane Katrina. I’m not familiar with hackleberry trees so much.
56438,best desktop monitor,It is only good as a secondary screen. You really need a smaller screen tbh
53328,best usb c charging cable,"I love nylon braided cable.

I have a positive with UGreen USB-C to Lightning. The price is affordable and good quality workmanship.
Also a great Anker.

I haven't tried the Nomads because they are not available in Europe.
Belkin more expensive than the competition."

58496,best cologne,I've had compliments on Varvatos Star USA and Varvatos Vintage. Vintage smells more woody and musky. USA smells more clean and crisp.
67637,axios alternatives reddit,"Well it's usually not a decisions made so much as a situation that arises. Nobody decided to stop maintaining it, it just steadily becomes something other than the top priority for anyone involved.

Also once you start raising money, then there's all sorts of other admin work you need to take care of. Where does it go, by what service is it collected, how is it distributed. Also ratchets up the stress, cuz now you're responsible for people's livelihood."

30087,best money managing app,"YNAB costs a lot these days, but it's a serious solution for those of us who want one. I used Mint for maybe a year, but realized I needed a more robust system. I've been using YNAB ever since, 4 years now."
