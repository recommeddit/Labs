In my desperation, I actually bought half ounces of each of the 6 component notes from Demeter. (Demeter has a whole bunch of single note fragrances, some way better than others).  They also sell a blending kit with an empty perfume bottle, little pipettes, etc. 

I experimented with blending the notes, trying to capture an impression of TMT. I found that the ginger and frankincense notes were the main players (to my nose), with the other notes blending to provide accompaniment. 

At first I was really excited with my result, but then I compared it to my last drops of real TMT. If real TMT is a 10 in complexity and intensity, my concoction was maybe a 4-5. I just couldn’t manage the strength and blend with the tools at hand. Demeter’s sprays are famously short lived with poor longevity, although some are exceptions. And some just smell amazing, so you don’t mind that they are short lived (Ginger Ale, Angel Food, Wet Garden, imho). 

I’ve read reviews here and in the indiemakeupandmore sub, following the recommendations of others searching for their TMT fix. Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab makes Shub Niggurath, which touches upon some of the notes. (BPAL’s Plunder is also in the neighborhood.) Someone mentioned Hexennacht’s Inferno (now also discontinued!) as a cousin, and I do indeed like it as a cinnamonny relative of TMT. I have yet to try Poesie’s Shy Ghost, which I also read was similar. But so far, nothing has really captured the TMT essence, which is weird to me, as it is so nice. I would think it would be repeated somewhere!

The search continues, though.",best perfume

15196,Same as I feel about Dogwoods. I think they can definitely have problems also. I have four in my yard in Ga . Planted them almost thirty years ago. They grow beautiful without any problems. I planted two pink dogwoods before planting a third white in the place of the other two that fell ill with disease. I have three Japanese Magnolias (Tulip trees) that are twenty-five years and going strong and gorgeous. The property had three beautiful fully mature pecan trees unfortunately one blew over during storms from Hurricane Katrina. I’m not familiar with hackleberry trees so much.,best tree for the garden
