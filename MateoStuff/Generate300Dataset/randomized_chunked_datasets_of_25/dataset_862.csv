23602,"there is an indie game called Art of Rally. Highly recommend it

The career mode is a progression through the history of rally racing, you start off with crap cars from the 60s and work your way to modern cars. Group B is when shit gets real.

edit: also NFS Heat is really, really good. My only complaint is that the game is too damn short. but the grind to level 50 is so fun. (also, there are amazing mods for this game too if you are into that)",best car racing video game

It seems like hot weather and frequent DCFC does negatively impact the battery, so I definitely want to be careful with that.

25361,"Huh? Her character being poorly written is a commonly accepted fact about the trilogy. I don't get it why does it surprise you.

Yes, she has no traits and no individuality. She's really bland and her character is non-existent .  
Her backstory is there, yes, but I said it wasn't explored that much.  
Her relationship with Peter weren't properly explored even after the graduation. What we saw was a couple of poorly written cliche romantic dialogues.

Except he wasn't in love with her in the comics. He find her extremely beautiful and that's it. It wasn't until much later when he found out that there's actually a character in her.   
It's fine on it's own, but not when it becomes a trope that is repeated in every movie again and again.",best spiderman actor
