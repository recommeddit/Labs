"They didn't leave that out at all, I just watched it."
"for sure! i think she “jokes” a lot about being amazing, and I dated a true narc who did the same all the time. I always brushed it off until more behavior led me to believe that he lacked empathy.  I think both her and scott have a similar narc-like sense of humor and both have shown disregard for others. i have a love/hate relationship with her because she truly seems like she has tried to learn and be better.  still lots of hypocrisy though ... “don’t use perfume it’s bad for you, but wait, here’s a toxic diamond perfume for you!!”"
"We usually get a few hobos, and they get candy, too. Just don't compliment their costume."
"As someone who had a CG for ten years (and then sold it for $250), I went with a north face and while it's not $1000, the $400 Gotham jacket has kept me warm even when feel like drops below 20 Celsius. From the warmth standpoint, they both perform very closely.

The quality of stitching and the zipper is what could fail on the north face versus CG which uses large sturdy zippers and in ten years I did not have a single rip. Let's not kid ourselves, ones made in Canada and ones made in China.. I'm still a strong believer that products made in North America or Europe are of superior quality. The price difference though I couldn't convince myself to get a CG again, so I'm hoping I'm wrong about north face and that it will last long."
"I really don't know! I saw on the internet a bunch of people in that same situation.

I personally found it was extremely clunky and unsatisfying at the beginning, it turned me off instantly. I said to myself, ""people are praising this and I can't even like the guy walking?"" or even ""there are better underrated games out there, why do I wanna play what everyone else is playing?"". 

But I realized that not every game is the same and I need to open my mind to different styles, artistically and technically speaking. 

The Witcher 3 was very different from the kind of games I would play, even compared to Skyrim if we're talking about western RPGs. It felt a bit off, but the more I played it, the more I got into it and understood the praise.

&#x200B;

Even today, I still say that the game is clunky and the combat mechanics can become a bit repetitive with no feeling of progression. But the rest is absolute madness, it's insane the work they put into it and I feel like the 20€ I spent on the game aren't enough for what it is."
"1. PS3 (got me back into gaming after a long absence/amazing library of games. Also plays PS1 games)
2. NES (my first console)
3. PS Vita (the best portable ever created. Would likely still make the list if P4G was the only game ever released for it.)
4. Wii (Wii games/GC games/ Virtual Console!)
5. SNES"
"There’s an app that can turn your phone into a webcam specifically for OBS in the App Store and the one time purchase to unlock everything is $16.99 so much cheaper than a webcam :) I’ve tested it and it works great! Been using my iPhone 8 with it. It gives you different quality settings too, like medium, HD, 4K. Just make sure to mute the mic within the app so you’re not double layering your mic audio"

Haha. Thanks
"A Mojito at [El Mason de Pepe](http://www.elmesondepepe.com/) in Key West. Absolutely perfect - not too sweet, not too minty, with a little umami courtesy of a few drops of bitters."
"It should be noted that you can't be simple, like myself, for CS. If you don't know what you're getting yourself into in terms of stress and the the amount of time that it requires you will not be a happy person. Also if you're bad at time management it might be worthwhile exploring other options."

"Who says I didn't?  I never specified my School.  (Columbia Southern University, FWIW) 

My point is, I'm good at what I do- but your company would never have the opportunity to know that because you'd have tossed my resume in the trash, because you ""Don't trust the degree"".  

Like I pointed out to the smart ass HR kid that I had to interview with along the process of getting the job I have now- he graduated from UCLA.  Mom and Dad paid for it.  He didn't have a job through college except for internships.  He didn't have a mortgage, a kid going through school that HE had to pay for, two other kids in middle and high school, bills to pay, and two soul crushing jobs, a family to hold together, four rental houses to maintain, He didn't have to do anything but make it to class, turn in roughly the same amount of work I did, if not less.  And I am not complaining...I just had all the responsibilities that grown folks do, and people who counted on me.  

Now who's better at managing time, allocating resources, prioritizing tasks, not to mention leading others?  At least, who's *demonstrated* that?"

"Solaris by Stanislaw Lem is pretty great imo.

That said, most of my favorite science-fi stories are in the form of short stories. Ray Bradbury's ""Martian Chronicles"" and ""The Illustrated Man"" are both classics. Harlan Ellison's ""Shatterday"" is another good one. Any collection of short stories by Asimov or Clarke are good choices too.

&#x200B;

I think the form of the short story allows writers to explore a theme or concept without having to build a 300 page long narrative around it, and this helps them focus on higher concepts without having to worry too much about fully realizing characters or subplots, or settings, or whatever."
