* The Audible DRM was broken years ago.

15553,best tree for the garden,I suggest you look into making a [food forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_gardening). It'll take a few years to get it going but once you do you'll be growing a lot of food for a long time. Money saved on your food costs for years adds up to a lot and you could definitely sell/give away extra from 20-30 acres. You could just start with 5 and keep growing.

72484,best keyboard switches,"I, too, am a Brown key proponent.  I do a lot of typing in addition to gaming; I found Reds to be too soft for typing purposes and Blues to be much too stiff for gaming.  Browns are just right.

But it's up to you.  If possible, get some sample keys and test for yourself.  If you do any amount of typing, I personally wouldn't recommend Red switches, and if you do go that route I'd recommend having a dedicated typing keyboard on the side."
