BUT OMG CHECK THIS https://www.audiobookx.com/

This site goes free to download very rarely and it just so happens that today it is free.  To download from them, right click and inspect element on a web page then copy the link for whatever book you want and paste it to the page, then download it like that.

but ya, pm later about DC++, DC++ is where you want to go for audiobooks, it's a place called dawghouse where people with terabytes of audiobooks all share with each other.

DC++ is 10x better than audiobookbay...and if you want to pay for audiobookx, i think it's a subscription based thing you can do that...or you can wait till it's free and download everything they have like I do hahaha.",best place to pirate audiobooks reddit

64187,"By default, any PDF you get from Archive.org can only be opened using Adobe Digital Editions for a short space of time (1 hour or 14 days, depending on the book). This limitation is called ""Digital Rights Management"" (DRM), because it allegedly protects the rights of (long dead) authors and (fat cat rich) publishers to stop you from reading their books without paying.

If you're on r/Piracy, then you're here to bypass DRM. You should already know what it is.

As for bookmarklets, you know how you can right-click on your bookmarks bar and select ""Create Bookmark""? Instead of putting a website address, you can put a bit of javascript (similar to what I posted above) and save it. Clicking on this special bookmark will run the script on your current webpage.",best place to pirate audiobooks reddit
