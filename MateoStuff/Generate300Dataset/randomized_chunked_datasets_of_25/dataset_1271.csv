64994,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Born n' bred Barbarian from the west-side/Mesa so I'm a little biased toward my half: 

Cheap Mexican: El Zarape and Super Cucas are both cheap and great. El Zarape also offers a bit more variety if you're adventurous. Super Ricas is good, but there is a ton of hype around it thanks to Julia Childs (her recommendation was totally overblown). You can always expect a large crowd of tourists and locals at Super Ricas, but the previous joints pretty much only cater to locals. 

Asian food: You're SOL for the most part. No place is down right awful, but don't expect super high-quality, super accurate food. Sushi-Teri on Bath and Szechuan on Cliff come to mind."

38361,best newspapers to read,"[STRATFOR](https://www.stratfor.com/) is a private intelligence firm which employs former spooks to provide clients with general and bespoke intel on whatever topic they want.

CLASS is the standard NATO term for 'Classified' ie - only available to people who have been vetted to see it. There are levels of classification from RESTRICTED - Government policy and such, to TOP SECRET POSITIVE CODEWORD which means that only a few people in the world have access to that information. This is real-life briefcase chained to your wrist stuff."

Cover your mouth when your cough (preferably with your arm - if you use a hand make sure you wash well), and don't use your mouth in surgery."

61874,Best RPG game on PS4,"I don't know how it's possible for a human being to not consider *The Witcher 3* an RPG. It's unarguably an RPG. This isn't even up for debate. It's one of the most RPG games to ever RPG.

Just stop with this cancer already."

3694,best college for research,"It's a tough thing to visualise, if you think about it.

Sure, there are problems with this current viz, as you stated, but I can't think of any other method to present this data in a way which retains its realism.

Sure, you could do some kind ""top 1000 universities as a proportion of population"", or some kind of hexagonal grid like ""top 1000 universities per n km"", or give each orange dot its own space so that none overlap...

...but I think it would become completely abstracted to the point of unreadability.

In truth, it's the 'fault' of reality that the top 1000 universities *just are* in the most developed urban centers, not the fault of this viz."

12837,best gifts for mom,"When I was a teen, my mom once got off the phone with my older sister and told me, ""It seems like she only calls when she needs something."" 

That stuck with me and now I always call up just to chat. I haven't ""needed"" help from them in decades."
6393,best Netflix documentary,"One of my favorites recently is [Bathtubs Over Broadway](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6029778/) about the world of industrial musicals.

Maybe because some of the songs/products are so odd, or because the ""main character"" was a comedy writer for David Letterman, I spent the first half convinced it was all a windup.  A very interesting topic/piece of Americana I knew nothing about before watching and left really appreciating everyone involved.  It's on Netflix too I believe."
