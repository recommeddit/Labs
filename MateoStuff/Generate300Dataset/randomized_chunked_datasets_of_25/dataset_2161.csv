59559,best perfume,"> I don't know a few of these, but judging by the ones I am familiar with, you have fantastic taste! I'm guessing a late-20s to late-30s guy who likes a good strong drink (perhaps a whiskey or brandy) and has a penchant for opulence, contemplation, and leisure. Do you perhaps live in a cooler climate? I ask because many of these are quite warm, smoky, and amber-heavy. You seem like a Taurus, lol. Definitely somebody who's interesting to talk to.

Thanks! I'm 28. I really do like whiskey, but I don't drink it since I have a feeling I won't stop. I lived in Siberia for 7 years, that's why I tend to wear such fragrances. I'm a Cancer and definitely try to keep my interests in wide range to have an ability to support almost any conversation. üòÅ Pretty spot-on üëè"

32141,best hotel to live in,"I stayed at a beautiful mountain resort north of Guilin in China. We were on the river and it was so beautiful. We got massages and had beers and peanuts on the patio, and it was the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever visited."

46425,best trick or treating candy,"When I was 14 me and my friends went to a house that was kind of set back from the other houses at the end of this crescent.  This dude answered the door and he was surprised that anyone showed up at all.  He and some friends were playing poker, and they had no candy so they gave us each a can of beer.

We drank the beer, then went back and knocked again.  They gave us each another beer.  The third time they said no."

72059,best movies with a cool twist,"It seemed like every horror movie around this time was going for a crazy twist ending, so when I saw it in the theater I turned to my friend and jokingly said he was the killer when it showed him in the hospital bed. 

The looks on our faces when he turned out to be the killer was priceless."
5997,best programming language for web development,"> PHP would be better than Python, in pure employability terms.

I know a couple shops in Denver that really are willing to pay top dollar for people that really know python / django inside and out.  So I guess that is anecdotal, but its my impression."
57626,best cologne,"I can help!

Margeiella Replica has some great scents - Fireplace is one of my daily scents. It‚Äôs very sweet and Smokey. It‚Äôs genderless, but male dominant. Jazz Club is definitely date night material and it sticks to you which is cool. I have two more Margellas but I just got them and don‚Äôt know them that well. One is basically coconut and smells like tanning oil, and one is tanning oil and oud. They‚Äôre interesting but I‚Äôm not in love with either one, pretty much a summer wedding day and summer wedding night occasion. Maybe some beach days or workouts with a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù.

Tom Ford is the next brand I wear a lot of. The regular and extreme noir are both great but the showstopper is the oud wood. It‚Äôs basically male pheromones and sophistication in a bottle. It‚Äôs definitely strong and overpowers you while you‚Äôre getting ready, but it‚Äôll fade on your way to a spot, and then stick. Don‚Äôt worry too much about that initial strong smell. They have a new one Tobacco Vanilla, which isn‚Äôt like a Home Goods candle, it legit smells like a sweet Cuban and freshly ground up vanilla paste.

I also like YSL - they have two scents, I think just called L‚ÄôHomme and the L‚ÄôHomme intense. The regular one is like a summer or spring scent you can go nuts and it won‚Äôt overpower anyone. The intense is definitely an evening scent but nothing crazy, just a nice spice and cinnamon hint.


Another couple honorable mentions are Ralph Loren Oud and Ralph Loren Leather. Both dark and heavy but good. 

To be honest tho, go with a friend with a good nose and try a few of these out. Your skin will react to them differently. I actually get a bit itchy with a few of mine and have to careful where to spray. My neck is pretty sensitive and I have to do shoulders, back of the head, and chest instead sometimes. 

I‚Äôm not a baller, my wife just works at L‚ÄôOreal and she gets a free bottle basically every other month or we can buy em for 60% off any time.  She picks them out (except for the Tom Ford, that‚Äôs just me). 

My favorite smells are scotch, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, wood, coconut, raisins, and leather. I don‚Äôt like herbal, floral scents. I have a pretty shit nose."

33784,best electric car,"Modifications can address issues. But in the greater pictures with all those issues, imo it is more of a one trick pony for drag racing in Mountain View. One issue I missed is the standard 4 piston Brembo in the front. Those will definitely need to be upgraded. It also loses 10-20% torque between 15-60% charge.

Software is not going to help the inadequate cooling, when it is already beyond the limits with cooling system running at 100% in track mode. The problem is that there is no way to address this. It's a closed system that is integrated with their software. 2-3 seconds on a 1.5 mile track in cool weather brings the performance closer to a $35k hot hatch (assuming 100% charge). Include the torque vs. charge issue, and it will maybe get passed by similar skill drivers in BRZ by end of session."
