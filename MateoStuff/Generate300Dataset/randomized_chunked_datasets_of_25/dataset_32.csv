We grew up in the country and my father was as much a child as we were.  He lead us to the point of death and my mother would pull us back just in time before we died.  Each year, we all pick different childhood stories and draw them as a card.  He has an entire collection now.  Broken bones, rocks to the forehead, attempted parasailing behind the truck, broken bones, fires, stitches, blood, ramps, explosions, wild animals, sword fights, tree houses, more broken bones, fights, disaster, sledding down the stairs, mud fights, cow poop fights, broken bones, concussions, casts, braces, flying machines, sledding to school behind the truck... and broken bones.  To name a few of the cards that have been illustrated to date.",best gifts for dad
