68902,best science fiction novel,"It’s sort of hard to explain briefly, but it was a major controversy around the Hugo Awards a while ago. If you google ‘sad puppies’ and ‘Hugo Awards’ you should be able to find more! 

The tl;dr is that a bunch of white men got really pissy that an increased number of women and BIPOC authors were being nominated, so they tried to brigade the awards with votes for white men (and a select few white women)."

46749,best hand santizer brand,"Thanks for posting this. I was curious about a bottle I purchased at Costco a few weeks ago and sure enough, it's one of the ones on the list. It's actually the latest item on their recall roster. So, it doesn't just have to be a dollar store purchase.  They didn't have GermX or Purell the last time I was there but there were some other options (didn't check what they were since I thought I was good with the one I now need to return.) I had heard about the methanol situation but hadn't seen an actual list of products until your post."

11814,best gifts for dad,"I have four brothers.  We have done the same thing our entire lives for our dad on Father's Day.  We all hand draw him a card.  We grew up in the country and my father was as much a child as we were.  He lead us to the point of death and my mother would pull us back just in time before we died.  Each year, we all pick different childhood stories and draw them as a card.  He has an entire collection now.  Broken bones, rocks to the forehead, attempted parasailing behind the truck, broken bones, fires, stitches, blood, ramps, explosions, wild animals, sword fights, tree houses, more broken bones, fights, disaster, sledding down the stairs, mud fights, cow poop fights, broken bones, concussions, casts, braces, flying machines, sledding to school behind the truck... and broken bones.  To name a few of the cards that have been illustrated to date."
