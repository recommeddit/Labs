72682,best wireless lightweight mouse,"Interesting. I just hesitate to recommend the XM1 for a palm grip because it’s so low profile. The hump isn’t very big but it is a bit closer to the back of the mouse. It is a great mouse but my recommendation would be to hybrid grip at a medium hand size, not sure if that’s what you’re looking for"
61780,Best RPG game on PS4,"Yeah, you just press L1 to switch it on or off. You can change in the options whether you want to go with 2x or 4x (I've done 2x and it helps so much)."
45570,best gaming system,Just bought it for the switch. I know it's different than scoring it for pennies. But I'm just so excited to play it again. The wife is having difficulty getting the controls down. But it's fun.

32200,best hotel to live in,"My husband worked at several luxury hotels and residences (rich people who live at the hotels) and besides how absolutely disgusting everything inside the rooms actually is...I was most shocked by the behavior of the ultra rich. 

I’m not talking businessmen and doctors. I’m talking Saudi Princes and Heirs to Dynasty families. The level of comfort and technology these people have come to expect is things we cannot imagine. 

“What do you mean there isn’t there access to intercoms next to the bathroom for when I need services while going potty?” “The television inside the shower is only a 40 inch and there is no gold in this room I need a better suite”. “I’m gonna need you to go out, buy me better bedding, remake my bed, and then do it again tomorrow because I won’t sleep on the same bedding twice”. 

And that’s just the tip of the icebergs."

10301,best suitcase lock,"A plastic case with two giant padlocks on it would be the kind of luggage that would get ""lost"" somewhere mysteriously because it looks like it has some super expensive shit inside of it."
56856,best desktop monitor,"I've been throwing up between the Dell S2721QS vs BenQ EW2780U for a display to go with my 2020 M1 Macbook Air. They come out to a really similar price at the moment (\~$500 AUD), as both are on sale. I want a multi-purpose monitor mostly for uni work (I study software engineering), but also watching TV and some light gaming (games like stardew valley). I might also hook my switch up to it."
41164,best instrument to play,"Am violist, someone kick my autotuned woodchipper out before I tell you it's accurate"
72321,best keyboard switches,"Holy pandas and Zealios are the two popular options right now,  but really it all is preference.  If you can,  go to a local meet so you can try other people's builds. It is absolutely worth it, and if you can't manage that, it is absolutely worth spending a bit of cash on a sample pack or tester of switches. These are both much better options than dropping cash on a whole board that you ultimately may not be happy with. Take your time and have fun exploring the options."

10198,best pencil for drawing,"I'd avoid the Copic markers for now. Perfect your drawing and understanding of color theory, and then worry about fancy tools. I've never found markers to be user-friendly, and they feel limiting, especially because you don't have much freedom with color. 

I *am* a huge fan, though, of coloring pen and pencil drawings with watercolor. There's plenty of [fancy](http://www.dickblick.com/products/sakura-koi-watercolor-sketch-box-travel-pan-sets/) travel-[kits](http://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Watercolor-Field/dp/B000N9B3WM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1325877163&sr=8-1) of [various](http://www.amazon.com/Winsor-amp-Newton-Cotman-Colour/dp/B001GWJ2XM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1325877163&sr=8-5) sizes [as well](http://www.dickblick.com/products/blockx-watercolors-half-pan-travel-sets/), and [waterbrushes](http://www.dickblick.com/products/niji-waterbrush/) work surprisingly well though you should get comfortable with using a regular brush first.

6886,best iPhone,"You’re correct, perhaps I should have specified that it’s the first device that can use “Hey Siri” wirelessly. But as far as I’m concerned, that makes it the first device with “Hey Siri” because phones are meant to be wireless. I only have my phone plugged in when I’m going to bed or if I’ve run out of battery. The vast majority of the time I’m using the phone and the vast majority of the time I need Siri, the phone is not plugged in, so that makes the 6S the first phone with “Hey Siri” functionality that serves a purpose for me."
