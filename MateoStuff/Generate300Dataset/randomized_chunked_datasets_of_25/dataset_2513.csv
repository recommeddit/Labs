11256,best gifts for dad,"I don't know what to tell you. I was fine. I didn't know the cords and hooks were at an additional cost. I didn't ask my sister how much it cost when I borrowed it. I asked at the store at a later date. They apparently left them out. 

This happened  though. Trust me, I have better things to do than make up hammock stories. Maybe the temp on my phone was way off. Who knows."

First one I've played more than an hour or two of since MW 2012 (and I really didn't like that one either) after loving the Undergrounds / MW 2005 / Carbon, and after muting the music to play my own instead it was easily the most fun classic Black Box NFS feeling since IMO."

16783,best pet for toddlers,"FYI the nanny dog thing actually came from a 1971 [New York Times article](https://mobile.nytimes.com/1971/09/19/archives/a-breed-that-came-up-the-hard-way.html) no one has found an instance of it being used before then. It was a term coined by the editor of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of the United States newsletter. It was largely an attempt at rebranding the image of the dog. So the bully breeds being called nanny dogs is a myth; not to say they can’t be good with children, but they’ve never been historically called nanny dogs."
66773,best soccer team in the world,"Could argue being injured should lessen his value, tbf. Hard to say what he'll be like when back fit, and whether it'll have affected his prospects and fitness long term. Adds a slight 'unknown quantity' aspect to the rest of his career, which you could argue should take some of his value off. We know that very promising younger players in the past have had careers derailed by serious injuries like Gomez suffered. Although of course plenty have recovered and gone on to have brilliant careers too - but it does remain a risk."

41715,movies like Inception,"David and Brandon Cronenberg sci-fi catalog is worth visiting. Antiviral is great, so is possessor which someone mentioned earlier. Existenz was mentioned which is super mine bendy. Videodrome and scanners are great, so is the Fly. All sci fi laced with poetic philosophical ideas, similar to inception in spirit IMO."
