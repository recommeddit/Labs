24847,best spiderman actor,"You will like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ty87ZpGN00).  They agree completely with you.

But Tobey Maguire brought him from cartoon to reality better than anyone else for the first time.  He had the biggest challenge.  And everyone after that, just had to match him."

FTFY"
39990,best Chrome extensions,"I heard something called The Great Suspender is also good since it's supposed to kinda freeze and out put tabs not in use to sleep or something. I haven't used it myself personally, but I've heard a lot of good things about it and that it can be value with how much RAM chrome can eat up... Especially with adding tons of other extensions as listed above"

44753,best items under $100,"Think this is a bit over $100 but a PC Optimum Insiders subscription. 

Basically switching to online grocery for 75% of my shopping has saved me sooo much time. The shopping experience isn’t always perfect but the time it saves me makes up for it. The key is to use it at No Frills so that you don’t have to wait for them to bring it out to your car. 

If you shop even once a week, the free pickup and amount of points you get back more than makes up for the membership fee."
30040,best money managing app,"From your replies it seems you are making an app? Please do share it here when it's already available.

PS. A lot of us here love spreadsheets as you can see,  so biggest dealbreaker would be if the data cannot be exported (for free). For me I only want an app for recording expenses on the go, and to filter previous records easily (the only real con of spreadsheets is that they are unwieldy and look ugly on mobile)."
17752,best Kardashian,"Khloe has a lot of issues but I would say it’s her. I think she knows how to respect people, from all walks of life. I think she comes off a lot less classist than Kim and Kourtney do & she empathises better than the rest of them. 

A lot of her character flaws don’t come from a moral aspect imo, more of a lack of self love. She doesn’t get it right all the time of course, but who does?"
