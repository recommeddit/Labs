"I went to a friend's wedding at Beaches, Turks & Caicos. The food was good, the staff were friendly and the beach was the most beautiful I've ever seen. It was a September wedding and the resort was practically empty because it was hurricane season. No lines for food, drinks, water sports, nothing. It was really great. By far the best wedding I've ever been to."
"Emailing (politely) to the ""corresponding author"", asking for an electronic reprint, is also a very good strategy to get a copy of a paper behind a paywall."
It's marketed as hackers distro. It also get boost after the release of Mr Robot
"Hah, took the words out of my mouth! Yeah, if I can find a free option that will save me at least a bit of money."
Was anyone else super pissed once they clicked all the way to #1 and it was AC/DC? Threw up in my mouth.

"I had a North Face jacket before I bought my Canada Goose and the Canada Goose is noticeably warmer. I don't need to layer like I did with my North Face. 

But I live in Edmonton where it actually gets cold. When I see people walking around Vancouver in a Canada Goose when it's +12, yeah I agree it's just for show and a status symbol."

I've recently been wanting to get into solo board games and lock picking... So that stuff would be cool.

"I've had fakes in the past, and I'll say my real Wayfarers have fared (lulz) really well over the last 6 years.  I'm a putz, and rarely use the case, and I have a kid and bend down and rough-house with her all the time, and they fall on the ground, a LOT.  I'm at 6 years, and the lenses are finally completely shot, and the frame is too banged up to warrant just replacing the lenses (like $22/ea, I think). 

I'm likely going to buy replacement Wayfarers, and some Persol whatevers, to be a bit fancier.  I have some Ray Ban Aviator, oversized (which are still small on my giant head/face), and I don't like them.  I need to be able to prop the glasses on top of my head, since my life consists of running errands and having my hands full, at all times :S"
"I was using a pair of Sennheiser PC 360's and it's like being hugged around the heady by a teddy bear.  Recently picked up a pair of Audiotechnica ATH-M70x's and that's more like a leather pillow on each ear.  The Grado's stock foam cushions were too abrasive, and if it was humid at all my ears just became a swamp.  That'll probably be true of the M70x's, too, but they're still easier on the ears overall.  (Better sound, too, but also like 4x more expensive than Grados)"
"I enjoyed Marina Bay Sands, Singapore a lot."
"No other spreadsheet software is equal to Excel for Windows. I'm a Mac-using CPA so I'd love to be proven wrong, but in my experience the only thing that comes close is Excel for Mac, and as you've found it is not quite the same as Excel for Windows. I have Windows installed on my MBP via Boot Camp solely for gaming and Excel. That may not be the most elegant solution but it's the only approach that I can recommend for your needs."
"Any of the Bad Boys movies

Any MCU but I favor The Winter Soldier

Mission Impossible 3 was pretty good"
I wonder if German Charlie Chaplin would have enjoyed cricket.

"Yeah, I agree with you completely, it's a really common fallacy too."
"Go to your local municipal airport and ask if they have instructors that do that sort of thing. its very fun, and I would absolutely recommend it."
