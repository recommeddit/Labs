35417,"Mojitos are great - especially when it’s hot out. The proportions of everything can adjusted based on personal taste - but here’s mine:

2oz white rum
.75-1oz simple syrup
Juice of half a lime
2-3 large mint leaves (try different kinds!)

Combine in a tall glass and use a muddler to chew up the mint. If you don’t have one, just toss a few ice cubes in a shaker and shake the hell out of it.

Top with club soda and lots of ice. 

I’ve recently tried the unsweetened ‘natural’ soda water (lime flavored) with decent results when I didn’t have fresh limes, or was too lazy to squeeze them. Fresh mint leaves are a must, however. I’ve also made simple syrup with baking Splenda - it tastes great, but just doesn’t add the same body that regular sugar does.",best alcoholic drink

54839,"While I agree with you with respect to carbon adsorption, I feel it is relevant to note that with minor changes in water chemistry and constituents (pH, silica, zirconium), the adsorption preferences of granulated activated carbon change significantly. For things like arsenic, which are non-acute contaminants (generally speaking in drinking water), it would be unlikely based on ion-selectivity of the carbon that you would have any effective removal. [Adedge](http://www.adedgetechnologies.com/technology/overview.htm) has a great amount of research concerning arsenic and uranium removal. Their media is a granular ferric hydroxide and the page describes common interactions with ions which decrease efficacy of adsorbtive media. If you really want in depth and highly technical answers, see [this](http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P1009FDL.PDF) EPA study.

Now, if you are dealing with acute inorganic and non-biotic contaminants such as nitrate (infants are especially vulnerable), there will be little to no removal given the nature of the molecule. If you are on a private well and are on septic, have your well tested for nitrate and coliform bacteria annually or more frequently. FYI 40 CFR 141.23, 24 and 26 is the safe drinking water act maximum contaminant levels of inorganic, organic, and radionuclide contaminants. 10mg/L is the nitrate MCL and water above this level is considered a very high risk to public health and generally considered non-potable (in the US). 

Where the OP may have some success with a brita filter would be with turbidity and total dissolved solids. As nopropulsion noted, cryptosporidium, giradia and other microscopic nasties are harbored by turbidity and TDS. While it would be unlikely that you would have total removal, it would be synergistic to filter and then try for microbial inactivation with chlorine. Essentially, you are removing protective environments for the microbes and allowing for more contact time for chlorine with microbes rather than organic matter. This would be assuming you are starting with non potable water.

Ultimately, activated carbon is typically geared for aesthetic improvement. Removing halogenated organic compounds and chloramines, which are compounds that form in chlorinated water, is the typical mission of a brita filter. Taste and odor improvement yes, health issues, probably not.

Additionally, for chlorine odor issues, call your water provider and ask them if they are currently meeting proper [chlorination breakpoint](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=breakpoint+chlorination&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1680&bih=935&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=umZr92Ir4Z1TJM:&imgrefurl=http://www.cee.vt.edu/ewr/environmental/teach/wtprimer/chlorine/chlorine.html&docid=eK-wv8AqT-BG2M&imgurl=http://www.cee.vt.edu/ewr/environmental/teach/wtprimer/chlorine/zones.gif&w=947&h=690&ei=YcHmTsfcBbKGiQLXhNj9Bg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=873&vpy=159&dur=304&hovh=133&hovw=183&tx=177&ty=79&sig=102303205236723783424&page=1&tbnh=131&tbnw=180&start=0&ndsp=41&ved=1t:429,r:4,s:0).
