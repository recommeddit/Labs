30172,best Mexican war to study,"yeah I think 6th was World History, 7th was Texas, and 8th was American. I can't remember high school, but I'm 100% sure I had AP American History in 11th or 12th grade. Eurpean History was an elective in high school (we were on a schedule very much like universities: a class was a semester long and an hour and a half-ish. So you did 4 classes a semester, and it was theoretically possible to take 8 courses in sequence. I did Algebra 2 -> Geometry -> Trig -> Pre-Calc -> Calc AB -> Calc BC in three years and my senior year didn't take any math at all. Then, after a year-long break, I majored in math and remarkably remembered it all :)"

10884,best suitcase lock,"There's a talk by a guy who flys with firearms in his checked luggage for the simple fact that it is handled more securely.  You're pulled to the side from the checked luggage line, it has to be checked in front of you and then locked, and is not allowed to be unlocked until it's back in your possession at the destination terminal.

36733,best alcoholic drink,"Yep, gotta be careful with those cheap mixed drinks, this is where knowing your liquors comes in handy. If they don’t list them on the menu, ask. If they’re selling the drink for $3, imagine how cheap it was to make."
1575,best ice cream flavor,Haha woah man - that place looks crazy. I would so go there with you.
22149,best celebrity,"To be honest, yeah, I kind of do. We had a lot of celebrities come through the hotel and many of them were incredibly self-absorbed. Some were pretty cool, but JT was the only one that ever tried to hang out with the ""little people"".
EDIT: I took you totally out of context. Sorry."

31566,best hotel to live in,"Found this thread a bit late. Four seasons HK has amazing service, but it's getting slightly tired. St. Regis in a slightly worse location, but it's a beautiful modern hotel. I've switched."
23978,best anime,"Basing this on fun-to-watch factor more than complexity or anything:

1) Attack on Titan - probably best all rounder for gripping plot, action, etc.

2) Shokugeki no Soma - definitely most pure fun, never thought cooking could be this intense.

3) Kuroko's Basketball - bias bc of my own basketball background, similar intensity to Soma.

4) Jojo's Bizzare Adventure (minus the first 10 episodes) - tried watching 3 times and stopped at episode 4-5. Finally decided to get thru them a month ago, best decision ever.

5) Dr Stone - love it 10 billion percent.

6) Mob Psycho - love it ??? percent.

7) Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood - 2nd place all rounder after AoT

8) Death Note - should be everyone's first anime

9) Vinland Saga - character development and dialogue off the charts

10) Parasyte - extremely interesting character development"

1932,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"I could throw a stone from my house and break a back window at Patxis, so there is some convenience bias,  but we like it a lot . We order once a month on average.  I always pop the pie in the oven set to 500 for a few minutes, on a wire rack over a sheet pan to crisp it up.   Only ever had thin and usually get the Salsicia (sic?)"

16685,best pet for toddlers,"IANAL but I have experience and Feels about this, so...

There are 2 kinds of companion dogs: service dogs, which do trained tasks to mitigate disability, and emotional service animals, which provide emotional support for people with disabilities (usually mental/emotional).  In the US at least, the ADA governs service dog access (or rather, gives disabled people the right to bring service dogs), and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHA) covers reasonable accommodations for ESAs.

ESAs cannot be disallowed by species/breed restrictions -- within reason; an ESA dog can live in no-dog areas, but an ESA blue whale is kind of implausible -- and cannot be charged pet fees in advance.  (But property owners can charge for actual damage, and can take action if an ESA is vicious, threatening, loud/disruptive, or otherwise behaves inappropriately.)

It's important to distinguish between service animals and ESAs, although both are permitted in housing -- and you (general you, meaning people owning an ESA) should have a letter from a doctor/psychiatrist ""prescribing"" the ESA, especially for non-visible disabilities.  (The letter must state that the animal’s handler has a disability identified in the DSM V, and that the animal helps mitigate specific symptoms of this disability. It doesn't need to go into specifics about the diagnosis or specific symptoms.)"

65245,best phone service company,"hi Stetson, this is great! Looks like I will need to spend quite a bit of time looking this over.

Perhaps you are familiar with Howard B’s site at [https://prepaidcompare.net](https://prepaidcompare.net/) ? I found that a while back, and find it quite easy to sort thru the plans there. I haven’t used Airtable before, seems powerful but harder to use the user interface. I’ll work on it.

I’ve been using MVNO’s since 2011. Finally bought a flagship phone (iPhone 12 Mini) and am trying to find better service for it. Lately I had been using Teltik, but they seemed to have a bit of a meltdown.

My quest is to find some combination of service(s) that will give me a working phone whenever there is some kind of signal. (I spend a lot of time out in the woods in northern Michigan) So I’m trying to cover the big 3 carriers. Then I ran across the concept of “domestic roaming” on [prepaidcompare.net](http://prepaidcompare.net/) and am trying to find out the techical details on that.

As an example, I currently have Visible, that seems to cover me for Verizon. I saw that Ting offered T Mobile service, and maybe also roams onto something? Or ATT Prepaid has an annual plan that includes roaming, but haven’t been able to find what it roams onto?

Anyway, your research and sites seem very valuable. Thank you!"
