"The ""B's"" work for the ""C's"" and the ""A's"" teach --- 30 years working and this is the rule, live by it, and adapt to it. The theory is the ""C's"" will take risks, start companies, the ""B"" is too hesitant and will end up working fo the ""C"" -- the ""A"" will stay in Academia since it worked so well for them and thereby have no other option. Trust me on this, either accept your fate or figure out some loophole, otherwise you will just suffer. This is ""The Google Problem"" right now, they higher all ""A's"" (I've interviewed twice there) and they keep making things that are good on paper,  but have no appeal to the real market. This is because they have the ""A's"" in charge and need to reorganize. Long-term: they won't figure this out, will keep making ""Google Wave"" type products (look at the recent Google laptop), and will continue to dilute the brand until they are HP."
What’s nice about MCU movies that they REALLY stick to a strict three-act structure. So you can put any of them on for 40 minutes at a time and sort of get a nice little dose of MCU: The TV Show

"Well I’m not an expert but from a quick (20ish minute) research before buying mine for the PCT I found a 13,000 battery bank that was advertised as the same weight and size of a 10,000. So I bought that one instead. My friend has an older 10,000 and mine is defiantly lighter but a few ounces but again, his is much older. He couldn’t  remember when he bought it. But as far as on trail, I seen a lot that looked just like mine so I put some stickers on mine (I know, not UL) but that way I could tell mine apart from others. I suggest a wall plug in with at least 2 ports"

* Monogatari Series - Romance, Supernatural, Mystery - This is my all time favourite anime series. It currently has five instalments, being [Bakemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari) > [Nisemonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11597/Nisemonogatari) > [Nekomonogatari: Kuro](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15689/Nekomonogatari:_Kuro) > [Monogatari Series: Second Season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17074/Monogatari_Series:_Second_Season) > [Hanamonogatari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21855/Hanamonogatari), in that order.

  The series will seem very strange at first, as the animation style is very unique. However, after a few episodes you will become used to it and welcome it with open arms. 

  The main selling point for this anime series is the characters. Every character is well-written and likeable, and they are also some of the most unique characters I've seen. The story and romance subplot are also very good. 

  This anime may not be everyone's cup of tea, though, as it is heavily focused around dialogue, and most of the time spent is listening to the conversations between characters or narration. 

* [Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note) -  Mystery, Psychological, Thriller - Death Note is a very interesting anime. It forces the watcher to overcome the moral dilemma presented in the show to decide how they will enjoy it. If one sides with the main character, they are able to root for him and enjoy his actions, but on the other side of the spectrum, those who do not side with the main character are still able to enjoy it just as much because of the long lasting suspense and intensity of the story. 

  The characters in this anime are absolutely amazing, and are incredibly well made. There is one thing to note, however, which is that it is widely perceived to drop in quality after the first arc ends. While I somewhat agree with that statement, it is up for you to decide, as it is still rather good.

* [Code Geass](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) (And [Code Geass Season 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2904/Code_Geass:_Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_R2)) - Super Power, Mecha, Action, Drama, Psychological - The main character in this anime is suddenly given a very strange yet incredibly useful power, and decides to use it for good, or rather his perception of good. It is similar to Death Note in the sense that the watcher will either agree with the main characters actions, or disagree with them. 

  This is yet another anime where the characters and story are the incredible. You will feel all kinds of emotions when you watch this anime and you not be able to tell right from wrong at some points. It also has potentially one of the greatest, if not the greatest, ending to an anime that I will ever see.

* [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2) - Romance, Drama, Music, Slice of Life - White Album 2 has no correlation with White Album. You do not need to watch the first to be able to understand the second.

  White Album 2 is an anime that will seem like a typical slice of life anime but with somewhat interesting characters. It denounces that thought throughout the series, and becomes one of the most unique romance stories with fantastic characters I've seen. 

  This anime will probably leave you with mixed feelings towards the end. The characters that you like may end up doing something that you'll question and make you wonder if they really are the character you liked.


*  [Mirai Nikki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/Mirai_Nikki_\(TV\)) - Mystery, Psychological, Thriller - The story to Mirai Nikki is outstanding. The plot is interesting right from the start, and only seems to increase in intensity it as the episodes continue. The main character is constantly placed in difficult situations where time is limited, and sometimes you will hate him for the decisions he makes. 

  While I don't particularly think that most of the main cast in this anime are all that great, the ones that are, are ridiculously good. You may not like some of them, but they are written amazingly well.

* [Clannad](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad) and [Clannad: After Story](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4181/Clannad:_After_Story) - Drama, Romance, Slice of Life, Comedy - If there is one romance anime that you watch, it has to be this one. The art style will probably turn you away at first, but I urge you to stick around for the story and characters.

  In order to truly understand this anime and get the best out of this anime, you will need to watch Clannad before After Story, even though you can get away with watching only After Story.

  Clannad starts off as a normal school-set slice of life, with some quite good comedy here and there, but this part of the series is here to let you get used to the characters, and set up the story for Clannad: After Story. However, it is still rather emotional at some points.

  Clannad: After Story continues the story from Clannad, and while the story for this one wont be as comedic as the previous instalment, it is still somewhat funny. However, it will build up your emotions for the main characters and then thoroughly rip your heart out numerous times. Some people say they did not cry while watching this anime, and they are either liars or they have no heart.


This list wasn't in any order, and I'm not even sure why I made such long descriptions for each one, but take a gander if you want. I've probably sewn some bullshit in there, so send me a comment if you think anything's a bit iffy."

"1. Maguire
2. Holland, the quirky bull shit talking while he fights is one of my favorite aspects of comic Spidey and the MCU-Spidey does just that.
3. Maguire
4. Garfield
5. Maguire. Alone for JJJ, but it had the best Aunt May and the friendship and rivalry between Peter and Harry was great
6. I don't know. Have the feeling all three of them do act better in other roles to be honest. Especially Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but I never liked his Spidey-perfomance...
7. Garfield, helped Gwen was played by Emma Stone who has great chemistry with Garfield. And I like they modernized comic Gwen and gave her some personality of MJ (especially as this Gwen knew Peter was Spidey from the begin of their relationship)
8. Maguire, no doubt
9. Maguire (Spider-Man: No More in Spider-Man 2)
10. Maguire
11. Would say Holland. He's more young looking and seems more likely to be a high schooler than the other ones and has this nerdy touch. Maguire's Peter was written better, but I think Holland looks more the part. And he just loves playing Spidey.

Bonus by me, adding two points:
- costume: Garfield, the one of ASM 2 just looks amazing (don't like the first one...)
- villains: Maguire, by far. Vulture and Mysterio were great, but can't match Willem Dafoes Green Goblin. Doc Ock was cool too, while I think he wasn't as great as the comic book version (would like to see a more diabolic Doc Ock in the future). Garfield's villains were the worst in my eyes."

"Yeah, my family had an unbroken chain of 3 sons for kids, going back 4 generations. I didn't even pick any girl names out. Now my older brother and I both have beautiful baby girls......

For kid #2, I now won't pick out any boy names and am calling it a she.

Edit: ALso yes, my little brother did indeed shout ""Combo Breaker"" at the birth of the first daughter."

"I find that the best way to calculate is usually by the total battery then round up to the nearest 5K or so. If you have about 3700mah battery and have 2 off them, I'd try to find 10K battery or so. Those batteries are about the same weight, and there are some that has solar charging. It'll be painfully slow, but if you'd be outdoor, it'll help if you hook it to your backpack.  


EDIT 10KmAh should weigh about half a can of soda."

"Sweat it out. Not sure why, but it works for me every time. I put on multiple layers. Beanie, t-shirt, shorts, and thick socks. Then a thick hoodie and sweatpants. Then a heavy winter coat also with a hood. Crank up the heat. Then a heavy blanket. Wrap myself up like a burrito. And for good measure, like others have said, whiskey. Something about significantly raising my core temperature and having whiskey flowing through my veins makes my body a very inhospitable place for the virus. The next day, the worst I have is maybe a slightly runny nose."
