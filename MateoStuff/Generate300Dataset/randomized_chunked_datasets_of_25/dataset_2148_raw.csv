"Idk the way I see it in terms of preteige (with no experience whatsoever lmao) is Columbia, UPenn, brown but I think thatâ€™s also cause Columbia and UPenn are in bigger cities and because of that just have more opportunities in general"

"I suspect the intent of the OP was that center = politically neutral and unslanted in their coverage, which at least implies freedom from bias even if not complete accuracy.

Edit:  Nevermind, OP explicitly says in another post that neutral is not the intent.  My bad.  o_O"
"I didn't say any?  I'm sorry, but a touchdown when you need a touchdown is more clutch than a kicker when you don't need a touchdown.  It is entirely circumstantial though, and there's no need to get defensive about Brady since no one is saying he is anything other than great.  I just said he was similar to Joe Montana, and simply mentioned a few things that may get glossed over in favor of statistics that are inflated in this day and age.  The salary cap argument is a fallacy because teams like the Redskins, Giants, 85 Bears ect were ridiculously stacked as well.  The 49ers just drafted to perfection the year they won their first Super Bowl and continued to reap the benefits throughout the decade."
"People like to shit on high end glasses for being overpriced, but brands like Oliver Peoples, ic!berlin, Maui Jim, Blackfin, Barton Perreira and Dita all show a noticeable jump in style and quality that is definitely worth considering if you're not a broke hipster like most of this sub."

"People argued that the 11400 was ignored due to 'availability', but that's wrong for two reasons. First its available at MSRP from B&H, BestBuy, and Walmart and below MSRP at Microcenter.

Second, you cant really argue that you shouldnt recommend products based on availability, when reviewers, including Anandtech recommended Zen 3 which was sold out online for months, and certain skus like the 5950x still arent available yet get recommended (not for gaming). Also GPU recommendations make the point moot too, because heres the link for GPU's that are sold by Newegg directly and are in-stock https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?Submit=Property&Subcategory=48&N=100007709%204131%208000&IsPowerSearch=1 Currently you can only buy a $3,000 NVIDIA Tesla M10"

"The only rule I would urge you follow is not to give out home made items. It has to be manufactured and in a wrapper. No cookies, brownies etc,."
"The chances of me buying a $20k item from this board is slim. However, something in me likes being aware of those items. I do wonder if you can talk to a commercial refrigeration outfit. Some of them do custom work."
"But Metro's editorial position is quite different. DMGT don't produce financial breakdowns by title but it's widely believed that Metro is an extremely profitable paper for them. Of course its profits come from advertising which they sell at a high cost due to the fact that Metro's readership tends to be young, urban professionals -- exactly the people who'd generally run a mile from the sort of stuff the Mail puts out. There's no way DMGT want to kill their golden goose so they're not going to use Metro to put forward Mail-type politics.

Of course simple by taking a free copy of Metro each morning you are helping contribute to DMGT's coffers, so if your dislike of that company is strong enough, stop picking up the Metro!"

But emulating Gran Turismo 4 is still the best there is, in my opinion.

Heck I think even some decent PCs can run Gran Turismo 5 without an issue now."
"I bought an Acer K242HLABID 24"" 1080p monitor for ~$160 two years ago. It has a HDMI port, and 2ms response time.

I've bene using it ever since I bought it, and haven't had any problems.

Only con is the stand - if you like to move the monitor often, you'll feel a little paranoid 'cos it seems a bit loose. I don't, so I'm highly satisifed with it."
