I like those too!
"That's not how Transfermarkt works. It's the same value regardless of their contract duration.

Also doubt France has 2 players missing worth a combined €140M."
..what?
"This is true. If what was messing you up was a tweak and you just restore it using Installer or Batchomatic and the tweak was backed up, then itll just show itself again. However, hopefully you can maybe go into safemode with iCleaner and identify and disable the problem tweak :)"
It goes with everything because it's agreeable!

"It says in the manual that you can do that. I tried diluting 5:1 with water, but found 1:1 works great and keeps itself sterile."
Lmfao chill sis i aint getting paid to defend Khloe. It's just my opinion and hardly something that warrants your shady af response.
"Okay, but using a G Master lens on a webcam setup is pretty ridiculous. You'd get identical quality out of a $500 used Tamron lens for the purposes of a webcam. Come on."
Are those lists from best to worst or more or less random?
"I used CollegeBoard's college search thing. While it didn't really help me choose where to apply, it did help me choose my final choice. Fiske's guide is also a good source"

"I have a 75hz ultrawide. Here's an anecdotal opinion:

I play a lot of Siege. Sometimes when I run a Flash game, Siege will get messed up. This causes Siege to run at exactly 2 different speeds:57FPS, and 75FPS. I can tell you without question that I can tell exactly when my game is running at 57FPS. Absolutely infuriating. I've found I can make my game run at 75FPS by alt-tabbing out of Siege and then switching back in. I can also tell you that I've been killed a few times because I've been trying to get that sweet 75FPS back.

In my experience, the difference is extremely noticeable. My friends have noticed it was well."
I love candy corn too.  The best part of being an adult is the ability to do in excess what you loved on rare occasions as a child.
"that’s cool, i’m willing to install installer, very good to hear that."

Check out alpha gaming video on the webcams. He compares a couple cheap ones with the BRIO and c920. I went with the Chinese $40 webcam that looks just as good as the c920
