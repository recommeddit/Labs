23183,best social networking site for CS,"As others have said, LinkedIn is the only one that seems to matter. I do have a Facebook profile, but it's set to private. I haven't *once* had employers/co-workers ask me about any social media besides LinkedIn."

4838,best home improvement store,Home Depot for their customer service. I have had some really bad experiences with Lowes folks.
14741,best romantic novel,"I second all the Alexis Hall recommendations. His writing style is just impeccable 

I also really like Kate Clayborn. Love Lettering has some amazing imagery/scenery."
52797,best hiphop album,"Just different? Fine, I'll accept that, BUT don't call it hip hop. It is NOT hip hop. It is an entirely new genre. They can't even rap. There is no substance to their lyrics, and they obly talk about drugs, sex, money, designer clothes, and cars that cost more than a house. They all use the same old tired triplet rhythm. I grew up in the 90s when rapping about your material wealth became a thing, but the main difference is: they could actually rap, AND they had the decency to call it rap instead of hip hop. They knew it was a new genre altogether."
32127,best hotel to live in,"The Cullen Hotel in Melbourne Australia.

Nothing fancy, and actually really affordable, just a really pretty artsy hotel with the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in to this day. They even sell their mattresses, I was tempted. Still am. Stayed there for a work conference for a few days."

65825,best college in california,"Yeah, my kids are part of the flourishing middle class. Not poor enough to get help, but rich enough to give help to others. Plan is for community college at this point. I've got a few years more to save, but 30-40k a year for a UC is out of the question."
11495,best gifts for dad,Bamboo back scratcher.
16480,best sunglasses for fashion,"I've worked for an eye doctor for almost seven years and sunglasses are my jam! Maui Jim is known for having amazing lens clarity. Stylistically, there's not a huge difference between Ray-Ban and Maui Jim frames. You really can't go wrong with a classic wayfarer or aviator. The trend is definitely moving toward rounder styles, I would imagine that will be in for a while. I wouldn't recommend Oakley in this case, they tend to be very sporty/trendy and look dated sooner than other brands. No matter what you go with, I would suggest trying them on and buying them in a brick and mortar store so you get a great fitting pair and can go back for adjustments. Hold onto your receipts because they usually come with a warranty!"
68691,best science fiction novel,I really liked the entire series of Enders Game! -_-; had to buy them all cause I couldn't put them down and the library did have them.

46804,best hand santizer brand,">Who knows, it might actually support your claim. Why don't you try it?

And if it doesn't support your claim, you can just conveniently forget about it, or fuck with the tests to make them support your claim.

Ah, the miracle of science!"
