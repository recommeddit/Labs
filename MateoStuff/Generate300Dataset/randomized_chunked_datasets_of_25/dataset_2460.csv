45380,best gaming system,"Nintendo Switch! I prefer playing games on handhelds. With how busy I am nowadays, I tend to get a lot more play time out of them when I can just pick it up and play for a bit during my breaks. It’s nice to play from my bed too, when I wake up and right before I sleep. I have yet to actually play my switch docked for single player games."
63636,best books for time management reddit,"4, 5, 6, and Bonus GTD, arguably are the only productivity books up there, everything else is just general self help"
22940,best celebrity,"Hot damn, I'd buy a ticket to every Spielberg movie after that, even if I didn't want to see it."
49093,best gaming monitor,"Man I just got the HP omen 27i and it’s amazing. It’s IPS 165hz and it looks amazing, amazing rgb lights on it that light the back up and bottom and just all in all great response. My new favorite by far"
46185,best trick or treating candy,Peanut butter cups.
23791,best car racing video game,"Project Cars 2. On PS4 it's basically the best for what you're looking for, but lacks a large selection of classics. Gran Turismo Sport exists, and has a better selection of older cars, but PC2 is the best all around game. Honestly, Forza on XB1 is, I think, the best racer this generation, but you were looking for PS4 games"

$15 isn't much and I've been using this model of case for a couple of years.  It's been my favorite."
60442,Best comedy show on Netflix,You’re in for a real Catherine O’Hara treat.
37640,best Marvel movie,"Most people whether or not they’re MCU fans acknowledge that the film is just ok/ typical MCU-fare, which would delegitimize the “overrated” claim, but..

when it came to the initial reactions and eventually awards season, that “overrated” meme got legitimized the moment it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.

A lot of the other awards it was nominated for and actually won were deserved, but BP was lucky enough to have such a massive cultural significance that the Academy didn’t snub it like others in the genre for decades."
36462,best alcoholic drink,i just got heartburn reading that...
23115,best celebrity,"Not a major celebrity or anything but I met Jeff Kinney (author of a Diary of a Wimpy Kid) as he was giving a talk that my school attended. He signed books later and he was really nice and polite. I was slightly embarassed because I had a habit at the time of writing/drawing in my books (basically filled with random scribbles) and he just smiled at me and complimented my poor attempt at sketches. 


 One of my friends admitted to being confused when he knew her name before she remembered that she had written it in her book, thought that was pretty funny as well."

38400,best newspapers to read,comics whilst I shit.
31656,best hotel to live in,What kind of work do you do that would cause you to have to travel so extensively?
36056,best alcoholic drink,"I think a big part of the crappier workout the next day, for me at least, is that by drinking I released a bunch of endorphins and marginally threw off my brain chemistry and motivation. Any alcohol will put a damper on your workout. I find I always have much more productive workouts when I've been away from alcohol for a few days"
