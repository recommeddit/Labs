With how busy I am nowadays, I tend to get a lot more play time out of them when I can just pick it up and play for a bit during my breaks. It’s nice to play from my bed too, when I wake up and right before I sleep. I have yet to actually play my switch docked for single player games.",best gaming system

37640,"Most people whether or not they’re MCU fans acknowledge that the film is just ok/ typical MCU-fare, which would delegitimize the “overrated” claim, but..

when it came to the initial reactions and eventually awards season, that “overrated” meme got legitimized the moment it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.

He signed books later and he was really nice and polite. I was slightly embarassed because I had a habit at the time of writing/drawing in my books (basically filled with random scribbles) and he just smiled at me and complimented my poor attempt at sketches.
