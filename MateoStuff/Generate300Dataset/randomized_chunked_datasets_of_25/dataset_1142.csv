37030,"Europe does not seem to push the envelope with roller coasters the way the US does, but boy do you guys have a higher standard for parks than us. I was having this conversation with someone at work the other day (not sure how this came up) and told them I didn't think a Six Flags park would be very successful in Europe. Europapark and Alton Towers are probably the two nicest parks I've ever been to. They just blew me away. That level of dedication to quality is rare over here. 

As someone who has a Six Flags as my nearest park (Great Adventure), I almost visit begrudgingly. I go because they have one of the best rides I've ever been on (El Toro), but almost always have some level of regret at going while I'm there. There are few redeeming factors about the overall experience outside of the few top notch rides they have. 

Busch Gardens Williamsburg is a park that maintains a European level quality standard. I was a season pass holder when I lived in North Carolina and I never got bored of going to that place. It's just a pleasant place to be in outside of the ride experience.",best roller coaster at six flags

Second, which country you ""like"" is irrelevant, as you need to ask do I qualify for a visa.",best country to live in

27202,"I'm surprised to see Sid Meiers Civilization at 83. I feel like this game doesnt get talked about enough as a 4x games. It always seems to me that when 4x games gets talked about it is usually Twilight Imperium or Eclipse. 

Civilization is hard to come across these days including the expansions. FFG has even taken down some of their stuff on their website so now there is a 404 error code. I don't think there will ever be a reprint to this game. Maybe a second edition comes out in the future but I doubt it. 

Not only do I enjoy the 4x to this game but I love how you can win in 1 of 4 ways, military, economic, culture, and technology.",best board games

57889,"Cologne depends on where you are going, what you are wearing and what time it is. Here is what I use and recommend:
Everyday: Ed Hardy Love and Luck; Issey Miyake
Club wear: 212 - Carolina Herrera; Black by Kenneth Cole; Versace Pour Homme 
Rule of thumb: light, sweet, fresh scents for everyday; basically anything thats not overpowering. 
When you go out use something heavier, bolder and something that lingers. But dont over do it. 

If your body chemistry sucks don't spray cologne on your skin, spray it on your clothes.

71579,"I like Jurassic World because it's a meta movie about itself. The super cool new Indominus Rex (Jurassic World and the other sequels) is a poorly conceived marketing creation, an amalgamation of what everyone thinks people will like, that in reality pales in comparison and eventually loses to the original T-Rex (Jurassic Park).

If you look at it that way and look at it as a pure popcorn, fun movie it is, that completely lacks the depth and smarts of the original, it works way better.",best movies with a cool twist
