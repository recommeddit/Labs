37030,best roller coaster at six flags,"Europe does not seem to push the envelope with roller coasters the way the US does, but boy do you guys have a higher standard for parks than us. I was having this conversation with someone at work the other day (not sure how this came up) and told them I didn't think a Six Flags park would be very successful in Europe. Europapark and Alton Towers are probably the two nicest parks I've ever been to. They just blew me away. That level of dedication to quality is rare over here. 

As someone who has a Six Flags as my nearest park (Great Adventure), I almost visit begrudgingly. I go because they have one of the best rides I've ever been on (El Toro), but almost always have some level of regret at going while I'm there. There are few redeeming factors about the overall experience outside of the few top notch rides they have. 

Busch Gardens Williamsburg is a park that maintains a European level quality standard. I was a season pass holder when I lived in North Carolina and I never got bored of going to that place. It's just a pleasant place to be in outside of the ride experience."
27062,best board games,"Iâ€™d love help and absolutely would collaborate on that. If you want to start pulling data for the games, we can chat off of Reddit or in PMs."
31199,best country to live in,"First, you are not looking at migration in the right way. You are setting up to fail. You need to do extensive research on individual countries and visit to see which, if any, are places you might be interested in living.

Second, which country you ""like"" is irrelevant, as you need to ask do I qualify for a visa."
11197,best backpack for college,I'd recommend any backpack by Swiss gear. I've had mine for 10 years now.
6774,best iPhone,"I have to say iPhone X. Three years later, it still looks like it's got a solid 2-3 years left in it."
27202,best board games,"I'm surprised to see Sid Meiers Civilization at 83. I feel like this game doesnt get talked about enough as a 4x games. It always seems to me that when 4x games gets talked about it is usually Twilight Imperium or Eclipse. 

Civilization is hard to come across these days including the expansions. FFG has even taken down some of their stuff on their website so now there is a 404 error code. I don't think there will ever be a reprint to this game. Maybe a second edition comes out in the future but I doubt it. 

Not only do I enjoy the 4x to this game but I love how you can win in 1 of 4 ways, military, economic, culture, and technology."
28550,best breakfast foods,"2 eggs, toast, a fruit, and a cup of joe. Can all be made, eaten, and cleaned in 20 minutes."
2998,best webcamera,"Yeah it's true but for cheaper just get a cheaper camera. I've seen old gopro, I think it was a hero 4, plugged in via some chince usb capture card (like it wasn't an expensive capture card, $20 max usb 2.0) and it worked fine, look much better than any 1080p logitec webcam"
70911,best movies with a cool twist,"The Others (2001)

Watched in school to do an essay on and completely fucked with my mind at the end."
14518,best romantic novel,"Uprooted was the first book I read on recommendation from this sub and now all recommendations seem to falter in comparison for how impactful this book was. 

I've like lots of books since which have been recommended, but none which stayed with like Uprooted.  I like you two-trick pony."
57889,best cologne,"Cologne depends on where you are going, what you are wearing and what time it is. Here is what I use and recommend:
Everyday: Ed Hardy Love and Luck; Issey Miyake
Club wear: 212 - Carolina Herrera; Black by Kenneth Cole; Versace Pour Homme 
Rule of thumb: light, sweet, fresh scents for everyday; basically anything thats not overpowering. 
When you go out use something heavier, bolder and something that lingers. But dont over do it. 

If your body chemistry sucks don't spray cologne on your skin, spray it on your clothes. 

(Used to work in a perfume/cologne store for few years)"
51286,best iphone case,Ima just buy a 13 pro once my case ships in early October
35322,best alcoholic drink,"White Russian is scary cause you gotta keep track of what you drink that night. I once drank a white Russian and a whiskey ginger back to back.

It was miserable."
10463,best suitcase lock,"I imagine the stars aligning and a particular flight where all passengers on board have read this tip somewhere and the cabin is just filled to the brim with suitcases.

Made me chuckle anyway."
6253,best Netflix documentary,Roger stone and Roy cone the attorney docs were so interesting. Great insight to trump political push all the way back to early . Crazy stuff.
14136,best place to get free books,Bruh !! Thank you so much
71579,best movies with a cool twist,"I like Jurassic World because it's a meta movie about itself. The super cool new Indominus Rex (Jurassic World and the other sequels) is a poorly conceived marketing creation, an amalgamation of what everyone thinks people will like, that in reality pales in comparison and eventually loses to the original T-Rex (Jurassic Park).

If you look at it that way and look at it as a pure popcorn, fun movie it is, that completely lacks the depth and smarts of the original, it works way better."
39808,best Chrome extensions,"Those aren't the ones you need to worry about, its the ones you expect that never come that are the issue"
55101,best places to hike in the east coast,That and we have the Adirondack Park. The park agency is super strict and does not fuck around and would not let that happen.
45411,best gaming system,"Pc is for anything first person, strategy, and sim type games. Switch is for Nintendo exclusive, and indies that I will play more in short sessions. PS4/5 is for exclusives, and smaller Japanese games that tend to get pretty shoddy ports years later."
