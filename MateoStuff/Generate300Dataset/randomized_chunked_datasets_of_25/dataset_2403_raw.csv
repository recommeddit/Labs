I've been using the VG27AQ for a week now and it's been incredible so far.
Box cutter. As a kid I had no idea I'd spend so much of my adult life breaking down boxes for recycling.
"the movie is good, you should read the book. they don't show the unicorn beheading in the movie."
My brother has never even seen Wow and yet has watched this video more than once and quotes it often.
"Zero - 10/10 control 4/10 speed

Otsu v2 - 9/10 control 6/10 speed

Hien - 7/10 control 7/10 speed

Raiden 5/10 control 8/10 speed

Shidenkai 3/10 control 10/10 speed

Something like that üëç"
The last thing we need is more doctors who don't want to truly be doctors. It's hard frustrating work and it about helping other people survive and get by a lot of the time.

My mom always gives out the best candy because she buys those little paper bags with ghosts on them and then fills them with three or four different pieces of candy. Even better is when she has lots of leftovers and gives me all the extra bags.
"The Goonies is a good one. It's a fun movie to watch. Does Jurassic Park count as an adventure movie? If it does, then Jurassic Park. An incredible film!"

"For value and friendliness, the Holiday Inn Express in Lexington KY, off of Sharkey way. There's a young guy who works there who memorizes all of the guests names. No matter how long it's been since you've been there, he always greets you by name. Such a nice touch when you're a road warrior."
Shiesty Season for me. Big Brrrrr
"Good call on the HoF website. I misremembered how is was formatted. Still, it‚Äôs almost a consensus that AP is by far the most widely coveted and used All Pro team. 

HoF site also lists Pro Bowl appearances the same as All Pro awards, but that in no way means Pro Bowls are weighted the same as All Pros. It‚Äôs essentially an overview of the player‚Äôs career.

Also, SN isn‚Äôt used for compensatory picks by the league, only AP and PFWA are. Even Wikipedia says AP is the most widely recognized All Pro team.

AP is not only the most ‚Äúimportant‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the most used and widely recognized of any All Pro team."
It‚Äôs free candy. Shut up and take it

Awesome! I appreciate it :)
