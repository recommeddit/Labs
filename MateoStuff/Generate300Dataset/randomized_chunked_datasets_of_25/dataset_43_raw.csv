My gaming laptop list will be updated for September.
"There is a lot more math involved in this major than you would expect.

Edit: I'm talking about the major takes a lot of math classes not the industry just to clarify"
"I have to recommend Standard Ebooks: standardebooks.org

It's basically like Gutenberg, but volunteer-led teams take up the old-form Gutenberg text and do some serious editing to modernize/clean up typos/etc. and to provide modern, e-reader friendly design."
"I'm a fan of [Classic Specs. ](https://www.classicspecs.com/collection/mens-sunglasses)I think they're pretty unknown. I own a pair of the Cypress and have really enjoyed them. Almost no scratches even though I'm not babying them. Also having a sale at the moment, $49 for every pair."
"{The bird and the sword by Amy Harmon} is BEAUTIFUUUULLLLL. It’s one of those books that I appreciate its prose either as much or more than the story itself. Like you, sometimes I get on a spate of amateur novels and this was an excellent palate cleanser. 

(Though then of course it’s frustrating to go back...lol)"
"I have edited it lol, sorry."
"Western Governors University is about $3500 per 6 month term, completely online, non-profit, and competency based. If you have previous education your credits may transfer, and if you’re already competent in a subject you can pass a class in a day. They have both business and tech degrees."
">IE10? How’s that even still available?

As it was the default browser in Win8 and WinSvr2012, it has a support life-cycle tied to those OSs. Win8.0 is already completely EOL (8.1 is supported, though came with IE11) but Svr2012 has extended support until 2023. Thankfully few use that for active browsing.

I've only been released from having to support IE8 on some of our work in the last year-ish.  
IE11 is still what a lot of our clients'^(\[†\]) users are stuck with.

^(\[†\] companies in regulated industries, investment banks for the most part)"
"Taffy's is the best, especially for families"
"Jansports quality has gone to shit. I returned 3 backpacks that all broke within a few years of use. Of the three new bags they sent as replacement, 2 of them are already broken again, the third is on its way."
"Sorry for any crap formatting.. on mobile. 

Grey grey grey.... 


And then for the adventurous people - 

Muted colours, so soft pinks, blues, greens. 

Then you’ve also got people into your “spicier” colours so plummy browns and spicy reds. 

Gem like tones are also pretty popular, emerald greens, sapphire, ruby.. 

Then a lot of nature tones?

Sorry that was heaps and probably didn’t help hah.."
Look into the crackdown series. Lots of fun on my old 360.
What would you consider a flaw?
Stardust.
"Don't ask, once you see it you might never unsee it."
I'm not sure if that's better or worse!
Or Duality
"Keesler:  AT&T and Verizon will give you the best coverage.  T-Mobile will give you really good speeds if you don't venture west of Gulfport, north of D'Iberville, or east of Ocean Springs.  Sprint is hit or miss even though they just upgraded their network to LTE there last year."

Hate fucking is the best kind of fucking.
Reality is often disappointing
Marketing AKA how to bullshit most efficiently
"Those are about $50 over OP's budget.  Good headphones though, just bought a pair recently and I like them a lot."
I don’t even care about the OLED to be honest. If the 11 came with a high res display I would have gotten it over the 11PM that I ended up with.
