I remember drinking a full can of Monster for a biology lab last year and my nerves were shot. I got the whole eye twitching, shaking hands type-deal. It kept me up, but it also made me feel uncomfortable and jumpy. Instead, I'll just take a short walk or a nap to wake me up.",best energy drink

37634,"I’m fine with someone thinking it’s overrated on an individual level. All the better if they have actual points of criticism they honestly want to talk about! But on a subreddit level sometimes it feels a little cult-like and like the only opinion you’re allowed to have. I don’t mean to shit on people who don’t like BP, I’m just beyond tired of talking about it. If BP, T’Challa, Killmonger, etc. come up in the comments of a thread about all the movies, it seems like people trip over themselves to be the first ones to say it was overrated.

It’s gotten to the point that whenever anything about the movie is praised at all, I’m prepping myself for a ton of negativity from others about it.  I get real Last Jedi vibes from it and it’s just draining and not fun to talk about anymore.",best Marvel movie

Ha, I admit I'm not an expert on this, but my dad used to take me along on some of his fishing trips along the coast and streams in Denmark. Along the coast I know you can catch sea trout, Atlantic cod, garfish, herring, coalfish and I think mackarel as well.

In the freshwater streams, you can catch perch, river trout and sturgeon (and a bunch of others, but these two I'm pretty sure of).",best country to live in
