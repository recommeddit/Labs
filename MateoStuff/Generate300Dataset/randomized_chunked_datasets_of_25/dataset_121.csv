65168,"Verizon and ATT in my experience have less spotty reception in very rural areas, although in the middle of nowhere-land there's still plenty of coverage holes all over the place.

T mobile MVNOs can be extremely budget friendly, so that's my choice.

T mobile also doesn't follow ATT's practice of banning any device except for a narrow list of approved devices.",best phone service company
26138,"I honestly believe that the assassination of Bobby Kennedy is the most momentous political event in the latter half of the 20th century. If he'd managed to win in 1968, I don't know what the country and our politics would look like, but they'd undoubtedly be very different.

Edit: yes, in the context of US politics, not the whole damn world.",best politician

46826,"S&W and Sanitizer have their place. I wouldn't replace S&W with Alcohol based sanitizer for all use, but for times when you can't get to S&W, sanitizer is an adequate replacement. 

I don't know about ""anti-microbial"" soap. You must also take into account the adverse effects of obsessive cleaning of everything to clinical levels and the kind of resistance such ""sanitization"" can cause. 
The idea is not to turn your hand into the surgeon's scalpel but to reduce the harmful communities on your hands to a manageable level (manageable by your own immune system etc.) ... 

my main beef is with the post itself. it doesn't support the claim made by the title. Sanitizer being inferior is an auxiliary matter and can be argued either way depending on acceptability criteria.",best hand santizer brand

I didn't know this actually, since I used it as an opportunity to go through and delete old accounts on services I didn't use and change my passwords from old, insecure, reused ones to new, secure ones. After you install it, just click the extension then: Account options -> Advanced -> Import -> Google Chrome Password Manager

Also, whenever you log into a site lastpass will pop up to save it just like chrome does, which is great for new accounts. They also add a little button on new password fields to autogenerate and fill secure passwords.",best Chrome extensions
