"Perhaps the son is a hipster, and ironically said ""some beer"" when in reality it was a pallet of Calgary."

Hands down, one of my favorite truly-free IOS games. Itâ€™s a card game (think Hearthstone), but I like the gameplay a LOT more in all honesty."
Nice try.. Mom!
"More so. A French victory in that war would have meant no American Revolution and no USA, although we can speculate that given the larger number of American colonists than French in North America, it's likely the colonies would have eventually won their independence from the French, but everything would have been different."
"Spore can also be acurate as bacterial endospores are resistant to bleaching as well as just about everything else we can throw at them. Species of bacteria that can form endospores include C. tetani (causes tetanus), B. cereus, B. subtilis and B. anthracis (bacteria causing anthrax)."
"I really like, Catan (all versions) and the resistance. Super fun!"

I LOVED Misfits in the first two seasons and quickly lost interest in season 3. Can you give it a go convincing me to come back to it? It always bothered me that I never finished.
"River.  Hinterland.   Shetland.

It's a movie, but you might enjoy Wind River."
"The entire Miss Dior lineup. I need the snag the newest one. 

Burberry Brit: my first high end perfume 

Flowerbomb: my wedding scent 


On a day to day basis though I usually wear a body spray from Victoria's Secret. Pure seduction and love spell are the two I have, I think."

"[Evidence](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/19/12252.full.pdf+html) of van der Waals forces in gecko setae.

Rarely do you see evidence presented so simply. Hopes for setae dry-adhesive products in the future have sky-rocketed since this paper."
"I'm in agreement with u/VanyaKmzv.

Book of the New Sun is my favorite series of all time. I read the first two books in highschool and found it incredibly interesting but couldn't stick through to the end. I started it over again as an adult and just couldn't put it down. Once you lock in to Gene Wolfe's imagination, his writing becomes so incredibly clear and his characters all have a uniqueness to them that I don't see replicated often. I got busy with work and need to get back into the Sun books, but Long Sun is also amazing. Someday I'll finish it and read Short Sun."

"Can confirm /u/MysticTyph00n has a boner right now.

Itâ€™s impressive."

"[Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/) and [Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrewmead/) are by far the best teachers I've ever seen. Also [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/courses/). I can recommend all of their courses without hesitation, they're brilliant.

If you're looking for the one best place to start, I recommend [this one](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)."
"1. Paladog - still playing this on an old device. My favorite mobile game of all time.

2. Chrono Trigger - the greatest game of all time.

3. Street Fighter IV - my go-to game if I wanna beat someone up.

4. Zombieville 2 - mindless fun

5. Retro Bowl - the best football game of all time lol."
"I would also like to know the best brands, specifically in Canada."
