26953,best board games,That's fair criticism.  I'm only about 25 sessions in and have only seen 2 non-starting classes so I'm not completely knowledgeable about some of your claims.
6322,best Netflix documentary,I loved Nightstalker. I was on the edge of my seat.
68298,best science fiction novel,"Nah, the Shadow Series is pretty much a different genre of sci-fi entirely. I definitely prefer Ender's Game to Ender's Shadow, but also definitely prefer the Shadow Series to the Ender Quartet."
65001,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"First, adjust your expectations. San Diego population = 1.3M. Santa Barbara population = 90k. The reason this is important is some guy isn't going to open an Ethiopian restaurant if nobody is going to eat there. With that said, SB does have some great food, especially with Mexican (people love it here, especially White people).

Mexican - La Super Rica, El Sitio, Del Valle Grill, Freebirds, Los Agaves, Los Arroyos

Asian - this is not about getting good Asian, it's about getting the best _for the area_. Sushi High End - Ahi, Sakana, Arigato. Mid Range - Edomasa, Itsuki, Sushi Teri (I'd argue this is straddling the mid-low line)

What else is bugging you? Lack of: Korean BBQ? an IKEA? Target? Good Middle-Eastern choices? Wild Animal Park?"

47431,best state to visit in the United States,for food and sightseeing on the west coast San Fransisco with a side trip to Sonoma and Napa counties is a must. then head on up to Seattle for more great food and beautiful sights and interesting things to do.
15530,best tree for the garden,"You want to plant a tree that provides a return (profit) in 5 years? Uhm.. weed. Plant weed.  

Real trees take many years to grow to the size necessary to be sold at a profit. Pine is usually grown commercially because it grows so fast, does well in close stands (more trees per acre), and is easy to harvest. It takes about 35 years from plant to maximum harvest, but you will get smaller 'thinning' harvests before that."
