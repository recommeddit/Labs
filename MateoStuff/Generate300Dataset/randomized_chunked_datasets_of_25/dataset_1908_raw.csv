Oui l'amour Yves Rocher. Got the 30ml and I love it
"Home Depot, I've always liked their selection. Lumber sucks but I do like their other stuff."
"Primer was one of those movies you have to watch 2 or 3 times - but idk if it's so much of a ""OH MYGOD!"" twist as a ""say what now? hold on I gotta go back and watch it again"""

East and central Florida att is better though
can't believe my little country is at 26. bit proud ngl lol
Is this one of the trauma porn books you mentioned?
"Honestly happy he’s on here, although as a Steelers fan I could debate him against Minkah. 

Jesting aside though, Bates is so underrated on a national level and across non-AFCN fanbases it’s disturbing."
"Woo, always awesome to see upstate get some love."

I got a pack of pencils and it included two completely graphite ones. One of those broke in two different places. It's irritating because they're new and don't seem cheap.
"Like, temperature-wise?"

Don't forget Amla! Prime Amla was the best SAF batsman in his team!
"My pediatrician always seemed to like the fact that I was against antibiotics unless we were sure it was necessary! My son is almost 5 and has never had one and I’m so happy about that:)

Unfortunately my daughter started getting them from the get-go, multiple rounds while I was in labor (group b strep) then after cleft repair surgery, another for chest infection, and another for ear infection. She’s 3 and overall healthy but I am convinced she gets sicker and stays sick longer when they catch the same bugs."
"I first had a pickleback shot at some bar in Brooklyn that is whiskey and bacon themed. The shot glass was creatively folded bacon. God bless that place.

EDIT: Lots of people asking me what the place was called... I honestly don't know cause I was wasted and I'm not a local. If you ask enough hipsters in Williamsburg about the ""whiskey and bacon place"" I bet you'll find it though!"
"I listen to a wide variety of music;
Metal -the human abstract
Pop-rock-Pvris
Rap - post Malone
Those are the top ones"

"Pleasantly surprised seeing South Africa there. Wessels+Hansie's teams.

We had Pollock, Kallis, Donald, Ntini, Cullinan, the Kirstens, McMillan. I must be missing some other greats. Rice was too old to still play a major role. Hudson was OK, Dave Richardson was solid. I suppose Gibbs also played in that era. Jonty!, I almost forgot - his stats don't show it, but he was a major part of that team - I think not just his fielding, but his positive attitude was great. 

My brother would want me to say Snell - but he was never quite so good."
"The only reason most people take an education is that ""stamp"" though.
I have thousands of lectures, hundreds and thousands of studies and books, millions of articles at my fingertips. If I want to learn, I can learn."
Thank you man. The GSR-SE is sold out but I definitely wanna look into the aqua control+ or the inked pad
"> I've always thought Tendulkar was overrated.

Best ODI batsman ever for me. However, in tests, I'd take Kallis. I'd still take Tendulkar tho and have to push out Sanga."
Oh dear god. This took me back.
"You probably mean McDoubles, as double cheeseburgers are a little pricier, and they just raised the price on the mcdouble too.  So you might get 40."
