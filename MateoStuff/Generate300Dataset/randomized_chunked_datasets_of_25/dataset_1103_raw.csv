"Every year for Father's Day (or the weekend before/after depending on if I am out of town for work), I will take my dad golfing or on a camping/fishing trip just by ourselves.  I feel like it's a lot better than giving him ""stuff"".  Making memories with him is huge for me, even though he's only in his 40's.  Seeing a lot of folks on here whom have lost their fathers makes me really want to enjoy our time together. Anything can happen at any time, and that scares the shit out of me."
"No Broken Bells. No Sublime. No Phoenix. No Deftones. No Tool. Michael Jackson's Thriller album is 131, yet Nirvana's In Utero is 35? And Random Access Memories makes the list? That album is a pile of shit and the fact that the author of this list is caught up in its popularity to the point of including it here shows that this entire list, and every list that tries to rank art, is a pile of shit."
None of these sound tasty lol I really donâ€™t like oatmeal but I can do eggs
"Honestly probably this. Who wouldn't be happy to hear they get to stop doing their routine job dealing with the public and get to have a nice sit down unwrapping bottles, and still get paid. 

Frustrated TSA? Probably made that attendant's day."
"I get good tequila and just drink that chilled, maybe with some lime."
"I actually used amazon a while back, didn't have anywhere near the volume I have now back then."
"I have to ask having lived near Chicago, is this a legit Chicago style? Not just a thick crust with toppings but rather a vessel of cheese and toppings with sauce on the top? Gino's east or Giordano's style."
Noel Coward said that to make the perfect martini you added gin and then wave it in the general direction of Italy.
Predictions for this decade?
"Unpopular Opinion but i find Gloomhaven so overrated, to me its just a skirmish game"
Your immune system.
So you're saying that the study of Psychology isn't a science? Really??
"Target costs more but it's still the same, low quality bullshit as everywhere else, but I get what you're saying."
By Tim Taylor you mean Al Borland?
"id love a game with good graphics. thats half the reason i play battlefield, because it lets me use the kickass card I bought. Do you think forza has the best?"
"How many apartments make you pay for a parking spot and how many parking spots do you expect me to pay for? 

Parking at my apartment is 100$. 2 cars that's 200. Insurance is 200+200. That's an extra 300 per month on top of the cost of the cars.  Just to have a car used for snow days? 

It was legit cheaper to get a BMW m240i used then to do a miata+winter beater. I'm in NY so it could be the location but it's not an easy choice. 

And that's me with the no student debt and ok salary."
"i was always that kid that got super pissed off when i took the time to walk up to someones front door and they only gave me one piece of candy. especially when it was like, one tootsie roll or something. two is always best, its not to gracious, but you also won't be that one house that gives out one tootsie roll because they're cheap. kids know this stuff."
MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRICAAAAAAAAAAA!!!  jk i hate that place
"Just reading this thread it seems that everyone universally looks down upon third party reservations. Every single time I've tried to book direct on a hotel's website, it's always way more expensive, sometimes unbelievably so. All the third party websites give me cheaper rates basically 100% of the time. Any idea why this is? I've heard that booking direct is better but never done it because of how much more expensive it is."
I really do like it. I just can't eat too much or I get a headache lol
if i wanted advice about my health then id ask a real doctor
How was Walter Jones not on the first list?
"Maybe that's because we can actually afford it? And have doctors, we can see for free, that tell us what would help?"
Kleenex and Puffs are fine for me. I only need to blow on a tissue once or twice. It is not being saved like a handkerchief. I would rather it be soft than scratchy is all.
Came here to say this. It's not often you get a documentary that starts as one thing and ends on the frontline of a global controversy
