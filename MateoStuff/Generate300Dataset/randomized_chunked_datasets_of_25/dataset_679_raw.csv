"What I meant was the if you admob account is banned, and you are using their mediation for peace of mind, you are SOL.
  

Also, Admobs TOS states that a minimum percentage of fills must come from Admob if using their mediation service.  Of course, you will never know why your account is banned because they will not tell you."
"I’d like to take this moment to say that The Signal 2007 is also really interesting.  This is not what the OP is looking for at all, but I just don’t get opportunities to talk about that movie."
Remember when I promised to kill you last? I lied.

"Yeah, don't want to accidentally eat spoiled food if the power went out for say, 2 days, then came back on and refroze the food. But it would also let me know if the freezer is sporadically working or not maintaining temperature below freezing consistently."

"[The Spymaster's Lady by Joanna Bourne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/959745.The_Spymaster_s_Lady) is my favourite book. It is so good that it is far beyond, ""too good to put down"" and has achieved the rarefied level of, ""can hardly bear to pick up again"" because you are savoring what has already happened, but are also afraid that this sublime quality cannot be maintained. Spoiler— the quality is maintained.

It is a adventure romance of enemies in Napoleonic France and England where the attraction is founded upon respect for each other's skill and character, with physical sex appeal secondary.

The heroine, Annique Villiers, is one of the four characters in my, ""Pantheon of heroines"".

Don't look at the cover. It is undoubtedly sabotage, the work of a jealous rival who knows they will never equal this work ;-)

BTW, this is not the sort of topic where every, or even most comments require a reply for politeness. An upvote like I do on WDYR is sufficient thanks."
"Yeah joint rated is most accurate. League titles you guys lead 20-18, Liverpool lead champions leagues 5-3, fa cups united are ahead 12-7, uefa cup/europa league is Liverpool 3-1 and the league cup is Liverpool 8-5. So according to that both sides have 41 major trophies apiece. United jump ahead when you include Community Shield as its 17-10 in those but whether or not thats a major trophy is up for debate.

Seems ive misread the community shield records. It is 21-15 overall."

"Personally the only locks i use are ""BEST"" locks. 7 pins, pinned/modified by me.   


They can be picked, but even people more skilled than myself take >10 minutes to pick them.  


Those keep a pelican case closed. I use two of them with different key/types (best locks have many different keyways based on the letter of keyway the lock has (Like there is a key A and a key B, and they could have the same pinouts, but fit different keyways. Its actually really neat)"
"As a fat footed woman, have you ever tried Brookes sneakers because they changed my fucking life. I have brick shaped feet,  and by that I mean have EEE feet combined with a high foot bone and shallow ankle. Brookes are the only ones that did it.

For dress shoes, legit Crocs. They make more than clogs and my only heels and flats are from there because the default widths there are significantly wider"
That’s exactly how I felt. I felt like I was having a fever dream the entire time and it just felt so incredibly weird that I’m not actually sure if I enjoyed it or not (I think I did..?)
Hey thanks so much I appreciate it. Hope your XM1 gets there soon and that it lives up to the hype. The coating is super nice you’re right
