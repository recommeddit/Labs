vodka soda or vodka water with lime. Fight your hangover while you get shitfaced!
"That's what gas vehicles seem like to me already. Eventually EVs will be obsolete, but we've got a long way to go before then."
"Me too. I have a great psychiatrist who noticed I might benefit from a higher dosage of a stimulant (Adderall XR) and a lower dosage of my anxiety medicine (Lexapro) and after suffering through major depression and the causing lack of energy and interest in life, I truly have never felt better. I had been through so many medications that didn’t work for me and it was a relief to find something that didn’t make me feel like a zombie or jumpy and hyperactive."
"Looks like they don't teach proper vocabulary usage in CS, uh?"
"Each of them iconic enough to be known by one name only, tho, eh? Who is the crazy one now?"
"I gross about 100k/yr.  I just sort of fell into this job.  I graduated with an engineering degree and had some construction experience.  While working at a firm, the work was slow and my boss knew someone at my current company that needed an inspector for a short project.  My firm farmed me out contract and the company was so impressed with my work they hired me and and sent me on projects they were having issues on.  At first I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but eventually when you're sent out to solve a problem, you just figure it out."
"We live on a well, and use a reverse-osmosis filter for our drinking water.  Can anyone compare what that does vs. a Brita filter?  Does it remove minerals, like lead, and does it screen bacteria?"
"That is what I was thinking.

Paul's Boutique > Ill communication"
"That looks correct. I may wait until Black Friday for a deal on a monitor. Not too sure yet, and I doubt I’m gonna be able to get a series x anytime soon lol."
Nope. Worked for an airline. Seen TSA do all kinds of B'S. Even made a gal open her bag in baggage claim because her vibrator was going off.
Malibu with pineapple juice.
"My preferred go to healthy and cheap breakfast is an English muffin with Canadian bacon or turkey bacon, egg whites, choice of cheese and spinach. I meal prep them and either eat them in the car on the way to work or at my desk. Also I eat some almonds afterwards because it leaves you feeling full."
"Scottish Tap water. So crisp, so fresh. :)"
"Yes, I have often thought that recommendations ONLY work when they are paired like ""if you like X you might like Y.""

I do like Honor Harrington, Leary and Lost Fleet and Kris Longknife, so I think our tastes are VERY similar!

I see you liked Deathstalker by Simon R Green. Did you try his Nightside series? I really loved them  


I also see you liked a John Ringo book. Have you tried the series starting with We Few by David Weber and John Ringo? Another favorite of mine."
"I think it's called ""chip it"""
"Depends on the area at&t is the worst in my city

The problem with individuals attitude like these are that they don’t realize if everybody had his/her type of mentality and nobody contributed to society......they wouldn’t be enjoying PC and internet....or receiving unemployment money..... Shame. Shame. Shame.
"Someone already said it, but definitely Hilton Head Island. It's such a beautiful island and isn't too big, isn't too small. You can easily rent bikes as a way to get around. The beaches are great and clean.

I love Coligny Plaza the best, there are so many cute shops there and a couple of cool restaurants. Salty Dog in Sea Pines is a cool experience. On the other side of the island is the restaurant Hudson's which is great for a fancier meal. 

Harbour Town is a neat area. I'm pretty sure there is a dolphin cruise near there. Kayaking is a great recreational activity.

There is an outlet mall just off the highway before you get on the island that is always a must. 

I've gone there 10 times and it never gets old. There is always something new to do. This year is the first time I'm going since 2016 and I'm so excited, I've missed it."
No where to be found on Netflix anymore. Why do they do this. With so much mediocre crap on the site??
"my bad, I know Hadlee was around but dont know how good the Kiwis were."
"whenever I feel a cold coming on, I give it the 1-2 punch with Airborne and NyQuil. I take Airborne once in the morning and then right before bed, I take it again with a shot of NyQuil. I pump myself up with vitamins and knock myself out with NyQuil.

don't overexert yourself during the day and get to bed early. It works like a dream"
Peter Capaldi swearing at the people that get my voicemail message is the first thing I'd buy if I win the lottery.
