62255,Best RPG game on PS4,"It's nothing like the older Assassin's Creed games. You can climb anything, literally. There's a lot of different gear. It also takes place in ancient Greece, and the mythology is really cool, same with origins, but I like Greek mythology more."

42156,movies like Inception,"[Special](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Special/70042683)

I just made this recommendation in a different topic, but it fits your ""question reality"" requirement perfectly. It's not as hilarious as the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4sZaoqLfBM) might suggest but Michael Rapaport is really good in it and it is definitely unique."
62247,Best RPG game on PS4,"Ok but there’s black flag which is open world has tons of sea doesn’t have places which are locked until you play for hundreds of hours and is higher quality.

Also in the opitcal section they have a larger selection (More name brand stuff like Police, Oakley, Persol, REVO, Serengeti, etc, etc...).  - again very reasonably priced. I bought some Hobies for around $40 and i'm very happy with them. Polarized, etc."
