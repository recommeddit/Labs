68659,"Not all of them were written in the 21st century, but Iain M Banks's Culture books stack up with any sci fi I've read.

Anathem by Neal Stephenson.  I see Seveneves and Snowcrash below, but Anathem was vastly better than either in my opinion.

The Martian by Andy Weir.  It has it's critics and I get where they're coming from especially after Artemis, but I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it so it must have something going for it.",best science fiction novel

27558,"I don't like how he stole credit for TZP. If you see the movie, it has a clear first half (focused on the kid, very sensitive and empathetic) and the second half where the hero and saviour makes an appearance. Very tonally different and it's obvious who directed what part.",best bollywood actor

33156,My brother did a good job describing why he drinks energy drinks the other day. He is a carpenter and I work in IT at a desk all day. He said he cant drink coffee anymore at work because it just makes him want to relax. So he just pounds back an energy drink when he gets to work and is ready to start hammering nails all day. I on the other hand get to work with my coffee and relax at my desk while sipping that sweet java cup for the first hour of work.,best energy drink

55239,"Week-long loops are tough. Doing a two car shuttle would let you do a chunk of one of the long trails.  Actually, doing part of the Long Trail in Vermont would be a good choice.  It's much more remote feeling than SNP is.  

I'd look at the White Mountains in New Hampshire. There's enough trails there that you could definitely do a week-long loop, or do an end-to-end with the AMC's shuttle service running you back to your car at the end. The scenery is about as epic as the east coast has to offer. There's a bunch of above treeline alpine hiking, waterfalls, moose, beaver, etc.  But it comes at a price; there's lots of restrictions on campsites, and you usually have to pay.",best places to hike in the east coast
