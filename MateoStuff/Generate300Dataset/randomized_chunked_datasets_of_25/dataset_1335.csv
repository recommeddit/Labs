67503,axios alternatives reddit,"We’re likely transitioning to just `fetch` and then `node-fetch` on the backend.

We were talking about it for a while, and with the deprecation, it’s just a good time. A lot of our infrastructure is moving serverless now too to Cloudflare Workers, so having one `fetch` API across our front-end, back-end and serverless apps is going to be great."

32794,best free online grammar checker,"1. Use Word grammar checker (or grammar checker on whatever I'm using to write)
2. Read it again, from start to finish. Probably aloud to hear if what I wrote actually sounds like it written by a human being.
3. Read it backwards (it's weird and slow, but you can actually concentrate better on words and see if they are misspelled). 
4. Copy the text to hemingway app to check and improve passive/active voice use, sentence structure and length and overall readability."
50760,best rap album,"1. Honestly not sure, maybe Bright Green Field or Haram.

2. D.I.A.L. off of Topaz Jones' new album

3. Joshua Idehen on Field Negus

Next set of questions cuz eh

1. Easily Sons of Kemet - Black to the Future. The cover alone had me hyped.

2. I don't listen to bad albums lmao, if I don't like the first 3 tracks or so I don't listen to the rest

3. Either Genesis Owusu, Topaz Jones, or Anna Fox Rochinski

4. Not sure if these apply but Roadrunner, Sound Ancestors, and Demidevil

5. Either Bystander by Cool Sounds or Black to the Future by Sons of Kemet. I'll always shout out nu-jazz albums (the latter) and the former is one of the most pretty-sounding bluegrass albums I've ever heard. It literally feels like a warm sunny day."

18598,best YouTube video,I think it was the alcohol tidal wave since the people tried to drink it afterwards. Debris and all
8590,best toothpaste,"Same reason you don't use steel wool to scrub off your glasses.  Although it feels like it's doing more, it'll slowly wear away the out enamel on your teeth, and actually doesn't get as well into the nooks and crannies to get gunk out because they don't flex as much."
12734,best gifts for mom,"A professional massage.  I've been so stressed chasing after the kids, it would be really helpful.  Also, a nice meal with my family... Thai or Vietnamese would be perfect."
41036,best instrument to play,"If you want to play an instrument to enjoy playing, piano would get my vote.

BUT.....

Get a chord book and a ""fake book"" and learn to read simple lead sheet.  That's probably your easiest and shortest path to success on the piano.  Most piano hobbyists are quite happy with this level of skill and proficiency..... and it helps at parties.

However, if you want to be technically proficient or play classical, piano has a VERY large skill gap. Performing at a high level is extremely difficult.  The phrase, ""a minute to learn, a lifetime to master"" is particularly true with piano."

62058,Best RPG game on PS4,"It's definitely the weakest of the three. I *loved* Origins, really enjoyed Odyssey, and am just kind of playing through Valhalla to get it finished."
46329,best trick or treating candy,"Ask your neighbours to estimate how many kids they got last year.  Adjust candy amounts accordingly.  

Let the kids pick, it makes it more fun for them.  I always give out full size candy.  The kids lose it with excitement when they get not only a large chocolate but get to pick between their favourites."
13389,best spreadsheet editor,"Paralles for Mac *is* virtualization. You can pay for it or use VirtualBox for a free alternative. It will be slightly more difficult to setup and seamless mode is not as good but it's more than enough to just run Excel in a VM.

Depending on your Mac's hardware any kind of virtualization might be a but sluggish though, especially with Windows guests. 4GB RAM total should be the absolute minimum and that's already pushing it."
