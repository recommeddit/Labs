59404,best perfume,Amazing Grace by Philosophy
31532,best hotel to live in,"Grand Wailea on Maui? We had a trip planned there for next month, but they just announced that visitor quarantine has been extended through July, so we're going to have to cancel :(

We used to live about a mile away from the Grand, so we've been excited to take the kids there (and maybe make it a bit of a tradition)."
1557,best ice cream flavor,"I don't remember the taste being particularly spicy no. It was some time ago I have to say, but I do remember asking for the recipe.. in vain ;)"
70146,best major to study in college,Because generally the goal of going to college is to avoid working those low-paying retail jobs.
72734,best wireless lightweight mouse,"Model D and X lite are way safer shapes then the Origin, but they are all pretty damn good."
48303,best color to paint with,Who are these rich people that redo a room completely?
24332,best anime,"I'd hope for Mind Game too. Love Yuasa (though in general his series are way better than his movies, especially in recent years) and I wouldn't be surprised."
37014,best roller coaster at six flags,I even enjoyed Shockwave and I think Delirium is an upgrade.
72551,best keyboard switches,"My preference is the MX Reds as well.

I actually switched to mechanical (MX Red) recently and have noticed a lot less hand fatigue while typing or gaming."
47665,best state to visit in the United States,What's the address?
16730,best pet for toddlers,"Although I think rats are a far better choice than a hamster or rabbit, I'll be the odd one out and also suggest some beginner reptiles. They are infinitely easier to care for than fish and can be incredibly gentle, rewarding pets. Unlike rats, they have essentially zero social requirements, i.e. your reptile will not mind if it becomes a pet that doesn't get held every day. I would personally recommend corn snakes, which are a more active species that likes to slither and explore, or ball pythons, most of which will happily curl up anywhere warm and stay there indefinitely. Not every individual is going to be a good choice for a child, but most individuals in these two species are docile and become quite tame with a little handling. They also eat (and therefore poop) infrequently, so cage cleaning is far less frequent than with something like a rat."
51656,best iphone case,"Pitaka

4694,best home improvement store,"Looks for a place called Appliance Smart.

Same part numbers as everyone else at MUCH lower prices.  We got our new set of kitchen appliances for 40% less than everyone else's sale prices.  No need to wait for holiday sales either.  Oh and free shipping and removal of the old appliances.

BTW: replacing the 20 year old electric appliances cut our electric bill in HALF!  Yes, over the same months..."
33552,best electric car,"You didnâ€™t read. You suggested that charger problems are a thing of the past, I linked you a less than day old post where three vehicles rolled into an EA charger and none of them could charge. Just getting you up to date - still sucks."
47637,best state to visit in the United States,Mammoth Cave was going to be my suggestion as well. It's amazing.
17740,best Kardashian,Lol what?she is the most evil one
59196,best perfume,"I'm still bummed that Clinique stopped making Happy to Be, but my go-to is the classic Happy. When I have it on, no one ever identifies it correctly; something in my body chemistry alters the scent. It ends up being unrecognizable, but soo summery and fun.

If you do go sampling a variety of fragrances, remember to bring a cup of black coffee or a small packet of coffee beans. Smell one, then smell the coffee. It helps cleanse your nose-palate (I'm sure there's a real word for it but oh well) so you can smell the next one more clearly."
14429,best romantic novel,"Same here, I'm still not over it ðŸ˜©"
46110,best trick or treating candy,"Mid-level score for a kid, but top 15% compared to other houses overall."
71063,best movies with a cool twist,"The Prestige. Fantastic film overall too.

Arrival. A perfect twist that doesnâ€™t feel like a cheat but causes you to reevaluate everything youâ€™ve seen.

Old boy. One of the most jaw dropping turns of recent years.

Memento. A modern classic for a reason - who thought that a film that goes in reverse could have a mega twist?

The Handmaiden. Genuinely couldnâ€™t tell where the plot was going after the first 45 minutes or so.

Unbreakable. To me, even better than Sixth Sense!"
36303,best alcoholic drink,"Oh, I've tried plenty. Always open to recommendations btw. In terms of sheer taste, there are probably better ones out there. But part of what makes it the best for me is that it's such a tasty whiskey at a very affordable price point. Blanton's is good too, but $60+ dollars a bottle is roughly twice as expensive as ER10. 

Another great whiskey for the price is Wild Turkey 101. It's also far more available than ER10. Lots of people hear Wild Turkey and think it's some trashy swill, but they're wrong. I just see it as more for me."
9704,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Third year here. My first year I was placed in San Nicolas Hall, on the 7th floor, ocean side. As far as views go, it was really hard to beat. I had a straight view to the pier and faced east so I got super amazing sunrises if I happened to wake up early enough.

San Nicolas has co-ed floors (as opposed to San Miguel), so that was really nice. All of the residence halls except for San Rafael have washer/dryer rooms inside the building itself.

I'd say the most important thing is don't feel like you have to stick around with your floor just because they're there. I found a better floor that my friend was living on and I had a much better time there."
70761,best movies with a cool twist,"thanks for the advice, have never heard of those"
5471,best home improvement store,"Give Trust Hardware a shot too, always good to throw some dollars to locally owned businesses. The 24 hour availability is nice too because shit always goes wrong at night for some reason. 

https://www.trusthardwareonline.com/

Also they have shop dogs."
52939,best hiphop album,"Check out anyone produced by Madlib, MF Doom's full collection if you respect lyricism, Wutang Clan - Enter the 36 Chambers for sure. That's a good start at least too stoned to get list going"
