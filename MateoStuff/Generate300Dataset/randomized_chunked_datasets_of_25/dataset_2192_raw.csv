If you're going to act like a massive cocksucker fuck off. I don't give a shit if you don't like my taste in music. Do I need to spell that out in cheerios for you?

"When you’ve had your fill of cities I would suggest unwinding in my state, Montana. There are great camping opportunities, white water rafting, awesome national parks, sapphire hunting, archaeological digs, etc."
"[PBS Space Time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g) does astronomy and cosmology really well and has content going back to 2015. [PBS Eons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA) is great for evolutionary biology and geology.

[PBS Digital Studios](https://www.youtube.com/user/pbsdigitalstudios) has a bunch of other channels that are probably good."

They could outsource official training and support.  Larger companies will shell out a frankly disturbing amount of cash to get it from the source. As long as the third party people are fully trained and have a direct line to the creators it should work out perfectly without too much of a requirement of the creator's time.
CAn you explain the logic behind packaging everything? Especially stuff like fruits/ vegetables.
Yes.. That's what makes it a good twist. Even Stephen King agrees.
Gin and Tonic with a splash of Roses Lime. Ordering it sounds like you know what the fuck you are talking about and it's delicious.
"You need to come up with some supporting evidence.  The official story is of course that raw stock Chromium feeds Google and U/G mitigates that.  Your attempt to imply that U/G's mitigating countermeasures have failed to stop the leaks need some references.

Even a conspiracy theory carries more weight than what you've given because a conspiracy theory at least describes an unproven but plausible scenario.  You've not even hinted at what you believe U/G is leaking or why, much less supported it."

"Northern Michigan. Everyone from Michigan [and probably not] is more than likely going to laugh and down vote me into oblivion, but I was raised up near Traverse City Michigan and it can be seriously gorgeous at times. 

There's not a lot as far as clubbing and what not. But they have the bays, the bars and the booze. It's pretty nice up there. Not too many people, a lot of nice nature and good views."
"This may be an off hand suggestion buy *the girl with the dragon tattoo* has a bit if a twist to it (the 2011 version directed by David Fincher but the Swedish versions as well since they strayed from the books). 

Imagine being hired by a man to find out a killed his niece only to find out...... *spoilers ahead*

"I don't need to cherry pick articles, lean left is a generous description.  As to the medias take on foreign policy that generally has more to do with who is the commander-in-chief."

"i'm happy with www.mint.com

> The tricky part is finding an app where I can manually put in the weekly doctor appointments since the money it is cash, not a credit/debit transaction.

That should be easy to do in any budgeting app as a manual transaction."
"What has changed in HTTP since then?

Mature technology doesn’t always need constant updates. Fetch is really just some boilerplate wrapped around XHR."
"Practically everything I've ever heard about Chuck off the court has been complimentary.  I love the guy.

As a Jazz fan, it helps that he shows so much respect to Jerry Sloan and the Jazz organization.  So I might be a bit biased."
