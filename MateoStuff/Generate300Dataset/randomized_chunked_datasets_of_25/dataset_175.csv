36991,"Been going to Magic mountain a lot recently so I think I have some valuable input for you. For me the must rides at Magic Mountain are: 
Twisted Colossus - In my opinion the best ride at the park. Typically has a fast moving line since its usually running three trains.

X2 - This ride has mixed reviews but I personally think it's amazing. If you can ride back row inside seat. This thing has the best drop I've ever experienced and is just an insanely intense ride. Typically has the longest line in the park so keep that in mind. 

Full Throttle - short and sweet ride, super smooth and has some amazing hangtime on that loop. Also quite a unique ride. Can't go wrong with this one.

Tatsu - I've heard this is the best flying coaster. It's the only one I've ridden, but that Pretzel Loop is the single most intense moment I've ever experienced on a roller coaster and that alone is worth a ride. Personally I think a front row ride on this is the best. 

Lex Luthor Drop of Doom - Typically doesn't have too long of a wait and is the 2nd tallest drop tower in the world. They have VR on it right now and if you have a chance to experience it twice I'd recommend trying both. Personally for me it feels more intense with the VR but you have to try it without!

Revolution - pretty chill ride, but special to ride just for its historical significance.

Ninja - you have to do this one towards the front. I've ridden this ride a lot and the farther towards the back you get, the more tame the swinging tends to be. Front row on this thing is amazing. Surprisingly intense.

Riddler's Revenge - I tend to thing it's a little overrated but it is a fun ride that isn't super intense. From what I've heard it's one of the only bearable stand up coasters. It is pretty dang smooth, and it's the tallest and fastest stand up coaster, so probably worth a ride! 

Everything else:

Goliath - Honestly this thing is super overrated. It's fine, but it's nothing special. Offers little to no airtime, and the end offers pretty intense positive G forces, but it just isn't that enjoyable to  me.

Scream - An okay B&M, if you miss it you aren't missing much. Definitely has gotten a pretty noticeable B&M rattle over the years.

Batman - I love this ride, but it is a clone, so if you are short on time you can skip this if you've been on the other Batman clones.

Gold Rusher - a fun arrow mine train. I love old arrows so it's a must ride for me, but it isn't anything to crazy and can be skipped.

Superman Escape from Krypton - Not a super intense launch but it is a fun ride. If you sit in the front row (technically the back row since the car is backwards) you really get a sense of the speed of this thing. Your face begins to flap from the wind. If you had to choose between this and Lex Luthor I'd choose Lex.

Apocalypse: A fun GCI but it's pretty dang rough these days. Has a cool queue line though.

Green Lantern: Been closed for the past year or so and haven't seen much signs of it reopening. Super uncomfortable ride anyway.

Viper - an older arrow looper and tends to ride like one. I enjoy it but most people tend to stay away from it. As long as you lean your head forward you should be fine.

Justice League: If you've done any of the other ones you can skip this. It's slightly different but for the most part about the some. If you haven't, this thing is pretty awesome.",best roller coaster at six flags

I ended up getting a decent PC, love it, and am unlikely to get a PS5 anytime soon, if at all(having owned Playstations 1-4 previously). I will at some stage sell my PS4 (and Vita) and be console-less for the first time in years.  But  I'm more than OK with that.",best gaming system
