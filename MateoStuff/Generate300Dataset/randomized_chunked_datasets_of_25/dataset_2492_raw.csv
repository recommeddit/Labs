You just said that the i7-8700 is expensive for you. So I recommended a cheaper option.
Which instruments attract which personalities?
Get the dead space trilogy. Some of the best games on the console
Dan Marino hated this comment
Must be scientific - says so in the title
bandwidth is still terrible.  So people won't want or need high quality streams in video chats until their connections can handle it.
"Sunshine, City of God, Pan's Labyrinth (assuming you don't mind subtitles)."
240's are also great performing can for the money. +1
">look forward to more from him.

Them. James SA Corey is a pen name for a [duo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._A._Corey)

I didn't realize it until I finished Leviathan Wakes. One of them is also George Martin's protege"
"Yes. 

Use fluoride toothpaste. 

Especially now that people drink bottled water and other commercial drinks to a greater degree than in the past."
"Yup been reading through the sub, would be interesting to try out that motion control aiming. A lot of games I want for my switch but only have BotW which both it and the system were a gift and bought myself Celeste."
"Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett 

He is the one of the only ones that doesn’t toe the party line when doing the opposite is in his constituents’ best interests"
It looks like ballots get sent to players in November but voting happens until April. It’s been pretty clear that the voting is influenced by stuff like the SB.
"Balseiro hands down.

But you should have a solid foundation already. The entry exam is brutal."
"It does. It can also get a little trying at times, but it has some of the highest highs in fantasy so I think it's worth the ride."
"Came here to say this.

I don't put valuables in my hold luggage, I just stick a cable tie through the zips to stop accidental opening, discourage petty theft and check if my bags been inspected."
Why sooo lazy?
">I hate plus-size phones.

Me too. I was happy to jump from my 8 plus to the XR just to lose some bulk.

All I really want is an XS sized phone with XR battery life. Looks like the 11 Pro hits that mark more or less but I buy a new phone every other generation, so I'll probably get a 12 Pro I guess."
"In my opinion Tesla builds the best EV, but not the best car that is an EV. I've driven a Model S, which I was surprised that I didn't like, and a Model 3, which I loathed. I've sat in a Model Y which felt like it had the build quality of a Yugo, or at least what I imagine the build quality of a Yugo to be.

I want a car that feels like a car but happens to be an EV. I've had two Nissan Leafs and while they have their issues, everything is where I expect it to be and operates like I expect it to operate.

I'm intrigued by the Mach-E which seems like it might be a better EV than the Leaf and a better car than a Tesla."
"Find your favorite photo of them and you when you were a child and get a nice canvas print of it.  They probably have the best photos, so you'll have to be sneaky to get it from them.

If they're sciency and you've got cash, there's a National Geographic kit for $150 that traces your ancestry all the way back to Africa.  You have to pick the maternal or paternal line.  Your mom or dad swabs their cheek then mails it back in, and NatGeo provides a detailed report on your family's lineage.  I got this for my mom for Mother's day to trace our maternal line.  (Bonus on this one:  It's a present for you too) -- https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com

Are you crafty or artistic?  I'm short on cash this year, so I found a place that sells reclaimed wood from barns that were torn down.  I'm going to paint something for my parents to hang in their house.  They have everything they need, so I figured a hand-painted piece of old barn wood would matter more to them than some crap they already have."
"Watson attempted more passes and threw for more yards in the first half than he did in the second. The Texans actually didn't spend that much time in garbage time in 2020 - using the [handy filter on Ben Baldwin's website](https://rbsdm.com/stats/stats/), you can see that Watson still ran a similar amount of plays as everyone else. He also wasn't [top 5 in garbage time attempts](https://www.profootballnetwork.com/kirk-cousins-minnesota-vikings-and-the-kings-of-garbage-time/)."
