Isn’t that basically politics in general?

"Does anyone know which one is a good residential hall for a transfer student and how much would it cost me for a double or triple?

"The Top 100: NFL's Greatest Players from 2010 had him at 37.

The 100 anniversary team from 2019, that left the 100 players unranked, didn't have him among the members."
"This is why I love using an electronic toothbrush, because it has a timer on it. Some days it feels like I have been brushing for ages, yet it will be quite a while before the timer goes! So I know I would have 'cheated' if I was using a manual brush in that case."
Gives the feeling like That team played ALL of Cricket and now there is nothing worthy left to explore. They represent the epitome of a Cricket teams perfection and dominance. It’s all downhill from there...only the ruthless Australian team of 2000s comes remotely close in comparison.

"The progression is so weird in Wreckfest, the first two tournament tiers are the most difficult because the AI is a much better driver in a slow vehicle than it is in a fast one. Even if you kit your C-class whatever out to have a higher rating than everyone else on the track, it's still a restart scum fest sometimes because they hit the ideal line perfectly with zero wheel slip and catching up to that if you're behind or damaged is nearly impossible. Meanwhile the same AI in an A-class vehicle will wreck out and disqualify on lap 4 of 6 nearly every time because they can't stop flying into guardrails."

When I was a wrestler that song would always pump me up before a match!

"I wear L'Eau D'Issey Intense pretty much every day – very balanced fragrance, works for day and night I think. And shockingly affordable too."

"I am going to say you are a bold, but quiet. Venturing to guess that you are under 35 and are not from the United States. List seems more confident than a student, but bold enough to still be younger. You gravitate to earthy/spicy, so I would guess that you are outdoorsy, but you live in an urban area."

I have never understood the taboo on cash gifts; they are the best.
