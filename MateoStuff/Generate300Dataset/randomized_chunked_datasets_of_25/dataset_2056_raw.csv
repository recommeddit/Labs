I mean their only contenders are their earliest works as well
"I hear a lot of people say HD is cheaper, but in my experience Lowe’s almost always charges less for the same item. Maybe that’s just in Canada? I do, however, appreciate that the HD website will tell me exactly what aisle and bin an item is in. At Lowe’s I’ll walk through the store several times sometimes before I find an item if I’m not sure what department it should be in."
"Lowe's is shit. Absolutely shit. Don't bother with any of them, especially the one in Glendale (off Keystone). 

We've been using Menard's for all reno supplies. Keep in mind though, that everything is on short supply due to supply chain issues, pandemic demand, and time of year."
"Very true! 

I'm 46 and live in a small town of 10000 people.  I'm not management, I work for the Town council and  I don't have any kids, hence the frag collection."
"Remember to buy a cologne that you actually think smells good also, nobody's going to be smelling it more than you. Well maybe that's not true considering you'll probably get used to it but you're definitely going to smell it every single morning when you put it on, and I've definitely came across the cologne so that make me wonder how in the F people actually want to buy it, let alone smell it"
Never knew that. Thanks for filling me in.
"Mint sends me a ""Weekly Update"" email that gives me a breakdown of my spending for the week. 

It's a really great program, and I recommend it highly. I don't have the app on my phone so I can't speak to that, but the UI of the desktop version is really easy to use and looks nice. 

I tried YNAB, but found it to be much more labor intensive and also...ugly? Which I understand is a dumb reason not to like it, but Mint just seems much friendlier."
It was difficult to take the plunge but I have several DT socks now. No more worrying! Do you use a de-pilling stone or electric?
You can [buy just the marshmallows online](http://www.cerealmarshmallows.com/ordernow.aspx) (although I don't know if the website's trustworthy or not.
"Thanks for this. But your info about Red Pocket Mobile Family Plan are not updated. They offer a family plan up to 5 sims with 10GB of LTE data each and then controlled speed, which is actually pretty convient, as you have 5 lines for 110$ with 10Gb LTE each..."
"I have no IDE-A...... Sorry, can't help it."
"I met Danny Trejo at a bar one time. He was hilarious and cracked jokes with us. He also made fun of Johnny Depp. Rick Flair ""wooed!"" while he was at the urinal next to me. I bumped into RJ Mitte, and I'm glad I didn't knock him over.  I once almost ran over Antonio Daniels and what I assume was his family. Oops. Tim Duncan was brief, but very polite. All the guys from Dredg are super nice."
"Luckily I have Menards and Lowes 15 minutes away.  BTW Lowes will honor Menards 11% off sales, so will Home Depot.  For little stuff, I go to a Farm and Fleet, 3 minutes away.   Other times I will order off of Amazon if the pricing is better."
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint. He’s gaining on you.
that's no encouragement at all.
"Known to at least some of hotel's employees, not necessarily public."
"AliExpress. I don't like spending more than $50 on sunglasses. KnockAround is reputable but since I mess up/lose them, and even shitty quality sunglasses have UV protection since it's very cheap to apply, I'll go with AliExpress. Shipping from China takes a while but they work. Black wayfarers are the way to go for me, this stuff is like $5-20 and the selection is imo better than what's available on Amazon Canada or the US. I have a small face so it also lets me be selective with size (like a 52mm lens instead of 54 or 55).

Not sure if Ariana Grande’s perfumes count as they range from 22-60 ish? But I got Sweet Like Candy as a gift and it’s been growing on me. I know a lot of people say it smells immature and childlike but it gives me middle/high school nostalgia vibes. I feel like if I was 15 and owned it at the time I would’ve been obsessed.
I'd say that escalated immediately.
The hand model?

"Better ANC, yes. Sounds better? Maybe if you like bass that completely veils and colors the mids, especially with the XM3s.

If that's your sound signature, go for it.

The Sennheiser M3 Wireless has punchy bass but far more detailed mids and less grainy treble than the XM3/XM4. It's not even close."

Cheapest place found for lightening wire and hardware. Their support is fantastic if you have any questions or need help finding a part.


Cb2 and build count as little known....?"
"ebay.  there's a lot of them out there.  I picked up a 7 stage system, with tank, tap, TDS meter, etc.  $130ish, and my TDS is 0 to 2 PPM."
