I haven't heard of this one til now. What do you love about it?

India. Get lost in infinity.

"I've always thought this was a hard question to answer, so I eventually boiled it down to what sort of *experience* I had in the theater, when I first saw it. Pure adrenaline. Pure thrills. Had me just grinning from ear to ear. And that experience has only happened to me, at that level, maybe 3-4 times.

First was *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. Unsurprising.

That feeling happened to me again when I saw *Die Hard* for the first time. Only time I ever turned right around, bought a ticket and walked back in to see it again.

Third time was *The Mask of Zorro*. That turned it into a 3-way tie that lasted a very, very long time.

Recently, it happened with *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Mad Max: Fury Road*, so very high marks and honorable mention for each of them."
"I’ve never even thought of that but that would be awesome, if anything just so you can say you’ve smelled them (something like Fracas for example which, most people nowadays probably wouldn’t wear, but if you’re into fragrances it’s like essential sniffing)"
