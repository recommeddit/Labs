40799,best instrument to play,"Piano.  Definitely.  But you should try to find a practice room if you're in college.  Get yourself some basic method books and just go to a practice room for an hour every day or so, and you can buy a keyboard yourself when you feel ready for it."
12725,best gifts for mom,"My mom is always happy with gift cards to that one restaurant that's a little too nice to be spending your own budget money on but not so nice that it's uncomfortable. You know, those mid-nice places. That way she can treat herself a couple times throughout the year with her husband or friends guilt-free. 

She's also a flower/gardening nut and our local florists are at my best guess dead inside so I'm flirting with the Bloomsy Box, but I think that will be next year. I'm getting my parents an Echo to scream at and while they're getting used to it I want no more water-filled items near it on the table than necessary."
