16712,best pet for toddlers,A friend of mine adopted a shelter dog and it bit her child in the face... not always the best idea for a first dog especially with young children. It‚Äôs not as ‚Äúethical‚Äù but just buying a puppy is so much safer for the kid
44585,best items under $100,"I got ordained online like 5 1/2 years ago and have since done around 15 weddings. I'm not sure why, but people just started asking me to officiate their weddings and it kind of took off. Not ""life changing"" per se, but it has opened some doors for a side hustle, and i fucking love going to weddings. 

Also it's free"
39185,best web browser,"I always install Firefox but I never use it, do you feel it better or smoother than chrome?"
71487,best movies with a cool twist,I feel like I'm one of the only people that enjoyed The Village.
68342,best science fiction novel,""" a million deaths were not enough for Yueh"" - a child's history by Princess Irulan"
54406,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I found the artisans jarring. My wide screen or half screen flicks in valorant / cs were fine. But the micro adjustments during pistol rounds or spray transfers was like holding a high pressure fire hose on my own with one finger. üòÇ

I did eventually get used to it but ultimately went back to slower pads. That control when shit hits the fan and you need to spray transfer a 3rd guy with 3-4 bullets left is just too nice."
11110,best backpack for college,[L.L. Bean Guarantee is nice too.](http://www.llbean.com/customerService/aboutLLBean/guaranteed_popup.html)
72469,best keyboard switches,Another switch I liked were Box Blacks but the lure of clickies drew me back
47793,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,Probably not. You can usually get those crazy calculators fairly discounted. Try craigslist or any resale sites or apps
53264,best usb c charging cable,"I've found this particular cable to be exceptional relative to Apple's other cables.  I haven't been really happy with any of the other USB-C charging cables I've tried, but the Apple cable has been bombproof.

It's worth noting that a laptop power cable isn't typically subject to nearly the same abuse as a phone cable as laptops aren't really moved around that much while charging, and with the detachable cable, wrapping it around the charging brick is no longer a source of strain.  The cable itself is also a bit thicker which helps with strain relief.  

I don't know why you got downvoted so hard here."
31057,best country to live in,"I agree, this does seem possible."
9112,best toothpaste,"Oh my god Sensodyne. One night I fell asleep with a pair of those teeth whitening strips on for a few hours. The pain the next morning was indescribable.  

You know that feeling of pain you get when you bite into a huge scoop of ice cream? That horrible cold, electric discomfort? Amp that up by 10. I couldn't talk because when I would suck in a breath the pain intensified. I was pretty much in tears at work.

I took a co worker's advice and got Sensodyne and was basically brushing my teeth every 30 minutes. and spitting into a trashcan by my desk.

 It temporarily took away the pain. It was amazing."
16579,best pet for toddlers,"Rats are great pets. They‚Äôre sweet and easy to train. You need at least two though, since they‚Äôre social animals. I had several a few years ago and I miss them desperately."
14963,best romantic novel,"Nothing, I hope - I hated that book.  It falls into that so-common pattern where the female protagonist is supposed to be smart and tough, but she does weak and bloody stupid stuff over and over again.

We're in the minority on this one, though.  Most of my friends loved it, so I have wincingly recommended it to others."
30823,best country to live in,Ireland.
67799,axios alternatives reddit,i just use http
40463,best midrange GPU,I'd look into a used gtx 1080 then because there are some good priced ones under $300 and that gpu performs the same as a 2070. The good thing about the 30 series cards are all the pascal cards are becoming really cheap so if I were you i'd get a gtx 1070 or 1080. gtx 1070= gtx 1660 ti and 1080= rtx 2070.
46419,best trick or treating candy,"This year I'm bringing back the trick aspect. For every 2 full size candy bars i give out, I'm giving a rock to the third kid."
31459,best country to live in,North Korea
21592,best winnie the pooh comic,"My friend Robert is addicted to heroin, my friend Timmy shoplifts, my cousin Margaret hooks for a living and this one kid I go to school with *isn't white*.

6798,best iPhone,I really like my 11 Pro Max
32255,best hotel to live in,It was your comment that made me realize my dumb ass was thinking windows
38147,best Marvel movie,Hahaha. Arguing on the internet is the only thing passing the time for me in lockdown. I mean as long as people realize we're arguing on the internet and remain respectful which you're clearly being. I like people that feel passionately about movies even if they disagree. And the important thing to remember is that we can all agree on one simple truth: Hulk sucks. (Just his standalone movie. I enjoy Ruffalo much more especially in Ragnarok and Endgame.)
