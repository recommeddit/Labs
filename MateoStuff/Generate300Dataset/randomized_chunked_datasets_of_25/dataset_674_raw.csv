I am aware there isn't a lot of money in anthropology but at the time I assumed university meant guaranteed good job (I was naive at the time) thats why I'm going into a different program and not sticking with Anthropology when I graduate
Again missing the entire point
Thank you for adding a link to actually look at the place!
"Potassium Nitrate

They put it in toothpastes for sensitive teeth along with higher amounts of sodium fluoride.  From Sensodyne: Potassium Nitrate 5% (for antihypersensitivity), Sodium fluoride 0.13% w/v fluoride ion (for anticavity)."
"I have a pair as well, comfortable and generally a nice pair of sunglasses."
"It really is what you are looking for. There are a million. It would help to know ages of who is going, interest, looking to party?, want really quiet?, is beach use important? vibrant pool needed? Different resorts cater to different folks."
"Dasani, I would rather drink Toilet water"
"Unfortunately brady is first 

But for the older generations Namath has to atleast be top 20"
Immune is a newer podcast by Vincent Racaniello. Pretty good podcast from what I’ve been listening to. Focuses on immunology and new discoveries in human and animal models.
I believe Witcher 3 is $15 at the moment which will most likely be the most common answer you'll get as well
What he said.
"Beh, bad article. Doesn't really go into details why thing are ""better"" or ""more secure"". It might be good, but the way this is written seems like 'my-favorite-tool' fandom.

1. The automatic JSON transformation hides information. What if I want to get the HTTP headers, cookies, redirect information or read the status code? The response object has valuable information. This should be explicit asked for.

2. What is the XSRF protection? How does it work ""being better""? Doesn't this need support on the server side?

3. The implicit automatic error handling isn't usefull perse. With REST non-200-ok status codes might mean something for your app. This should also be asked for explicitly.

4. Globally defined interceptors are bad. Globals are bad. Just chain a transform function into your promise chain or create a factory function.

5. Progress info is pretty cool actually.

6. IE8 support is not that valuable, and in most cases these days the app itself doesn't even support IE8 (or IE9, or IE10) so this support wastes bytes for unused features. If this is really important it should be an optional addon/plugin.

And the slammer: 

> *It’s final* and the axios versus node-fetch debate is over. You’re now a well informed GET/POST and request/response master, so *do your thang*. 

I feel the author lacks experience (but compensates on enthusiasm)."
That's awesome! I hope you enjoy it! I'm enjoying the fact that this thread has turned into a bit of a love fest for *A Fire Upon the Deep*.
Thank you
Die for my bitch got to many your not wrong ! What do you think of hooligan?
the crusades are pretty badass
Back in 2004 my mom took me on a trip to LA to do some shopping for my 13th birthday. We went to Rodeo Drive just to look around at all the fancy stores and when we popped into Louis Vuitton I saw Nicky Hilton along with her body guard. Now being a teenage girl in the early 2000’s I absolutely loved the Hilton sisters and Nicole Richie. I went up to her and asked if I could get a picture with her and she said yes! My mom got out the camera to take a picture when the sales staff came running over telling us we couldn’t take pictures inside the store. I was pretty bummed. Nicky then asked me if I’d like to go outside and take a picture with her. I was so excited she dropped everything just to go outside and take a picture with me! We take the picture and talk with her for a few minutes before going our separate ways. She was so kind and very soft spoken. Nothing like you’d read about her and Paris in the tabloids. It made my birthday for sure!
For me it’s the Neo citron for cold extra strength night time honey lemon tea.
"A guy I know is currently getting his degree in ""African American Studies"". I don't have any idea what he could possibly do with that besides maybe teach a class on African American studies. 

Also he is the whitest person I know."

"I use a ZeroWater. I live alone but I go through a lot of water to keep my three rabbits going.

So what I do is I filter it first through a cheaper filter then re-filter the ZW to keep their filter going longer. Pur doesn't do a good enough job of filtering by itself."
Thanks for this. Just looked up and had all of the ingredients in my pantry - used apples instead of blueberries. Took about 5 mins to prep and its in the oven!
"I don't own a bike. I just hate liars.

You got caught out and now all you can do is slag."
"I can barely hear mine on speaker if there is any ambient noise. The earpiece is the same, if not worse. I use a Bluetooth headset 90% of the time, though, so it doesn't usually bother me. It tends to depend on the case, though."
It’s all about the hollandaise sauce. It’s hard to get it just right.
