65158,"I donâ€™t understand anyone who thinks ATT is in the running for the best spot. Its coverage is no better than either of the others and its business practices are just horrible.

Verizonâ€™s business practices are shit but it at least has the best coverage to make up for it.

Their coverage is not as good as Verizon though not nearly as far behind as they were a decade ago. If you spend most of your time in cities like I do, t-mo is a no brainer.",best phone service company
