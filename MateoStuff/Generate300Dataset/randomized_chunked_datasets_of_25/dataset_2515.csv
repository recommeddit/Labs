22783,best celebrity,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He was walking out of the restroom at my work place. I commented, ""I smelled what The Rock was cooking"" as we passed each other in the hallway. He turned back and gave me the [People's Eyebrow](http://gifsoup.com/view/3738992/the-people-s-eyebrow.html). Actually got to chat with him a little while, and led him to the edit bay that he was looking for."
12935,best gifts for mom,"or if you already bought a 2.0 model,[ this company](http://www.gourmet-coffee.com/Keurig-DRM-Freedom-Clip.html) makes a clip that 'hacks' it so that you can use any k-cup with it."
43667,best items under $100,Are you sure she's not a well designed AI humanoid? I heard ok cupid is full of them.
65158,best phone service company,"I donâ€™t understand anyone who thinks ATT is in the running for the best spot. Its coverage is no better than either of the others and its business practices are just horrible.

Verizonâ€™s business practices are shit but it at least has the best coverage to make up for it.

T-Mo is the best company to deal with by a mile and when you have signal, itâ€™s usually good signal (faster). Their coverage is not as good as Verizon though not nearly as far behind as they were a decade ago. If you spend most of your time in cities like I do, t-mo is a no brainer."

23432,best car racing video game,"Did the same as a kid, turns out you can basically max the specs on the starter miata so it's as good or better than anything else you get later in the game."
30469,best Mexican war to study,The [War of the Roses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses). That thing is confusing as hell. Bonus: Final Fantasy Tactics is based on it. The remake is even called Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions.
32474,best vacation resort,"In Scandinavia and island countries up North it's very expensive, a bottle of decent beer (were talking like domestic, nothing fancy) would be around $8-10USD at the cheaper places. I didn't even bother going to the nice places. They often had ""uni specials"" where you would get 5 shots for 100kroner (about 3.5USD each), which was the cheapest way I found any sort of drink at a bar. Thats why so much pre-drinking, and drinking on way since they don't care if you drink on the streets and such."
