"Having watched the Accented Cinema Tony Leung video before watching Shang Chi, I could tell the stark difference in acting chops between Tony and Simu. 

Simu was very stoned faced in acting but Tony was able to express multiple emotions from just his facial expressions alone."

"In the 1950s, it wasn't unusual for teams to bowl up to 125 8-ball overs in a day.

In the 80s, the WIndies in particular were bowling 72 6-ball overs in a day.

I think the record for least overs in an uninterrupted day in the late 80s was by England who bowled 68 overs *with 2 spinners bowling the whole day.*

The ICC took action and introduced the 90 over per day minimum. This is part of the reason for the lower number of draws - more cricket was played per test."
Uruguay should be #5
"She is definitely one of the best. After the horrible fires in Gatlinburg , she personally saw that every family got financial assistance. Terrific lady and a great talent as well."
"Bananatag. It tracks emails you send via Gmail.

I work from home and freelance. I cold email people or send finished projects...etc.

I used always be in the dark of whether or not people had gotten my emails or checked out what I sent...etc.

With Bananatag I can see when they opened it, which links they clicked, how many times they opened it...etc.

Now if I don't get a response in a couple of days but I know for a FACT they opened the damn email and clicked the links or opened the attached I feel much more justified in a follow up.

Sometimes I will see someone open my email...reopen it....re-re-open it over the course of a couple of days and know they must be on the fence.

Or I can see when someone opens an email convo we had like...8 months ago. So maybe I should reconnect with that person..etc.

**EDIT** I am genuinely surprised how many people seem to be ignorant about email tracking that has been around for nearly 2 decades.

Every type of marketing email uses it. You could go get a simple service like Aweber and use it or Mailchimp.

This extension simply eliminates the need for specific software and lets you track directly from Gmail, which is good for casual daily use and correspondence beyond large email campaigns.

**EDIT 2** Gmail doesn't block this guys. No email I know of does (although I am sure there are some).

I can see what email client the recipient is using....what operating system they are on....what device they are on...what time they opened it...how long they read...how many times they opened...how many times they clicked links...who they forwarded it to...etc.

And I see when Bob using an outdated Android OS opens up my email via Gmail on his phone at 3:52 am in Baltimore, Maryland."

"It sounds right to me too.  You can thank the Japanese critics.  It got 7 votes in [this poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6z2spq/top_anime_and_anime_directors_voted_by_japanese/) (although even without this poll, it still would've been in the top 5)."
"I have an extract of brandy butter I think. That would be a good thing to try in. Never had this flavour. 
Pomegranate gelato brownies must be a hell of a recipe to make ! And blueberry citrus must be refreshing! 

We had orange ice cream here when I was younger, than is was not “trendy” anymore and companies stopped making them.
Tried once, didn’t taste like the childhood memory! 

Durian ice cream... yuk never tired it, but I heard the smell is terrible"
It's been years since I read it but from what I recall The Mote in God's Eye has a great underlying concept and powers through largely based on that. It's an interesting read but Niven and Pournelle do really badly on (human) characterisation. Niven is pretty good on constructing believable aliens though – and I assume Niven was largely responsible for the portrayal of the Moties.
Trevor Noah: afraid of the dark was good. A lot of great names have been thrown out here but I feel like people should check out Trevor.

I will buy one bag a year for the express purposes of leaving on my desk for a few days as I eat it. It is mine and not to share.
"Yeah, like that Peter Russo guy"
"Cristino’s bakery, only the weekends between 11-2pm they serve birria and consommé and it is heavenly. Empty bowl is spectacular. Love Mesaburger. Also there’s a smaller tapas bar that’s the sister restaurant of milk&honey, called Alcazar. It’s smaller and more laid back, and they have music some nights. Definitely go to Bettina’s."

Be very happy with my Speck Candyshell. It's sturdy and has a nice raised lip to protect the screen when dropped.
"My list constantly changes but:

1. Infinity War
2. End Game
3. Civil War
4. Ragnarok 
5. Guardians of the Galaxy 
6. Far From Home
7. Black Panther
8. Winter Soldier
9. Iron Man
10. Avengers

Crazy to think we can do a top 10 list and more then half of the movies are left out."
"Wow, this is some extensive work. It seems to be a fairly accurate representation of ranking over a long period of time.

Looking forward to seeing more."
