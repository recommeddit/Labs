"> 7) Gilchrist - Only rival would be if Sanga was WK. Boucher and a few others could challenge as keeper alone, but no one else for WK/batting combo

Not even AB de Villiers? Sure, he doesn't have as high a strike-rate as Gilchrist, but I'm sure he could bat that quickly if necessary."
I'm happy to help!

"Dolphin has a neat integrated terminal. I just press F4 and it opens a tab with a CLI. If i need sudo, i just do it in the terminal. Since i do work with some backend and SSH, i am used to edit files with sudo on the terminal. It a matter of practice"

"The U.S Army was definitely well prepared for the war - it was woefully unprepared for the War of 1812 and suffered greatly as a result for the first two years of the war, but came out of it as a highly effective and professional force, and went into Mexico as one thirty years later."

"Dental nightmare here. I've been seeing my dentist every few weeks since I finally grew the balls to step up and get my shit fixed. 

We've gone over this quite a bit, because there are these wild toothpastes all over the world that are expensive and make crazy claims. (Especially in Japan, like holy shit, you can get a $300 tube of toothpaste that claims it rebuilds your teeth over there.) 

His answer is always, ""does it have flouride? Good. That's the one."" 

It can be one from Dollar Tree or some expensive one that promises to whiten your teeth in x amount of weeks. (It probably won't, and might have abrasive stuff in it that will do more harm than good.)

Also, worth noting, be extremely careful with foreign toothpastes. Most are pretty good, but some can have some really unsavory stuff in them. Imagine my surprise when I read a study done on a few brands of Indian toothpaste, and one I had used before, Colgate Herbal, was found to contain fucking nicotine. 

If anyone has any questions about general dentistry stuff and the mistakes you can make as a patient, i'll happily try and answer, and i'm sure my dentist would be receptive, too."
"I really like Moscow Mules (ginger beer, lime, vodka) and Mojitos (white rum, lime, mint). Both are very refreshing and light (and secretly have a good amount of sugar without tasting like it). Happy birthday!!"
"This is actually really important. Non-partisan polling indicates that atheists are viewed as less desirable in office than violent felons. 

Republicans would rather have a gay or muslim president than an atheist one, which is saying a lot."

I’m ashamed to say that I just had to look up My Lai after seeing this post... went to middle school through college in the US. Even my AP US History class didn’t cover it.

Oh man! Sand and Sable... That is a blast from the past. I'm telling you I would love to encounter a bottle of Seirra again. Just to have a sniff and be pile drived (??) by nostalgia.
I cannot recommend Steam World Heist enough. First and only game I’ve played on the iPad so far and it’s great.
I love my mini. It’s great having a phone that easily fits in my pocket again.
