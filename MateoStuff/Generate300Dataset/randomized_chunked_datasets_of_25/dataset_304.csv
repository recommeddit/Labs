19214,best YouTube video,His improv game is strong lol. Well done
29503,best game console,"I feel for you. I can't really give a logical explanation as to why I'd rank it higher than other greats like SotC, but I suppose it's because I value different things in game than the average gamer"
22224,best celebrity,"Read through all of these, you're the first to make me green with envy.  I'd love to meet that guy one day, he's one of the few progressive religious leaders out there (go read his comments on homosexuality for an example)."
24352,best anime,I'm glad to hear you like it.  I hope you find some interesting anime to watch.
17745,best Kardashian,"I’m confused as to why people are saying Kim. She stole $125,000 off her best friend, promoted appetite suppressing lolly pops, diarrhoea teas, and waist trainers to her young audience even though they’re dangerous products, feeds news stories to the press about her mentally ill husband, participated in bullying Jordyn woods, makes nasty comments to her sisters about their appearances, planned that god awful island party during the middle of the pandemic, openly has a favourite child and traded her children’s privacy for relevance. I guess her lawyer shtick has been a hell of a rebrand"
8878,best toothpaste,"Abrasive toothpastes are ones that contain Silicon Dioxide (aka quartz sand), hydroxyapatite, aluminium hydroxide or calcium carbonate. Pretty much all toothpastes contain some of these (although gels tend to have lower levels than chalky white toothpastes)."
16654,best pet for toddlers,"Have you tried putting a ledge near your door that your cat can hop up onto instead of darting out? Jackson Galaxy has some great tips about these situations.

Also, here's a helpful link. http://pawesomecats.com/2016/10/07/stop-door-darting-behaviour-in-cats/"
69278,best major to study in college,"I studied French in university and am now working in development. If I could go back I'd probably do Political Science. I was actually a double major for it, but dropped it because the intro classes were boring. I didn't have the patience to get to the more interesting, skill bearing classes later on. 

That being said I don't really regret French in any way. I studied what I loved, I kicked ass at it, and it's opened up a lot of really interesting opportunities since."
13683,best research paper archive,I feel like this should be printed in large text in every library in the world.
67705,axios alternatives reddit,"I think the point is that it's solving a problem that only exists in older browsers now, because fetch natively provides a pretty similar developer experience."

36018,best alcoholic drink,Electrolytes!
71772,best movies with a cool twist,Inception... A matter a fact most Chris Nolan films.
32595,best vacation resort,I know folks who also enjoyed Sandals for their October Honeymoon (at the Jamaica location).
73328,best Linux distro,"Coding (python)- Don't bother with Anaconda or anything, just get Spyder or PyCharm (I recommend the former). For other languages I've heard VSCode get recommended.

Photo editing- GIMP

Downloading youtube vids- `youtube-dl`

Text editing- whatever your desktop environment comes with will probably be fine, but if you want to learn how to edit text REAL fast, try out `vim` or `emacs`. 

Do you know how to install programs in a Linux distro? You do it usually through the terminal. Let me know when you've actually installed Linux and I can give you a short tutorial on how to do that."
59275,best perfume,The first time I smelled this I had to beg my friend to talk me out of spending over a hundred dollars on some smelly water.  Fuck me it's some good smelling water though
19526,best YouTube video,I love RedLetterMedia. Must watch if you like movies
31552,best hotel to live in,"Bürgenstock Alpine Spa if you’re into wellness.
If it’s ski season, Alpina Gstaad. Rumor has it they helicoptered in a Christmas tree to a suite since the tree a guest wanted was so large it didn’t fit through the hallways. If that’s not ultimate luxury, don’t know what is :) 

Where next?"
69636,best major to study in college,"Master's in psych here, this is a truth.  We hire a lot of psych BA-level people as care coordinators, but honestly, it's a crap job.  They get the hardest clients, the worst pay, and the least attractive tasks."
15049,best romantic novel,"“Will you be there?” by Guillaume Musso. 

Tragedy, time travel, tough decisions, the chance to redo something again. It’s not only about romantic love between a couple, but also friendships and parenthood.

Edit: Added details"
72562,best keyboard switches,"I use mx greens (very clicky, very heavy) but my hands have a tendency to click when I don't mean to click. I constantly right click my mouse inadvertently."
9319,best toothpaste,-drinks bleach-
26946,best board games,"A roomate and I went through like 80ish of the gloomhaven scenarios together, and in that period I was able to fit like maybe 5-6 TI4 games? It is totally feasible to play a few GH scenarios in one evening compared to TI."
28253,best breakfast foods,"Potatoes O'Brien (cubed potato with chopped onion and green bell pepper) with Mexican-style chorizo sausage and a fried egg on top. And a tall mug of black coffee. I eat breakfast after nearly an hour of strenuous exercise every morning, and that meal has to last me, so I go hearty. 

I start by removing the chorizo from the casing and cooking it in the skillet until it's about 3/4 done and remove it, reserving the oil. It's in that oil I fry up the potatoes O'Brien on high heat until they're crisp on the outside (usually with a bit of salt and pepper). I add the chorizo back in and cook an egg in another skillet, over easy so I can cut into it and the yolk gets everywhere. All told it's probably about 20 minutes of cooking, but it's well worth it. The flavors and textures are just so bold and go really well together. The chorizo has the spice, the savory, and the juice, the potatoes and veggies are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and the yolk just coats everything."
