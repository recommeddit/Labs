36915,best roller coaster at six flags,"I've been to SFDK most recently, and I enjoy it a lot. In the 80's and 90's I went to SFGAm and SFMM and they were both incredible parks, which seems to still continue today."

It's nice looking, fast, you can use a bunch of plugins and edit code just like on vim"
69771,best major to study in college,"While I agree that no degree will guarantee you a lucrative job, I think it's important to point out that not everyone has a field of interest that can be readily commercialized.  OP might love medieval poetry, but the reality is that there's not much market demand for people with expertise analyzing themes in 12th century literature.  At the end of the day, he has to weigh that interest against the possibility (or probability) that he'll not only have few job prospects at the end of those four years, but also have tens of thousands of dollars of debt.

I definitely don't think you should do something you hate, or in which you have no talent, but I do think that ""doing something you like"" needs to be tempered by an element of pragmatism.  As rough as engineering was sometimes, I think my adult life would have been even rougher had I gone the liberal arts route."

23398,best car racing video game,"The simulation and physics, not to mention audio, are so good that you'll have a hard time playing other ""sims"" like Forza Motorsport again, if you're looking for a proper sim experience that is.

That said, I'd only play it with a wheel. People do play with controllers but ultimately, it really was designed around a sim experience and thus designed primarily for wheels."
26178,best politician,"I've gotta go FDR. He guided the US through some of its darkest hours and his influence is still felt by Americans everyday. Granted, he did some shitty things, but his accomplishments were many and his political skills fascinate me. He also gave us Eleanor Roosevelt as First Lady, so bonus points for that. 

In my own lifetime it is easily Obama. He was the first politician I volunteered for, and the first to whom I made a financial contribution, so there's a sentimental factor for me. He's also eloquent, [legitimate] scandal free, and someone I've been proud to have represent us on the international stage. I particularly enjoy his sardonic sense of humor."
34703,best NFL player,"How do you define greatest?

 Some go by best overall, which would probably be Rice (more margin from Rice to 2nd best WR than any other major position)

Some go by legacy, which would be Montana or Brady with their playoff success combined with the aura about them (as in...when the game is on the line, who do you want with the ball) 

Others go by statistics, which would for now be Peyton Manning or Rice.

And some go by talent, which would be Rodgers OR young or Manning or anyone really."

73486,best battery bank,"Anker makes several 20,000 mAh, weighing 12 to 13 ounces. I once met a UL through hiker carrying TWO. This brings new meaning to UL."
67174,axios alternatives reddit,"I wonder why so many people still keep suggesting `axios` as a good http library.

For me `axios` is following `request` path and will soon be deprecated mainly because there are no maintainers ready to maintain it for ""free""

I mean ... you want ESM Support on Axios ? Sure, please pay **6k$** ([https://opencollective.com/axios#category-BUDGET](https://opencollective.com/axios#category-BUDGET)) and then you'll have it.

Besides that we can also point at the **93 PRs** still waiting reviews, so even if you want to help axios progress you wont be able to because of maintainers not even caring about others wanting to help them.

For me, not (or nearly not) maintaining a library just because youre not making money from it is not how opensource work and a  ""pay for feature"" kind of strategy is also not how opensource work for me.

That's why as of now i've switched all my projects from [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) because Sindresorhus is exactly the definition of an opensource maintainer and axios's maintainers are not.

Edit : Oh and i forgot but got is the [most complete http library](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#comparison) for node from a feature pov."
14668,best romantic novel,"I like romance, but I am sooooo incredibly picky about them that I probably can't even consider myself a romance reader. Actually, my favorites probably aren't even considered ""true"" romance, but what the heck. I'll try to think of more later, but probably my top two are Jane Eyre and The Time Traveler's Wife."
58896,best perfume,"I just watched Halston and I am now obsessed with smelling it. How would you describe it? also, do you get vintage or new bottles?"
