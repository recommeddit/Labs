29571,best game console,"Not to mention you can use Fanatec's wheel, pedals, and shifter.  It also has one of the best modeled clutches in any racing sim.  It was also pretty and had a good framerate.  FM4 was impressive."
17899,best Kardashian,"Kim is my fave cause at the end of the day she‚Äôs the reason we are all even here talking together. I appreciate how she‚Äôs always nice to fans and her activism. 

Kendall and Kourtney are my least favorite. I grew up with white girls exactly like them lol."
61686,Best RPG game on PS4,I really liked dragon age inquisition. Also the new God of War (although it's more of an arpg.) Persona 5 is definitely a good one too.
61567,Best RPG game on PS4,"an action game. it‚Äôs not really comparable to an RPG like, say, The Witcher 3. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
15723,best sunglasses for fashion,"Quality wise they're both very similar with Randolph perhaps having an edge, what separates them is the more design options that Randolph has.

11089,best backpack for college,"Backpacks aren't something I'd worry about the fashion over, I think messenger bags work well for the typical college student. I got one from Serbags for like $70 awhile back and it's been a great little thing to have, I never realized how nice it is to be able to access it without taking it off. 

Just travel light, wears on the shoulders more."
19760,best YouTube video,Every Michael Jackson grunt.
21935,best celebrity,"I checked John Mulaney into a hotel room once. He wanted to pay for someone else‚Äôs room so he was at my desk for like 5 minutes while I set that up. He‚Äôs a genuinely nice guy.
