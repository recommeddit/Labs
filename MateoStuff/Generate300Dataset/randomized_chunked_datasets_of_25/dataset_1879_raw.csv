"If I am being totally honest, Greg Egan would fill every spot. But that would be boring, so here's a list of books that influenced me when I read them, in no particular order and ignoring Egan:

Foundation Series

Speaker for the dead

Uplift Series

Rendezvous with Rama 

Childhoods end

Canticle for lebowitz 

Nightfall"
"Im really surprised how good the mobile version is, it's recommended if you like those sorts of games for sure."
I'm a bit dissapointed there's no nintendo system games there but some of those games I enjoyed playing before I ascended
"I heard most freshmen now don't call it FT. We called it FT almost all the time last year! But FT was awesome. Can't beat the social life, though!

Also, fuck portola."

Any estimates on the price for the lordstown truck? I keep forgetting it may exist.
Is this where we debate the non-flushable characteristics of flushable butt wipes?

"Garlic in your butt. Legitimately a clove just up there. Then a lot of water. Loads of honey and vitamin c. And rest. And BAM 
You get well."
"Haven't had one in a while but the last one I had lasted for maybe 3 years before the hinge broke and some of the keys and trackpad stopped working

Hard to recommend, but others I know are still using theirs after 5+ years, so YMMV"
Clearly the common denominator is vanilla
i think doolittle is better than exile on main street too
"Dyson Animal Cordless Vaccum.

"Yeah, Iâ€™m actually just leaning towards either fish or nothing at this point."
"Speaking of problems with the article...

> It is a terrible behavior for Fetch to receive a 500 status code from the server and treat it as 200.

That's not even true. People only get this idea because the promise doesn't automatically reject. Fetch behaves like this because it makes a distinction between a network error (the server can't be reached for whatever reason), and a completed request where the response happens to have an HTTP error code.

If you don't like that design regardless, you still have the option of rejecting when `!response.ok` or `response.status === 500`, etc."
I like that you're so decent. It's really refreshing to see amongst divorced people.
"The chart is updated! Added US Mobile's new plans and included the total cost estimate with all taxes & fees included. Please note this is based on what I'm seeing in Colorado, and it may vary by region."
I believe I paid under 30$usd for each.  The E & J's are small rollerball versions.

"Been there. Art school isnâ€™t cheap. If youâ€™re okay with being tens of thousands of dollars in debt for a degree that even if you complete wonâ€™t get you any closer to a job except office work, have at it but you can learn how to write without getting into debt for it. Find the writer communities where you live and go to workshops and read your ass off, learn to meditate and visualize imagery as hard as you can, and youâ€™ll be in the same boat as everyone who graduates minus the student loans."
"I wanna say percussion is not just rhythmic training lol itâ€™s a very wide range of instruments that all require different techniques. Drum set, snare drum, mallet keyboards, and timpani are all just as difficult to master as any given string or wind instrument. Shit even tamborine has advanced techniques that you canâ€™t just do without training. And if youâ€™re a percussionist you have to master all of them lol"
