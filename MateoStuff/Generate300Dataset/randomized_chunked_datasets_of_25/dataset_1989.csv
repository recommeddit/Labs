26070,"As someone who has the same values and beliefs as him, I believe he was recklessly divisive. He got wrapped up in the bravado of the other two and started promising things he couldn’t back up. 

For example, we both want free college. He acted as though reducing the cost of college wasn’t good enough, but didn’t acknowledge that congress would have blocked any tax reform that would allow that to actually happen. False promises are harmful, regardless of who says them. 

His supporters are overall higher educated than others, so I would like to believe that they could have handled the discussion in a less “scream your views at people until they agree with you” method. He frequently lost his cool, and modeled that for others. 

What’s frustrating is that I was a fan of his long before he ran, yet I spent half of the election arguing with people that should have agreed with me. People acted like he was above reproach, and no one is.",best politician

Many of the releases since have been ports of games I bought on Wii U. Also, the joycons are absolutely awful. Horrible, cheap joysticks that are way too inaccurate for FPS, Rocket League, etc. I've never been an Xbox guy and prefer those titles on my PC.",best gaming system
