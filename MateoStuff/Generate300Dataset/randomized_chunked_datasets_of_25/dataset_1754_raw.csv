Molecule 01 by Escentrics Molecules. It's a bit of a cult buy and I can never smell it on myself but it's the sort of thing where strangers passing by stop me to ask what it is!
"Current top 5 in no particular order:

-When a Scot Ties the Knot by Tessa Dare

-Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake by Sarah MacLean 

-The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang

-Fix Her Up by Tessa Bailey (although she does not seem to be well loved on this sub due to her use of “ baby/babygirl,” I thought this book was HOT and can’t wait to read more of her books)

-The Governess Affair by Courtney Milan"

"My dad was a firefighter.  When my wife and I bought our first house my dad gave us 6 fire extinguishers, a box of 9 volts, and a life ladder.  Man I miss that guy!"
They make note of the valuables inside when they x-ray it. You can have the worst looking bag in the world and they will still know.
"I loved Prisoners, favourite movie of 2013"
That guy’s house tho... oof the dream right there
"Exactly, and if you're chained up in a disgusting old bath house or something, you probably aren't going to be super focused on the guy with his brains spilling out."
"I wouldn't go that far personally. It's shortcomings are still a big deal, he's just the only thing that makes it a watchable show."
400 cad can get you a good mid-high range card. 5700 xt if you go used is probably the best you can get. 5600 xt or 2060 new
This. Fierce is my absolute favorite and never fails to get me going (and I don't even like cologne).
Or longer. My husband's cat lived to be at least 21 years old.
Strawberry
And I’d pay it again
"I originally was leaning towards brown switches but now I feel nervous because everyone claims red is superior for gaming. However, I'm going to be using this as an all-around keyboard but play things like Overwatch and League of Legends. As such, which should I go with?"
"Will have the UAG Monarch case for the phone. Have one for my current phone and it never failed on me, even tossed it to the ground in front of my co-workers on purpose when they questioned the protection it provided and came out 100% fine. Thought about getting the official leather case, but the UAG case just offers great protection and is only $10 more than the leather case."
"Best value?  Multiple beater Leafs.  Next up from there is a Fiat 500e

Edit: I take everything back.  Go with the Spark EV."
"I literally just got off tech support with Logitech about their garbage drivers that don’t save cam settings. I have a 20 and a 22. I definitely agree that the 22 has grainy video even with proper lighting. I’m currently experimenting with their other drivers, they recommended a separate one for each of my cams, instead of just using an aggregate driver.  I’ll let you know if it works, the not saving settings thing has been an absolute pain, but from what I can tell is not OBS’s fault, and rather is Logitech driver issues."
"My yet favourites in this order: 
1:Slay the Spire 
2:Moonlighter

6:Krumit’s Tale 
7:8 Ball Pool ( this one is a free game )"
"We made it into a drinking game where we’d drink every time they said family, or we saw family written.

Made it fun for a couple of times before we realized just drinking was even more fun."
Mechassault was a very god mech game. I suggest we add it to the list
"> You can just be playing the role of adventurer in a dungeon.

Playing a spreadsheet is not a role."
Hand sanitizer does nothing if your hands are covered in deadly iocane powder!
"Not quite what I meant. I live in Virginia near the Blue Ridge mountains and there are tons of national forests. There are a lot of jobs involving trail maintenance, plant/animal conservation, etc. that are more than simple trash pickup in a NYC park.

Pay isn't high, but cost of living tends to be pretty low in those areas."
