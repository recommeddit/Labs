57064,best water brand,I cant stand Dasani. It tastes like pool water
23770,best car racing video game,"Colin McRae Rally 2.0 still holds the crown after all these years, but Forza Horizon 3 comes pretty close, abysmal port aside. Burnout 3 is amazing as well, but no PC version :[[[[[[

Test Drive 5 also holds a special place in my heart, but only because it was my first racing game and the  soundtrack was *dark as fuck*."
54513,best artisan mousepad alternatives,Sorry search for @IsArtisan
15467,best tree for the garden,"I typically mix sulphur powder or aluminum sulphate into the hole, mix more in as I backfill, and add more around the planting area. It's usually enough after rain soaks it in, but it's simple enough to add more every year or two. And yeah, if people don't ever water that is a problem, but after a couple years I've never had one die, even in heavy, exposed, drought-tolerant clay."
42065,movies like Inception,"Idk if anyone else has recommended it, I saw someone say the first blade runner but I wanted to recommended blade runner 2049, great film that touches on some deep subjects and has a similar scale to the film's you listed, in terms of score and fx and story.

Plus it's directed by Denis Vileneuve (hope I spelled that right) who directed Arrival."

56742,best desktop monitor,"It doesn't support Vesa from the factory, however adapters are available from Amazon and the like."
65996,best college in california,"Different sets of metrics. Undergrad prioritizes things like # of applicants, which UCLA wins on."
59535,best perfume,"1. Age-24
2. Personality-Cheeky. Flirtacious, playful, memorable. I feel you like to have a good time, go to parties and such. I feel on the surface you're very outgoing and friendly, but you have a different side that only a few people get go see. 
3. Favorite genre of perfume. Gourmand. Caramel notes.
4.Occupation: sales/marketing"
56475,best desktop monitor,"I have two AW2721D’s. Went through 8 various LG Ultrawide 38s, and the AW3821, used to have a PG279q.  I’m a photo editor as well as gamer and I am extremely particular about my monitors.  The AW2721d was the only one I found with perfect panel uniformity, hardly any backlight bleed (considering it’s an IPS), and good enough contrast for editing photos.  While also having 240hz + 1440p, it’s a huge win imo.  I wouldn’t buy any other monitor at this point in time.  Although it might be worth waiting for that PG279QM that’s coming out soon."
46655,best trick or treating candy,Louisiana here..... sounds about right.
70523,best major to study in college,"English: 

Best: I don't have to do math or memorize rules - it's mostly based on interpretation and discussion.

Worst: Everyone likes to brag about the ridiculously obscure books they've read - turns into a literary pissing contest."
61799,Best RPG game on PS4,/r/gamingcirclejerk
39930,best Chrome extensions,"Sometimes you’re interested in something and want to ask Reddit about it. But if you had this and it was already said, you could just read it"
73332,best Linux distro,"By that I mean ""apps that an average user uses on a daily basis"" like spotify and discord , which you can already download on Linux."
33947,best Pokemon game,"It's tough to say from a purely objective standpoint without adding a bunch of personal preference. I personally say yellow,(best of the first gen, doesn't matter what anyone else says) but that's because I played it when I was a kid. It's still fun to play, but the nostalgia factor is what really puts it over the moon for me. But for anyone who's never played pokemon its gonna feel pretty outdated. I've played some of the newer games too (if you want to think of pokemon black from 8 years ago as new) and I could just never get into it the same way. Felt kind of...clunky, for lack of a better term. Just didnt feel like a pokemon game to me for some reason. Might just be because I'm an old fuddy fuddy these days though. Honestly I'd say your best bet is to start with gen 3 (or whatever gen Ruby/Saphire/Emerald is) and go from there.  For me personally these games still retain whatever it is that  makes a pokemon game a pokemon game, but with some relatively modern features that make it feel not quite so outdated. Honestly whatever you decide any pokemon is pretty fun. Not Go though. Dont do that.
Also get an n64 emulator and get pokemon stadium  and snap. Two of the best mon games ever created."
55710,best action and adventure novel series,"John Ringo's 'A hyme before battle', iirc it's a series called 'the posleen wars.'  Earth being invaded by centaur-like aliens and the military gets fantastic tech (read: mechsuits) from other alien civilizations to stave off the invasion. The books reads like reports from military-campaigns with some interstellar politicking thrown in for good measure."
18343,best YouTube video,I have watched the god-anime video probably 50 times at this point and I still laugh every time.
24165,best anime,"The Pet Girl of Sakurasou - Similar to Toradora!

Toradora! - One of the best romcom. Would consider one of the standards in that genre.

Angel Beats! - the feels man. they hurt.

Darker Than Black (both seasons) - lots of action, dark themes

Fate Zero - more serious moral themes. 

Guilty Crown - Amazing sound track for the series. Not sure why it gets SO MUCH HATE. I honestly thought it 
was a good anime. 

Isshuukan Friends - Don't see this one mentioned very often so i had to add it. Very light hearted warm romance. Found myself rooting for the MC multiple times."
52414,best hiphop album,"Hi it's not accurate. but those are good albums. madvilliany and endtroducing are definitely not top 10 albums of all time but that doesn't take away the classic album status. kendrick bring on there twice is laughable but those are great albums., I'm dad."
71436,best movies with a cool twist,Which is saying something. King hates his movies.
5374,best home improvement store,Zoro.com for pipes and switches and materials for projects.
