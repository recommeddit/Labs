"> F) Don't bring shit you don't want to lose. Unless you are sure your hotel has a safe, it could be stolen. I've had shit stolen in 5 star hotels, so just assume it's going to grow legs, unless it is in a safe or on your body.

One issue with many hotels is that the locks they have in your room still have the default master password/number."
So important. No camera even the c920s looks good in darkness
Dogwoods are nice. Japanese maple come in different shapes sizes and colors. Great in all conditions. My personal favorite. Wouldnt go with Chinese hackleberry. Some type of oak.  Or citrus tree fruit producing.

As i mentioned, unfortunately i can not test xournal++ with MacOS.

Your idea with running it without root looks promising. Did you think to give feedback on their github page (issues)? Maybe they can make the app better with your input:)

"The problem with doing only a top 100 listing is that it would be even more affected by the exact methodology used to generate the list. 

And the methodology for university listings is always more than questionable. For instance most listings based on university reputation say more about the university's position in previous rankings (favoring mostly us and UK universities) or about how impressive a university's name is (favoring ""University of [country name]"" and ""University of [capital city]"") than about the actual quality of the university. 

But including the top 1000 you can at least reduce this to the point where you can say that the list includes a reasonable fraction of all top universities in the world, without having to go into too much detail about whether ""university of A"" is better than ""B university""."
I’m pretty sure that was a terrorist training video.

"It's there! It's called ""AT&T Prepaid 8GB Annual"" and in row 116 in the ""All Plans"" view. $25/mo for 8GB is a pretty good deal on the AT&T network."
