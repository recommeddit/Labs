495,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"* My university distributed Wacom tablets. I didn't seek it out

* If I could use it to annotate PDFs I would slightly prefer it to the iPad for use during Zoom lectures, because I wouldn't have to juggle an additional screen, or deal with the various issues I've encountered with having to continually switch host back and forth to the iPad or problems with Airplay. I also wouldn't have to worry about accidentally marking up my primary lecture material on my iPad."

24009,best anime,"Ha, yes! We really do have similar tastes; Cromartie HS and Gin no Saji have been on my PTW for quite a while. I've watched several episodes of both; but you know how it is...there's a ridiculous backflow of things to watch and all of a sudden you realize you didn't finish what you meant to and watched other things you didn't plan...but I shall return and rectify this immediately!"

28162,best breakfast foods,"It's like soy sauce, but I think it tastes a lot better. Don't need much either. We switched to Maggi about 8 years ago.

Fried egg on rice with Maggi is a favorite breakfast here too and we're not Asian."

73319,best Linux distro,"If you are going to install Linux on a laptop that you are going to buy, make sure you **don't** buy a Windows laptop. By the way Lenovo sell [Linux laptops](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/linux-laptops-desktops/?visibleDatas=857%3A14%22%20-%2014.9%22%2C15%22%20-%2016.9%22) and you can replace the distro afterward. 

For the Distro, I recommend Linux Mint Cinnamon or Pop!\_OS."

69731,best major to study in college,"It really depends on what your goals are for your education, your career, and your life in general."
4015,best online college,"Phoenix. I work in software, there are plenty of self-educated people in software who point to cool things they have built when someone doubts their education. I would say 80% of what I know I learned independently. The school work was very easy - if you ever got tutored in a subject to get ahead (as opposed to catch up) you know what I mean - when you're far enough ahead every thing you write/type is as easy and natural as name and date.

I really enjoyed this arrangement, I read a lot of great books on the topics of my classes and played around with every language and tool we were using, and more. I also worked, a lot, to support myself and to pay for school. I didn't end up building anything cool enough to be proud of on my resume while in school, but my internship (not school-related) turned into my first real job at a very cool company after I finished school. In effect all I got from school was a shove into some aspects of my field that I thought were lame and boring (some things take a few years to grow on you, like your parents and writing documentation) and a piece of paper that doubled my hours, my pay, and gave me benefits.

I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANY FIELD BESIDES SOFTWARE

I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANYONE BESIDES THE SELF-MOTIVATED

If you're not all of the above, forget my happy outcome and read some other responses.

*EDIT:* I really have to re-state, in CompSci you can learn and practice everything with a computer and an internet connection. I can't think of another field where this applies. I wanted to finish college because:

1. Sitting down and learning a subject without a guide is hard.

2. I didn't really believe I could get hired as a self-taught person.

If you are in the same situation as me, I would advise:

1. Take free CS courses from MIT, Harvard, and all the other amazing universities that offer them. One of them actually offers a degree (with lots of asterisks) now.

2. Find people who want to collaborate on cool things. Small cool things. Things you think you could finish in a 20-hour day. (You will learn a hard truth that you've always thought didn't apply to you.)"
