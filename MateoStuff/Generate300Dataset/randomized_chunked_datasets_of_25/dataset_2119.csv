4015,"Phoenix. I work in software, there are plenty of self-educated people in software who point to cool things they have built when someone doubts their education. I would say 80% of what I know I learned independently. The school work was very easy - if you ever got tutored in a subject to get ahead (as opposed to catch up) you know what I mean - when you're far enough ahead every thing you write/type is as easy and natural as name and date.

I really enjoyed this arrangement, I read a lot of great books on the topics of my classes and played around with every language and tool we were using, and more. I also worked, a lot, to support myself and to pay for school. I didn't end up building anything cool enough to be proud of on my resume while in school, but my internship (not school-related) turned into my first real job at a very cool company after I finished school. In effect all I got from school was a shove into some aspects of my field that I thought were lame and boring (some things take a few years to grow on you, like your parents and writing documentation) and a piece of paper that doubled my hours, my pay, and gave me benefits.

I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANY FIELD BESIDES SOFTWARE

I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ANYONE BESIDES THE SELF-MOTIVATED

If you're not all of the above, forget my happy outcome and read some other responses.

*EDIT:* I really have to re-state, in CompSci you can learn and practice everything with a computer and an internet connection. I can't think of another field where this applies. I wanted to finish college because:

1. Sitting down and learning a subject without a guide is hard.

2. I didn't really believe I could get hired as a self-taught person.

If you are in the same situation as me, I would advise:

1. Take free CS courses from MIT, Harvard, and all the other amazing universities that offer them. One of them actually offers a degree (with lots of asterisks) now.

2. Find people who want to collaborate on cool things. Small cool things. Things you think you could finish in a 20-hour day. (You will learn a hard truth that you've always thought didn't apply to you.)",best online college
