9006,best toothpaste,"just because it's listed as inactive doesn't mean it doesn't so anything.  they just aren't making any claims to its effectiveness.  I've been using Burt's Bees whitening for a few weeks and my sensitivity is way, way down.  Better than any sensitivity toothpaste i've ever tried in that respect."
26534,best board games,"I thought about that as well but did not go that far. I don't really think you need a stepping stone to Pandemic, it is still the best gateway coop game imho. Haven't played Concordia or Clank! So can't speak for them."
37537,best amusement park,"I'd vote more for Knoebels. Always have a great day there. Last couple visits I've had at Hershey went bad. Ranging from having sunglasses and almost my wallet stolen at Skyrush, another visit being unbearable in the heat and half the food stands I wanted were either beyond busy or just for some reason not open that day."
14742,best romantic novel,"I'd have to go with Wolfsong by TJ Klune.  And then Exhale by Joel Abernathy.

I thinking more about prose, dialogue, themes, use of metaphors.  Less about plot and characters.  I guess more about how the story was written instead of the story itself."

65324,best phone service company,"How come when I click ""unlimited plans"" it's showing me plans that aren't unlimited data?

Edit: This is tedious to navigate on a phone, but I'm giving it a good 'ol American try. I'm looking for a plan that is unlimited data, but also allowed for 1080p video streaming. My current Sprint plan is unlimited with 1080p, but I pay an amount so high I'm assumed to admit it. I'll say this. I could make a car payment for the amount I'm paying for two lines. I'm a truck driver, so that 1080p unlimited is really crucial. It slows down after 35gb, but I hardly ever hit that cap. And even when I do, I can still watch 1080p videos most of the time"
27089,best board games,"I only have the base game personally. I’ve been thinking about getting some expansion material though myself. It’s a really good game to play over coffee in the morning. I find it oddly relaxing. Although, I think I like Tainted Grail more for a exploration game (that you can’t get right now unfortunately)."
