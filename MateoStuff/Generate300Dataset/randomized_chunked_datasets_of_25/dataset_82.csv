65324,"How come when I click ""unlimited plans"" it's showing me plans that aren't unlimited data?

Edit: This is tedious to navigate on a phone, but I'm giving it a good 'ol American try. I'm looking for a plan that is unlimited data, but also allowed for 1080p video streaming. My current Sprint plan is unlimited with 1080p, but I pay an amount so high I'm assumed to admit it. I'll say this. I could make a car payment for the amount I'm paying for two lines. I'm a truck driver, so that 1080p unlimited is really crucial. It slows down after 35gb, but I hardly ever hit that cap. And even when I do, I can still watch 1080p videos most of the time",best phone service company
