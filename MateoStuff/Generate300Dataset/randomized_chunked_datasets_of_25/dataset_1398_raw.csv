"Gunna have to agree with Icarus, The Devil You Know is also REALLY good.

But if you‚Äôre looking for a change of pace The Barkley Marathons is a fun ride (not sure if it‚Äôs still on Netflix)"
Their safety record isn't bad per se...they are one of the highest volume sky diving facilities in the country. The sport is inherently dangerous (See Minden/Tahoe tandem death just a couple days ago) but their accidents per # of skydivers is no worse than the national average.

"Peter Dinklage was in town for our comic expo in Calgary and i was playing blackjack at the casino by the expo center with my bestie.  

Pit boss kept coming to all the dealers and whispering in their ear.  Girl then looks at us and says: you two watch game of thrones?

I say yes.  She says: oh apparantly some famous guy from the show is over there playing blackjack...

Sure enough he's there playing blackjack.  We cash out and head to his table and sit down.

He asked if we were on a date to which my bestie replied she was gay and i am definitely not a woman haha.  Dinklage actually goes: well my foot tasted great haha.  Ended up playing blackjack with him for over an hour and drinking on his tab.  Super down to earth and polite.  

Everything id hope a celebrity encounter would be like."

Modern React with Redux [2020 Update]

I can say that it is pretty elaborate and explains in depth  various react concepts / project setup / deploying application to netlify etc. ,

There is some discount thing going on its available for 455 rupees ..."
"If your mom is a grandma, once my mom made a custom fabric with a word cloud of everyone in the family's names (Spoonflower) and sewed pillows and napkins out of it. My grandmother, a very cold old lady, cried. I think most grandmas/moms/matriarchs of large families would love this!"

"That would ignore your existing emacs and start yet another instance of emacs.  

For that reason, it's better to use `emacsclient` instead of `runemacs`.  But you need to make sure you do `M-x server-start` ahead of time in emacs."
