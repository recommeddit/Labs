"My partner is obsessed with the way I smell in Britney Spears Curious, lol. It's what I wore regularly when I was 20 and we started dating so he associates it with good memories I guess, lol."
"Yes, I tried a tooon of different settings. The dark transitions were especially bad with black frame insertion, and then without it, everything had pretty bad motion blur.

"I think you're describing Scotland. I mean...ppl say our weather's shite but climate change has made us warmer and the occasional floods are adding a bit of interest to the day....we've got plenty of nature - tourists come to climb our mountains and cycle. A 40 hour workweek sounds about right for most professions, generally pretty progressive, you;d have to look into healthcare eligibility a bit but it's mostly still free/low cost and pretty decent quality. Brexit might fuck youse up though - so be aware of that looming on the horizon."

"My go-to is Calvin Klein Eternity Air Woman. Really light and ethereal - really just like air. It's really inexpensive on Fragrancenet / Gift Express and it's a 100 ml (pretty) bottle too.

A la Tania Sanchez in the book ""Perfumes: The Guide,"" I really love this one, so I already have a backup bottle. Scared it might be discontinued one day, being a ""flanker""..."
