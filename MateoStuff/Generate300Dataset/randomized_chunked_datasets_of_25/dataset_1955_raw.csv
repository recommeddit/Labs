"Nothing really likes the shade, or nasty soil. Would Clematis and a trellis fence work?"
"He was really carried by the NVP no doubt, and now that we have him too, that just doubled Diggs up imo"
"Only problem is, ive watched em all :("
Binary Tree.
"From the replies here and from other sites that i searched, those two seem to be the most recommended. I guess it's not really the pencil, it's mostly how you use it!"
"1. code geass

"I prefer no music myself. I did listen to music before but I've started to appreciate silence so I can have 100% focus on the lifting. 

I think that every gym should stop playing fucking music so people can have silence by default or use their own music devices if they want music. Of course it's never going to happen but it would sure be better. Some people prefer to have a meditation approch to weightlifting, and then the music is probably going to be distracting."

"I read it for the comics and the puzzle page, on weekends I like to read the article that some crazy preacher writes. It lets me feel smug and superior."
"No. Most dentists recommend that a toothpaste contain fluoride, but nothing abrasive.

If you examine the material used in abrasive toothpastes using something called the Charpy hardness test, you will find that these materials have a very high Charpy hardness rating; much higher than the rating of tooth enamel. Anything with a higher hardness rating will easily cause damage to something with a lower hardness rating."

"Another one VS Code here.

Besides Microsoft office, VS Code is the only other ""best in class"" product to come out of Microsoft, in my opinion."
Bleeding is a sign of poor gum health. It's a sign of infection. Continue to floss regularly for a week and I guarantee you will not only get better at it but you will no longer bleed. You need to get in those gums and between you're teeth. Floss and brush regularly and you won't bleed!
"like, Chello! totes the best sounding!"
"It's not exactly advice for the average joe, but it's handy for people like travelling photographers and musicians who might well be carrying upwards of thirty thousand dollars in equipment on and off planes every few weeks."

"Ful backpacks. They're understated in appearance, many pockets, can hold a laptop, padded and completely waterproof in a torrential downpour"
"I’m in Cleveland, so relatively close to the border and have never seen a Mars bar. Maybe the searches are due to people looking up what the fuck a Mars bar is"
