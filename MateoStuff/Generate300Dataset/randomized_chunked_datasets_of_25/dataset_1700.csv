Brown and Rice both have compelling cases. I prefer Rice, though not enough to get emotional about it and start claiming disrespect or criminality (if you saw the post when Rice was 3rd)."
33378,best electric car,"Tough call, it seems people are only thinking short term. A car you want to keep forever may be the best value. 

I have a salesman friend that bought an early Model S, free supercharging, free fast internet, 8 year guarantee. About 250K miles on it now and this will be his last car, probably 20+ more years. 

Runs in the family, his dad still has a '40 Ford he bought as his first car."

I like listening to [Ensiferum](http://youtu.be/cO4QqaoFuso) on the cross-trainer and pretending I am striding across the artic tundra under the moonlight, or listening to [Amon Amarth](http://youtu.be/5jHxVFQQ0j0) doing seated cable rows and pretending I'm pulling the oar on a longship, headed out to plunder.
