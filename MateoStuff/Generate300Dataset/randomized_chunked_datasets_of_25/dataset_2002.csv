26198,"René Levesque. He started a brand of nationalism that was almost entirely civic in nature with no ""race identity"".

The people of Québec carry his legacy in some form or another in the way they conceive their nation. Liberal, secular and pluralist.

I also think he was a very moral and honest politician, without all the dirty playing. He was a surprisingly sporty loser in the 1980 referendum and worked to make Québec a better place inside Canada after his loss. He had his heart and his ideas in the right place and he really marked a departure from the old status of Québec as some sort of ""ireland of the americas"" (catholic, conservative and under the thumb of a larger overlord).

He laid the seeds of what would become a distinct nation within a united Canada.",best politician

59148,"In my experience from working with perfumes - certain bases sit better on certain skins! We had this book at the chemist I worked at that told you what kind of base (like floral or musk or fruity - I can't remember now but there were SO MANY) a perfume was and what other perfumes had a similar base. I LOVED Angel by Thierry Mugler and also used to wear (and get a lot of compliments on) Lolita by Lolilta Lempricka - turns out according to this book they were the same type of perfume! Also stayed on my skin the longest. 

I recommend going to a place that has heaps of sample bottles out, smelling some on cards, picking one and spraying it then wearing it for the day! I used to love a Dior one, tried it on my skin and got the worst headaches. Try this for your favourites and then pick the one that lastest the best/smelt the best on your skin because they really can change in scent once they mix with the oils on your skin :)",best perfume
