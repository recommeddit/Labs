7316,best laptop for general use,"Is the M1 still worth it with the new M1 Pro and Max systems now? Should I be waiting for the next normal M1 refresh? I just mean for regular use, nothing major."
42410,movies like Inception,"Agreed. The only thing I didn't like about The Village was M. Knight's cameo. Dude, you aren't Alfred Hitchcock."

13885,best research paper archive,"[Primer](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262610620chap1.pdf) from the book, but I found 'Structures of Scientific Revolutions' by Kuhn to be impressive and insightful for me as I went through college."
16203,best sunglasses for fashion,"I got a pair of ATTCL on Amazon for $26 that are the same style as clubmasters. They don't feel cheap at all. They have metal frames as well as polarized lenses.

[Here they are on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CGL7197/ref=twister_B07CGGNRCV?_encoding=UTF8&th=1) They have other styles too if you aren't looking for Clubmasters."
36815,best alcoholic drink,"It might grow on you in time. Also “house” or lowest priced vodka is way better than any of the fancy expensive “small batch” stuff. Costco brand vodka is one of the best. Sochu, which I Japanese vodka is super smooth. A hurricane is like alcohol fruit punch lol. It’s so good but super sugary."
41559,best instrument to play,It's just my experience but I was able to play a tune in the first day I picked the recorder.

It helps that it's very open, the wall behind me is open pillars facing the stairs and a walkway."
16859,best pet for toddlers,A fish is really the only thing I can think of that fits the bill for low maintenance and not a smelly cage.
26198,best politician,"René Levesque. He started a brand of nationalism that was almost entirely civic in nature with no ""race identity"".

The people of Québec carry his legacy in some form or another in the way they conceive their nation. Liberal, secular and pluralist.

I also think he was a very moral and honest politician, without all the dirty playing. He was a surprisingly sporty loser in the 1980 referendum and worked to make Québec a better place inside Canada after his loss. He had his heart and his ideas in the right place and he really marked a departure from the old status of Québec as some sort of ""ireland of the americas"" (catholic, conservative and under the thumb of a larger overlord).

He laid the seeds of what would become a distinct nation within a united Canada."
72039,best movies with a cool twist,"Not true, actually, it's just a happy coincidence that Vader is the Dutch word for father. When Lucas originally made the name Darth Vader he had been playing around with the words 'death' and 'invader', and changed them just slightly to get Darth Vader. (He did the same for the emperor, took 'death insidious' and we have Darth Sidious from that)"
28491,best breakfast foods,Right? It's what you'd get if you made it at home. Why pretend just because it's fast food you'll automatically get sick?

41298,best instrument to play,OBOE
59148,best perfume,"In my experience from working with perfumes - certain bases sit better on certain skins! We had this book at the chemist I worked at that told you what kind of base (like floral or musk or fruity - I can't remember now but there were SO MANY) a perfume was and what other perfumes had a similar base. I LOVED Angel by Thierry Mugler and also used to wear (and get a lot of compliments on) Lolita by Lolilta Lempricka - turns out according to this book they were the same type of perfume! Also stayed on my skin the longest. 

I recommend going to a place that has heaps of sample bottles out, smelling some on cards, picking one and spraying it then wearing it for the day! I used to love a Dior one, tried it on my skin and got the worst headaches. Try this for your favourites and then pick the one that lastest the best/smelt the best on your skin because they really can change in scent once they mix with the oils on your skin :)"
