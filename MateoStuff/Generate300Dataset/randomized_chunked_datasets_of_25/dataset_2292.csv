38389,I had an hour and 15 minutes between classes so i would read the school newspaper cover to cover and then the New York Times until I hit the business section. Uconn's paper was actually very well done. Well besides that one crazy bitch in the opinion section that made me face/palm twice a week.,best newspapers to read
60554,Derry Girls,Best comedy show on Netflix
70791,More of a twist ending than a plot twist but I will always love The Mist for how it ended despite how average it was.,best movies with a cool twist
17202,"It was Beat Fever but the devs ruined the game and closed it. RIP Beat Fever! Your rhythm game with a virtual world and team raids was epic while it lasted. I‚Äôm glad to have signed shirts from artists like R3hab, but more than anything I wish the app was still around üò© If anyone is a developer here and is interested in music there is a huge opportunity to gain a massive following of loyal players. Many of us paid to play and played for years. We still would be if the developers didn‚Äôt close it down!! I know a guy that would drop $5000 a week easily ü§™",best iOS game

47408,"Arizona--go hiking in the mountains and see the Grand Canyon. I visited for the first time last summer expecting it to be a big boring hole in the ground, but it brought tears to my eyes.",best state to visit in the United States
56210,"Interesting! I think I understand both perspectives. Lean's desire to not make a Western (ha!) or a conventional adventure film is evident, but I have to agree with O'Toole that the film is still stirring and exciting like an adventure film, it's just much more refined and cerebral.",best action and adventure movie
7861,"I think I am leaning towards a 2-in-1 at this point but still very open to suggestion (I have also considered the XPS). Trying to keep it around 1500 US dollars but willing to go a little above that range if need be. I definitely value some portability, as I will probably be starting grad school in a year or so. I do care about battery life but it isn't necessarily my number one priority. Other than school, it will be a general use laptop.",best laptop for general use
39635,"TWiP is the only one of the tetrad (you forgot TWiEVO!) that I haven't listened much to. I've always felt that TWiM was more accessible than TWiV. In the latter I feel like the podcasters throw out a lot more jargon, which might just be because of immunology (for real, immunology has the *worst* jargon).

I've had a couple emails read on TWiV in the past usually within a week but I'd be willing to bet that Zika is delaying your's.",best podcast for biologists
14696,"Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. If she's a serious reader, she can get into it enough to fall in love with the characters when it's not really a ""romance"" for like 100 pages... But it's not clearly ANY genre, but all. It's also a series, and she will love you for the introduction forever. I didn't think I liked these types of books at all, but these books kinda transcend genre because they have crazy settings, and AMAZING characters. Historical, funny, romantic, and mysterious.",best romantic novel

* 1 egg
* 1 mug of almost boiling water

Heat up water so it is hot enough to cook the egg. Crack egg in mug. stir really fast with a fork, be sure to break the yolk. Stir till the egg is mostly cooked, then add sugar.

Serve hot.",best medicine for a cold

23550,Not sure what‚Äôs up with your copy - Ive got essentially your same build and I‚Äôve never had it drop below ~55 FPS except for a few select times. For the most part it runs fantastic. Worst part of the game is the EA social stuff and whatnot.,best car racing video game
3616,"A lot of French universities have research institutes next to them which may share staff with them but are not technically a part of the university, hence their research does not count as coming from the university.",best college for research
47763,"A basic TI-83 or TI-84 is the norm.  I‚Äôd say unless you have experience with the TI-nspire, don‚Äôt get it (it‚Äôs not super user friendly).  The TI-89 will do the calculus for you and is normally never allowed on tests but could be useful when double checking homework.  

As a college math teacher, I personally prefer my students stick with the 83 or 84.  I‚Äôd say ultimately ask your teacher at your school, they may have specific guidelines.",best graphing calculator for vector calculus
57278,"yes, you don't need minerals in water to survive, if you can get it from elsewhere.  but because of dumb people in america and poor diets.  the government put it upon itself to reinforce everything with minerals and nutrients so people wouldn't die.  and yes, no tap water or bottled water has a heavy enough concentration of anything that can kill you.  unless you live in flint michigan.  then you might actually die from their tap water.  but not because the water was bad.  but because of the chemical processes that happened between the water and the pipes that caused it to be bad.  

that's the point i'm trying to drive across to this other guy.  this other guy is all in a hissy fit because i recommended arrowhead and crystal geyser which is too acidic and has too much fluorine so it's bad for you.",best water brand
67657,"People have been asking this question for 30+ years. The ""if it doesn't pay the bills, no one will work on it"" argument has been done to death and while it's certainly a factor in the death of some projects, there are others that live for decades or longer without raising a dime.

Not all monetary rewards come in the form of a paycheck. Being able to put ""maintained a project with a million+ downloads for multiple years"" on your resume answers a lot of questions. That's about the closest thing to compensation OSS can reliably offer. 

Over the years, I've seen just as many commercial third-party dependencies fail on me as OSS third-party packages. It's why we get nervous about taking them on. Sometimes even paying a developer's not enough to get them to maintain a project. The promise of OSS is when that happens, other people can pick it up from them. That nobody's done this for Axios could have a bunch of contributing factors, but I don't know enough context to decide.",axios alternatives reddit
61722,"Okay yeah, you got me on Shadow of the Colossus, that barely counts in my book. I guess I see RPGs as just single player open world games, but your definition probably pertains more to what they were asking. Sorry",Best RPG game on PS4
48210,"I did this for my living room.  I knew I wanted a grey paint but I couldn't pick from the 5-7 samples I painted on the wall. Some were too warm, some were too cool.

I found a great couch that incorporated greys and I matched a swatch to the couch.  It looks amazing.",best color to paint with
