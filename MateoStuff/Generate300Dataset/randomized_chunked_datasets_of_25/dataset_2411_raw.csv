"[Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine](http://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~chenk/Courses/PL/Papers/Mccarthy-Lisp60.pdf) by John McCarthy, and Paul Graham's [article](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps) about it, made me understand computer programming as a formally definable endeavor and not just a hack"
"Any state near Mexico can get these fairly easily...its a lollipop that is watermelon flavored, and coated with chili powder and dried lemon.  It sounds disgusting, but my god I would give any other candy I had to my friends to procure those bad boys.  They make a similar type with mango instead of watermelon."

"i'm certainly not mad about it, all things considered. for example, i much prefer Assassins Creed Origins and Odyssey over the entire system in the games prior to them."

"I love that he made 2 versions of it, original version is the order of events as they were discovered on Internet forums, and 2nd version is true chronological order.  It’s a wild ride."
"My ""significant problem"" with Catan for groups of mixed experience is that so much of the game is determined during the initial placement portion. The experienced players have a huge advantage that can't really be rectified short of taking decision making away from the newbies, which is suboptimal to say the least.

"Wow, can't believe they named that place after the chair. /s"
