"My pair is the grey lenses. It only turned out that way because I liked that specific frame colour and grey lenses was what it came with :p I think it's meant for sunnier conditions so it's too dark if I wear them in the evening or when it's rainy. Although I can still wear them when it's overcast but still ""bright""... If you know what I mean..."
"I read these but had trouble getting through them.

I would replace that entry with the ""Old Man's War"" series instead."
It's pretty easy to argue against it..Milan 89-94..
"> I think they should fix it

Native fetch in the browser behaves the same way, it's not something specific to  the `node-fetch` library, so when you say ""it"" you're actually referring to the standard created by the browser vendors (a.k.a. WHATWG).

While it's not ergonomic in this particular case, it's done for a good technical reason, and is one of the very few caveats you have to remember (just like the fact that 4xx/5xx responses don't reject the initial promise). But in opposition to the article, I would just recommend using Axios if you want these things smoothed over for you.

`fetch` is intentionally barebones - it's first and foremost a replacement for `XMLHttpRequest`. While there's definitely an improvement in ease-of-use compared to XHR, that's not its primary concern - the intention is that wrapper libraries (like Axios) fulfill that role.

"A penis. 

At least if you want a good position."
"Well, if Lemieux didn't have the serious injury problems and the supporting casts Gretzky had in his prime he could have challenged these records. 

There is also more to the game than sheer offensive production. Howe scored more goals era adjusted and was a significantly more well rounded player. Orr is the only defenseman to ever lead the league in scoring (and he almost certainly would have done it more if not for injury problems). 

I think Gretzky's the greatest. But I at least think you can think otherwise and make a reasonable argument for it. 

Is there really a reasonable argument for any wide receiver being better than Rice?"
"Never heard of gangs of london until now. I’m a big fan of high quality series (the wire, saul, narcos, breaking bad) and usually can’t get through any that are low caliber. Will def try this one out!"
"Wow, do you know how many watts the charger is rated for or does it say this no matter what?"
Yea i love my excavator too
"Exactly that, yeah"
I feel like I just got mansplained
I just heard of bioglass. Dentists in US are now recommending it for all children.
"There are perfectly good reasons people can have for not liking EVs and several people have made this clear in their comments. If you're down voting them simply for having opinions, you're no better than a rabid fanboi. This is a perfectly good topic of conversation, don't send people to the bottom just because you're in love with daddy elon.

Edit: this isn't directed at OP btw"
"There should be a usb to usb c in there unless you lost it or you have a model that didn't include it. Sorry, I'd still stick to the brand nektec even if ur looking for usb 2.0 to usbc."
"I lived in a small out of the way neighborhood at the time so I didn't need that many.

If you live in a high traffic trick-or-treat area, pop tarts are probably too expensive. But if you live in a neighborhood that only gets a few kids, like me, pop tarts are the way to go."
I think it's the same source...
"I really enjoy novels written by Devney Perry, Melanie Harlow, Vi Keeland, or RS Grey.  I find them to all be really solid writers and it’s not often that I read one of their novels and get distracted by crappy dialogue, unbelievable plot, errors, etc.  I really can’t pick a particular novel by any of them because I think they’re all great!  They also publish pretty frequently; Perry and Harlow write novels in series mainly.

If I had to pick one novel that was really well written it would be Beach Read by Emily Henry."
"tenor saxophone, i am sad to admit this for i play the trumpet. Lol"
">yeah, but they can't legally call them babies, so they are 'tiny childeren' or 'mini humens'."
"Kona, E Niro, Soul, ID4 are some other options. The i3 are a bit old. Here in Europe they practically gift them away at 150€/month leading and 21k Euros for the base price. If costs are the same, definitely go.for the model 3."
Some people want to sound like woodchippers I guess
"> Ah, the miracle of statistics!

I fixed it for you."
Nice! Almost went with the mini but I needed a new phone at the time and the pro came out first. They’re awesome.
"First you're ""my mommy"", then you become ""oh that's just my mom"". Shortly you're ""uhg...mom"",  and at some point, in their teens you become a piece of furniture.  You will become ""hey mom"", then ""mom, what do you think"".  Eventually you will hear your own voice and thoughts coming straight out of their mouths and you're "" this..is my MOM""."
"Even though she’s not my favorite, I think it’s Khloe. She’s experienced an immense amount of pain and bullying throughout her life, and while I don’t think the other Kardashian girls haven’t had difficulties throughout their lives, I think Khloe is the *most* relatable to the average human being. I know that doesn’t automatically make her upstanding and ethical but I think she can empathize more with and might try to understand and treat others with dignity and respect maybe a tad better than the others."
