"Wouldn't have done especially well on xbox*

And yeah, my little brother got it when it came out and I just couldn't believe my eyes.  It is hard to think of it as a stand-alone game, but hey, maybe it is decent.  Still can't believe you chose that over everything else though lol. But it's w/e, I guess I'm just still mad that Xbox has the rights to B+K, preventing a proper sequel and their inclusion into Smash."

"Haha, I was an EE major but in my first CS lab I drew a picture of knuckles from Sonic using javaFX. The prof gushed how he used to play sonic with his son and showed me a bunch of emulators. Ever since then he would make an effort to show me interesting stuff that was out of the curriculum. He gave me no choice but to switch to CS.

"Hey, I'm currently owning a Benq GL2460 ( https://www.benq.eu/de-ch/monitor/home-office/gl2460/specifications.html ) and now want to change my setup by stacking to monitors on top of each other.

My question is, wich monitor should I buy?

I'm very happy with the Benq one, should I just buy the same one again? 

(My budget is more or less 200€) 

Thank you for your help!"
I agree with all your advice. I never go near thise charcoal and whitening ones. I don’t bite into hard foods either because I don’t want to chip more teeth. I already have enough damage done sadly .
"> I am NOT saying this is a bad thing or that the game is less enjoyable, what I am saying is that by the time I was level 30ish I really just wanted to complete the main story and move on to other games so I got the booster and did just that.

To counter this perspective for /u/walnutbutt or anyone else. I think this depends on what you consider to be ""side-stuff"". I lost interest in the seemingly infinite side-quests and gained interest in the cult/mercenary stuff, which feels hand-in-hand with both your character progression and the storyline.

After I got to level 30, it felt like the pace of my progression exploded and very soon after I was brushing up against 45+, because at that point almost all of the map is available (or within reach). When focusing only on the main story, and cult, and the mercenaries, I never felt like I had to do any side quests to keep up with my leveling. Of course, I have not finished yet, so maybe that'll change once I'm past 50 or so. For the past 15+ levels though, I haven't had any gear that was on level because I had been leveling up too fast for my gear to stay current. 

I do agree that for this game, you have to be okay with passing up tons of sidequests and you have to be okay with quests and missions that send you in several directions, which is what starts to feel like filler. To continue the story you have to *go talk to this person*, but they want you to *do this* before they'll talk to you, and so forth. Which feels lazy sometimes.

But other than that, it feels like they put time into every side quest, doing *something* to make it feel interesting even if the overall structure is repetitive. 

So I recommend **not** completing every island you come across unless you need to or really want to. I very rarely do a side-quest anymore unless I just feel like staying in the area. I haven't found that I need to after level 20 or so and once the map starts opening up, there's always more things to do than somewhat meaningless side-quests."
