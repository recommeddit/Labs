10439,best suitcase lock,"The idea is to set it yourself, but most of the instructions are conveniently missing.

Oh and also most of those safes are really crappy, I mean you can bounce them on the bed and the door will pop on a good portion of them."
68850,best science fiction novel,Missing Alastair Reynolds but good list nonetheless.
37437,best amusement park,"If we're going with singular parks, it's hard to argue against Energylandia. I don't think we've seen a park built up that fast with the kind of quality that they have."
16789,best pet for toddlers,"She hates seeing our child play alone... having trouble having another child and as much as we try to always keep him company, its hard to do so every minute we are home. Hes very active and always asking for attention... and he loves playing with dogs when we go over to friends houses etc... I know, might not be the right reason, but that's why she wants a dog, basically to give him a companion..."

56798,best desktop monitor,You know what I thought it was 60hz but every source I'm looking at says like 56-76 Hz I don't know why.
16571,best pet for toddlers,"One thing to consider is that lots of small animals have short lifespans.  So, if you're going to get a small animal there is a good chance it will die before your son is old enough to form long term  memories of having a first pet 

Also, small birds and mammals are not generally a good match for cat safe homes. 

I'd honestly stick with a dog for now, if possible.  An adult or senior dog will be a way better companion for your son than any exotic.  Less fragile and will be able to hold its own against the cats. 

However if you do decide for an exotic, I'd get a lock for the cage, so you have control when the animal is let out.  Otherwise your son will , at some point, open the cage just to play with it for a second, and then put it back and get distracted before closing it properly and then it escapes."
12694,best gifts for mom,I found the other day that they are now being manufactured by another company under contract and are not officially Hitachi branded anymore. Perhaps to escape the brand association with glorious pornography.
17482,best iOS game,"I dont agree. I play it for 2 years. You must have all the teams anyway , it s a collecting game. You shouldnt focus on one char or on one team. 
I play F2P and I am kyber most of times , top 100 at arena and top 10 at ships."

47345,best state to visit in the United States,">I've been thinking of visiting minneapolis 
 
Do it and catch a Vikings game. See if you can touch base with someone who lives there on this subreddit and they'd probably be thrilled to give you recommendations.
 
>but I also want to visit somewhere south like Dallas
 
If you're skipping NYC and LA I'd skip Dallas as well. If you want the south I'd recommend Memphis or Atlanta over Dallas.
 
I've enjoyed my visits to Chicago; I don't buy into the NYC vs Chicago Pizza debate: thin crust and deep dish are both great.
 
Kansas City is one of my favorites: if you go be sure to check out Joe's Kansas City BBQ.
 
If you want a more unconventional pick I'd point you to Lincoln/Omaha if you time it right you can catch a Nebraska home game which is a sight to behold though next year will be a rebuilding year and Morrill Hall has an interesting fossil collection. The Henry Doorley Zoo in Omaha is one of the best in the world if that's your thing, the Jocelyn art museum is perfectly serviceable and the SAC air museum is great."
7804,best laptop for general use,"Hi, since you prefer a 2-in-1, I'd say go for the [**HP Envy x360 13""**](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=728909&clickref=legos45-suggestalaptop&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13-ay0021nr). It happens to be on sale currently. You get a 8-core Ryzen 7 4700U, 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD, and a 1080p 13.3"" IPS 300 nit display. It can definitely run Valorant.

3979,best online college,Ah! Thanks for the information.
5068,best home improvement store,Menards beats the pants off both in terms of selection.
17280,best iOS game,"To The Moon and Journey are also great games that I haven’t seen anyone mentioned yet. 

Btw Dragon Quest VIII’s last update removed the 15fps cap. It’s running at a solid 30fps on my 2020 SE."
68048,best science fiction novel,"Solid list but I'm really not so sure about Neuromancer. I picked it up and really wanted to like it but I just don't think its a good book. The characters a pretty one-dimensional and the plot is super convoluted. I read the last 25% two times to try to figure it out and still don't think it really makes sense. 

Maybe its worth reading because it defined the genre of cyberpunk but I don't think its a good book otherwise."
