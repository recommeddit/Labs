10121,best pencil for drawing,"Best reply. Start with any tool that can make a wide range of shades and get to drawin. Unless you are selling your art, the quality of your tools matters little. 

Not that you do this OP, but a lot of people hide behind high quality tools. I've seen people shell out hundreds of dollars for markers and pens and pencils and electric erasers and god knows what. Their art still sucks, surprise.

64150,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"Deezer has some audiobooks too, which you can download using Deemix or similar tools. Best way to search for them is typing “(Unabridged)” in the search bar. The format sucks (a bunch of 3 minute tracks), but the quality makes it worth it imho.

Edit: You have to select “albums” after typing “(Unabridged)”."
4243,best text editor,"> Honestly, I would like some honest answers as to where is Vim lacks or situations I'm better off using a different text editor/IDE

Vim sucks at understanding your project structure and code. IDEs are typically much, much better at this. Efforts to close that gap are generally complicated, hackish, and subsequently fragile.

Vim's great strength is raw text manipulation, emphasis on ""raw"" because its understanding of that text, semantically, is generally poor.

> Every time I start a new job or my smug colleagues are like: ""huehue, this guy still vims, I havent used vim since college, its 2018 bro"". Just grinds my gears.

Get better at Vim. My colleagues very quickly realize that my Vim usage is a super power, not a throwback or liability. I've *routinely* had people looking over my shoulder say ""WTF?"", because my editor is doing crazy shit to text seemingly on its own. Any time I do co-development, or screenshare my development work, people are blown away at what's happening in my editor compared to what they're using to seeing in theirs. Just get good at Vim and you'll have no need to justify it. It will speak for itself. 

Note, that people with strong mastery of good IDE tools, like Visual Studio + Resharper, can do similarly mind-blowing shit at a higher semantic level via templates and refactoring tools.  The most powerful position is to be master of both (via tools like ViEmu), where low level text manipulation is done via Vim's editing model, and semantic manipulation is done via IDE tools."

24360,best anime,"Let's see, I've seen 32 of the 100, including 8 of the top 10. 3 of the top 17 I dropped (FMA Brotherhood, Haibane Renmei and Steins Gate), the first 2 of which I've never finished.

Nice to see the very old, but very loved by me Galaxy Express 999 there. As well as shows like Kyousougiga, Now and Then Here and There and Eden of the East which don't get mentioned enough. Beyond the original Gundam, good to see Turn A there which is one of its best shows.

I'm not going to argue below top 10 for it, but number one overall for Evangelion just goes to show how insanely overrated it is."
16903,best iOS game,"I love my strategy games so:
Civilisation 6
Kingdom: Two Crowns
Bloons TD 6
Kingdom Rush series
Splendour (card game)"
37931,best Marvel movie,"Personally I skip out entirely on Phase Two. That phase nearly broke me. Very disappointing compared to the earnest charms of the first phase. Phase 3 felt like they finally got the hang of their formula and went back to the sugar and spice and good director hires that I came to Phase One for, only even more wild and less conservative in tone."
