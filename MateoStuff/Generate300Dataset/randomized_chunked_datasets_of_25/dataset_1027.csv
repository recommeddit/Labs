But they're not punishing you,' he said. 'They're freeing your soul. If your frightened of dying, and your holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. If you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth.”

7006,best iPhone,"I’d consider this but after selling both my XR and Note 9 I was going to put the leftover balance on my credit card and I don’t think Costco takes anything but Visa and my card’s a MasterCard. :/

Maybe I’ll just wait for prices on the secondhand market to come down a wee bit. I know T-Mobile has decent deals too but the idea of shackling myself to them for another two years is something I’d rather not do."

27365,best stocks to buy,"It's funny, I remember reading a similar post to this like 7-8 years ago. Most of the 'popular' choices back then went on to have subpar gains.

&#x200B;

Just because your stock isn't mentioned in this thread doesn't mean it can't do good. Stick to your guts and have conviction, folks!"

12874,best gifts for mom,"Mom here...two kids, 5 & 7...husband.  Here is a list...very specific because you asked.  Bottom line is that we want YOU to think about US and what we like to do.

1.  Some time alone.  Take the kids out of the house and let me just relax.  Don't ask me where to take them/what to feed them/what they should wear...just.go.
2.  I garden.  I would love some nice gardening gloves, a gift card for a great garden center.  What are her hobbies?  Accessorize her hobby.
3.  A picnic somewhere beautiful.  Pack a cooler/backpack with good cheese and crackers, good wine and chocolate and lunches for the kids...throw in a blanket and a little vase and pick me a flower along the way.
4.  Write me a letter telling me what you love about me and why you think I'm a good mother.
5.  Cook me dinner - try to remember what I like/don't like.  Shop and clean up yourself.  It's not a present when I have to clean it all up the next day.
6.  I miss my friends...arrange a girls night for me, find and book a babysitter, make reservations, make sure my friends are free.
7.  Don't say stuff like, ""it's a made up holiday..."" unless you are thoughtful and do stuff for me all year.
8.  Send MY mom and YOUR mom some flowers.

TL/DR:  Be thoughtful

EDIT:  Oh My - Gold x2 - amazing!  I want to make clear that this is a list of suggestions/options - was IN NO WAY intended to be a 'you must do ALL of this'.  Pick one - or two, if you want, depending on what your Mom/Spouse is into.  Keep in mind, regarding #8, that women tend to do the shopping for their husband's Mom, as well as their own.  For Mother's Day I do something for my MIL, my own Mom, and I remind/suggest stuff for my brother to do for his wife and our Mom (at his request).  If you are married and want to do something for the Mother of your children, doing something nice for HER mom says that you appreciate that she raised the woman you love and you are grateful.  It is a sweet thing to do. Also, I know it seems counter-intuitive that for Mom's day, many of us just want some time to ourselves - but being a Mom means being on call all the time.  Mom's of toddlers can't shower or poop in peace.  They never have an uninterrupted meal, they hear every cough in the night, the demands are relentless.  Just a few uninterrupted hours when you're not 'on-call' is heaven.  And for the sake of the universe - if you know a single Mom, or Dad, consider doing something sweet for them."
14553,best romantic novel,"Oh, An Alexis Hall newbie! He is amazing. He writes beautiful, LGBTQ contemporary novels that are take your breath away funny, genuine and heartfelt. I usually recommend Boyfriend Material as a starting point (fade to black but the romance is on point). However my favorite of his novels is For Real. I just can’t say enough good things about it. Um, but just know that one is not fade to black. Far from it 😉

TJ Klune is very similar in that he writes LGBTQ romance stories. His sweetest book is The House in the Cerulean Sea. No sex and the romance is a sub plot but beautifully written. 

My favorites of his are Wolfsong and the rest of that series. It is paranormal romance with werewolves but it is really well done and one of my favorites of that genre. 

The Lightning Struck Heart is hilarious. It basically makes fun of fantasy tropes and the main character is so endearing. Laugh out loud funny but with a sweet, slow burn romance. Lots of pining. 

For contemporary- I really enjoy his How to Be a Normal Person."
31700,best hotel to live in,"You should look into getting an e-book reader if you read that many books, I know some people like having the physical books, but it would save you the hassle of having to ship them when you move around."

Nomad makes great looking cases, and they do not add too much bulk to the phone. 

Also, I'm going to install a [Zagg](https://www.zagg.com/) glass screen protector too."

32702,best vacation resort,"I travel extensively for work and usually have to make my own arrangements. I can and have organised complex multi-centre vacations but it is a lot of work.

Going to a good, all-inclusive resort is a way of losing that source of worry. I can't comment on Sandals, but there is something to be said for no having to carry cash around (and worry about it on the beach). General security is better because such resorts do not like freeloaders so no strangers on the territory and the other guests do not petty thieve.

However, you very much get what you pay for. A good resort will have a wide selection of food and drink and buffets tend to be refreshed for the duration rather than running out of goodies. It will often have a kids club so your children are looked after and entertained.

If you do feel crazy, a resort complex is not a ship. You can take organised excursions or just head out by yourself at any time."

30092,best money managing app,"I currently use MoneyWiz 2 - picked it up on a sale somewhere.

it's fairly decent - a little clunky in reporting and looking back on stuff.

the best app I have ever used is Expense Manager by the developer bishinews. that app is now ad-supported but they have an ad-free paid app, as well.

the pro version is on my sale watchlist and nearing the top of my yet-unbought wishlist."
68676,best science fiction novel,I liked the biginning premise of Reade but it just kept getting more and more crazy with the main characters personally tracking down the hackers accross the world.
