Its a little compromise with the protection, but worth it imo.  Definitely a big case and not recommended if you want something slim... But you can't beat the protection!",best iphone case

61224,"**Persona 5**, if you don't mind the slight anime aspect and high school stuff. It plays so well, the story is freaking good, the soundtrack is so original... I would say it's a piece of art on its own, rather than a simple game. Also, damn pancake plot twists.

**The Witcher 3**, a classic. I tried to touch it twice and only played like 15 minutes the first two times. The third time I tried it, I got completely absorbed by it. By the time I had enough of the game, I had already 180h of playtime.

&#x200B;

**Dragon Quest 11** if you're into a more classic story, classic gameplay, classic characters, classic worlds, classic concept... well you get it. But it's a good kind of classic.

&#x200B;

**Bloodborne**, if you're the type to consider it a RPG. I love how at the beginning you feel like you're being hunted and the more you play, the more you realize how you've become yourself the hunter. I love the playability that every different weapon brings. It's satisfying, it's an immersive world and it's FREAKING FUN AS HELL! You may also try another Souls game but I've only played Bloodborne until now.

&#x200B;

**Final Fantasy**

VII - A classic, if you haven't played it yet, start here and enjoy one of the best games of all time.

VIII - One of my favorite, very underrated, excellent story and enjoyable characters. Not the best gameplay mechanics, but you get used to it very quickly.

IX - Touching, warming, a classic fantasy world with incredible gameplay features.

X - My favorite Final Fantasy story, really long playtime (got me about 200hrs to finish everything), visually impressive, soundtrack on point. It's a turn-based so you'll like it or hate it.

XII - The ""Ok"" Final Fantasy, it's not bad, but it's not on pair with the other ones. Political story, a bit of a Star Wars vibe in a modern fantasy world, inovative and fun gameplay mechanics, visually impressive as well (even tho I got bored of the same color palette throughout the game). The invocations are epic!

XV - The ""Well..."" Final Fantasy. It's a really good game but a bad Final Fantasy in my opinion. Story wise, it's fine, but lots of plot holes that rely on DLCs. Fun characters, really fun battle system, impressive visuals, soundtrack most excellent... but all in all, it feels a bit off.

&#x200B;

**Nier Automata**, I haven't personnally played but I've seen some footages on YouTube and some friends can't stop recommending me this. I've hard the soundtrack and it's BEAUTIFUL and EPIC. I also really like the whole concept and everything feels well-executed. I personnally can't wait to play this game.

&#x200B;

**Digimon Cyber Sleuth**, an excellent Digimon game (for once in a while!), looots of digivolutions, a good story for what's it's worth, really really fun and addictif. I just didn't like the long texts and conversations, it breaks the rhythm of the game.

&#x200B;

**Horizon Zero Dawn**, if you consider it a RPG (I do, personnally). A big open world, really fun mechanics, top notch story, massive enemies with impressive visuals. It's good to look at, good to play and simply a masterpiece, enough said.

&#x200B;

**Skyrim Special Edition**, if you haven't played Skyrim until now... well, drop everything you're doing and prepare to lose days or even months of your life.

&#x200B;

**Kingdom Hearts** franchise. I could tell you to play them all, because every Kingdom Hearts contributes to a very convoluted, complex story, that you would prefer to watch on a 30min summary on YouTube. But it's not a bad kind of convoluted story. The gameplay is really good, it's dynamic and fresh. I would say, play 1, 2, Birth By Sleep, Dream Drop Distance and 3 last. Even though the other games are REALLY good as well, those are the most important.

&#x200B;

**Monster Hunter World**, if you're the kind of person who loves grinding, showing big weapons and defeating big monsters, in a massive world along with other players. The game is extremely fun and you'll spend a lot of time there.

&#x200B;

**Divinity Original Sin 1 & 2**, if you like a more tactical gameplay but still very innovative, complex with lots of freedom. Story wise it's incredible and really immersive. It's a kind of game you'll LOVE or simply be ""meh"". But it never feels like a bad game.

&#x200B;

**World of Final Fantasy**. I could have put this along the other Final Fantasy games, but this feels incredibly different. The lore is 100% from Final Fantasy games, but the game itself is more like a Pokemon meets Digimon 2.0. It's soooo FUN! It doesn't have the best story or the best characters, and visually it may feel a bit childish (even though you get used to it very quickly), but damn, I can't stress enough how fun it is, it plays really well.

&#x200B;

**Assassin's Creed Odyssey**, if you consider it a RPG. You now have some side quests, you can customize your character a bit more and it's really fun to play. It doesn't feel much like an Assassin's Creed. I personally think this is a game that absorbed lots of Action and western RPG elements and tried to be both at the same time, but doesn't excel at neither. Buuuut, it has a huge open world, it's visually excellent (minus some texture problems, but nothing out of this world) and it's smooth as hell.

&#x200B;

I don't really remember other games that I have played, but some people talk about the ""Tales of"" games (Tales of Berseria, Tales of Zesteria etc).

&#x200B;

EDIT: There's also **Final Fantasy XIV**. It's a MMORPG, subscription-based, but REALLY worth it. There's content for months, the story is pretty impressive for a MMO, lots of references to other Final Fantasy games and it's ALWAYS being updated with new content, new jobs (or classes, like healer, warrior, etc), new maps, dungeons, raids, etc. And the PS3/PS4 servers are the same as the PC ones, so you get to play with anyone you want.",Best RPG game on PS4

9697,"First year here. I’ve lived at both FT and San Miguel. I think it depends on what you prefer.

The one thing I was worried about when I was moving to San Miguel was the community bathroom situation. But, it wasn’t that bad actually, because the bathroom does get regularly cleaned.

At FT, even with your private bathroom, if your suite mates/roommate don’t clean up after themselves, it’s no different than a community bathroom lol. Also, it can be really annoying at times when your suite mates forget to unlock the door.

Anyway, here are some pros and cons at least from my view:

FT: (pros)
-private bathroom 
-big study space(I really liked the Linda Vista room at my time at FT)
-Room size

-(cons)
-It can get pretty loud at night, especially with driving cars yelling “F**k FT!”
-Inconvenience (Bc FT is off campus, if you forget your hw/papers, you can’t just go to your dorm in like 5 min unlike someone who lives at one of the Chi-5 dorms)

San Miguel 
(Pros)
-On Campus (This is what I like best about San Miguel. If I wanted to take a nap, I could just go straight to my dorm. Also, Ortega and DLG are really near my dorm)

-Quiet(Even though a lot of people prefer the social aspect of FT, I like a quiet dorm:)

(Cons)
-Fire Alarms (lol) There’s been like 6 fire alarms, and there was this one weekend when an alarm went off on Saturday and Sunday (ramen/popcorn related)

-People rag on the elevators, but since I live on the first floor, I don’t use them lol.

Feel free to PM if you have any other questions!",best dorm hall at UCSB
