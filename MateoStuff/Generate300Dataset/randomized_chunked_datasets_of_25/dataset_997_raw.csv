Great list but it’s like a crime to exclude OB4CL when you got 36 Chambers and Liquid Swords on there.
Don't forget shell based tab completion! It is the real star of that combo.
"Twin Peaks was a national phenomenon primarily because of the murder mystery. I don't think any list of ""The Best Whodunits"" is complete without mentioning that one. I dunno how fair it is to expect the viewer to figure out the mystery though, it's pretty fucking wild when it's all said and done."
They got marked up because they were worn on Mad Men. American Optical originally held the US contact for aviators and later lost them to Randolph. Buy the AO ones for cheaper.

I get a compliment here and there for various scents. My most complimented? Prada Luna Ross’s Sport. I wear it more often now because of this although it’s not one of MY favorites.
"Hell yeah, the Brendan Fraiser mummy movies rule."
"Bergamotte 22 - Le Labo
White Suede - Tom Ford

Bloodborne.
The rack has Ted Baker clubmasters for that price range. Just bought a pair myself
"Either Oral-8 or Cloggate.

I buy from a shady Chinese dollar store."
LaDanian Tomlinson played defense?
"It doesn't make any difference what's popular.

The words ""on trend"" are a slight against all people making aesthetic decisions."
"Lg gram 14 and matebook X are very niched products aimed for extreme portability. I personally would have gone for LG gram 16/17 if I were to get one (it's literally a 13inch laptop but with a bigger display). Despite matebook X being a really nice looking laptop, out of those that you've mentioned, I think Yoga Slim 9i better suits your work style.  Other than that, maybe you might want to pay a little bit of premium for zenbook duo and or the new coming razer blade 14."
"If it wasn't so bad for me, I'd drink it every day."
Français c'est garbage
"If you had 15 year old Ray Bans, these were also made by Luxottica. 

Luxottica bought RB in 1999 and started making them In 2001. So, anything post 2001 is made by Luxottica. I do agree that the Chinese made Luxottica stuff is cheaper looking and feeling than the Italian stuff. I normally stick to the Italian stuff and I can tell a vast difference."
Interesting - I copied the link and opened it in my browser and suddenly it’s there!
