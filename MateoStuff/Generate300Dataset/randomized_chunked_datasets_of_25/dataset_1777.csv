13256,best gifts for mom,My mom is super into true crime and loves books so I got her a new release. I think gifts that are personal and show you know what they are like are more memorable and appreciated. My brother got my mom a spa day gift card once and my mom barely even gets her haircut let alone treats herself to a spa. So just try to think of things you know your mom likes to do but maybe wouldn‚Äôt buy herself

54688,best water filter,"I'm a fan of zero. It's not just a matter of lasting longer, but taste which is purely a preference.

Keep an eye on amazon and buy the 8 pack when they go on sale. Filters don't go bad, so doesn't matter if you store them for a year."
17075,best iOS game,I'd be curious to see a top list of all F2P software from you.

61098,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I just watched all the episodes.  Although the premise is extremely clever, I don't know that I can say that many of the characters are ""extremely clever"" themselves.  It does have an ample amount of dry wit thanks to it being a British show."
29864,best money managing app,andromoney is what I use. It's very visually bare bones but it does all of the above. There's ads in the free version but they're not super obnoxious.
58740,best cologne,"As someone who is into frangracnes, I severly disagree with Reas0ns opinion. If you talk to anyone in the fragrance community on youtube, fragranctica or basenotes, the vast, vast majority, nearly 100% does not treat fragrances as a ""foundation"". We like to appreciate and evaluate scents based on the image we get in our mind when smelling. Some fragnces smell dark, earthy, smoky. Some smell sweet, floral and musky. Some smell fresh, soapy and clean. We like to treat frangrances based on how they make us feel.

If it is a hot sunny summer day, I don't want to smell smoky, leathery or of tobacco. I generally want to smell fresh, clean and invigorated. If I am going out to a nice bar on a cool night with my girlfriend though, I might absolutely want to smell that way though. This is how 99% of people who are in the community feel. Reas0ns statements are very, very rare in the community."
