Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me"
61300,Best RPG game on PS4,"YES! I was surprised by the epic scale of it given it was originally a handheld title.
I actually didn't finish my second playthrough, I need to pick up where I was, at some point. I just need to remember to make the different choices."
6161,best Netflix documentary,"Yes! I thought it was going to be very different, even so, it was excellent."
66061,best college in california,Why the switch?
8682,best toothpaste,I just found a 3 pack of Colgate for under $4 at Walmart. No one is too poor that they can’t scrap together $4 for months worth of toothpaste. You can find $4 on the ground in a day if you look for it.

4722,best home improvement store,All things being equal the it can be convenient to use one place to get a 5% contractors discount if you're going to be doing a bunch of stuff.  Not sure if that applies to appliances though.
17758,best Kardashian,A lot of people shouldn’t have done a lot of things but I agree Khloe is the best answer

9761,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I would say it really truly depends on the person. For example, as a freshman I really wanted to live in Manzanita Village, or San Miguel because they were considered some of the quieter dorms. However, if you wanted to socialize more, you would probably feel happier in FT or any of the Channel Island dorms. It really depends on who you are as a person."
39280,best web browser,I go back and try it again every few weeks. Memory leak issue still remains. I've tried it on multiple computers and every time it crawls up to over 2GB usage and slows the PC down to a crawl.

7059,best iPhone,I’ve swapped from OLED to LCD back and forth since 2014 and still don’t mind it. I’m starting to realize I’m more of the typical consumer than I’d like to admit. Even downgrading from “Very High” quality to “Normal” on Spotify I can’t hear a distinct difference.
58221,best cologne,"I'm really surprised Armani Code isn't further towards the top. Smells Armani Code, gets extremely wet."
29565,best game console,"Move Steel Battalion off of the Xbox 360 list!  It's for the original, not the 360.

There was a Steel Battalion title on the 360, but it was a Kinect game whose entire premise fell on invoking [Get a Hold of Yourself, Man!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan) on the other guys in your tank.  Over and over and over with shoddy controls and putting the mech controls on, well, a controller.

You also can't play the original on the 360 because the 40 button, 3 stick, 3 pedal controller is required to play, but is not recognized by the 360 as a control device if somehow modded to plug into the 360.

Edit: and actually, no, not all xbox games work with the 360; [just barely over half](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360)"
