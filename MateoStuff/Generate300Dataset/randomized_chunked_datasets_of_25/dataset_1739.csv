29565,"Move Steel Battalion off of the Xbox 360 list!  It's for the original, not the 360.

There was a Steel Battalion title on the 360, but it was a Kinect game whose entire premise fell on invoking [Get a Hold of Yourself, Man!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan) on the other guys in your tank.  Over and over and over with shoddy controls and putting the mech controls on, well, a controller.

You also can't play the original on the 360 because the 40 button, 3 stick, 3 pedal controller is required to play, but is not recognized by the 360 as a control device if somehow modded to plug into the 360.

Edit: and actually, no, not all xbox games work with the 360; [just barely over half](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360)",best game console
