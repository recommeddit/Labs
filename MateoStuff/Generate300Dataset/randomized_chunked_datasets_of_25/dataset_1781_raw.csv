"Obviously, the elephant in the room here is Deshaun Watson. The allegations and all were coming out as we were doing the ranking process. I instructed the rankers to rank him as they would since we didn't know all that was going to happen with Watson at the time. Over time, we've all started to see the person he really is and know more now than we did several months ago.  
  
I made the call instructing the rankers to rank his play on the field in 2020 but not trying to do more than that here with a fun write up or player card."
This is my dream
Favorite design wise the 4. However antenna gate sucked. In terms of functionality the 11 pro max.
"Gravy:
Brown 2 lbs of pork gravy, I like one hot,  one regular, GF likes one regular, one maple, that part it up to you. If you have some bacon grease in your fridge add some to the meat while browning. I don't know that it does anything..... but.... bacon. Drain the meat and set aside. In a fairly large pot combine milk and flour until you have a good ratio of gravy to sausage, (sorry I don't have any exact measurements, I always just eyeball it). Slowly bring to a boil! This part is crucial, you don't want to scorch the milk, however if you don't boil it it will taste ""floury"". Once it comes to a boil reduce heat and add the meat. Add salt and pepper to taste. My secret ingredient is a heavy spoonful or two of smoked paprika, that stuff is made by the gods I swear. 

Biscuits:
You can make homemade ones if you want, I've used Bisquick before. It's just too much of a hassle for me. I use Pillsbury homestyle or southern style cause fuck flakey biscuits. 

And that's that."
Who's punishing you?
"True about the return policy, except for that one time I had to return a door knob to HD. They said they didn’t have that door knob in their inventory. I argued that was ridiculous since I had just purchased it there a couple days before. Eventually they asked how much I paid for it and refunded me that amount. In the way home, it hit me. I bought that door knob at Lowe’s. HD doesn’t even carry that brand. I still feel like an asshole even though it was like 14 years ago."
why would not being broken down cause it to be antimicrobial? That doesn't make much sense to me.

The duo, consisting of [Rsonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsonist) (Gregory Green) and [Thrilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrilla) (Sean Thomas), rose to fame after providing beats to various releases of [The Diplomats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomats). The bulk of albums like [Diplomatic Immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_Immunity_(album\)) and [Juelz Santana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juelz_Santana)'s debut *[From Me to U](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Me_to_U)* were produced by The Heatmakerz.  Their production style is based upon hard equalized snares and kicks, strong bass lines, strong hi-hats, snares and often sped-up soul samples.  To this day, the Heatmakerz still use the same style of production. Timothy Hodge made an appearance on Beat Bangerz alongside [Rsonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsonist).

You could have just said you're not sure.  I just know that I've usually seen appliances last a LOT longer than 5-10 years but that was almost 20 years ago since I bought one.

Xbox all the way. I switched to ps4 when I grew up on the OG xbox and the 360. Now I regret my decisions. I mostly play PC now while my ps4 just collects dust.

I took years of keyboard lessons and it never stuck. I play the drums but I've owned 3 Hammond organs and currently have a '68 C-3 and a '73 Leslie. I haul it (and my Rhodes) around in my van just so my keyboard player can use it!
">	their Fakespot ratings are terrible


I used to be really worried about this, but not anymore. 

I figured out that actually, a lot of companies need to use fake reviews to prevent their products from getting buried. 

This is pretty much how it goes: many companies sell a product. Some of them get fake reviews. Other get fake reviews. The trustworthy ones fall behind, even though theirs are better quality. In order to stay relevant, they also need to purchase fake reviews, or basically all people stop buying their products. 

I would strongly recommend using Fakespot, but using it to see what the final score is like. Just because a product has fake reviews does *not* mean that it is a bad product. In other words, try to filter out the fake reviews and ignore them.

As far as Ugreen goes, from my research into them they seem to be more reliable than most other “no name, no brand” companies, although probably not as good as Anker and the like.

Edit: unless you mean that their reviews after using Fakespot are terrible, in that case yeah it’s probably good to avoid them. But don’t discredit a product just because it has fake reviews."

"I'm going to disagree with the people saying that textbooks won't be needed for class and add a ""sometimes"" to that. Some professors require you to bring your textbook. I'm a lit major, so all of my professors require it, but I've had some science professors require it too.

I would definitely get some kind of bag because you're going to want to bring a notebook and pens at the very least."
