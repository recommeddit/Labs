31343,best country to live in,"I still have yet to find an ""ideal"" country.

My main factors are good climate, quality of public transportation, and system of government. Ideally, that country would have expansive public transportation that makes cars almost redundant, a climate that's between Mediterranean and Maritime, and a transparent government that places high importance on personal freedom and peoples' welfare, and strict regulations on the economy. Any suggestions?

New Zealand might be pretty close, but it's too far away from... everything?"
