Stranger Things: The Game is pretty good and has about 5 hours of gameplay
Mischa Maisky. Bach Cello suites. My favourite.
"For something less high profile, try “Why Are You Like This”."
Cookies 'n Cream Oreos Style is my favorite.  Second favorite is Strawberry.
"That's the anthem, Uzbek swine."
"Yes, it's safe. It's supposed to be used together with uBlock Origin on Chrome / Chromium based browsers."
"I love the *concept* but how do you know how long (and at what setting) to do things for?    

For example a frozen pizza will say e.g. 425 for 16 minutes, how do you translate that into something the Pizza Pizzazz can do?"
"Personally I use `axios`, but a lot of people just use `node-fetch`."
"My mother in law was prescribed antibiotics (don’t know if it was her or the doc who kept pushing them) for YEARS, every summer for a constant bout of “strep throat”.  Then, she got very very sick, lost hundreds of lbs and we almost lost her.  A trip to an unfamiliar place and doctor told her that the antibiotics had effectively killed her immune system...oh and also she’s got celiac sprue...which is now 1000 times worse when she first got it *10 fucking years ago* because some asshole thought she was getting strep throat all the time, every year and just was like “huh, that amoxicillin didn’t work how about this vancomycin? Keflex? Chephalosporin? Azithromycin? Goddamn it, this woman is just FULL of what absolutely must be an AMAZING amount of staphylococcus!!”

Now she has to get hemoglobin transfusions and they make her able to fight off some sickness but then her autoimmune disorder kicks in and she has incredible joint pain. But she can eat. If she’s running low on hemoglobin she can’t eat but she’s not in as much pain.

Antibiotics are something everyone should know a little about beyond “it kills bacteria.” Unless they want to end up like my mother in law."
"Quentin Tarantino. Almost universally respected, amongst both casual filmgoers and critics alike. Acts like an insufferable 5 year old brat."
"Even if I know what's coming, the final ""stage"" of the twist never fails to be hilarious"
I hate the FIFA rankings but I guess there's not really any other better way to do it
"I went with the clear case because I liked the color of the midnight green and want to be able to see it.

i actually love blac chyna...i want her to win this thing
"We're talking about the fucking Wu-Tang Clan though,  a band that is so iconic that they are world renowned and their logo is instantly recognized by people from 6 to 60, white, black,  Mexican,  Asian,  all over the world. I know dudes born in the fucking 1950s that say Wu-Tang forever. 

Kendrick Lamar is best known for being a spoiled brat and chewing out a fan for not censoring herself with a word he used 15 times in one of his songs. I have no problem not using said word in everyday use, BUT if you pay good money to go to this guy's show, you clearly aren't racist, you're not going to go burn crosses in front of this guy's house, you love his music,  you should be able to sing a song that he is playing and you are a fan of. 

TBQH, this is one thing that has made it harder for me to get into hip hop in general. Could you imagine if icons like KISS or Metallica were to chew out their fan base for being immersed in their song?"
You guys would love Sleuth.
Can you explain what's so great about a mechanical keyboard
Goddamn I haven't heard march madness in like 4 years
I can't man I have too much responsibility  on my plate already :(
If you like to eat ice cream you are already an ice cream enthusiast
"Probably brio is the best webcam what money can buy, why u say is crap?"
"Dream house. 
Dude and his family move into a house. 
Weird shit happens and they find out the last family who lived there was allegedly murdered by their dad who is now in a psych ward place. 
The dad of the new family thinks the previous family's murderdad is stalking them and he goes to the psych place and finds out the murderdad has been released. 
He flips the hell out and goes to the police only to find that HE is the murderdad and he had a psychotic break after allegedly killing his family and made up a new persona for himself. 
He goes back to the house and realizes the family he's been living with are ghosts basically and the wifeghost keeps denying it because she can't handle it. 

Then they find out he didn't murder them, their neighbors ex husband hired a hit man to murder his ex wife so he could have their daughter. The hit man went to the wrong house. 


Crazy ass movie."
"For real. It’s arguable he’s the greatest athlete ever. Not all of that is football mind you so it could make sense why he dropped off the list but still, let’s all put some respect on his name."
"It’s the one big masterfully done end twists I remember ever seeing when I was still a kid. Not a single thing warns you before that moment. I remember watching it with my mother one night. I was a bit older and I was beginning my journey with well done “serious” movies, and my mum has always been a fan of stories involving murders and trials so we were just having a good time with an engaging and well directed (and acted) movie. I remember my mother saying “holy shit” out loud when Edward Norton started clapping and having my whole body covered in goosebumps. It was amazing."
"Good luck man, hopefully you find something that works, also don't be afraid to hold the new shapes in new ways. I used to use a Deathadder and now I'm on an ambi mouse. It wasn't a  huge change for me honestly but I hold the mouse in Pincer Claw instead of normal Palm like I had before."
