They do some absolutely brutal stuff to that man.

"This.  My Chrome messenger bag is practically indestructible.  $165, but I got the huge one (when I travel for less than about a week, it's the only bag I need), and I've definitely put it through some shit since I've had it.  As barry said, you'll need a sleeve for your laptop, but you're gonna be happy with it.  Plus the styling just looks great.  I've had mine for 3 years, and someone asked me last week if it was new - I'd definitely classify it as BIFL."
Ublock origin is considered the one to have right now because it blocks more. Ad block has a whitelist that let's some sites pay to bypass. And there's some other issue with ublock so everyone says get origin because it's from the original ublock dev just without extra bullshit that was added later.
"I've put a lot of effort into finding good modern science writing for insiders.  Until this thread, my best single source of leads has been the Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing, edited by Dawkins.  But its mostly popular writing by insiders.   I can't say that I've read a post-1980 scientific paper that has made me think ""This is well-written.""  Something happened after the 50s.  



From cognitive science, 

* I second George Miller's magic number 7+-2 and Herbert Simon's Architecture of Complexity.  
Adding:
* Tolman (1948) ""Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men"" http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/1948-Tolman.pdf
* Shepard, R., & Metzler, J. (1971). Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects. Science, 171(3972), 701. http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs1120-f09/ps/ps3/mental-rotation.pdf 



I also keep a collection of horrible sentences.   

* This is from the abstract of a paper on sentence comprehension: """"Arguments are made for autonomy of the lexical access process of a model of semantic context effects is offered."""" 
Swinney, D. (1979). Lexical access during sentence comprehension: (Re)consideration of context effects. Journal of verbal learning and verbal behavior, 18(6), 645–659.
* Here is another recent entry into the collection: 
http://enfascination.com/wiki/Weblog:A_snippet_from_my_collection_of_bad_science_writing
* And here is the worst I've seen:
""""A further - quite different - but potentially equally and in the long run probably even more important but also more debated stream of research is the recent combination of neuroscience with experimental and behavioral economics.""""
Riedl, A. (2009). Behavioral and Experimental Economics Can Inform Public Policy: Some Thoughts. CESIFO Working Papers, 1–37."
"If you can find spelt bread (i.e. Ezekiel brand in freezer section), this is a healthy breakfast option and very filling for me. I toast it then add some peanut or almond butter and half a banana sliced. Smashed avocado with hard boiled egg is a great option as well."
Or zip tie the pull ring of your grenade to the zipper. Surprise motherfucker.
Loved watching Paprika. I believe Nolan was inspired by Paprika when making Inception
I have them in audio form and have listened many times. I think it should be a prominent part of what we learn in high school.
My boyfriend wears Black by Kenneth Cole. It's sexy.
"Agreed and I feel you. Stickers or ""infitity skins"" are not acceptable on a 120 € product. If I would need to add stickers to my mouse to be able to hold it properly, then I would rahter just get a new mouse that fits me better."
"Nier: Automata

It’s very noobie friendly in terms of combat, while still being challenging, excellently written, and one of the best games of all time in my opinion."
"I can't speak for all Lowe's locations, but the one local to me in Pittsburgh is my go to if I'm doing a project that I've never tackled before. The folks they have there walk me through without having me spend a ton of extra money. 

If it's a project I've done before and know what I need, I hit my local Home Depot. I'm a huge DIY-er, so I know my way around both stores."
Is that too high? We’ve won a lot of games recently against decent opposition as well
"Yes! I'm like boardzy... I think artisan is always an upgrade. I've messed with a ton of other pads and every time there's an Artisan that's better. 

Aqua control, I'm happier with hien. QCK or GSRSE... I'm happier with zero. Glorious Ice, I prefer shidenkai. Raiden and otsu v2 seem to be unique, haven't noticed many similar ones out there to compare to those."
Oh my gosh I didn’t even think about that until now what the heck!! The movie has like the most realistic angst I’ve ever seen and I love it— gave me all the stomach butterflies. Ugh. Ruined.

Because he linked the wrong one. [Here ](https://youtu.be/KmtzQCSh6xk) is the actual one.
I've been using neovim lately and it's pretty great
"haven't seen this brand mentioned yet so i figure i'll throw them in: i wear the [komono clement](https://shop-usd.komono.com/products/clement-acetate-black-tortoise) -- these aren't the color of mine, mine have black metal frames and super black lenses. i got them on sale at a boutique for like $75 and i absolutely love them. i just think the shape is perfect on my face. before these, i had never spent more than $20 on a pair of sunglasses so it was a decent upgrade."
"I don't like the kardashians. I've watched maybe 10 minutes total of their endless amounts of shows, but their makeup... their makeup is amazing. I love their honey sticks and their bronzers and highlighters are great. And it kills me to admit it. But let's be honest. They're amazing at branding, and they don't put out crap. Very smart."
"I have friends who work in staffing and HR and they have told me the completely online colleges you see commercials on tv for might separate you from someone with just a high school diploma or GED, but won't come close to putting you on an equal playing field as someone with a degree from a non for profit accredited college.  

Im not saying legit colleges and universities don't offer certain classes online.  They certainly do, but the majority is still in the classroom I'm pretty sure.  Pretty much if you can't take the credits and use them to transfer to say a local state school (if ur in usa), it's not worth your time or money"
