"I love the JD Robb In Death series. 
I would love a friend to read it so we could compare thoughts and notes but it’s definitely a big commitment."
You cant leave soon enuf.
"I second the Sax being the easiest of the 5 or so instruments I play. The biggest reason is that it's monophonic, and unlike brass instruments, you don't have the concept of registers. One fingering, one note.

Really surprised more people aren't mentioning how much easier it is to learn an instrument that can only play one note at a time."
Technically it's a magazine. But I agree any way.

Sounds about right! Having a huge screen with lots of fingerprints can look terrible...
"Consider a cruise. http://www.vacationstogo.com/ 

Dollar for dollar, a cruise can be the single best bang for the buck, especially if you live in or near a port city. Always something fun to do on the ship, no worries about transportation during the vacation, and if you stay away from the buffet and stick with the restaurants on the ship ( not the high-end pricey ones, but the regular ones ) you'll avoid the crowds. Room service was free, last time I was on a cruise. I've had a good experience on Norwegian or Holland-America; mostly newlyweds and nearly-deads, hardly any annoying kids. No need to tip the room service until the end of the cruise. Depending on your budget, you can explore a new town every few days, or you can find a 're-positioning' cruise that crosses an ocean. Don't worry about the level of your room within the ship, you won't spend much time there, just get one near the middle of the ship. If you've never gone on a cruise, you really need to try it."

But there is always more modern JS that the browser doesn't support. I feel like Babel isn't just to get past ES6 but rather to keep using the latest syntax. Also there are a ton of fetch polyfills you could use: whatwg-fetch for instance."

"BBQ is really different depending on the region you get it in.  Your basic styles are the dry rub kind (Texas style), your vinegar base (I think this started in North Carolina), and your sweet sauce (I can't tell you where this came from.  I see it lots in Kansas City, but I've also heard it was a Tenessee thing).  If you really want a full BBQ experience, you'll have to travel around.  If you want to drive around slightly less, I know of a really good Carolina style place in Lawrence KS, so you can go from Texas and drive up to Lawrence, then head out to KC.

If you dig on American football, there's a few places that are ideal to hit.  Green Bay Wisconsin, go to Lambeau Field.  Good luck getting tickets, but there's some damn good tailgating and it's motherfucking Lambeau Field.  Despite the fact the team has sucked lately, heading to South Bend Indiana and going to Notre Dame campus isn't terrible.  The atmosphere is still killer and, well, Rudy.

If you want to be deafened by a crowd, head up to Seattle to watch the Seahawks play.  You might suffer ear damage.  As a bonus, you can hit the fish market while up in Seattle.  The restraunts are amazing there.

If you want something a bit different with your drinking/shopping/football, try and be in Texas for their State Fair.  You get a college rivalry game along with unique food, drinks, and goods.  The other state fair I'd recommed is Minnesota's, though there's not a crazy football game to go with it.  On the other hand, if you want to try and catch a baseball game, Minnesota is a fine place to be.  The new stadium up there is gorgeous and pretty reasonably priced."
">Dear Reddit: Are there any ""good"" politicians?

Senator Bernie Sanders.

Yes, and yes."
I wonder why some people don't get this!?? Every time I see my mom she asks me why I don't get my nails professionally done. I say because I like them fine as they are (I keep them neat and not too long). Plus I don't want to be infected by a dirty tool. Everyone I know who does the mani/pedis has a fungus problem with their nails; they try so hard to fix the problem but just end up covering with nail polish. Ew.

"I totally forgot about this encounter, but I've got to share now, since we're on the topic...

On my 17th birthday, coincidentally, one of my favorite bands All Time Low was playing an acoustic set at the little record store next to the mall. The show was completely free, and I spent my birthday skipping school and waiting outside the store to get a spot right up front. They played an amazing set, and afterwards, did a signing. During the signing, after I was reveling in the excitement of my signed ATL poster and awesome birthday, my friend told Alex Gaskarth (lead singer) that it was my birthday. Immediately, the whole band stood up, walked over to me, and sang me happy birthday. It was the happiest I had been in my entire life. Then, after they packed up their equipment, they took me to Tropical Smoothie. BEST BIRTHDAY EVER."
