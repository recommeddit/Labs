355,best terminal file manager reddit,"Dolphin mostly because of the feature which allows you to open a terminal panel in the folder you are in. I use it all the time to do quick operations on file or git commands.

Platinum

No order, that's mostly based on preference but every time someone asks those are the 3 that  come up most."
30724,best country to live in,"You just contradicted yourself. Do you honestly think that most people's lives are DIRECTLY related to who the president is. I mean taxes may change, and worse case scenario a war could start, but the presidents aren't exactly responsible for how happy people's lives are. Most people's lives in America are not going to change because Trump was elected."

54282,best medicine for a cold,"Zinc, administered with the once popular nasal gel, swabbed into the nasal passages, was the only accused culprit for losing the sense of smell. While zinc can be ingested as tablets, nasal gel, slow dissolve lozenges, or oral spray... nasal gel was used because the best absorption is via mucus membranes (nose and mouth) and you didn't have to worry about the taste.
I use Zicam zinc mouth spray and I take a strong Multi-vitamin during first symptoms of a cold and it seems to minimize symptoms quickly."
