"I think Coolstar made it to where you couldn’t get Sileo on U0, but I can’t remember if that’s the case"
Aw thank you for the nostalgic feels
"I should also mention that they love mysteries. I'm afraid of asking too many questions because I don't want to lead them into knowing I am getting it for them.

The Rebecca suggestion seems like a good one so far."
"You gettin' this, Vin?"
"There's plenty of research on shoes and the benefits of different types. 

There's just no research on the way shoes are sold (which is what your link discusses) . 

But then no one is saying that running shoe store salesman are equivalent to a GP either."
"Is hardstep the same as hardstyle? Hardstyle is great fistbumping music. Definitely gets you ready to fuck shit up in the gym. 

Or is hardstep a cross with dubstep? I’ve personally never been too into dubstep.. the robotic/grating drops just aren’t my favorite."
Never heard of that before. Is it much like mint?
Staedtler 925.  $11 or so on Amazon.  I just bought my kid one to do his homework with and now he's super excited when he has to do homework.
"But like... it is? Y'all settin' your standards for ""world famous"" too high. Knoebels doesn't have to be more famous than Billie Eilish to be relevant, hot damn. Loads of enthusiasts around the world know it just like loads of enthusiasts around the world know Holiday Park because of XGF. Phoenix is the #1 wooden coaster in the world, for Schilke's sake."
"i got these a month or so ago, they're great. (they are mislabeled as women's)   https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/1678028/smith-optics-women-s-marvine-rounded-sunglasses?color=TORTOISE+RED&size=OS"
"So within the past 2 years I have had Verizon (currently), T-Mobile and AT&T. I would rank Verizon ahead of AT&T but nothing major. T-Mobile had patches where I would lose service and I rarely had the same with AT&T and Verizon. I’m sure both would serve you well especially if you live within the city.  I live in Plano and travel to Dallas for work and I have 5G almost the entire way but for sure LTE the whole with Verizon."
Trombone.
"Two things I love pointing out about this story. 

1. Chamillionaire's refrain from cursing. ""I don't wanna curse. He was like 'I don't give a ffffff... Nigga!'""

2. He straight up admits MJ would've probably knocked his ass out."
"King sized candy bars.  When I was a kid, I always rode my bike to the nice parts of town and about one in ten houses gave out king sized candy bars.  :-)"
$92 @ amazon. Run price checks. :)

"Dungeon Raid, fingers crossed for an update at some point..."
"These are just my opinions but: anything other than blue/green, brown/clear and red/black might be too rare for a first-time buyer. Buckling springs are something I'd only suggest if you are a heavy typer (this is for the first-timers after all). Personally I also think this chart too easily tells gamers to get a linear switch. At first when I tried out a mx black board, none of my friends could see why gamers would even consider something like that. Of course, that's just me and my friends (more than ten people total) who all currently use rubber domes. It might just need time to adapt to that, but all in all I did find it a bit weird that it was so universally hated in that group."
"PC?

**Screamer**.

There have been more technically advanced games, games with better physics, games that look better but has there been one as mind-numbingly as stupidly fun? No."
San Juan Islands - WA

"Gotta blame the people who voted more highly for Buffalo Bill's single coaster than they did for Morey's Piers' seven coasters combined! None of its coasters cracked the top 500.

(that's kinda wild and depressing, huh)"
"I have a GoRuck without the external webbing. Big fan. Not sure if they still make them, unfortunately."
Edge
Hm. Sounds intriguing.
