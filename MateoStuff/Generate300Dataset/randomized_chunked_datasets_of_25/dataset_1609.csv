15512,best tree for the garden,"So guys, I recently moved in. The tree in the corner is a sycamore and the roots are doing damage to the walls. The sap it drops is gross also. 

I live in the UK in London and ideally I'd like a an evergreen tree to screen the garden off from the neighbours. It's south facing and ideally I would like it to have a smallish non destructive root due to the proximity of the walls. 

Your help will be appreciated ðŸ˜Š"

First step for me is to check the client's style guide / preference. Next step is to go to a dictionary \(pick one because usage can vary between dictionaries\). If it's an oddball term that the dictionary doesn't clarify, I go by what appears to be the most common usage \(wikipedia, google searches, well\-known competitors, etc.\)"
