55278,"Definitely not one of the major metros. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I have the impression that large cities on the east coast have a certain work culture that makes it harder to have the kind of flexible work schedules that outdoorsy people like.

Smaller cities may work well, such as Asheville.",best places to hike in the east coast

At least that's my take on the situation

That being said, it surprises me that notebook manufacturers don't use them as a way to differentiate their product.",best webcamera

29844,"Not at an app exactly,  but honestly making a Google doc sheet for this isn't to difficult.  I created one that does exactly what you're talking about that covers a year at a time,  the down side being that I have to manually enter the amount and timing on the bills and spending.  Once you've set it up it's  easy to maintain.  I've perfected mine over the last two years, and at this point it only takes a few minutes at the end of the week to keep it balanced, and since I estimate my bills on the high side at the beginning of the year,  I usually have more money at the end of the year than I plan for that I can use for anything I want.  I used other services but I didn't like the monthly views, and the lag between spending and reporting.  If my spreadsheet says I have 50 dollars and my account says 250 I know that 200 is spent even if my account doesn't know it yet lol.",best money managing app

14438,"1 - Sugar Daddy by Lisa Kleypas.  The whole series is fantastic, but this one is my ATF.  

2 - An Offer from a Gentleman by Julia Quinn.  This was my first Bridgerton novel, and I adored the “Cinderella” storyline.

3 - Unclaimed by Courtney Milan.  I love everything Courtney writes, but this one had me bawling the first time I read it.  I grew up in a super conservative home where I was taught that no good man would want an “impure” woman, so this really hit home!

4 - Untouchable by Sam Mariano.  Really just the quintessential bully romance IMO.  

5 - Hold by Claire Kent.  I remember reading this like ten years ago before it was revised and fleshed out.  RIP Ellora’s Cave. 

I based these off of what I actually reread.  I don’t reread most books, but these are what I do go back to.  There’s a couple others - The Lady Most Likely, or the Wallflower quartet by Lisa Kleypas, but I wouldn’t say they’re my ATF!!",best romantic novel
3940,"Yeah it is called Mickey mouse college and it's soley because you don't have to do any ""real"" research.  When I was working for my under grad I put in at least 300 hrs into research and the student's who didn't give a shit put in at least 100 hrs into research...  The whole idea of research is to train you how to think rather than to follow in the foot steps of others and hopefully that's what corporations want.",best online college

13197,"My husband gave me a spa day when our son was 12 weeks old.  Up to that point I had only been out a few times to the pediatrician, first time mom nerves kept me home.  This spa day was such a stress release for me I truly felt like myself again for weeks afterward.

And if she doesn't do the spa thing, just give her a Baby Day Off (breastfeeding may limit this).  My husband still gives me Saturday every week to just do what I want and our son is a little over 2 years now.

It’s the same way many pro you tubers love making content in 1440p or even 4K because it lets them splurge and talk about their workflow and how they need amazing pc setups for their use case even though in reality 99% of people watch in 1080 or lower.",best webcamera
