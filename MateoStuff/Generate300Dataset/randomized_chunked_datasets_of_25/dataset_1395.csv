70167,best major to study in college,"To a certain extent, yes. A lot of those fields are things where employers don't care about your degree, they want to see your portfolio. You may want to think about looking for internships instead. 

That being said, taking some classes and honing your skills and doing some networking isn't a bad idea. Look into community colleges - you can do all those things, get a 2 year degree, build up a portfolio, and not be left with crushing student debt."

16808,best pet for toddlers,"Yes, it is a bit unrealistic. Even the laziest dog needs to be walked everyday. If it is not exercised and/or properly trained, it will destroy things, act out, etc. There is no dog that automatically comes with perfect manners -- these things require daily effort and maintenance! 

You don't sound extremely into the idea of a dog. They aren't the sort of pet you can just sort of feed and ignore the rest of the time (like hamsters, fish, lizards, cats, etc.). They require a lot of attention."
