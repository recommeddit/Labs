"Specifically, Iced Cake Vodka. Tastes amazing and it doesn't burn."
Every Time I Die.
"Maybe setting/park is an influence, it's mostly hard core enthusiasts who have been on both. Just based on trip reports I'd say WWGLC is actually running better than Railblazer, it doesn't have the three potholes on the hill to the brake run."
"They make some really good running shoes. However, it is a matter of trying the *right* shoe. It's also worth noting that not every brand works for every foot"
A big meal!
"I use the Jansport Wanderer. It's like the Right Pack with the suede bottom, but it has a nice cloth water bottle pocket on the side. It also does pretty well in rainy weather as I've noticed."
"Just redid my kitchen cabinets in that exact paint!

The Game with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Had a mindsplosion all over the screen.
So you're a Bushman?
"The whole cast was pretty good, but Richard Dean Anderson was really the dealmaker on that show, in my opinion."
"for the ones i’ve looked at yea they are limited to urms and fgil students :,("
"I like Just Water and Voss. Just Water’s supply is harvested ethically, and the bottle is reusable and recyclable in some towns’ recycling programs. Voss’s bottle is reusable and washable if you buy the glass one, most plastic bottles are not good to reuse since they have a tendency to grow bacteria. It just depends on the type of plastic used whether or not you can reuse. Unsure if Voss ethically harvests their water or not."
Thank you so much. Got anything for audiobooks?

Does this site have University textbooks?
"I read Mumbai Mirror, almost first thing in the morning, its sort of daily routine. Actually, I feel uneasy in the morning if i don't read it."
"I'll soon come live in Canada from France, I can understand what you're saying totally but it still has great points imo!"
"Wait... you're saying you can't do proper error handling with fetch? And that getting back a parsed object is better than a serialized object (fetch has an easy to use string to object method)? Also pretty sure you can cancel and do progress bars (article says as much). And cookies can be done by setting just a one-line config property, I believe.

None of that stuff seems difficult to do with fetch."
"This is a terrible question and mindset. Conversely, so is picking a major solely based on what you like or for prestige. 

Pick a major based on WHERE you want to live and HOW you want to live after school. You could go learn a trade and love like a king in certain places, and you could get a STEM degree with honors and experience and live paycheck to paycheck. Any degree is only as valuable as you make it, and you make it valuable by maximizing your opportunity with location as well as living a lifestyle that fits the job and maximizes how you'd like to live. Example...medical or financial fields can make great pay, but you're going to have to get used to 60+ hour weeks."
"You can’t choose the best white colour because everyone’s taste and situation is different. You’ll want to try several samples. Get a piece of cardboard and layer a thick coat of your ‘top’ paints onto it, then bring it from room to room, natural and artificial light to see it.

When you buy white paint your first thought is the undertone. In bright sunlight it’ll show white, but in North-facing rooms or on cloudy days you will see the undertone. A blue undertone will show as a blue wall.

I didn’t want the undertone stress so used in tinted white and undertone-free grey.

Next is sheen. Ceilings are done in dead flat to hide unevenness, except possibly for bathrooms where you use a slightly higher sheen for a bit more moisture and mildew resistance. Walls are done in matte, eggshell or satin. I recommend matte or eggshell unless it’s a kitchen or bathroom as it hides imperfections.

Next is type of paint. You want something thicker as it takes fewer coats, with a lot of pigment, and that also has self leveller to keep you from messing up. I used SW Duration for kitchen and bath as it cross links well and is very hard wearing and scrub able and fairly mildew resistant. I used Opulence/Cashmere for the other rooms as it looks REALLY nice on the wall and is easy to apply. I used Pro Classic for the trim, easy. I used Eminence for the ceilings and hated it - I recommend you look elsewhere. I later used Emerald for a bathroom and really like it, easy to use, good coverage and looks great on the wall."
"I live in Michigan, and the tap water in my town is amazing. I live pretty far north of Flint though, so that may be why."
"I'll have to check out that one.

World of Goo is one of the few games I own on almost every platform. Never beat the game, but I can play it on almost any device."
Ah gotcha. Never been much for fantasy war stuff. I prefer the one or small group of adventurers in a quest.
