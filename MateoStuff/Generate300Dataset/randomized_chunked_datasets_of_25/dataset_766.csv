28305,best breakfast foods,"This time of year I get a bowl of yogurt, cut up a nectarine, crush some walnuts and a piece of rye crisp bread, add flax seeds and cereal until the bowl is full. In the winter I'll have oatmeal and applesauce.

I compliment this with either a peanut butter sandwich, a cheese and marmalade sandwich or crisp bread with cheese and cucumber slices. Always coffee and grapefruit juice.

45248,best gaming system,"Based on your game selection, sounds like you will need to make a decision. The last of us is on ps3/ps4, while mario kart is on nintendo systems. If you are looking for a more story/narrative driven experience, the last of us on ps3/4 is what you want, whereas if you want just something quick and possibly on the go, a switch may suit you better.

That being said, Nintendo is usually pretty user friendly, where ps3/4 is less so. (Its still easy to get into, I just find nintendo titles tend to hold your hand more as they are usually designed for kids)"
