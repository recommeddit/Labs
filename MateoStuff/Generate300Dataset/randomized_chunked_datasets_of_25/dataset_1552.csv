68582,"I think the issue is that there are those books that break your mind _right now_ (like Blindsight), and there are those that broke some older people's, and now their toolkit/theme is part of the genre, and widely known. Asimov is a great example of SF that was revolutionary at his time, some amount of scientific approach to problems was unheard of. But these days it's not a new thing anymore. Some books are only valuable for their historic context.",best science fiction novel

23706,"TM2 allowed one to turn off the visibility and sound of opponents, while TM Turbo does not. There are also only 2 camera view options. TM2 had 3 views but the most universally/popularly used one is omitted in this version. The settings are missing a lot of options that TM2 had (you can not even toggle motion blur...). The soundtracks start from the beginning of the track every-time you reset, which if you know anything about track-mania you know that would get annoying really fast. No dedicated servers or dedimania plugins, customization is much more limited (no horn, custom car models, liveries, etc), mods in general, the track-building is apparently worse. These things are a big deal as they fueled trackmania's dedicated community. That along with the 100 players cap, which it does not reach because of the shooting the multiplayer in the foot.

A lot of stuff has to come together to make seamless and enjoyable experience. When one of those are missing the experience can be greatly hindered. A lot of these omissions are due to consoles, as this was the first trackmania for consoles. IIRC a trackmania dev claimed that they making it for consoles but released it on PC so the trackmania community(which has exclusively been on PC) would not be left out. The two games provide a clear comparison of  console focused design choices and PC focused design choices. The console design choices simply was to omit a lot of features. I hope for the sake of the gaming community, developers, the industry, that consoles simply die off. They have been holding back the industry for too long now, but I digress.",best car racing video game
