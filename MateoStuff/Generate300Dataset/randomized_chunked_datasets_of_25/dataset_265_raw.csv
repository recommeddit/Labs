This stuff smells like sex in a bottle and I love it.
"The best I’ve been to is Universal Studios Orlando in Orlando, Florida, United States. Disney World (also in Florida) is a close second."
Also grab yourself some decent ram. At least 3200mhz cl16 or faster. Even better is 3600mhz cl16.
Incendies is brutal
Hell yeah
I just went to the one on Mass Ave last week! Having a couple month old puppy bound into my lap while I was crouching looking at paint is just what I needed
what..
"In that case, go for it. Definitely learn a framework. WordPress is popular, Drupal is what my dev team works with. Open source frameworks mean that you can just grab a module for the thing you wanna do, which makes everything go a lot faster.

You could just learn Ruby and Rails instead of PHP, which will probably be easy if you used to do java. It's not as specifically in demand but there's still a lot of sites running rails.

Django is cool but don't learn django."
"Bong Ra - Catholic High School Girls In Trouble [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQoDyIDBtCg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQoDyIDBtCg)

the dude is ex-metalhead, most of his stuff is breakcore, some mixed with metal ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5meue1C6o7U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5meue1C6o7U)). But this track is just fucking awesome hip hop"
"Thanks, this is really good one."
"France has a slightly different system in that the top schools are not actually universities, but *grandes écoles* eg. École Centrale, écoles des mines, supélec, école normale supérieure etc..

So the top schools may not actually be in this map.

"What size ultra wide have you go?

I have a 29"" and would say 3 files is comfortable."
The Tales Series and FFXV are two of my current favorites. I’ve sunk over 250 hours into FFXV alone. It does get linear for a bit at the end but you can use a special thing to go back to the open world at nearly any time.
Yeah I was surprised to see my university on here.
Blackout curtains for your bedroom.
"> Germany has quite the interesting and sordid past.

Vlad ruled over [Wallachia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachia) (southern Romania, not Germany)"
"I tried to read one of these and just couldn't get into it. I think the problem was that I started on the 9th book :P

I take it that you recommend the series, though?"
"""I currently have two contenders on my desk"" and NOW you're asking for advice? I hope I'm misunderstanding something, and you didn't just purchase and open two monitors at the same time, knowing full well you only wanted one of them at best. If so, you're literally the worst kind of customer and the rest of us pay for your entitled b.s. But again, maybe I'm assuming something wrong here. If so, then the above doesn't apply."

"The Surface Pro 2 charges at 42w, a Pixel 3xl charges at 18w but that power bank has a maximum output of 45watts.

So you won't have been getting max charging from both devices but enough to charge them even when under light use.

I'm not considering any under 60watts for myself because whilst my phone only requires 12w my laptop requires 95w.

It won't be too long before I get a new phone so chances are I'll need well over 100w to get maximum charge but about 60-80 to beat the light usage drain."
"Operations weren’t too bad when I went to Fiesta Texas, except food operations were terrible. Then again when I went the park was pretty much dead. I wouldn’t say it’s one of the least prettiest six flags though, probably second for me behind Magic Mountain as the prettiest. Also, finally someone else feels the same way about Iron Rattler as me. It’s my least favorite RMC. It’s still a good ride, but not that great."
"I'll be one to backup Jansport, bought my current backpack in 2011 and still going strong!"
"This is an extremely important thing to say. When I was young I adored my father. I wanted to do everything with him, and be just like him. One day in the car he told me ""In a few years you're not going to want to be seen around me. I know it's gonna happen but that's okay, I'll know you love me"". I was pretty much like, ""Thats never gonna happen dad"". Then I became a teenager and would come home and go in my room and shut my door and that was that.
Then right before I turned 16 my father was murdered. No special last words to him letting him know how much I cared.
Because he said what he said when I was younger, I have no regrets. He knew I loved him and I know he loved me."
You didn't by any chance snap this shot with a polarizer as well did you?  :D
