26778,"If you're looking for Value, card games are the way to go.

Star Realms is a great two player deck builder, head to head combat, with a quick play time, amazing replayability, easy to learn, and maybe best of all, it's like $15.

As someone mentioned, Bohnanza is great fun, light hearted table politics.

I see Agricola on your to buy list, but maybe look into Caverna instead. Agricola was the first really heavy game we got, and we still play it, but Caverna is usually our pick of the two.

But when we really feel like digging in, we bring out Terra Mystica. Such a fun game, I love the energy mechanic, all the races are similar enough that your comfortable drawing a player board at random, but are different enough to make them feel distinct. Expensive, but this is probably the game we've gotten the most enjoyment per dollar from.

Games like Xwing and Legendary or Netrunner can be great fun, but may end up draining your wallet.

For party games, One Night Ultimate Werewolf and The Resistance: Avalon are always hits, Sheriff of Nottingham is a recent hot game, and the classic Cards Against Humanity, if that fits your group's setting.",best board games

""#1 Guy!"" and drew pictures of a globe (for the world) and an airplane (because he likes airplanes) and colored them in with markers.

That hideous thing has been in a prominent place on a wall in my parent's house since the day I gave it to him (35 years). I have asked him several times when he's going to put that ugly thing away. ""Never.""",best gifts for dad

3954,"It really depends on where you're at. You should do some research for your state's library association and see if they have any job listing pages or resources. 

If you're not limited to one location in particular or you're not married to the idea of working in a typical library setting, it's a lot easier to find a position. The degree prepares you for a lot more than just the library field. It's basically a degree in research and ethical information management / dissemination. 

You can specialize if you know you want to go into a field that has more to do with archiving or serving a particular community or data management.  It's a great degree to have. 

If you're set on working in a specific library setting, it gets harder. I wanted to work with teens at a public library near Boston and lucked into my job where I built a teen services department. 

Don't expect to be a wealthy person if this is the path you choose. Library funding is scarce in the first place and jobs frequently get cut or reduced. 

I moved to LA and opted to switch careers because the market was very tough here at the time. 

It was a very rewarding time in my life but I don't think I'll be returning to that career any time soon.",best online college

2. Khloe- super hilarious. She seems really genuine and is always entertaining.

3. Kendall- she is kind of boring but I think she is real and seems more humble than some of the others.

4. Kim- obnoxious. Full of herself. Overrated. Can not understand the fascination with her.

5. Kylie- FAKE. She is so unrecognizable at this point that I can‚Äôt even stand to look at her. She is also overrated and I cringe at the thought of her ‚Äúearning‚Äù almost a billion dollars for makeup.. üôÑ",best Kardashian

3446,"Yeah. For Hopkins to move up, someone else needs to move down, and tbh, I don't see who would move down. Maybe NU, Brown or Dartmouth? But imo those are atleast as prestigious as JHU (outside of med/pre med), and I think it's up to the person at that point .

Penn is probably a bit more prestigious than Brown, but I also think Brown has it's own advantages. People picking between Penn and Brown don't need rankings lmao. And, Columbia could also probably be higher, but I think Caltech at 6 is pretty fair, so maybe 7.

If it was up to me, Stanford would be number 1 or 2 lol.",best college for research
