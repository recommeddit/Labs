Lol imagine teaching your national pastime to your colonies and convict outposts only for them to rise up and beat the shit out of u forever onwards 150 years later.
"My wife and I went to dreams Los Cabos for our honeymoon and we can't wait to go back for another vacation. It was fantastic! We weren't able to swim in the ocean because of the strong currents, but the food was excellent, the service excellent, the rooms are all excellent. I really have nothing bad to say about the place!"
Every nab rushing at chock points in Urban Terror shall read about Thermopylae.
"I found while working in one of the higher end hotels in my city that the really famous people don't want attention. At all. They don't want room service, or staff hanging around. Even the welcoming group of the GM and friends is a bit much, just go away and let them be alone. 9/10 times you would just hear video games or a movie from the room. They just want their alone time.

It's the D list celebs who know damn well they're not all that, that demand the attention. Likely to prove to themselves that see, they are important.

And dont even start on people whose biggest claim to fame involves ""twitter"", ""Instagram"" or ""influencer"". God damn parasites who expect to be treated like billionaires but not cough up a single cent."
"I like dolphin, the integrated terminal is slick. The directory open in the gui will automatically sync with the current directory in the terminal"
I want to see this.
I know a Biology PhD with publications in Nature that was getting $30k-$35k from an Ivy league school for a post doc because he couldn't find a tenured faculty gig. It's brutal.
P. S. The fact that you hang out in this subreddit is awesome. Tha KS for contributing.

"Dark on Netflix is a huge mind fuck of a show, it’s about time travel and multiverses and how no matter what you do to change the past everything is already predetermined"
"*The Power of Habit*: A+++++

I listened to the audiobook and couldn’t recommend it more"
"I just want playing an instrument as a skill, you know. Maybe play when I'm alone. Play for someone. Nothing too professional like for a band or anything."
"Most sacks, most tackles, most rushing yards, most passes completed....can do this all day."
I don't dunk and tell.
"Fact that nobody mentioned Brawl-Stars is crazy. 

Best F2P game i've played in forever, been playing for about 2 years now give or take, spent about $30-$50 over those two years and own literally everything in the game now.

I never grinded, just played a bit everyday or once in a while, sometimes i'll take weeks off before I play again.

All in all, for a F2P gacha arena fighting game, it really doesn't feel cash grabby at all whatsoever. As a person with a very disposable income, I feel basically zero need to spend money in the game unless theres a skin I want."
Maybe even too much. But I liked get out more.
"Armani Code, it's been my favourite for so long but kinda pricey. 
Elizabeth Arden - Pretty, is a second fave."
"Trick question, it's Jake Johnson"
My corned beef has always comes from a can because I only have corned beef handy on St. Patricks Day. I was also raised eating the canned stuff so that's just how it's supposed to taste to me.
"Alistair MacLean books are great adventures

Alan Furst's pre- and during WWII novels are mainly about people who find themselves taking on new self-imposed duties as the political situation deteriorates.

Helen MacInnes wrote Cold War spy stories where often amateurs got pulled in and had to improvise.

Dick Francis novels often this theme."
Thank you for this.
