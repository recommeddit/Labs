216,best terminal file manager reddit,100% agree... at the same time nnn just makes life so much easier once you set it up..just like git is phenomenal but so is lazygit....choose what works best for you...
23761,best car racing video game,"Ought to be Shift 2. The only game on PC which has a decent cockpit view for ALL cars (looking at you, Gran Turismo!) and you can put mods for pretty much any car you'd like.

In all honestly I dislike track racing (much prefer street/drag), but Shift 2 allows you to play with your favorite car and test it on the Nurburgring for example. Oddly enough, my fastest time on the 'ring was with a '70s Challenger R/T. Boy, it sure took a lot of time to master that beast, bone stock, 425 horsepowers of pure, unadultered fury!"
14,best terminal file manager reddit,"> I believe there are file previews via nnn plug-ins now?

Yes. There's also an option to invoke a plugin at startup. Otherwise, you can also have your own independent script that starts nnn in preview mode."
73089,best Linux distro,"Why Manjaro is my (current) favorite distro? 

Its like... well, I prefer to call for Pizza Delivery rather than make my own Pizza."

9020,best toothpaste,"Dentist here. I suggest you brush with a fluoride toothpaste for two minutes at least twice a day using a soft bristled toothbrush. Most people only brush their teeth for about 20 seconds on average.  The mechanical action employed using the proper brushing technique is more important than the brand of toothpaste you purchase.
Contrary to what toothpaste commercials show, the amount of toothpaste or gel needed on your brush for effective cleaning should only be pea-sized. Flossing at least once a day is also very important because it removes food and plaque from between teeth where even the best toothbrush and toothpaste are ineffective. Studies show that plaque regrow on clean teeth about four hours after brushing."
12281,best gifts for dad,"My dad is a mad-keen golfer so it never fails to get him a voucher to play at a random golf course. He's a member at our local links, so I always try to get somewhere 100km away or more so that he and my mother get to have a weekend away whilst enjoying 18 holes."
57192,best water brand,"A minor but important thing: the taste of your water might be tainted by the dish/dishwasher soap you use.

It sounds funny and might be outdated but to my detriment the taste discouraged me from drinking tap water. Bottled water wasn't really an option at the time so I ended up drinking a lot of juice and soda. :("
51464,best iphone case,Any recommendation of a specific model? One model seems very similar to Rhinoshield!
43651,best items under $100,"Good pens (Pentel RSVP 0.5, 2 for $6) for writing lots of notes in lectures."
63844,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,Thank you for this information! Highly appreciated.

65501,best phone service company,Creech - Verizon or AT&T. Any other service provider and you lose reception halfway through your commute.
71553,best movies with a cool twist,"Worst part about these threads is that a lot of these movies sound really interesting, but now that you know the twist, there is no point in watching them."
35260,best alcoholic drink,"When I go camping my go-to is a 1 liter Nalgene bottle with 100 mL of vodka tossed in. Holds your buzz pretty well, has the same ABV as beer and basically just tastes like water. Whiskey x hot chocolate is another good one around a fire."
67171,axios alternatives reddit,Doesn’t support streaming and has a cumbersome API though.
6868,best iPhone,"The 11 is a solid purchase. 
Bought mine 3 months ago and loving it so far."
54751,best water filter,Muh pineal gland!
42894,best detective show,Nora going to a different universe was her need for closure. She faked it but didn't fake it. Means she's lying to herself imo. It was so deep man. I loved it
1538,best ice cream flavor,"Quick google search for CryoJet didn't help me at all. Is this something I need in my life?

The carrot ice cream was one of the first recipes I searched for. It's already sweet, and to roast it or pan fry it before adding it to an ice cream mixture is something that appeals to me. Honey/maple would be nice - but so would caramel. I would eat that. 

How did the tasso ham taste?"
351,best terminal file manager reddit,"Krusader almost exclusively. I am trying to make it work as close as possible to total commander, but I have a long ways to go."
69578,best major to study in college,"My German professor said something similar. Before I declared a second major, he told me to find a comfortable bridge to sleep under."
44949,best items under $100,"An electric blanket. 

I genuinely felt like I could cry when I first got into a toasty heated bed. My apartment was so brutally cold in the winter and I didn’t have the money at that point to keep my central heating on all night. For the record, electric blankets aren’t expensive to run, and most have timers too."
8633,best toothpaste,By far the best answer from a dentist.
