"For the best binge worthy series in my opinion, from what you put in your post, I strongly recommend Stranger Things, Attack on Titan, and Sex Education. Oh and if you haven't watched Avatar the last airbender; it's amazing."
Then why do they even make the firm brushes?
What about Eau fraiche? Is that any good?
I actually really liked the beginning of Love Lettering but I feel like the book wasn’t concluded well for me unfortunately. I really liked the way the author explored the city though!

"Dental student here. Not sure if this will ever make it to the top of the list and get read, but here goes. 

If you look at most toothpastes, the active ingredients are really the same. With regards to keeping your teeth clean, it really doesn't matter which toothpaste you use as long as your technique is good.  I guess it sounds weird, but there are techniques for toothbrushing. At school we teach the Bass Technique. The best video I found was for the [modified bass technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqCpZm6s_dE), which is pretty similar. The optimal situation would be brushing twice a day (with any toothpaste), flossing once a day, and visiting a dentist or hygienist every six months to make sure any buildup you missed (that is now calcified since it has been there so long) is removed. 

I always get the toothpaste that I like the flavor of, because then I have more of a reason to brush.

Now if you have [sensitivity issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentine_hypersensitivity), then you're going to want to get a toothpaste like Sensodyne or anything really that has potassium nitrate in it. The potassium will form salt crystals that will essentially occlude your dentin tubules on the exposed dentin of your sensitive teeth. There are some other formulations that can help with sensitivity, and if it is a continued problem you should go see a dentist. 

As others have pointed out, Colgate total does have the antibiotic [triclosan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan) (like many other household products). Now I like Colgate Total, but like I mentioned above this really isn't the root of the problem. If you only brush once a day and do a poor job, no amount of triclosan is going to help you. The nature of the microbial biofilm reduces the effectiveness of things like antibiotics anyway (they can't penetrate very deep into the biofilm). 

TL;DR - Get the one you like the taste of, learn the [proper technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqCpZm6s_dE), brush twice a day and see the dentist once every 6 months."

"At Lowe's I had to register at customer service and provide my dd214.  I guess they must have had an issue with fakers or something.   However,  now I just give them my phone # and show my retiree ID and it applies my discount and emails my receipt to me, which is convenient."
"1. You could probably get away with one piece, but unless someone is giving out larger candy, generally two or three pieces per child. Generally, it's more important that you give all children the same amount of candy- kid's won't mind if one house is a bit stingy, but they will mind if their friend gets more candy than they do. Of course, even this isn't that big of a deal.
2. I recommend dropping it in the bag. Giving kids free reign of the bowl is opening yourself up to some kids fighting to grab more. 
3. Honestly, no idea. I don't have much experience in actually purchasing candy (all my knowledge comes from experiencing distribution on the side of the trick or treater or distributing candy at home, but in the latter cases I was just doing it for my parents, and have no idea how much they actually gave me to hand out) This is also going to vary on how busy a neighborhood you live in. 
4. Turn on the lights. Unless you are in a VERY busy neighborhood, you probably won't want to leave the door open continuously. If you want to try sitting out on the porch and handing out candy, some people do that, but generally those are the kind of people who get really into the holiday, as opposed to the people who simply answer the door when people come and watch TV in the meanwhile.
5. My advice? Don't stand by the door. If you can, just hang out in a front room, and do something else simultaneously- watch TV, read a book, browse reddit. The kids will knock or ring the bell, then go to the door, give them candy, close the door (unless another group is close on their heels, in which case waiting a moment is probably a good idea). Eventually, the number of kids should die down, or you'll run out of candy. 
6. And finally, just turn off your lights. You will probably get a few kids who try your door anyway, but just don't answer. They'll assume you're out of candy if you don't answer. However, when you're done distributing, try to make it look like you're not home- you could very well annoy someone if you're just hanging out in a front window in plain view but aren't answering the door."

"Fedora and openSUSE Tumbleweed, both with GNOME, are quite beginner-friendly and never look dated. The only exception is with the installation part, specifically with partitioning. If you have no plans to dual-boot, I think you'll encounter very little problems installing Fedora/openSUSE.

I only recommend Ubuntu or any Ubuntu-derived distro like Linux Mint when NVidia comes into the picture. On the contrary, based from my experience, Ubuntu's support for AMD graphics card has been lackluster even with distros based on it like Linux Mint and elementary OS (which I both used for quite a while)."
"I'm surprised to see that a lot of people use fetch. When I tried it, chrome kept caching some weird SSL errors that could only be solved by using xmlhttprequest. Honestly I didn't do too much debugging, but ever since my negative encounter, I've just kind of thought of fetch as not production ready yet. 

Personally I use axios for backend stuff and xmlhttprequest (with a small wrapper I'll usually write custom for each project) for frontend, although when fetch becomes more stable, I'd love to move to that (and use it on frontend/backend so everything's uniform)."
