54482,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Thank you! Love this collection. Grats on your future hien, you'll love it!

1. The hien is going to be a good bit faster than what you're used to. IMO you'll adjust rather quickly and the low static friction will be a fantastic upgrade for your tracking ability. The stopping power will be a bit of an adjustment, but muscle memory will kick in eventually.
2. Viper mini with stock feet might be a little scratchy on hien, at least mine was. Swapping to core pads was really helpful on my viper mini. I think they're in stock on lethalgaming gear and it's by far the easiest mod as you just peel off the stock ones, clean the surface, and add the new pads. That being said, it's very usable, just a bit scratchy. 
3. The hardest question! It was the hien for a long time, but hayate otsu v2 took the crown though I love all 5!"
51924,best iphone case,I agree. I saw a lot of posts complaining how they changed the material to a cheaper leather and it doesnâ€™t age like the older Apple leather cases. Iâ€™ve had older Apple leather cases that I loved so I bought the Golden Brown. As soon as I took it out of the box you can feel the difference compared to the old cases. They feel cheaper and overall lesser quality. Iâ€™m planning on returning it and going with Nomad or Woolnut instead.
28606,best breakfast foods,"A poptart contains 219 calories, and very little else and cost 41 cents per pastry.

Eggs are somewhere between $1 and $3 per dozen, contain 90 calories per egg and cost 8 cents each. 

So a three egg omelette every morning worth 270 calories would cost 24 cents plus a nominal amount for fat to fry it in, or about half of what a poptart costs. 

I suggest you begin to buy your own basic foods and cook breakfast, it'll taste much better."

8455,best toothpaste,I had a friend whose parents allowed 0 sugar in the house. She said she'd take the Tom's toothpaste and hide under the dining room table so she could eat it out of the tube... I can't imagine being so desperate for something sweet that I'd eat toothpaste to get it.
63759,best books for building better habits reddit,"So implementation intention is a good one. Willpower is a finate resource so making things simple and automatic are important when creating habits for the times when you have no energy motivation or willpower. 

BJ Fogg from http://tinyhabits.com/ does this implementation intention thing by creating a cue in your daily life which acts as the trigger for when you start your new habit. For instance putting your running shoes by the front door when switch off the downstairs light before you go upstairs to bed. The cue or hook is something that you already do habitually at the same time that you want to create this new habit.

Check it out. Powerful stuff.

Lastly I will say that willpower is great but I think it still can not help to motivate you entirely when you feel that there is no strong purpose for doing what it is you are attempting."
12446,best gifts for mom,"When I worked at Staples, I ordered one of their Christmas calendars that you can put your own pictures on. I filled each month with relevant family members. She cried.

58723,best cologne,"No, you could have sprayed more and it would have been longer and projected more. I went easy with three sprays two on each clavicle and one on the wrist which I dabbed on the other wrist. 5-6 sprays would more than likely be perfect."

4327,best text editor,"I'm a bit shocked to hear your reasons ""two killer features."" I've never used a legitimate text editor (beyond notepad.exe) that didn't have regex support, and you can add any program to the context menu regardless of what it does automatically. Combined with the negatives you list initially, I'm struggling to find the logic in your recommendation."

22278,best celebrity,"Robin Williams, we were out with my wife's Grandmother at Universal Studios.  She's a huge fan and was practically giddy with excitement when she found out he was there.

Just so happened he walked past us and she called out a hello, and wished him a good day.  He tipped his hat and said ""Thank you kindly, Ma'am"".  Classy guy, and made her day. :)"

73187,best Linux distro,"I'd either go with Linux Mint for rock solid stability and Long Term Support (LTS) or Manjaro which is every bit as easy to use as Mint but has a rolling update model as opposed to Mint's fixed upgrade model.

&#x200B;

When you do the installation, I highly recommend that you setup a separate /home directory.  That way if you want to distro hop then you won't have to back everything up each time and you won't lose and custom app settings you've made (all configuration files are stored in your /home/username folder."
