"Halloween living on a short street: 

Sometimes you buy expecting a lot of people, and only a few show up.  If you are the only house on that street giving away candy, people will likely stick to the main road."

"I recently listened to an Econtalk podcast talking about this issue - [Scott Atlas on American Health Care](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2012/07/scott_atlas_on.html). 

The guest's thesis was that the US has very high health outcomes and the reason has lower rankings in some surveys is because it is more diligent about its reporting. For example, any newborn that dies within the first week (IIRC) is always reported as child mortality, where many other countries will not report a child mortality if the child dies within the first 48 hours.

Another example had to do with automobile fatalities. If someone gets in a car crash and is basically dead from the accident they are still taken to the hospital, attempted to be saved, but if they die it impacts the hospital's mortality rate. Even though they were DOA and the hospital had no chance to save them they still get counted as a patient that died at the hospital. The guest was saying that if you subtract automobile fatalities that our hospital mortality rate goes from like 15th to 3rd, or something. (I don't recall the precise details, listen to the podcast, it's interesting.)"
