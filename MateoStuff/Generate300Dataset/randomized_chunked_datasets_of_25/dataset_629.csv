11283,"Can I give you one piece of unsolicited advice? Share your stories. Share them early and often. My whole life growing up my dad would tell me stories and I'd love them, but I would always say ""Dad, you've told me this one!""

He died when I was 16. I half remember some of his growing up stories. I wish I knew those stories better. I wish he had told the stories more often. I wish he had shut me up and repeated the stories.

Also, keep a journal if you can. You never know what might happen.

Dad used to hint at stories for ""When in was older"". I'm 30 now and I wish I knew stories about my father's drug use and his wild drinking tales. When I was a kid he didn't think they were age appropriate, and my mom wasn't around for most of them. I get why he didn't tell me those stories when I was twelve, but now I'm so curious. He had a big falling out with his brother and never kept in contact with his ""pre-marriage"" friends enough for me to contact them.",best gifts for dad

25815,"Also just by the stats in that graphic. 00's Australia had a win rate of 68.9% to 80s Windies 52.4%.  Australia did lose more tests rather than draw them (loss rate of 15.6% compared to 9.7%) but if we're talking Dominance it's about how often you win not how often you don't lose.

Also, just from a non-numbers argument, the Windies were stacked bowling and Viv Richards (as far as all time greats go) where Australia had Warne/McGrath for bowling (could also almost include Brett Lee as well, good cricketer, maybe not all time) and usually 4 or 5 of their top 7 in the batting order in any given test match (Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Waugh, Waugh, Hussey, Gilchrist) were all time greats.

Any of the Curcurma sp. seem like good choices for the medicinal qualities. I am growing Curcuma caesia, Curcuma aromatica, and Orange Tumeric. I wanted to grow Kava, but was unsure where to start and which strain would be any good. I was thinking of getting it from Logees, but don't know much about the potency and how decent the strain is.",best tree for the garden
