5442,best home improvement store,"All about the customer service of the specific stores close to you. 

As a general theme I prefer Home Depot for more convenience with online stock tools/receipts and better tool selection. Lowes seems to do better on appliances though."
11283,best gifts for dad,"Can I give you one piece of unsolicited advice? Share your stories. Share them early and often. My whole life growing up my dad would tell me stories and I'd love them, but I would always say ""Dad, you've told me this one!""

He died when I was 16. I half remember some of his growing up stories. I wish I knew those stories better. I wish he had told the stories more often. I wish he had shut me up and repeated the stories.

Also, keep a journal if you can. You never know what might happen.

Dad used to hint at stories for ""When in was older"". I'm 30 now and I wish I knew stories about my father's drug use and his wild drinking tales. When I was a kid he didn't think they were age appropriate, and my mom wasn't around for most of them. I get why he didn't tell me those stories when I was twelve, but now I'm so curious. He had a big falling out with his brother and never kept in contact with his ""pre-marriage"" friends enough for me to contact them."

29912,best money managing app,"I like using YNAB, it's about $5 per month though, but been using it for years now and it's great. It connects to your bank account and once you're use to it, its amazing.

I've also heard Mint is good, and you could try Personal Capital, thing PC is more of a spending tracker, not sure."

5002,best home improvement store,"Same here.  HD carries maple lumber and generally better kiln dried dimensional lumber.  I found that they have a better selection of tools.  Lowes carries a lot of designer lightning fixtures, ceiling fans, and faucets.  Also found that they carry better paint supplies and accessories."

Worst case scenario you won't care that you are sick. 
Best case you are feeling better.

25815,best cricket teams of all time,"Also just by the stats in that graphic. 00's Australia had a win rate of 68.9% to 80s Windies 52.4%.  Australia did lose more tests rather than draw them (loss rate of 15.6% compared to 9.7%) but if we're talking Dominance it's about how often you win not how often you don't lose.

Also, just from a non-numbers argument, the Windies were stacked bowling and Viv Richards (as far as all time greats go) where Australia had Warne/McGrath for bowling (could also almost include Brett Lee as well, good cricketer, maybe not all time) and usually 4 or 5 of their top 7 in the batting order in any given test match (Hayden, Langer, Ponting, Waugh, Waugh, Hussey, Gilchrist) were all time greats. Brad Hodge couldn't get a spot!"

15526,best tree for the garden,"Dragon Fruit and Cherimoya fetch nice prices. Moonpurr, you growing any Cupassu or Theobroma bicolor? I am planning on growing the two out in FL sometime soon. Was going to start from seed and plant in the warm microclimate areas of the yard.

Any of the Curcurma sp. seem like good choices for the medicinal qualities. I am growing Curcuma caesia, Curcuma aromatica, and Orange Tumeric. I wanted to grow Kava, but was unsure where to start and which strain would be any good. I was thinking of getting it from Logees, but don't know much about the potency and how decent the strain is."
5310,best home improvement store,"[The Shutter Store](https://www.theshutterstore.com/). We got plantation shutters from there. If you're even a barely capable handyman, you can measure for them, send out the order, wait a month or so, then install them yourself for 1/10th the cost of even just ordering from somewhere like Lowes ... and you can get real wood instead of plastic for that price."
19101,best YouTube video,"Pitch Meeting is so great, makes me stay subbed to the channel despite literally every other piece of media on there is pure stinking garbage. Really is one of the worst channels out there, just so intrusively stupid and so clickbaity they must think every watcher is a slobbering moron. 

Would be great if he got to move it all over to his own channel, which also has some neat stuff, but I guess they've got a contract he can't easily break."
