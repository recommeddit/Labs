31944,best hotel to live in,"I'd call up Marriott directly.  Chase reps don't know how the cards work or the loyalty programs, they're not educated on the cards like we are.  A lot of times when they asked why you want this card, many people would tell the chase reps something new they didn't know.  Their job frankly, is to push the machine to manually approve you if you're a risk.

Most other hotel programs for example, Hilton give you gold, but require you to start at the bottom if you want Diamond through stays.  Same with starwood, the only program that doesn't do this is club carlson, where if you already have status they will give you 10 nights towards keeping it.

On my hilton account, it shows I have hilton gold, but my stays this year have so far been 0 this year so it shows 0 stays, 0 nights, not 40 as I would have with gold.

Also, you can have status programs without a credit card.  I have Hyatt and Club Carlson accounts, most people who aren't churners earn points/status through stays and not spending."

35419,best alcoholic drink,"I really really need you to try it with heavy mint and light lime. It may change your life. 

Take a large handful of mint leaves in your glass, muddle them up just until well bruised, but stop before you start tearing leaves. Try and use the whole inside surface of the glass to middle leaves against. Then muddle well 1/6 of a lime into the bottom. 

Add ice, rum, a pinch of kosher salt, simple syrup (I use demerara syrup for added body) and mix together, then fill with soda water. Squeeze another 1/6 lime slice on top. 

Stir by dunking your bar spoon 2-3 times into the glass, trying to not float too many leaves on top. 

Take a 2inch sprig of mint, clap it between your hands twice to express the oils and make it fragrant, then insert into a cut lime slice to use as the garnish, so you can smell the mint leaves while drinking.

The drink focuses on mint, and uses lime for acidity to cut through the bitter from the mint. It's balanced, super refreshing, and can handle a LOT of rum before it tastes too strong."

26827,best board games,"1. Nice list! You do play a lot of games, not sure I managed 20 different ones last year.
2. OOooo Faiyum. Im debating (in my head) if I should get rid of Concordia in favour of this. Not much of a euro player (my favourites being Age of Steam and the 2 Brasses), and this looks to be more to my liking.
3. 18Chesapeake is my 2020 favourite. It was my first 18XX play and I was so happy with how it went that I started making an app for 18XX games. Now I consider myself ""a 18XX player"".  Will probably get my self to some train convention once things clear up."
