16805,"I wish your wife was in this thread: it honestly doesn't sound like she understands what she's asking for, and how far off it would be from the reality of owning a dog. 


Small dogs tend to not be good with kids, AND tend to bark. They're not good with kids because they are small. It's really easy for a kid to accidentally seriously injure or kill a small dog. Lots of small dog breeders won't sell to families with toddlers, for just that reason. 

If you have a dog who weighs upwards of 50 pounds, you usually know where the dog is. And if the kid steps on the dog, the dog won't die. If you have a dog who weighs 7 or 10 pounds, that's a dead dog if the kid steps on the dog or drops something on it. And if you're getting ready to leave the house, it's far easier for a Maltese to dart out the door than it is for a Lab. 

All dogs are destructive unless you train them. Small dogs tend to not be as trained as big ones, because people don't take them seriously. They can't take apart a couch or a kitchen as fast as a big dog can, but they can still destroy things. And if you want a dog who pees on a pee pad, then get ready for 10 or 15 years of your house smelling like dog piss. 

I have a friend who's wife really really wants a dog. They have three kids, and an incredibly over-subscribed life. I know that in their head they're seeing the kids come down the stairs on Christmas day, and finding a puppy with a bow on it. I tried to tell them that the dog is not going to be all about that, but I suspect they'll go to some pet store and buy a dog. 

Anyway, dogs are like toddlers that never grow up. if you train them, they're not bad to live with. If you don't, it doesn't end well for anyone involved. As I said, if your wife was in this discussion, I'd ask her why she wants a dog, and what she hopes to get out of the relationship. My experience is that unless a kid really LIKES dogs, there is very little interaction with the dog (way more with the Xbox or whatever other electronic crap is in the house), and the kid is just not that bonded with it.",best pet for toddlers

Ok, Courtney Milan is amazing. The Duchess War, especially, but I also LOVE Unclaimed.

Bec MacMaster writes big stakes, epic fantasy (and sci-fi) and some of the best sex scenes I've ever read. Highly recommend her London steampunk series.

Sarah MacLean's Rules of scoundrels is also fantastic and I love the little universe she's built with that and her Love by numbers-series.
