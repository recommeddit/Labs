"I agree, never meant to say they sound awesome just one of the better ANC headphones. Personally don't like the sound of the Sony XM3/4 too bassy and shrill for me. Kind of odd considering I like how the WF-1000XM3 sounds."
I bought an awesome backpack from Eddie Bauer when I started high school. 3rd year of college and it's still going strong.

"The blue banana just looks like it follows the path of the Thames and the Rhine, which makes sense."
"The Mote in God's Eye is set years after a cataclysmic event that nearly wiped out humanity, and the culture that survived has in some ways become very conservative, reflecting militaristic Victorian-era morals.  These morals are never really questioned throughout the book, which to modern readers makes it seem like the authors personally agree with it.  I'm not sure that's actually the case (although Pournelle apparently had strongly conservative political views, so who knows)."
I consider The State v. Radric Davis to be the most essential if I had to pick one.
"> Which distro is the best depends largely on what software you will be running on your Linux installation.

This statement goes a long way to determining which distro to choose.

It's would be almost impossibly for me to advise without this knowledge but I can tell what we use and why.

Debian was chosen as our distro of choice for servers for a number of reasons:

* Nearly all the software we run is in house developed, so Redhat's support for the most part would be useless.

* Debian has an package management system which is IMO is much nicer to work with than Redhat or similar. We host our own local repository and often add patches distributed packages to suite our needs.

* We have a really tight SLA for critical issues which Redhat etc... would never come close to meeting

* Debian is stable, ok it might not be the most up to date distro but problems are few and far between.

* Developers like to run Ubuntu on their workstations (although we don't restrict them). Porting updated packages from Ubuntu to Debian is relatively easy.

* The money we save by using Debian means we can hire good sysadmins that really know their stuff who don't need to rely on support from someone else


I have rely on support from a alot of 3rd party companies as part of my job as a result I spend far too much time on the phone getting them to fix things. Stuff that should take 5min to fix will take days + lots of jumping through hoops. In my experience the community support I get from Debian is far far better than any commercial support I've had to deal with.


All that said then it's always down to the needs of the business. What ever you choose then do so wisely."

"Robin Williams.  Met him when he came out to Iraq for a USO tour, 2007.  Was willing to sign anything and talk to everyone.

I worked nights, so I couldn't make it to the USO show, but he stayed in the VIP rooms directly next to my work building.  So in the morning he stayed to say whats up, show his appreciation and even gave us a quick piece of the set he did for the night prior.

Also met Kid Rock who was cool AF!  Lance Armstrong was a douche."
