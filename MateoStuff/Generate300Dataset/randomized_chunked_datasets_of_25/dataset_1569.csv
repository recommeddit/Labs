45449,best gaming system,"Games,  games are primary case of choosing gaming system (exclusives of wii are reason I have wii, exclusives of ps3 are reason I have ps3, exclusives of switch are reason I have switch, exclusives of PS4 are reason I have ps4, emulation/mmorpg/exclusives of pc is reason I have pc (add:and ofc some games feel much better with KBM and pc power than with consoles))"
23673,best car racing video game,"came here to talk about forza horizon 4 too, I think that the car upgrades are more limited in what you can get, but the car tune is very good, also having more than 750 cars in a single game gives you a lot of stuff to tune..."
52306,best hiphop album,Just out of curiosity - what albums in your opinion deserves more to be on this list and which shouldn't be there?
16832,best pet for toddlers,"I cannot emphasize this enough. When parents look at getting their kid a pet, they need to look at it as *themselves* getting a pet. Otherwise it will end in heartbreak one way or another.

My husband had a hedgehog as a kid, when he was about 6 years old. My MIL told him, a six year old, if he didn't take care of it she would give it away. Of course a *six year old* couldn't remember to do things like clean it's cage often enough. So she gave it away after he became attached to it. He still remembers that sadly while she seems proud that she ""taught him a lesson"" about caring for pets."
64424,Best Nike running shoes,I think New Balance and Adidas are worse.... it's going to be fun to try and do this for their shoes now :)
17901,best Kardashian,"Kourtney’s my favourite, most of the time idk why. Least favourite is Khloe cos of that fake baby voice & the whole ‘True needs a sibling’ excuse"
25916,best cricket teams of all time,2010s should be South Africa.
32544,best vacation resort,"Bali is an amazing island. My SO and I went there 3 years ago now and had the time of our lives. We lived like royalty for 10 days, and we didn't step foot inside an all-inclusive resort.  
  
The street vendors and local restaurants are all great for eating. The food is safe to eat, and it's ridiculously cheap. For about $5 we both ate lunch and had drinks. For about $20 for dinner, we got two appetizers, two dinners, two alcoholic drinks, and two smoothies.  
  
When we went we spent a few days in Kuta and enjoyed the hustle and bustle, went to Uluwatu temple (I think it's known as the ""monkey temple""), went to lembogen island just off the coast, and got a nice relaxing day in a spa. Lembogen island was awesome because we went snorkeling but more because we toured the local village and learned about their seaweed farming and silk weaving. I bought a very large, 100% silk hand made sarong for $5. In America that same quality would be around $50 I assume.  
  
We also toured some villages on our way to Ubud. We visited a wood carving village, a jewel crafting village, where my SO picked up a pure silver ring with an emerald for $50, and we visited a plantation type place where they grow spices, coffee, and cocoa trees. I tried Kopi Lubak, which most people know as monkey poop coffee. The Lubak is more like a weasel to be honest, but I digress.  
  
Ubud was awesome as well. We didn't have any plans when we got there, it's a quieter area, not as touristy. We rented a scooter for $6 per day and tooled around the island on that.  
  
I would definitely recommend you take more time than we did, at least 2 weeks. You can't drink the water cause it's much like montezumas revenge, locally called ""Bali belly,"" but after you get used to it you're fine. The water is hard to avoid, because it's used to wash all of your food and brush your teeth, and obviously ice. I bet the resorts probably have filtered and treated water, but the. You never leave the resort.  
  
Have fun on your honeymoon!"
2333,best headphones,The XM4 has better ANC but the M3 sounded much better to me.
46974,best hand santizer brand,"I was expecting something much cuter (for some reason) when I saw ""water bears."""
27069,best board games,"It's impossible to do it fairly. Since someone might have a list where they feel their #1 is waaaayyy better than their #5, no brainer. Or someone might feel like their top 5 are neck and neck and just kind of edge each other out barely, and could be easily in a shuffled order. Do you weight their rankings the same? 

A scale of 0.0-10.0 to rate games is a better solution, and then your personal #1 would be your highest rated game. But then how do you make sure everyone has the same idea of scale, and what a 5.0 or 8.5 is?

So since you can't do it fairly, the best way to do it is transparently (like here), so people can make conclusions while still understanding how you ended up where you did."
41499,best instrument to play,"Piano.

Guitar is definitely more portable and convenient, but piano is the daddy of all instruments. Nothing even comes close."
35946,best alcoholic drink,"Pro Tip:


Go buy some lime juice in the fake little plastic limes you find at the grocery store.  Squirt a couple squeezes of lime into the natty ice.  The acidity and small amount of sweetness will take the edge off of the bitterness, and you can pound those puppies.


I have good taste in beer, but I can choke down 4-5 natties with some lime juice if I'm trying to cut."
43052,best detective show,True. I meant more like there’s not big bad or conspiracy. There’s little bits each episode to flesh out the characters. But if you watch a single episode it makes as much sense as it would if you’ve seen every episode.
51889,best iphone case,No wobble at all. It was very unexpected and a pleasant surprise. I ordered it because it’s one of the most popular and highly recommended cases year after year. I may still try the Ringke Onyx though.
34992,best NFL player,Excellent list.
68750,best science fiction novel,"Oops, you're correct about ""The Windup Girl"", though I could have sworn somewhere I saw it as being translated from the original Italian. Oh well. And your opinion of ""The Three-Body Problem""? Okay, we'll have to agree to disagree about that one."
48068,best color to paint with,You're really worked up about this. Maybe you should take a break?
54305,best medicine for a cold,"Yes, cold whiskey tastes like antifreeze. Give it to us waaarm, and tingling."
44401,best items under $100,"At my rate, 0."
4153,best online college,"Attending AMU personally.  They have helped me do things such as work on a resume, got me into an apprenticeship program relating to my degree and took a bunch of elective credits based on being a submariner E5.  If you do any research, then yes some places do not personally like for-profit colleges while others do.  Difference in for-profit is the lack of focus on general education and more on specialized.  I do agree that a non-profit, state college-type-thing that also has an online program generally looks better.  However, AMU and Excelsior are both regionally accredited schools and are further accredited in specific programs by boards that mean something.  The most important part is to do research on that school prior to committing.  For instance, AMU got sued by the state of either Massachusetts or Pennsylvania (I cannot find it currently) for their failure to disclose post-completion employment data.  They did not lose their certification.  While I also agree that  for-profit colleges are a business, either way you are paying for a product.  WGU is another example.  They are regionally accredited  and their online teaching program is also one of the only online accredited ones.  I also know people at the company that I am apprenticing with that got their degrees through AMU as well as connections through sites like LinkedIn.  Online for-profits are generally more flexible with schedules as well.

TL:DR 

Do research and haters gonna hate on online college because they paid more or took on loans for their brick-and-mortar degree. A degree is mostly a check in the box and you need networking and experience.

Edit: There are pros and cons to for-profit and non-profit.  Research.

Edit 2: Graduation rates seem to be lower for online for-profit schools as there is less interaction.  If you are good at teaching yourself it may be for you. Results may vary."
62486,Best RPG game on PS4,I liked AC Odyssey and The Witcher 3 but thought Horizon was a bit shit.
11742,best gifts for dad,"Let's have lunch.  I would rather spend a bit of time with my kids than get a gift.

Edit:  Thanks so much for the gold.  Happy Father's Day!"
