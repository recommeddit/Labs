"I love my biochem major, but I am constantly drawing / creating things in my free time. I'm sure I would've had a great time in the art field"
You mean football ?
"I also recently went from a TV to only monitors. Even that is IMHO better, but not as much as going from a shitty monitor to a good gaming monitor.

So if your TV has good colors and contrast, it's still better than cheap monitors. IMHO.

But no where near as good as 144hz g / free sync."
GTA V and Skyrim
Yes! Flowers in the storm is a favorite of a lot of people. Also her medieval series is excellent.
Sorry but I was advised to never do math.
Lurisa spring water.
Surprised nobody has said Lucky Number Slevin yet. I'm usually pretty good at seeing twists coming (not necessarily knowing what they will be) but that caught me so off guard.
Test Drive!
"Two of my recent favs..        
Victoria's Secret Crush & Victoria's Secret  Love"
Yeah might need to go over $100 but a really good chef’s knife is the best/most useful present my wife and I got for our wedding 11 years ago and still gets used everyday
He says “very few” I’ve never read it but it may not have as many as you would like. Mostly a human war. Apparently.
"Do I need fluoride toothpaste if my local water already has added fluoride? Not a conspiracy nut, just curious."
Black skinhead is my deadlift song.
I like it a lot. It has the same vibe as tobacco vanille and spicebomb extreme to me.  It feels more round to those though. I feel like it lasts for quite a long time in the radius that I want it to be in. I actually prefer that it doesn't project like crazy. Same reason I like pretty much everything else in my list other than maybe Y EDP.
Wool socks.
"PDFDrive is my favorite, I usually find anything in it."
"Computer science, Electrical engineering, or the physical sciences...but more importantly get a good internship and acquire useful skills as a student. My husband and I both work in STEM areas and have such a hard time hiring. We desperately need students who know how to do something useful coming out of undergrad, and those skills just aren't really taught in the classroom. Make the best of your education by learning how to apply every summer."
Is BBB something other than the Better Business Bureau?
"Github is the most relevant. Twitter is a common one, just follow the tools you use and retweet + comment on updates they release.  Keep your LinkedIn up to date, as well."
Don't let him grow a moustache!
"My plan is to major in Motion Design, which is a combination of Graphic Design and Animation, at a very successful school. They have an employment department that assists graduates in finding great jobs, and I believe the employment rate for grads is around 90%, so I'm not worried. You should chose a profession that interests you, not what's only going to pay the bills. What will save you in money will cost you in happiness."
"I did my undergrad at the U of South Dakota. It's a good school with a PhD program in many subjects, but far from a D1 school."
"Had this happen before, the restaurant was booked for a private event and this guy felt he can do anything he wants. The chef was working on some stuff food projects and this guy went into the back opened it up and ate it. when i confronted the guy, he  kept on throwing out that he's the nephew of a famous actor, and i kept on asking him and who are you? but i don't think he got it that he's a nobody not his uncle."
"Doom soundtrack, whoever on here that said thankyou to somebody else for mentioning it, thankyou"
