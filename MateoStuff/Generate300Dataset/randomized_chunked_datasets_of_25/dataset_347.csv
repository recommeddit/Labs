4828,"I mostly stopped shopping at HD about 20 years ago.

Wife and I needed an over-the-range microwave. Went into HD, looked at all the displays, and found one we liked for like $225. Told the clerk we would take that one and he says it has to be ordered. I said fine, we weren't in a hurry. That is when he tells us there is a $75 delivery charge. I said that shipping to the store was fine, but he said the charge would be the same either way.

So, frustrated and not willing to pay an extra 33%... we ask which ones don't have to be shipped. He walks off to his terminal and looks around for 20 minutes only to come back and tell us that all of them do. 

So despite having an entire bank of displays, they don't have a single one they can sell without a $75 extra charge. We complained to the mgr to no avail and ended by telling them to fuck off.

We drove across the street to Lowes, picked one out. Clerk pulled it for us and loaded it right into our car.

I know it won't break them, but I would guess that $75 has cost them about $60k in the years since then (we do a lot of house work).",best home improvement store

71337,"I was browsing the comments to find your comment, because Arlington Road was the first movie I watched because of this post. I just wanted to tell you that in my opinion it was like Secret Window for a weird reason. Both had interesting plots, I was sitting on the edge of my seat all the time UNTIL the twist happened. Both had really bad twist in my opinion. But still, it was so much better than Secret Window. At least I had a 'holy fuck' moment when he found it the bomb was in his car. And the other 95% of the movie was one of the most interesting stories I've ever seen. Too bad the twist kind of ruined it. It could've been a 9/10, but the twist had no build-up at all, even if I know how the bomb got into his car, so it's a solid 7/10! Thank you for the suggestion, I really enjoyed it! :)",best movies with a cool twist

16419,"Hello again, quick follow-up to /u/mcqueenofthehill's [Street Style Sunglasses Inspo Album](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/hc25mk/sunglasses_streetstyle_edition/).  It's fantastic content, and will probably be more useful for most, but as the village idiot, I think we should also have an inspo album for **POWERFUL** Sunglasses.    No weak shit.  No Ray-Bans.  No Warby Parkers.

Some brands that come to mind:

* [Percy Lau](https://www.percylau.com/)
* [Micromega](https://www.micromegaeyewear.com/)
* [Jacques Marie Mage](https://jacquesmariemage.com/)
* [Mykita](https://mykita.com/en)
* [Masahiro Maruyama](https://masahiromaruyama.com/)
* [Rigards](https://www.rigards.com/)
* [Kuboraum](https://www.kuboraum.com/)
* [Rick Owens](https://www.rickowens.eu/en/US/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Sunglasses)
* [Gentle Monster](https://www.gentlemonster.com/)
* [Godsomware](https://www.instagram.com/godsomware/)
* [Retrosuperfuture](https://retrosuperfuture.com/)

This album is just the tip of the iceberg, and if you find anything that you think should be in this album, let me know and I'll add it.  I strongly encourage you to browse through the other offerings of the brands listed above (and others).  Sunglasses can be something that you protect your eyes with, but they can _also_ be really awesome accessories and accent pieces!  Be dope and wear dope shit!",best sunglasses for fashion
