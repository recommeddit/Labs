7794,best laptop for general use,"Hi! Looking for the best school (casual) laptop around. School work, casual social media, 
youtube. Price is not a factor. 2 biggest things I'm looking for is durability and longevity. If I'm spending this much money, I would like it to last a long time or have a great warranty. I was looking into 2020 MacBook Pro, but I heard they can be a bit fragile and costly to repair.

Any thoughts? Thank you so much!!!"

3361,best webcamera,"With DSLR you need a dummy battery(assuming your DSLR is common search for the model name of your battery with the words dummy battery and it will popup online)... to bypass the powered on limit.

The only reason to be using DSLR is if money is not an issue or you already owned one, if you want a way higher quality, depth of field and 60fps. If you do not really care about those obviously its way simpler and way cheaper to just be using a webcam - exactly like you said its just plug n play."
32351,best hotel to live in,">Now though, in the era of Internet, crowd sourcing is often the most reliable way to judge somewhere. When hundreds of people on sites like TripAdvisor say a place is overpriced and terrible then it doesn’t matter what the official book says. And if a one-star hotel gets nothing but praise from 90 percent of the people commenting? There’s your consensus of rating right there.

This, absolutely. Now it's the five star reviews that actually count."
