47798,"I have the Ti-89 Titanium and it's fantastic. It made Calc 1 and 2 easier. It's great for Calc 3, because you can change between rectangular, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems easily. It's also capable of just about any integral (provided it's even solvable in the first place), partial derivatives, 3D graphs, some differential equations, and implicit differentiation. The button layout isn't too great, and input is intuitive (It's very similar to Mathematica and MATLAB). If you're going into electrical engineering, there's even a spot in the calculator specifically for EE related things, like Fourier transforms, impedance, etc.

Go ahead and take your sister's Ti-84 though. Some professors in college do not allow the Ti-89 or similar on tests (or sometimes no calculator at all), because of just how good it is. I think it's also the only calculator you cannot use on the ACT if that means anything. I got a used one on ebay for $76 a few years ago, and it was like brand new, so I essentially got it for half off.",best graphing calculator for vector calculus

That‚Äôs interesting. So if pH is different throughout certain brands can that be an indication as to whether a water is purer or lesser? In the UK there‚Äôs certain regions that have hard-medium-soft water but I don‚Äôt know the entire basis of what that means.. Apparently hard water isn‚Äôt as good compared to soft for some reason.",best water brand

50486,"Replying to your comment so you can see.  So today I listened to The Chronic and 2001 both for the first time, and I've gotta say I don't know what I was waiting for.  On the first listen, I thought both were good, not great (but I mean, both have alot of tracks and one listen is never enough to fully absorb all an album has to offer).  So I definitely will have both on repeat in the near future.  First impressions is I think I liked more songs and the lyrics better on The Chronic, but 2001 deserves every accolade it's gotten for production.  The songs to me lyric wise were a bit more forgettable, but goddamn the production was glorious in my headphones, definitely gonna reply this one to see the tiny details in production, and along the way I'm sure the songs overall will grow on me.  All said and done, I definitely still see Dre's production outshining his raps, but both albums were well worth my money and I'm glad I finally listened to both front to back!",best rap album

64431,"Wow, yeah. That is really confusing.

Generally, the way it works now is that the last two digits indicate a shoe category (stability[x40,x60,x70), neutral [x80, some x90 ], racing [xx00], etc) and the first digit (or two) is how technical the shoe is. Under 6xx is gonna be your budget shoes, 8xx is mid range technical, 10xx and 12xx are cushioned, 14xx and 15xx are your racers.

The way it was first explained to me is to think of the last two digits as a speedometer. As you get closer to ""100"", you get more neutral and performance oriented.

Of course there are weird exceptions and shoes that don't cleanly fit into categories. (I'm looking at you 990 and 840)",Best Nike running shoes
