18140,I don't know whether to believe Kendall threw money at the waitress. She seems sensitive and down to earth on the show.

24553,"1. Gurren Lagann - An over the top mecha series that I like to describe as ""fucking awesome"". Every time I watch this show it feels like I'm a kid again, constantly cheering during its hypest moments. Fun characters, amazing designs and visuals, and the heights this series goes make it something truly special for me.

2. Hunter x Hunter - Great characters, a fantastic power system, and amazing strategic fight sequences make this my favorite shounen of all time. I believe the chimera ant arc to be one of greatest out there, and is a big reason why this is a big favorite of mine.

3. Gintama - A comedy that likes to parody a large variety of other anime. This show has some of the most lovable characters I've ever seen in a show. The jokes are very over the top and creative, leaving me in tears most of the time. While it is primarily a comedy, it can be anything it wants and still be amazing at it. One such area is action, and it has some damn good fight sequences.

4. Serial Experiments Lain - A psychological thriller that explores the implications of an Internet-like world. There is a more personal reason with why I fell in love with this series. I am very interested in technology, and how it effect society as a whole, and this series deals with that at its surface. Dwelling even deeper this series has so much more to say, and is rich with substance. Despite its low production value, it has amazing atmosphere and sound design, and had me at the edge of my seat throughout its entire run.

5. Kara no Kyoukai - A series of movies that explores with the psyche of messed up people with crazy powers. My kind of series. These movies have some of the most incredible visuals I have ever seen, with some of the greatest music ever put to an anime.  Also I am in love with the setting of dark urban Japan in the 90s.",best anime
