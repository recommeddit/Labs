64788,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"so many choices.... ok I'll break them down by style:

Japanese: Arigato Sushi

Mexican: Los Agaves (sit down) La Super Rica (tacos, informal, cash only)

American: Lucky's (steak, $$$) Brophy Bros. (seafood, on the harbor)

French/American: The Lark

French: Stella Mare's

Italian: Ca' Dario, Pascucci

Pizza!: local favorite is Rusty's but I prefer Gino's (more east coast style) and if you want Chicago style Patxi's does amazing deep dish.

Brunch: Cajun Kitchen, Bree'osh, Jeannine's, FisHouse

If you can't decide what to eat try the Public Market with a beer garden, wine grotto, and everything from tacos to ice cream and thai street food!

There are so many unique and amazing places to eat you won't even break the surface with being here for a long weekend. But please try!"

47238,best state to visit in the United States,"There are three places to go for barbecue - the Carolinas (pulled pork), Kansas City (all kinds of meat, sauces are what it's about here), or Texas(brisket). Anywhere in the south will have good barbecue, you just need to get out of the tourist traps is all.

Personally, for what you asked for, I'd go to Austin, Texas. Good barbecue plus it's a younger (age of people-wise) city and it has a vibrant night life, and all the things that come with that. Plus you're in Texas and can do a lot of stuff that you can't do in England, or other places in America even, such as go to a range and fire a machine gun (if that's your thing). Also, football in Texas is super fucking serious business. High school football teams will be on the same scale as professional events with stadiums and all the rigmorale.

Nashville, Tennessee is also a pretty cool place that has good barbecue and a decent night life, although a lot of it revolves around country music (there is a huge music scene in Nashville), so if that's not your thing, then you might want to go elsewhere.

New Orleans is an awesome place to visit in the Spring/Summer, and since it's located in the deep south, barbecue will be available and delicious.

Dallas, Texas has barbecue, an awesome football stadium, and ~~casinos (which are like grown-up theme parks).~~ However, it also has some serious violent crime rates. You probably won't be in any danger, but definitely stay alert.

Be weary of any suggestions in the northeast for barbecue (coming from someone in NJ). It's really not the same."

72271,best adblocker extension,"From the GitHub page, so words from the creator of the extension:

>uBlock Origin is **NOT** an ""ad blocker"": [it is a wide-spectrum blocker](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode)  \-- which happens to be able to function as a mere ""ad blocker"". The  default behavior of uBlock Origin when newly installed is to block ads,  trackers and malware sites -- through [*EasyList*](https://easylist.github.io/#easylist), [*EasyPrivacy*](https://easylist.github.io/#easyprivacy), [*Peter Lowe’s ad/tracking/malware servers*](https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/policy.php), [*Online Malicious URL Blocklist*](https://gitlab.com/curben/urlhaus-filter#urlhaus-malicious-url-blocklist), and uBlock Origin's [own filter lists](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/tree/master/filters).  
>  
>uBlock Origin (or uBlock₀) is not an *ad blocker*; it's a general-purpose blocker. uBlock Origin blocks ads through its support of the [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). uBlock Origin [extends](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters. Furthermore, advanced mode allows uBlock Origin to work in [default-deny mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-default-deny), which mode will cause [all 3rd-party network requests](https://requestpolicycontinued.github.io/#what-are-cross-site-requests) to be blocked by default, unless allowed by the user.  
>  
>That said, it's important to note that using a blocker is **NOT** [theft](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/518154828166725632). Don't fall for this creepy idea. The *ultimate* logical consequence of blocking = theftis the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.  
>  
>Ads, ""unintrusive"" or not, are just the visible portions of  privacy-invading apparatus entering your browser when you visit most  sites nowadays. **uBlock Origin's main goal is to help users neutralize such privacy-invading apparatus** — in a way that welcomes those users who don't wish to use more technical, involved means (such as [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix)).  
>  
>*EasyList*, *EasyPrivacy*, *Peter Lowe's*, *Online Malicious URL Blocklist*  and uBO's own lists are enabled by default when you install uBlock  Origin. Many more lists are readily available to block trackers,  analytics, and more. Hosts files are also supported.  
>  
>Once you install uBlock Origin, you may easily un-select any of the  pre-selected filter lists if you think uBlock Origin blocks too much.  For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only *EasyList* enabled by default."
