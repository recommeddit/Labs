68427,"World Made by Hand by American James Kunstler was pretty good. Station Eleven was fantastic; I stayed up all night reading that one. Oryx and Crake was entertaining but I don't think it was all that deep; Handmaid's Tale was the kind of book that I sometimes have creepy dreams about and wake up sweating. The Road is iconic -- I read that one in the woods at night and got so freaked out that I hid from the fireflies. A Boy and His Dog is also, I mean, Harlan Ellison, dang... his short fiction is so weird and so warped. You can't go wrong with short stories by Ray Bradbury or James Tiptree either. Plus Tiptree is so feminist, I can't believe nobody figured out he was a woman for so long. Akira is like the most epic manga ever, plus the art is amazing. It took me forever to read because I spent so much time looking at all the details in the pictures.

Hm, maybe I read too much apocalyptic stuff... I think that Liebowitz was what started it back when I was in high school, plus I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.",best science fiction novel

46219,"Don't give out Dum Dum pops.  I hated every house I went to that gave those out.  All I could think was ""Really?  You couldn't spring for the Tootsie Roll pops?  Maybe the mixed bags of name brand candies?""

I still hate dum dums.  They're just so cheap and awful.  When I want to give an analogy of something cheap and low quality I use Dum Dum pops, so I don't actually have an analogy for them.

10107,"Whichever sketchbook you get, it's best if it says 'acid free' on the cover. That has to do with the longevity of the paper. You will also want to take note of the poundage. The lower the pounds, the thinner the paper. I like 90lb. & above. (for reference, tracing paper is 25lb.) 50lb. is so thin I feel I will rip the paper.

As someone else said, Strathmore is a good brand. Might also want to pick up some newsprint. It degrades quickly but it's super cheap & is used for studies. I saw a newsprint pad that was $2 for 100 sheets. Don't buy Royal Langnickle. It's cheap but you can't erase & it is not acid free.

For pencils, well, I don't like how graphite smears. (my first few sketchbooks were a mess & I could barely see what I drew) I recommend picking up a pack of Mitsubishi colored pencils that are 1/2 red & 1/2 blue: http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Mitsubishi-Vermilion-and-Prussian-Blue-Pencil-5-5-Hexagonal-Body-Pack-of-12/pd/5161 or Prismacolor Col-erase: http://www.prismacolor.com/products/colored-pencils/col-erase .

Neither of these will smudge. You can undersketch in a light color & tighten the lines in a darker color. Both have hard pigments so you can get them to a nice point. Plus, pretty colors! You can sketch in aqua & purple or pink & red or whatever, & it's just delightful.",best pencil for drawing
