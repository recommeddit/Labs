Toby Hemenway seems to believe that you can firewall off the walnut by planting resistant species between the walnut and at-risk plants. I know he mentioned mulberry for this."
35405,best alcoholic drink,"I love this! My boss actually shared a similar recipe, but they use honey as well, whiskey instead of everclear and drink it hot whenever they get sick! 

Question though. When you say ‚ÄúOn the stove, boil some with like a cup of brown sugar‚Äù how much cider are you talking about roughly?"

37588,best Marvel movie,"What I posted earlier

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I'm being honest.

&#x200B;

Infinity War is the blame for some of Black Panther's backlash.

&#x200B;

Both directly and indirectly. Seemed more time spent/resources to fix CGI on IW than BP. Also think story wise BP being the film before IW it forces them to have to tidy up everything at the end.

&#x200B;

However, also the fan reaction. People seeing critics and GA laud BP so much when 2018 was supposed to be the ""Year of Infinity War"" That was the movie that was supposed to be the highest domestic movie ever (at the time). That was the movie that was supposed to be nominated for several oscars. It was the culmination of everything and once the BP hype kept going and going it seemed pick started to nitpick the hell out of it.

&#x200B;

I'll also add that even though I think IW is just ""good"". Black Panther is partly the reason IW didn't score as well with critics. BP was so character focused, so theme heavy, etc. That all the Infinity War shenanigans just seemed less intimate and loud."

10954,best backpack for college,"I'm not a huge Northface fan, I think most of their stuff is overpriced for marketing, but I love my Recon pack. Hiked around Turkey with it and never had any problems with it, and it's definitely nice enough to carry around for college, and it comes in a lot of different colors to boot."
47404,best state to visit in the United States,"Football is ubiquitous in September, from high school to college to the pros. The heart of football culture is in the South and Texas, but there is a game nearby literally everywhere on Friday night. 

The best weather in August and September, though, is found in the Pacific Northwest, as well as several National Parks. I like Redwood National Park, but then I'm biased. If you want to spend some time in nature, it's hard to beat this region.

As far as cities go, Chicago, New Orleans, and Seattle would give you three varied urban experiences. Washington, D.C. has some amazing museums and landmarks."
