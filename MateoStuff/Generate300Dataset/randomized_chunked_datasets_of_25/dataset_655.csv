&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If I'm being honest.

&#x200B;

Infinity War is the blame for some of Black Panther's backlash.

&#x200B;

Both directly and indirectly. Seemed more time spent/resources to fix CGI on IW than BP. Also think story wise BP being the film before IW it forces them to have to tidy up everything at the end.

&#x200B;

However, also the fan reaction. People seeing critics and GA laud BP so much when 2018 was supposed to be the ""Year of Infinity War"" That was the movie that was supposed to be the highest domestic movie ever (at the time). That was the movie that was supposed to be nominated for several oscars. It was the culmination of everything and once the BP hype kept going and going it seemed pick started to nitpick the hell out of it.

&#x200B;

I'll also add that even though I think IW is just ""good"". Black Panther is partly the reason IW didn't score as well with critics. BP was so character focused, so theme heavy, etc. That all the Infinity War shenanigans just seemed less intimate and loud.",best Marvel movie
