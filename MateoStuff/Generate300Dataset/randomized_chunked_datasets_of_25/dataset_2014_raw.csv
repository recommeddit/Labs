">I always find myself leaving Lowe's and going to HD because our Lowe's is run and operated by idiots, who don't know how to do their work,  constantly screw up, and also don't care about a customer a single bit.

I used to frequent Lowe's after one bad experience at HD with an asshole employee. Just at a bad time I guess. I've since experienced their employees are more knowledgeable in my area - or at least try to help in some way.

Over time I got sick of the know nothing and holier than thou attitudes at Lowe's. Every one of the Lowe's in my area are seemingly full of the type of employees that post in r/lowes."
"My old wrestling coach would play some badass songs
Mother-Danzig
Bad Company-Bad Company
Till I Collapse-Eminem
Slither-Velvet Revolver
Then at the end he would make us run until we would sing alone to Sweet Caroline (BAH BAH BAHHHH)"
I'm getting dad pepper plants. He likes peppers and he likes taking care of shit. For $50 I could get a whole set up going
Thanks! Ill be studying JS more rigourously now.
This is common sense not a tip at all
"Li-Ion batteries have a lifespan of roughly 3-5 years, depending on usage. You won't find anything that lasts significantly longer than that, so try to find something with a decent price/performance ratio without spending a fortune.

There is no BIFL portable charger."
This is in the guide.
"226 south Milpas for East Beach tacos, it’s at the batting cages. 730 north Milpas is The Shop."
"Never trust glass in rooms. GRAs are so stretched thin on time that they will clean the glasses with the same rags they clean the bathroom, after all their goal is to make the room look clean.

I worked as a GRA in a five diamond for years and there was over a year period that went by where we didn’t get a clean glass delivery. We didn’t have dishwashers in the room, so management was complicit. This was in a five diamond, one of the top resorts in the world. Never trust glass in hotel rooms."
Give me dat peepums nasty gum any day.
It does sound like something to hide your porn sites.
"Great!

I like a fine piece of ash.
"Business, Nursing, Engineering, CS/Information Systems all seem to be decent choices in my area. It definitely fluctuates though because I recently (again, in my area) a lot of teachers have retired and replaced by younger ones. These young teachers won't have to retire for another ~30 years or so. This makes the teacher job market a little rough."
"I'm looking at the ASUS Vivobook (S513) 15.6"" laptop for my daughter right now - 8 GB RAM, Ryzen 5-4500U, 512 GB SSD. It is priced $799 Canadian, which is pretty good for an ""ultrabook"" - just wondering if anyone had any experience with these laptops.

I'm looking for a sweet spot that is 8 GB RAM (preferrably upgradeable to 16 GB) with a minimum 512 GB SSD and NOT an i7/Ryzen 7 processor. I've done a bunch of research and found that for the most part, i7/Ryzen 7 processors are a bad idea in a small laptop because they are constantly overheating and are throttled down to the speed of an i5/Ryzen 5 anyway - so why spend more for those? 

This ASUS looks like a good option for about the right price."
Grey. Specifically Dunn Edward's Minors Dust. It's a gorgeous color that picks up different lighting really well.
"When I worked out consistently, it was always HHH's or Brock Lesnar's WWE theme song on repeat."
The original season 4 is so smart to me because as you get further into it you start seeing the past episodes happening in the background and they make more sense and simultaneously you are also hearing what you saw in the background in past episodes. It would mean nothing though if you don't catch them going on silently.
Opera lots of good features
"Witcher 3, mass effect trilogy, Dragon quest xi"
"What about school and multimedia use? The reason I'm asking is that my previous hp spectre (2017) died because both ports burned out and I would have to replace the entire motherboard since everything is soldered together. I just wanted to see if there's a better deal than the spectre laptop. My laptop had uhd display, 512ssd."
"Have you read the Gentleman Bastards series by Scott Lynch? The sequel, **Red Seas Under Red Skies**, is actually my favorite of the lot precisely because it's so much like an Ocean's 8-11 heist. :)

It is criminal heist, but has great found family and a good amount of self contained plot to each."
"I just got a new monitor that is 1440p at 75 Hz so I'm not worried about keeping high fps, especially because I sometimes struggle to keep 60fps in mw right now anyway."
I would say 800 Canadian. I am just having a hard time finding it in Canada haha
"On average, yes."
