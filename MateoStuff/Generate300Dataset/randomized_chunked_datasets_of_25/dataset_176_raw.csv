"Considering the fire hazards of poorly designed lithium batteries, I would not get a battery pack not made by an established company: Anker, Mophie. Asus, Xiaomi, Energizer and so on.

Also, do not buy from Amazon as they have a big counterfeiting problem and doing almost nothing to combat it."
"How is nobody talking about Chris Morocco!?

I love watching him try to reconstruct food after just a brief, blindfolded inspection. The way he uses his senses and categorises everything fascinates me, I love his quirks.

Overall they captured lightning in a bottle with the lineup they have there - every one of them is a likable, kooky, larger than life character! It's like a sitcom cast, but they're real chefs."
"Today I found one of those lights that miners use to see that they put on their heads. It wasnt a helmet and light, just the light, but I can definitely see using that light to fix problems with a car much easily"
"Yeah, definitely a FatFIRE recommendation. The highways were closed on the road to get to the Inn a few years ago, so they were helicoptering people in from neighboring cities"
Agree! It was so good!
"Invictus by Paco Rabbane. 

Trust me"
I'm a big fan of Bleu de Chanel and Spice Bomb by Viktor and Rolf in the winter.
"I brought it up to my team but they don't see it as an issue, they only see it as rework. I don't know much else to say to convince them!"
"it became a distraction and people complained about it because other people kept asking about it but yes the words ""camera shaming"" were used ""/"
I just went to Hersheypark and it's one of the best parks I've been to. I went to SFGAdv a few days prior and it pales in comparison.
"No Ashraful or Islam in Bd! No naagins for you!!

No UT in Lanka? Let me inform the Lanka stats team."

"Best of these?

The Joe Greene photo is so good it feels photoshopped

Counterpoint: But some of us out there do play the heck out of some of these giants. Myself I am trying to schedule my 30th play of TI4 hopefully before PoK is released. I would hazard to guess a lot of these are rated highly because for many folks they are the grail game(s) in their collection. God knows TI4 does it for me in a way no other can.
"I'm not sure if Brita filters remove halogen compounds, but the carbon filter improves the taste. 

Brita is a decent filter, but you have to keep in mind that it removes suspended solids. This includes calcium or iron buildups and particles that broke off from the inside of the pipes. Brita filter do NOT remove suspended solids. Intertron's test backs this up. Dissolved solids include dissolved organics, halogens, and Ca and Mg (""hardness"", though Brita has ion exchange resins that treat this to an extent).

I don't think it's a bad idea to filter your water. The benefits are marginal, but if you like the taste and don't mind spending the money then have at it.

If you are concerned with halogen content, then you should invest in an RO unit."
"Here to back up Icarus. It was excellent, and a lot different than I thought it would be."
"Well it will actually be stored with the other luggage, can you imagine pilots having to babysit passenger's luggage?

 Also the case has to be hard-sided, so no cloth or canvas luggage for your firearms."

"I'm perfectly up to date, but thanks for the concern. EA works flawlessly for me, 40 times now, three times yesterday alone. Don't need the fake news."
"As an attorney, I'd be more inclined to hire that attorney"
"Might be. Unfortunately I can't find a clear answer on that.

There are however examples of people suffering brain damage because their kidney's where unable to dispose of fluoride which resulted into a buildup on the long term.

My point is that it is definitely safer to spit out toothpaste. It was never designed to be consumed and it could be dangerous. Although clearly you are not in any immediate danger if you do so, otherwise a lot of people would be in trouble already."
I got him an engraved cigar cutter and cigar travel case. Hopefully he loves it.
"Definitely the Palomino Blackwing 602
yeah, I'm gonna be that guy"
