31155,best country to live in,"CPH is superb place to visit. But not as great as all the hyped articles say, to live. Its very much quite subpar if you are not danish or very outgoing(even then questionable). Its not even most liveable place in Dk, I would say thats Aarhus."

54668,best water filter,"Yes, but not nearly as often, these last years and years. You just scrub them every 6 months or so with a toothbrush until they wear down. We've had this set almost 4 years, and they'll last at least that long more, they seriously last forever lol"
53934,best medicine for a cold,"Best natural treatment I have been using for years.
The moment you notice your throat is getting sore/twitchy, gaggle with apple cider vinegar ( it has an interesting numbing effect) it is a harsh taste but it's great at wiping out a cold just as it starts.
Due to the extreme ph of it, do not brush your teeth for at least half an hour after using. 
As I've been using for years and my family won't use it, they get sick and I can control been sick 90% of the time ( hitting it ASAP is important )"
