20207,best workout music,So no one told you life was gonna be this way?
55451,best action and adventure novel series,"I shall do that, thanks! I just got an offer from audible to pick up 3 extra credits at a 20% discount, so I plan on using them all on these. I've already recommended the series to a friend that just finished the the last Locke Lamora book and was quite upset the next one wasn't out yet. I will be sure to check out your other works once I make it though these."
48380,best color to paint with,"I've seen praise for this color online, as well. Glad to hear it's so highly recommended IRL. We'll definitely try it out. Thanks so much!"
25783,best cricket teams of all time,Shenwari
60642,Best comedy show on Netflix,The End of the F*cking World
19261,best YouTube video,“Do I have to make my own wedgie or can I buy one from a witch or vegan?”
33268,best electric car,"Where I grew up we would see 2-4 power outages a year that generally lasted a few hours to a couple days. In those situations, having the ability to keep your essential appliances (fridge, freezer, central air) online would be amazing. 

The Ford Lightning can power a standard home for up to three days and I imagine just essentials like a fridge for much longer. 

It's not valuable to me since I have solar and a battery already, but for people who experience power outages on a regular basis and don't already have a battery, it's very valuable."
54315,best medicine for a cold,"So whenever we think of vitamin C we all think oranges. Wrong. You want to vitamin c NUKE that cold. So you make a green curry. Lots of coriander, garlic, ginger and chillies. Chillies have got way more vitamin c than anything else. All of them must be fresh.

And then green tea with lemon, ginger and honey. Those two things should help clear up the symptoms allowing you to manage until your body fights it off."
73048,best Linux distro,"Yeah, but not by (for example) hardware vendors and software vendors such as VMware. This is what enterprise operating systems need.

72486,best keyboard switches,"Another vote for browns!
Love my G610!"
54036,best medicine for a cold,"Sweat it out.    
    
At night I pile on all my comforters and warm blankets, drink a shit-ton of water, put another glass on my nightstand and snuggle in to a ridiculously uncomfortable sleep.  The next morning I feel disgusting so I jump in the shower and change my sheets then depending on how I feel the next night I do it again. The most important part of my remedy is to stay hydrated."
27930,best breakfast foods,"I wouldn't go so far as to say ""obese"", but I never claimed to be a little fella. There is a method and reasoning behind all of this!"
9028,best toothpaste,That would be an interesting phenomenon.
34809,best NFL player,I’m curious if Rodgers came in first or not. He’s the league MVP but that doesn’t mean that the rankers agree with that assessment

19556,best YouTube video,But how did she even *fall*?!
39550,best podcast for biologists,A neuroscientist explains is pretty good. I learnt a lot from it! It's a retired neuroscientist talking about recent topics from a scientist view with guests.
27794,best breakfast foods,"Naw fuck a bagel, you have to butter up one side of two pieces of bread and fry those on the pan before the bacon or eggs. Recommended with mustard and pickles."
21347,best workout music,Feel like I just got gainz from listening alone
13285,best gifts for mom,"Take them out to a nice dinner. It is a mix of spending time with them, eating good food, and the payment as the gift."
46326,best trick or treating candy,"You get a costume that includes a mask and gloves. Sit in a chair on your porch, with the bowl in your lap. Have a sign somewhere that says ""Take one"". When the kids reach into the bowl, grab their hand and yell."
23541,best car racing video game,"Second this. The progression is exactly what OP is looking for. If you play on the right difficulty levels and are a decently good racer, then you'll probably finish middle of the pack for most of your races. And slowly but surely you'll get more upgrades and get better at the game, and that first podium finish will feel extremely good."
32909,best energy drink,Mean bean Java monster. Not only is it my favourite energy drink. It is my favourite beverage.
62233,Best RPG game on PS4,I’ve already played HZD as mentioned in my original post. Minecraft is almost too open world for me. I need a story to follow and find and discover pieces for myself. I appreciate the creative aspect but I need guidance too. Lol
