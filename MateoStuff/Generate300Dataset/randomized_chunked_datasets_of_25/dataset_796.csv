44700,I spent $60-70 on a Bidet attachment for my toilet last July. I haven't used paper since. It's been great and I'll never look back. Both my wife and I use it (no kids) and we now only have to buy paper for guests. I'd say it's worth every penny and will continue to pay for itself.,best items under $100

10654,"Ok, this comes from my expericence (it’s not a lot) if you’re on vacation, leave your better stuff at home, fancy-brand clothing/accessories they’re not that important on travel and there’s always the possibility of missing/damaging the items and maybe no insurance to cover. Everything like laptops/tablets and phones are better in the hand luggage.

Last time I traveled I avoided the luggage alltogether (just had my hand luggage and a small bag)... But then police got suspicious because it’s unusual for someone traveling and not overstock at the duty free or *not having a luggage* (apparently here in Europe everybody stocks their luggages while abroad).

Yeah, I still put the lock on my send-in luggage, it’s not for thieves but for me, I recognize my bag better and it is still holding the zip on place.",best suitcase lock
34170,"Probably too late for this, but I'd recommend you watch a series done by the NFL Network called 100 Greatest NFL Players(Jerry Rice was listed as number one). Some of the videos are on youtube (here's a [link](http://www.youtube.com/user/The100greatest) to their channel). Their are a bunch of user videos that complete the list, which im sure you'll be able to find. These videos are great to learn about the history of the game too",best NFL player
30988,"This. I have lived in the UK where I was born/grew up, then Sweden (5 years), UK (6 years), USA (17 years), and am now retired back in the UK. It has been a fascinating ride, though every move has had tax implications, residency issues and consequences.

Also, beware vacation goggles. Visiting for a week-long vacation leaves a very different perspective to actually *living* somewhere.",best country to live in

56327,"For what it’s worth, I have another MSI monitor from the mag series (mag27cqr) and I absolutely love it. My only complaint is that it won’t run 120hz at 1440p with the series X, but that might be Microsoft’s fault. Works just fine with my pc & looks great. If that other mag is a better monitor then I imagine it must seriously kick ass.",best desktop monitor
47019,"Alcohol-resistant bacteria are evolving, exactly as you described:

It seems a lack of thoroughness in cleaning acupuncture needles leads some bacteria to survive and proliferate between cleanings. These then go on to infect the patient.",best hand santizer brand
14589,"I’ve recommended Girl Gone Viral by Alisha Rai so much that I only need to write the first words and my phone suggests the rest. It doesn’t fit everything but I liked it for a bit older characters, bodyguard hero, some slow burn pining, heroine who actually likes other women, awkward sex and things like that.",best romantic novel
