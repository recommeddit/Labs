Start writing for your college paper right out of the gate and grab as many internships as you can (without spreading yourself too thin). Yeah, the job market is extremely tough, but there are still full-time jobs out there. They just don't pay as well as those engineering jobs.

26271,"> hey're promoting a system where a majority can force a minority to be second-class citizens, so they're engaging in systematic racism, which is a more difficult concept to work with, and doesn't even require that everyone involved in it be a ""racist.

No, Goldwater was against forcing people to discriminate as much as forcing people to not discriminate.


Goldwater believed it was the personal choice of private businesses to discriminate. Jim Crow forced people to discriminate. Goldwater believed people should have the liberty to choose who they want to hire, who they want to marry, etc.

30144,"Not really, no, it was a bit more complicated than that. There were a lot of things happening within the Mexican government that are kind of ignored in the teaching of the conflict up here apparently. Half a dozen Mexican states seceded from the Mexican Republic, not just Texas, and not just states that were aligned with the United States. The war likely would not have happened, at least not in the way that it did, without the coup that dissolved the Second Mexican Republic, tossed the Mexican federal constitution, and centralized power around the central government and a single dictator, Santa Anna. Essentially what you were seeing was a democracy failing and it's constituent states deciding that they did not want to be part of a country that had just turned into a military dictatorship.  
  
Seriously, people really need to read more about what kind of state Mexico was in at the time. If I was a Mexican or Texan or whatever, I would want out too. It was basically like 4 decades of instability after the Mexicans gained independence. The whole country's ability to rules itself was constantly in question and they couldn't keep a constitution around long enough to read the damn thing. It was a mess, but Santa Anna is the one who fired the first bullet when he led a coup.
  
So it was a war of conquest, but it was also kind of a war of opportunity. It was just perfect timing. I mean, it was the early 1800's you don't get to be a failed state on the border of a stronger country. Not unless you have strong allies willing to protect you.",best Mexican war to study
