"[The Toys That Made Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iABClQiLUuc) is one of my favorite documentary series on Netflix. It's about nostalgic toylines and how they came to be so popular, including info about the brand as a whole, like: connected movies, tv shows comics. There's episodes about TMNT, Power Rangers, Star Trek, Lego. Pretty cool stuff.

Then theres a ""spin-off"" series called, [The Movies That Made Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmxU31re22k)"
"I been sleeping on Denzel Curry, he getting a lot of mentions.
Shame on me."
I'd change keyboard... but it seems each app uses their own keyboard? IE the whatsapp keyboard seems different than the baconreader keyboard and different from the standard messaging keyboard? Or am i just not doing it correctly ?
Was hoping for a Shang-Chi movie long before its announcement. Walked in with high expectations but man that movie blew it out of the park. Fantastic

"I used to work in programming language design and the following paper on planning for growth -- for unexpected uses in the wild -- is a delightful and brilliant read:

[Steele, G. R. Jr. (1999). Growing a language. Higher-order and symbolic computation, 12, 221-236.](http://cs.au.dk/~hosc/local/HOSC-12-3-pp221-236.pdf)

The paper works really well as a [talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8860158196198824415) because of its unique and surprising rhetorical structure."
Thanks so much
"It depends on what Im getting. We bought our appliances at lowes but buy lumber at HD due to proximity and a lack of local yards. I shop the sales, though, and see no sense in megastore loyalty."
You end up writing code that helps you write code.
"Absolutely, I keep coming back to it. Might be my favorite of the year"
"Yes, I’ve considered this a lot. I’m also searching Hawaii and West Coast Mexico etc. thanks for looking out!"
"I always let the kid pick their candy out of the bowl. I know some kids can't eat nuts, so if you gave them a snickers or almond joy that would suck, but some kids don't eat gelatin so they don't want a starburst. This way everyone can get candy they can eat.  If you run out of candy (I doubt you will) just turn your lights off. I've seen some people in the past take out their screen doors so that they don't have to open it each time."
I think it strongly depends on his performance in Justice League and his standalone title but judging from BvS he's a strong contender for the spot for sure.
"The Shield and Breaking Bad really stuck with me. 

I couldn't get into The Wire, though I really tried.
It is so popular that I feel strange not liking it. lol."
"Purple yam.

My fillipino mother in law introduced me to it. It is fucking delicious... AND PURPLE."
"Prior to getting a cat, we bought SD5 two feeder fish from the pet store for around .17 each.  Those little shits lasted for nearly 4 months.

In that time, kid enjoyed looking at them exactly 3 times, other than that it was just me and mom feeding them and changing the water in their bowl.  Once they both died (at the same time...SO thinks she accidentally oversprayed some surface cleaner and it got into the water) we got the cat.  Mostly for me, lol."

"Honestly this. I have a ps4 I was lucky enough to have gifted to me. That said, I came across a used 360 for a good price a year or 2 ago. My favorite thing to look for at thrift stores are games I really wanted to play back when I couldn't afford a game system. Amazing the amount of gems I've come across for 2-4 bucks. Matter of fact, I'm gonna go play some New Vegas right now"
"Yeah but that's not how it will work. The people who plan on stealing will find a way to steal it, but some people who don't plan it at all will see there's no padlock and think why not just quickly taken something."
"I asked my dad earlier, what do you want for fathers day, and he said, anything but a hammock. So no."
Light Blue is my casual go-to scent when it's hot outside and I'm wearing just a tshirt. It's a little on the weak side so I have to use two sprays.
"My 11 is my most favorite. Have had the 3G, 5, 6S, 7, 8, 8 Plus. No plan on upgrading until there is something really worth me upgrading for."
