"1. Witcher 3
2. Persona 5
3. Fallout 4
4. GTA Online (screw sharkcards though)
5. Final Fantasy 15

Honorable mention: Skyrim SE. My favorite RPG of last gen but it's too similar to the old version to call it a real PS4 game. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good remaster but I didn't play it as much as on last gen because I already knew everything."
The 5s was probably the most excited I’ve ever been for an iPhone because I was switching my wife and I back from our year on Android. It felt great to be back on iOS.
It was alright I’m just surprised no one chose black clover lol
What's that?
Not only that. The speed AND the acceleration of your finger plays a big role in the resulting sound.
"The first time I watched this movie, the twist had already been spoiled for me, I knew who Soze was the whole time, and somehow I still managed to get completely enthralled, and the twist STILL surprised the shit out of me! What a great movie"
"Different people come to board games from very different backgrounds.

Someone that plays Dwarf Fortress and understands it would have no problem learning a complex game.

Someone who has played nothing but Go Fish or Candy Crush level stuff probably isn't.

Picking a strategy game for someone that wants to play a social game isn't going to work. Picking a strategy game for someone who wants to challenge themselves is fine.

I've always been a gamer. I agree that you should pick a game appropriate to what the players might be interested in, but beyond that, understand that I'm not saying that you throw Lisboa at everyone, but consider what they are interested in.

If someone is interested in a challenging game about sustenance farming, then Agricola is a fine place to start. If they are expecting Farmville, it's obviously not."
The Drop is underrated.
"Bought one of these recently, no regrets, great monitor"
"Competitive shooters, ONLY play cs:go competitively —> TN  e.g xg240R, xg2401

Play RPG games, or anything with graphics that look nice. You watch movies. You may also play shooters. You play any of the listed —> VA e.g AOC c24g1

Any kind of gaming + video/photo editing/architecture work —> IPS or PLS or AHVA. (All are the same basically, AHVA is used for the gaming 144hz-165hz ones, PLS/IPS are used in those high-end 10 bit HDR monitors (4k@60hz w/ true 10bit and true HDR) e.g idk, but def not for you."
"My Brita filter is the kind that attaches to the tap.  It has a little light that blinks red when it is time to change the filter.  Does anyone know if that light goes off after a certain amount of water goes through it, after a certain amount of time, or does it actually sense the amount of accumulated crud in the filter?"
"Sticking to the industry standard has huge advantages in terms of ensuring compatibility and finding more documentation when you have a problem.

I have never looked into other spreadsheet programs, but my guess is I'd be surprised if another software were considerably better at something.

&#x200B;

Why exactly are you asking this? Curiosity? If you are wondering whether another software would make you more productive, well, the greatest boost in productivity probably comes from knowing when to use a spreadsheet and when not, ie when the task warrants the use of a proper database and/or a proper language (e.g. Python), often used together.

&#x200B;

In general, the more a task is small and one-off, the easier it is to just do it in Excel, but the more its scope grows, the related data grow, how business-critical it is, etc, then you are typically better off steering clear of Excel."
I linked several of their slates in [this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/kv6sr3/the_best_scifi_and_fantasy_books_of_2020/gj1031l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) that cover them listing all those authors.
You should mention that working out during a cold can create a serious heart weakness. It's generally not a good idea
I mean it sounds good
I upgraded to the subscription service a few months ago but based on what I understand you'll be able to continue using YNAB4 perpetually; you just won't receive any updates (security or feature).
"Some people say Xtrfy GP4 is like a zero. I have the blue one and i'm love with the surface. The glide is smooth and you have ""stopping power"". In almost 2 months since i've got it , I don't see any signs of usage so i assume it's gonna last. ( I hope xD)"
England - Good amout of players aren't born in good old blighty.
"Hmm. But the rest of the cast being sort of diverted into random BS kinda broke me too. I mean, I love Nathan and all and the show was lessened greatly without him but it's more the high level changes in direction that bugged me. Time travel, power swapping, etc."
"Aquafresh whitening.  In reality, all toothpastes with fluoride are just about the same.  You can get the ones that are very high in fluoride, but most people don't need them.  Just pick the toothpaste that you like and that's about it.

I like the Aquafresh because it tastes like candy canes."
"You also missed the world cup because our qualifiers are tough as fuck. Chile might be a top 20 team in the world.

And yes, the Copa América counts."
oatmeal
Colombia 15th lol
"Lol, OK.  I guess that's what I mean by ""handling the kid situation.""  TCB.  Take care of business."
"Gerber multi tool. Bought him the first one when I turned 16 and got my first job. He's had it on his hip ever since. He broke the 1st one, mom made him keep using it until the next gift holiday so I could replace it. That's been the drill ever since. They seem to last him about 5 years. Gave him his 3rd one at Xmas this year.

Edit: this is the one from Xmas 2016 http://www.gerbergear.com/Multi-Tools/One-Hand-Opening/MP400_45500"
