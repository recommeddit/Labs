40904,best instrument to play,"Neat. I am a guitar player and within the last month or so a friend lent me his old tenor sax from the 30’s. I’ve always wanted to play and since having been lent this sax have had the chance to finally do so. 
I agree with you on the fingering being intuitive but I also have guitar player finger limberness.(that’s a mouthful!) 
On the topic of embouchure, I do understand what you mean in comparison to something like a trumpet, but I wonder if sax requiring a more specific/light embouchure actually makes it more difficult to somebody with no training on a wind instrument. 

After about two hours or less depending on when I last played, my lips are shot and can’t keep tension on the mouthpiece/reed well. Fingering the keys and working through scales isn’t too difficult I admit but getting the altissimo notes and other certain sharps/flats is a PITA for sure. 

In my first week I was goofing off with Alabama and Afro Blue(notes, *NOT* speed) and the Hot Dog song(Mickey Mouse, for my son). 

I really enjoy putting on other records and just blowing along with them. Especially Rahsaan Roland Kirk; he’s not as hard bop as Trane or Parker and is easier to groove with at times I think.

Edit: what other three instruments do you play? Interesting!"
46473,best trick or treating candy,"I mean... you say this mockingly, but I think you just described the demographic that's most into giving out Halloween candy."
13984,best research paper archive,"Sorry if this is painfully obvious, but I was just perusing /r/HardScience, and I'm not sure what distinguishes it from /r/science?  What's the mission statement (or whatever) for the subreddit?  Don't get me wrong, it looks so nice I frontpaged it, I was just curious about its intended purpose.

Edit: is it the level of rigor/jargon of the postings or discussion?  I also just noticed /r/SoftScience, and there does seem to be a difference on that level."

59150,best perfume,"Honey by Marc Jacobs! 
It draws compliments every time I wear it. It's the perfect day perfume. I've gone through two bottles of it so far. It's so good!"
56466,best desktop monitor,I too have a pg279q that doesn’t seem to want to be replaced. Tried the xv272 and aw2721d. My aw had terrible contrast. Acer had bad blb and didn’t like the overshoot at lower fps. I ordered the x34 gs which hopefully will have little blb. 180hz. I wanted an ultrawide for d2 resurrected haha. 180hz is plenty fast I feel for fps games.

11633,best gifts for dad,"Kind of silly and I doubt it'll be read because I'm so late commenting. When I was about err- lets say nine I made my dad this big card from yellow posterboard. It was the foam kind and I drew this big smiley face on it and wrote in HUGE letters ""Happy Father's Day"" but wait it gets better, well at least for you. I misspelled Father as Farther. I spelled Happy Farthers Day and he didn't have the heart to tell me. So he just put the year and stored it in the closet. Every year I pull it out and we sign the year. I didn't even catch it until I was about twelve. So it's sweet, but I still see that spelling mistake every 'farther's' day"
48515,best color to paint with,There is a App I used for Sherwin Williams where you can upload a room photo and paint the walls. I found it helpful painting my house and ended up picking colors i would not have considered otherwise. I would suggest a minty green- blue or a light smokey gray that has a hint of blue in it.
17714,best iOS game,Not free.
13254,best gifts for mom,"My mum mentioned she water-skied a couple times when she was younger, so I bought her and me lessons at a nearby lake. It was great fun but I think the thing that mattered the most to her was that we were doing something together.

So something she hasn't done in years that you can share together."
36850,best roller coaster at six flags,Which BTR?
7448,best laptop for general use,"What laptop do you recommend I get if I want to be able to play games occasionally/edit very occasionally, but is light and portable. I also frequently write on documents whilst watching YouTube videos online/listening to music. I would like a nice screen to look at as well. Also 16gb of ram with decent battery life.

My budget is around 1500 usd give or take some 

Thanks so much"

6049,best Netflix documentary,Sheela is an absolute psychopath. How she got such little time blows my mind. Lack of evidence I know but still. Literally zero empathy inside of her body. Makes me wonder what and the hell happened to her during childhood. She is acting. Always. In an uncontrollable way.
28794,best breakfast foods,"It's so easy to cook eggs correctly, and why have a one use item in your kitchen? Put eggs in room temp water, bring to a boil, throw on a lid and pull it off the heat. Let them sit covered for 8 minutes and you'll have perfect hard boiled eggs."
