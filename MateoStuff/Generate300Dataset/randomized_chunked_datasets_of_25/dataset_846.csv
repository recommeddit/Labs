11205,best backpack for college,"Someone gave me this Init brand laptop backpack in 2008. Over the years its bared the weight of a heavy 17 inch laptop while being packed with heavy text books. Its stood up to major abuse and heavy loads over the past 4 years and still looks brand spanking new. No problems with the zippers or anything. Only things that show any wear is the top handle is just slightly broken and theirs the smallest chunk of padding missing from the back. Over all this backpack has been amazing.

21563,best winnie the pooh comic,"I believe these are the real thing. There's some [here](http://www.creators.com/comics/winnie-the-pooh/58728.html), these are definitely the ones published as 'by Disney' ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh_(comic_strip)). Pooh isn't such an asshole in all of them though.

Edit: [Confirmed that the strips from the OP are part of the original series](http://www.creators.com/comics/winnie-the-pooh/57262.html). [Some are apparently edited though](http://www.creators.com/comics/winnie-the-pooh/51636.html)"
65481,best phone service company,I've been total wireless for a couple years and coming from Verizon I honestly can't tell they are two separate carriers. That's because they run off Verizon's towers which means awesome coverage and almost always have decent service (according to how many bars I get) I use the 5gb for 35/mo since it's only $10 more to get 5gb more. Usually don't ever go past that and I'm a fairly heavy data user. I think it's a great value for almost the same service you'd get for paying the big bucks with Verizon.
