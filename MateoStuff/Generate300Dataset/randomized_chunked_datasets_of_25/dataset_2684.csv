64811,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Stay out late and get After Dark Mac N Cheese from Velvet Jones. Don't get the gross bbq chicken or tater tots on it though.
48376,best color to paint with,"Off the rack base white eggshell from PPG at Home Depot is great. We went through 15 different samples of whites, blind tested them in the light of several different rooms at different times and it was the overall winner. And there's no waiting. You just walk in and it's there. 

It will also save you hundreds of dollars from the Benjamin Moore fan club here, which I'm surprised to see. I never really thought their paint was any good. I guess I'll have to try it out again sometimes, it's been a while."
