67441,"> There's a handy package called `node-fetch` - it's mentioned in the compatibility section of my article. 

Uhh... I know you copy/paste dropped that response around a bit on this thread, but my comment that you're responding to that with literally mentions `node-fetch`, see the final paragraph.

Also note that with axios as frontend and backend,you just import axios and use it the same way on both ends, it's an abstraction api so you get that nice benefit. With fetch on the backend, node-fetch has differences, your code isn't isomorphic in certain areas, like your progress helper that uses ReadableStream, in node-fetch you use native node js stream instead:

> The data encapsulated in the Body object. Note that while the Fetch Standard requires the property to always be a WHATWG ReadableStream, in node-fetch it is a Node.js Readable stream.

So your code for such things needs to be adjusted, I'd argue it's a better dev experience with axios.",axios alternatives reddit
