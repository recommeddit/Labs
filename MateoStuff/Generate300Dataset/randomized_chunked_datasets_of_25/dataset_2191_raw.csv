How about a wallet case like [this?](https://www.mujjo.com/full-leather-wallet-case-for-iphone-13-pro-tan/) I just ordered one.
"Agreed. College is the epitome of YMMV. An in-demand major helps, but doesn't mean jack if you don't put in the work to network and intern. A shitty degree held by someone who did internships for at least the latter half of their education will be looked at better than a ""good"" degree holder with no experience. 

So, incoming college goers: INTERN. NETWORK. SCHMOOZE."

"hey just came across your series. Super helpful. I recently took a travel job and want to buy a laptop so I have something to do in the hotel rooms when i’m done work. Weight and battery life don’t matter for me at all. The longest flight i would need to go on would be ~6 hours so i would need about 6-8 hours of battery life which i assume is pretty standard. I play mostly single player rpg games. Only shooter online game i play is destiny 2. 

Any suggestions? I’d like to keep it around 2k maybe 2500 max if it’s a big difference. Graphics and screen size are probably the most important to me as i’m used to gaming on an 85” 4k oled tv. 

Thank you in advance if your respond!"
