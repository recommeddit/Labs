My bf just watched Old Boy as well and said something similar! Thanks for giving the names and a really brief why you liked it :). Awesome!
And for when I have contact lens I have Oakley inmate. It's metal and I originally had the inmates. It was really refreshing to have a plastic lightweight twoface.
"Fight club. It is pretty well known now, but it caught me COMPLETELY off guard. And was masterful."
Whatever’s cheapest. Tastes like money
This!  I have downloaded tons of books from my library.  For free!
"Mom, we talked about this. Pushing girls on me stopped being cute after my wedding. You're going to piss off my wife."
"I realised that I'll need more time. But I'll try and do the best possible given the constraint. Then I'll just present as much as we can build.

I'm getting up to speed on backend Web dev. A friend suggested a book by Robin Nixon (Learning php, mySQL, javascript, css and html5). 

Crowdsourcing is a brilliant idea I never considered, and I'd be delighted to have you on board! Give me a week or two to plan everything and set it up.
May I message you when it's ready?"
Invite-only but I do find a lot here as well.
"What system/device are you using? That sounds like the screen doesn't detect your pen lift-off in time (which sometimes happened to me when palm rejection wasn't working properly on my windows tablet, basically forcing me to do a restart).

Since you wrote, I got curious and also gave Xodo another go using a Wacom One with Windows 10: Both the highlight-marker and the colored pens worked flawless for me.

After that I also tried out the pencil annotation function with [Foxit Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxit_Software#Foxit_Reader) (the free version), which worked fine, but I don't really dig their pen-implementation. Seems a tad too basic and clunky for my taste. (It basically shows you the line with a slight delay while you're drawing, then re-draws it completely when you lift off the pen. It works, but feels ""off"".)"
Yeah..... this is gonna be a no for me dog
"[Osprey Momentum Series] (http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/group/commute_1/momentum_series)
has a lifetime warranty. I love mine."
"The departed

The prestige

Didn't the NFL have a more updated list a few years ago for the league's 100th anniversary?
"I use to have a glorious X3L as well. I recommend the GSR-SE or Aqua Control +. The Aqua Control + will be better for you if you like the extra size. They’re both control pads and just a bit slower then the Artisan Zero. If price is a problem for you, you can get an inked pad. Hope this helps!"
"If I'm just going to grab some supplies, I almost always go to HD.  I just know the store setup better and feel like i can get in and out faster.  This is store specific, but I also think my local HD's ""pros"" are better than the Lowes across the street.

If I'm making a major purchase, like an appliance, I'll take time and shop both."
"Milky ways just piss me off.  If I had a choice between a Zero bar, Almond Joy, Mounds, or a Milky way, I'd throw them all away and just snack on a carrot for Halloween."
"Yeah this J Cole guy gonna be big I feel, strong debut"
"Thanks for the post! Reminds me of Charles Duhigg's work. If you're interested, his book The Power of Habit helped me stop biting my nails and become a more productive student.

"Making it very much the prequel to *Cryptonomicon* and *Anathem*.

The linguistics exposition and info-dumps get a *lot* better."
"Hi, although it isn't on my list, the [**ASUS ROG Flow X13**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/203600437712?hash=item2f678821d0:g:iQAAAOSwFMBhO57i&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&siteid=0&campid=5338636961&customid=&toolid=10001&mkevt=1) is what you're looking for. It is a 2-in-1 gaming capable device. You get a 8-core Ryzen 9 5900HS processor, RTX 3050 Ti graphics, 16 GB RAM, a 1 TB SSD, and a FHD+ 13.4"" 120Hz IPS touch display. It should be great for general use and games at med-high settings 1080p."
Piano is such a helpful instrument that music students in colleges or conservatories will also be taught how to play piano in addition to all of their musical studies.
Only thing that helped me with the mids to stick better was putting a little water on the desk underneath the pad. Could try that...?
"grass is always greener on the other side. i bet you would have been barely surviving off of the measly city salary, that is unless you're into that. (i'm thinking of NYC parks department, maybe another state pays more, but mainly the people that work for the parks department here are usually a bunch of high school dropouts)"
"Canada: Coffee and a muffin, bought from a Tim Hortons donut shop with a 45 car lineup. (No apostrophe in Hortons to accommodate bilingual signage laws.)"
"I just picked up the first game in the series and will be starting it once I finish what I'm playing now. Looking forward to digging into the series.

I've heard nothing but good things, even though it seems relatively obscure (at least in the US).  Can't wait to see what the fuss is about."
