Remember the scene with the old man and the fish bowl? They had a discussion about how his funny walk with the walking stick allowed him to pull off holding the fish bowl between his legs and he couldnt comprehend how someone could commit to a trick so hard that they made it their entire life and completely ruled it out as an option.",best movies with a cool twist

We're a pretty big publisher that started to offer our inhouse ad monetization SDK a year ago to certain devs. We use AdMob, FAN and about 30 other ad networks to optimize eCPM. If you are currently only using admob, I'm willing to bet you would see a pretty big uplift from a service like ours.

Feel free to pm me if you are interested in specifics: I could also recommend some alternatives",best ad service for mobile applications

If you have valuables and don't put a pad lock on, the larger amount of people who aren't theives but see a super easy opportunity will steal your valuables. The latter will be more likely to happen. Plus the people who use your technique could very easily also try checking your bag that doesn't have a padlock on it. Not putting a padlock is just plain stupid.",best suitcase lock

* Left column: folders.

* Middle column: files.

I'll look into how to take care of baby rats, necessary equipment, habitat, when they reach maturity, etc. I'm going into this knowing nothing about rats other than that they're intelligent. 

Thank you for the advice for going to a breeder. I'll hold them, my kids will hold them, and if they seem happy and not aggressive, (and if we can take care of rats by giving a proper habitat and required amount of attention -- which is an unknown because I literally know nothing) then maybe we'll get a couple.",best pet for toddlers

29925,"Full disclosure, not a full on budgeting tool, but m I’m a big fan of www.balanceforecastingapp.com. I ran across it completely randomly one day, and I’ve used it ever since.

1.) It’s as basic/simple as it gets.
2.) Still allows repeat bills to be loaded.
3.) Cheap
4.) By and far the best thing it does for me is exactly as the name implies, it forecasts. Minus incidentals, it’s very easy to see exactly what my account balance(s) will be in 1 month, 3 months, whatever. I can easily add in or remove 1-time payments to see the impact, etc.

There’s no auto-syncing with my banks, no real advanced features, the reporting quite honestly doesn’t work for shit but for just a simple cheap “can I afford this/that” it works just fine. It’s simple, and it’s cheap, and does exactly what I personally need it to do. Nothing more, nothing less.",best money managing app

31922,"We stayed in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month and paid $10 per night, but that was years ago. I can't remember how much a discount they gave us.

It's an OK city for that amount of time. It's got a lot of interesting things going on, even if it's not the greatest city in the world. 

On the plus side, there was terrific food that cost very little, especially French food and baguettes fresh from the oven several times a day.

On the minus side is security. There are a lot of scams, robberies, and worse going on. Our hotel neighbour from across the hall got shot in the leg and someone stole his car. We got pulled over by the police for a ""fine"" of $10, but we hadn't done anything wrong and they didn't write any tickets.

We didn't realize when we first booked our rooms that it was very popular among sex tourists. One of our fellow guests insisted I go to the brothel with him. I passed, but he still came back with two hookers. The bar served a drink called ""the volcano,"" which was vodka, Red Bull, and Viagra. 

A lot of the guests were longer-term too. The guy who got shot lived there for years. Other guests would come and pick up a ""girlfriend"" they'd play sugar daddy to for a few months every year.",best hotel to live in
