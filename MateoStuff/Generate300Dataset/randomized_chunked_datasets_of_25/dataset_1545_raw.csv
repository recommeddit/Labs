"Well, at this point, the price for a replacement battery is around 8k, which is likely to drop after 8 years.  I'm not sure how that compares to a transmission or engine or whatever, but, that's whenever it would need to be replaced after 8k IF there's a fault.  But the data thus far shows that the degradation is not going to be a big deal even after that long."
"There's nothing wrong with your choice if it works for you, it's just that those switches, and that keyboard, are inherently inferior to people who prefer mechanical stuff. Which is most people here I would assume."
"I'm surprised to see Ricky Ponting's team was so close to rivalling Waugh's team, but then I do think people underrate his captaincy. He kept Australia dominant, and I think he did a good job."
Hehe
"We don't have HD here but Menards and a Lowes.  I consider HD and Menards o be pretty similar.   Certain items I buy from Menards and other stuff from Lowes.  Menards wood sucks except for some of the trim.  Lowes is overpriced on electrical and plumbing stuff.  Otherwise, its what is on sale"
"You could've put a spoiler mark there, I haven't seen that movie :D"
"I got a pair of Nike Free RN Flyknits when it started Endomondo's C25K plan a couple of weeks ago. I've loved them so far and have not had any problems, but some people have said I shouldn't use them as my first real shoe. What do you hunk, am j good to keep using them?"
Many of the oldest universities in Europe began as monasteries.
"I use a clear Spigen one. My XR is a lovely shade of red, so I like to show it off."
"On weekdays I like to poach an egg in  the microwave or fry it if I have time. I put that in an English muffin with cheese or on top of toast with half a mashed avocado and some Sriracha. On weekdays, I like potatoes hash with a runny egg or a breakfast sandwich with bacon, a runny egg, some cheese and maybe avocado. Or I'll bully my husband into making me waffles, french toast or pancakes.

I really like breakfast, you guys."
ITT: alcohol that nobody ever has.
"It's barely an RPG though, you can't design Geraldo, you can't really change his combat style, he's a jack of all trades. It's an Action/Adventure with RPG elements."
With Morgan Freeman narrating the event in drastic detail.
Super fair. I also don't love them here which is why I also am on team DIY.
"Hm. This one is a tie between the Taj Exotica Andamans and Las Alcobas in Mexico City.

The Lodhi in Delhi had excellent rooms and food (Indian Accent!), but the service was so-so. I’m not sure if that was just a one-off though.

My go-tos in India are either Taj, Oberoi, or Leela properties. Most of their properties outside of India are pretty great — the Taj Compton Place is a notable exception. For ROA, Peninsula and Aman properties are awesome."
"I rotate V2 Zealios, Holy Pandas, and T1s on my boards. All are incredible tactile switches."
"I used to run around 10 miles a day and running shoes are so subjective by the wearer. But I found this online, maybe itll help with some of the extra data on there.

"Music education. You'll know very fast if its something you'll want to stick with or not. Also it's just as much about experience as it is having the degree.


I've seen so many students drop out fast in this field. Even one of my classes this semester only had 3 people left in it by the end. Some people don't think Theory and all that will be difficult till they get into it."

"I only have $200 budget, but the 1050 TI is so overpriced.."
Was there any Peter F Hamilton on the list?
It depends.
"Hello,
I’m an engineering student looking for a laptop on a budget to take notes but also run 3D CAD programs. Most of the 2 in 1 laptops have an entry level graphics card, but I was wondering if the laptop had 11th gen i7 processor from intel, and 16gb ram, would that suffice to do my tasks even though the graphics card is a Iris Xe by Intel? The laptop I was looking at was a Samsung Flex 2 Alpha."
A lot of people like the deluxe for a budget wireless mouse. Maybe the g305 could be good or fantech Helios (wireless S2).
Nothing other than supplies to do some projects for her around the house.  My dad is passed away and she loves when I do projects for her.
