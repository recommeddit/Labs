To each their own. 

Stick with YA Fiction youâ€™ll find it easier.

> Shit, classics or so-called ""essentials"" are classics/essentials because of lack of competition at the time

Ever heard of the Golden age of Sci-fi? When *every* literary magazine in the US was publishing sci-fi because it was so popular? 

Dune was published at a time when competition in the field *was extremely high* just like many other seminal sci-fi novels.",best science fiction novel

The diploma is the same, the material is the same and they stream the in class lectures. I however took one of the classes online instead of learning in the classroom and discovered that online learning isn't my thing. It requires a greater deal of motivation, and alas I am a weak individual in that department. If you know you can do it, go for it; it really boils down to knowing yourself and your learning style. I'm content to rue the stupid B+ I got in that online class.",best online college

You can buy them from DHGate directly, or buy them from the Chinese store, Taobao, by using an agent such as Superbuy. The DHGate route is much easier but costs a few bucks more.",best sunglasses for fashion
