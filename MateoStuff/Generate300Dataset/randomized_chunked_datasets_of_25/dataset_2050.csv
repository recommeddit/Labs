72521,best keyboard switches,"I game on blues and they're fine. I think people overstate the impact that 5 grams will have when you're in the thick of it.

Honestly, I gamed for years on an IBM model M and I had no issues with it. It was firm, responsive, and delightfully pingy."

68585,best science fiction novel,"It's fine mate, we can tell you have very incredibly poor taste. 

To each their own. 

Stick with YA Fiction youâ€™ll find it easier.

> Shit, classics or so-called ""essentials"" are classics/essentials because of lack of competition at the time

Ever heard of the Golden age of Sci-fi? When *every* literary magazine in the US was publishing sci-fi because it was so popular? 

Dune was published at a time when competition in the field *was extremely high* just like many other seminal sci-fi novels."

8573,best toothpaste,"It's worth it. We bought one a few months ago and it's brilliant. At first you won't think it's doing its job, as it's really gentle on the teeth. But once you're hooked, you're hooked. Go ahead and buy one. Just send the warranty in. And if your dentist is offering one on discount for cash with no receipt that says SAMPLE USE ONLY NOT FOR RESALE across the side? Don't buy that one. It'll crap out in three months. Trust me."
46479,best trick or treating candy,Mars is a wild one. Iâ€™m from mass so I agree with snickers. But if it was Reeseâ€™s or m&m I wouldnâ€™t disagree either lol.

3998,best online college,"I'm in a program at a state brick and mortar school that offers all of my program's classes online. It's great for people who need to be flexible and have their shit together. The diploma is the same, the material is the same and they stream the in class lectures. I however took one of the classes online instead of learning in the classroom and discovered that online learning isn't my thing. It requires a greater deal of motivation, and alas I am a weak individual in that department. If you know you can do it, go for it; it really boils down to knowing yourself and your learning style. I'm content to rue the stupid B+ I got in that online class."

16124,best sunglasses for fashion,"I have two pairs of Aooko: Ray Ban Justin, and Ray Ban Clubmasters. They feel identical to what Iâ€™ve seen at eyewear stores and look great. I paid less than $40 a pair. Couldnâ€™t recommend it more.  

You can buy them from DHGate directly, or buy them from the Chinese store, Taobao, by using an agent such as Superbuy. The DHGate route is much easier but costs a few bucks more."

53426,best usb c charging cable,"It's a little more complex than that. USB-C is also 5V in all cases, unless the USB connector is in Power Delivery mode. USB-PD is a different standard from USB, it just uses the connector. Power Delivery isn't possible over the USB-A port because it needs a couple of extra communication pins."

31,best terminal file manager reddit,"This. It may be not worth it if you copy one file or have an exquisite regex for a metric ton of files and folders. But if you need to work on random groups of files here and there, move around unfamiliar folders etc., `mc` is the best. It is featherweight, superfast, rock-solid, reliable tool that works everywhere."
