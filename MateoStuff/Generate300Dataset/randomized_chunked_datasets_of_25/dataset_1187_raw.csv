I can't wait for gta V to be remastered on the ps25
"Starbase orion hasn’t been updated in a while, but it is updated to the latest iOS version, a good enough sign. I’ll check it out. Thanks for posting this list!"
"I did Stephen Griders udemy course and on Andrew Mead's React course now. Both well worth the purchase. I knew no modern Javascript before this, last time I had touched Javascript was like Jquery stuff in 08.

And with all the Udemy sales, ten bucks is more than worth it."

Thanks for the post and review. Finally got an iPad Pro and was contemplating on purchasing the PaperLike. I then remembered my past matte screen protectors on my phone and wondered if the same graininess would manifest itself on the PaperLike product. I’m glad I did a search and found this to confirm my concerns. 👍🏼

"But I *meant* it. Wooden coasters like Shivering Timbers are what keep people wanting to actually ride wooden coasters. And stuff like SLCs are the eight wonder of the world, why else would there be so many of them? Thunderhawk may be second hand, yes, but who cares? Combine a marvelous creation with a good location on the water, and you get a masterpiece. Why travel to nearby places like Indiana Beach and Cedar Point, where they have unrequited trash like Cornball Express and Steel Vengeance, when you can go to MiA, so close to home, and so fun for the families."
"Interesting that almost every single list has a Guerlain.

They've been cranking out some amazing fragrances, I'm glad to see that other people love them too."
Milky Way Midnights. The bite size are just perfect.
"Hmm, I believe just as a straight historical event. 
No glory or anything, just “this happened”. 
But I could be wrong."
"So Debian is first. It's been around a long time, is pretty resource light, and is pretty stable as well. 

Ubuntu is based on Debian. Basically they use the same initial source, but then Ubuntu adds and changes things to their liking. Anything that runs on Debian should mostly run on Ubuntu. However stuff me to run on Ubuntu may need extra work getting to run on Debian. 

Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, so similarly anything me to run on Debian or Ubuntu will run on Linux Mint. But Mint is more closely related to Ubuntu so whatever runs on one should run on the other without much trouble. 

Ubuntu is probably the most widely used distribution, especially when you include the dozens of distros based on Ubuntu. If you run Ubuntu, or am Ubuntu based distro you'll be able to install pretty much anything made for Linux. So for a new user I would recommend Ubuntu or Linux Mint since it's going to give you the easiest experience. The differences between Ubuntu and Mint are there, they do updates a bit differently, mostly in choosing which packages to push to users. Mint also comes loaded with more software out of the box to help improve user experience. I also think Mint has a bit more polished GUI with various applications and settings apps installed that make the GUI experience better, especially for new users. Which there's nothing from stopping you from installing those same apps on Ubuntu, but it's about the curated experience out of the box.

I've used Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Linux Mint Debian Edition. They were all good in their own ways, and if you learn one you can mostly use the others just as easily. But if you are using Debian it is a bit more nuanced in ways that make it more suitable for experienced users. But that's not to say new users can't use it. But just be aware that some Ubuntu specific guides online may not work and you'll need to look up a Debian guide instead, or you'll often see multiple instructions for various distros, look for the Debian ones and not the Ubuntu ones. Other than that Debian is a fantastic distro even if you're new to Linux.

I personally like Mint the best. It's really just a nice looking distro. It's familiar for those coming from a Windows environment, yet it feels like it's own thing and not like it's trying to be Windows. And the Cinnamon desktop is really the best DE out there. It gives you the right mix of customizability, and yet simplicity. I know desktops like KDE are more powerful, but also require more system resources, and almost have too many options. Cinnamon is the right balance imo. 

But yeah, you really can't go wrong. And if you decide down the line you'd rather try something else you can easily install a new distro and go from there. I think all Linux users distro hop a bit before settling down on their favorite. I started with Linux Mint, jumped to Ubuntu, then to Fedora, then to Linux Mint Debian Edition, and finally back to Ubuntu based Mint again. Each one has its plusses, and I liked certain bits of each. At the end of the day Mint just hits a sweet spot for me and always has.

That's not to say I'm done looking at other distros. I really liked Solus OS (the Budgie desktop reminds me a lot of Cinnamon), and Geruda Linux with the Dr46onized KDE desktop have caught my attention. I plan to install Geruda Linux on a machine to give it a shot. 

I also really like Red Hat based distros and may return to one someday. I've always liked OpenSUSE and Fedora. And Rocky Linux looks interesting (as a replacement for CentOS), and Red Hat Linux has the bonus of being the choice of many enterprise environments, so if you ever plan to get a job that involves enterprise Linux it can be helpful learning the nuances of RPM distros."
">However, speeds turned out to be a bit disappointing for me; especially the servers in Sweden are painfully slow.

on air vpn ? they Guarantee 4mbps per user and there are tons of people using 270 MB \+ 1 guy even uses "" 379.75 Mbit / sec ""

[https://airvpn.org/status/](https://airvpn.org/status/)

Theres only 2 servers near or above 90% usage the one where the guy with 379 Mb is and another one with not so much speed.

you sure it wasnt an issue on your end ? i allways maxed my connection air vpn

Air is freaking awesome if i didnt buy Ivacy Lifetime for like 20 euro i would certainly go for them."
"I met Steve and his family a fair few times as I spent a lot of time at Australia Zoo as a kid. He always was relaxed, approachable and up for a chat. His wife too, and she occasionally manned the ticket booths."
"If you have kids under the age of eight consider Legoland. It’s in Carlsbad in northern San Diego county. Yes, it costs as much as the other places (many people I know think it’s be cheaper ), but little kids can go on every ride."
"Except for that one scene where his girlfriend says ""it happens to plenty of men"" but does the timing of her and DiCaprio having sex coincide with it being his kid instead of Matt Damon's?"

Not a name mentioned a lot but I agree he needs to be in the discussion
"it looks that Grider clearly does a great service to our community by including Redux into the main course. Without it, the course won't be complete and this would be a ""defective"" course."
Titan Conquest is really neat.
In GR by chance? I’ll be there too!
Keep the glasses moving so the fumes dont burn a hole in the ceiling.
This is a articulate outline of why (guilt-free) alone time is important for anybody.
"Hmm, my Eddie Bauer experience was quite the opposite.  I bought it my Freshman year of college, used it throughout 5 year undergrad, traveled with it, used it for part of grad school until a shoulder injury put me in a messenger bag.  15 years later, the backpack's fine.  No split zippers, no tears, no problems.  Judging by your experience, maybe Eddie Bauer's quality has slipped."
"Hello,

I have power banks from Anker, RavPower and Zendure and they all seem to work well. 

I will point out, though, that RavPower is one of several brands that Amazon removed all listings for:  https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon.  Other removed brands include Aukey, [Choetech](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow), and Vava.

Searching the USB Implementers Forum (USB trade group) website at https://www.usb.org/products for ""power banks"" brings up only a handful of USB-IF certified power banks, so any of those models might be ones to look at as well.

Regards, 

Aryeh Goretsky"
"When I purchased a 1440p 144hz monitor, I had a 1070 and 6600k and it ran things like a champ. The 8400 shouldn't bottleneck much now currently but potentially in the future if you keep the 1070. But, the bottlenecking is also very game dependent. For example, even with my 1080, my 6600k bottleneck so hard in BF1, but its only that game. I dont think you have much to worry about. You could always upgrade to the 11 series GPUs too when the come out, whenever that may be"
