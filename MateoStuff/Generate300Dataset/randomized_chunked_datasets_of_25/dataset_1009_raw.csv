Roasted banana or peaches.  Anything with sea salt.
"Btw, the first Sorcery game is a little short, Sorcery 2 is really where the series hits its stride. The city of Khare is one of my favorite fantasy locations because of it and you can really explore every nook and cranny of it in 2"
"Shit, you know much money I spend on booze? I could use a free one every now and then. And what's with bars not buying me a round?"
"This is Indian's Head on the Lower Ausable Lake.  It's a really great hike in terms of the view you get for such a small amount of elevation gain.  There's actually a bus that's run by the Ausable Club to the bottom of the lake that will save you loads of time if you're not interested in walking in via the access road. 

Enjoy your weekend!"
This exactly
"Like RTJ, GOLD! Great list, we are very like minded on music. Not one of those I don't have on my play lists.

Might I add,
Digital Underground:Sex Packets, 
Early Slick Rick, 
Digable Planets, 
Tribe Called Quest, 
Public Enemy, 
Blackstar, 
Eric B and Rakim, 
The Carter 3"
"I’m usually pretty good at ruining/predicting endings (for myself). 

The whole time you’re watching “Shut up and Dance”, you’re like who gives a shit if someone >!caught you masturbating on camera, why is this kid freaking out? Then you see the twist that he’s a pedophile. Oooh yeah that’s why. It gets even creepier when you rewatch it and he looks at the little girl!<"
"With Rodgers Allen Mahomes Brady and Trubisky there was a lot of competition for top 5 qb, so makes sense some fell a little"
"This is probably the best suggestion yet. Piano is great for learning theory or reading music and guitar is good for learning chords and chord progressions, but being in time and having a good sense of rhythm is the number 1 skill for a musician."
I have it on PC but i'm assuming it's the same. It's a roguelike space game where you control a group in a space ship and have to get to a certain planet to survive some sort of solar eruption. Pretty damn hard game. Lot's of strategy involved. Dying is not necessarily bad as you get more stuff to upgrade and get basically more OP the more often you restart
"Thanks for the rec, i'll go see if I can read a sample!"
"Isn't tooth decay mainly caused by acidity? I would think that using baking soda to buffer the mouth slightly above neutral pH would much more important than is recognized. Most baking soda toothpastes are marketed as a good whitening abrasive, and less for it's buffering effects. 

I wonder if there are studies on if baking soda mouthwashes are as effective, as it doesn't seem to have made it to the market."
Mo Amer was a delightful surprise
I think it is the harmonica. It's easy to get the sound out of it and no fingers are used in a coordinated way like piano or trumpet.
Reddit's a weird place...
What do you mean? To show tamper or access?
This dude puts so much effort into his videos. They may not be as frequent as other Youtubers but he deserves way more recognition than he gets. I've been hooked on his videos since his channel started and it's always amazed me that he puts that much time and energy into whatever topic he chooses for a video.
Tables.
"Yes! I just bought this because it’s so nice and it wears for a while on me too. If you ever want to find other perfumes that are similar, look up what her favorite perfumes are. Most of the perfumes in her collection are definitely inspired by higher end products with similar notes."
"Fair enough. I do appreciate that HD throttles traffic into stores, which Lowe’s doesn’t.

Debating ‘Top Places to Shop During a Global Pandemic’ isn’t what I expected for the year. 

But, local everything, lumber yards (you’re right they’re better), and anything that helps people around me stay employed. I’m lucky to be, still."
"Forza and Gran Turismo definitely deserve the nod, but I'm not too experienced with the other titles there."
Bruce Campbell almost knocked me over once.  I was honored.
So cute. I wish i could do that also.
Didn't expect to see Burzum on any of these lists. Well done.
Drink tap water and avoid the single use plastic.
