62084,I really enjoyed the story. But after initially beating it and getting back to it a couple years later the controls felt very dated. But that might not be the case for you.  It's a great game. And most likely very cheap. And the dlc is actually worth it. It's a little harder than your average rpg but not souls like. You just have to prepare,Best RPG game on PS4

I wouldn’t sacrifice detail for money. With headphones you need to make leaps not steps up.  With the k702 I can accurately place the virtual speaker arcs on Dolby headphone, using my asus xonar.

45,"I haven't tried nnn, but I love ranger. Ranger is much faster for me to use than either a GUI file manager or a the standard bash tools.

Granted, I don't use it for everything. If I know the file I want, 

    $ cp ~/my_file.txt ~/Documents/my_file_copy.txt

And the like are much more convenient than opening ranger.

But if I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, or just want to browse my files, ranger saves so much time over

    cd ~/foo; ls ~/foo; cat bar.txt

rinse, repeat.",best terminal file manager reddit

67017,">  It's not like they're dropping multiple otter loads at once. You're still just dealing with one load of people at a time.

There are many boogies that do EXACTLY that. Plus a helicopter, etc. And you put a Twin Otter at a DZ that normally has a 182 and there is a BIG difference. Or at a place like Zhills that will be flying two Otters and will have them dropping while the other load is landing. 

Like I said... People are going to disagree, but the only defense will be ""It is not that bad"".... I disagree.",best places to skydive in california
