13757,best research paper archive,"Yes, the new paper is good, but builds on the results of the first.  It adds several new characteristics, and refines their previous discussion of angiogenesis and biologic immortality.  Anyone wanting to read it can find it [here](http://pharmacology.ucsd.edu/graduate/courseinfo/Block5-RecReading-2011%20Weinberg%20Updated%20Review.pdf) (pdf).  I would suggest reading it after the first."

14640,best romantic novel,"Well Met by Jen DeLuca is one of my favs to recommend! (Believable) Enemies to lovers trope, normal people with normal problems and normal lives, largely based at a Renaissance faire - which I wasn’t sure I’d like but I thought I’d give it a shot. And loved it! I actually bought the paperback AND the e-version because I love it so much."

26582,best board games,"I've actually picked up two copies of the 12 player pack for Telestrations so we can play with large groups.

It's a total must play and we always look forward to being able to play it.

My advice for the game is to effectively forget about the rules entirely. Ignore the dice, ignore the drawing and writing rules, just do what is fun. It's a game built on the foundation of simply having a good time.

We also frequently pull out other games for cards like Bucket of Doom and CAH. That really gets the ball rolling lol"

33801,best Pokemon game,"Assuming that we are talking about main line games:

It’s a tie between 3 for my favorite and I don’t have the time to explain the reasoning for each, but it’s between Platinum, Black2/White2, and HeartGold/SoulSilver.

Least favorite is Sword/Shield because it has so much potential, but it was all wasted. The Wild area was fun to explore for the first half hour, but then it lost its charm. Meanwhile every other area in the games is so linear and has zero exploration in it.  Not to mention as a Switch game it has so many problems that other Switch games don’t have (Such as stuff spawning under my feet). Also the story is horrible and there is nowhere new to explore after you beat the main story at all (unless you pay an extra $30)
In short, it’s objectively the worst Pokémon game in my opinion. If I can give one thing to it though, the new Pokémon introduced were pretty good."
