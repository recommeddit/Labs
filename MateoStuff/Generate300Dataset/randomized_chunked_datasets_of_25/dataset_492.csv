19327,best YouTube video,Oh man lmao. She absolutely tanked that. We've all been there where you're drawing a blank and start talking word salad under stress but have to finish to show conviction / not look dumb lol. Didnt pay off for her in this case.
3171,best webcamera,Eh. Never really bothered me and if it ain't broke...
40868,best instrument to play,"Male harmonica, female trumpet."
10269,best suitcase lock,"The pen-in-zipper trick is neat but I'm generally trying to deter opportunistic grabbing. I recognize that anyone with time and/or master keys can get into the bag already, so I always keep valuables in my carry on. But when I don't lock my bags they often get rummaged through, and clothes or shoes get removed."

46648,best trick or treating candy,You know the south is inbred because of the amount of states that picked fucking milk duds instead of any non-cement based candy.
38624,best newspapers to read,"still mixed up - hes trying to say that you should try, from time to time, to read a paper that doesnt align with your views - thus why telegraph for a leftie, and guardian for a rightie."
12961,best gifts for mom,The gift that keeps on giving. And taking.
65377,best phone service company,"I was with Verizon for a long time and they had great coverage and never had any issues. I recently switched(Bill was too high) to Google Fi and find the coverage on the same level as Verizon. So it depends on your area and needs. I would say try them out if you can, before you switch fully."
53989,best medicine for a cold,"Oh yes, the Mad Orange Disease."
25119,best spiderman actor,JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was the best
6924,best iPhone,"I’m glad to see the 6S is getting some love in this thread. It was one of the greatest iPhones ever and easily the most underrated. It was especially interesting because it came right after the iPhone 6, which was the worst iPhone ever. The 6S was visually the same, but boy was it ever different on the inside.


If I had to rank the flagship iPhones from best to worst, in terms of how impressive they were at the time of release, I’d go something like this:

**Tier 1:** iPhone, iPhone 4, iPhone X

**Tier 2:** iPhone 5, iPhone 6S

**Tier 3:** iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, iPhone 7

**Tier 4:** iPhone 3GS, iPhone XS, iPhone 3G

**Tier 5:** iPhone 6

Those are also roughly in order of best to worst within each tier. I’m excluding the Max/Plus sizes as well as all the non-flagship models."
36332,best alcoholic drink,"White wine... I can get a bottle for $5, it doesn't upset my stomach like beer, and doesn't get me fucked up like hard alcohol. Plus to me it's more enjoyable to drink than red wine."
15880,best sunglasses for fashion,"I have 2. A no name pair of wayfarers for the beach, and some American Optical sunglasses for anything else."
46350,best trick or treating candy,"It might not be as big of a deal, but try to make sure there's a clear, large enough path to your door.  Here in Oregon it will probably be raining, and only an ass would make young dressed up kids walk through a muddy lawn."

58507,best cologne,"I can make suggestions of many fragrences, but they are a personal thing and you have to find yours.  Scents can smell differently from person to person due to body chemistry.  

There are so many to try, I suggest that you try a sample pack at [The Perfumed Court](http://theperfumedcourt.com/Categories/Samplers--Sample-Packs.aspx). That way you can try a range of unique scents and see what works for you, while not spending a lot."
16870,best pet for toddlers,"My 3 year old informed me that fish are not pets because you cannot ""pet"" them. I have to say I agree with him. For most people, a fish would not be an appropriate substitute if they have their heart set on a dog."

44876,best items under $100,"My library always had quite a handful of homeless people either reading or just chilling, never bothered anyone. There was an older homeless man in particular I think about very often, he was always reading or always typing on a computer whenever I'd visit, and once I was looking at the books behind him while he was on a computer and saw that he was printing out and filling job applications. I saw him very constantly for a couple of years, but at some point I just didn't see him again. I hope he was able to get employed and is living a good life now."
35031,best NFL player,"I agree, he really was *that* good, it’s not even exaggeration... he’s the all around football GOAT imo... but then again, half of this sub probably remembers Peyton mostly as a Bronco, so it’s not like they really saw Rice in action"
