6924,"I’m glad to see the 6S is getting some love in this thread. It was one of the greatest iPhones ever and easily the most underrated. It was especially interesting because it came right after the iPhone 6, which was the worst iPhone ever. The 6S was visually the same, but boy was it ever different on the inside.


If I had to rank the flagship iPhones from best to worst, in terms of how impressive they were at the time of release, I’d go something like this:

**Tier 1:** iPhone, iPhone 4, iPhone X

**Tier 2:** iPhone 5, iPhone 6S

**Tier 3:** iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, iPhone 7

**Tier 4:** iPhone 3GS, iPhone XS, iPhone 3G

**Tier 5:** iPhone 6

Those are also roughly in order of best to worst within each tier. I’m excluding the Max/Plus sizes as well as all the non-flagship models.",best iPhone

There are so many to try, I suggest that you try a sample pack at [The Perfumed Court](http://theperfumedcourt.com/Categories/Samplers--Sample-Packs.aspx). That way you can try a range of unique scents and see what works for you, while not spending a lot.",best cologne

There was an older homeless man in particular I think about very often, he was always reading or always typing on a computer whenever I'd visit, and once I was looking at the books behind him while he was on a computer and saw that he was printing out and filling job applications. I saw him very constantly for a couple of years, but at some point I just didn't see him again. I hope he was able to get employed and is living a good life now.",best items under $100
