"I was in Manzanita for 2 quarters and didn't like it. I mean the room was cool, the dining commons was good, but people weren't very social. Mostly creepy actually. My own room mate wasn't social at all. I was a transfer but he was a 4th year that lived in the dorms all four years. I moved out to IV after 2 quarters and loved it but I would choose one of the other dorms."

"I may have brought this up in another thread, but consider a non-all inclusive.  I have been going to Cancun for many years, and the all inclusive resorts have been killing off the local restaurants and cultural offerings.  Not to mention, the way many of these resorts offer such low cost, is paying their employees absolute crap and cutting corners on amenities, often times to make up for a bad week, month or quarter.   It's really sad actually."

"See, those sound lovely. That's the kind of thing my mom wants me to make."

Thanks! Is there a ton of overlap between ESL and Applied Predictive Modeling?
This movie remains on my top 10 list to this day. One of my absolute favorites. It’s one of those that I wish I could go back and rewatch for the first time again.
"good morning man/lady! it was raining a lot yesterday, so the air is much fresher than usual :)"
"Exactly. No one likes ""that"" side of the bridge."
Light Blue is incredible.
Jim Thorpe was one of the few people who gave the NFL credibility back in those days.

"I don't think anti-vaxxers, or any significant portion of people are reading scientific studies regardless of paywalls."
