Unless you plan to dance on stream an expensive HD Webcam is a complete waste of money.

A Webcam helps you connect with your audience by letting them see your reactions. A cheap one does that just fine.",best webcamera

14672,"So I read the first and got half way through the second before I had to give up. The first was WAY too fast paced for me! Felt like all the events in the book were crammed and not well thought out. I thought the second one would be better and I was wrong, her books are normally great and I am really enjoying The Chosen at the moment. But I agree with you on The Bourbon Kings series . It doesn't feel like she put much heart into it for me. The drama is even kind of lame to me which sucks because she is my favorite romance author.",best romantic novel

37946,"It is not a two-part film. Infinity War and Endgame were written and shot as two separate films with their own narratives. IW is a complete story about Thanos' conquest of the stones, and it ends with his victory. EG is about the heroes' response to his victory. They are two distinct films. It's the whole reason the titles were changed from ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part I and II"". The Russos didn't want people to think it was one movie split into two.",best Marvel movie
3727,"It might be different in the UK and elsewhere, but one of the problems with academic rankings in the US is that a large portion of the data that's used to create the rankings are provided by the institutions themselves. This allows them to omit some statistics, embellish others, and also generally introduces variability due to how different institutions answer the same question. For example, for faculty:student ratio, different universities will count faculty in different ways. Do you count the medical staff at the university-run hospital? Some do, some don't. These days I think most do, because they're aware of how the system works and how to game it, but counting personnel like that makes for a metric that doesn't mean the same thing for every institution.

TL;DR In large part I think school rankings are very course-grained. In the US, at least, the top 10-20 schools generally or in a particular category probably belong there, and the top 100 schools probably belong in that range, too. But the differences between the 2nd and the 5th or the 32nd and the 47th are not likely of any significance, at least not as measured by the rankings.",best college for research
4350,"""Best"" is rather utterly subjective, but the ones I've used/liked are..

- Programmers Notepad: Very simple, fairly customizable. Doesn't have much in the way of scriptability. Is free.
- e Text Editor: Paid. Basically a TextMate clone on Windows (supports textmate bundles, and is programmable in shell-script/python/ruby/etc).
- Sublime Text: I really like this editor, it does things very sensible - although it's still quite early in development. Supports TextMate .tmBundles too now. First text editor I've seen to put emphasis on a tiling UI.",best text editor
13820,"* [The Dieter's Paradox](http://www.myscp.org/pdf/short%20articles/JCPS_10-00088_180.pdf) — because people estimate that more food means less calories. Fascinating!

* Not a paper, but really insightful into a particular set of researchers: [Talking Nets: An Oral History of Neural Networks](http://www.amazon.com/Talking-Nets-History-Neural-Networks/dp/0262011670).

* [""How reliable are the results from functional magnetic resonance imaging?""](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05446.x) - but I prefer [this version much more!](http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf). — it shows how *not* to do things in fMRI - with fish!

* And [Haxby's](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/293/5539/2425) classic 2001 paper — one of the *coolest* papers to show that there are specific parts of the brain that respond in specific ways to specific types of stimuli.",best research paper archive
14781,"I really loved it because I like to think that I would act the way they did if I were in their shoes. I sometimes get irritated at books that have the sassy young heroines who act in a way that I think an adult person would not. But yes, radiance is such a wonderful book.",best romantic novel
62230,"Try the Metro series and get to Metro Exodus. You could play Exodus with skipping the first two but you'd be missing out.
The first two are relatively linear shooters, (with some larger areas), Exodus is bigger, almost open world, think of the recent Tomb Raider trilogy in terms of scope.

They have amazing atmosphere.",Best RPG game on PS4

46441,"When I was younger I remember going to one house where nobody wanted to go. To describe it imagine your stereotypical haunted house. That is what it looked like, so little kids would not want to go there. Well me and my friends passed it and I was dared to go up there by myself. Well not wanting to be a bitch about it I went up there and knocked on the door. An old man answers the door and even before I could say Trick or Treat he had grabbed me and raped me.
