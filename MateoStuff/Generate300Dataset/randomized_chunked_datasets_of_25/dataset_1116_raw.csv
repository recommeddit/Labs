"Haha! Because while my fianc√©e does like coasters and is supportive of my hobby, she has to draw the line somewhere üòÇ"
The phone would just be as thick as the iphone 4
"Maybe, if you don't mind crooked tongue [dogs](https://i.imgur.com/KjTg3.jpg)."
Desert is more complicated but has a LOT more replay value IMO. Island is a good introduction to co-op board games but Desert has way more variety.
"Lol, I was just making a garbage joke about Peterson hitting his son with a switch. This is totally the response my comment deserved."
HE'S FROM MINNESOTA?!?! I'm so proud.
What is a better name then?
Behind The Curve is a truly great one. Surprised it isn‚Äôt already listed
That was my second choice... Equally delicious!
"Shortmoji is in the list . I have FlicksForAll in the iOS 13 list but I don‚Äôt know if it works for 14 .

A lot of big companies 'had the means' to pivot to the next new or best thing in their industry but didn't. Many companies are too unwilling to kill their golden goose to pivot.
Its incomprehensible
"since it‚Äôs so much like the app store, it almost reminds me of white door 5.1...? or 6.0 because it combined cydia and the app store. obviously that would be cool now (installer instead or choice of package manager) but idk how useful it‚Äôd be because of the lack of an untethered jailbreak"
"oddly enough, this one. https://www.etsy.com/listing/196292061/the-rhymers-club-perfume-oil-absinthe?ga_search_query=rhymers&ref=shop_items_search_1"

Awesome!
I just make up words to try and sound like I know where i am. I don‚Äôt even know what an avicii is
"Death in Paradise is kind of genius because it‚Äôs so simple. 

One story each week, no real sub-plots or arcs, likeable characters, and some pretty famous guest stars (at least if you‚Äôre British)."
"My father left when I was one, so he's had that guilt now for 26 years."
I speak a very close derivative of Dutch and never realized this. I feel pretty stupid now. Hahahaha (Afrikaans)
Too much effort I got a shit load of repos
"Bonsai. My father has taken care of about 15 of them my entire life, and since they can outlive generations of families easily, I like to think he will continue to live on in them once he passes. I know after he is gone, there will be many days I spend out there, trimming the branches, having a nice chat with Dad. 

Edit: Im aware bonsai is a style, and that any type can become a bonsai tree. My dad doesn't just have 15 bonsais all of the same type, but I do agree it's important to be accurate. With that in mind, my favorite type would be the Californian Redwood Bonsai."
Go to Boston! It's the heart of American independence. Home of the American revolution. Also very beautiful and historical.  The New England Patriots are Bostons NFL team and currently #1 in the NFL. It's very cold this time of year too.
