"Everlane or Jansport? I have a 2 year everlane and I think I'm going to replace it since it's showing so much signs of wear. However I think it's still going fine.

Do you have other suggestions?"
"Cabin in the woods wasn't much of a twist ending though, they reveal it at the beginning."
"I only use uBlock Origin and Tampermonkey. I actually have a script that blocks all the things that uBlock Origin doesn't. I also have a bunch of other scripts, like one that always moves Continue Watching and My List to the top of Netflix. I used to make them ""sticky"" at the top of the screen, but that actually got annoying."
While VS 2008 is great it's a bit heavy for text editing.
TIL avoid all college majors
"I dont have a particular order but I also seem to enjoy relaxing idle like games too. My top list for this year seems to be: 

1. Metal Slug Infinity
2. Merchantrpg 
3. Immortal:Reborn
4. The battle cats
5. Cat game
6. Dungeon Maker 
7. Simplest RPG game
8. Minimal Dungeon
9. Melvor Idle 
10. Legends of Runeterra 

Idk when any of those games came out but that’s what I seemed to have played the most."
"I agree with you, I’m not a deep dish fan but I’m keeping it out of the post. That being said, there are distinct indicators of quality.  It’s safe to say that a burrito that comes with a cold mission tortilla is a low-quality burrito, just like pizza made outside of a good pizza oven with cheap sponge crust is likely a low quality pizza."
"I'd recommend the economist.  It gives a decent briefing on the week's news and then launches into a series of in depth articles, largely in a well-sourced editorial style where they argue for a particular point of view.  Well written and well worth your time."
"The Martian did that for me. A whole planet, hardly explored and all alone fighting for survival. Couldn't put it down."
The lecturer didn’t explain it well at all and I couldn’t figure it out so I used to go to the library to find books but sports therapy was very limited for study material.
"That mentioned nothing about toothpaste, just who had the whitest teeth within a group.  During that entire clip they never once mentioned anything about toothpaste or its whitening powers."
"Tap, because its the same as bottled without the plastic and comes from the same place, plus its more regulated thus safer than bottled water."
"""Hey man, we're all out of Dr. Peppers, but I have someone running out to get som-""


""ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS???  I'M TOM FUCKING PETTY'S GUITAR TECH!  HOW DARE YOU!""



""So, yeah, it'll be like 5-10 minutes on those Dr. Peppers."""
If you're interested in exploring careers/lives of scientists that took 'the path less traveled' then the [Jobs In Science Podcast](www.JobsInScience.ca) is worth a listen. I'd start with Ep3.
"I don't think Kendrick, Danny Brown or shadow belong in the top 10. Those are all great albums but I'd sooner include - ready to die, ob4cl, blueprint, mmlp, paid in full, college dropout, black album, get rich or die trying, it's dark hell is hot, Wu Tang forever"
Too bad the Devs gave up on it. I LOVE that game.
"I wouldn’t classify DS3, nier, BB or HZD rpg at all. They’ve got RPG elements but I find them more open world action"
boku no picco is pretty good. or so I've heard.
Make it happen!
Same. My kids are brutally tough on cables and the lifetime warranty is so easy for replacements.
How long have you been playing?

"I've got several mechanical keyboards with browns, blues, greens and clears. Got to say the Code with clears is the one I keep coming back to."
"I've had them for years, I can back this up. I switched to a toothpaste without SLS and they're MUCH smaller, less painful, and I get them much more infrequently."
"<and they're a bit easier to come by

But arguably meaner."
