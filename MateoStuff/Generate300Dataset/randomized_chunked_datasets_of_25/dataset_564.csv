52411,best hiphop album,"I said ""debatable"" because of its ranking on the top ten list. I'm not saying Illmatic isn't top 10. It's rank on that list? Debatable."
23420,best car racing video game,"Forza Horizon üòÅüòÅ.

On a serious note, dirt maybe"
289,best terminal file manager reddit,i like ranger
51171,best rap album,"i can't speak for the sub as one person but i dislike them because i feel they distill funk into trite, boring renditions that mostly appeal to frat bros."
70535,best major to study in college,What‚Äôs your major?
41766,movies like Inception,"OP, be ready to do some serious dissection, analyzation, and deductive reasoning if you're gonna watch the movie Primer. By far the most complicated and confusing movie I've ever seen. I still don't fully understand it."
17701,best iOS game,"Clash of Clans is the only online strategy game that isn't pay to win, at least compared to things like Lords Mobile, Rise of Kingdoms and so on. I'm not sure why people believe the opposite: you can only pay to speed up your buildings, but when you do you get paired with opponents of your same power level, so there isn't really an advantage."
3670,best college for research,"This is silly. For Europe, it mostly shows how centralized a country is. Take France, all of its top universities are in Paris (many of them), so only one dot is visible there. They're all small universities too (as compared to American ones), so you end up with several medium-sized dots on top of each other. Take Italy or Germany that have lots of medium-size cities of equal power with a a good/decent university in each, and you end up with tons of orange all across the place. Even though France's research output is between Italy's and Germany's.

You end up with a population map, with a very visible [blue banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Banana)."
59494,best perfume,"Probably a man, mid-20s to early-30s, I'd guess you work in something that's kind of stereotypically a man-dominated job like something with computers, something with cars, etc."
41647,movies like Inception,"Predestination....that's one serious mind f.....
Also Tenet is a good one, mind you I've watched it twice and still don't get it lol"
38344,best newspapers to read,"I like the New York Times and the Washington Post but my subscriptions are digital. 

Does your area only have one single newspaper? Is there another one you might consider supporting? Local journalism is where subscription dollars are best spent but unfortunately people who prefer paper are few and far between, so most resources are devoted to online formats."
35470,best alcoholic drink,"Here‚Äôs my favorite. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúDrink‚Äù
1. Take a lowball glass
2. Add 3 ice cubes. No more. No less. For Dale.
3. Pour Jim Beam over ice
4. Drink"
5686,best programming language for web development,"I've got HTML, CSS and am well into learning JS, now I'm thinking of starting some database management so I can get more well rounded in my skills, what is a good database language/system to learn? I guess what's considered most useful or most asked for (easier is good too haha)"
3183,best webcamera,"The Studio does not have the autofocus issue. But there may have been a firmware update that fixed the problem with the Cinema. Also, the autofocus issue only lasts about a second, so after that time, it's back to normal.

After a quick google, it looks like the autofocus can be disabled. If I were you, I would just try it out yourself before returning it. It's not going to affect your video calls too much, but for $15, I'd say it's worth it."
71824,best movies with a cool twist,You should check out the Chinese original. The first one was remade as The Departed and there are two sequels.

Ensiferum is awesome too!

+/u/dogetipbot 100 doge verify"
10332,best suitcase lock,"Wow, those went up in price. I was going to say one can pick up a starter pistol for $10, but I can't find one that cheap now.

Me and my friends bought these from the army surplus store. They fired little crimped .22 blanks, similar to nail gun charges."
39078,best web browser,This right here. These are hands down the best browsers on Windows right now.
19003,best YouTube video,"Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time, wasn't his name Top 10 memes before?"
