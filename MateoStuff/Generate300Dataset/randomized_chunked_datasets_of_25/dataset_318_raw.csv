"Talk to a travel agent. Don't feel you have to book through them, but they are a good resource. They can give you information on lots of different resorts from their previous customers' experiences. Then you can check what they suggest against reviews on tripadvisor or similar site. Who knows they might even give you a better price if you find it cheaper on the web."

"Just got back from my second cruise with Norwegian. 

* Had terrible flight days -- nightmare drivers on the way there and stranded in airport overnight on the way back. 
* Had one bad shore excursion, one rescheduled excursion, and one cancelled excursion. 
* Had an allergic reaction that kept me basically immobile for 3 days.

With all of that, I still had a freaking fantastic time.  The people are friendly. The food is great. The boat is clean and has tons of entertainment. When there's a problem, they are helpful. 

There's nothing better than sitting on a balcony over the open ocean at sunset, drinking a beer or a cup of hot tea, and reading some trashy genre novel with someone you love. I can't recommend it enough.

LPT: If you are on one of the older boats with mini-suites on the back of the boat, they are worth the upgrade. You'll get way more space, better service and a much better balcony for only 7-8% higher fare."
"I never need to, for I knew how good they were and they were only concerned about the chocolate, so I'd get them pretty much for the free.  There's tech in everything, even candy"

Uncle Luke- scarred 

2 live crew

Uncle Al (RIP, but if he can’t get you moving you probably have no pulse to begin with.)

Krayzie Bone (Heated heavy, get you twisted, I don’t give a fuck)

That last one was a lil Jon track but he has shit to get your blood going.

Many may be unfamiliar but old school Pitbull is undeniable. Forget any of the new stuff. Like seriously.

Digital Underground has fun energetic shit too.

MOP- ante up (you’ll get pumped and someone might end up bleeding)

Wu tang- gravel pit

Cool breeze- watch for the hook

OutKast- skew it on the Bar-b, Rosa parks, B.O.B., ghettomusick

Killer Mike- akshon ( or anything including RTJ)

Big Boi- kill Jill

Big K.R.I.T. Feat T.I. - big bank

Ludacris- move bitch

Three6 mafia"
"Thank you! That is a lot of good components for the price. I'm a little weary after reading the reviews on it, but I guess I won't know til' it gets here."
Have you even listened to TPAB? The joke was that there are barely if any 808s and hi hats on the album most of it was done with live instruments lol

"I don't know if this one has been mentioned. But as a ""starter"" book for children I think ""A Wrinkle in Time"" is a perfect way to kindle a child's interest in scifi. Loved this book as a kid."
"Same. They have buy one, get the next 50% off sales pretty often, which is where I picked up mine. I hope they keep expanding their styles, they are good quality for the cost."
"The Hindu: Other than the news, it has  excellent editorials, book reviews, if there is a game tonight (e.g. the EPL), it will post the channel name along with the timings (saves me a lot of googling). It's what newspapers used to be. I am yet to see an article that talked about where Hrithik Roshan/Salman Khan had dinner last night. 

The Indian Express: For it's pragmatic editorials. Though most of them end up bashing the the Congress party, it's not that irritating and are usually written in a 'matter of fact' manner.

EDIT: I am yet to meet a UPSC candidate who doesn't subscribe to the above newspapers.

Magazines (not related but chipping in): The Outlook - for the regulars namely, pollscape, book reviews, movie reviews, The Secret Diary of (oh, it's so not over the top like the Unreal Times is) and finally, the last page called, Diary is a fun read (Bombay Diary, Delhi Diary, Beijing diary etc)"
