68584,best science fiction novel,"I only read Echopraxia and thought it was utter garbage and liked Dune very much... Scifi is all about taste. First which genre, next which setting.... but in those categories there are some essentials imho (those who helped define or bring the subgenre forward) and you will somewhen stumble on to them and most likely read them. Who cares if someone else thinks bad about it, that doesn't matter, but some will be classics/essentials.

They are also not classic/essentials because of lack of competition, but because of going new ways (or old ways in a new fashion). It would mean, that there are only about 200 great scifi books, since they are the only ones in those lists. No... the others were not good enough or have been long forgotten. Scifi always had the cliche of being a trash genre and at the core this is not so wrong... there is a lot of shit printed and titled Scifi out there and has been in the past.

33102,best energy drink,"Yes I love how the savory taste of vegetable oil combines with flavors named after colors.

No seriously, [look at the ingredients](http://www.beveragesdirect.com/detail-682-AMP_Energy_Drink_24_Pack.asp).  They put oil in there so you'll drink it faster.  YUMMMMM.
