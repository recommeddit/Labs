35820,best alcoholic drink,"In no particular order (and not all of them tonight)

* Margarita - I like rocks no salt. 
* Mint Julep - Kentucky Derby is coming up
* Vodka Tonic - When i started drinking I thought gin tasted like pine tree and hair spray (I've grown to like it). The easy work-around is Vodka Tonic and lime. If its hot or if you're drinking for a while, this is the go to drink.  
* Moscow Mule, a classic but a good one. 
* Pina Colada (or any daiquiri) - Come summer, yes please.
* Mimosa - Careful, champagne sneaks up on you. 
* Fruity Tropical Drinks - (mai tai, rum runner, hurricane) there's a time and a place for these and they're wonderful. As an everyday drink, not so much. 
* White Russian - its not the 90's and you're kind of an asshole if you order one at a bar, but everyone should try one once. 
* Irish Coffee - if its cold on a Sunday morning, and you understand that there's like .5% alcohol in it. 
* Red Wine - Save that for when you're older. Waking up to a red puke-stained toilet bowl in your 20s is less than fun. 
* Sake - I love sake, but again, time and place. Nobody just orders a sake at a bar. But, if the mood is right, and you'll know, it is good stuff. 
* Tequila Sunrise/Screwdriver - Try it. If you like it, good. Most people are ho-hum on it. 
* Beers - probably the safest bet on your 21st. I like darks, but all the beer snobs like IPAs, find what you like and stick to it. For my money, there's nothing better than a Guinness. 

And

* A Bloody Mary tomorrow morning. Btw, there's a huge difference between a good Bloody Mary (spicy, zesty, good consistency) and watered down tomato juice. 

Happy Birthday BTW!

EDIT: OH SHIT! I FORGOT MY FAVORITE DRINK: THE CUBA LIBRE. Drink these all night amigo."

13872,best research paper archive,My favorite is [Feline High-rise Syndrome: 119 cases](http://www.scribd.com/doc/35730924/Feline-high-rise-syndrome-119-cases-1998%E2%80%932001). I found it a really neat read with pretty cool statistics about cats and apartment buildings.

69811,best major to study in college,"Something you have at least 50% passion for + what everyone else has already mentioned (STEM + comp sci).

I went the MD route, but only had partial passion from the start. Yes, I makes lots of money and can live on my own, but am banging my head sometimes over why I didn't go the comp sci route (loved math, programming, and cryptography... plus computers >> humans)."

4748,best home improvement store,"I was a manager for Home Depot some time ago. I still go to the one I worked the longest at. Not many employees left from when I worked there but it's nice to connect.

It depends on what I need and what the current policies are. For locks my local HD is charging to rekey while Lowes is not, so I buy locks at Lowes. Lowes decided they won't cut PT plywood so I buy that at Home Depot. I went to buy a washing machine on short notice, HD went to order only so I couldn't lock one up same day. I drove down the street and bought one at lowes.

In general Lowes is cleaner and more organized. They carry less sku's and have lower staffing to customer ratio. If you know what you want and they have it you'll get in and out Lowes faster than HD. Every once in a while I walk out of Lowes because they don't carry basic things you'd expect them to. For example they don't have Uni-strut, 

HD carries more stuff and has more staff so tend to be better for specialty items."

71891,best movies with a cool twist,Jesus Christ. Why didn't I ever think about that? That makes everything so much worse.
26418,best politician,"Lot of stupid answers ITT, I am going to give you an honest one.

I work in municipal government, but I'm not an elected official.  I do hold a separate elected office though.  

If you are talking about local and not national level stuff, what you really need to be is honest, and by honest I mean brutally honest with people.  If something can't be done or something is unrealistic that people might want, you need to be open and honest about it and explain why it can't be done.  Even if people seem angry, in the end they will appreciate the fact that you gave them a straightforward, truthful answer.  

One of the biggest things of my job is the ability to give people bad news and make them understand that there is no simple answer to their problem.

In all honesty, I think that is the best advice.  You need to be social and talk to a lot of people but above all be honest.

If you're looking at national level stuff, most of these people are right you're going to need a considerable amount of money."
60820,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Seconding these. The ck ones are now a few years old but all of them (except the last one) were hysterical. Chapelle has 4, two are hits and two are softer (imo i like 1 and 4). Mulaney is pretty good. Haven't seen burr or brennan."

552,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"Xodo is fine but quirky and good for simple stuff, I use it 95% of the time and it's free, so no reason not to try. Drawboard offers more features but is a little more complicated.  Fuck using Onenote for PDFs unless you're particularly masochistic. 

They all have different UI's and they are all a pain in the ass for casual use.  The disparate UI issue is an MS problem from 3.1 so no change their."
