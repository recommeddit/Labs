+1 for Teenage Bounty Hunters! Surprised me but I was sad when the season ended. Also Highly Recommend Broad City!
No use in covering your $300 - $1300 iPad with a cheap screen protector. Elecom isn't even that expensive
"I mean...she really didnâ€™t need to suck an already erect dildo, but Iâ€™m glad I know the order sequence."

"No no I like control lol. I just would like a touch more speed. I was interested in the hien before I bought this but Iâ€™m not sure if I want that one because Iâ€™m worried about stopping power not being a thing, thoughts?"
Trackmania. I love the arcade full speed tracks and the sense adrenaline you get taking extremely high speed corners.
The real board games of 2020 were the friends we social distanced from along the way.

"And? The alternative is belief in an absolute code of morality that is unchanging across time and place, which is easily disprovable. Moral systems change, and with them, acceptable behavior. The alternative is the belief that vast swaths of human beings have lived immoral lives for most of their existence.

Take an absolutist view on homosexual rights, for example. Already, we are limiting the pool of moral people to anyone born in a Western country in the last twenty years, to say nothing else of these people. 

Hell, we don't even have a consensus on moral codes today - some view abortion as infanticide and others as a woman's right to her own body. In the absence of moral certainty, one must default to legal institutions as the only criteria by which justice can be defined, or accept that no objective standard on a just war will ever exist and that the question is inherently meaningless."
