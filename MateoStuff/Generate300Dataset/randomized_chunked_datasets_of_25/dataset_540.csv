64162,"I double checked to see if the nested genres worked out of the box or if they needed some specific setting and [found the manual entry for it](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/sub_groups.html).

Oh, and one thing I like to share that I came up with which is useful if you have lots of metadata entries in one category, like genres. I entered an empty txt file into Calibre as a new book and gave it ""AAA Notes"" for the title and ""AAA AAA"" for the author so it always floats to the top in alphabetical sorting. Alternately, use Zs to push it to the bottom and out of sight. I then tagged it with entries like ""A -----"" ""B ------"" ""C -----"" etc. In alphabetical sorting, like in the genre picker menu, they help add space and make for easier referencing for the tags, otherwise my eyes just swim with all those entries. The dummy book also holds temporary tags and tags I expect to use in the future so that they're already present in the database for me to select. I use the text file itself to add notes on calibre and ebooks in general. I have a few thousand books in my library and it's helped add some order when filling in metadata. I've since done something similar with my music library and it's helped too.",best place to pirate audiobooks reddit

22380,"When my dad was about 9 (1964ish) he was on a plane from LA to Heathrow in coach with his mom. The stewardess came back and excitedly asked him if he wanted to ‚Äòmeet a beatle??‚Äô

My dad said sure but didn‚Äôt really know the Beatles at that age, and only said yes because that‚Äôs kinda what you do at that age. He sat on the couch next to George (different time, airlines treated you like people), George folds up his newspaper and says, ‚Äúsoo, do ya like my music?‚Äù

My dad says (like a confused 10 year old) ‚Äúum, no‚Äù. Apparently George smiled and went back to reading his newspaper. My dad sat there like a doofus for like 5-10 minutes until the stewardess came and got him.

So George Harrison was cool to children, and my dad‚Äôs the most Stone cold 10 year old ever",best celebrity

50792,"Yeah man, I definitely get where you‚Äôre coming from. Coming off their great 2018 release combined with post humorous DOOM verses I was beyond psyched for this album.

Oh my first few listens it did seem a bit anemic and rushed, especially with DOOM‚Äôs verses kinda  haphazardly tossed in places. But the album really grew on me with repeat listens.

Also, I do agree Deck was definitely second to Eso‚Äôs devastating flow but he brought a milder energy that allowed Eso to shine I think. Also off tracks like ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù he still put up a good performance.",best rap album

8712,"Hydroxyapatite toothpastes have been popular in Japan for decades. Any Japanese dentists reading this?

I can't tell from the literature whether nanohydroxyapatite remineralizes better than fluoride, but people swear by it. It's said/claimed to get calcium deeper into teeth than fluoride, making enamel whiter and more opaque. Since it apparently works great, I was surprised to not find progress pics online. It's hard to even find studies lasting more than a few days. 

I started using Apagard recently. I'm making my own progress pics, and if I stick to the program I'll post them someday. I'm guessing it'll take a long time for calcium to migrate inward.

Don't fall for the ""regrowing teeth"" crap. Deep remineralization alone would be awesome.",best toothpaste
