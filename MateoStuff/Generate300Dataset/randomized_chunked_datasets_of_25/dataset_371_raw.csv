"Amazon had the Asus zenbook 13 with a 1 TB SSD and 16 GB RAM for 1k, and I delayed my decision [and it's back up to $1150 now](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KH53NKR/ref=nav_timeline_asin?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1). 

Is there any chance of it becoming cheaper again, on Amazon or anywhere else, in the next 6 months? And any place I can monitor to check its price across websites?

I have an asus zenbook which i love but the storage space (256GB) has been too low for my work."
Omg I LOVED teenage bounty hunters and was truly shocked with the ending. I hope there is a second season soon!

"Understood. I didn't want to use a freelancer because I want to keep the budget as low as possible and in turn it will help me gain the most knowledge also.

However, I now understand that it won't be easy for me to deliver this service in time. Maybe I will present a few key features of the website as proof of concept at the conference and take my time to develop the website in its entirety, maybe until the end of this year?

In regards to the other bit of your advice, you are suggesting I use JavaScript for both front end and back end development, right? And that MEAN stack is the way to go about it?

What do you think about u/aramboyajyan's advice that I use Django because I know a bit of Python already? Do you have any experience with that?

Thanks for taking the time to help me!"
"Itâ€™s possible weâ€™ve talked about this before, but since there wasnâ€™t a thread about it fully, why is Homecoming in the bottom tier?"
"I'm suprised, no one mentioned *Malazan book of the dead*, by Steven Erickson. it's 10 book in total, plus side novels, so lots and lots of reading. The story has multiple threads, all connecting at most surprising points. Magic is there, and in not seen anywhere else form. Characters are vivid, and even if they live short and die ugly, there's a meaning to that. I think this has the most potential to call it epic.

Edit: First book is called *Gardens of Moon*."
"I second this.

"Hey Physio\_Tool - that's a fair comment! I would say the key word there is ""arguably"". Personal productivity is such a broad topic that drawing the line is more art than science.

&#x200B;

I would argue that reading and implementing the lessons in *any* of the other books in that top 10 would give you a massive boost in productivity - especially when you extend the definition of productivity from independence (getting my own stuff done) to interdependence (working with other people to get stuff done).

&#x200B;

Thanks for your thoughts though! If you have anything you'd add to the list I'd love to know about it."

Believable characters and situations. Fully fleshed out characters. No bullshit storylines. 

Give it a try. Shit gets real on the first episode.

Edit: not on Netflix."
"Well, like I said in another comment, it seems to be staffed almost entirely by idiots. I hardly ever go there, and yet I've had more problems with product being out of stock at that store, when the website said it was in stock, than at all the other metro-Indy Menards stores *combined*. Product is frequently not where it belongs on the shelves. Employees don't know where things are.  On-line orders that supposedly were picked and wrapped, ready to be picked up, are nowhere to be found.

Yes, the store opened only a few years ago, but that shortly followed the closing of their previous east-side store at Pendleton Pike and Shadeland -- which *also* was a dud, for the same reasons I cited above, and in addition was small, dirty, poorly lit, and poorly maintained. I suspect that much of the staff, and all of the management, are holdovers."

"I think it's ironic that the same board that pooped its pants over the Equifax breach and kept telling everyone to immediately pay money to freeze their credit would also advertise services that ask for your login info  of all your financial accounts and aggregate them in one place for the sake of convenience and pretty graphs.

"While I do like Zebra and I do like Sileo you did point out a fact that does irk me a little.

Sileo has a huge backing by a very senior and arguably more talented devs, including Kirb, CoolStar, Andy Wiik, and AppleBetas.

Also to leave out the founder and the creator of most of the huge parts of Zebra, Wilson. Shame on you....

This makes me not like this post more.

Also on top of that Pwn20wnd has not contributed to Zebra at all... and is riding the coattails free and wild (see https://github.com/wstyres/Zebra/graphs/contributors)

If you are going to compare repo managers please get your facts correct."
"Yes, and the latest of the two is SCSS."
"I only have 4 names to share since I own only 5 stocks and one isn't a long-term hold. In order of conviction:

1. ROKU: More households cutting the cable cord should continue to support active accounts, especially internationally + advertising $$$ shifting from linear to streaming. I have a $420 - $500 price target


2. IDXX: Don't confuse this with IDX being pumped from Wall Street Bets. This is a better stock that does diagnostics for pets. Continued innovation in animal Healthcare + more people owning pets + people caring more for their pets = more tests for pets. $745 price target


3. ZTS: Another solid animal health stock, #1 in animal pharmaceuticals. Although it's my #1 best-performing stock, lower on the list because it's more mature at almost a $100b market cap.


4. TTWO: Best-in-breed video game developer best positioned to benefit from Xbox Series X/PS5 console cycle due to higher mix of console revenue + the metaverse since they have proven open-world intellectual property like GTA and Red Dead Redemption. My price target is only $175, but it can go higher depending on news about the pipeline and personally believe this is my #1 upside stock, but with higher risk."
"While Santa Ana was holed up for thirteen days at San Antonio, Sam Houston was busy turning the eastern half of Texas into Russia.  He took what supplies he could and burned what he couldn't.

On itsmarch east, Santa Ana's massive army couldn't supply itself effectively.  When they got to Lynchburg they were on their last legs, which is when Sam Houston struck, routing the Mexican army and capturing Santa Ana"
