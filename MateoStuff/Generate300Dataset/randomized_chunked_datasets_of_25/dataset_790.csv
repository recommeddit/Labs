37618,"Thats not the only reason.

Black Panther is the first MCU film to operate outside the inhouse style before it. Coogler brought in his own composer, DP, production designer, sound team. So it looks and feels unique to any other MCU. Its up to fans to determine what is ""better""

However, I the MCU fans grade it harsher because it doesn't do what MCU films typically are A+ at (action/CGI)

Also the nuanced story telling hit home for a lot of people. A lot under the surface.",best Marvel movie

56411,"Just returned the 27inch and got the 32 inch from B&H for cheaper than anywhere else ($699 at B&H). Immediately feel I love with the curved screen, the immersion is just awesome. But 1000R curved screen on a 27 inch just wasn't enough screen real estate for me, felt like it was a 25 or 26 inch monitor.

11312,"I'm not divorced but I know several divorcees, and sometimes two people just can't mesh, no matter which way you try. Two people can be civil with each other, even friendly, but put them in the same living space and shit gets volatile. It's better for the kids to end the marriage and raise the kids as friends than try to ""stick it out"" for the kids' sake and let them watch a disastrous relationship evolve over the years, setting them up for the same pattern in their own adult lives. 

Incidentally, you can see this happen quite commonly among young college students. They make friends, decide to rent an apartment together, and in one year you have two (or more) people who can't stand to live with each other any more.",best gifts for dad

The screen is meant to be used without one, along with using the pencil that way. The finger prints do suck but a super microfiber cloth is easy to carry around in your bag. Just my opinion. Good luck.",best matte screen protector for ipad
