17360,best iOS game,Seriously? A Kim Kardashian game got in there?
47231,best state to visit in the United States,"Come to Baltimore! Despite the bad rep that the city gets, it's not  bad. Come see the Ravens play, go to the Aquarium, the Zoo, the harbor, plus Fells Point has tons of bars. There is a tons of historical stuff, and it is in close proximity to a lot of other surrounding places as well. Plus, the best crabs and crab cakes in the country!"
60610,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I Think You Should Leave. It's six episodes, 15 minutes each, and it's [pure insanity](https://youtu.be/WLfAf8oHrMo)."
8969,best toothpaste,I use it too. The Doggies smell like mint!
14112,best place to get free books,Does this work for Kindles?
46007,best trick or treating candy,They are called strawberry bonbons and they are indeed “super good.”
37618,best Marvel movie,"Thats not the only reason.

Black Panther is the first MCU film to operate outside the inhouse style before it. Coogler brought in his own composer, DP, production designer, sound team. So it looks and feels unique to any other MCU. Its up to fans to determine what is ""better""

However, I the MCU fans grade it harsher because it doesn't do what MCU films typically are A+ at (action/CGI)

Also the nuanced story telling hit home for a lot of people. A lot under the surface."
38511,best newspapers to read,The newspapers I get for free in the morning and evening in the metro/subway
11683,best gifts for dad,hatred towards me
56411,best desktop monitor,"Just returned the 27inch and got the 32 inch from B&H for cheaper than anywhere else ($699 at B&H). Immediately feel I love with the curved screen, the immersion is just awesome. But 1000R curved screen on a 27 inch just wasn't enough screen real estate for me, felt like it was a 25 or 26 inch monitor.  
  
I mostly play games like Metro, Fallout 4, Control, ARPG's, and turn based RPG's like Divinity and Wasteland."
40783,best instrument to play,"I'm a guitarist myself, but drums are so dang fun to play."
60653,Best comedy show on Netflix,Paradise pd lol
11312,best gifts for dad,"I'm not divorced but I know several divorcees, and sometimes two people just can't mesh, no matter which way you try. Two people can be civil with each other, even friendly, but put them in the same living space and shit gets volatile. It's better for the kids to end the marriage and raise the kids as friends than try to ""stick it out"" for the kids' sake and let them watch a disastrous relationship evolve over the years, setting them up for the same pattern in their own adult lives. 

Incidentally, you can see this happen quite commonly among young college students. They make friends, decide to rent an apartment together, and in one year you have two (or more) people who can't stand to live with each other any more."
65461,best phone service company,"Maybe i missed, but is international roaming considered/listed?"
42693,best detective show,"""If-Then-Else"" is one of my favorite episodes of TV, ever."
73837,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I honestly wouldn’t get anything. I’ve been an iPad only user since around 2016-ish and have never used any type of screen protector of any kind. The screen is meant to be used without one, along with using the pencil that way. The finger prints do suck but a super microfiber cloth is easy to carry around in your bag. Just my opinion. Good luck."
15555,best tree for the garden,"Look up Mark Shepard as a start, then start following the links until you get tired of reading.  

There are groups of trees that will give you some produce in a few years and a ton of things in 10 or so."
11117,best backpack for college,"I agree, I've had my blue ll bean backpack for 7 years, and its held together. Mine is very similar the the picture you linked. Yes, it was also kind of a status symbol when kids got theirs monogrammed"
35834,best alcoholic drink,How the hell do you know OP! You're just turning 21!

21396,best workout music,"1. AC/DC - Long Way to the Top
2. Twisted Sister - We're Not Gonna Take it
3. Mettalica - For Whom The Bell Tolls"
574,best vpn for torrenting reddit,Use [cyberghost](https://7proxiesdeep.com/more-information/cyberghost-vpn-trial/) since it has no logs and they don't keep any of your data.  It's also pretty fast so your downloads go quick.  Another good one with no logs is [ExpressVPN](https://7proxiesdeep.com/more-information/express/) but it's more expensive
