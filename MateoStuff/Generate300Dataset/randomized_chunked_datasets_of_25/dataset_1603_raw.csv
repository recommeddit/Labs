"Read up on OMAD (one meal a day) and IF. It can be very healthy to skip eating for a significant portion of the day. Don't eat if you're not hungry. Eating one large meal likely isn't as bad for you as you think, it can allow you to eat less in total but keep up your metabolism."

"I'm late, but [The Others](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230600/). The ending left me completely mind fucked."
Could someone please help me? What does open door/closed door mean in this context?
"aha the Rob Ford. 

edit: for clarity, Vodka and Gatorade is Rob Ford's drink of choice. I don't know if he does the slush thing but it sounds cool."
"Yeah handsome but not a straight up model face like maybe MJ or something. Peter is not ugly but neither is Tobey or Tom. Andrew is just way too handsome if you ask me.

How is Mary Jane poorly written? Need some explaination on that matter because that's what most people tend to say but that's subjective. What's your reason behind it."
I don't think that's how cold sores work. I'm pretty sure you're confusing them for canker sores or mouth ulcers.
"1. Wild Wild Country

2. Planet Earth 1 + 2

3. The Office

4. Documentary Now

There are documentaries that I'm glad I watched and are probably better made, like Icarus, but these are my favorites. And I'm counting the last two, close enough."
MAM.
You are basing that off of 2yrs. Lets see if he is consistent and if he can keep it up for at least another two years. He needs to win because of his QB skills not because of his defense for me to even consider him in that category.
Or just get an HDMI cable. Stream things straight from your computer to your tv for a huge fraction of the cost.
"No regrets about what im studying (studio art + business) i just wish my life had turned out differently than it did so far and it didnt take me so long to get to this point with nothing to show for it, i was a dropout for 5 years"
"Definitely add:

**Cash n' Guns** to your list.  It is an amazingly fun 4-8 player social/bluffing game which includes foam guns in the box for pointing at your friends to rob them of loot you stole.  Always a good time.

**Machi Koro** is another new gateway game. A great Japanese city builder.  Can be taught in less than 5 minutes. 

**Lords of WaterDeep** - a fun worker placement game.

**Smash Up** - excellent competitive card game where you pick 2 factions and smash them together into your deck and fight over area control.  Tons of variety with constant expansion.  My wife beats me every time."
"The Little Book of Perfumes narrows it down further to the top 100 out of the first book.  Iris Gris is the rarest, though maybe not the GOAT.  It probably depends who you ask."
Is terracube in Canada?
Same.  Season 1 was fantastic!
this is the wrong place to ask this question. This thread is just a bunch of peoples favorite rap records
"I have the 2nd gen SE and came from a 1st gen SE and the battery seems fine to me. My old battery barely held a charge tho, so anything would seem like an improvement, but I have my head in this stupid thing like half the day, and usually only have to charge overnight."
I don't know about top 10 but one my very first rpgs were Shining Force 1 and 2 on sega genesis and nobody remembers this awesome serie :)
"I disagree. The key system is not intuitive. It's ass backwards IMHO. 

I can play keys (I had a career doing sound design and music for games), but I wouldn't recomend it as a first to others.

If you are looking to play keyboards, I've seen complete beginners perform miracles on a hexagonal keyboard, but clearly that won't help here.

So Iâ€™m confused . Is it real-time  online?
"My sister planned this for my mom.  She turned 50 so we had a few less cards.  She read though about 10 of them before she asked for a new beer and my sister (the concept was her idea) was the one who cried.

Oh, the memories."
But Jesse I need to cook.
"> Xhr wasn't all that bad.

Xhr was dog shit back in the day. If I remember right you had to check for window.XMLHttpRequest and if that didn't exist it was a series of try/catch blocks for *various* ActiveXObjects depending on the versions of IE you were supporting."
