"""Dr. Death"" on Peacock is a new must-watch miniseries."
"Luke Wilson.

He golfed at the private course I work at. Could not have been nicer. Chatted with me for at least half an hour and answered all the crazy questions I had about Old School, That 70s Show, and Idiocracy. After all this he asked me where the men's locker room was so I obliged and he slapped me a 50$. I work at a non-tipping course so he knew he didn't have to. As he left he said, ""It was nice meeting you, 500channels,"" to which I replied, ""The pleasure was all mine, Godfather."""

I just thought that was pretty cool."
"Wage War, especially if i'm going heavy for that day, makes me want to rip doors off their hinges."

"You know what, a lot of people hate GoDaddy. And I mean really hate it. I’m talking about professionals - developers, coders, entrepreneurs and so on. But I don’t get it - surely they’re one of the most cost effective when it comes to WordPress website plans? Plus, you get a page builder with it and it’s super easy to use."
Trust me I am rooting for your success. But mine worked perfectly for 7 and a half years.  Then it froze over. And died.

"Jake by Hollister.  So good.  Every boy should wear it, cause then I'd be in heaven.

Don't wear Axe.  It's really, really disgusting."
"I've been wearing Mackie for 17 years. I haven't smelt it in almost as long, except for the first mist.

I can't wear anything else. My 15 year old daughter refuses to hug me and says I don't smell like mom anymore if I do. 

My husband always says I smell good after I put it on, but he's a serial complimenter sooo....I'm stuck with it for now. Or until my supply runs out, because it's a bitch to find!"

Killer Mike - RAP Music is a phenomenal album front to back and I can't recommend it enough.
"My uncle took his life at the falls last summer. We all thought for months that he had abandoned his car and jumped ( note left in car said only to call police when towed)  Turns out he climbed down to near the base of the falls, made himself comfortable and downed a bottle of benzodiazepines. Parks crew found him when doing a cleanup."
