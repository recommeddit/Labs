23271,"it's more to do with the game physics, arcade style games are designed to be not frustrating for people with no real-life fast driving experience and are designed to be totally playable with a gamepad. Car handling is usually greatly simplified, using the brake is often optional other than for hairpin bends, it's hard to go into a spin unless you screw up.

Sim games are designed from the ground up to have as reallistic physics as possible and to be played with a steering wheel, pedals and shifter. They are much more unforgiving, like real life, so it's easy to lose control of the car and going fast takes a lot of skill and practice. For many people it's too frustrating and they don't find it fun.",best car racing video game

38220,"It's not a newspaper, but I read AP just about every morning. Stick to ""top news"", and avoid ""big story"", though. The content of their articles is comprehensive and fact-based, but the stories they choose to report is a little iffy sometimes; they're quick to jump on bandwagons (for example, they're so eager to crucify cops that it seems they report on every officer-involved homicide, and have even strayed into non-lethal shootings where the suspect was armed and threatening the officer).

I've doodled a lot on my friends before buying my own, I can't feel a difference same grip to the pencil same softness level. On past matte i've dealt with some do tend to have larger grain (not sure if that the right term for it) which leads to better picture quality but definitely makes it less soft. I've only experienced these two so I can speak on the quality of any other US based ones though.
