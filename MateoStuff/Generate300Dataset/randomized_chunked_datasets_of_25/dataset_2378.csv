7264,"I’ve had mine since launch, and have had very very minimal issues with it. For your use, it should be more than fine, but for longevity, I’m not too confident. I made my 6 last 4.5 years after getting it at launch, so making a phone that’s already about 2 years old last another 4-5 might be pushing it. You could always replace the battery in a few years and make it last a bit longer. 

In my opinion, I always suggest getting the newest phone so you have the newest processor and battery to make it last. But from how you’ve phrased this it seems like you’re on a bit of a budget, so it’s hard for me to give you a solid answer. 

If longevity is your main priority, go for the newest one you can afford and wait for the AirPods to go on sale. If you really really want the AirPods as well, then the Xr isn’t a bad option.",best iPhone

I hated the feeling of drawing on glass and this feels just like drawing on paper with a chunky pencil. Better than PaperLike in every possible way.

You then can choose between Extract poured at 40% or Intense poured at 50%. I personally found 40% a brilliant option and not sure if I would go as far as 50% concentration.  Then you can choose the colour of the bottle. I think they also do engraving. https://ormondejayne.com/your-scent-your-strength-your-style/",best perfume
