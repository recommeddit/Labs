16530,best pet for toddlers,"Don't.

Wait until she's 5 or 6 before getting a pet.

Otherwise, you're just setting yourself up for a ton of extra work."
33912,best Pokemon game,"I was more referring to them on a technical level, with non-animated pokemon sprites and rudimentary 3d models. They're still pretty solid games overall, I was just very impressed with the technological leap between gens 4 and 5 considering they were on the same console."
44696,best items under $100,The best is almost universally recognized as the Patagonia capilene air. It’s a wool blend with blown fibres that have a hollow core. Very dreamy and warm.
30448,best Mexican war to study,"Not that it was a specific war but Emperor Justinian's reign is pretty fascinating to me. He so nearly managed to save the Roman Empire and hold it all together but in the end Justinian was truly Roman. Belisarius. Theodora. Antonina. All the intrigue, moral corruption, heroism and tragedy anyone could ask for all wrapped up in one epic reign. Shakespeare couldn't script it any better.

Yeah, give me a week in Constantinople circa 535."

18653,best YouTube video,"[TierZoo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw). If you haven't heard of him yet. He does information videos about animals as if they were classes on a video game. He goes over stats, skills, strategies, and other things."
9981,best portable charger,"It's really cheap, has an enormous battery, and lots of ports I doubt there is much in the way of power regulation between the battery and the output."
30418,best Mexican war to study,"This battle is explained rather well in the second installment of the PBS documentary, [Germs, Guns and Steel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-eQN9p6K2A)... Thanks to a stupid order the Incans never had a chance."
33243,best electric car,"As someone who’s owned plenty of Fords, I’d avoid the first year of any Ford product.  Just go look at the recent news about the Bronco and its disastrous rollout, tons of issues, and some customers who ordered early this year, won’t get their cars until end of next year.  And Ford and dealers have been jerking around customers for months. The Explorer rollout was also a disaster.  

I honestly wouldn’t trust them to deliver the Lightning in a timely manner.  It’s a cool vehicle no doubt, but I’d give it a couple of years of being on market before I’d pull the trigger on it.  They just don’t have the best reputation with new release vehicles lately"

67993,best science fiction novel,"Minor correction/clarification: while David Wong is currently the executive editor of Cracked.com, he wrote the book while working as a copy editor for insurance claims. *John Dies At the End* predates Cracked.com by about five years."
30535,best Mexican war to study,"Yeah, you're correct, I just got home and took a look as well. He makes four mentions of Chapultepec but does not go into any detail as he does with the engagements of the Civil War unfortunately (one of these mentions is of Longstreet falling wounded with the colours, and Pickett taking them from him; it contains these sorts of details)."

70291,best major to study in college,If you're still alive there's always an opportunity
41074,best instrument to play,I can play intermediate piano and advanced guitar. Because of the lockdown I ordered a bass guitar last week. I'm having so much fun because it's an instrument I can just pick up and am able to play many songs instantly. For me it feels more like a rythmic instrument than a guitar.

21674,best winnie the pooh comic,"I need to write a children's book: ""Everybody has an asshole"". Maybe my efforts will save other children from wasting their time trying to locate a bear's anus."
62454,Best RPG game on PS4,"If you got stuck playing the Witcher games, just ignore all the question marks on the map. Most of them are pointless, repetitive slogs.

You can play the game through doing only the main storyline quests with absolutely no issue. Personally I would also do the monster bounties because they are fun and provide some varied gameplay.

I'd also suggest choosing one of the Witcher armor sets ([bear, cat, griffin, and wolf](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_3_witcher_gear)) and doing the quests to get and upgrade that."
15649,best sunglasses for fashion,They just have this really strong late 90s early 2000s stereotypical woman vibe going on with the almost leopard print color scheme/pattern.
