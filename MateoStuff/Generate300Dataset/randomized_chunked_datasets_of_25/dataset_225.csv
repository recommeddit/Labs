15699,"Unfortunately these (wayfarer version) were amazing but I have not been able to find them in any Costco for several years across several states and many different stores.  Bummer, as I had a pair and would love to see them again.  Only seen the aviator ones the last few years. I try and leave a comment card at most stores to bring back the wayfarers, but seems unlikely at this point several years later.",best sunglasses for fashion

68184,"Yeah I feel that. I really feel that they should be more affordable. But they're a collaborative effort so you're paying more people, and they tend to print a lower number when compared to novels. I've never minded paying the money - but that's probably conditioning.

I don't get the e reader argument, but thats just because I'm old fashioned and haven't yet been converted to the modern tech. ðŸ˜Š",best science fiction novel
4058,"I did go through the whole program. I loved it. I mean it helped me leverage my prior experiences (fine art sales and exhibit production) so that Iâ€™m making much more money in a much more interesting environment. My program was 6k and worth every penny. 

Definitely do your research on the industry and be confident the program is something youâ€™re willing to commit to. Itâ€™s not enough to simply complete the program and expect a job to land on your lap. You definitely need to network and self educate and be genuinely interested in the work. The program is largely what you make it. Youâ€™ll get out of it what youâ€™re willing to put in. Not to mention the hiring process for these jobs can be very demanding and thereâ€™s nine million other people just as driven and ambitious as you are with just as good portfolios competing for the same roles, so you need to find your edge and really lean into that. For me, itâ€™s that Iâ€™m a great communicator and speaker, and add value to the teams Iâ€™m on because I am a great liaison between the stakeholders and the design team.",best online college

49589,"I've been gaming on proper monitors since I picked up the hobby again.  Not the best of the best but the best of the thrifty pieces.    


The jump from 60-144 was night and day,  Felt so much better.  Even scrolling as you mentioned,  It was a nice upgrade... Felt ""professional""  lol  I finally parked my 6700k and upgraded to something newer (3700x)  recently, and it pairs nice with my 2070.  So I said fuck it,  Upgraded the monitor to a 2560x1440/144hz  AOC. Not to expensive but better than wishdotcom products lol.      


Once again, I am grateful I made this choice, the upgrade was noticeable and I am enjoying old games a little more now that  I have it all dialed in.
