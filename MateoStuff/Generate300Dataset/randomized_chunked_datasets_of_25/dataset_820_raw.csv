"The saddleback isnâ€™t available for purchase yet. They just received their molds for the 12 series phones and should hopefully have some models released by late January 2021. Iâ€™m currently using the apple sleeve, but Iâ€™ll be ordering a saddleback once theyâ€™re available."

"Pros: History is phenomenal if you're planning on pursuing a masters degree. It is a very solid base for any future studies, especially for research. The skills you get in critically analyzing information and writing are invaluable. It's also incredibly fun to study if you are the kind of person who is fascinated by it.

Cons: Engineering and business majors will constantly talk shit about you and your degree, and there are almost no relevant jobs with just a bachelors. Basically you'll probably need to use it as either the starting point to a graduate degree or use it as a generic college degree that allows you to check the ""college graduate"" box on application forms."
You know that's right.

"I stand corrected re: the accreditation. It's hard to get over multiple bad personal experiences with any institution, though, and the fact that folks like my coworker were able to graduate doesn't speak well for the program, I'm afraid. Some of the cover letters I've received from graduates of Capella and Walden have been riddled with typos, run-on sentences, and so on. 

Sorry if I sound like an elitist asshole, but I'm just relaying my experience as a hiring manager. Clearly, there are some talented and intelligent folks attending these programs, so I'll do my best to be more open-minded next time there's an open position on my team."
It's soooo good.

"I hope the real LPT is to make your bag more difficult to get into than the next bag they see.

Same goes for anything, be it your house, your car, etc. Make it less appealing or more difficult than your neighbors."

Best: Always interesting and always challenging. 

Worst: Insane workload. 3 years of it destroys a lot of people, and terrible mental health is normal."
"On a similar note, a headlamp would be my recommendation for this thread. Great for when you dont have a free hand. I use mine all the time. Going up into the attic? Headlamp. Checking the breaker box at night? Headlamp. Digging out a tough splinter and need a bright light? Headlamp."
Haha! Thank you! Iâ€™m loving all of these recommendations and seeing what everyone enjoys. Iâ€™m so glad I did this post!

"I don't know your individual circumstances, so take the following as a general statement: 

Decay is primarily to do with your **diet** more so than anything else. Simply put, bacteria need sugars and an overabundance of this leads to decay.

So if you are drinking heaps of sugary drinks (juice, cola, etc) or eating sugary foods (ice creams, cereals with lots of sugar content, etc), it won't matter how much you brush because the bacteria will have an ample sugar supply. 

More so, frequent sugar intake (sipping your cola over time, snacking on sweets in between meals) amplifies the risk of decay. Why? Because you are giving the bacteria a prolonged exposure to sugar. Contrast sipping at coke while having a 4 hour gaming session with with drinking cola at dinner time - you tend to wash the sugar away with everything else at dinner but not during gaming. 

What isn't stated enough in oral health education is that toothbrushing prevents gum disease but only marginally helps prevent against decay. The fluoride in toothpaste that you use twice a day can only strengthen your teeth so much against the constant acidic attack from bacteria that occurs all day.  

Take home points?

1. Modify your diet to reduce sugar intake (that's good for your overall health too)
2. If you do drink/eat sugary foods, attempt to confine them to mealtimes
3. If it is between meal times, drink some water/milk after those sugary drinks
4. You can also buy extra fluoridated toothpaste - ask your pharmacist for which ones are available in your area. *And remember not to rinse after brushing - spitting out the excess is enough*."
