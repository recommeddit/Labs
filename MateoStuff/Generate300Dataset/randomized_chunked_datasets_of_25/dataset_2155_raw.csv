I said, ‚Äúexcuse me, I don‚Äôt know if you know this but you‚Äôre John Malkovich.‚Äù Then John extended his hand and said, ‚Äúindeed I am‚Äù and shook my hand. A kind gentlemen he was."
"That phone has been through a tough time and it‚Äôs still working, unbelievable lol!"
Can't be touched- Roy Jones Jr
"Mous, dbrand, & Nomad cases are my go-to."

"On my work PC, Firefox (this is /r/windows, after all).  On my Linux laptop, Firefox.  On my Android mobile, Firefox (Lite).  I only use a different browser (Safari) on my iPad."
"Wife and I each carry an [Aukey 10000mAh battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Delivery-10000mAh-Slimline-Compatible/dp/B079Z4RHZZ).  It has USB C, A and micro.  Can be charged and charge over USB C.  Airlines prefer smaller battery packs ([they have limits on battery size](https://blog.voltaicsystems.com/lithium-battery-policy-airline/)) so we went with 2 of these vs. 1 huge one."
"I feel like since Covid, I‚Äôve branched out a bit in my tastes bc I was so bored and ordered so many samples haha.  2 years ago, it‚Äôd be almost all aldehyde florals

"if you‚Äôre not opposed to reading subtitles, Sofia Ni√±o de Rivera currently has two specials up and they‚Äôre hilarious!"
"You know, that uncomfortableness might be a Yo-kai's fault, right?"
"Right, it obviously does *something*, but the question is whether that something makes the water 'safer'."

"My mom is always happy with gift cards to that one restaurant that's a little too nice to be spending your own budget money on but not so nice that it's uncomfortable. You know, those mid-nice places. That way she can treat herself a couple times throughout the year with her husband or friends guilt-free.
