11582,best gifts for dad,"That's a real fathers pride, cause you hand made it and thought of what he liked he will always carry it with him as it will remind him that he did a good job in raising you.  To you it might be ugly and worthless but to him it is more precious than gold and not something you would understand until your own child gives you something handmade without help and being told too."
42761,best detective show,That‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs always nice to know that people are cool !   I loved the series and the several twists.    It‚Äôs fun to have an unexpected ending.

3469,best college for research,"I would put UT Austin and Georgia Tech higher but other than that I agree with this list more than any other ranking list. That being said, I don‚Äôt really know a ton about every school so I can‚Äôt really say this with certainty."

1079,best ice cream flavor,"I worked at a Coldstone for a few years. Mix cake batter with chocolate ice cream, then add in cookie dough and brownie. Trust me.

Or if you‚Äôre a fruity person take cake batter, yellow cake, whipped cream and strawberries. Strawberry shortcake ice cream.

I could go all day."
5501,best home improvement store,"Wholesalers often make cash sales to the public at significant savings. For instance, I only buy screws from a fastener supply place, because their price is usually about 1/3 the retail price.
