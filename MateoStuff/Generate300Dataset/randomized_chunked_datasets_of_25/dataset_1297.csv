16671,"If your cat doesn't come back, but you're still ok with having a cat at some point, you can get one as a kitten and never let it outside. Most of the time, a cat raised only indoors is pretty afraid to go outside. It's the indoor/outdoor ones that grew up that way that have the biggest problem with it. 

I can't really think of anything that doesn't ""bite hard"". Any pet type creature that isn't a fish is going to be able to bite enough to defend itself if it feels it needs to. 

Having been an owner myself, I'd go with rats. Hamsters are bastards through and through, I'll never be convinced otherwise. Rats are wonderfully intelligent, emotional, social creatures that can be quite a bit like little dogs. You can teach them tricks, they can learn their names, they can be somewhat litter trained. Get some babies from a local breeder of pet rats, not a pet store or feeder breeder so you get the best start possible (you *have* to have more than one, they require at least one rat friend or you have a depressed rodent. Luckily two or three isn't any harder than taking care of one.). The worst thing about them is that they only live for about 2 years, and in that amount of time you will fall hopelessly in love with them, and they will break your heart to little bits when they go.",best pet for toddlers
