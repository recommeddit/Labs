73536,best battery bank,"Considering the fire hazards of poorly designed lithium batteries, I would not get a battery pack not made by an established company: Anker, Mophie. Asus, Xiaomi, Energizer and so on.

Also, do not buy from Amazon as they have a big counterfeiting problem and doing almost nothing to combat it."
19423,best YouTube video,"How is nobody talking about Chris Morocco!?

I love watching him try to reconstruct food after just a brief, blindfolded inspection. The way he uses his senses and categorises everything fascinates me, I love his quirks.

Overall they captured lightning in a bottle with the lineup they have there - every one of them is a likable, kooky, larger than life character! It's like a sitcom cast, but they're real chefs."

26900,best board games,Counterpoint: But some of us out there do play the heck out of some of these giants. Myself I am trying to schedule my 30th play of TI4 hopefully before PoK is released. I would hazard to guess a lot of these are rated highly because for many folks they are the grail game(s) in their collection. God knows TI4 does it for me in a way no other can.
54825,best water filter,"I'm not sure if Brita filters remove halogen compounds, but the carbon filter improves the taste. 

Brita is a decent filter, but you have to keep in mind that it removes suspended solids. This includes calcium or iron buildups and particles that broke off from the inside of the pipes. Brita filter do NOT remove suspended solids. Intertron's test backs this up. Dissolved solids include dissolved organics, halogens, and Ca and Mg (""hardness"", though Brita has ion exchange resins that treat this to an extent).

I don't think it's a bad idea to filter your water. The benefits are marginal, but if you like the taste and don't mind spending the money then have at it.

If you are concerned with halogen content, then you should invest in an RO unit."

8996,best toothpaste,"Might be. Unfortunately I can't find a clear answer on that.

There are however examples of people suffering brain damage because their kidney's where unable to dispose of fluoride which resulted into a buildup on the long term.

My point is that it is definitely safer to spit out toothpaste. It was never designed to be consumed and it could be dangerous. Although clearly you are not in any immediate danger if you do so, otherwise a lot of people would be in trouble already."
