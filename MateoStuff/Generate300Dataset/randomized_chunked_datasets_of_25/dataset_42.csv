3590,"Check out this [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_I_university) from Wikipedia. It is a separate classification system than the one that US News has. 

I heard of additional criteria of becoming an R1 school, such as being a member of the [Association of Research Libraries](http://www.arl.org/about). If you look on the list of libraries, it is likely that the school is also R1. This website is also really great because you can look up statistics about the schools related to their libraries. For example, how many journal subscriptions they maintain and such. It is important to consider this because it means the more subscriptions they have, the less likely it is that you have to pay for an article or subscription on your own.

Other characteristics of an R1 school include accessibility of research opportunities to undergraduate students.

I haven't heard of any category less than R1, although that isn't to say that it doesn't exist.",best college for research
