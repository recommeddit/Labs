67603,axios alternatives reddit,When is a bundle size too big? Honest question. I can’t really find a straight forward answer on that on the “Googles”. I’ve worked on one project where the bundle was 4 MB and didn’t notice any performance issue unless we tested Chrome in Slow 3G configuration.

53999,best medicine for a cold,"I'm betting that the orange juice is for the vitamin C. Just take it in tablet form, I find the orange flavoured chewy ones to be quite pleasant.

3590,best college for research,"Check out this [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_I_university) from Wikipedia. It is a separate classification system than the one that US News has. 

I heard of additional criteria of becoming an R1 school, such as being a member of the [Association of Research Libraries](http://www.arl.org/about). If you look on the list of libraries, it is likely that the school is also R1. This website is also really great because you can look up statistics about the schools related to their libraries. For example, how many journal subscriptions they maintain and such. It is important to consider this because it means the more subscriptions they have, the less likely it is that you have to pay for an article or subscription on your own.

Other characteristics of an R1 school include accessibility of research opportunities to undergraduate students.

I haven't heard of any category less than R1, although that isn't to say that it doesn't exist."

19518,best YouTube video,Ask a Mortician- Caitlin Doughty is a US based mortician all about breaking  taboos and getting us all talking about death. Wonderfully macabre without really being too morbid. She's written a couple of books since and I'm an absolute fan girl.
2829,best headphones,"The average wireless gaming headset battery life is like 10-20.

The only thing that comes close to Bluetooth battery life is the gsp370. Which is closer to 100hours 

Wireless gaming headsets are Rf not Bluetooth.

Wireless headphones are Bluetooth. Often called headsets but that's just because they have a built in call grade mic. Not good for gaming. Bad mic quality and too high of latency."
