**People need to take this seriously**

Libgen is great for searching and if you use the word **review** in your search you will greatly limit the super specific links from your search, and get a start on an overview.

Thanks for the reminder.

edit, also because you are in the science fields you can see the limitations of the ""quick advice"" for the uninitiated.

I did most of my actual lab research in the [pharmacology department at Dal University](https://www.dal.ca/search.html?stype=main&_charset_=UTF-8&q=pharmacology) back in the '80s but I am no longer current."
3292,best webcamera,"I get this & agree things should be added over time. The top end pc part may be useful *IF you are streaming pc games. Streaming can be very CPU intensive & may require the use of some GPU as well. If you're trying to play a new pc game at above minimal settings it may not work. Then you're stuck with a used $300 dust collector. 

I no longer stream, but when I did I has gone with the minimal, had a 720p cap card which I regretted a month in because this meant I had to play my games in 720 not 1080. So I upgraded to a HD60 & enjoyed that, but I had a ps4 pro & 4k monitor. While I didn't care about streaming in 4k the cap card wouldn't push 4k through to the display because it wasn't HDMI 2.1."
73870,best matte screen protector for ipad,"A matte screen protector will wear down your apple pencil tip, how quickly will depend on how much you use it. The most common matte screen protector is the Paperlike brand screen protector. I've never used it myself but I've heard the new version of it is easily scratched and wears down the apple pencil tip quickly. Again, I've never tried it but if you consider it be sure to check out the reviews. A matte screen protector decreases glare, prevents fingerprints, and makes writing and drawing easier. I have this one from Amazon: [Xiron Paperlike Screen Protecor](https://www.amazon.com/Paperlike-Protector-XIRON-Sensitivity-Protector，Compatible/dp/B07NJZB555) They make a 11"" and 12.9"" version. I have not tried this one yet because I haven't gotten my iPad yet but I want a matte screen protector because I will be using my iPad for notes and drawing as well. I didn't want to drop a ton of money on the Paperlike brand matte screen protector since I was uncomfortable with the recent reviews on it. 

A glass screen protector shouldn't wear down your apple pencil tip since it's smooth like the iPad screen. If it does, it wouldn't be as quick as a matte screen protector. Of course glass has more glare and fingerprints. I don't have any to recommend because I haven't looked into those. Some people like the feeling of drawing/writing on a smooth screen. So you may want to try drawing on the iPad first before buying either one to see of you like the smooth feeling or not. 

Hopefully this helps!"

7347,best laptop for general use,"I need a new laptop for casual use. Things like running DnD campaigns, making DnD maps, general web surfing, light Office work in Word and Excel, and things like that. I really want to make sure that is is reliable and fast. I'd like to be able to upgrade it if I need to. I know very little about the technical side of laptops other than that newer generations are better than higher numbers when it comes to processing, and SSD is better that HHD (I don't know what this actually means). I'm not super concerned with graphics cards as I won't be doing any serious gaming on it, but I'd like to be able to upgrade eventually if possible.

I was looking at the HP ENVY x360 because I thought the 2 in 1 would be useful during DnD campaigns and the pen would make drawing maps easier. It also seems to have good options for memory (16gb). Do you think this would be overkill for my needs? Also, does it have the ability to upgrade its memory and storage after the fact to save some money initially?

I'd like to stay generally around the $700 region, but would go up to $1000 if its going to be worth it and the laptop will be relatively ""future proof."" I'm wary of unknown brands, but I'd trust your opinion, given your wealth of knowledge on the subject.

If you could give me your opinion, or some better options based on my needs, I'd really appreciate it."

31855,best hotel to live in,"Here are the hotels I’ve stayed at, in the order I’d rank them (without considering express):

1) Hard Rock - proximity to the parks is awesome. Nice rooms, hotel doesn’t feel huge and very easy to navigate.

2) Cabana - Love the vibe here more than any other hotel. If the hotel footprint weren’t so huge it would probably be my number 1.

3) Portofino - I’d argue the best theming of any hotel. It really does feel like you’re in another country standing on your balcony overlooking the bay. Much longer walk to the parks than the other big two hotels.

4) Sapphire - I know people love it here, but it was just ok for me. Given that it’s the most expensive non-express hotel, I’d rather just go with a value resort and maximize savings or spend more on a premier hotel. Most crowded water taxis since other non-water taxi hotels walk over and use theirs.

5) Surfside - last in my rankings of the hotels I’ve stayed at, but not bad at all. Stayed here with five other adults in a 2 BR and it was very comfortable, nice and clean. Would recommend if you wanted to maximize savings."

64806,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Sure! Is there any specific food your group is looking for or restaurant that are good for groups and kids?  Here are some, Super Cucas, Rustys Pizza, * Cuernavaca, The Habit, On The Alley (harbor), Daves Dog on Hollister ( the cart is temporarily closed), Paesanos on the mesa and to finish it off you got blenders. 

*ps. If you to Cuernavaca order alambres/fortachon or the other three plates under that one. Its da best. And if you are getting tacos pimp them out with onions, cilantro, salsa and radish, lemons and chile carrot vinaigrette on the side. Don't leave those poor tacos naked. Gorditas de tinga or chicharron de salsa verde are to die for... ok im done. Enjoy!"
