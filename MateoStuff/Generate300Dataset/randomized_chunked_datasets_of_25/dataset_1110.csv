65463,best phone service company,"You did a great job in chart that have a lot of valuable information. It is understandable that you might be missing information, for that reason I have some recommendations that will improve the list. 

I will consider the redpocket annual plan it will be a big plus for anyone looking to save.

I will agree with other comments that mentioned that Teltik needs to be the top list, and also to add the Visible Party promotion ($25/month)

Also it will be good to have another field that shows if the price is plus taxes or everything included. So that $25 plan can be $30 depending in your local taxes and fees.

Thank you"
48331,best color to paint with,"Yea SW biggest advantage over other brands is convenience.  

For contractors, They do have some really good products for really competitive pricing(you have to buy a bunch tho).  

For consumers, they have great sales pricing during all major holidays , esp spring and summer.

Ben Moore however, is proud of their product!  The only break you get is in your wallet"
36152,best alcoholic drink,You can also make a Boulevardier (pronounced bool-eh-vard-ee-AY in the French fashion) by replacing the gin with Bourbon. Although I prefer to replace the gin with rye whiskey myself. I just call it a rye negroni to avoid confusion.

12199,best gifts for dad,"my parents generally did tell me if they couldn't afford stuff, but i think on this occasion they didn't realise that what they had bought wasn't the same as what I'd asked for - to them there was no difference, and it was cheaper. That's why I felt bad later on - even when i was young (think I'd have been 8 or 9 for this) I was aware that we didn't have as much as other families. e.g. all my friends would go on holiday somewhere, and we never did. 

Plus, I'm sure telling your child that you can't do something for them is a bit of a downer (I don't have kids myself). There were times when things were made apparent simply because there was no alternative (when I was 13 there was a school trip to Egypt and there was no way they could've afforded that)."

38230,best newspapers to read,"The problem I find with this idea is that the left-right balance isn't just about *how* stories get reported; it's about *which* stories get reported, and which details get included. You don't have to lie or be opinionated to slant the news; you just have to have a slant in deciding what to tell in your truthful, unbiased manner."

41967,movies like Inception,Obvious top post.  I remember seeing this in the cinema and feeling those uneasy chills as she approached the second gyrosphere which was on some secluded beachside on the other side of world.   What an incredible scene.   The tension as she gets in that pod and makes her final attempt is unreal.
