8826,"Hygienist—Paradontax  isn’t special.  It’s active ingredient is Stannous fluoride, which is beneficial because it not only prevents decay, but it is also bacteriocidal, meaning it kills bacteria, unlike sodium fluoride which does not. Crests Pro Health formula and several other brand name formulas are the exact same thing.  The downside of stannous fluoride is that it is very irritating to the gums long term.  It has been available for years in prescription rinses for people who have had oral surgeries to keep bacteria levels down so they can heal faster.  Only in the last several years did it pop up in OTC toothpastes.  Be warned that if your gums start burning and sloughing and you are using a formula containing stannous fluoride, you should discontinue use and switch to one with sodium fluoride.",best toothpaste
