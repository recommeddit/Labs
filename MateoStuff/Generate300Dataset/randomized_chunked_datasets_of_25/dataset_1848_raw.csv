"Hi, are you looking for a gaming laptop or a general use laptop?"
I just use the stock iOS calendar app. What can google calendar do that this can’t do? I’m wondering if it’s worth the change

"I'd like to point out a few things.

Getting a 144hz panel definitely makes sense even if you can barely do 60FPS in games, because the high refresh rate makes tearing less noticeable. I am now without a GPU so I'm trying out games on my iGPU, which rarely pushes above 60FPS in anything from the previous decade. And I have to note that I'm not noticing any tearing in these games. If you want to lock your framerate, with a 60hz panel you can only chose 20, 30 and 60FPS. With a 144 hz panel, you can lock at 24, 36, 48 and 72 FPS without changing the refresh rate of the panel.

It's worth saying that some 144hz monitors will have higher pixel response times when they're running at lower refresh rates. So if that applies to your model and you're running a game at something like 60FPS, you really want to run that game without adaptive sync unless it's causing issues.

When buying a monitor for gaming, always check the reviews (actual reviews that test the monitor, not just user reviews that talk about the experience and parameters). Overdrive in particular should be of interest to gamers. LCD pixels have to physically move in order to change their brightness (that's why they have response times). Overdrive does what the word implies, it pushes more current into the pixels, forcing them to move faster. The problem is that you can actually have too much overdrive - this is called overshooting and what happens is that the pixel moves further than it should and it then has to move back. The result is reverse ghosting, which (at least for me personally) is far worse than ghosting. That's why the highest overdrive setting isn't always the best (in fact, it almost never is).

Although expensive monitors can have the exact same panel as a cheaper one, the truth is that two panels of the same model don't necessarily have to be identical. This is especially true with very cheap monitors.  LCD panels aren't made individually, they're cut from a larger panel. Each panel is then inspected and rated for it's quality. Depending on the quality, the panel will either go into the more expensive or the cheaper model. So it's not that the manufacturer is purposefully limiting the cheaper monitor, they're using a panel that wouldn't pass the quality control of the expensive model. That's why professional monitors are so expensive - the panels that go inside them are cherry picked."
It also has a few kernel and firmware patches to exploit hardware capabilities better.

"Does anyone else have to click the cover art for it to come up and then have to click again to see the song information?

Edit: Fuck this. Why isn't it just a list?"
"I am a huge sunglasses lover, have a wide sunglasses collection and aviators do look weird on me as well. I love the cat-eye shape, it's a bit retro but also very modern and you can find many sunglasses on sale with that shape. I usually buy from big online website and try to find my favorite shape among the sales section. Good luck !"
"Arch, simply because it has the best wiki *by far* and it is a good learning experience. Well, if you want to really get into the details, try Gentoo. For everything else than a learning experience I'd had said Debian."

"That is correct. Check out the WGU sub if you haven’t already. I’m doing my MBA through them, and highly recommend it."
"I will read the dreadful, yet free Metro if I'm commuting into London, and I may read the Observer if I've got a long journey on a Sunday, but that apart paying for the privilege of reading news I've already consumed the night before doesn't appeal to me"

"I am not a dentist, but I have something to say about toothpaste.

APPARENTLY, if you suffer from canker sores, there's something in almost all toothpastes (but not all) that makes them waaaay more likely to occur. It's not even an active ingredient, it's [just the stuff that makes it foamy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_lauryl_sulfate#Aphthous_ulcers).

"I ordered a Ringke Onyx case for my 11. I really like it, I  guess it’s a bit hard to judge without a phone in it but it squares off the sides a bit and seems comfortable. 

iPhone 11 seems like a great size though. Excited for my mint green!!"
I grabbed my wife's Wayfarers to remind myself what they're like now and you nailed it with the roadside vendor comparison. They just feel cheap.

The culture spots like Hollywood and SF are sorta cool, but the parks are the thing that'll blow your mind. Sequoia Nat. Park, the NorCal redwoods, Yosemite, and really all of the Sierra Nevada are the things that will blow your mind."
