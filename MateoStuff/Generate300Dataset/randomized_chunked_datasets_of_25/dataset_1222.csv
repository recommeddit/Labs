41212,best instrument to play,"The autoharp. It has push buttons for the chords and there are different strumming patterns/rhythms you can learn and it sounds lovely. Extremely portable and it is sturdy as well. Buy ""Beginning Autoharp Instruction Book"" by Bonnie Phipps on amazon and it will get you playing right away. I know this because I did all of this myself. Perfect for celtic and folk as well. There is also a late 60s band that uses autoharp and it sounds really cool :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_JJJL4Dm-o"
33601,best electric car,"Your estimated range daily is pretty small. Idk what your weather is like, but you could consider a spark ev, Fiat 500e, etc. They're often sub $10k (got my 2013 500e for $6.5k at 22k miles). They'll charge off a standard 110v outlet as long as it's at least 15A (most are). I've never ran mine so low that it didn't have enough charge to cover my next day. However, a full charge is around 23 hours. I think the 2017 leaf has 150 mile range and would be cheaper than a bolt."
