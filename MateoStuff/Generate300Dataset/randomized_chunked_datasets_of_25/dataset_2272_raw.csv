"Definitely the XF270HUA (assuming it's the AHVA model). 

The G-Sync equivalents (PG279Q﻿, XB271HUA﻿) are almost €300 more, and the TN options are grossly overpriced (S2719DGF, HP Omen 27, XB271HAU, AG271QX).

While the TN options might be marginally faster, they are pretty mediocre (Omen 27, BX271HAU, AG271QX) or overpriced (S2719DGF), and the XF270UA will be almost as fast while having far better image quality.

The C27HG70 will be the fundamentally slowest option, though having the best contrast ratio."
Haven’t confirmed wallet compatibility as this is going to be my first MagSafe phone. But I’m getting the Spigen wallet anyway so hopefully it works well with the Nomad case.

Don't they vibrate back and forth?
"This is a good point. I was going to say that you'd also benefit from buying new in terms of rebates and other EV purchase  incentives,  but looking into it it seems TX does not allow Tesla to get rebates due to being a direct sales company vs an in-state dealership :("
"I dont know if they are country wide or just local to my state, but I have Skullcandy ear buds. They are phenomenal. The pair I usually buy are around 25 bucks(depending), sound amazing and can take a beating. I have washed them, dunked them in water and Mt Dew, put them through some touch conditions. I dont think I have ever had a pair short out on me and the only time they have ever broken was when they got caught in my door and snapped. I seriously cant praise them enough. The best part is, they come with a manufactures warranty that if something does happen to them, you can send them in and exchange them. At least that is how they were. I have never had to, so I dont know if they do it anymore or not."
Can you train it with a mask on?
"I usually portion it out and just keep them in the fridge, then microwave it in the morning. I’m sure it would work well if you kept it in the pan too. I keep the portions either in Tupperware or in plastic bags, depending on how much space I have in my fridge. 

I have seen videos of people pre-making breakfast sandwiches with eggs, freezing them in parchment, and microwaving them in a damp paper towel or something like that but that’s too complicated for me so I just stick with the fridge. Hope this helps!"
I love how innocent Murr is... like he loses so much because he can't be mean or rude at times.
"Yeah that's a good calculator. If you're allowed to use a graphing calculator like a TI-83 or TI-84, then get one of those, but otherwise a TI-30X is fine. I've gone through a whole math degree with just one of those."
"My dad always vandalizes cards. One year for my birthday he thought it would be funny to get a card with a Menorah on it and turn the ""happy Hanukkah"" into a ""happy birthday"" with a big sharpie. Then he writes something offensive on the inside and signs it LYMI (love you, mean it). I still have every single card he's ever given me. I'm going to keep them forever."

"If you're in Pittsburgh, RIDE THE INCLINE. It's one of our oldest attractions, and gives a pretty sweet view of everything. Also check out the view from Mount Washington (but don't go too far into mt Washington it's kinda ghetto)."
"Naw, I dropped out and I have take administration tests in the past where they said I wouldn't need any English/Math classes I just never went further in the process."
"Eh, it works for me sometimes. Spider powers would probably help though."
Exactly. True hydrohomies never buy bottled water except when absolutely necessary

"So you're the fucking kid who makes Tootsie pops appear every halloween? 

If I wanted chocolate, I'd get a tootsie roll by itself. Don't make me fucking eat some delicious fruity candy just to have it ruined by the taste of chocolate. Fruit and chocolate sucks."
"No problem! And just an FYI: if you're a student, they often have student discounts for reasonable prices. When I was subscribed it was through a student discount. I had print and digital access and it wasn't crazy expensive. I'm not sure what they're currently charging, though.

EDIT: if you're a student, you might want to check out the link below before paying for a subscription. Some universities offer all their students access to the WSJ website.

"Wonderoud is smoother and less bitter than Wonderwood.  Funny because I thought I would prefer the oud-less version, but perhaps as you said Wonderoud doesn't actually have real oud."
