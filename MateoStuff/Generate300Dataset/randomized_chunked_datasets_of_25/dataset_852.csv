37608,Ultron is one of the best villains Marvel has but yet and still in this movie they have turn him into a fucking comedian and not a funny one. Also the pacing in this film is fucking horrible there's is too many sections in this film where the movie just stops in its tracks. Age of Ultron never flows fluently is it jumps around. Quicksilver one of the first  Avengers in the comics gets killed off before they even get a chance to flesh out his character so there is no meaning to his death because we the audience don't even get to understand the character. And last but not least Black Widow and the Hulk possibly the worst romance in the MCU. Who would ever thought Black Widow would want to fuck the Hulk. This movie is the worst Avengers movie by far and also one of the worst MCU movies in my opinion.,best Marvel movie

3545,"For researching colleges, I would recommend finding the differences within the ""basic differences"". like you said most schools can end up sounding really similar so here are some ways I guaged whether I would actually like it there (and depending on who you are, these might be differently prioritized for you):

1. Size: often low student-to-faculty ratio is paraded as this magic number, implying a high level of support but it just measures the number (not how it plays out). I would look into the average class sizes—do you want class sizes to be small and intimate, or do you not mind having large lectures?

2. Undergraduate Support: I think this would be less important for some, but how accessible are opportunities for undergrads? Would you be competing with graduate students? Do you mind mainly being taught by teacher assistants (usually graduates, more likely to occur in a bigger school), or would you prefer to be taught by professors (a staple of a smaller school)?

3. Campus setting!! A lot of people already mentioned weather, but I would also say considering the setting as in whether it's rural, suburban, or urban can play a big part in how much you would enjoy the school. It could also factor in the opportunities available e.g. if you're in a big city, you may have more opportunities BUT are you someone that doesn't really like the hustle and bustle of the city-scene? In more regards to unis, large urban areas can be more isolating OR have a more thriving social scene—in this case you'd have to research how current students would describe it.

4. Campus Culture!! (The vibes - I liked watching YouTube Day in the Life for this one too) This is a huge one in my opinion. This is solely based on your priorities and how you wanna spend the next ~4 years of your life. How many of the students are involved in greek life? Is there big party culture? How are sports prioritized? I think each of these have implications of their own. For instance, Dartmouth has an extremely high student participation rate in greek life compared to other Ivies and that has often been associated with increased rape culture, ""fratty"" culture, and negative implications of forming those social hierarchies. BUT   if you would like a party scene, then it's up to you! 

5. Diversity: this may be just because I grew up abroad, but I prioritized more diverse schools. You can find the diversity statistics of each school if you're interested. 

6. Clubs and strength of the programs you're interested in. Also, simply if they even have the program you want (you'd be surprised how many people apply to schools that don't even have their preferred major)

7. Price and how they expect you to pay or offer financial aid: is it loan-based, do they have merit-based scholarships, do they meet full demonstrated need etc.?

8. Do you want liberal arts education? What kind of curriculum do you like? 

Also, of course you may not know what your exact preferences are yet, but this could be a good start to research universities! Like some others mentioned, Reddit and Quora threads were a nice way to find more genuine opinions!

If you want to find more universities you like, you can
put in parameters you like and explore the results and also find out what the universities you like consider important/not important: https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-search

However, we got to put a drawing between the plastic and the padding so I made some crude drawing of my dad as a super hero called super dad (creative genuis, I know. RIP my theater degree sorry dad) and while it used to be his work mouse pad, it now resides in our den for my parents computer. Now he's not super tech savvy so he doesn't use the computer a lot but my mom gets a lot of use from it, so if say it turned out okay.

Unless you're applying to a social media company, it's unnecessary to have them, and it'd be a red flag to me personally if a company demanded I have one. If you're applying to Twitter, obviously they probably expect you to use Twitter.

The only social media I use regularly is Snapchat and LinkedIn, and I've never had trouble finding jobs.
