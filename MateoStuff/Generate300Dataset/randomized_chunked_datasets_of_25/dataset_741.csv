33854,best Pokemon game,"Personally it has to be Emerald, currently imo it has the best rival gang fight that makes sense. Magma wants Groudon aqua wants kyogre.
Both gangs achieve their desired achievements, something other generation gangs can’t say.
And unlike a some what mediocre plot to stop the bad guy ( platinum was just garitina coming out of no where) (6 was basically hey u broke in take this legendary) , u has to go all the way to sky pillar wake rayquaza and stop the madness that took place in hoen.
Not only that there was a refreshing after game. And I mean extremely, the fact that safari zone expanded to include gen 2 Pokémon and the fact you can do the battle frontier , and the grand Mac daddy fight of  stone the elite champion. 
Other generations can’t compare gen 2 Crystal is the closet imo with the fact that you can go both lanzo johto and follow suicine.
