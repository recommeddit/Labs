"Can't say for sure how Cal State degrees fare in the east, but I do see a trend where pedigree is becoming less of an issue due to an oversupply of people with graduate degrees.
  
What I would suggest is that you stalk the companies where you think you might get hired and look at key players in that company and see where they hold degrees. If you see a particular concentration, you might be better served getting your degree from a college in that range.

While it may not be the best option for everyone, you can do the degree online and maybe even save money. Most major universities have online business/MBA degrees. Check out this list:

I woke up this morning with a raging Euphemism.
"I am pretty confident you can do both. (: Jokes aside, I am not searching for a ""holy bible"", more like some recommendations for my next readings."
"I live about 10 miles from Santa Claus, Indiana. Can confirm it's like constant Christmas, but then you can go to French Lick's casino and feel like you're in LA. Even better if you end your night with a trip to the Chicago's in French Lick, and go home to Ireland."
That’s annoying because AD has been Peterson since before Donald was in the league
She got laid
"Montana and Brady are very similar.  Obviously Brady directly benefits from new rules and more passing.  Both benefit from having the best coach of their era (and its not even close), one who revolutionized NFL offenses and another who attacks weakness like probably no other in history.  It's real hard to compare them because Montana definitely has more clutch moments of his own, where Brady I don't think won a single Super Bowl with a clutch play, but that's not a knock on him just saying the highlights are defensive ones or a field goal late.  I'd argue the NFC of the 80's was more of a rough ride than the AFC of the 2000's as well, Manning and Steelers (And sometimes Ravens) aside."
"And removing plaque, mmhmmmmmmmm"
"They way he talks about how different he is from other actors, the way he presents. 


Also have searched on interviews about him because he’s regarded as one of the great actors (I do believe that) but he talks about cinema, filmmaking or etc. it’s always about me me me"
"so sad counterpart did not get a third season. i love the sci-fi aspect of the split world. plus the history teacher loves the whole allegory for cold war that was present. this needs to continue. also J.K. Simmons is AWESOME in the dual role!!!!! he, somehow, physically caries himself differently in each character. just amazing!!!"
I was thinking about getting the HP Pavilion Gaming 15. I was looking in the $500-$800 range for something that could do some gaming. It usually goes between $700 to $750ish. Would you recommend something else over that?
And airline tickets. Avoid Spirit & Frontier
"Just curoius; what genre are the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series then? The characters are set like the Witcher or Horizon, with little room to 'role play' . Are they not RPGs?"
Fire Red
"I love all 3.

Someone else criticized the list because they thought Haruhi was too high.  I guess it's impossible to please everyone."
Cleanflix had a twist at the end
"Nah, some do each separately and then add them up to generate a research score. Heavily cited stuff is awesome, but garbage is also counted."
"1. Tesla: TSLA 

Because they continue to execute and innovate. A few wildcards could make them take off even further, but their brand and core businesses is in a league of its own.

2. Taiwan Semiconductor: TSM

I could have put NVDA here which I own too, but I believe TSM has a more general role. They also pay a nice dividend and chips will be even more important in the future than they already are.

3. CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)

Likely the riskiest stock I own but if things work out it wil change the world.

4. Unity (U}

Almost all games for mobile are made in Unity. Tons of other games too. Unity is becoming a more general tool for all things visual and 3D. Super important for AR/VR and metaverse.

5. Xiaomi (1810)

Undervalued tech giant because they are Chinese. Not only are they soon #1 in smartphones they also command a huge IoT portfolio and over the long term they can tie in services to this extremely large user base. They are also an EV play now."
"Ah, the long-con gold standard."
"Dedoimedo 2018 Distribution of the Year is MX Linux 17, and v. 18 was released December 20th. Kubuntu 18.04 was Dedoimedo's second choice. MX is also #2 (behind Manjaro) on Distrowatch. 

Medium in weight, very beginner friendly, absolutely deserves a look."
"The priciest standard room (for the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo for example, their cheapest room is the Deluxe Room (going for ~70,000 yen per night), their best room is the Mandarin Grand Room - going for ~85,000 yen per night), so I paid 80% of ~85,000 (the actual rate varied per day) to stay in an Executive Suite (which normally runs ~135,000 yen per night).  Not cheap, but great value in my opinion."

"Caje is doing cocktails at night! The cocktail bar is called Lab Social and they block off the front door, play silent movies, have electroswing tunes on in the background, and have a pretty decent selection of drinks! Kind of a speakeasy vibe, though the nighttime entrance isn't too hard to find ;)"
