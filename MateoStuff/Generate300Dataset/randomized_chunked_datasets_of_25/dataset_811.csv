542,"What system/device are you using? That sounds like the screen doesn't detect your pen lift-off in time (which sometimes happened to me when palm rejection wasn't working properly on my windows tablet, basically forcing me to do a restart).

Since you wrote, I got curious and also gave Xodo another go using a Wacom One with Windows 10: Both the highlight-marker and the colored pens worked flawless for me.

After that I also tried out the pencil annotation function with [Foxit Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxit_Software#Foxit_Reader) (the free version), which worked fine, but I don't really dig their pen-implementation. Seems a tad too basic and clunky for my taste. (It basically shows you the line with a slight delay while you're drawing, then re-draws it completely when you lift off the pen. It works, but feels ""off"".)",best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit
