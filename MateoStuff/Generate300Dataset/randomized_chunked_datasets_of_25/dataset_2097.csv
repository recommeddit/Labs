5100,"Lowes doesn't carry Milwaukee tools soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

&#x200B;

But for real, I go to both for different things, or when there's no preference. Usually HD for tools and construction lumber, Lowes for select lumber and electrical, HD for gardening, and other than that I shop at both for whatever I need. Lowes has a horrible online store and inventory system, so I typically only do online orders through HD.

The milwork person at my local Lowes is MUCH better than Home Depot's. She also gave me contractor pricing on our order which was very nice. Home Depot was a pain in the ass to work with getting our patios doors ordered and successfully delivered.",best home improvement store

67633,"People regularly put Picasso’s artwork on other things (mugs, shirts, webpages, etc.), and make replicas without repercussions. They mix and remaster it in lots of different things. If you don’t like Picasso’s work, don’t use it in your things. Picasso doesn’t need to change the way he paints. It’s the perfect analogy. You have no idea what open source even means.

The ignorance is ironic.",axios alternatives reddit
