8835,best toothpaste,"Brushing well matters much, much more than the toothpaste you use.  Largely the toothpaste's function is as a bit of an abrasive to aid cleaning, to provide flouride and for taste/smell.

I'm sure that if you brushed well never using toothpaste there wouldn't be a huge difference compared to if you used it."

33649,best electric car,They’ve been hyping it up pretty big given that it’s getting a huge range bump. I’m cautiously optimistic but worst comes to worst I’ll just wait a few more years for a Taycan.
5100,best home improvement store,"Lowes doesn't carry Milwaukee tools soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

&#x200B;

But for real, I go to both for different things, or when there's no preference. Usually HD for tools and construction lumber, Lowes for select lumber and electrical, HD for gardening, and other than that I shop at both for whatever I need. Lowes has a horrible online store and inventory system, so I typically only do online orders through HD.

The milwork person at my local Lowes is MUCH better than Home Depot's. She also gave me contractor pricing on our order which was very nice. Home Depot was a pain in the ass to work with getting our patios doors ordered and successfully delivered."

67633,axios alternatives reddit,"People regularly put Picasso’s artwork on other things (mugs, shirts, webpages, etc.), and make replicas without repercussions. They mix and remaster it in lots of different things. If you don’t like Picasso’s work, don’t use it in your things. Picasso doesn’t need to change the way he paints. It’s the perfect analogy. You have no idea what open source even means.

The ignorance is ironic."
