As malcontent suggested below, ""debian for the servers, ubuntu for the desktops.""  The same principle applies here except the fresher distribution is used as the base of the stable and not derived from the development tree of the stable (I know there is more too it than that).",best Linux distro

16729,"Bunnies are great, but your house needs to be really bunny proofed because they will chew any cord they can get their teeth on. It’s also really important that your kids (and adults, too) know proper handling for bunnies because they can very easily break their backs with inappropriate handling, or if they struggle while being held. [The Rabbit House Society](www.rabbit.org) is a great resource for learning all about bun buns.",best pet for toddlers
64059,"ya it's a weird site for sure.  The site started like 6 months ago I'd say and they just started adding like 30 books a day.  

Some days they add nothing especially when it's free.

What's crazy though is the search function is shit on the site so they might have had the books you wanted but you just couldn't search for them...but they for sure don't have a shit ton of stuff.

But if you want to search for a book, you have to search by author and you have to spell it how they spell it exactly or the search will fail.  

They will for instance spell the authors name a certain way for 3 books then a different way for another book so you won't be able to find it.

Thankfully though since I've known about the site since it started, I just go through everything...so I keep track of what book was lasted added so I know where I'm at...at first I downloaded 100's of books, but now it's only like 5-10 every time the site goes free.

But ya, if they ip flag you like they did to me, just save the download link to the books and download them the next few days when it's not free anymore and the links will still work....that is until they decide to clamp down on that.

13318,"Integration with GSheets is just better, the thing is designed to be the middle point between all your processes. And to do that it lets you use a modified version of javascript, and I'd rather use that than VBA every time. The main drawback is that Google Sheets performs bad with large datasets (>50k rows).

API integration, mail reporting, custom input-only forms (with Google Forms or with raw Apps Script and your own html file + css) are a common thing in Google Sheets. If these things aren't complex enough for you, well, I don't know what is.

All of those can technically be done in Excel, but let's be real, have you even tried to connect to a RESP API with VBA? Its documentation is 80% written for C# developers (oh and have fun parsing json files). Meanwhile the Google Apps Script documentation is crystal clear and if something isn't there, you just add a library that does the heavy lifting for you.

Yes, Excel can handle 700k rows of index matches in a fraction of a second, but for a developer and as a integration tool, as a middleground between your processes, as a interconnected *spreadsheet* Google Sheets is better.",best spreadsheet editor
