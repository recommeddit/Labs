40812,best instrument to play,"If his choice of instrument says anything about him, he's surely a master of hoverhand."
40791,best instrument to play,"It's a synthesizer.

Edit: To address OP, if quiet is really important, the strings of an electric quitar can still be heard and can be really annoying to others.  They will be twangy and possibly even a little out of tune, since they will be listening without the mask of gain or other effects you are listening through.  The keyboard will just sound like small clunks, like something rattling softly in a shoebox\( if anything can be heard at all.. \)"

Those are ones I have played. I can't put chrono trigger or neverwinter nights on the list because I currently have saves on them in the making waiting to be played. But ya know MMO games kinda got in the way. Currently playing GW2 and loving it. But thats nu list so far I will probably update it later when I play more single player RPGs."
29010,best calendar tool,"I use Google calendar.  I like having multiple calendars so I can make them different colors and share them with different people (my husband, my son, etc.).  I have about a dozen calendars."
69631,best major to study in college,"My degree was a Bachelor's in Psychology.  I started out in a financial aid position at a for-profit college, but I didn't know that much about for-profit schools at the time.  Did not like it at all.  There was high turnover and they advertised the position with little detail to begin with - so I sort of got into financial aid by accident, but I learned the system, which is fairly complex.  Now I work for a community college system, but it helped me to build the experience with FAFSA at the for-profit school first.  I really don't mind the job now. I am working in a situation where I am separated from the customer service aspect - there was a lot of conflict resolution when I worked directly in the school.    

What was your degree?"

62772,Best Data Science textbook,"Awesome list! I'm a software engineer looking to make the jump over to data science, so I'm just getting my feet wet in this world. Many of these books were already on my radar, and I love your summaries to these!

One question: how much is R favored over Python in practical settings? This is just based off of my own observation, but it seems to me that R is the preferred language for ""pure"" data scientists, while Python is a more sought-after language from hiring managers due to its general adaptability to a variety of software and data engineering tasks. I noticed that Francois Chollett also as a book called  [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1539194430&sr=1-5&keywords=Deep+Learning+with+R) , which looks to have a near identical description as the Deep Learning with R book, and they were released around the same time. I think its the same material just translated for Python, and was more interested in going this route. Thoughts?

64538,Best Nike running shoes,"The Streaks feel a lot more like actual shoes, they're a lot stiffer. When I first switched to the LT3s I felt like I was running in socks, they have a ton more ground feel. 

You can find the 6s [here](http://www.footlocker.com/product/model:260718/sku:31413601/nike-zoom-streak-6-mens/pink/black/?cm=) if you're ok with looking like you stole your girlfriends shoes. I had the bright pink 5s and didn't feel weird about it but I'm not sure about these. I found them on a different site a few days ago but now I can't."
39520,best web browser,"Waterfox is a fork of firefox with delayed updates. I don't know how many XUL add-ons are still maintained.

Palemoon is one of the worsest choices. It has a very small user count so any website could fingerprint it easily by user-agent. Its only use case should be legacy websites"

58429,best cologne,"You'd be better off asking men what works best based on their experience.

With that said, check out Creed colognes.  Yes, they are expensive, but they are also incredibly complex.  I've had women introduce themselves just to ask me what I am wearing.  

You can get sample sizes for a few dollars.
