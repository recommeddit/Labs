I don't even think that it's feasible to search for jobs in react without redux rn.

"Usually, I just structure my directories in a way that I'll know where to find things. But if I really need to search, I'll use find."
"I honestly think Snow Crash is much more relevant than Neuromancer, and Seveneves is a hard recommendation when pitted against Stephenson's other works. Anathem definitely belongs on this list, but I imagine that everyone has something they're irked didn't make the list."
