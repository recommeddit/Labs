53624,best medicine for a cold,"The greatest drug-free solution to stuffed nose: those nasal dilator strips!

They are incredible. Way better than you would ever expect, and the only side effects are possibly irritating your skin (because the nose strip sticks with adhesive tape) and looking funny. 

Next time you’re stuffed up, give them a try.

To clarify: I use them when I sleep because most listed drugs have a negative effect on my sleep. A nose strip and one Benadryl give me a good, restful sleep - way better than more drugs and no nose strip."
