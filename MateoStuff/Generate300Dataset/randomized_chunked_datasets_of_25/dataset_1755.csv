32582,"Agreed. I spent a week at the Radisson resort in Aruba. It was pretty expensive for a Caribbean resort (but Aruba tends to be, in general) and not all-inclusive. 

But, we drank our fill of sugarly umbrella'd drinks and decided we would just have fun, pretend it was all-inclusive, and deal with the bill later. It ended up being about half what we expected. We also walked a block further from the resort than most visitors did, and found amazing restaurants.

Our beach was perfect. White sand, no rocks or seaweed, not over-crowded. The drinks were fast and perfectly delicious every time. The campus was a gorgeous paradise or palm trees, lizards and parrots, with lovely rooms and lit pools for night-swimming.

We walked down the beach to where the all-inclusive resorts that we'd looked at were. For only $500 more we could have had a shitty rocky seaweed filled overcrowded beach. We ended up paying $600 for our nacho and booze tab for the week, plus probably $500 on restaurants we wouldn't have gone to if we'd had all inclusive.

So all in all, we paid about $600 more, but the difference between the resorts was night and day, and we explored the island way more than if we'd felt tied to eat at the resort cause it was paid for already.",best vacation resort

16055,"I've been wearing Ray-ban aviators for years now. They're the only ones I wear these days. I've considered getting another pair of sunglasses in a different style, but I've never been in a rush to. The aviators kinda became my go-to.


Edit: I wear contacts most of the time so I haven't needed to get rx sunglasses. At one point my sister - who also wears contacts - had an eye issue and couldn't wear hers for a while. She got a pair of prescription sunglasses and basically wore those when outside and her regular glasses when inside/when it wasn't sunny. They can make rx lenses for almost any frames provided the lenses are relatively flat.",best sunglasses for fashion
