65846,"The concept of a university system is a bit foreign. Here the entirety of the country's universities bar four or five are all in the same system, organised by a central body but independently ran. In that sense the system would be ALL UK universities, including Imperial, Oxford, UCL, LSE etc.

The term ""public"" has a slightly different meaning here too. The government regulate the universities and their fees etc., but the universities aren't part of the government's assets and the lecturers are private workers.
