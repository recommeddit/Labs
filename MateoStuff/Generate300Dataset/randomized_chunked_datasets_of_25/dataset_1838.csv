1539,best ice cream flavor,"Sorry, I meant PacoJet. It's a commercial ice cream machine that takes canisters of frozen solid base and makes perfectly smooth ice cream. Saves a lot of the fiddling home ice cream makers have to do to get the right balance of water, sugar, ice, fat and air. On the minus side, it'll set you back $4,000."

30399,best Mexican war to study,"The Napoleonic Wars; causes, conduct, and consequences, along with investigation into the major players, technology, and side-theatres of the conflict.  

1793-1815 is a super-interesting time in world history.  Britain's at the top of her game, the French are actually WINNING BATTLES (I cringe saying this), and we've got fucking muskets, rockets, and the goddamn Royal Navy.

I'm a bit of an Anglophile, as all of my grandparents are English-born, and I had an ancestor at Trafalgar.  Therefore, I'm most interested in the Peninsular Wars and the naval theatres.  They're so exciting.  We've got guerilla warfare, spy games, massive stand-up battles, bloody sieges, rogues, heroes, and cowards.  Wellington, Picton, Crauford, Cochrane, and Nelson are all fascinating people to study. 

To a lesser (but still considerable) degree, I've studied the other side.  Massena, Ney, Napoleon (and his slutty wife and crazy brother) are all worth looking up. The Russian, Prussian, and Spanish are all worth looking up.  Portugese were the unsung heroes/whipping boys of the whole mess, and just look up Dancing Billy the Orange for a lesson in bad generalship.

Fictionally, the era is well supported as well.  Most of it is written from a British point of view, however.  Horatio Hornblower is a fantastic naval read, and every one of the titles is good.  So's O'Brien's Jack Aubrey. Both of those series are filled with technical details, interaction with real historical figures, and explanations of the political situations, worked right into the text.

To a lesser degree, we've got Bolitho, Drinkwater, and a slew of others.  Most of these series are ""meh"", and degrade as the series progresses.  

Finally, the elephant in the room:  Bernard Cornwell's captain Richard Sharpe.  His books are the womens' romance novel equivalent of historical fiction.  If you read them, start off with Sharpe's Eagle, and continue in the order they were PUBLISHED, not the order of the series.  His writing is pretty good in the beginning, but after the first 9 or so you start to see that they're formulaic, with shitty supporting characters and predictable endings.  They're what I'd give a 13 year old who wanted to get into reading.  They're fun and visceral to begin with (and do a little teaching), but you don't get much out of them.

If you want a list of non-fiction reads you should be checking out, PM me.  I'd be glad to pass my history-nerd knowledge on to someone."
