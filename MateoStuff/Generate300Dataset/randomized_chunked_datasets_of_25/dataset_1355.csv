22266,best celebrity,"The Birdman looks like he'd be a [huge douche](http://splog.nationallampoon.com/files/2009/05/chris-andersen.jpg) but from everything I've heard about him he's one of the nicest, most respectful players in the NBA.  They did some NBA Insider thing on him once and I was blown away.  I've been a big fan of him ever since, even though I hate the Nuggets."

With a modern liquid-cooled battery (like in the cars you’re looking at), I wouldn’t worry too much about DCFC or the impact of weather. Anecdotally, I have nearly 100 sessions with virtually no degradation. 

The main point is convenience. Having your own outlet removes a major annoyance of car ownership."

34615,best NFL player,"The most important person is the head coach. If we're detracting from Rice for having Hall of Fame QBs for most his career, then you should detract from Brady for having Hall of Fame coaching most of his career

If you're looking at this without a positional bias for QBs, Jerry Rice is the obvious #1 player in NFL history."
