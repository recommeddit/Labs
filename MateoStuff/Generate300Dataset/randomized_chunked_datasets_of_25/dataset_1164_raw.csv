I finally made the decision to do this when I bought the 12 pro gold. Don’t regret it. What’s the point of having this great looking phone just to put it in a case. Gold

"I made this post thinking that it was 100% Khloe, but everyone has brought up really good points! You're right that it depends on the category.

Khloe may seem the most empathetic, but she's also the quickest to lash out. She definitely has anger issues and seems to have this tendency to tear people down when she feels insecure. Kourtney sort of minds her own business but is also the most self-serving IMO. She doesn't really care about other people, and I think the biggest character flaw someone can have is being selfish. Kendall also seems self-centered to me but more in an arrogant way. She really thinks she's the best thing to walk to the earth and is publicly known for being rude and ungrateful. Kim used to be just as egocentric as Kourt and Kendall, but I think she's been humbled over the past few years. Kim has definitely grown a lot as a person, but I still don't think she's very honest. She seems like a snake - I don't really trust what she says. Kourt and Khloe have their faults, but I do think they're honest and I respect that. Kylie is a bit of a mystery to me. She seems, from the outside looking in, to be a sweet-natured girl. But she reminds me of Kim in a lot of ways... especially in not being transparent. Kylie seems to put up this facade, so I don't think anyone really knows who she is. Lastly, you have Kris... who in my opinion is the scum at the bottom of the barrel. Enough said."

Also, another one, the green glass. I love that."
And btw this is the: [Rhinoshield case](http://geni.us/RhinoshieldSolidSuitXs) I am referring to. The brush metal is very nice. It is different from the other series with a clear back.

65g zelios at the moment. Used to use clears but then swapped to zelios. They are nice that they are lighter as the clears were a bit heavy but I did play with them for a year. I really do like the bump though in the zelios. Will be building a 67g zelios build next and try them out.

"No. There’s basically a choice you make right before the very, very, very end. Choose the first one, you get ending C. Then you reload from right before that choice. Choose the other on, and you get ending D. Once you have both C and D, then you get ending E, that’s the true ending and it’ll just play automatically for you when you unlock it. You don’t have to replay vast sections of an identical experience, they make it work."
"Surely this is going to be a lovely thread that applies a well studied learning of political science and history to give an accurate answer. 

It's so incredibly subjective. You might well ask ""who is your favorite politician?"" because I guarantee there would be little difference in responses.

You see a lot of inaccurate Sanders stuff now, before that was inaccurate Ron Paul stuff, and I'm sure some Ronnie Panders in the future will pick up the mantle. 

I don't think I can give a better answer than ""Not Rod Blagojevich""

The rant has ended, downvote in peace"
"Op, for a person like me who is looking for a laptop for school work (no gaming), if i could only pick one and I had to choose, what would I want to go for: a higher end cpu (ryuzen 7 or i7) or a higher ram (16gb). 

I find it hard to choose, because I don’t understand much, but I’ve been trying to look for a laptop with both features (high cpu and high ram), but they’re way out of my budget. 

I have seen the Lenovo flex and it caught my eye, but it’s 700+ (not $600 as you have listed), but I’m also concerned the ryuzen 5 isn’t enough on it. Again, I don’t understand much about specs here :/  I don’t want lag, and I don’t want to have to replace my laptop in the next 3-4 years due to updates slowing the computer down. 

What do you think?"

">As a side note, if you do see a doctor but worry about antibiotic overprescribing, it can help a lot to mention to your doctor that you'd prefer to avoid antibiotics if possible. Many doctors feel that patients will be upset if they don't get antibiotics, so telling them upfront will take this pressure off and allow them to make a rational decision as to whether you need them or not.

This - I always mention to my doctor and my kids pediatrician that if not necessary, I would prefer to avoid antibiotics.  My dad is one of those people who doesn't feel like the doctor took care of him if he doesn't get a script, and I have tried and tried to explain that many illnesses are viral -  but honestly, the resistance issues scare me."
"LA Times. Sports page every day. **KOBE**. Oh and then I check it for the Fry's ad. Usually I find myself looking at the Calendar section for stuff to do, real estate/home sections for w/e reason, and the Business section for baloney.  
  
Sometimes, I read the political worldly news bullspin stories, just to tell my parents that the shit they read is wrong because al-jazeera says so. o_O"
I bought a wool poncho off a guy from Ecuador for 50$. Friend with me at the time said it was stupid. It's cool looking as hell and keeps me so warm. I've walked through blizzards in that thing and it works great.
"A squirt of fresh lime juice improves most drinks. It's like the salt of drinking. A sprinkle of salt draws out the flavor of food, a squirt of lime draws out the flavor of drinks. If you think your drink is missing something, try squeezing a lime wedge into it.

"A) drink as much water as possible without discomfort
B) gargle very warm saltwater... gotta get it back in the throat
