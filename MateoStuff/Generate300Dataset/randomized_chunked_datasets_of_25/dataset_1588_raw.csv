"ever tried a circle pit simulator? get on the treadmill, blast Lamb of God-Redneck, run as fast as you can and fall down face first every 30 seconds."
"Nemo, Thunar and MC"
I had to watch 30 Rock with subtitles on because there are so many jokes sometimes I would miss stuff.
"Immortal Technique- Revolutionary, Vol 2"
"Dasani. You cannot say otherwise, it's Dasani."
"This is really nice, some of the shots are genuinely interesting, bit overall the film has this lovely cosy feel to it. Like the snow outside would probably have been a more interesting subject but the idea of you thinking up all these faux-arty shots is really nice."
Just looking at photos and seeing if you like it
"I know I'm late to the party but I do hope you checked out Persona 5.  I don't like turn based RPGs, and I'm not a huge anime fan... but Persona 5 is easily one of my favorite games of all time.   and it has a solid 5 star rating with 12k votes on the PlayStation store... that's the highest I've ever seen of any game, period."
"I got into it because of the cost.  I bought a bulk order of Feather razors five years ago for thirty bucks and it's just now running out.  So now that I'm not spending fifteen-twenty bucks a month on cartridges, I can splurge a little on a nice brush and cream.

It's a nice feeling to have a twenty minute block of contemplative time in which you are applying a skill to pamper yourself.  It's almost like meditating and you look better at the end of it."
The $45 plan is actually 25GB per month.
"Various things. My whiskey, preferably. I don't need to adore the window decorations all the time."
"If there's anything that border security on Netflix taught me, it's that this doesn't always work out too great"
"At my Home Depot they offer free water test kits. There is a small tube inside you fill with tap water and mail it off somewhere.

I did it and never heard back, so ymmv lol"
"Or better yet, Abre Los Ojos (not sure if streamable though)"
"Be ready for long hours and lots of stress. A lot of people just look at the glitz and the glamor. They don't take into account getting on set at 6 AM to load in. Or 12 hour days, 6 days a week to film a series, for a month or more at a time. If you're ready for this, be prepared to jump from job to job because a show/film isn't done for years at a time like most jobs."
Final Fantasy 10 remaster
"It's important to note to all who read this **APPLY FOR GLOBAL ENTRY INSTEAD!** the global entry system includes the TSA Pre-check, is just a few dollars more ($100) and the money goes to the customs department **NOT TO THE TSA!** 

Do not support the TSA with Pre-Check, support an arm that actually does some good by getting Global Entry instead!"

"If you come to Maine, I recommend doing so in the fall, when the leaves are changing colors. Hit up Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. Great views, great little tourist town. On the ocean. I cant really describe the with words. I grew up there and now that I'm moving around with the Coast Guard, I still love going back just to see this. Hit it up, you wont regret it."
"> it's liberalism

are complaints by people who've never ventured outside of the SF bay area or LA counties.  upper northern CA and the inland empire are all conservative areas.

in some respects, CA is a miniaturized, very concentrated version of the US."
"And now you have to maintain it, or rather some dude 3 years from now who picks up your project has to maintain it."

"Yes, they will.  The gun has to be in a locked, secure container, but that container doesn't have to be a gun-specific case.  It can be a large lockable suitcase with all your other luggage also secured.  It's a fairly common tactic among security-paranoid travelers to pack a gun in with your other stuff specifically to get the special treatment.

The TSA still opens the bag to confirm the contents, but they do so with you present.  It's then locked with a non-TSA lock and not opened again until you collect it at your destination."
