After insisting it's too much and asking what that cancelation policy is, they surrender to it and end up having an amazing time. 

They spent \~20 years never really going on trips so that I could have an education and career prospects. Makes all the sense in the world to me for me to gift that lost time as much as I can.",best gifts for mom

4135,"I've supervised uniformed personnel for a long time and seen the rise of online programs. Be really careful about online degrees and degree programs. Your best bet is to find a real school, with real grass, and a college football program (bear with me), and then check out their online programs. 

About the college football program: a school that has one has an established grass-brick physical presence. And that's worth $ compared to one run out of a strip mall in Miami. Imagine if you're competing with someone and you have exactly the same skills, but your degree comes from a physically-established program as compared to a pure online school. You'll win the interview. Look at Park U if you need to go online (I'm not affiliated with them in any way) as an example.",best online college
