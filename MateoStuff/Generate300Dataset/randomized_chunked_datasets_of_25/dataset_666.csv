15930,best sunglasses for fashion,"Yes, I do think that between those two the quality of the lenses (how clear they are and how long they last before the coating starts coming off) was worth the price difference, but beyond that the only reason to spend more is if there is a pair that is exactly what you want and anything else wouldn't be quite good enough."
52825,best hiphop album,"Yeah mate I love all three of them, I really rate Ocean Wisdom."
41348,best instrument to play,"heh. No, definitely separately."
12501,best gifts for mom,"My parents have enough THINGS at this point in their lives (I'm in my 30s, they are in their late 60s), so I've been gifting them all expense-paid trips the last few years. After insisting it's too much and asking what that cancelation policy is, they surrender to it and end up having an amazing time. 

They spent \~20 years never really going on trips so that I could have an education and career prospects. Makes all the sense in the world to me for me to gift that lost time as much as I can."
63422,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Key+ is also a good alternative to swipe expander
35452,best alcoholic drink,"My favorite easy summertime drink usually fits this bill, as it's contingent on how heavy you pour.

It's usually just a half can of strong ginger ale (The best is called Northern Neck Ginger Ale, and can usually be found in a small part of Virginia to my knowledge) OR a ginger beer.

1-1/2oz of Bourbon

Sometimes I twist it with whatever bitters I have on hand, so far my favorite is an orange mix by a brand called Wigle."
34951,best NFL player,"Henry better bet top 3 at least after one of the best running back seasons of all time, especially with the decreased focus on the running game in today’s NFL"
4135,best online college,"I've supervised uniformed personnel for a long time and seen the rise of online programs. Be really careful about online degrees and degree programs. Your best bet is to find a real school, with real grass, and a college football program (bear with me), and then check out their online programs. 

About the college football program: a school that has one has an established grass-brick physical presence. And that's worth $ compared to one run out of a strip mall in Miami. Imagine if you're competing with someone and you have exactly the same skills, but your degree comes from a physically-established program as compared to a pure online school. You'll win the interview. Look at Park U if you need to go online (I'm not affiliated with them in any way) as an example."
3736,best college for research,"A place that's good at research is not necessarily good at teaching.

If the goal is to figure out the best place to attend as a student, it's like picking the best place to work based on stock market performance."

51228,best rap album,"Well call me a cheap bullshit poetic but the way Kanye has been these past years it feels in place. The cover art solidifies this to me. You have his come up and childhood gospel roots in ULB for example, but Freestyle 4 is straight cocaine sniffing Lamborghini racing Kanye I can picture at his peak just as well."

34325,best NFL player,I don’t know how anyone gets Robinson over Diggs on any list lol
41745,movies like Inception,"If you get the chance, try to see the Mexican film, The Incident, directed by Isaac Ezban. I just watched it at the Busan International Film Festival, and it definitely blew my mind. Two parallel stories about characters trapped in illogical endless spaces: two brothers and a detective locked in an infinite staircase and a family locked on an infinite road - for a very long time."
