Provided your municipal tap water is decent and not Flint, Michigan quality, it's cleaner than bottled water and is much more strictly regulated.  If you want to bother bottled water snobs, tell them that it contains 1,000 times as much bacteria as tap does.  However that bacteria is a harmless type.  

Generally bottled water is sold as either drinking water, purified water, or mineral-free water.  Most bottled drinking water is purified with activated carbon and then sent through a reverse-osmosis filter.  If that's all that's done, then it can be a substitute for distilled water, but drinking water generally gets mineral added to it because pure water actually tastes bad.  Some bottled drinking water is just municipal tap.  Purified water can be tap sent through activated carbon, and I don't see any purpose to it, which may be why the Krogers around here discontinued it.  Mineral-free water is either treated with reverse osmosis or steam distillation.  

If drinking water is advertised as coming from a mountain spring, it probably does.  I used to live near an Arrowhead water processing plant that was in the middle of a residential area, and tanker trucks would go in and out, and often they'd have a sign on back asking for sources of water.  Arrowhead sold both municipal tap water and mountain spring water.",best water brand

57216,"It is usually the same as tap water. Some waters have a different taste, which is one reason to buy it. I can’t tell most apart, but there is a Scottish brand that I liked. Had a chalky taste to it, that my friends disliked.

Another reason to buy bottled is if your local tap water is unsafe, either from the source or your tap.

Usually, it is better to drink tap water. It is significantly cheaper, and has less of an impact on the environment. Bottled water has led to droughts in some areas with little financial return to that area. 
Personally we filter our tap water because we don’t like the way it tastes, though it is perfectly safe. It also helps remove any dirt in the pipes that may be present.
