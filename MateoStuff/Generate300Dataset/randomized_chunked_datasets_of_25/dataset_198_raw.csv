"I used to be a bellboy so I saw tons of celebs act like complete dicks or really nice people. I once saw William Shatner charge a kid 100$ for an autograph because he was asking outside of the fan expo he was attending and then I heard rumor he was charging $100 inside anyways. Brian Adams treated me like a total pack mule just because he could and had me move 40 pieces of press junket boxes back and forth for a laugh. Terry Crews asked me for a book of matches and tipped me $20 and when I went to explain that it was too much he said he knew what he was giving, laughed and walked away. Gene Simmons had me hold a limo driver for 5 hours (losing other fares during a film festival) and then proceeded to jump in a cab at the door because the limo wouldn't take a horrendously low flat rate essentially fucking myself and the limo for peak tip/fare time. I could go on if you girls/guys are interested."
"If you don't mind japanese RPGs but made for the western audience anyways, I'll suggest you to play Persona 5 Royal and Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Just 2 of my favorites in the last couple of years."
"No he's right, the burden of proof falls on the one making the claim. I too am curious."
"To me, nothing compares with the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen paper on the nature of physical reality and quantum mechanics. It's beautiful for the simplicity of its argument, and it is basically the spawning point for all subsequent work in quantum foundations. It can be found here:

Staying with Einstein, his book on special relativity is extremely intuitive and understandable to anyone, and is definitely worth a read."
You deserve to if you're dumb enough to stand in the arena.
The libraries comment is a good point. Thanks. I've heard that an R1 school may do multiple 100's of millions of dollars in research where an R2 may do 100 million or less in research.
"He wasn't really a deep threat as he wasn't very fast. He was a homerun threat because of his YAC ability no doubt.

>I could go on, but I think the fact that he scored 22 touchdowns in a 12 game season, in an era where the defense was still allowed to stop the pass is more convincing than anything else.

In a strike season where 80% of players didn't cross the picket lines; he didn't go against the same caliber of defenses."
"I've seen Leroy referenced a million times and never saw that video until just now. I'm legit crying with laughter, that was just astonishing"

"Baking soda is abrasive. There's no complicated research behind it, it's just a physical property of baking soda."
"Besides, most taste like crude oil."
"While Im always down for a good stout; avg about 200 cals.

Vodka/water...flavor with your choice of Mio or whatever 0cal flavoring you choose.  Should be about 65cals per oz of vodka, so maybe 130 total if you order a double/tall."
"Wow. Now it's making me contemplate on what I should get for my next fragrance in my line-up. Was thinking of getting Creed Aventus, which will be my biggest buy for a fragrance. But now I'm giving Tygar a consideration."
"That sounds like something interesting a few people would like to read. As someone who visits ADK a few times a year and have gotten to know a few locals, I'd love to read about it. Especially how hiking and climbing kind have affected ADK and if they affect the environment/economy differently from ski folks or non-outdoorsy tourists, if you cover different demographics. 


Please consider posting your thesis to relevant subs when you are done!"
Which toothbrush would you recommend for that?
No he's not. It's watered down typical Ubisoft shit where all the quests are the exact same.

"Personally I don’t like open bottom cases, so I can’t recommend anything."
">It won't remove dissolved inorganic compounds, heavy metals, etc

Yeah, but you usually don't find very high concentrations of *dissolved* heavy metals. Instead, you tend to find them in particulate and colloidal forms, which can indeed be filtered."
