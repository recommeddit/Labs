It's a perfectly fine engine builder game, but with some incredibly glaring flaws. There are just so many other games that deserve it's spot that I can't believe it's so highly considered.",best board games

70484,"I just try to keep a (hopefully somewhat self aware) sense of humor about it. I go to a Catholic University, so when I pull the ol' ""I'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven"" line out, it usually gets a little chuckle. Most people don't think the Catholics appreciate humor, but it's worked for me so far. And if my core friend group gives me a good ribbing, I just quote MSI to them ""I'm gonna conform. I'm gonna play ball. I make a sacrifice, because I want it all ^^awee-oo-weeoo!"" 

And like, yeah, we're not directly curing cancer or anything, but when someone does, how are they going to get their drug to market? Through us. Or people like us, anyway.",best major to study in college

1. Renew for 3 months at $45/mo
2. Renew for 6 months at $35/mo
3. Renew for 12 months at $25/mo

It's possible to continue getting the 12GB/$25 price, so I keep it listed that way in the comparison chart. Similarly, all plans are listed with their auto-pay discounts applied.",best phone service company

8677,"I've heard generations of poor people (e.g. kids, their parents, and grandparents) all say the and thing about brushing their teeth with baking soda. And how much they hate it and often prefer to not brush their teeth at all than use baking soda. So I don't think there's a similarly priced toothpaste or else they would have found it. Baking soda is 89 cents for like an 8 oz carton, which lasts probably 100+ brushes.  I doubt the dollar store toothpaste can compete with that.  But I will look next time I'm there to see if an option exists.",best toothpaste

62749,"I’m not trying to be a Nate Silver apologist but Silver often says the 2012 elections were easy and that he shouldn’t be praised so highly for that prediction since there was so little uncertainty. 538 lacks transparency in its models but they’re driving traffic not publishing. 

And that article jumped on its high horse early on Election Day to say 538’s results were obviously wrong but in retrospect it’s the only model that gave the actual winner a reasonable chance. Maybe it’s not a strictly rigorous model but it worked best in a situation of high uncertainty whereas every other model was over confident in the face of uncertainty.",Best Data Science textbook
