"Dune Coffee Roasters (French Press' new name), Caje, or Low Pigeon are all great."
It's mostly preference. Some folks like the API of Axios more. Both get the job done for most use cases.
I disagree. My mouse broke when i was on my first playthough. I had no choice other than to use controller. And i never felt crippled playing it with a controller. It actually felt smoother
"I echo the Cedar Point vote is you are up for a road trip.

If not, Busch Gardens Williamsburg is the way to go.  They have a really good collection of roller coasters and the park itself is one of the most beautiful parks in the country.

Hersheypark would be a close second for me.  They have a lot deeper collection of roller coasters but to me, they lack the top end quality that BGW has.  They have the quantity though.  They have 7 really good coasters.   It is also a really nice park, but not on the level of BGW.  Throw in the zoo that is attached, and Hersheypark is one of the few parks I could do more than a day at without getting bored."
The vote was split between right Twix and left Twix.
"To Burr and Segura, I would also add Segura's wife Christina P.

 John Mulaney is amazing. 

Burt Kreischer's special is filthy and hilarious.

And, of course, Dave Chappelle!

Edit: everyone already said those."
"I have had a Jansport Airlift since 1999 and I still use it to this day for hauling gear (skating pads, rock climbing gear, day camping).

It even has rubbery, cell-walled material in the shoulder straps that I was convinced would tear apart with repeated use but the shoulder straps are still in amazing condition."
"I bought a 50 ml tester for $7 and I couldn't resist. It smells much more expensive than it is, but the sharp lime opening can be a little off-putting. Loveee the dry down tho"
Which ones do you think is best? BC that's still alot of games to choose from. Want to see if I can narrow it down a little more. Might play all of them at some point I just don't know where to start.
"Yea I know, I was just making a joke lol"
What about Darude Astley- Sandroll? It's awesome!
They are basically the same piece of software but with a few random changes so I would not be surprised in the least if resource utilization is not entirely consistent between machines.
"Sullivan Hardware is pricey but if you need to go in a store where the staff is actually helpful they’re pretty great. 

As other people have said, Menards is awesome too. Every time I go in there it’s shockingly cheap."
"Yep, I have two of these.  They're also overclockable to 76Hz which is nice."
I got my cat for 55$ so that.
Whoops! What did you end up getting?

"NFS 5 Porsche unleashed. Build your way up through Porsche history. Occasional interspersed with some genuinely difficult story missions. The one where you have to get to the train station in 1:15, without a scratch, in random traffic, was particularly brutal. But man when Dieter said there’d be something extra in my cheque, all worth it somehow."
Yea I love living in California ;)
"Current gen consoles were 8 core, but they were 8 core 8 thread and the individual cores were weak, even at the time."
