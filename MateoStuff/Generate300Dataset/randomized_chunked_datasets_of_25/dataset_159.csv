Regardless, this is why most people only update once in a bluemoon, and if they do like to play that game its smart to keep a USB drive with Arch on it so you can chroot, or just make a simple img backup with something like clonezilla.",best Linux distro
12493,"My mom is in her late seventies and despite having a desk top, she is TOTES not computer or tech literate.

I got her an iPad a few years ago and she just LOVES it.  They are so easy to use and intuitive that once we downloaded some games, books, Facebook and got her email set up there she was addicted.  I think she would have refused if I had offered to buy her one, but since it was wrapped up under the tree, she gave it a try and loved it.  This was probably 5 years ago.  I'm considering upgrading her.",best gifts for mom

Not to mention, if you spent all that time learning such a specialized skill that society is in need of, when there is only so many available slots for residencies... probably feel guilty when hanging up your spurs... people that goninto neurosurgery are not the fire type",best major to study in college

14743,"Beautifully written romance books and why I believe they are well written (I couldn’t pick one!)

Radiance by grace draven: talk about a short book that packed a punch.. there was not a sentence wasted in this book, every sentence moved the story forward, the prose was beautiful, and the book left me feeling completely satisfied with the plot.. wouldn’t change a thing. 
(BONUS- also has my favorite sex scene in any book, it really showed the true meaning of “making love”)

The last hour of gann by R lee smith:  very very long but it has incredible world building as the story moved along.  As opposed to a lot of books that take half the book to just describe the world to the reader and then move the story forward, the last hour of gann moves along in a nice pace while giving the reader a feel for the surrounding world matching the plot. For a book this size, it also doesn’t waste a single sentence, and you are left in a daze when completed (the tie in at the end to the 1000 pages of plot.. wow wow wow)
Note: would not recommend this to beginners reader, it is not the most easy read. Midlevel to expert readers rejoice! 

Ps: thanks to this sub I discovered my two all time favorite romance books :)",best romantic novel
