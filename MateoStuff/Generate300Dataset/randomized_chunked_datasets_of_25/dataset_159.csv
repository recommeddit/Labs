56229,best action and adventure movie,"Am I the only one that likes Last Crusade more than Raiders? Love them both, but Crusade just feels a little smoother with better dialogue."
51819,best iphone case,Not a leather case right now. I’m using an Incipio Duo case instead. Kind of thick but it feels nice. I’m waiting to see if a better leather case option comes along.
11515,best gifts for dad,"Ryzen 5950x, cyberpunk 2077, and some time to assemble the PC and play the damn game."
67004,best soccer team in the world,"What exactly is a ""midfield team""....?"
72999,best Linux distro,"Official releases when updated store the older version in /var/cache/pacman/pkg and can simply be downgraded by running pacman -U on the previous version. AUR releases can be managed with software like 'pamac' which also allows downgrades.

Regardless, this is why most people only update once in a bluemoon, and if they do like to play that game its smart to keep a USB drive with Arch on it so you can chroot, or just make a simple img backup with something like clonezilla."
12493,best gifts for mom,"My mom is in her late seventies and despite having a desk top, she is TOTES not computer or tech literate.

I got her an iPad a few years ago and she just LOVES it.  They are so easy to use and intuitive that once we downloaded some games, books, Facebook and got her email set up there she was addicted.  I think she would have refused if I had offered to buy her one, but since it was wrapped up under the tree, she gave it a try and loved it.  This was probably 5 years ago.  I'm considering upgrading her."
12168,best gifts for dad,And how the fuck is a gift card any better than cash? Its like you decided to give me $18.59 instead of $20 and the rest of the money is a gift to target or some bullshit
69788,best major to study in college,"I think the point is that neurosurgery is a terrible way to fire... great way to earn a fuckload of money later in life... but spend your time from age 22 to 35 studying or working 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week? Not to mention, if you spent all that time learning such a specialized skill that society is in need of, when there is only so many available slots for residencies... probably feel guilty when hanging up your spurs... people that goninto neurosurgery are not the fire type"
27826,best breakfast foods,In England we call cookies biscuits. So I thought your breakfast choice involved gravy and cookies with sausage. Which is just odd.
13565,best research paper archive,Bookmark `javascript:location.hostname += '.sci-hub.tw'` and click that bookmark if you're ever on a paywalled article page.
44765,best items under $100,"It's the $400 kettle, $800 in kegs and CO2 tanks, and multiple fridges that realllly extend the ROI on that one.

The plus side, the more I brew the more I save...... right?"
39168,best web browser,"Hey, spdy, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

43747,best items under $100,"Found a 7 year old mastiff on Craigslist for $75. I figured I'd have her for maybe 3 years or so if I was lucky. She made it to 16. She loved people, playing in the leaves, and rolling in the grass. 100% good girl."
35047,best NFL player,"Namath over Montana...crazy talk.

Joe Montana - the perfect winner"
55267,best places to hike in the east coast,Do you prefer one over the others? And do you know anything about the trails in the Catskills? If it's cool to hike them around this time of year?
40453,best midrange GPU,"Unfortunately, the 2060 ko and rx 5700 are slightly over budget for them. Remember, they're Canadian so expect prices to be higher compared to US prices.

All that being said, I'd recommend the 1660 super/ti or 5600 xt at that price range. Thats not accounting for Sales/used prices though."
28273,best breakfast foods,"Eggs (scrambled or over easy), bacon or sausage, and a slice of toast.

Protip, you don't actually need to flip your egg for over easy; just pop a lid on your pan and the top will cook itself."
22476,best celebrity,"Met Superman, Christopher Reeve, (before his accident) at a small town charity function. No entourage, no fancy demands, just a genuine nice guy being the auctioneer at a tiny event In Texas. A swell fellow."
60510,Best comedy show on Netflix,The Office and The Boys - both great!
14743,best romantic novel,"Beautifully written romance books and why I believe they are well written (I couldn’t pick one!)

Radiance by grace draven: talk about a short book that packed a punch.. there was not a sentence wasted in this book, every sentence moved the story forward, the prose was beautiful, and the book left me feeling completely satisfied with the plot.. wouldn’t change a thing. 
(BONUS- also has my favorite sex scene in any book, it really showed the true meaning of “making love”)

The last hour of gann by R lee smith:  very very long but it has incredible world building as the story moved along.  As opposed to a lot of books that take half the book to just describe the world to the reader and then move the story forward, the last hour of gann moves along in a nice pace while giving the reader a feel for the surrounding world matching the plot. For a book this size, it also doesn’t waste a single sentence, and you are left in a daze when completed (the tie in at the end to the 1000 pages of plot.. wow wow wow)
Note: would not recommend this to beginners reader, it is not the most easy read. Midlevel to expert readers rejoice! 

Ps: thanks to this sub I discovered my two all time favorite romance books :)"
42659,best detective show,"Seconding Inspector Lewis, especially since OP mentioned Enveavour."
16554,best pet for toddlers,"Growing up we had 3 cats, a dog, 2 iguanas, a hedgehog, 2 parakeets, 2 snakes, a hamster, a 50 gallon tank and a 20 gallon tank of fish. Everything lived without one killing the other. Although, the cats did try quite often to take out the birds."
