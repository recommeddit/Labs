"Nope, a bit of sore throat should be fine, it has more to do with once you notice it, do something about it.  If your throat is inflamed and miserable, then it is probably too late, but if you get that feeling that you know is going to lead to a sorer throat, then time to spring into action, or rather spring into inaction."
Itâ€™s there I just checked . Also you can find it on BigBoss
Gorgeous! Much love for NYS!

"Brave or Degoogled Chromium, maybe Edge."
Hereâ€™s a real answer! Im a RDH. Thereâ€™s a prescription fluoride toothpaste by 3M called Clinpro5000 (or alternatively prevident by Colgate but Iâ€™m not a huge fan of it) that is super gentle and inoffensive in taste (itâ€™s almost kind of bland)  and has hardly any grit to it so itâ€™s very safe for enamel. Itâ€™s 1% fluoride and not only does it prevent cavities but it will help to prevent recurrent decay around any existing restorations you have and is GREAT for sensitivity. The only con is you do have to buy it from your dental office.
Sorry about that. I linked directly to the artist's page to credit him. Thanks for finding this.
Fuck yeah. That stuff works wonders.

This is because it says on the can not to mix it with other drinks. The bartend passes it to you un-mixed. Its up to you now to do whatever you please.
They're awesome. They're silly and funny and loud and curious and humbling and awesome.

"River is short but amazing... 
Its about a detective who tries to find the murderer of his partner (as in coworker). He has witnessed the murder and is traumatized and has a hard time coping with what happened.

Happy Valley has somewhat the same vibe as broadchurch even though the story is quite different.

If you like Sherlock, you may like Elementary. 

EDIT: Just noticed that you already watched the bridge and broadchurch, so removed those from my recommendations. Loved these series as well :)"
That makes sense. Yeah maybe I can grab a few just for the alphas to test. Theyâ€™re also dropping right now ðŸ¤”. Thanks for your input
"I agree. Nike is good at making racing shoes, I usually run in Brooks Ghost for daily trainers. But man they did a great job with these Pegasus I recommend trying them."
I really enjoyed by Harem which Armandhammer and the Alchemist dropped this year. Incredible lyricism and some experimental production. Falling out of the Sky which features Earl is one of my fav songs of the year!
Iâ€™m more impressed you were in the front row of an Alice Cooper show when you were a kid.
"Best: PokÃ©mon Heartgold, hands down

Why: Fking two regions, a great rival that has developement, awesome music in nearly every screen, an enormous PokÃ©dex where you can link up with 3-4 other games to get the PokÃ©mon you need and enough ""pushes"" too keep your interest in the game.

Worst: PokÃ©mon X/Y and partially PokÃ©mon Sun/Moon

PokÃ©mon X/Y (from what I remember, I borrowed the game); shitty story with forced tear-jerk ending, a weird ""power"" system that made no sense, fucking starter PokÃ©mon thrown your way with no effort and characters where I don't think I even remember the main one.

PokÃ©mon Sun/Moon: Not terrible, but extremly watered down by a mile. It's so bloody easy  to fill the PokÃ©dex (without trading even you get 70%), the liga/competitions are a joke if you are already used to the franchises ins & outs and if I hear Lilly complain ONE GOD DAMN MORE TIME that she wants to become a PokÃ©mon trainer without ever becoming one (which would have been an interesting developement) I'll scream.

However, it has it's peaks though: the islands were new, even though very simple, I loved the variety of the islands competitions (not just; beat trainer up), the crazy characters (Bromley/Guzma & Yasu/Nanu are best <3) and...as dumb as it sounds...I really loved the dress-up feature. Idk why, but I just adore that feaure."
i think so
Same here! Saved me tons of money.
