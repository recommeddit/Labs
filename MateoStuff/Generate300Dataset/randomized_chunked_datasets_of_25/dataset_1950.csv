10587,best suitcase lock,"Um what? Do you not know what baggage claim is? There aren't many people who put locks on bags that they're going to be carrying all the time. They put locks on the ones that will be put into the luggage compartment and they'll have to pick up from baggage claim. That's where the random people will be looking for their bag and then see a bag without a lock and ""check to see it's theirs"" before taking something and putting it back."
71366,best movies with a cool twist,"Hey man! Just watched The guilty! Well it's not on my top 10 list, but damn, I would've never guessed that the mother was the one who killed the baby. I love these kind of plot twists, it gives you the information, and when the twist happens it's like a puzzle. It all makes sense. But you know what could've been an even better twist? If the mother would've left a message before she committed suicide, and the message would say something like that the father was actually the one who killed the baby, but he said he would kill her if she tells it to the police, and just like that, the father gets away. I hope you know what I mean, and thank you for your suggestion, it was a good film! 7/10!"
