Oh boy you’re either trolling or new to Reddit.
"I personally use an Anker powerbank, and it’s been great so far, but one issue of note is that you have to charge it with 5v 2.1 amps or else it charges super slow (like 1-2 days to fully charge)"
Should a library that has a mature API and covers all necessary functionality still be expected to have frequent commits?
"You said ""look around"" and yeah, we're on the Marvel Studios Sub. & What ""Hill"" am I dying on? Geez, why are you so upset by this? You are completely ignoring my point on us in this sub tending to hype things in being top-tier if they're new. 

 No, I don't think you are in a minority if you think this isn't top 5 MCU lol. I think it's fucking great, but I would bet that a majority of people in the long run wouldn't put this over IW, Endgame, Ragnarok, TWS, Civil War, Iron Man, BP, Homecoming or FFH..."
watch season 1 of true detective
"Nice, congrats!"
"Wow, my dentist would have charged me 60 bucks for a consultation of what you just typed. Thanks internet!"
Berkey would be the only buy it for life water filters i would recomend. berkeywater.com/big-berkey-system-2-25-gal/
"Oh, okay. I’m not really sure what app would allow for that, but if you find out, make sure to share!"
"I have yet to go to one of the stranger ice cream places out here. There's one that has candied ginger, which is rather different than just ginger. It has all sorts of strange flavors, though. I'm hoping to get to [Humphry Slocombe](http://www.humphryslocombe.com/Home.html) sometime this month."
"I'm not sure where this is in the 'dacks, but I can confirm that you'll love them when you go.  Get some packable camp gear and get deeper in... my very favorite hike up there is Mt. Haystack (not Haystack Mountain... very different) from the Garden trailhead.  Easily combinable with Marcy, but it'd be tough to car camp that one.  IIRC, just Haystack is an 18-mile r/t, a long day."
I don't think that's true at all. Chicagoans are largely down to earth and friendly.
Unnatural is an amazing show about forensic pathologists. No romance iirc.

"Still to this day everytime I stub my toe or somethin my ""ahh"" is swiftly followed by motherland

**AHH MOTHER LAND!!!**"
"One professor's opinion, recorded earlier this year:

I see no room for controversy here
"""IF THAT HAD BEEN A DRUG DEAL I WOULD'VE SHOT HOTEL LUXURY LINENS IN THE FACE!"""
It is so perfect. A life long weird nerd suddenly gets a unhealthy over the top confident boost and he acts exactly how that would work out.
Death note
"I'm surprised nobody has said it yet, but what about IT?  
Edit: So the general consensus is just to focus more on certs, and not all that much on the college side of things? If I was looking to go into tech support what would be a good job to have in high school to prepare? I would think something like retail so I have experience dealing with customers/people, but are there better options? Thanks again all of you, It's really helpful!"
"Or Mission Workshop, which was started by the Chrome founders after they sold the company.

It's like Chrome, but even better.

Goruck makes some very nice packs as well."
"My headache post ride would like to kindly disagree with you. I'll believe you more if you say it's enjoyable despite the roughness, but not rough at all?"
"I'd say that if you choose from a fairly large set of well supported distros this matters much less than it might first  seem. There is very little, if anything, you can do with Arch that you cannot do with Fedora or Ubuntu. Some things might be easier in Arch others in Ubuntu. My preference is for well known distros, I use Ubuntu, but I am not saying that is the only choice. Some of the things you mention are more about the default desktop environment choice than distro per se. In all decent distros changing the desktop environment is very easy. 

The big difference to me seems to be how bleeding edge you want your software to be. One thing that my fifteenish years with Linux has taught me is that obsessing over having the newest version of any app you use is a tiring rabbit hole."
