Yea, I what it is is that nobody provides all three:

1. Costs about the same or less than a Tesla
2. Charges about as fast or faster than a Tesla
3. Has as about the same or more range than a Tesla

Mach-e does #1 and #3. Taycan does #2 and #3. Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf does #1 and #3 (if you compare to the short range Teslas).  ID.4 does #1.  Hyundai Kona does #1 and #3.

Nobody has yet hit the trifecta."
16077,best sunglasses for fashion,"Serengeti is owned by Bushnell. Advanced optics (polarization, photochromic lenses) are standard, and they can be found at the same price point as non-polarized Luxottica shades. I've had the same pair of Serengeti Napolis as driving glasses for probably 10 years and 3 cars, and I have no plans to replace them. I left my Wayfarers at a bar in NYC, found a pair of Serengeti Carlo for $45 on EyeDictive to replace them, and now couldn't care less I don't have my Wayfarers. 

I'm with you on the Luxottica front. I have a pair of Wayfarers from the 60s when they were made by Bausch and Lomb, and those things are tanks. The pair I lost weren't even comparable."
