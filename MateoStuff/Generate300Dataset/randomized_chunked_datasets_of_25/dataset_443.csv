I loved early and mid-period Neal Stephenson (especially Snowcrash, Cryptonomicon, and Anathem) but I found his later stuff disappointing.",best science fiction novel

I love the 2 tone of this pair, it gives you a unique experience from the frame illuminating from the sunlight.

45429,"Do you have a game bar or gaming cafe where you can try them out?
I'd do that before investing.

Since you have a PC already you can play Xbox games via win 10 and Xbox anywhere. Just get a controller and an HDMI cable to connect to your TV. That controller also will have support built in to Steam.

Sony's releasing PS5 soon so I'd read up on that before buying into PS4.

That leaves the Switch, which has a LOT of fun games. 

Just some food for thought.

12445,"I wrote her a little story. Seriously, short enough to be written for a four-year-old. I wrote it in my best handwriting and bound it in some fancy paper that I bought at the craft store. It cost me maybe 10 bucks in materials, maybe an hour of my time if you count the round-trip drive to the craft store. But I put all my love into the story.

It’s framed and sitting on a shelf by her front door, so it’s the first and last thing she sees as she leaves and comes home every day. It has been there for the last six years.",best gifts for mom
18630,"Probably said before but I absolutely adore Ashens, his dry british humor is something that not a lot of people around me dig but I personally think he’s hilarious and his voice is usually pretty soft and pretty easy to listen to, and of course I’d be scorned for not mentioning the originator of the “Chef Excellence” meme! He usually reviews crappy Poundland (Dollar Store) items, knock-off/real gaming consoles of interest, and crappy instant food. He’s my go-to sleep playlist!

I should also mention that he has a collaboration channel with some of his friends and they make delightful videos as well, it’s called Barshens. This one’s more of a variety type channel, but still good stuff! I know at least Barry has a channel of his own too where he does more cooking-centric content called My Virgin Kitchen.
