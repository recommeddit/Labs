19211,best YouTube video,Wickenburg was a total loss before those temps tbh
25925,best cricket teams of all time,Where did you get the data?
68670,best science fiction novel,"The Three Body Problem trilogy has been the standout in recent years for me. Also I think Alastair Reynolds Revelation Space books are up there, despite my annoyances with them. I loved early and mid-period Neal Stephenson (especially Snowcrash, Cryptonomicon, and Anathem) but I found his later stuff disappointing."

16267,best sunglasses for fashion,"After losing my beloved Ray Bans to the ocean while drunk, I upgraded to Persol and love them even more!  You feel the quality and I got a good deal at sunglass hut for buying 2 pairs of polarized sunglasses.

I love the 2 tone of this pair, it gives you a unique experience from the frame illuminating from the sunlight.

43457,best items under $100,"This is so wholesome I could die. 

I started keeping and growing plants and herbs, and just *not killing them* feels like such a huge accomplishment. Seeing a new sprout is like a celebration. 

Now I understand why people have graduations for kindergarten."
33350,best electric car,"I don't know why they aren't brought up more often, but the BMW i3 is a great deal used. You can go full bev, range will be limited, or you can get one with a range extender which can be more helpful on long trips."
45429,best gaming system,"Do you have a game bar or gaming cafe where you can try them out?
I'd do that before investing.

Since you have a PC already you can play Xbox games via win 10 and Xbox anywhere. Just get a controller and an HDMI cable to connect to your TV. That controller also will have support built in to Steam.

Sony's releasing PS5 soon so I'd read up on that before buying into PS4.

That leaves the Switch, which has a LOT of fun games. 

Just some food for thought.

51485,best iphone case,"Agreed. It doesn’t necessarily feel BIG, but it’s certainly different than how slender the phone feels outside of the case. Hard to find a good middle ground."
12445,best gifts for mom,"I wrote her a little story. Seriously, short enough to be written for a four-year-old. I wrote it in my best handwriting and bound it in some fancy paper that I bought at the craft store. It cost me maybe 10 bucks in materials, maybe an hour of my time if you count the round-trip drive to the craft store. But I put all my love into the story.

It’s framed and sitting on a shelf by her front door, so it’s the first and last thing she sees as she leaves and comes home every day. It has been there for the last six years."
18630,best YouTube video,"Probably said before but I absolutely adore Ashens, his dry british humor is something that not a lot of people around me dig but I personally think he’s hilarious and his voice is usually pretty soft and pretty easy to listen to, and of course I’d be scorned for not mentioning the originator of the “Chef Excellence” meme! He usually reviews crappy Poundland (Dollar Store) items, knock-off/real gaming consoles of interest, and crappy instant food. He’s my go-to sleep playlist!

I should also mention that he has a collaboration channel with some of his friends and they make delightful videos as well, it’s called Barshens. This one’s more of a variety type channel, but still good stuff! I know at least Barry has a channel of his own too where he does more cooking-centric content called My Virgin Kitchen. Give em a try! c:"
12222,best gifts for dad,"Books, I never seem to get any now unless i specifically ask for it, and are a lot more useful than most stuff given, although usually the deodorant given means i only have to buy it for about half of the year."
46476,best trick or treating candy,"I had the same experience.  It is based on google searches, so maybe it some kid asking google ""what the hell is this?""

I hope not though... what poor kid never had a snickers?"
24347,best anime,It's wild that 4 of the top 5 are specifically commentary on anime or deconstructions of genre and medium

70072,best major to study in college,"you get out what you put in, truth. students who interact with professors and use (free!) school resources are getting more out of college than people who are only hoping for further delay of the ""real world,"" so to speak"
71209,best movies with a cool twist,"No, not really, lol. I just love it so much and it was a recent referral to someone else so it was on my radar"
7133,best iPhone,"""I currently have an 10"" man that's so weird to read."
57297,best water brand,"""taste the dryness of 1000 suns"""
31798,best hotel to live in,"Kids.  College students that return home during the summer to babysit kids.  The people who run day care centers for kids.

I think you see what I'm getting at here."
19395,best YouTube video,two drums and a cymbal fall off a cliff
46100,best trick or treating candy,"Sorry, Twizzlers are leaving my bag"
56513,best desktop monitor,"Do they have one of these in 1080p? I am looking for a good and affordable gaming monitor with gsync but I only want/need 1080. 

I have a 1070 Ti ftw2 so I mean should I consider just getting the 1440?"
