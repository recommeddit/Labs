Beautiful tree.
Scotland should be there
"It's *reeeaaallly* hard to narrow it down to one, I'd have to go with Jim Brown.  
I can honestly say he'd have all the rushing records if he would have played more than 8 years. The man's a beast."
"My mother swore by these when I was growing up, but all they did was make me nauseated."
"If it's in the US. I would go with something native, like persimmons or pawpaws and also include hazelnuts. These are things you don't often see in the store, they're easy to maintain and could fetch a premium on the boutique side of things."
"Yeah wow rarely have I ever gone from ""this book is great!"" to ""nope. not one more page"" than in SevenEves"
Blindfold and ear plugs.
"[These](https://www.smartbuyglasses.com/designer-sunglasses/Marc-By-Marc-Jacobs/Marc-By-Marc-Jacobs-MMJ-477/S-D28/E5-296781.html#).  

I wear prescription glasses daily (I'm short sighted) and it sucks I can't have lenses put in these because I adore them but I totally can't see when I wear them.  But I always get comments on the shape and style.  They're classic but with a twist."
Rayban Clubmasters are my only pair and I love them
"Yup, this is exactly how I word it. HD for materials, Lowe's for products works too"
"it's slow enough, and I enjoy tiny ultra responsive console things like nnn"
"It's not accurate. But those are good albums. Madvilliany and Endtroducing are definitely not top 10 albums of all time but that doesn't take away the Classic album status. Kendrick bring on there twice is laughable but those are great albums. Nas, Wu tang and tribes albums are debatable. I haven't heard Danny Browns album so I can't say much there. Kanye has a couple Classics that can be debated over MBDTF. Just my opinion though."
The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library is actually pretty cool.
Original honest to god Old Spice. I love that stuff.
"At least you aren't at the mercy of a fragile piece of cane.  Those things can get fiddly, and can change behavior during a concert when the weather changes.  Sometimes they split or get chipped at the end if you're not careful (I play trombone and bassoon, so I can sympathize with everybody)"
"I don't typically eat breakfast - if I do it's a few bites of whatever I'm packing for lunch.

But, when I do have time - scrambled eggs and a couple strips of bacon."
"She's always cold, and she has really enjoyed Gwen Frostic prints for as long as I can remember. So I got her an Afghan blanket that has Gwen Frostic art on it. Unfortunately it was smaller than I would have hoped but she really likes it.

This year, I think I am going to get her an electric blanket that plugs into the cigarette lighter of the car. Can't use it while driving obvs but my brother-in-law has one and swears by it for when he's riding shotgun. Seems like something she would really like."
Naaaaaiilll
"Yes, Mt. Mitchell is 400 feet taller than Mt. Washington (6,684 to 6,288).  But it's so much warmer and further south, you don't get the same alpine climate effect."
