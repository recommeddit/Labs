1326,best ice cream flavor,"My local ice cream place makes an espresso Oreo ice cream. It's coffee ice cream with chunks of Oreo in it. I don't even like coffee, but that ice cream is to die for.

...Now I really want some. But I'm sure they're closed. Damn virus!"
24018,best anime,"I'm not that good at this, but I'll try.

What I liked most about Steins;Gate is that is has some of everything. Do you like comedy? S;G has a lot of it, especially at the beginning. Do you like romance? S;G has an excellent romance. Most of all, do you like a conclusive story without any big plotholes? S;G has it. 

It's amazing story is probably its main selling point. The plot is very well thought out and doesn't really have any plotholes, it is a complete story. It is also an emotional story. After a certain point, it will become an emotional rollercoaster till the last episode. 

None of the characters are completely standard, they always have something that makes them different from the standard stereotypes. Especially Okabe and Kurisu are well developed. Both look like stereotypical characters at the start, but they are anything but, as you'll find out.

Another thing is, the science behind what is happening is explained quite well, and without any big errors in the physics parts. Of course it's impossible in real life, but it cleverly uses real physical theories, that are already used in those circumstances.

Of course, it does start of slow. I didn't really mind, but S;G is almost two shows in one. About the first half is almost a SoL comedy, while the second half is the Sci-fi mystery. It is mostly the second half that causes people to praise it.

All in all, I probably like S;G so much because it feels so complete to me. It is always possible that it is just not your thing though, but you should at least try if you have some free time and watch it."
46838,best hand santizer brand,"They serve different purposes.  Soap binds to dirt and water removing it from your hand.  Alcohol kills most germs in about 20 seconds but does not remove dirt.  One strategy would be to wash one's hands with soap and water and use the alcholol immediately afterwards.  Alcohol is also good at sanitizing surfaces though bleach is also good at killing germs so one could substitute a bleach for alcohol for the surfaces.

The time alcohol spends on the surface/hand is also very important — it has to be in sufficient quantity that the alcohol does not evaporate before it has done its work.  It has to remain for the full 15 to 20 seconds.

Alcohol is also very good at loosening grease from surfaces so useful, when combined with a cloth or tissue, for cleaning phone screens, watch faces, glass, &c."
24225,best anime,"Both great anime and well-deserving of their spot.

If you like Penguindrum, you'll probably like Utena (made by the same director), which is #3 on the list."
8505,best toothpaste,my dad's a dentist. i cant remember the last time i paid for oral hygiene products.
13682,best research paper archive,Or just use scihub through tor.
55425,best action and adventure novel series,"Not a novel per se, but ""Lost City of Z"" by David Grann is a fantastic read. Tells the story or a real-life adventurer and fortune seeker who disappeared searching for a rumored city in the South American jungles. It's literary nonfiction, so it reads more like a novel than a history book but includes a ton of corroborating research done by Grann (who is a great writer anyway)."

38235,best newspapers to read,"NYT is a good paper, they're very competent, but like WaPo and like WSJ they tend to shove politics where they don't belong.  That said, each of these papers is basically slightly biased an in favor of a mostly moderate ideology."
13554,best research paper archive,"There isn't an equivalent to arXiv, but papers may well be deposited openly in institutional repositories."
35174,best NFL player,You're fucking high if you think Aaron Donald isn't going to be the top non QB.
66834,best soccer team in the world,"They are also a top 5 national team (at least) and most of their best players are young attackers which are the most expensive kind of player. Any team with Sancho, Mount, Rashford, Foden, Sterling, Kane, Grealish, Bellingham, Saka and Calvert Lewin all at the same time is obviously going to be worth an astronomical amount of money.

A lot of France's best players are defenders, and some of their best in other positions are on their way to 30 or over that which decreases their value."
