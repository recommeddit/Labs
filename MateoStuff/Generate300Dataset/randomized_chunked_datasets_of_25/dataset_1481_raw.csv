Just because it was filtered via RO doesn't mean that was the only process it went through. A multi-stage water treatment system can start with RO and then pass the pure water through something that adds salts back in.
I just got the book from it being recommended all the time but haven't started it yet.
"I wanted to paint my baby's room grey. I thought it would be a perfect neutral and would allow me to change the decor to nearly whatever I wanted if I got bored. Husband said that it's ""weird"" and ""sad"" to paint a baby's room grey... Ok, valspar ballet slippers it is then! I still wish we did grey and let her decide when she's older that color she liked best. Meh, I personally live pink so it's all good."
A green shirt. She was so happy I remembered her offhand comment about her wanting one.
"Ah, thank you. That was a very helpful answer!"
"The important thing is that he got the presidency through succession rather than being elected to it.

But there is actually a pretty cool wiki page on this:

Can't go wrong with *A Fire Upon the Deep* either. I never read Deepness in the Sky but I'll put it on my list.
"IMO depends.  
I have a matte screen protector on my 2018 11"" Pro and love it. That's because my priorities are notetaking and drawing/art. I do a little video/picture editing as well, and haven't noticed any color distortion, but then again I'm not a professional so even if there is, it's not a big deal to me. So like I said, it depends on what you intend to do with your ipad."
I’m a big fan of Earl Grey tea; I drink it pretty much every day. Found a gelato place on vacation that had an Earl Grey flavor and I can still taste how wonderful it was.
"Much appreciated, also would there be any real benefit to trying for a higher price bracket or would that be just a waste (for an average gamer)"

"but won't u admit his character spectrum is too narrow. 
like he can only really do a very few types of characters that somewhere resonate with his own personality making it easy for him..."
"There is a slight difference in clarity, but I haven't minded it all. Every matte screen protector has this issue. I've had screen protectors that were much worse that added a lot of the digital noise. I don't mind this one at all. Words still look very crisp. I won't be taking it off any time soon. As far as friction goes, it's somewhat similar to a paper texture. I enjoy writing on it more than the glass surface for sure. After using this one for a while I wouldn't spend the money on any of the expensive screen protectors out there. This one gets the job done perfectly for me."
I'm a cave drawing and I hate you all...

Does it add too much bulk with iphone 13 pro max ?
"If you can't afford $50K, then crying ""I want under $60K"" is silly. Rather than moving the goalposts, say the price you'll ACTUALLY consider buying at or stop BSing everyone."
"All of my dev machines are remote so I use vim if I want to make quick fixes from the shell, say for fixing up a small merge conflict or something. Otherwise, I use an IDE."
Shots of Jamison from my ridiculously hot neighbor.
Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male.  It makes me think bad things.  Nice bad things.
It’s different from their KS version. There’s a KS version and a retail version
">Are they less than 60 grand base price? If not I don’t care

you asked under 60k, which 50k is less than 60k. Not only that but a few are under 40k lol."
