"I would recommend two things.

1) Getting things done by David Alan. This is great for managing and organising of your whole life. It also covers managing task priority. It should give you a nice way to optimize the use of your time. Making sure you always have something lined up to do at the appropriate time to do it.

2)Use an unschedule rather than a schedule. (http://www.neilfiore.com/now-habit/ ) Map out your days by all the things you know you are going to have to do such as eat, wash, sleep pick up kids etc. And you'll be left with how much space you have for work, fun or whatever. Then just do the tasks you have to do and fill in how long they took after. 

You don't know how much time is required. If you look at the planning fallacy even the best experts are way off in their predictions of how long things will take. Even people who specialise in studying the planning fallacy underestimated how many years their study would take.

Use another metric to judge the quality of your work not how much time it takes to do it. You may want to assign yourself a total time goal for a project that you think anything more than that spent means your wasting time and adjust it as you continue accordingly as you know more about the project. You may feel it's more complex than before so increase the allowance, or that it's not a worthwhile project so cut it short."
Fortunately you don't have to even if it happens.
Sec risk and assessment at Penn State... What don't you like about info sec?
"I also swear by Anker. I am currently using a PowerCore 13400 Nintendo Switch Edition. I have another newer PowerCore but for some reason I prefer the Nintendo Switch branded one. I am not sure how ""optimised"" it is for charging the Switch but it works very well and charges all my devices with PD. 

Anything by Anker with PD that is 10000 or more will be enough for an emergancy phone charge and what not."
I've been relatively happy with Xfinity (which uses Verizon).
My favorite is called leaves of grass. It is very floral though so it might not be for everyone.
Fabric softener? I would like to wake up after the drink.
The quality on this case was abysmal. I bought it for my 12 Pro Max

"It's a really nice park so yes, allow a full day and ride everything. There are some unique rides like like Schwarzkopf Ferris wheel, Von Roll sky ride, Arrow log flume, Houdini's Great Escape, Safari, classic Round Up, and Parachute Tower in addition to a fantastic lineup of roller coasters."
"I can't answer why, but even if there were a video where someone discovers a cure for both AIDs and cancer at the same time, the comments would still be the worst thing in the world."

Go to Taft. Red Bull team trains there sometimes. A jumper landed in my backyard once when I was a kid. Good times :)
"Bought mine last month, everything works perfectly. Everything is great about this Phone, i think the only difference we‚Äôll notice will be the new features added to the new phones, apart from that i hope the experience we‚Äôll have will be pretty much the same in the coming years"
