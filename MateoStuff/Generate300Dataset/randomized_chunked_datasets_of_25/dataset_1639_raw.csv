Drink lots of clear fluids, too, and avoid dairy."
Oh cool
openSUSE Tumbleweed would be my advice :)
This is also important. She would have been awarded the Nobel Prize if she was still alive. The reason she gets no credit is just as much due to her death as it is Watson and Crick.

these folks have tons of experience, and the view is spectacular. there are good deals on groupon, too, which makes them a bargain in comparison to some of the other locations around the bay area.

skydive sacramento has a good deal for a tandem skydive from 13,000 feet. the highest allowable dive is 18,000 feet, after which you would need a self-contained breathing apparatus. skydiving out of Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay provide for the best scenery due to the oceanic views, but they are the most expensive and they tend to be from lower drop zones from 8,000 feet.

as a good measuring stick, at least on groupon, it is about $100-$150 from 8,000 feet.

I hope this helps!

That sound suspiciously like my dad's irish sangria recipe - it's 5-mississippi pour of scotch with a dash of cold water added to it. Are you my family?
I can’t see one unless you’re counting the Caspian Sea.
"VW e-Golf. I just bought a '16 SE w/ the dc fast charging package for $14k. The range is limited so you have make sure it's going to meet your needs, but I've been impressed. The battery seems to have a really stable chemistry, mine is in amazing shape after 5 years and 40k miles."

"I’m a big apple user but I’m still on the iPhone 8 as the newer phone features aren’t things I’m into although the new iTags or an telephoto type camera will likely get me upgrading.    
See what features you want to use and check which phones have them."

"Hamsters are pretty gross IMO. Lots of poo to clean and not very interactive. I hear bunnies can be trained to use a litterbox and rats (if you can get past the thought of it) are quite smart, trainable and affectionate. Bearded dragons and ball pythons make great small pets too and don't smell as bad as hamsters. Whatever you choose please do your research on what each animal requires for care and what is a good fit for your own family"
