"I dont know if these count. But I recently watched 2001: A Space Odysssey and 2010: First Contact.

Great to watch together IMO."
"I think your question should be what Trees. Youâ€™ve got plenty of room for a few trees, depending on what species you choose and where you chose to place them. Aspen, Oak, Kentucky Coffee, Honeylocust, Hackberry are all great shade trees. Serviceberry, Pagoda Dogwood, Blue Beech, Ironwood and Nannyberry trees are all great ornamental or understory species."
I won't buy anything other than Anker. Out of a couple dozen of their products I've only had a single cable go bad (10' micro USB) and it was replaced for free. Awesome products for the price and just as awesome customer service to back it up.
Actually never

"I agree with you in that they would not be a certifiable treatment for untreated drinking water in and of itself (in most cases).  Carbon filters in general can significantly improve the quality of untreated water, and is actually one of the processes used by most municipal treatment facilities.  The OP did not specify treated/untreated water.

My understanding of the question is the OP is wanting to know if the carbon filters actually do anything useful.  And yes, they are one of the most cost-effective treatment processes in creating safe drinking water.  Activated carbon has been used for thousands of years in this manner."

"Cool! I'm buying this right now! :)

Anything comparable for soaps? Samplers may be harder, but a collection like that is pretty nice.

"I've been using large Anker and Ravpower banks for years. They've been okay. I got the zendure powertank maybe 6 months ago, and it's been fantastic.  I wanted pass through charging and 65W or better USB type C output, and it supports both of those. The biggest issue is that it's pricy, and their new powertank model is even more expensive."
"> It certainly does. But the light quality is fine, and some things you don't need to BIFL.

Uh... good for them?  But the title of the post clearly starts with ""BIFL request"" not ""cheap, but good enough for a couple years request""."
