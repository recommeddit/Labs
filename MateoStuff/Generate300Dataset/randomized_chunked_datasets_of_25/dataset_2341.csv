47726,best state to visit in the United States,"No love for Louisiana yet?

There's a lot of choices, but first things first, I'd recommend staying south of Alexandria - no disrespect to North Louisiana, but it's not all that different from Mississippi/Arkansas/East Texas.

Honestly, most of your tour of Louisiana can stick pretty close to Interstate 10, which runs through Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge and New Orleans. That route will also get you pretty close to some of the outstanding fishing and hunting lodges the state has to offer. 

Louisiana has some excellent brackish water fishing, as well as superb hunting all along the Gulf Coast. You really can't go wrong. Do a bit of research before booking an outing. There are some fantastic lodges all along the I-10 corridor.

If you're within 10-20 miles of Lafayette, make extra sure to stop somewhere (anywhere, really) selling boudin and cracklins. That is some top-notch Cajun food. My personal favorite is a little red shack in a town called Scott, which is just a few miles west of Lafayette.

This should really hold true for any of the southeastern states on your list, but you absolutely **must** get your way into a proper LSU tailgate before a Saturday night Tigers game. High marks if you can get to an Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, or Arkansas game. Extra extra high marks if you can get Alabama tickets. My father and I tailgated for a season several years ago, and it was hands down one of the most incredible experiences I've ever witnessed. Outstanding food, copious amounts of booze, passionate and hospitable fans. Just be sure you're wearing purple and/or gold. I'm dead serious.

New Orleans doesn't really need much explanation beyond what you already know. Yes, the food is exceptional, Mardi Gras is what you'd expect a frat house to look like if you made an entire *city* out of it, and JazzFest is one of the most popular music festivals you'll find in the Southeast. Bourbon Street is what you make of it. It can be tits and Hurricanes if you want it to be, but if you're more laid back, you can definitely find some great bars to sit back and people watch. Old Absinthe House and Jean Lafitte's are my two personal favorites. Also, definitely give the Carousel Bar at Hotel Monteleone a shot, too. Avoid Decatur St., though. Very touristy and overpriced."
