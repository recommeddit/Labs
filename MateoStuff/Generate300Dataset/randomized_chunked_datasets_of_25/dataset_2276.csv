22837,"George Clooney. A while back I was living with my best friend and his dad. His dad worked for a trucking company that was contracted to pull the actor trailers/Set peices/ you name it/ for the set of The Ides of March. Once in a while they would drive the actors to set if they were told to do so. Everyday when he got home I'd ask him if he ran into George since I knew he was directing/acting in the film, most of the time he didn't see anyone but he came in from work and told me that he actually got to talk with ""Mr. Clooney"" as he called him. 

Apparently he was walking around one of the trailers and almost bumped into him. Instead of getting pissed George just kinda laughed and starting punching his stomach jokingly then told him ""What if I was carrying coffee, Mike?"". Now, according to my friends dad George had only heard his name once before when George had asked him to do something for him about 3 weeks beforehand. Then they chatted about life and all that for about a half hour.

So, not only did George Clooney not get pissed when my friends dad about plowed him over but he remembered his name after really only hearing it in passing and then just chatted up with him.",best celebrity
