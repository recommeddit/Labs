Yes! She wrote a LOT more. But the quality varies. 

The Blue Castle is her only ""adult"" romance. A woman with a heart condition who has been told it's fatal works up the gumption to ask her crush, who is barely an acquaintance, to marry her for convenience's sake, to escape her horrible family. It's super adorable and I've been intending a reread for awhile. 

There's the Emily trilogy. This was Montgomery's attempt to write a more ""serious"" self-insert who also aspired to be an author like she did. Like Anne, it's about an orphaned girl sent to live with older, conservative people who struggles with adapting to their lifestyle, though eventually they all get along. It lacks a lot of the comedy of Anne, and sometimes Emily is an annoying cool girl who's too good for everyone and is self-consciously beautiful as well, groan. Her struggles as a writer are sometimes really a lot and feel a bit gratuitous, all this stuff about her art and not sacrificing ideals and whatever. Actual Montgomery was romantic but extremely practical about her work, writing what would sell because she had to, and so maybe this was a bit of venting some leftover idealism for her.

 What is really fun are the friend squad interactions. Emily's bestie, Ilse, is the complete opposite of Diana Barry in AOGG, and it's super fun - she's outlandish and crazy, they argue like nuts, and love each other a lot. Perry, the farm labourer turned academic star turned politician, is this wonderful mix of declasse and clever and his dialogue with Emily has so much intellectual chemistry. Emily's love interest, Teddy, is boring AF, unfortunately, and they don't interact much. But there's another love interest, Dean Priest, who...well, he certainly comes across as creepy in 2020, because he falls for the adolescent Emily as a full-grown adult and decides to be in her life to see if she's eventually interested in being with him, which, EW, but teen me thought that was very romantic indeed. He's a snarky, unconventional, not very attractive smart guy and I just really liked him even if he's not always the best guy. Anyway, those are worth a try! 

The Story Girl is another two-volume episodic work, collecting, as the title suggests, stories surrounding island farm life, mostly generated by a group of children consisting of siblings and cousins. It's told from a young man's perspective and IMHO it's one of her stronger young adult books. The general idea of this book series, a group of kids led by a charismatic, imaginative young woman into small town misadventures, is what eventually became the ""Road to Avonlea"" Canadian TV series of the 90s. (There's a Montgomery short story collection called ""Road to Avonlea,"" but the premise of this family in the Story Girl books, IIRC, is the foundation of the show, and the short story series compiles various tales from the lives of everyone in the Canadian small town without a central cast of characters). The direction of that show was extremely saccharine and family values-oriented in a way that didn't quite respect the humor and sharpness of Montgomery's best work, IMHO. 

There's Pat of Silver Bush, and Magic for Marigold, Jane of Lantern Hill,  in which Montgomery deploys the ""smart girl on a farm/isolated environment, living with older relatives"" trope thing again, and they aren't super memorable - more like alternate takes on familiar territory. 

Oh! There's a couple other new-adult-ish romance books. Kilmeny of the Orchard is about guy crushing after a mute girl who plays the violin beautifully. It's kind of cute - I don't remember it super well, though teen me was extremely into the whole ""forbidden love/barrier to communication/shutaway"" thing. And A Tangled Web, some crazy melodramatic multigenerational family curse story that resolves with several romances. I have been meaning to reread this, since I read it as a kid when I was too young to cotton to some grownup marriage drama plot. But when Montgomery goes serious, it often falls quite flat, and I suspect this is the case here.",best romantic novel

65349,">What are you using to see what band you are using? 

LTE Discovery to see the bands (they've added 5g recently), 
network signal guru and QCT Modem Capabilities to force bands.

>Also what devices are you using. 
I have a pixel 4a 5g (unlocked, so without the mmWave radio).

So I can force band 5 LTE easily here, but it doesn't switch over to 5g. Every time it switches to 5g, it's either on band 66 or band 2. I'm confident that I'm on those bands because I'm forcing those bands and double checking with the discovery app, that I am indeed on those apps. Once I establish the LTE discovery app works consistently, I stop forcing any bands and I can see how it automatically switches to B2 and B66 to get to 5g.",best phone service company

I'm not surprised by this. In my opinion 2014-2016 was when a ton of really great board games all came out at once. It's like there was a slow build up and then an explosion in 2014. Honestly I'm sort of wondering if that was a bit of a golden age.

32194,"I stayed at Il Sogno Di Giulietta in Verona, just across the courtyard from Juliet's house with the famous balcony. As a shakespeare nerd I had a lot of fun staying someplace that felt so exclusive and having access to the tiny courtyard after hours. Even though Juliet's house is so touristy and it was kind of annoying having to fight the tourists, it was a cute place. 

The rooms themselves were phenomenal. My boyfriend and I could each lay out on the bed and starfish without touching each other. I've never slept in such a nice bed in my life. Then there were the jacuzzi tubs, the smart system set up in the rooms, the excellent in room breakfast.
