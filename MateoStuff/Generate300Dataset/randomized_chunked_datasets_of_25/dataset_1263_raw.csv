"I looked through all these, and as a mother of a soon to be 3 month old, I wouldn't wqnt any of these.  Not because they're not good gifts, but just because they're not good gifts for me.

Good gifts for me?  Silhouette machine or stand mixer because those are tools that would make my hobbies easier and more fun.

Becoming a mom didn't cause my interests and hobbies to change.  You know your wife better than a bunch of strangers.  Get her something for HER."
I use Nord and honestly I love it. Itâ€™s been almost a year now and I havenâ€™t received any more pesky emails from my internet provider about torrenting. And the speed is great. It also has a killswitch feature like most vpn. I recommend it.

"My personal favourite, long Island iced tea, definitely fits the bill. Make sure you use sugar syrup instead off adding granulated sugar like some degenerate recipe makers would have. 

1 part vodka
1 part white rum
1 part tequila 
1 part cointreau
1 part gin
1 part sugar syrup
1 part lemon juice 

Mix in shaker. Half fill a highball glass with ice, fill half way with cola and gently top it up with the deadly mix of spirits. It'll look like a haribo cola bottle if done correctly. 

Enjoy ðŸ˜Š"
"I agree, I poop every morning but no matter how much I wipe it just doesn't come clean so that is why I poop and then shower every morning"
Anyone got this infographic in text form? Having it as an image that can't be searched and can't be copy/pasted from is kind of useless
"Nectarine and Honey by Jo Malone! It's floral, smells like sunshine to me (??) and it's kind of a ""soft"" scent since they were designed to be layered."

"Giri/Hagi. Anglo-Japanese crime thriller that's got everything, great characters, tight plotting, and quite a lot of humor, actually. Unlike anything I've ever seen. Very highly recommended."
PS4 pro since pc has Xbox exclusive
"[The Week](http://theweek.com/) magazine (not the website, which I'm not familiar with) has the least bias of anything I read. I don't necessarily think that makes it all that great; I'd give it up before I gave up the Economist."
"We had a really defensive and organized team with our old manager, so we tied a lot with stronger teams like brazil and argentina and also did pretty good in friendlies (last being 4-0 against japan) then we lost 3 games in a row but beat chile so I guess that was enough to stay at 28."
"Iâ€™ve run into Stephen King a few times in Bangor, Maine. Heâ€™s a chill dude, always willing to smile and chat a bit."

"Thank you so much for this. So many anime lists are written through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy and I often find myself wading through hours of explosions and fanservice to find anything remotely of interest to someone who hasn't been a teenager for a couple of decades. For example, neither Mushishi nor Cowboy Bebop making the top 25 at [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php) says a lot about the voting demographic."

"I disagree with that the thing is he was choosing bad scripts like bombay velvet, roy and adhm(myopinion) and jagga jasoos too"
"See my edit, I'm not against libraries. Use one if you need it!"

"Yokota- AU or Docomo, Softbank sucks here too."
"I honestly wouldn't floss had I not discovered floss picks. It's so much easier and quick. I keep them in sight, so if I ever go into the bathroom for whatever reason, I might just floss for the fuck of it since it's such a quick process."
"oh my god oled panels are the best. It's a shame that  burn in is still somewhat of an issue, so they arent making any smaller (27 - 32"") monitors. And 48"" is way too big for me, and these two TVs ofc are way too expensive. I currently have the 27"" IPS LG GL850, which is (was?) considered a very good monitor, however the low contrast, terrible blacks/grays etc, and bleed are just fking the worst. Kinda wish I had bought a VA panel, maybe it'd be better.. 
I have a 65"" OLED tv as my main TV in the living room, and also an oled panel in my phone, and the pc monitor just doesn't compare to these..."
