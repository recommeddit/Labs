61357,Best RPG game on PS4,"Came here to say this. The characters are well written and storyline is rich, but it isnâ€™t overwhelming if you havenâ€™t played the prior two games."
51550,best iphone case,"Thatâ€™s about what mine was. Only lasted about 4 months before that started happening. What was worse with mine is after about a month or two, it got greasy and sticky. I avoid them now because of it. Couldâ€™ve been me, I have fairly oily skin, but it was just really gross"

Cancelled my subscription."

48412,best color to paint with,"Ah awesome! Okay Iâ€™d do a light grey. This way it gives you a lot to work with on the walls and you can incorporate any â€˜coolâ€™ colors you want / blue pallets. And can use accents color like yellow.  [this](https://st.hzcdn.com/simgs/f4a1dfb602a9e1ca_4-0527/home-design.jpg) would look gorgeous, or even something like [this](https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/560c37dd7da26e3235ad995e/4:3/w_1200,h_900,c_limit/gray-living-room-01.jpg) with an accent wall. Either way, youâ€™re gonna knock it out of the park with a space like that"

28280,best breakfast foods,"Microwave an egg in a coffee cup. Make sure you cover it with a coffee filter or paper towel and don't cook too long or it'll explode all over the inside of your microwave. Toast an English muffin or bagel, put a slice of deli ham or turkey, the egg, a slice of cheddar cheese, some hot sauce or ketchup. Homemade breakfast sandwich in less than 5 minutes."

If you are looking for lightweight, consider the XFCE desktop environment. This can be chosen on install if you use Debian or by downloading Xubuntu if you choose Ubuntu.

Your Desktop Environment (DE) will largely determine the look and feel of your Linux experience, but it also affects how much RAM you need. Cinnamon is based on the GNOME desktop, which is very beautiful and customizable, but it comes at a cost in memory usage. I've never seen a side-by-side comparison of XFCE vs. Cinnamon, but I know XFCE is much lighter than standard GNOME. I also think it's prettier than LXDE, the other leading lightweight DE.

I will also suggest that you don't need a long-term service version. I'm a relative newbie, too, and I thought that ""stable"" meant ""less likely to break"", but it's really more like ""unchanging"". If you use Ubuntu 20.04, you will basically be using versions of applications from late 2019 for the life of the release. New versions of Ubuntu come out every six months, and they will already have been tested for roughly six months at that point. They are very unlikely to have major bugs. It's also easy to upgrade from one version to the next.

So, my final recommendation is Xubuntu 21.04, then upgrade to 21.10 when it comes out next month. Lightweight, newbie-friendly, well supported, and reasonably up-to-date."

73847,best matte screen protector for ipad,Just don't go for paperlike. I liked it at the beginning but after like a month/ month and half of using it with pencil the iPad became unusable as the foil became super scratched by the pencil.
