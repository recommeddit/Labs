"Cold Creek checking in.  Agreed, Adirondacks don't get enough credit.  My favorite, Lake Tear of the Clouds.  Great hike that leads to great peaks."

"I found Aviators to personally sound better and be more comfortable, albeit a bit more expensive ($40? vs $80)"
"Not just that, but in an era when passing stats weren't gaudy like they are today, and he's STILL not really within reach of anyone playing at a much more pass-heavy time. The guy who'd have probably been most likely to catch him just spazzed himself out of the league."
Austin seemed like a city full of hipsters to me. Maybe I visited the wrong day.
"Hyperion,
Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse),
Red Mars

They're pretty much the whole scale of sci-fi science ""accuracy"" as well!"
This was a great idea. Good job mate
Yeah. go Tak!
don't forget those french people don't even have English as an official language anymore.
I own a Triwa watch.  It’s over 2 years old and it still looks to be in mint condition.
What was the twist in The Game? That it was actually a game? I watched it recently and was generally unsurprised.

"1- Tauer, L'air du Desert Marocain... so smoky, leathery (the good, birchy kind, not the overly synthetic kind), and densely spicy, and yet also sparkling, aromatic, and airy. I can't find anything wrong with this one.

2- Serge Lutens, Fille en Aiguilles... evocative nostalgic pine forest smell; it captures the sweetness of hot dry pine in summer (even though people say this is a Christmas/winter scent).

3- Serge Lutens, La Fille de Berlin... a smooth, herbal, honeyed, and slightly crisp rose. Classy and pretty, this is one of the more ""womanly"" scents I have (though a man could wear it, of course), and I love that it still has a slight edge to it, because Lutens.

4- L'artisan Parfumeur, Safran Troublant... FdB can be my spring/summer rose, and this can be my winter rose. A spicy floral-vanilla that's cozy, yummy, and a bit sexy at the same time.

5- L'artisan Parfumeur, Tea for Two... the best tea scent, like very aromatic earl grey with some extra smoke and spice. It reminds me of an austere intellectual woman who likes fine things.

6- Comme des Garcons, Incense: Avignon... I just really love frankincense and while am still exploring trying to find \*the one\*, I love that this feels easy to wear (casual, and soft somehow), while still standing out as arty and a bit edgy.

7- Comme des Garcons, Hinoki... a meditative spa in a wet forest... very true to its inspiration.

8- Frederic Malle, Portrait of a Lady... a lot is crammed in here: fruits, spices, incense, patchouli, ROSE, amber. I usually prefer minimalist-leaning fragrances, but this is just undeniably great. Maybe the fanciest thing I have (I am not fancy; I don't have a full bottle or anything, just a decant!).

9- Lush, Karma... a fave of younger me. I don't own it anymore but I want to get it again. I feel incredibly nostalgic when I smell it. And it still fits the profile of things I like... a little spicy, a little fresh, earthy, aromatic, coniferous. 

10- Guerlain, Mitsouko... I felt the need for a classic on here I guess; there aren't many I've tried yet but this is the one I've found most compelling. The peach note is so realistic compared to newer renditions of fruit, which mostly smell like candy. I'd love to smell an older formulation with real oakmoss.

Thanks for the prompt, it was fun! And I only own two of these as full bottles, so this clarified where I might want to focus my next purchase."

"Reddit, Niche, anywhere that students actually attending the universities (and not getting paid as tour guides) can give their anonymous opinions. If you have your heart set on a specific major, look for online rankings of how well each school you’re considering caters to that specific field of study. You’ll want the most resources and best environment possible"
"Murder Mountain,  The Staircase,  Madeline McCann,  wormwood,  Icarus, Wild Wild Country, Amy.

That’s off the top of my head these are all 5 stars"
