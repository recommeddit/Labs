$14k annual tuition is amazingly cheap for globally-recognized schools. That's what I paid to go to a comparable public university (in a different state) ten years ago. What you're really upset at is the cost of housing.

"Different voters, different values. 

Brown and Rice both have compelling cases. I prefer Rice, though not enough to get emotional about it and start claiming disrespect or criminality (if you saw the post when Rice was 3rd)."
"Tough call, it seems people are only thinking short term. A car you want to keep forever may be the best value. 

I have a salesman friend that bought an early Model S, free supercharging, free fast internet, 8 year guarantee. About 250K miles on it now and this will be his last car, probably 20+ more years.

Maybe add in some Korpiklaani and Eluveitie and you're pretty much sorted."

"Those people that are Andrew Garfield fans are probably the same subset that would enjoy that line of comics.
