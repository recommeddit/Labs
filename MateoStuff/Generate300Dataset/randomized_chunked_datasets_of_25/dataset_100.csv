40428,best midrange GPU,"3060 hasn't been even confirmed tho.
 It's possible Nvidia doesn't make one."
56472,best desktop monitor,"do not upgrade to 32, you will hate all monitors"
22600,best celebrity,"I have a friend who worked at a golf course he played at from time to time.  After the round he would apparently head into the clubhouse restaurant/bar with a huge posse, order upwards of $1,000 in food and drinks, be waited on hand and foot because he's Michael fucking Jordan, and then not tip whatsoever.  Literally *zero* tip."
11651,best gifts for dad,Lmao this is so good

39213,best web browser,"Opera's privacy is bad, but the browser itself it amazing. Especially on Android."
13743,best research paper archive,"This is my favorite study: [Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomised controlled trial.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11751349)

The most brilliant piece of understated satire I've ever read in a scientific journal."
72445,best keyboard switches,"Buckling springs. Each word you type has extra gravity with those. Basically typing on buckling springs just screams ""manly"". It's like hammering nails.

But, if you do not have the stamina for it, Topre is the best. Cherry is just meh compared to those."
41277,best instrument to play,Lap Slide Guitar in the style of David Gilmour.
35775,best alcoholic drink,"Long island iced tea. The quickest route to fucktardville I've ever had. That shit will make you teleport.

Edit: apparently many of us have somehow been violated by this drink."
9294,best toothpaste,"You can probably ask your doctor too, and get it filled at a pharmacy.

My dentist sells it for $12..."

20807,best workout music,A lot of Infected Mushrooms
36444,best alcoholic drink,"If you're watching your calories alcohol in general should be avoided. 9 calories per gram of alcohol, same as fat. But Indian tonic water is naturally lighter and I'm my opinion nice for gin and tonic."
59528,best perfume,"Oh this is easy lol. You like really sweet and girly perfumes! I can tell you like your gourmands and sugary scents. I think you’re in your early 20’s, maybe 22-25. You’re very feminine and extremely girly, very outgoing, loud, fun to be around, and personable with those around you. You love to stand out in a crowd but just like your taste in perfumes, you’re also sweet and adorable to boot! Probably work in fashion or something creative, like a designer or artist"
71748,best movies with a cool twist,"Wanted to second this not just with an upvote but also with a comment, as this movie is worth it."
4789,best home improvement store,"They like to have 5 different areas for the same category.

Need a washer for your hose and sink, that's in two separate places..... Absurd. 

Lowe's has it all in one spot. Lowe's price matches, Home Depot says they don't, not worth the fight to call corporate or show the manager their own site, which they don't want to look at cause it proves them wrong"
56246,best action and adventure movie,One of my favorite movies of all time. Glad someone put this on here. Couldn't recommend it more.
32087,best hotel to live in,Was this recent?
54979,best water filter,"I've tested the same way.  The tap is perfectly neutral pH while the Brita and some other brands always come out acidic.  Oddly enough, PuR filters make the water alkaline."
69470,best major to study in college,"Jokes on you, I'm getting a math degree too..."
