48477,"Sherwin Williams: Amazing grey and shoji white. We built a new house and I did trim grey and white walls.... contractor thought I wrote it backwards.  Its been 6 years and I still love it. And get lots of compliments. 

A tip when looking for white/cream/beige paint.... they all have a definite undertone whether that is cool (blue) or warm (red/yellows). I found it very enlightening to learn about the color wheel and how colors compliment or conflict with each other. Saved me a lot of money repainting too.",best color to paint with
6054,"Like seriously, how would you take a job as a peace officer/emergency services and just chill. I want folks to get back to their families unharmed at the end of their shift, but to ensure that maybe have 20 on your side since there’s way less bad guys instead of what they did. The father has some self control because something like that might break me. Like disillusionment and anger along with the usual feelings one would have toward criminals but so much more because so much more blame to go around, IMO,
It’s like that Parkland school resource officer. Why take a job that you had no intention of doing? Just be the hall monitor or something, dont use up tax dollars and stuff to be trained and armed for the hell of it.",best Netflix documentary

6006,"Woah, now kid (who am I kidding I am also a kid) Sublime is awesome, but try VSCode & learn Git & Github. VSCode is free, although u can easily crack Sublime but once u use VSCode u will never ever in ur entire life will touch another IDE or Code editor. & put stupid things on Github, u have no idea how people are crazy when they see u put stuff on Github. I got tons of job offers just bcz I upload to Github a lot. Although u must have some skills though but still. So as u are getting a lot thrown at u, I will give u an answer. Learn orderwise.

Learn JavaScript with You Don't Know JS
Learn React (for web) & React Native (for mobile bcz mobile is used by most people than desktop & people don't spend a lot of time on websites than apps)
Learn Node (for backend)

Now below are the things u might want to do after a year or so if u get bored -
Learn Java/Kotlin (for Android App making) or Swift (for iOS app making)
Learn C#(Unity) or C++(Unreal) (for making Games)

Now above languages for App making & Games making can be used for AR & VR as well. Now these techniques won't be skyrocketing till 2020 or so. But till the time you are grown up, this is the new shit. So don't waste a lot of time now, bcz if u learn this now u will secure your future. & drop out if u can bcz they don't teach shit no matter which country u live in or which college u go",best programming language for web development
