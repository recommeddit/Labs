26783,best board games,"I've never failed to have a good time with **Shadow Hunters**. In fact, the game is so good that I kept playing it with different friends who bought their own copies immediately afterwards. It's best with 6-8, it's pretty quick and light, there's some deduction and strategy, and best of all there are usually some hilarious card interactions, ""stand up dice roll"" moments and at least one surprising twist when someone reveals an unexpected identity. It's like a lighthearted Resistance. 7 Wonders is a good game for a similar number of people if they are serious enough gamers too handle the dry, cerebral, spreadsheet scoring type gameplay, but **Shadow Hunters** is a blast in comparison."

31547,best hotel to live in,Hands down the suites in MBS Singapore
37923,best Marvel movie,"On my rewatch, I actually liked the earlier films more than I remembered, and I think it's because they are made better because of connections to the later (and better) films. Especially Captain America First Avenger. I was *very* surprised at how well it fit in with Winter Soldier and Civil War when viewed in close proximity with them, even though it had a different director and was set in another era."
