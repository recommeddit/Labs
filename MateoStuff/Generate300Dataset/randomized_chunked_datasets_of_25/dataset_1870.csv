26783,"I've never failed to have a good time with **Shadow Hunters**. In fact, the game is so good that I kept playing it with different friends who bought their own copies immediately afterwards. It's best with 6-8, it's pretty quick and light, there's some deduction and strategy, and best of all there are usually some hilarious card interactions, ""stand up dice roll"" moments and at least one surprising twist when someone reveals an unexpected identity. It's like a lighthearted Resistance. 7 Wonders is a good game for a similar number of people if they are serious enough gamers too handle the dry, cerebral, spreadsheet scoring type gameplay, but **Shadow Hunters** is a blast in comparison.",best board games

37923,"On my rewatch, I actually liked the earlier films more than I remembered, and I think it's because they are made better because of connections to the later (and better) films.
