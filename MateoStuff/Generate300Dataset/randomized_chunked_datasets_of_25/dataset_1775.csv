44043,best items under $100,"I wasted so much money buying cheap pillows from Wal-Mart that went flat after a month. Then I bought a latex coconut pillow from Mattress Firm 2 years ago. 10/10 would buy that pillow again. 2 years later it's still perfect, although it doesn't smell like coconuts anymore."

57568,best cologne,"To add to this, OP needs to understand that those fragrance types (woodsy, floral, etc) *can* (but not always) correspond to a season.  Floral scents are out of place in a cold winter and better suited for spring and summer weather, for example.  This is, of course not a hard rule.

I’d also recommend finding a decanting service that will sell better functional samples (1oz bottles usually) to get a better feel for a scent than a department store or speciality store’s samples.  

Oh, and find a good scent-neutral deodorant.  You don’t want to rock your Old Spice or whatever when you’re wearing a lovely scent."
39766,best Chrome extensions,"You would like  Google's Arts n Culture too, then. It opens a new art piece every time you open a new tab"

66815,best soccer team in the world,"I already think Bergwijn is a very good winger, he's just struggled a little with his finishing in the last season. But the best football Spurs played under Mourinho was when Bergwijn was a regular starter. He missed some key chances but his movement and work rate was brilliant, and he set up good chances for others that they failed to finish.

He's got all the qualities and attitude of a very good winger, and his finishing in training is apparently fantastic, so I just hope it's a matter of time before that translates to getting 10+ goals in a season at some point soon."
29340,best game console,"Super Nintendo. It had some of my fave games. Super Mario, Street Fighter, Final Fight, etc. But, the main reason why its my fave is I used to play with my older brothers. I cherish those memories. My fave game though, was a pc game. My fave game is Doom."

41266,best instrument to play,"Hardcore woodwind enthusiast here:

Check out Legere synthetic reeds. 

Yes yes, I know the stigma behind synthetics, but these are made differently and are quality reeds.

I've made 1st chair allstate/all-region/university for years on those things, much to my teachers' disapproval. 

The resin isn't susceptible to humidity and temperature, they're much more durable (they don't permanently wear out!), and it really opens up your upper register. 

I use them on all my saxes (though I still like cane for bari, except when I'm playing jazz) and clarinets (minus the contras).

Still can't beat cane for double reeds though."
