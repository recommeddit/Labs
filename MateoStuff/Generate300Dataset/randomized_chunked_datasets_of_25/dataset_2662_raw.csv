"From arcade I can 100% recommend Bleak sword and Grindstone.

From non arcade, I absolutely adore Polytopia. Itâ€™s like civilisation but very simple and you can play on one phone with another person by passing the phone to each other."
Dude Billy Woods is fucking great. Such interesting rhyme schemes and beats on that project
American Vandals both season

"**FDR**    
He began his career in public service after flunking out of Columbia Law School. He then decided to run for governor of New York.

He was so devoted that the strain of leading the nation through a world war eventually killed him, although his legacy will never die."

"Many of the suggested vpn's on here are pretty good, but I still used this [nord deal](https://www.morecyberdeals.com/NordVPN/) for torrenting and have found it to be flawless for the past few months."
"This.  This.  My husband thinks it's a holiday I should spend with the family and the only thing I want is time alone.  I'm not an asshole, I love my daughter, but the best Mother's Day I ever had was when he let me go to the movies alone and he took care of her."
"Very, it was the match that lot the fuse to the American Revolution, and besides that,heavily influenced the geopolitical/cultural boundaries of the U.S and Canada, even to this day."

I once ubered Kimâ€™s body guard to Kimâ€™s HOUSE and yeah he was so handsome and nice. Gave me a big tip and left me a compliment. I wish I could remember his name :(
"Its not that surprising that KI is more popular than Holiday World in Indiana. Its about the same drive time from Indianapolis to KI as it is to Holiday World and the prices between the parks are not that different. KI is a much bigger park with more coasters and a lot of schools in Indiana take field trips there. Holiday World is great, but its in southern Indiana, which is less populated and is a much smaller park."
Gpu mining is already dying so we might see the oppsite
"Brick, where did you get a hand grenade?"

"In the NYC area, I was taught that Texas (unsurprisingly) decided the rules of the Spanish Empire didn't apply to them and went of of their way to cause a conflict to happen, knowing they would win.

This caused the mouse trap to spring when Mexico (justifiably) saw he annexation of Texas as an act of war. The US side knew that the crumbling post-Napoleonic colonies of the southern border were not going to be able to put up even a half decent fight, and so brutally rocked a weaker opponent.

It was a strategy to consolidate the resource rich lands to the south west as per Manifest Destiny."
