66687,best soccer team in the world,"People said the same about our NT between 2000-2008, but the unfancied, boring 2016 was the one to win. Labelling them a golden generation just adds extra pressure."
32814,best free online grammar checker,Grammarly does not pick up on comma splice run-ons or any of the sentence structure/length issues that crop up so often-- unless you pay for premium features.

26199,best politician,"Former Prime Minister on New Zealand Helen Clark. She pushed through Civil Unions, legalised prostitution, created the New Zealand super fund and Kiwisaver, got a Free Trade deal with China (along with Brunei, Chile, Singapore, and Thailand), started the TPP,  got rid of fighter pilots from the Air Force, made student loans interest free, unbundled the local loop for phone lines, cut child poverty, and reunited Labour with the left after the Lange government insanity while maintaining fiscal logic.

I really hope that she becomes UN Secretary General (even though I know that probably won't happen)"

48973,best gaming monitor,Same here. Great monitor!
41564,best instrument to play,"In practice I believe we can see good playing skills as something objective - you play good if you sound good. How good you are is the subjective part I think. As such, in my view the piano would still be one of the easiest instruments because you'd be able to sound good, good in any given measure, fairly quickly."

Of course, I haven‚Äôt really looked very hard yet."
