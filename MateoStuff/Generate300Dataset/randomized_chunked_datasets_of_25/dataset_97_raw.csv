"I could see him getting honorable mention, but I don't think he's top 100.  If you look at the rankings, players like Keenan Allen and Mike Evans are in the 90s.  I don't think you could put Lockett ahead of them."
"If you like chocolate, try World Class Chocolate, Gold Medal Ribbon, or Snickers!
If you're less of a chocolate person, try the Butter Pecan or Nutty Coconut!"

"1. Maison Francis Grand Soir (full bottle. People say I smell like cookies). 
2. Byredo flowerhead (best tuberose scent and lasts and lasts)
3. Vilhelm parfumerie Dear Polly (lovely easy tea scent. Feel expensive but I’m not sure exactly why)
4. Bond no 9 Greenwich village (just sample sample because the bottle price is crazy. Wish they’d make a 50ml bottle) 
5. Ds and Durga debaser (a fig that lasts and always makes me happy. I dream about this scent)
6. Diptyque philosykos edp (doesn’t last but I enjoy it. Haven’t purchased a full bottle but I’m tempted now and again). 
7. Le labo another 13 (first scent to get me into fragrance. I can smell it intensely and it’s like wearing cashmere)
8. Le labo tonka 25 (balsamic and cozy) 
9. Mmm replica by the fireplace (just wear this one at home and have a travel size)

Some I’m liking but still sampling: Chanel Jersey, pdm delina, Chanel 1957 and mfk petit Matin."
"Evil genius.
The only thing I'm gonna say is, I couldn't even imagine something like this happening."
Haha me too!  They and my cousin share the most common date of Birthdays in Australia.   Next bubs is due on my youngest cousins birthday so that would be too funny.
"Thanks! I will check it out. Is it truly all inclusive? Am looking for alcohol, food, and stuff to do lol."
You use Cydia and I don’t know the exact repo here is a link to a tutorial https://youtu.be/5mzIe51vrLo
"I have no idea how android notifications looks like . Try search r/jailbreak for “android” , you might see what you looking for."
"Yeah, it's very easy to wear ...like a comfy cozy cardigan."
"I think a big part of sustainable success is being able to figure out by yourself what is the right tool for the job you are trying to accomplish. Try new stuff, see how it works, then decide. Didn’t know people used to push Axios. Suggesting it, sure, but also offer alternatives, I’d say. Other than that discussion about it is always good. But the title does stick out like a sore thumb about an open source project."
Got any cool scifi racers like wipeout?
I karate chop mine and get the same effect
"Regularly get the Guardian and Independent. There are a few reporters in other papers that I like, but I don't like the papers (eg Peter Oborne in the Mail on Saturday).
G2 in the Guardian is my current fave crossword too."
"I’ve never heard of getting toothpaste kickbacks, ever. If they’re selling out of their office or writing a prescription, maybe. But no way someone is giving kick backs for a purchase that can’t even be traced."
Woodstocks is soooo overpriced for both the quality and quantity tho

I mean, come on, he had a spidercar that turned into a giant robot."
"Whisk(e)y is the lord of all alcohol. Beer is the best ""go to"". But in terms of practicality, wine is actually the best. It's a nice medium. Unlike beer, you don't have to drink as much to get pretty tipsy, while on the other hand you can drink a pretty good amount without getting wasted, unlike liquor."
"Enemies to lovers + Courtney Milan = Hold Me, the 2nd book in the cyclone series! It's a great independent read, no need to start w book 1. 

The elevator scene in the Hating Game was everything, I will give it that. 

I'm not usually a fan of historical so I've been hesitant to try Milan's non-cyclone books, but if she writes them with the same awareness and development as cyclone then I really should give them a try."
The first game was good.  The 2nd was great.  The 3rd was just okay.  I really hated what they did to the skill trees.  I also felt like the story/environments just weren't as good as the first two.
"Workout songs for people who don't actually work out very often or at all?

No one actually fucking works out to eye of the tiger. [COME ON](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP_9zH9Q44o)."
"Sorry to jump on your comment but I make 5 portions of overnight oats on a Sunday night to do me through the week. My recipe
50g oats
100g Greek yogurt
100ml milk (almond milk also works for taste)
25g nut butter
20ml maple syrup
That comes to around 550kcals, I'm work in recruitment so do long hours and I'm a competitive powerlifter so numbers may need to be adjusted"
