I don't have any complaints on the contrast of the monitor. However, I don't play a lot of dark games or watch movies on it. In general, I would say that the image quality is outstanding and I don't have any complaint. In fact, the only complaint I have about the monitor is the price. They are relatively expensive.",best gaming monitor

51787,"The Apple Leather cases for the iPhone 12 series are shit, and I don't feel comfortable using them. 

They don't *snap* on with their lips like most cases do, and so they come off way, **way** too easily. 

Corners and edges of the phone push out with ease, meaning any drop on the front/corners may be **catastrophic**. The lip of the case doesn't wrap around the corners or edges to offer protection. 

**The Apple Leather case simply doesn't sufficiently hold the phone in.** 

Impact at *any* spot on the front will push the case away and strike the front of the phone. It's like Apple expected the magnet to be sufficient at holding the case on. For general use, it mostly does. It won't help at all if you actually *drop* the phone. 

It offers LESS protection than the previous Apple Leather cases that had open bottoms. Those cases at least had tight lips around each corner that made it impossible for the phone to just **fall** out of the case if dropped. 

I also have the Nomad leather case, which easily provides 100% more protection than the Apple Leather case simply by having a lip that snaps around all corners *and* edges. 

My biggest issue with the Nomad leather case is the buttons. They don't stick out far enough and they just aren't tactile. Mushy, indeed.",best iphone case

His book makes me respect Franklin even more because it shows the type of disrespect she had to deal with from men who were supposed to be her peers. I suppose it was the times, though. 

EDIT: The Dark Lady of DNA by Brenda Maddox is an excellent read and does a great job of showing the hostility Franklin had to deal with in her short life.",best research paper archive

56429,">What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve. It's

I'm actually glad you bought that up because I've seen it mentioned a lot about deep blacks and contrast but then people describe what is simply too high gamma. A calibrated display with a less and 1.0 dE and even curves is similar to how you describe a calibrated G7, not as fun. I've shown people a calibrated displays before and they've said it's washed out...no they're just used to overblown colours or colour boosted in the right areas to give them that pop.

Some content is created unbalanced so a gamma boost can help liven or and in some cases a boosted gamma is in deed fun, despite being a designer in the past, I sometimes like to have the naughty settings turned up, having an OLED with low black setting with content that wasn't mastered with that in mind can look technically crushed in areas but can add a little bit of atmosphere for shits and giggles. The G7 has that out of the box, it what   I would just call tastefully tuned, like the AW2721D is tastefully tuned in it's colour but it has an even gamma. 

I used to be an accuracy whore, my job forced that but now, live and let live, give me those naughty settings but I do like it within reason, none of this 4.0 dE shit.",best desktop monitor
