49029,best gaming monitor,"Pushing 144 fps on a 1660 seems unlikely on many top titles. 

I don't have any complaints on the contrast of the monitor. However, I don't play a lot of dark games or watch movies on it. In general, I would say that the image quality is outstanding and I don't have any complaint. In fact, the only complaint I have about the monitor is the price. They are relatively expensive."

64569,Best Nike running shoes,"If you can get your hands on the new Structure, that would easily be the most comparable thing to the Adrenaline. The Nike React Miler is IMO a criminally underrated (if somewhat boring) shoe that does a really good job blurring the line between neutral and stability. If you have the chance, visit some kind of brick and mortar retailer and try things on before pulling the trigger. Good luck!"

51787,best iphone case,"The Apple Leather cases for the iPhone 12 series are shit, and I don't feel comfortable using them. 

They don't *snap* on with their lips like most cases do, and so they come off way, **way** too easily. 

Corners and edges of the phone push out with ease, meaning any drop on the front/corners may be **catastrophic**. The lip of the case doesn't wrap around the corners or edges to offer protection. 

**The Apple Leather case simply doesn't sufficiently hold the phone in.** 

Impact at *any* spot on the front will push the case away and strike the front of the phone. It's like Apple expected the magnet to be sufficient at holding the case on. For general use, it mostly does. It won't help at all if you actually *drop* the phone. 

It offers LESS protection than the previous Apple Leather cases that had open bottoms. Those cases at least had tight lips around each corner that made it impossible for the phone to just **fall** out of the case if dropped. 

I also have the Nomad leather case, which easily provides 100% more protection than the Apple Leather case simply by having a lip that snaps around all corners *and* edges. 

My biggest issue with the Nomad leather case is the buttons. They don't stick out far enough and they just aren't tactile. Mushy, indeed."

It seems like it might stand up on its own though. Tons of features have been added to do just that."

55465,best action and adventure novel series,"There are 6 books, coupled together as Theft of Swords (1&2), Rise of Empire(3&4), and Heir of Novron(5&6). Each book has its own arc, that the next one builds upon. There are also 3 prequels about Royce and Hadrian's life together before the Revelations series."
13774,best research paper archive,"A great read but, my god, that man is severely misogynistic! One of his main complaints about Franklin is that she was unattractive in his opinion and wasn't flirty. His book makes me respect Franklin even more because it shows the type of disrespect she had to deal with from men who were supposed to be her peers. I suppose it was the times, though. 

EDIT: The Dark Lady of DNA by Brenda Maddox is an excellent read and does a great job of showing the hostility Franklin had to deal with in her short life."

14869,best romantic novel,"First of all, thanks for doing the hard work of compiling this long-running list of nominations and managing the voting process. And secondly, this is amazing! I hope it's going to be a great resource for the subreddit when people ask ""what are the best romances in general?"" And thirdly, holy shit, my nominations are so long-winded that I'm a little embarrassed. But thank you so much for your efforts!"
56429,best desktop monitor,">What makes it seem like it has ""deep blacks"" or a ""contrasty"" look is the default gamma curve. It's

I'm actually glad you bought that up because I've seen it mentioned a lot about deep blacks and contrast but then people describe what is simply too high gamma. A calibrated display with a less and 1.0 dE and even curves is similar to how you describe a calibrated G7, not as fun. I've shown people a calibrated displays before and they've said it's washed out...no they're just used to overblown colours or colour boosted in the right areas to give them that pop.

Some content is created unbalanced so a gamma boost can help liven or and in some cases a boosted gamma is in deed fun, despite being a designer in the past, I sometimes like to have the naughty settings turned up, having an OLED with low black setting with content that wasn't mastered with that in mind can look technically crushed in areas but can add a little bit of atmosphere for shits and giggles. The G7 has that out of the box, it what   I would just call tastefully tuned, like the AW2721D is tastefully tuned in it's colour but it has an even gamma. 

I used to be an accuracy whore, my job forced that but now, live and let live, give me those naughty settings but I do like it within reason, none of this 4.0 dE shit."

46958,best hand santizer brand,"Soap will definitely kill things. It's not going to do the most thorough job of it, but it still acts as any other detergent and destroys cell membranes by pretty much the exact property you described (as the phospholipids in the membrane are amphoteric). Killing bacteria isn't generally the main purpose of washing with soap and water, but it definitely happens."
