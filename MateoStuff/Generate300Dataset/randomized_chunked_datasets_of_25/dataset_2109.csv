32483,"I like to read the one star reviews and tend to ignore the best ones as they all either love it and repeat themselves, or are complete shills.

The negative review (1 and 2 stars) tend to be a little more specific. Many of them are such minor inconveniences that even if they were by a corporate shills, it would be hard to believe that it might ever really deter anyone from staying there.

But on the other hand, if you repeatedly read one complaint that is crucial and stated again and again, it is worth taking note of, and possibly avoiding that location all together.

Also, this sucks to say, but honestly, the more money you spend, the better chance you're going to get exactly what you wanted. These expensive resorts and hotels don't stay in business if high paying clientele hate it and refuse to come back. They keep their high rating and prices high because there is a demand for that type or location and they deliver on a consistent basis.

Not only does it talk about various forms of time management (and what is the best) it talks about everything else you need to know about personal change.

Though the time management part comes somewhere in the middle of the book, the rest of the book should be read as it lays a very good foundation for it.

In short: Its not really about managing time, but managing priorities.

Highly recommend.",best books for time management reddit

Since I am Danish and I use those characters everyday when talking to family/friends or when using the internet it would not be a good idea for to buy a US English layout board just for a different kind of switch. I am moving back to Denmark at the end of April so I will check and see if they have anything there when get settled in back home. But given how hard it is to find anything other than a Razer or a Cherry Switch on a Danish Mechanical Keyboard I think it would be unlikely they would have any.",best keyboard switches
8793,"No idea why this is being downvoted, it's a valid question.

The real answer though, is that regardless of whether its good or bad, what it certainly is is ***useless***. Charcoal does not work the way people think it does, and the way marketing teams want people to think it does. What it can do, if implemented incorrectly, though, is act as an abrasive, and damage your teeth. As such, I would recommend you avoid it, along with any whitening toothpaste, [which are far TOO abrasive](https://preview.redd.it/5t02mtxz4r161.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f6906fe985cbb23c34f3d27e781fe565cda7fb0).",best toothpaste
