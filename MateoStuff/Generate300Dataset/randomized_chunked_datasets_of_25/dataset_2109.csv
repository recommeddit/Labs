47521,best state to visit in the United States,"I've only ever gone to Orlando Florida but still the best holiday I've ever hsd. From tickets to evrry single theme park, fast passes, overnight hotels. The Manor we stayed in was fucking gorgeous, we had a really nice rental car. Food was great. I did not know that ice cube machines existed and dispensers scared the shit out of me at first but yeah. 10/10 going back this year."

23849,best car racing video game,"Rush Rally 3 you can adjust different parts of your car to adjust how it drives, and can also customise the paint work of the cars (not just colour, but you can add and make patterns and logos). It also has brilliant gameplay, and requires winning races and tournaments to save up for the better cars."
18186,best YouTube video,"Shame they’re not too good anymore. They’re still good but a couple years ago each video was so good (College Photoshop class, Scott Sterling, Murder Mystery-dinner, and so many more)"
46707,best hand santizer brand,Costco near me and they had gallon sized germ x (only 62% but supposedly effective enough) for like $15 each. CVS near me also had liter sized bottles for $8. But maybe that's just my state where there's a little lull.

65983,best college in california,"Don't really know where you are getting this from, I would say I was maybe in the top 35% of students for my graduating year and still got into a UC for Organic Chemistry. Out of state students are maybe like 30% and are all wonderful people"
63763,best books for building better habits reddit,"I've tried mushrooms about 5 times or so, and each was a great experience (including one where it was a 'bad trip' for part of it). I've been offered Ayahuasca but was too afraid of it at the time. Do you mind if I ask what your own personal experience was? I've read about many scientists using LSD.. also read a lot about DMT... just wondering your own thoughts on the matter."

42362,movies like Inception,I HATE THIS ENDING.  I read the book and was destroyed after the movie.  I guess that was the plan.
32483,best vacation resort,"I like to read the one star reviews and tend to ignore the best ones as they all either love it and repeat themselves, or are complete shills.

The negative review (1 and 2 stars) tend to be a little more specific. Many of them are such minor inconveniences that even if they were by a corporate shills, it would be hard to believe that it might ever really deter anyone from staying there.

But on the other hand, if you repeatedly read one complaint that is crucial and stated again and again, it is worth taking note of, and possibly avoiding that location all together.

Also, this sucks to say, but honestly, the more money you spend, the better chance you're going to get exactly what you wanted. These expensive resorts and hotels don't stay in business if high paying clientele hate it and refuse to come back. They keep their high rating and prices high because there is a demand for that type or location and they deliver on a consistent basis. 

TL;DR: be rich"

63653,best books for time management reddit,"The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen R. Covey


Not only does it talk about various forms of time management (and what is the best) it talks about everything else you need to know about personal change.

Though the time management part comes somewhere in the middle of the book, the rest of the book should be read as it lays a very good foundation for it.

In short: Its not really about managing time, but managing priorities.

Highly recommend."
68483,best science fiction novel,I have the exact same review for Dune.
45703,best trick or treating candy,"B-but.. but candy corn is delicious!  Best kind of candy ever. I never knew so many people hated it, my family always loved it. I can never quite figure out what that taste is though, its definitly unique."
72446,best keyboard switches,"I would like to try some of those by I do not know of any company that makes either of switches on a Danish Keyboard (one with æ, ø, å). Since I am Danish and I use those characters everyday when talking to family/friends or when using the internet it would not be a good idea for to buy a US English layout board just for a different kind of switch. I am moving back to Denmark at the end of April so I will check and see if they have anything there when get settled in back home. But given how hard it is to find anything other than a Razer or a Cherry Switch on a Danish Mechanical Keyboard I think it would be unlikely they would have any."
8793,best toothpaste,"No idea why this is being downvoted, it's a valid question.

The real answer though, is that regardless of whether its good or bad, what it certainly is is ***useless***. Charcoal does not work the way people think it does, and the way marketing teams want people to think it does. What it can do, if implemented incorrectly, though, is act as an abrasive, and damage your teeth. As such, I would recommend you avoid it, along with any whitening toothpaste, [which are far TOO abrasive](https://preview.redd.it/5t02mtxz4r161.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f6906fe985cbb23c34f3d27e781fe565cda7fb0)."
