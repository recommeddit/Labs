"This is what worked for my wife.  Just get her out of the house and let her know you can take control of the kid situation.  Let her shop, get her hair done, go out with friends, whatever it is you think she'll enjoy the most.  But most importantly, you take the kids and just deal with whatever comes up without calling.

"We have a lot of homes in our area that have well water and there is a lab right in town where we can drop off a water sample. If you live somewhere more urban check your local listings for ""water testing"" they'll send you a container in which to return the water. The cost is pretty reasonable."
"Never heard of Pitt before this post. Didn't even know it was based on a book.

But that movie was fun as fuck and exemplifies action/adventure."
"Villa Manzu - but if you don’t have a lot of friends or family to share it with, Nayara Springs has some nice stuff. Pair it w the Four Seasons. Or give it another year or two and there are some cool resorts in the pipeline here."
Seattle is an interesting spot.

"I'm a guitarist and drummer, but man do I wish I sat down and really learned how to play the piano. That was my first instrument when I was 6 but I never stuck to it, and only played by ear with no theory or more technical hand independence. Recently i've been trying, and i'll keep trying, but this is tough."
"a quadlock. if you need to put it on a hadlebar or mirror of a motorbike, it’s perfect."
"This is probably the best answer. You actually do have to drive the same cars for a while and upgrade them. You can also build more towards sturdiness at the cost of speed, or the other way around."
