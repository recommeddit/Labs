"Lowe's for me. Girlfriend works at Lowe's corporate, so any mention of the orange store is heresy. And I'm a veteran, and they give 10% off up to $500 per day for all active or prior military. 

I used to be a home depot guy, but the home depots here in Charlotte, especially up in concord where I live, are pretty shit since we're like 20 minutes away from Lowe's corporate."
"It's got it's lines in it that do legit pump you up. There's ""how could I make a man out of you?"" and if you happen to have just failed out a set or something, that's a good ""I'll show you!"" moment. And then there's a line that's similar to ""Harder, better, faster, stronger"" that goes ""We must be swift as the coursing river (Chorus yelling ""BE A MAN!"") With all the force of a great typhoon (BE A MAN!) With all the strength of a raging fire!"" I like to time my sets along with the chorus of songs and pump up lines in general, so this one does work really well. Nothing like being told to be a man when I'm about to putter out."
Have a cleaning company come in. Best treat ever. I love it when my husband surprises me with a spotless house!
"Industry. Standard.

That is far more important than being the best for professional clout.  Excel is the industry standard."
Grammarly is amazing!
Clear and Vivid with Alan Alda is great!

The fact that people are mentioning anyone other than Brady is asinine. The greatest player of all time at the most important position.
"Charles Barkley. Nice guy, got a picture with him... I even unprovoked touched his bicep (for some apparent reason) and he just laughed at me. (I was also 11)
 
Al Gore when he was Vice-president. Not so much his secret service.... He was out jogging. He actually stopped to talk to us in our car and took our address. He sent us an autographed picture to me and my sister.
 
George W. Bush. I just got to shake his hand, but it was a firm handshake and he seemed to be a solid guy."
Thanks for the tip! I'm definitely going to try it!
">I think most people only eat breakfast if their wife or mother makes it for them.

College man here. I can confirm no one eats breakfast."
"I would recommend the iPhone 11. Way better cameras and it’ll be supported for longer than the XR. The XR isn’t a bad phone, but I’d recommend the iPhone 11 unless you don’t care about cameras. Apple really improved in the photography area from the jump between the XR and iPhone 11. The XR’s camera is okay/average, IMO. Not “bad,” but it can’t compete with the iPhone 11’s."
I’ve never heard of either of those
"I really loved Nashville. Was only there for four days, but I saw 3 concerts, more music in bars, ate amazing food, went on a cave tour about 2 hours away, met some great people. It’s just a beautiful city and a perfect getaway. I was there in October and the weather was perfect."
"Mado, I love Turkish ice cream!"

Cookies and cream. You can never fail with cookies and cream
"Just because I use rym, that doesn't mean I agree with their top 10s, lol."
"Absolutely. Anyone studying a language should learn something substantial in addition. I have a degree in journalism but every job I have ever had (journalism, research, marketing etc) , I got because I one-upped other applicants with my language skills. I didn't need a degree in a language but granted, my background enabled me to learn languages as part of my life.


If you really wanna learn a language and study the culture, history etc, you should also look into acquiring additional skills and experience in other fields."
"uOrigin is not as good as before, more ADs and redirects have been happening lately"
