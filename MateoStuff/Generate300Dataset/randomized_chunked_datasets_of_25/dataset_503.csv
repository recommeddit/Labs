17031,best iOS game,"Northgard looks like a game that will become very copy/paste in a randomly generated world. The bit that I’ve read about it made me think that each clan has a very specific way to play and once you figure out their efficiencies, it’s very monotonous. Right or wrong?"

64126,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,The thing is Tachiyomi and most downloaders have single chapters available. I have a Kindle that I want to use and I have to convert every single chapter for it. That's why I was wondering if any site hosted complete volumes so I don't have to convert as much

2378,best headphones,Can confirm the btr5 with my hifiman he4xx is FAR better than any Bluetooth headphones ive heard. I usually just run the cable under my shirt and stick it in my pocket. As far as “conversion” you just make sure the battery is charged and the device is connected to your source and you plug your headphones in. Thats it. The btr5 comes with a little case with a clip on it so you can also clip it to a belt or your pants or whatever

Situations like yours are one of the reasons the sub exists.  Nice bunch of people who like playing Santa. And many of the recipients return to pay it forward when their finances are in better shape, so don't feel bad about asking for help."

54504,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hey, first of all huge thanks for your commitment to the community.
Shidenkai question here.
I've had Shidenkai mid for half a year now, put lexip's ceramic feet on my mice and now the pad's speed has become significantly slower. I used it with care, even put it away for surfing or working and used just for gaming. Now the glide is smooth as usual but definately slow.
Even applying pledge polish now doesn't give that same effect as it did in the beginning.
Maybe its the ceramic feet that weared out the glass coating over time? Or maybe i didn't make a proper clean of the pad from the collected skin sweat. I usualy clean it with monitor cleaning spray and a microfibre cloth."

35151,best NFL player,"I'm not 100% on that, but I know they do it before the playoffs. I know November was tossed around a ton back when Lamar won it in 2020. It was a huge deal to some people that Mahomes wasn't 1 and the explanation provided was they vote in November (cannot confirm), but definitely before playoffs."
