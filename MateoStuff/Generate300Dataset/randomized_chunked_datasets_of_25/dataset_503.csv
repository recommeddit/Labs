2378,Can confirm the btr5 with my hifiman he4xx is FAR better than any Bluetooth headphones ive heard. I usually just run the cable under my shirt and stick it in my pocket. As far as “conversion” you just make sure the battery is charged and the device is connected to your source and you plug your headphones in. Thats it. The btr5 comes with a little case with a clip on it so you can also clip it to a belt or your pants or whatever,best headphones

Shidenkai question here.
I've had Shidenkai mid for half a year now, put lexip's ceramic feet on my mice and now the pad's speed has become significantly slower. I used it with care, even put it away for surfing or working and used just for gaming. Now the glide is smooth as usual but definately slow.
Even applying pledge polish now doesn't give that same effect as it did in the beginning.
Maybe its the ceramic feet that weared out the glass coating over time? Or maybe i didn't make a proper clean of the pad from the collected skin sweat. I usualy clean it with monitor cleaning spray and a microfibre cloth.",best artisan mousepad alternatives
