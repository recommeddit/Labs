9627,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I was in Manzanita for 2 quarters and didn't like it. I mean the room was cool, the dining commons was good, but people weren't very social. Mostly creepy actually. My own room mate wasn't social at all. I was a transfer but he was a 4th year that lived in the dorms all four years. I moved out to IV after 2 quarters and loved it but I would choose one of the other dorms."

32572,best vacation resort,"I may have brought this up in another thread, but consider a non-all inclusive.  I have been going to Cancun for many years, and the all inclusive resorts have been killing off the local restaurants and cultural offerings.  Not to mention, the way many of these resorts offer such low cost, is paying their employees absolute crap and cutting corners on amenities, often times to make up for a bad week, month or quarter.   It's really sad actually."
