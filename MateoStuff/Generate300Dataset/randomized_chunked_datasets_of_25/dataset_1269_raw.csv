"Since you know python i suggest to start with Django, search it in lynda, and make a barebones login/logout with text. Then connect the users and display that connection. Then make your quest account. 

Generally worry about css/js last, first do the backend

Also don't use Dreamweaver, use Atom / Visual Studio Code / Sublime

I suggest to use PyCharm (for python) & WebStorm (for html/css/js) JetBrains provide free software to students."

Also play Royal version of persona 5

"When I was in Denmark and Faroe we would pre drink at an apartment starting around 10 and take a bus downtown around 2-3 am, stay downtown until 7 or 8 and then go to a morning party where most people end up finding a couch or bed somewhere to sleep on most of the day, a bit crazy haha"

"From Dusk to Dawn is a pretty big plot twist, as in the plot completely changes into a new movie halfway through."
"Re-reading that right now. I love how it's bordering on the fantastically surreal in so many places, but always with just enough foundation to remain believable.

(Did I just say Foundation? Pure coincidence. Very different series, also great.)"
