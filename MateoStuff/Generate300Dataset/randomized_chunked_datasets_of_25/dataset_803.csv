60269,"It'll be almost impossible to find a chest freezer that will last you for life at this time.  Almost all consumer chest freezers from the major manufacturers (Frigidaire and GE are the big names in the game right now) are made at the same factory in China.  You can expect about 10 years of service from them on the high side, 5 on the low.

It sucks, but unless you look commercial, you'll have a tough time finding anything consumer line that will fit the bill.

32271,"Mattresses can range from the couple hundred dollars to 10k for the most part. And the higher cost doesnt mean better quality. 

I work in furniture repair and go out and do mattress inspections for warranty defects. The average price range would be somewhere around 3k. And that is pretty much middle of the road in the matt world. 

It's a hit and miss world. You would think Tempur-Pedic would be the end all be all of Matt's. It's a love it or absolutely hate it product. No middle ground and its 50/50 whether people like it long term or not. People fall in love with purple in the show room, drop 3k for one and then want it out of their house within a month. 

And I always get the well we spent 5k we thought we wouldn't have any problems and I am like cost doesnt matter its luck of the draw for the most part. You can get the same matt 10 times and 5 out of those 10 times it turns into a shitty matt the other 5 it works out and remains comfortable. 

Just use and remember your warranty.",best hotel to live in

Every year approximately 30,000 New Zealanders who were born in NZ leave NZ to try and have a better life in Australia.  Whenever I see NZ mentioned in these threads, I assume the person recommending it doesn’t really understand the very limited opportunities there.
