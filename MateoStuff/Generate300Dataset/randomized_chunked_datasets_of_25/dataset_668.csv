I just posted this comment and auto-moderator immediately notified me with a message that Ann Leckie will be doing an AMA. Is this accidental or deliberate? **Is that why her book is somehow miraculously at the no.1 spot above countless classics??**. Because the list is just another form of shameless promotion like we're overfed in r/books with countless pop-productions such as the Martian, Ready Player One and other ""brilliant"" stuff?

 Yeah.... wouldn't be the first time eddit would allow for astroturfing in all form would it now...

My original comment below. Kind of takes a different shape now....

Edit2: I just got two more notifications. Someone is pushing this AMA really hard...

This is going to be the sarcastic, complaining/ranting comment that expresses distaste at those anonymous stupid lists of irrelevant stuff that are all over the internet. Consider yourself warned.

 That looks to me like the standard reddit list ""here are the books I read and liked but let's pretend like they are some universally recognized classics. Typical work of an armchair sci-fi expert.  At the same time so many things which genuinely warrant your attention and time are missing here.... Sigh.  

Genuine ""you should definitely read because it's a classic"" in **bold**. Genuine ""you should definitely read because it's mindblowing"" in *italics*. Rest is just yet another book which you can read or not...if you don't nothing really happens.

Ancillary Justice   (wtf is *that* at no. 1 spot?)       
**Starship Troopers**     
**Neuromancer**     
John Dies at the End     
**War of the Worlds**    
Eisenhorn        
*Blindsight*        
**Ender’s Game** (obligatory Speaker of the Dead)     
**Dune** (obligatory first four books to Emperor of Dune)    
Redshirts: A Novel With Three Codas    
**The Hyperion Cantos**    
**The Forever War**    
Seveneves     
**Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?**    
*Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*     
   
The Guide is a classic but hardly a proper *sci-fi* classic - it's more of an absurdist comedy thing but it's mindblowing anyway and it's a literary classic in its own right.

Notice that with the ""read or not"" books there's exactly 10 positions on the list - which is better just as 10 commandments is better than 15.  

Good strong list (although with some important books still missing) and not diluted with derivatives or irrelevant positions."

64815,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"I like Mony's. Nearby and also good is Shalhoob. 

I didn't see anyone post it, but somewhat underrated is taqueria El bajio. Get a torta if you go there. 

There was a recent post where someone gave a fantastic list for the santa ynez valley if you're going to make it up there.

34167,best NFL player,"John Madden said any position.[I have proof of QB](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4omCZa31d3w) also [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AobfjXLlzRI) has Mike Ditka making the claim that he could play any position, blocking, kicking, tackling, catching. Whatever he needed to do. At one point he even said that he was glad he got to go to the Bears, because a team like the Steelers would have forced him into specialization."

6911,best iPhone,"I was a sales rep at T-Mobile when those came out and as far as I could tell, the c stood for children. Parents would always buy that one for their kids because of the price and then they got to choose some ugly colors.


Also I’ll vote for the iPhone 6 which I just replaced the other week for the new SE. that phone had the best value I’ve ever known in a phone given the years I had it."

52552,best hiphop album,"It was a great time in hip hop.

I'll throw in my support for Nas' next album 'It Was Written'.
Some think the beats are too 'pop', but Nas was more confident in this album.  Some real classics on there."
60280,best freezer brand,"They use more energy, and I *believe* the are less reliable, but you might want to look into that. Mine is not frost free and I never have any issues with frosty food, especially since I vacuum seal everything. Maybe once every few years I'll empty everything and do a complete defrost though as it can build up a bit over time."
14765,best romantic novel,I had a slightly different take - the writing was great but geez her characters were not good. That was a terrible heroine.
34504,best NFL player,Connor Barwin is such a huge hipster. It's incredible to witness the first time you meet the guy.

15121,best tree for the garden,I can't imagine any home grower is going to go through the immense work to make sunflower butter from seeds. It's like $3 a jar for more than you'd get from five hours of shucking seeds by hand.
