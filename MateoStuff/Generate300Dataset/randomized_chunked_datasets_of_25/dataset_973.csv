25726,"I reckon England’s would look something like this

1. Hobbs
2. Sutcliffe
3. Hutton
4. Barrington
5. Hammond
6. Botham
7. Knott
8. Trueman
9. Laker
10. Tyson
11. Barnes

Some people in this thread seem to find it hard to believe that England could be ranked highly in an all time XI, but I think England could put up an argument for 3rd behind Australia and the West Indies. And whilst there’s no right or wrong answers in a hypothetical match up between highly debatable sides containing players from vastly different eras who played under different rules, I do find it odd that England is dismissed so easily.

Opening the batting for England you have Hobbs and Sutcliffe, whilst a few select opening pairings have gone past this pair in overall volume of runs, none have come close to their average opening partnership stand of 87.81. To put that into perspective Greenidge and Haynes as a partnership averaged 47.31 and Hayden and Langer averaged 51.88, and these are two of the greatest opening partnerships of all time. 

Talking about them individually Herbert Sutcliffe has the third highest average of anyone in test cricket to have played more than 50 innings with an average of 60.73, and so was clearly some player. Likewise, Jack Hobbs was an exceptional player who averaged 56.94 and was referred to as ‘the master’, such was the esteem he was held in. Moreover, Hobbes was one of Wisdens 5 cricketers of the century, showing just how highly many people still rate him.

At number 3 is Len Hutton. Whilst he was an opener in real life in order not to break up this team he is bumped down to number 3. In a career interrupted and affected by World War Two (He seriously injures his arm in commando training and it never fully recovered) he did not allow this to stop him scoring nearly 7000 runs at an average of 56.67.

Coming in at number 4 is perhaps England’s greatest batsmen to have only played post-1945, Ken Barrington. Barrington was the ultimate big occasion player, with his average increasing with every level of increase in the standard of the opposition. Barrington was often a slow scorer who could hold a side together, and given the more exciting stroke players around him I think this would work well. Furthermore, whilst he averaged a very respectable 50.71 in home test, he averaged 69.18 in away tests, showing that he was no home wicket bully and could adapt to more foreign conditions brilliantly.

In stark contrast to Barrington at 4, Wally Hammond was an exciting and attacking batsmen who was often described as majestic by those who saw him play. With an average of 58.45 and 7,249 runs in Test Cricket, a record total that stood for over 30 years, he was clearly not just a cavalier shot maker though, but someone who accumulated runs quickly and in great numbers. On top of his batting ability Hammond was an exceptional fielder and a talented, if reluctant, bowler. Once again this would help with the adaptability of this side.

At number 6 I’ve gone for another shot maker in the form of all rounder Ian Botham. I think it’s important to remember when talking about Botham that there are two halves to his career, Ian Botham the cricket and Ian Botham the celebrity (who happened to be good at cricket. At his best Ian Botham was one of few genuine all founders the game has ever seen, in that he would have got into the side on the strength of either skill, it didn’t hurt either that he was a great slip fielder. Most importantly Botham was a match winner with either bat or ball, rather than just someone who could contribute solid numbers. He had taken 200 wickets by just his 41st match, and had etched his name in cricketing folklore with his heroics in the 1981 ashes, forever to be remembered as Botham’s ashes. And whilst in later years his body shape might have more resembled that of the ball than that of a professional sportsman, this didn’t stop him becoming the all time leading test wicket taker with 383 wickets, whilst also scoring 5,200 runs and 14 centuries.

At 7 I’ve gone for Alan Knott. Perhaps the greatest glove man the game has ever seen, and certainly one of the most eccentric. Considering the bowling talent this team posses, it is crucial to have a wicket taker who can take all the chances offered, be they catches or stumpings. Whilst it will always be for his keeping ability that he is remembered, Knott was also a solid batsmen, averaging 32.75, which is certainly very handy for a keeper of his ability.

At number 8 I’ve gone for Fred Trueman. Whilst fiery Fred might be batting a place too high, hopefully the batting talent already in the line up can ensure that this isn’t a major problem, although he could be a useful late order batsmen when he put his mind too it. Similarly to other players in this team, Trueman was also an excellent fielder, and so a keeper and slip combination of Knott, Hammond, Botham and Trueman wouldn’t be putting many chances down. But rather than catching edges it was for his ability in finding them that he gets into this team. Capable of bowling fast, and being able to combine it with the skill to swing it both ways, Trueman was an exceptional bowler, as his stats back up. 307 test wickets (again a record at the time) at an average of 21.57 show just how talented a bowler he was. This is reinforced by the fact that out of the 9 bowlers since to have claimed the record of most test wickets, none have done so at a lower average.

Coming in at number 9 I’ve gone for England’s greatest spinner and the man who still holds the record for the best figures in a match with 19-90, Jim Laker. Laker though was far more than a one match phenomenon though, as his 193 wickets at 21.24 apiece show. Laker was held in such high regard that the great Gary Sobers called him the greatest off spinner he had ever seen.

At 10 I’ve gone for Frank Tyson. If Trueman was fast then Typhoon Tyson was faster. With a claim to being the fastest bowler the game has ever seen (a claim backed up by Bradman and Benaud), Tyson offers great variety from the other bowlers on display. The ability to intimidate the opposition batsmen through sheer speed and ferocity, and with a vicious bumper always lurking, Tyson would mesh well with the more swing orientated bowlers already in the team. And whilst bowling so fast had a massive impact on his body, it had an even bigger impact on the opposition. Whilst he only took 76 wickets in his career, they came at 18.56 per wicket, this is a low record than anyone who has taken 20 or more wickets has managed since.

The final player in my starting XI is Sydney Barnes. The earliest player on this list, he still holds the record for the most wickets taken in a series with 49. Overall his 189 wickets (again a world record at the time) came at just 16.43 a wicket, the lowest of anyone to have played their entire test career in the 20th century.",best cricket teams of all time
