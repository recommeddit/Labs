52383,best hiphop album,Lmao I assumed it was OPs because everyone who uses RYM has that same damn list
42839,best detective show,Mindhunter was really really good. That show stayed with me for a long time after it was over. I wish it wasnâ€™t cancelled! I wanted to know what was going to happen with the detectiveâ€™s adopted son.
70649,best movies with a cool twist,"Oldboy is one of my favorites, but a lot of people I recommend it to just donâ€™t understand it or are a little disturbed by the recommendation. They donâ€™t understand that itâ€™s suppose to make you hate the villain, not the movie. Yes itâ€™s sick and twisted, but it was all orchestrated by a man."

Maybe this answer is a little tacky, but damn if it doesn't hype me up lol"

57923,best cologne,"As nice as Aqua Di Gio is, its the worlds most popular mens cologne, sot unless you want to smell like the masses, leave it alone. Cool Water by Davidoff is great too, but unfortunately has gone a bit the same way. Armani Code is nice, Versace Man is good too. Currently I'm on Hypnose by Lancome and loving it. Got some POWER by 50 Cent on the way soon from a friend in the USA :)

I find with colognes its best to buy smaller bottles, and constantly rotate. I haven't yet bought a second bottle of any cologne; I like moving on and finding awesome new scents."
37078,best amusement park,One that I haven't seen mentioned is if you want to combine rides and beach you could check out Morey's Pier in Wildwood NJ. A trio of neighboring piers built off the boardwalk with a handful of coasters including a nice super old school wooden one that goes out over the beach. Plus some good water park sections and you're at the damn beach! A longer drive than say Ocean City but about the same as VA Beach so worth thinking of.
71342,best movies with a cool twist,"The ones I remember most: 

A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) (The Uninvited (2009), a US remake, isn't that bad at all.) 

Oldboy (2003) 

Right at Your Door (2006), April Fool's Day (1986), The Ninth Configuration (1980), Arlington Road (1999), Frailty (2001), Identity (2003), and No Way Out (1987) -- I knew nothing about those movies when they showed up on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Same with Dead Man's Shoes (2004) I suspected half way through, but it still managed to take me by surprise, anyway. 

Mindhunters (2004) shouldn't be counted here as it's a whodunit, but I'm listing it here for those who enjoy guessing who might be behind it."
42512,best detective show,"Bendadit Cucumberpatch ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ But I have to agree, it's a really good tv show!!"
56672,best desktop monitor,got the parts to build i5-8400 and 1060 6gb system. i pretty much just play overwatch. best monitor for my situation?
41327,best instrument to play,"The Organ. If it is a big one there is no limit to the sounds that you can get out of it, I am thinking monstrous great romantic organs like the one in saint-sulpice in Paris. It can be so loud that the floor shakes or so quiet that you can barely hear it. So high that it is only a squeak or so low that you cannot hear it at all except for a deep bass rumble on the edge of hearing. Also the separated manuals gives you huge flexibility in the way that you combine sounds and then slowly add them in over the course of the piece. [Widor's sixth symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rizCafG_ou8) is a real example of this."

22262,best celebrity,"Ran into two local sports stars. Chris Anderson (Birdman) from the Denver Nuggets. He shook my little boys hands and was just an awesome dude.    
Ed Macaffrey from the Broncos held the door for my pregnant wife at a book store. Shook my hand and, very genuinely, said ""Congratulations!""."
64651,Best Nike running shoes,"Seeing as you are a beginner thesell really help they have a nice support but arent too heavy, they are decent when running under 30km per week. I dont reccomend running any more than 20km in one go in them because then they start to hurt"

35609,best alcoholic drink,"NyQuil has acetaminophen in it. Acetaminophen is **hepatotoxic** (toxic to the liver) if you:

- take too much

- combine it with alcohol

It sounds like you're doing what you can to accelerate liver cirrhosis. Hell, even taking too much acetaminophen alone can cause liver failure within days."

63026,Best online React course,"\+100 for Wes Bos. Even if you do other tutorials, his courses are great overviews and refreshers.
