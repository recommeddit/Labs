They donâ€™t understand that itâ€™s suppose to make you hate the villain, not the movie. Yes itâ€™s sick and twisted, but it was all orchestrated by a man.",best movies with a cool twist

57923,"As nice as Aqua Di Gio is, its the worlds most popular mens cologne, sot unless you want to smell like the masses, leave it alone. Cool Water by Davidoff is great too, but unfortunately has gone a bit the same way. Armani Code is nice, Versace Man is good too. Currently I'm on Hypnose by Lancome and loving it. Got some POWER by 50 Cent on the way soon from a friend in the USA :)

I find with colognes its best to buy smaller bottles, and constantly rotate. I haven't yet bought a second bottle of any cologne; I like moving on and finding awesome new scents.",best cologne
37078,One that I haven't seen mentioned is if you want to combine rides and beach you could check out Morey's Pier in Wildwood NJ. A trio of neighboring piers built off the boardwalk with a handful of coasters including a nice super old school wooden one that goes out over the beach. Plus some good water park sections and you're at the damn beach! A longer drive than say Ocean City but about the same as VA Beach so worth thinking of.,best amusement park
71342,"The ones I remember most: 

A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) (The Uninvited (2009), a US remake, isn't that bad at all.) 

Oldboy (2003) 

Right at Your Door (2006), April Fool's Day (1986), The Ninth Configuration (1980), Arlington Road (1999), Frailty (2001), Identity (2003), and No Way Out (1987) -- I knew nothing about those movies when they showed up on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Same with Dead Man's Shoes (2004) I suspected half way through, but it still managed to take me by surprise, anyway. 

Mindhunters (2004) shouldn't be counted here as it's a whodunit, but I'm listing it here for those who enjoy guessing who might be behind it.",best movies with a cool twist

41327,"The Organ. If it is a big one there is no limit to the sounds that you can get out of it, I am thinking monstrous great romantic organs like the one in saint-sulpice in Paris. It can be so loud that the floor shakes or so quiet that you can barely hear it. So high that it is only a squeak or so low that you cannot hear it at all except for a deep bass rumble on the edge of hearing. Also the separated manuals gives you huge flexibility in the way that you combine sounds and then slowly add them in over the course of the piece. [Widor's sixth symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rizCafG_ou8) is a real example of this.",best instrument to play
