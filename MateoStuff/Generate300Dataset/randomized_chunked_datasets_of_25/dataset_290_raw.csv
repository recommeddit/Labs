Your username sounds tasty. That’s all.

"LOL. I'm Asian too. Funnily enough, I rejected all of the UCs for Cal Poly SLO. They can suck it, at least for undergrad."

but people have like...

opinions.

&#x200B;

Yeah, and sometimes they're different.

&#x200B;

Crazy.

Personally I love Thor 1 and Black Panther and see them as structurally similar. The MCU has been returning to phase one films for structure for awhile. They used Iron Man a lot, and in my opinion that wasn't very successful - it gave us Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, which were kinda flaccid without RDJ's charm and the political commentary of the original. THOR's structure, however, has proven more versatile. It's given us Black Panther, Ragnarok, and Captain Marvel, which I enjoyed far more. There's more room to play with it, too."
"You could disagree, but science proves it.

RO water lacks the minerals that help carry flavour through. 

Prof. Chris Hendon and Maxwell Collonna-Dashwood even wrote a whole book based in their research on the interactions of minerals in water and which flavours they bring. [Here’s a short summary of their book](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jf501687c)

As a professional cupper, I can vouch that. Even [SCA Cupping Protocols and Golden Cup Standard](https://sca.coffee/research/coffee-standards) call for water with some minerals in them. 

You may enjoy flat tasting coffee, that’s definitely to each of their own. But you’re not giving your coffee a chance to shine either by not allowing their flavours to come through."
"yeah, I don't think it's a perfect situation, but I'm not too bothered by the fact that I take a recyclable bottle with me sometimes when I'm out and about instead of remembering to fill my nalgene."
"Can confirm, had a stash of skol and many trips to the dormitory vending machine...

I wisened up by second semester and explored campus town, found a knockoff Dollar General store and landed myself a new favorite: Mountain Thunder. More sugar than Mtn Dew but only $0.68 for 2 liters."
"My point exactly! There's no climb, no progression, just pandering. I recently tried Forza Motorsport 7 and i straight up had a supercar from the beginning, even though i couldn't drive it, it was so weird."
Churchill?
I am so sorry. Go this month! Its never too late to trick or treat.
"Aye, you're absolutely correct. I don't see Fargo as representative of the entire country, of course. But some of the things that bother me often apply to a country in its entirety, such as the (federal) political environment and laws in the US, the climate in Iceland, or the relative lack (or high cost) of craft beer in Australia.

I know I'm just nitpicking here, though. I'm sure I could be extremely happy in any of these countries, as long as (as you mentioned) the city is the right one."

"In Texas it’s taught pretty plainly. We won our revolution and were our own nation for 10 years but then we couldn’t decide on where the border should be. Mexico wanted it on the Brazos River, we wanted it on the Rio Grande. We already asked to be part of the US when we won the rev but they said no then 10 years later they annexed us because manifest destiny essentially and put troops along what was essentially no mans land, then there was a squabble between troops and a war started and the US marched all the way down to Mexico City where Mexico surrendered all of that land"
