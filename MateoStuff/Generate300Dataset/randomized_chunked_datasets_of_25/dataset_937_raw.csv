My most complimented scent is...my hair gel. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I grew up twenty miles from Kings Island and as a kid I assumed everyone had a park like that close to home. I realized later how lucky I was. I had opening day rides on Flight of Fear and Son of Beast, I doubt I'd even be an enthusiast if it weren't for living so close"
"I've personally have only seen Jager-bombs as shots of Jager dropped into a glass of Red Bull - shot glass and all, rather than 50/50."
I might give Fire Red a try then
"Bottled rains that have been blessed down on Africa, or Aquafina."
You‚Äôre right. Typo.
"Yep, Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo is epic! Same with The Three Musketeers."
Zicam is homeopathic. Don't use Zicam.
I am from Greece and they did not answer to my email for a month and then it took another month to the process moving. To each their own. I am not touching another Logitech product until they address the switch issues they have with their models.

"Rowan Atkinson and his family were in the same heli-ski group as me and my family in Chamonix, France. (It was a private group company, but the guide we hired had a pretty bad injury, so they had to join groups.) My family was really excited, as we all really love Blackadder, Thin Blue Line, Mr.Bean, etc. When he, his wife, his daughter and my family first met up, we introduced ourselves as huge fans of his, and if he would mind if we got his autograph. He said he'd do us one better, and take us out to dinner after we finished skiing.

That was the funniest dinner I've ever had.

**tldr;** Went skiing with Mr.Bean in France and he took my family out to dinner afterwords."
"Oboe, ""I believe I can fly"", R. Kelly...space jam, that is all."
The spore thing is more important here than nooks and crannies. Killing anything that can't create spores means the next gen will be spore producers. Meaning you'll kill the parents only to get a bunch  of offspring all over again.
"Went for almost two years without a decent job interview.  I had a lot of experience as a retired soldier and contractor, but no degree.  When my contract went away due to budget cuts, I couldn't buy a job interview.  Within one month of finishing my degree, I had three solid job offers, all within my field.  

Edit:  I did learn quite a bit, and felt that the classes were academically challenging as well as current.  Looking forward now to starting and completing my Master's degree."
"Alexa, tell me when that person talks."
"Many alternative milks made from soy, almond, coconut, hazelnut, oat, hemp.  Also creamers if you like something thicker--soy, almond, coconut being the most available.  I have a friend who swears oatmilk is like drinking a milkshake.  Personally I like almond."
Doomsday all the way man. But that song goes so hard.
Inside Man was a good one.
"Totally true, anyway life is too short to just get into a field because you want the money. On the other hand if you don't care one way or the other, you might as well get into some high-paying career.

Money can also sometimes be a proxy for importance. Anesthesiologists getting a high pay probably means they are needing more of them.

Thinking positively a bit more, it could be that by the time you are going through medical school, you'll be totally carried by your motivation for the task at hand. It'll be the details of study that finally settle if you were truly meant for it."
"LOL

Wtf? That shades of lamp site is expensive...."
Recommend. I love this game so much
"Throw in the sequel, Killashandra.  Good choice.."
7 seconds kind of fits the bill. I'm about to watch it again.
So?  What does that achieve?
"I've had a different experience. At Home Depot the staff is chipper and *seemingly* helpful, but I haver never gotten an answer. What does happen over and over with them is that they'll say they need to go ask someone who knows and then never come back. 
    
At Lowe's, they aren't fake friendly, don't leave to flag down another sucker, and actually know some things about the section. 
   
It just feels like Home Depot spends all their training effort on the assumption that their people won't be there long enough to be useful, so may as well train them to be nice."
