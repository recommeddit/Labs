Some, but certainly not most.  The uninsured rate is about 10.9% of the population.   Accidents e.g. auto accidents aren't really a health care system issue but mainly auto insurance.",best country to live in

26669,"Lots of lightweight / party games. I tend to like some more brain burny games. Here are my faves:

1. Eclipse (basically risk on space with customizable ships)
2. Through the Ages - a civilization game. Pretty complex, but great fun. There's a fantastic app.
3. Race for the Galaxy - super quick card game. Basically, who can get an engine going quickest
4. Spirit Island - a coop about defending an island from European conquerers
5. Scythe - diesel punk area control
6. Agricola - build a farm while not starving
7. Bruges - card based euro. I think it's severely underrated 
8. Terraforming Mars - pretty much what it sounds like. But you're a Corp doing it for profit!
9. Tzolkin the Mayan calendar - a worker placement with a super cool giant gear!
10. Near & Far an adventure based game with a heavy narrative.",best board games

FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SS, depending on whether you want the OG battle frontier Emerald but ORAS are great, Platinum, B2/W2, Y and lastly Ultra Sun/Moon.

Avoid Ruby and sapphire, diamond and pearl, black and white 1 and the first sun and moon, please. I've played 1 from each and trust me, they're not worth it.",best Pokemon game

We used to live on the NW side, and after the Menards store on High School Rd closed, I'd normally go to the Lowe's on West 10th or the Lowe's on N. Michigan Rd, both of which are pretty good. So is the one on N. Shadeland, and it's not much more than ten minutes away from the Post Rd store (via 70-465-69-82ndSt exit-Shadeland).",best home improvement store

* What pissed off Britain?
* What pissed off the US?


War of 1812:

* What pissed off Britain? United States invasion
* What pissed off the US? British imposing against trade policy


Mexican War:

* What pissed off Mexico? Texas' slavery and secession, U.S. intervention
* What pissed off the US? US migrants to Mexico threatened in Texas


Civil War:

* What pissed off the North? The South's secession, slavery
* What pissed off the South? Abraham Lincoln's opinions on slavery


Spanish War:

* What pissed off Spain?
* What pissed off the US? A boat blew up under mysterious circumstances?


WWI:

* What pissed off the Central Powers? US Trade Policy
* What pissed off the US? Central Powers telling Mexico to declare war on US


WWII:

* What pissed off the Axis? US Trade Policy
* What pissed off the US? Japan bombing Pearl Harbor


Korea: ?

Vietnam: ?

Gulf: United Nations?

Afghanistan:

* What pissed off Afghanistan? Any form of religious enlightenment
* What pissed off the US? Afghanistan safe-keeping the people who bombed the WTC


Iraq:

* What pissed off Iraq? US invasion
* What pissed off the US? Popularly superficial reasons, but otherwise oil prices


I don't know enough of the circumstances of the Revolutionary War, but ""No Taxation without Representation"" certainly doesn't capture it in full. International trade is a major factor in most of the wars the US has been involved in.

You can't avoid the Mexican War and the Civil War, nor can you avoid WW-I&II. You also can't avoid the war in Afghanistan since the state was protecting Osama and allowing his organization a place to prepare for war/terrorism. I could imagine a war with Pakistan in the future if their government stays incompetent.

We could have avoided both Iraq wars.",best Mexican war to study
29706,"It's not so different from Dreamcast. It had a fair number of Dreamcast ports and sequels. I guess so did GameCube and PS2, but the Xbox ones stand out more to me. 

I really loved Xbox. In a way Microsoft was a lot like Sega back then, willing to try different things to stand out from the mainstream. They were the underdog challenging the establishment, and that led to a lot of games coming to it that didn't arrive elsewhere. Xbox was also the most powerful of its era, with also contributed to a lot of exclusive.

Xbox also has my favorite controller ever (the DUKE). That shit was perfect. 

It was really difficult for me to pick only five. There are a lot of others that are pretty close in there for me. The order was hard to pick too. Maybe if asked a different day I'd give different answers. But at the moment I answered this, these five are what came to mind. 

32X, PS2, GameCube, 360, Game Boy Micro, Vectrex, ColecoVision, Odyssey, LaserActive, Channel F, Astrocade, Microvision, and 3DO are all pretty high up there for me as well.",best game console
