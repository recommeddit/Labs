Butter pecan is far superior to chocolate. Prepare for destruction.
"I thought about getting a chest freezer, i can't imagine using one after i saw my sister digging around in hers for what she was looking for. 

We are saving up for a stand up freezer. For some reason the same technology standing up with a few cheap wire shelves costs a lot more."
Pc because of strategy games and management games.
"These are a bit long:

Person of Interest (2011)

The Blacklist (2013)


Similiar type of genre ones, timeless is only 2 seasons:

Timeless (2016)

Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013)"
Yeah there's a couple of stores here that will let you run on the concrete to test them out.
"Unless I'm really contagious or it's some kind of stomach virus or something where any kind of movement produces projectile vomit, I find that the best way to feel better is to get out of bed and do something/go somewhere. Lying in my own sickness just makes me feel worse, but fresh air and light movement make me feel much better.  I usually take a couple ibuprofen and some hand sanitizer and go window shopping or to the park or something."
Lies. Don't come. Worst time of life.
"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster

Final Fantasy XV

...Yeah, I'm not really into western RPGs. So sue me."
"Cal Poly SLO is very good for certain programs and for other programs is, as another commenter said, comparable with other UCs. You should do your own research but Cal Poly SLO is particularly known for Engineering, the sciences, and agriculture."
Same with Cody's Lab! He's one of my all time favorites!
"I’ve got an Anker if that capacity and it’s hella heavy. It’s never going to be light as it’s filled with batteries which are heavy. 

I’d recommend the Anker. I have 3 different models, all fantastic."
Hi! No it isn't an important factor for me.
Who on the team is Rocky?
Yakuza 7 and if you don't care about graphics to much DQ s is coming out December 4 and if you want a fun pokemon rip off their is also Nexomon

Lower that shit because AJ is the better receiver.
"Since you mentioned Black Mirror, I gotta throw out for Inside No. 9. I got it from a subreddit recommendation list myself. It's INCREDIBLE. Definitely more of a comedic twist than Black Mirror, but a great show that I binged really hard."
Bunnies require a lot more work then people assume and aren't always cool with being handled so it might not be a good choice. My girlfriend's six year old wanted nothing more then to pet and play with my bunny when he was alive and he hated everybody and never participated willingly
"They usually win people's hearts and not the matches.

(wait this is not sledge thread?)"
"That’s what we do, at $DAY_JOB, although our decision predates fetch happening.

Do need to write some wrapping code to turn streams into promises to make it easier to use with the rest of your codebase, but it’s not _hard_ work"
But why else would you go?!
"3GS was my first iPhone so it was the biggest change in moving from a history of crap smartphones (Windows Phones back when they were running CE and Palms) but then the 4 with its new form factor, Retina display, great camera and performance was a game changer"
"The Anker 10000 PD is lovely. Actually... I have the older 10000, too. Both are smaller than a deck of cards and will fast charge most phones I have tried."
"I've only listened to it a couple times, admittedly, but I definitely got more of a R&B vibe from it."
