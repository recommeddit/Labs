Oh yeah. In the US they both start at $39k USD.
Coherence is good shit
Shrimp and grits with two sunny-side-up eggs on top. Soooo good.
"I love my roomba robot vacuum. Seriously, you can set the timer and it will do it automatically everyday. Perfect when the kids start crawling."
"Why is it that when you walk into a house where a great meal has been cooking, that wonderful smell of food... smells so *awful* on a human, outside of the context of food -- e.g. sitting next to someone who smells like bacon in a theater?"
That was just great. 11/10
I love Science Friday.  They do really good in depth interviews with scientists about their field/findings.

"Oh! Damn! Now your talking! 
Thatâ€™s my kind of ice cream! Will look for it! 

Matcha must be good! 

Cake batter? How?"
"Donâ€™t forget the G7 has a 240hz refresh rate., but I believe the 24in starts at ~$700."
I really wish they'd add a donate button on artists pages. I've found so much good music and I feel guilty that these people are only getting fractions of a penny per play.
"The wind blows the wispy branches all around and they are considered tranquil and  peaceful trees. Kind of like how lava lamps are mostly just cool to look at as the ""lava"" floats around. Both considered a stressball for the eyes if you will."
"The T20 explanation would explain why the standard of batting is up while bowling is down but I'm not really sure - Australia has a fair history over the last few decades of wagging tails (I'm thinking back tot he likes of Paul Reifel) but this one was the best. 

It was even better in that Gilchrist was coming in and making tonnes when we were already 5-500. Johnson and the others have been fighting rearguards for the current team."

"**Keyflower** - A bidding worker placement game that works at all player counts. Balance using your workers as currency to expand your town, using actions on any visible tile, and possibly giving your opponent more workers next round.

**Eclipse** - Heavy euro 4x space game. Might not be best for someone just getting into the hobby, but it is a game you should have.

**Roll for the Galaxy** - Dice game where you roll some dice and build a space empire. Plays fast, and is fairly easy to learn.

**Seasons** - Card drafting and dice rolling combined into a really great game. Collect energy to play the cards you drafted to build an engine to get the most points.

**Viticulture** - Card driven worker placement game about making wine. It has a really cool, simple mechanic for getting grapes and turning them into wine.

**Suburbia** *or* **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** - I'd say either game is great depending on your theme preference. I actually prefer the city building theme in Suburbia, but Castles did make some things play a little better. Score points for building the best city/castle.

**Taluva** - This might be my favorite abstract game. Build a 3D island out of volcanoes and be the first one to build up your island city. 

**Star Realms** - Fantastic deckbuilding game that plays in no time. Also a good intro to deckbuilding if you haven't played any.

**Lanterns** - Great, simple tile laying game. I never was a huge fan of Carcassone, visually or mechanically, so this was an easy replacement.

**Agricola** - The game is a mile deep with all of the different possible card options. It needs to be there simply because of replayability."
"Finns can name wars. Two of the wars in their history is 

The Greater Wrath

The Lesser Wrath

Anyone who names their wars ""Wrath"" sould not be fucked with."
"hell yes. thank god there is someone out there who also like it besides me.
I'm using it for like 7 years and I'm not thinking about changing it in near future.."
"Death Grips is great for heavy workouts, the rawness & cathodic tones put me in the zone. It's definitely not for everyone but give it a try https://youtu.be/tIlY_lms_tE
Also loveeee trace/house music, been jamming out to this song, you've heard it before but this version of Five More Hours will get you going!

Let me know if you want more."
"I mean, when you wash dishes I still find food in the cupboard."
"A great list of not only mind bending films, but great ones. This is the definitive list OP"
"1.  SFGAm - Best coaster collection by far of any SF park to me.  Easily my favorite.

2.  SFoG - Fav coaster(Goliath), a good overall collection but nothing else spectacular, lots of trees, 

3.  SFGAd - good collection of coasters, my favorite layout and location of the SF chain

4.  SFMM - Been 16 years since I've been here so can't remember too much and I'm sure the park has changed a lot in many ways.

5.  SFDK - Besides Joker (which is amazing), not much else exciting.    

RIP - SFWoA  -  A fun park and such a shame its gone."
