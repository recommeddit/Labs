Reading this thread just made me wish we had  the option to smell things through the internet
Is that the order you're ranking them in?
Cryo-Cuff [makes something](http://www.sourceortho.net/cryo-cuff-ic-motorized-cooler-w-shoulder-cuff/) that freezes your chest really well.
Your mom sounds like my mom. A new hobby once a week. A particularly memorable one was juggling. Pretty sure those balls have been sitting in the closet for years now.
DHgate is probably the easiest. These products come from China so shipping will take forever. Alternatively you can use a shopping agent or order directly from the seller to get it sooner but shipping will be a bit costly.
"a general rule of thumb for me (and there will always be exceptions) is that I use HD for materials, and Lowe's for more finished products."
"Yes. I will be killed if I speak more on it. Nah, I just cant remember any specific titles or names."
Yup. It lasts at least the entire week.
Light Blue. It's a panty dropper.
"I like SiteGround. Their customer service team are very friendly, helpful and - best of all - efficient.
Their basic plan is pretty good to, and can handle around 10,000 visits per month. That’s the kinda traffic I get at the moment. And if my website grows quickly, I can just get an easy upgrade. 
You also get unlimited subdomains and emails, which I think is pretty cool. 
And in the event something goes wrong with your website, I found that they ask for as much information as possible so that they can help you sort it as quickly as they can. If, however, they can’t fix it from the server side, they will instead send you over to someone who can help you. This really pleased me and I’d say that SiteGround is easily one of the best when it comes to customer service. It’s as though they’ve actually invested proper time, care and money into securing the best agents. 
Overall, my experience with SiteGround has been very good and I have no qualms with recommending them to others. That said, for a cheaper option, GreenGeeks is also okay. It’s not as good as SiteGround IMHO, and they don’t seem to be completely open when it comes with how much visits are allowed (they’re also a closed book when it comes to disk space - is it unlimited, is it not?)."
Hey it makes no sense to me either and that’s what I said about these lists they pick and choose what data and variables to make it work. Some are from strong 2020 seasons and some they use “projections” for 2021
"I like Home Depot for LED lights, I like Lowes for lumber.  Otherwise, either one is fine with me."
"I'm currently using vifm. I used ranger before, but for some reason I changed."
"It's worth keeping in mind with Croatia and Serbia that they often draw their players from their diaspora population as well as their local population. Some examples which spring to mind are Ivan Rakitic and Milos Veljkovic who were born and raised entirely in Switzerland, but due to their parentage, and presumably a strong sense of identity with their parents' homeland, opted to play for Croatia and Serbia respectively. It can be a bit misleading to look simply at the population of the country to determine their potential pool of players, for that reason. Still very impressive for them, either way."
Thank God there’s no toothbrush state....
What kind of basic tasks do you do with it?
Absolutely- hence my giving PLOS as an example of the alternative.

in IT is it what you know. I started helpdesk but now I am in a director role. only took 9 years but it was all on my own.
"Ah, the old family recipe."
"a regular bic pen can be one of the best.

I also like these inexpensive japanese pens called Multiball. They are roller balls, but have a slight texture to the ball so you can feel it on the paper. 

Hit up jetpens.com for all your pen porn needs.

#2 and bic can be the best though."
"Sensodine helped me with these. They hurt like a bitch, sorry you have 3."
"I got one in June for work purposes, don’t play many games but call and text a lot holds up for the day, miss my android battery however"
I like that schools and colleges now have dispensers for filtered water so you can refill your thermos containers. Plastic water bottles should be outlawed.
Switch. Nintendo does a really good job of appealing to all age groups. Most of their games are kid friendly but still very fun for adults
