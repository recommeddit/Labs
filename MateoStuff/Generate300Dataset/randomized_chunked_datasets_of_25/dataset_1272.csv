54899,"I have a whole-house filter because I use well water.  The filter is a snap to change.  You unscrew a cup-shaped thing that the filter sits in.  Dump out the old filter, put in the new one.

HOWEVER, be sure that when the filter is installed, its plumbinb is fitted with a bypass valve.  Otherwise, it would be a pain because you would have to shut off the water for your whole house and drain the pipes to change it.  A plumber will charge you about $250 in my area to put one in, plus the cost of the filter.  You most likely have to sweat copper to do it.  We added ours during construction when the tools were available.",best water filter

40991,"> playing the piano at a high level is *not* easy

To expand on this, the big reason is because piano is so easy that being able to play it at a high level just has you doing *so much*. I mean, aside from other finger keyboards like it, what other instruments are able to do what pianos can do at the efficiency and ease you can with a piano? Just off the top of my head:

1. Moving around super thick jazz chords with all manner of extensions

2. Playing a smooth 4-part harmony with relatively independent lines

3. Playing a melody, chords, and a (relatively) complex baseline all at once",best instrument to play

61720,"We definitely do. The games you listed are lacking the core elements of what makes an RPG. Player's choice story developments, crafting, grinding, weapon and ability upgrades, etc. 

While some of the games you listed may include some of these elements, they are more of an action-adventure game than an RPG. No one would ever say Spiderman or Shadow of the Colossus is an RPG. Games like Mass Effect, Fallout, and Final Fantasy are more traditional RPGs",Best RPG game on PS4
