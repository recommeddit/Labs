68883,best science fiction novel,"I hadn't realized they nominated China Meiville, that's sort of funny considering he is actually a proper leftist as far as I know not liberal left etc.
This place does always recommend the same things I agree but to temper that complaint look at the way Jesmin has dominated the recent Hugo awards, I see more interesting answers when the question is more specific.
I am probably not the right person for this argument anyway as I have found it harder to find new authors I like since maybe 2010, noticed the decline in the Gardiner Dozios yearly anthology I religiously bought"

Is it a good game or just a pretentious gimmick?"

50902,best rap album,"Does anyone put TPAB in this category?? (I don't, I'm just curious because of all the positive reviews it has gotten, rightfully so)"
54899,best water filter,"I have a whole-house filter because I use well water.  The filter is a snap to change.  You unscrew a cup-shaped thing that the filter sits in.  Dump out the old filter, put in the new one.

HOWEVER, be sure that when the filter is installed, its plumbinb is fitted with a bypass valve.  Otherwise, it would be a pain because you would have to shut off the water for your whole house and drain the pipes to change it.  A plumber will charge you about $250 in my area to put one in, plus the cost of the filter.  You most likely have to sweat copper to do it.  We added ours during construction when the tools were available."

32417,best vacation resort,"We have had wonderful experiences in Cozumel, Aruba, and Puerto Rico. Would recommend any of them. For sheer relaxation on the beach and some water activities, I would jump at the chance to go to Aruba. Absolutely beautiful water, soft beaches, a constant light breeze, and a very relaxed atmosphere. Have fun wherever you go!"
40991,best instrument to play,"> playing the piano at a high level is *not* easy

To expand on this, the big reason is because piano is so easy that being able to play it at a high level just has you doing *so much*. I mean, aside from other finger keyboards like it, what other instruments are able to do what pianos can do at the efficiency and ease you can with a piano? Just off the top of my head:

1. Moving around super thick jazz chords with all manner of extensions

2. Playing a smooth 4-part harmony with relatively independent lines

3. Playing a melody, chords, and a (relatively) complex baseline all at once"

61720,Best RPG game on PS4,"We definitely do. The games you listed are lacking the core elements of what makes an RPG. Player's choice story developments, crafting, grinding, weapon and ability upgrades, etc. 

While some of the games you listed may include some of these elements, they are more of an action-adventure game than an RPG. No one would ever say Spiderman or Shadow of the Colossus is an RPG. Games like Mass Effect, Fallout, and Final Fantasy are more traditional RPGs"
21723,best winnie the pooh comic,The other one rolled down I think.
