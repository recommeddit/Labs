46867,best hand santizer brand,"No...soap is pretty neat in that it has both polar and nonpolar domains, so it is attracted to water (polar) and dirts & oils (nonpolar.) When you wash with soap, it actually binds to the dirt and oil and the water binds to it and washes it away. Mechanical action (rubbing your hands together) helps, but soap [definitely serves a purpose](http://www.worldofmolecules.com/3D/soap.htm)."

30618,best Mexican war to study,"I take great umbrage at your opinion that the Korean war was unjustified.

The Communists attack SK without provocation, and Communist control of SK endangered US interests in Japan.

Even without the necessity of protecting US interests, the goal of protecting a population from a communist government is a noble motivation.

Additionally, the US was not the aggressor."

57194,best water brand,Depends on where your tap water comes from. Ours is literally getting bottled and sold by a water company in some sort of deal with our town and it's the exact same stuff that comes from our tap. A friend who lives in a large city brings empty gallon jugs when she visits us because her tap water tastes bad. I've had it and it does not taste good to me either.

They live in a small town in Bavaria (for those of you who don't know, these are the lederhosen wearing folk) and every single morning it is these delicious fresh buns from a bakery (34 cents each) with jam, and sausage. They did not deviate from this breakfast the entire time we were there. Sausage is also known as lunch and dinner there, fyi."
