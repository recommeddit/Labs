"Or kill the main protagonist if the third movie as the twist for the fourth.  I was so excited to see him escape and search for his daughter as a subplot in four.  But no, the writers had to make us think about that trapped kid throughout the fourth one only to show is, hey, you didn't even need to start worrying yet."
"do you know, is it legal for others to distribute the paper for free once they have it?

Any reason authors don't put their papers up on their own media? (or maybe they do)"
"You should really specify the original Wicker Man, OP did not ask for unintentionally hilarious films, although that would be a fun thread."

"This used to be my fragrance as well, until my mother in law asked me one day what I was wearing and then went and bought the perfume and moisturiser version for herself, so she was drenched in it every time she took a shower. I can't wear it now coz my husband would only smell his mother if I do."
"As someone who works in run specialty, I really miss the numbers. If you know the system you can guess pretty well what a shoe is going to be like just from the name."
You’re probably right about not finding much use after graduation. That’s kinda the way of calculators. I just view the the price tag like a reusable textbook because I’m supposed to need it for 3 classes
"You're right, they are making a racist system possible, but (for some) their belief that people have the liberty to choose who they do business with for whatever reason they want outweighs their views on the rights of people to not be discriminated against. You probably could argue they're being racist by omission, but I don't think they're openly racist. Rand Paul doesn't strike me as racist. He strikes me as anti-authority, and that includes the unfortunate side of that coin.

I obviously don't agree with the position but I can understand where it comes from without it being racism (or bigotry in general)."
Can confirm. From the part of NY thats not the city.
"My parents never let me eat the things that weren't factory packaged, for fear of razor blades, etc."
"In summer, you're *probably* not going to die. You might be cold, lost and miserable from your night in the woods, but *most* people don't die.

In winter? Get lost or into trouble and you're going to be a popsicle by morning if you're unprepared.

We're also over the yearly records for numbers of rescues with people flocking to the outdoors. While rescue should never be relied on, resources may be thinner than usual as well."

"And in case of UK...

"Snickers is always the best of everything.  Worst is anything licorice. 

Not a fan of Three Musketeers either, but not the worst to me.  I think your other selections are mighty fine!"
"LeafGreen and/or FireRed

It's a remake of the original Pokemon but in more palatable GameBoy Advance (SNES-style) graphics (using the Ruby/Sapphire engine).

That one is good to be introduced, or reintroduced, into the series. Gameplay-wise my favorite is Black/White. I like it more so than the later ones (Sun/Moon, etc)."
all hail prime minster Stephen W Harbush!
"Thanks, this info is desperately needed. There are about three questions a day looking for hotspot plans. Most are looking for unlimited data and can't believe that, with rare exceptions and caveats, nobody is selling unlimited high speed for hundreds of GB a month."
"Also consider taking a look at the -> ASUS VivoBook Pro. It packs the latest 8th gen i7 Processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB M.2 SSD + 1TB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (4GB) and weighs 4.6 lbs. Best if you can try it at your local stores and see if it works for you. Good luck!"

"I'm not saying you should do it irresponsibly but I find placing an emphasis on ""responsible"" a bit clichéd. Plus irresponsible drug use seems to be a lot more fun I imagine. I don't think any rock star ever said ""watch me do this minimum effective dose line of coke"" at a great party."
