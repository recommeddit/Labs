If I were a woman I'd definitely have some bottles of Fantasy in my collection.
Is it a good book for beginners?
"It's owned by a Chinese shell company, they pay heavily for shill reviews (just Google ""best vpn""), and they post shill comments on social media (like Reddit) and review sites.

Other than that, they seem great."

"My dad knows the guy who made these. He brought a few filters last year and I have to admit, it's 10x better than Brita or any other filtered water I've had. 

It comes with a thermometer looking stick that measures the solid density in liquids. Always a 0.00 with a new Zero filter. It almost taste sweet it's so good."
"Georgina Heyer is pretty good although she comes with all of the racism/antisemitism etc of the 1930s. She did regency novels. *Marriage of Convenience* was a favorite.

Mary Stewart I really loved. Her books feature smart heroines who have no problem taking care of themselves and who also aren't flat characterization. I love anything she's ever written.


The all time worst book that I remember reading is tied between JP Monninger's new book *The Map That Leads To You* and *The Star Witch* by Linda Winstead Jones. In the first one the author writes like a college student and worse than Stephenie Meyer or EL James. The leading man is  cookie-cutter bland and the leading lady is also bland and is the sort of person who talks about her inner goddess with her friends who are also stereotypes and there for the diversity count.  WITCH has a ripped guy who looks at a woman and imagines her naked when they first meet. The woman slutshames a lot and is also a ""strong woman"" because she can fight with swords or something. I wound up cutting it up for an art project. 

I've found the shittiest romances usually involve a lot of stereotypes about women and men; the frigid ice queen woman, the guy who isn't interested in women after his last girlfriend burned him, the set-up that excites passion (they get wet, she sees him doing something manly like kill spiders for her, he gets shirtless...) are all tropes that appear."
"Have you considered the Volt? For your commute it will be an EV, and for trips it will be just like your ice car. Great first ev imo."
