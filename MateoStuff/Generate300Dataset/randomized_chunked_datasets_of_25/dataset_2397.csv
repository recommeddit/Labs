44848,"Same goes for the wax that they use in car washes (the automatic ones anyway). It never works as it should and it always leaves streaks because the windshield is never prepared in advance.

What I mean here by preparing your windshield is that at the very minimum it should be 100% clean, dry and fat-free (preferably smooth as well, i.e. polished). Then apply Rain-X or wax, make sure it has time to cure, then buff it out completely. Add a little bit to your windshield wipers for good measure (these should always be clean anyway, to prevent scratching). This way you never get streaking, you always have crystal clear vision and the Rain-X stuff works like magic. For like a few months, anyway.

Considering the windshield is the part of the car you look at / through 95% of the time, I would think it well worth the effort.",best items under $100

After a terrible beating left Mark Hogancamp brain damaged, he began creating models of a fictional town, Marwencol, to process the trauma. Jeff Malmberg's documentary explains how Hogancamp uses the elaborate dioramas as stand-ins for real life.

* **Indie Game: The Movie:**
This captivating documentary follows several indie game designers as they painstakingly develop their games and hope for breakthrough success.

* **The Queen of Versailles:**
Meet the Siegels, glitterati who made a fortune in the time-share business only to see it crumble in the 2008 financial collapse. The site of their rise and almost-fall is their home (America's largest), a gaudy replica of the Palace of Versailles.

* **Into the Abyss:**
Director Werner Herzog's compelling documentary examines the emotional aftermath of a triple murder in Texas, interviewing the two convicted killers, their relatives, the victims' families and law-enforcement officials involved in the case.

* **The Thin Blue Line:**
Filmmaker Errol Morris's gripping investigation into the murder of a Dallas police officer was responsible for freeing the man who was originally -- and erroneously -- charged with and convicted of the crime.

* **Pressure Cooker:**
Three Philadelphia high school students negotiate the challenges of the inner city and the demands of their tough-minded culinary arts teacher, Wilma Stephenson, to become contenders in a citywide cooking competition. Charming and surprisingly hilarious, Jennifer Grausman and Mark Becker's inspiring, Emmy-nominated documentary showcases the heights young minds can reach, regardless of their environment, when they're expected to succeed.

* **Page One: Inside the New York Times:**
Documentarian Andrew Rossi goes inside the New York Times to examine how the venerable paper is preparing for the future of newsprint.

* **Hot Coffee:** This documentary examines the so-called ""hot coffee lawsuit"" in which a woman sued McDonald's after she spilled her coffee and burned herself, specifically looking at the reasons why the fast-food giant invested heaps of money to sway public opinion.

Plus, U.S. Netflix seems to have all of ESPN's 30 for 30 documentaries, most of which are well worth watching if you like sports documentaries. 

Documentaries seems to be one of the genres that Netflix has the best selection of. We have an annual documentary film festival here in Toronto, and a lot of the most buzzed about movies of recent years (Marwencol, The Imposter, The Invisible War, Queen of Versailles etc.) are available for streaming, at least in the U.S. Even in Canada, the selection is not so bad. I guess the rights to documentaries are easier for Netflix to license than big budget action movies or whatever.",best Netflix documentary
