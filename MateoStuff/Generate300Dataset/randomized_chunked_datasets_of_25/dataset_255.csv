12280,best gifts for dad,"No. Step and sleep tracking only (and notifications for your phone if you want those too).

With only step and sleep tracking you can wear it over a month between charges and it's totally waterproof etc though so it's largely wear it and forget it which is it's biggest selling point along with the very low price (20-30 bucks)."

55597,best action and adventure novel series,"Read anything by Brandon Sanderson.. it's all top notch stuff. I started with the [**Mistborn trilogy**] (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.Mistborn) and kept going.. he's a fantastic writer and creates some truly great high fantasy. Excellently thought out magic systems, vivid worlds and characters, and twists that keep you on your toes. Another benefit to reading Sanderson is that he turns out material quicker than most, and his books aren't short on word count. Another sort of neat thing to consider is that almost all of his novels are subtly connected and he seems to be weaving a greater story behind the scenes.. 

He has also begun, what should prove to be, his longest and greater work yet.. The Stormlight Archive .. a series of 10 planned books. The first, The Way of Kings, is phenomenal (and clocks in at 1000 pages).. the 2nd is due out January 2014 ..  the waiting for this series is going to drive me mad."

The lean start up - framework for turning ideas into useful products

From zero to one - more start ups

Never split the difference - negotiating frameworks

Sapiens - why humans do what they do

Thinking Fast and Slow - decision making frameworks 

Brene brown - people managing frameworks

measure what matters - goal setting frameworks

70873,best movies with a cool twist,"Check out 'The Departed' came out in the mid 2000s I'd say 2006 or so. It's got Leonardo DiCaprio (One of his best performances in my opinion), Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg for the lead cast. It seems to fit the bill with what you're looking for it definitely has it's fair share of plot twists."
44281,best items under $100,"So I go to eBay to check up on how much Smartwool socks are because my favourite undies are Bonds Hipster Trunks, which are $25 in store but about $8 each in bulk lots on eBay (maybe knockoffs, but they've cupped my scrote as well as the genuine article for the last year without looking like losing their stretchy sexiness).

Anyway, people are selling used socks on eBay. Used socks! Who the hell buys used socks? Goddamn people who want scrofulous fungal infections, that's who."
68060,best science fiction novel,Definitely.  Was way ahead of it's time when it came out.
