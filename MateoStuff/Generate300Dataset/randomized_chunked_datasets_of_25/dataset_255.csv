With only step and sleep tracking you can wear it over a month between charges and it's totally waterproof etc though so it's largely wear it and forget it which is it's biggest selling point along with the very low price (20-30 bucks).",best gifts for dad

55597,"Read anything by Brandon Sanderson.. it's all top notch stuff. I started with the [**Mistborn trilogy**] (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.Mistborn) and kept going.. he's a fantastic writer and creates some truly great high fantasy. Excellently thought out magic systems, vivid worlds and characters, and twists that keep you on your toes. Another benefit to reading Sanderson is that he turns out material quicker than most, and his books aren't short on word count. Another sort of neat thing to consider is that almost all of his novels are subtly connected and he seems to be weaving a greater story behind the scenes.. 

He has also begun, what should prove to be, his longest and greater work yet.. The Stormlight Archive .. a series of 10 planned books. The first, The Way of Kings, is phenomenal (and clocks in at 1000 pages).. the 2nd is due out January 2014 ..  the waiting for this series is going to drive me mad.",best action and adventure novel series
