"Hey, glad you have enjoyed those! I went to high school with him, and worked on some of his first independent films. For his later stuff, I did still photography, worked as a grip, and as an extra. Mainly just helping support a very long time friend who happens to make some cool movies"
"Or gook.

Edit: The joke was that it's one letter off from goon, and means the same thing as the above comment, though more offensively. Clearly this joke did not go over as well as I had anticipated. I apologize."
I put so many hours into that Underground! So much fun! I would support a remake of Diamond and Pearl! : )
"I'm not sure if you're serious or not, but no, I don't think so. Just like I don't think UCLA is now ""better"" than Berkeley. 

Some UCs do have better graduate programs (in specific areas of study) than other UCs. Some programs are better funded at some UCs than others. Those rankings matter. But the general undergraduate rankings are pretty useless."
"Agreed, similar experience"
It me
"Scrubs for sure. Fast paced, funny, witty dialogue."
Various shades of grey.
I'm telling you because you asked.
The performance difference is more than $50 worth.
I love what my friend did. She would take me out once a month. As a new mom it was heavenly.
Yeeeep
"The best Father's Day gift I ever received was the year my wife set up a golf foursome with my three sons and I. She faked me out and told me to make sure I had my fishing license with me then delivered me to the golf course where my three boys were waiting. We had a wonderful day. And while a hammock would make a nice gift, your father will appreciate some of your time more than anything. Crap - now I'm crying just thinking about it."
"The Porches Inn in North Adams, MA. It's like if a really nice bed and breakfast decided to spread out and get comfortable.

Next to that, the Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston."
"Malcolm Marshall, fast medium, deadly accurate. Like a black Jimmy Anderson
Andy Roberts, fast and hostile
Joel Garner, tall, fast, hostile with a fantastic yorker
Michael Holding, fast, hostile, able to swing the ball away.

Result: Carnage"
"I have a friend have ipad with matte screen protector and is loving it. But the image quality looked terrible for watching videos etc. it was a dealbreaker for me as it has such an amazing speaker quality but by applying the matte it turned out not what someone would expect. 

So I got myself a normal screen protector and I’m pretty much in love with that. Sure it took 1-2 days to adjust but it was worth it plus it didn’t made much impact on my handwriting considering I usually write around 10-11 hrs a day."
And alligators.

"A shot of Jack, and as soon as it goes down, another shot of Jack. Followed by sleep. If still sick, repeat."
"If we're talking strictly budget, even a used gtx 1070 or rx 580 will be fine for all but the most demanding games. For the best bang per buck at $400 usd new tax included, **with stock right now**, probably a 2060 super. If you can wait a few months, the 3060 is expected to come out."
"Corned beef hash lover here.

I order corned beef hash basically whenever I see it on a menu, and I've had a lot of gourmet, made in house corned beef hashes. While many of them are fantastic, my favorites are always found in greasy spoon diners that use canned corned beef."
I don't have you tagged because AlienBlue lacks that feature :<
"His name is Robert Paulson. Oh, I mean usual suspects"
"Denist here. I don't are what toothpaste someone uses as long as it has fluoride in it. But watch out for the abrasive toothpastes, you will lose layers of enamel over time and that is what make your teeth strong and white!"
"Well how’s your experience with it? Like someone else said in this thread, they prefer writing on glass, so I wouldn’t be surprised if someone actually prefers writing on the kwmobile one. I just personally didn’t.

Edit: I somehow missed the part where you said that it arrives in a few weeks. Sorry."
