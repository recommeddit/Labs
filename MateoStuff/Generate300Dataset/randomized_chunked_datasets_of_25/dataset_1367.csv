16079,"> I have a pair of Wayfarers from the 60s when they were made by Bausch and Lomb, and those things are tanks. The pair I lost weren't even comparable.

You have no idea how bad it's gotten. I broke a pair of 2013 WFs at a party in 2017, bought another pair, and had the screws fall out within weeks due to no mistreatment. They replaced those, then those got stolen. Insurance covered that, tried a Clubmaster series. Liked how they looked but felt cheap. Broke in two weeks. Asked for a refund and was told no. Would've gone elsewhere but couldn't *see*, so I asked the clerk for a recommendation and he gave me some POLOS that have held up nicely (despite also being Luxottica).

Moral of the story, do not buy Luxottica brands anymore, ever. They're basically roadside vendor quality now at high-fashion markups. I have more faith in quality control from *drug dealers*, FFS.",best sunglasses for fashion
