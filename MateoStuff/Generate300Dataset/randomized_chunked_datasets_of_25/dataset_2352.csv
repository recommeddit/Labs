27511,best bollywood actor,"Emraan is rather underrated as a actor. People till now judge him for his earlier films which had loads of sex and kissing but his performances in 
OUATIM, dirty picture, Ek thi Daayan, Gangster, Awarapan, jannat etc were quite good...."

64552,Best Nike running shoes,"Good to know, after making this thread figured I should head to the mall on the weekend since there's a Nike store to at least try a few of them on. But yea was eyeing the React Infinity and the Zoom X Invincible if they come out soon."
34691,best NFL player,Why is Champ Bailey so low? He should be way higher than 87. At least top 50
57179,best water brand,"> A $2 bottle of water costs the manufacturer about $0.05 to make.

If you just buy 'normal' bottled water by the case at the grocery store, you're only paying like $0.12/bottle, often less. The small price is worth the convenience for a lot of people and certainly healthier than drinking a bottle of soda. 

>Not to mention the plastic waste it makes.

I'm not a fan of that, but I also recycle so I'm personally not too bothered."

22166,best celebrity,Pushing Daisies is one show I'm surprised Reddit doesn't show more love for.  Or maybe Reddit does and I miss it every time...
30467,best Mexican war to study,"I'll have to agree with this.  Vietnam, being an ""unpopular"" war, is absolutely fascinating.  The politics, the subterfuge, the near inabiltiy of the US to goad the North into set-piece battles, the control of information and the intentional disemination of misinformation... it's incredible stuff.  In addition to the aforementioned Chickenhawk, I highly recommend Appy's [Working Class War: American Soldiers in Vietnam](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Class-War-American-Soldiers-Vietnam/dp/0807843911/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1281107759&sr=8-1) and [Patriots: The Vietnam War Remembered from All Sides](http://www.amazon.com/Patriots-Vietnam-War-Remembered-Sides/dp/0142004499/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1281107832&sr=1-1)."

69712,best major to study in college,"In my first year in science (In my school science majors aren't chosen until your second year really so it was all students) the assistant dean asked the entire year to raise their hands if they were trying to get into med school. Literally 4/5 of everyone did it in a like 300 person room. He then told us that historically, one or two of us would actually get in."

22048,best celebrity,"Nick Offerman. He came into my cafe and I tried to play it really cool and not bother him lol. When he was getting up to leave I awkwardly said how much I enjoyed his book on woodworking and he looked so genuinely surprised. Introduced himself to me, shook my hand, asked my name. He gave me some woodworking tips and went on his way. I ended up seeing him again at an event and he remembered me and my name. He's a genuinely kind and humble person who is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what he does. 10/10 would like him to adopt me."

39089,best web browser,"Microsoft Edge (Chromium): It is much, much faster than Chrome and Firefox and uses less resources (both RAM and CPU) as it's optimized really well for Windows. Edge is even faster than Brave when you install uBlock Origin.  
  
In my opinion, Microsoft Edge (with Strict Tracking Protection and uBlock Origin) is the best alternative to Chrome. It's lightweight, private, and reasonably feature-packed (screenshot tool, vertical tabs, collections, downloads flyout, PDF reader, reader view, etc.). Edge Beta is currently my default browser."
