My aunt used to wear this and she was a mum who juggled two jobs, and I still think her the peak of femininity. 
I wear it too, and it just makes me feel successful and powerful- thanks Kenzo!",best perfume

56851,"Can anyone recommend a monitor that has the following specs? I play a lot of Red Dead 2 on an Nvidia RTX 2060 and want an upgrade from my MSI 24'' 1080p monitor. I don't really play games competitively but a low latency is still preferred.

1440p
30-34 inches
HDR ready
1-4ms 
Curved screen, preferably 1000r or 1500r. (I have 1800r right now in a 24 inch)

Around $450-500 CAD.

These are two I've been contemplating. Any opinions on whether this would be good for gaming?

70105,"Yes! The other thing is that I feel that design is one of those fields where working harder won't really equate to doing better.

A lot of students I've encountered just didn't have a good eye for design, and that translated to their work. No matter how many pointers you give them, they just wouldn't ""get it"". It's like trying to design while being severely colorblind (not trying to say all colorblind people can't design, just making a rough point). They can learn all the technical points, you can't really teach someone how to have creative talent.

On the other hand, the talented students will often barely need to iterate on a design at all--they'll hit it on the dot their first or second draft.

There are also those students who are design savants but don't ever show up to class, turn in work, or finish projects. Those are the most frustrating, because they clearly are extremely talented but will fail classes because they have poor work ethic.",best major to study in college

I want bore you with the stats but it consists of old computer parts that I either saved from the landfill or someone gave me something when they upgraded their gaming computer. I have a tendency to hoard old tech. I found a Blue Spark Digital mic for half the normal price because it had been returned to Amazon. Only thing wrong is that they threw the wrong mic stand back in the box which I don't use anyway, and the USB port is a little hinky sometimes. I originally for the mic for singing. I just bought a desk mounted spring loaded mic stand for 13 bucks which they actually sent me 2 for the price by the way. I will also be buying some chroma key fabric for 10 bucks soon.
