"I used to favor Home Depot because I drove past it every day, then moved and switched to Lowes because it's closer now. Of the two, my Home Depot no longer has knowledgeable people to ask questions (they all seem to be minimum-wage clerks who don't even pretend to know anything) while Lowe's still does.

If I need a lot of lumber, I avoid the big box stores and go to an actual lumber yard because of the huge quality difference."

"Aurora was my favorite of his. I also read 2312, and it was ok. I liked how egalitarian it was, but the central narrative wasn't very interesting. He is great at world building. I guess that's why I liked Aurora. The world was small, and so it became more character driven by force, and with the ship as a character, I thought was awesome. I like when the robots are good. Like TARS from Interstellar."

Only downside, no VESA mount.
