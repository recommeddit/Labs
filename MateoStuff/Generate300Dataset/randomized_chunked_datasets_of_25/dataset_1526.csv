23215,best social networking site for CS,"Thank you! I'm going to follow your instructions to the dot.

I have no experience with backend coding so I'll need to decipher a couple of phrases you used. 

I'm going to give my 100% to this project! Maybe I can provide you with updates every week or so and you can correct me if I'm headed down the wrong road?"
5067,best home improvement store,I can't find a damn thing at Lowe's.  Menards.
73327,best Linux distro,Thanks for the reply! I would really appreciate it if you could give me some tips and also recommended me some of the apps that you are using!
23194,best social networking site for CS,"Stay well away from Dreamweaver. I used it WAY back, some 20 years ago or so, and it was a hindrance to the learning process even then. I've taken another look at it form time to time, but to be honest it hasn't improved, just got prettier buttons.

If you're serious about code and want a good editor that doesn't get in your way, try Sublime Text. I don't thing you're ready for the likes of Vim.

But honestly, from your post I take it you know just enough of each language to identify it when it's being used but not much else. I can honestly say you wont be able to deliver this project without some professional help.

So rather than go out and hire someone, why don't you find a quality local developer that you can get to assess your project. Pay them for a few hours of their time and get an honest informed opinion on where you stand, and what's needed to get your project off the ground."
24091,best anime,"Without movies. Also, no particular order.

50799,best rap album,"I love everything Jim Jones touches these days. He can’t miss.

Love Dave East, too. Listening since maybe ‘13-14. Straight Outta Harlem and all that good stuff. I think he came out with a dud with this one though. Maybe I should re-listen. I’ve gone through it twice now."
33451,best electric car,To not read the article is one thing but you apparently didn’t even read the headline. These are supposed to be coming to production next year.

26979,best board games,"You really should realize that you are an outlier. I give people exactly as much credit as they deserve. I have taught games to a lot of people, and the majority of them have their eyes glaze over when you pull out a game that will have a 20+ minute rules explanation and a 3 hour first-timer playtime."
28350,best breakfast foods,"With time: Two butter poached eggs sunny side-up, three strips of crispy oven baked bacon, some toasted farm bread, either some fresh tomato (summer) or avacado (winter) and a cup of french press. 

Quick: hard boiled egg with half a grapefruit and some granola or some sliced tomatoes and cottage cheese"

51188,best rap album,I personally hate 808s and it's my least favorite Ye album. But TLOP is 4th/5th and LR is 2nd
59064,best perfume,I bought Lancôme La Vie Est Belle because I smelled it on a lovely looking woman on a flight. She passed me on the aisle and it smelled so amazing. I immediately asked her what it was and bought it asap. It has great staying power and I get lots of compliments!
61743,Best RPG game on PS4,"Yes. I don't really like anime much but I loved the game. It's strange at first because it's half turn-based combat RPG and half social simulator (going to school, hanging out with people to increase your rank with them, etc.), but it's just great."
21180,best workout music,"Lately it has been alot of club and dubstep for me. In particular the song Kyoto by Skrillex. Believe me, I'm not proud of it but when the bass drops... its like somebody presses the overdrive button on me and I just keep running, lifting, punching, whatever."
33709,best electric car,"I absolutely love mine. I almost never charge at public chargers, I just plug it into the wall socket at home overnight every few days to keep it topped up. My commute is only 10km on average though. A few days a week I have to drive an extra 50km but on those days I can (and sometimes do) charge at the VW dealer where I work. 

It’s a Golf and feels like a regular Golf. It’s super fun to drive, especially off the line. I haven’t had any issues with it, and haven’t had to buy gas in 7 months."
