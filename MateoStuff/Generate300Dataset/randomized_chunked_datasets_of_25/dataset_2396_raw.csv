"Thanks, I think that's the main reason bgg top looks like it does. People are excited about games and they don't play them enough to see throught their ""cracks"". I think a lot of us has been excited about first games of Catan, Carcassone, TtR etc. But we've played it so much that the ratings dropped. This is not the case with games like Twillight Imperium or Legacy games (because they are designed to be played once throught campaign)."
TIL there is a mountain near here named Nippletop...
"Kourtney can be a bitch now but I think she’s just had to resort to that, she’s been through some hard times. She gave so much to the show in the earlier seasons and does deserve a break"
Love that purple Total one in the gel. The minty freshness afterwards is so much more minty than most other toothpastes I've used
I haven’t used Digit…. but definitely will have a try and see how it’s going. Thanks for sharing.
They are holding their value really really well. You might only get 20% off after 3 years.
"Yes, it actually binds to both dirt and water carrying them both away down your basin's plug-hole.  This is described in words better than mine on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap#Overview ""Got to wash, wash that dirt away, got to wash, wash, wash that dirrrrrrt awaaayyy."")."
That makes sense!
Both consoles have dedicated hardware for SSD decompression.
"> to go hiking the Annapurna..

Funnily enough...this is on my short list :D

When you post on an internet forum you're bound to get some jackass saying the wrong shit...'tis the nature of the beast!"
It stays the way until you're done... or it resets to auto on its own while you're live?
I'll check it out! Thanks!
"Last I saw, not interested in trucks...
No truck to home... small battery.. vinyl. And on and on.. it's truly for commercial work.

As well, where I'm from you only have a truck if it can pay for itself. I just don't have the work for it.  Nor do I need a rolling cod piece... but that's me.."
"The 90s were such a simpler time. These days you'd have about 12 gopro's strapped to you, jump out of a plane with a mouthful of cinnamon while powering up a mobile device, do a bunch of flips trying to get better wifi signal, then once the big moment of you clicking that giant ""confirm order""button hits, you flash to white, then slowly fade back in to the increasing sounds of screams as you fall from the sky, having forgotten your 'chute, only to land safely on an ironically posed goat, have the mobile device land perfectly in one hand, your bobblehead in the other, and lashings of cash and boobs raining down as though you've just won some overhyped talent show.

fuck I miss my skateboard."
"I already gave her her present. Her sister, my aunt, developed lymphoma earlier this year, so she really needed to stay in close contact with the family.  The problem is that her cell phone was utterly horrible. It was a cheapo phone on a pay as you go service. It constantly dropped called and was useless to text and read emails on.

So I asked her if she wanted me to get her a phone and put her on my Verizon plan and call that her Christmas present. She said yes and is now the happy owner of an iPhone 6+. It ramped up my Verizon bill a good bit, but she's happy."
"Use your old phone, and one of many free pieces of software to make it a great webcam."
"I took my oldest daughter to say hello to him at Salt Lake Comic Con last weekend. I went up to say hello dressed like my Star Trek Online character and while he was pleasant enough, he seemed like he could care less I was there and said hello. I introduced my daughter to him as ""This little lady loves My Little Pony"" and his eyes lit up and he engaged her into a conversation about Discord; he seemed very pleased that she knew who he was."
"For me it's CK Obsession. He still manages to find it in stores somehow and it's just one of those smells I strongly associate with dad and is one I really like, too. His closet just smells faintly of it - it's awesome. 

I'm still looking for such a signature scent of my own. :c"
"In 2019 I upgraded my aging Iphone 6s after having it for four years to a new Iphone 11.  The first week I kept telling myself I should have upgraded a long time ago.  To this day, no regrets - love it.  If you consider how much you use your phone on a daily basis and the convenience/power it has, the price/use is still fairly low."
Exactly Ho could be like Tito!
"Both are good in it's own way. I think xbox is more powerfull and silent, while ps have better exclusive games."
"Sorry, didn't get it?"
"Ted Chiang's ""Stories of Your Life and Others"" would be a good candidate for this list. His stories make me *think* in a way most science fiction doesn't — his ideas are so, so original and really stretch beyond the tired tropes you find in other sci-fi."
Mint crashed for me so idk
"> Bring your drinking shoes.

Which reminds me: if a stranger there offers to bet you money that he can tell you where you got your shoes, he will win the money. Don't take the bet. Just trust me on this one."
