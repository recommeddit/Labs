13,"Ranger definitely starts to show it's slowness on older hardware for sure. I do like the features it offers, but it seems like it just gets more and more complicated to configure - nnn I like the idea of since you can add plugins for certain features.

That said, I believe there are file previews via nnn plug-ins now? Preview-tui I believe it's called. Pretty sure it just uses a multiplexor to give it a split pane for the previews.

15835,"One thing that I think can be added to the guide is where to buy them for cheap. ZeroUV is always an option, but I think you can get more bang for your buck getting luxury brands for way less then retail. Forgive me for the bad formatting, I'm typing this on my phone.

Nordstrom rack is a great place to start. You can try on every pair they have, even if discounted they still retail for hundreds. If you're looking for Ray-Bans, this is the place to go. They never have more popular styles like the Clubmaster or Erika, but they always have aviators, wayfarers, and various round frames priced from $80 to $100. Nordstrom rack also has a TON of designer glasses. Céline, Gucci, Prada, Balmain, Givenchy, Persol, etc. However they all still cost $100+ and are almost never polarized, so I would avoid them until the clear the rack sale starts so you can maybe snag a pair for less than $50. I highly recommend Shwood sunglasses if you can find a pair. They're made in Portland out of real wood and all of the pairs I've seen at Nordstrom rack are polarized. Great quality and really cheap. 

Next place to look is Saks off 5th. They have mainly designer sunglasses and the same stock of Ray-Bans as Nordstrom Rack, but their prices are usually lower and have constant sales throughout the year. I've had good luck with Céline, Saint Laurent, Oliver Peoples, and Balmain. All are very well made and have interesting styles. Also, none of them are made by luxottica, which is a plus. Only downside is most of the time they aren't polarized. I've had the best luck at Saks so if you're near one go scope it out. 

Now for the places you should avoid. Burlington, Marshall's, Ross, Neiman Marcus Last Call, and maybe TJ/TK Maxx. The first three will never have good sunglasses in stock, so they're a waste of your time. Last call has a small selection of crazy expensive shades like Cartier, so they're also not worth visiting. TJ Maxx also has a small selection of mostly junk, but very rarely you can find Persols, so sometimes it's worth looking. If you're overseas, though, TK Maxx has a CRAZY good selection of sunglasses at good prices and I'm jealous we don't have that in the states. 

I hope this helps!

Edit: Another point I forgot to mention. Let's say you found the perfect pair of sunglasses, but they aren't symmetrical(you can test this by laying them upside down. The end pieces should both be touching the ground). Still buy them! Many glasses stores, including Walmart, have machines to correct your glasses and some even do it for free!",best sunglasses for fashion

It's an interesting point, but I'd argue that it's more the result of the practical capabilities of the instrument.
