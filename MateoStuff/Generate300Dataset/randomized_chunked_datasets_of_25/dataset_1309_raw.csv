The Countryman is the only EV in the US market.
Diggs. But I think he is way (10-15 spots not 30) too high.  And probably Ramsey
"Yeah, there is a lot of drama surrounding it and the dev. Personally I don’t care. It’s pretty, fast and works well.

As for installing it on a jailbreak other than Electra/Chimera I would wait for it to go open source so it’s easier to maintain. The dev of Sileo doesn’t officially support it for other jailbreaks which is understandable."
Also Justified is a good series
"I've found Lowes has a better outdoor plant/garden selection. You also can't find anyone to help.  If you need a specific valve, fitting, screw, forget it.  Everything has been rummaged through and no longer in the appropriate box/area.  Also, they don't have self check-out and there is always someone in line at the one check-out aisle that is open that will try to return or argue about a coupon.

I mostly go to HD."
"> zsh or bash, amongst many others are quite powerful."
It's hard to be incognito when you're a giant sentient vegetable.
I got the battery replaced in my 8 and it runs like new. It was $50.
"I have the ZMI and for power, yeah, it's solid. I wish it were lighter but that's the trade-off (for now at least). It's 14oz which weighs as much as the bag I carry it in!"
"Agree. It was also better than S3, IMO."
Maybe he's neither and simply markets for Oral B..
"I agreed with this mostly.

I've been using fetch for a long time and only found and issue with it in the past week - fetch has no timeout. There are workarounds for this but they generally mean leaving the connection alive and just rejecting a wrapping promise which feels... dirty. 

Hope fully this short coming will be address in the future"
"Bruce Campbell. Awesome dude.

He signed my Army of Darkness poster 'Stay groovy - Ash'"
"That's tough, real tough. In no particular order I'd probably go with -

* The Tim Ferriss Show
* Planet Money
* 99% Invisible
* Hidden Brain
* Last Podcast On The Left
* Freakonomics Radio
* SinCast

That's actually 7, but those are the ones I'll stop other podcasts to listen to. None of them are fitness podcasts actually, but Tim Ferriss has interviewed Arnold, Patrick Arnold(the father of prohormones), along with other athletes and they're good episodes."
"Hash browns, and a bacon biscuit. Mmmhmmmm,"
"Full size candy bars. Anything without coconut - but I highly recommend you save those for the neighborhood kids. 

Otherwise, faster than you can say Twitter or Hobo Code - you'll be scooped out and run asunder by the advancing hoards."
This thread is an audiophile's worst nightmare....
"Came here to back up Athlete A. Not only does it follow the investigation and arrest of Dr. Larry Nassar, it also delves into the complete apathy that USA Gymnastics had for their athletes well-being as well as some insight to how sports culture (everywhere, but particularly in the US) can place value over achievement than well-being and safety.

Edit: it has a hell of a powerful ending too."
"I’ll second the ysl la nuit d’homme. I get more compliments on that than any other cologne. 

Also creed aventus is great but overhyped for the money. I don’t agree that the knockoff from armauf is the same."
Get a reverse osmosis system for like 300$

Thanks for sharing another great platform….."
Which languages are the big names?
Those colours...can't tell them apart. Being red-green colour deficient doesn't help either.
"A 50/50 combo of water and hydrogen peroxide is great for gingivitis for  short term use. As long as you don’t swallow it, it won’t hurt you."
He is certifiably \#Good.
