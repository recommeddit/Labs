I asked my wife and she said if she could get a brake from our 3 LOs, she would like to do something adults only with me like get dressed up a little, dinner and a museum or the theatre. She doesn't really like the spa idea or shopping much. We recently moved so she doesn't have many friends who are close; otherwise, maybe an outing with girlfriends would be nice. Long story short--she probably would just love a little time to reconnect with the non-mommy side of herself. Good luck.",best gifts for mom
47047,"No. Alcohol basically nukes the bacteria. I actually did a research project in high school where I was looking at survival rates of bacteria after hand sanitizer application. That 99.99 percent figure is basically just a way to cover your ass if someone gets sick, because my results showed that it killed basically everything.

I did get a neat side result though. It turns out that bacterial genetic material can survive and be picked up by new bacteria after hand sanitizer use.",best hand santizer brand

24092,"* **[Cowboy Bebop](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop)**:  Just one of the most classic anime series known.  People disagree, but for me it stands the test of time as a episodic style sci-fi western.  The dub is amazing, and really plays up the characters with great VA.
* **[Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect) & [OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16001/Kokoro_Connect:_Michi_Random)**: This supernatural Slice of Life had me hook, line, and sinker.  I loved every minute of its complex view into the problems that you face when you lose the ability to maintain your privacy.
* **[Durarara!!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara!!)**:  This show was one that hit me completely out of left field.  It had a stark juxtaposition of comedy, action, twisted plots, and super interesting characters.  One of the first that I watched and definitely a favorite.


* **[Mirai Nikki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/) & [OVA](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16762/Mirai_Nikki_Redial)**: This show is twisted, and I love it.  Such a great concept and the whole interaction by Yuki & Yuno made the experience.  
* **[Angel Beats](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!)**: This anime... It switches gears from comedy to romance, drama to music, with such sleekness that you never expect it, when it happens.  And just thinking about certain parts makes me smile, while others make me tear up. 

**Tied...**:

* **[Lovely★Complex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2034/Lovely%E2%98%85Complex)**: 
This RomCom has such a great chemistry between the two main characters and how their relationship develops.
* **[Golden Time](http://myanimelist.net/anime/17895/Golden_Time)**: This is the anime that got me into the romance genre.  So I am a little biased towards this one.  I admit the ghost Banri was annoying, but it helped push certain plot points during the series.  But really the romance between Banri and Kouko really pulled at  my heartstrings.",best anime

33604,"First off-I love your anti gas attitude. I’m right there with you. Based on your needs, id go for a used Bolt. They go for under $20k at just 3 years old. It’s a pretty practical commuter with decent range (238 miles) and charging (50kW) for regional trips if needed. All EVs have good warranty that go for 8 or 10 years depending on the State you live in. You could probably get by with Level 1 (120v or a regular outlet) overnight as it will give you about 60 miles range overnight. That charger comes with the car. Upgrading to Level 2 will cost you a few hundred. You won’t regret going EV.",best electric car
47935,"No, you're right in sense they kind of blend together with style (furniture, texture, etc...)

9372,"I asked them after dinner if they've ever  even bitten and they shrugged it off so casually I imagine it's not worth note. Although one of them did tell me they got bitten by a 30 year old woman a couple of days ago, a completely normal patient otherwise (at least I think,  they didn't say there was anything out of the ordinary about the lady). She was apologetic but I still find the idea amusing, I hope it was somewhat what you were looking for.",best toothpaste
