55372,best action and adventure novel series,"Company of Strangers sounds fun! and its cheap which is always a bonus :) I'll go look at some reviews/sample

The Copper promise is/was a DNF for me, its been sitting on 5% read for over 3 years now on my kobo, for no discernible reason. 

I read Shards of Honor, and I really didn't like that, the whole prisoner of war/captor to lovers, with the rape threats to the other non lucky lady sailors just never sat right with me, that i'm not that interested in picking up other Vorkosigan books."

72212,best adblocker extension,This is bad advice. Ublock Origin doesn't do heuristic analysis and won't receive updates as quickly for known malware. Plus if someone just uploads the malware to a new url you lose all protection.

32352,best hotel to live in,"LOTS of prostitution and all the drama/legal trouble that goes along with it. Corporate functions like conventions, parties, etc where there's an open bar almost always leads to something fucked up happening. One hotel I worked at hosted a Christmas party for an investment firm and two guys started jockeying for the affections of a female coworker. They all wound up on an elevator together and the guys started fighting, the elevator went in to safety lock down, we had to call the PD and the FD. One guy went in a squad car, one guy went in an ambulance, we had to give the woman some clothes from lost & found because he dress was covered in blood and the elevator was out of service for six hours to clean it up.
There's always a ton of back of house drama, too. Especially among the execs and the junior managers. Affairs, backstabbing, a little light fraud. You know, the usual."

529,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"I just took a look at it (I wanna try *everything free* before shelling out cash just for school).

It looks promising, but there are some obvious issues. I *have* to run it via terminal, because MacOS requires apps request permissions to access things like the desktop, and even after granting full disk access, it doesn't know what to do with itself.

It *can* markup PDFs, and can also export (yes!). It is a decent bit laggy when using my drawing tablet, which is annoying, but I think I can manage.

Thank you for the suggestion!

\[Edit\]

If I move the file to my `~/Public` folder, and don't run it as root, drawing is *much* better. I'll just have to see if I can fix the folder access issue, haha."
59832,best perfume,"> I also like Ralph by Ralph Lauren

45351,best gaming system,"I prefer the PC but have tried all consoles. I own the PS4 but also want to buy a Switch and sometimes a Xbox seems also interesting. It depents (in my eyes) what you want to play or if you want to play while you are on the bus or train. So if you like games like  Horizon:Zero Dawn, Detroit:Become Human, etc you HAVE to buy a PS4. If you like Forza Horizon, Halo etc you HAVE to buy a Xbox and for the Mario titles and maybe the coming PokÃ©mon games -> Switch. And then there is the  Point where you don't mind at all about the aaa-only titles therefore i would prefer the xbox.  
1. The controler (in my eyes) ist realy nice and feels great  
2. You can play some titles with your friends on the PC (Halo Wars, Sea of Thieves, ?Forza Horizon?)  
3. It is the better console (not because i hate PS4 ... i love the Playstation style) but if you read down the Hardware what is in the Xbox One X you can see that the XOX has better stuff in it that the PS4Pro   
( 4. It has the best Graphics (without Mods) on Monster Hunter World )"
