65028,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,No way should La Super Rica be on this list. Is that restaurant ever mentioned without name dropping Julia Child? Give me a break. El Bajio down the street is infinitely better.

67608,axios alternatives reddit,"I guess the argument is that you're gonna end up with 10 different libraries where you don't care about the size. Then you're at 140kb uncompressed (which is also code that your browser has to parse etc, so it's not just about download speeds). Add onto that React and your actual application code, and well. It's easy to end up with quite a bit bundle, and then you have to do some more obstructive solutions like code splitting, etc.

That's all theoretical, of course, I've also never worried about including axios in my code."

4336,best text editor,Komodo Edit and Notepad++ are both fantastic.
32266,best hotel to live in,"I used to work at a hotel when I was maybe 20 where this man came in with two young women (definitely teens) and never let them speak, they'd come back somewhat bruised. Then he started coming in with other men (and the girls) everything paid in cash.

My manager said ""it happens. Leave it""

A woman told me the next morning she thinks she was raped by the same men. She woke up naked in her room beat up and with pain in her genitals after having drinks with them.
Management again, ""leave it. She's crazy and was drunk""

So I called the police and corporate and left that day.

Detective called me a couple days later for a report and to come in and ID the man (as well as some 'customers' of the man. Turns out the girls were underage and ""not from here"" is all I was told.
Manager was investigated as a participant and fired.

9163,best toothpaste,"and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's the scrubbing action/friction that removes pathogens when you wash your hands isn't it, not so much the use of soap?"
46104,best trick or treating candy,"I'm 100% with you. The fact that one night a year, through no fault of your own, a bunch of kids will just show up at your door and demand candy, then either judge you on the candy you give them or throw eggs at your house if you don't give them anything... that's ludicrous. We've got a similar tradition in Germany, not for Halloween but for Saint Martin's Day, where instead of throwing eggs at your house, kids sing shitty carols at you. It makes me sort of glad I'll never be able to afford a house lol."

2939,best webcamera,"The reason Webcams in laptops are so terrible is the limited space for a lens assembly. Cell phones are thicker the lid of most notebooks, plus, they can get away with camera bumps. without a lens assembly, the size of the sensor becomes limited too, and auto-focus is not possible either. I'm not sure if it was Linus or Hardware Canucks who made a video about that."
