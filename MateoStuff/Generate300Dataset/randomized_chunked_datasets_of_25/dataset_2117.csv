18120,best Kardashian,"Right Kim invited her, but not Khloe or Lamar. It was theyâ€™re one year anniversary so Khloe probably only invited close family and friends. Snooki was none of that to her so Kim should have told Khloe in advance instead of letting her be caught off guard while drunk."

14613,best romantic novel,"Author, not book, but I definitely pause a lot and think ""is this particular Sarina Bowen book *really* responsive, or do I just really like Sarina Bowen and want to smash one of her books until it fits the gap someone is asking for?""
