73396,best battery bank,"Second the RAVPower PD. It's no joke in size and weight, but it's super dependable. I love being able to charge so many different kinds of USB-C devices from it (phone, Switch, Chromebook, laptop)."
53351,best usb c charging cable,"One thing I think they miss here is the Aukey braided nylon cables, they‚Äôre the only brand I‚Äôve been able to find USB-C, Lightning, Micro, and multi cables with the same design across all types, which if your OCD about your desktop setup like I am, it makes a difference."
51284,best iphone case,I‚Äôm trying them this year as well so hopefully they‚Äôre as good as their price demands
22118,best celebrity,"A scoopsie, patata"
49059,best gaming monitor,I cannot stress enough that I dont reccomend an asus monitor. They seem to have no quality control whatsoever and it is a coin toss whether you get a monitor that works properly or not.
27729,best bollywood actor,Akshay Kumar as a deshbhakt Indian.
11612,best gifts for dad,I might get my dad something like this. He helped me in a tight financial spot a few weeks ago.
51676,best iphone case,"Careless the majority of the time, apple clear case when I want a little more protection."
37550,best amusement park,"Twister is great, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs one of the best in the world."
55976,best action and adventure movie,"As I mentioned elsewhere, the applause may have been more for Gilliam, for finally finishing the picture."
37156,best amusement park,"Don't forget the launch coaster coming to SWO as well. The BGT & SWO combo is strong even without the two additions, I can't wait to get back out there next year."
56164,best action and adventure movie,Not sure if this counts but I felt this way about 1917. The whole movie takes place over a couple of days and the whole time you are just IN IT. The fact that it's shot to all look like a single take lends to this. It feels like you are watching continuous motion with no interruption which makes it feel very real and in the moment if that makes any sense.
62740,Best Data Science textbook,"It's clear that he's missing the mentality that a lot of statisticians and mathematicians have especially when he makes pronouncements about his models and how ""good"" they are when he and his team refuse to reveal how they work which implies he has something to hide. He talks a ton in his book about how he predicted the results in ""all 50 states"" as to which would vote Romney or Obama in the 2012 election but any good statistician knows that one success hardly proves the model and foolish to pretend so. He also never lets on that he understands concepts in statistics that are considered more advanced such as information theory, different types of norms, the bootstrap, etc although this could feasibly be because he is trying to make his work ""accessible"". I think it's very telling that he was once a SABERmetrician and proselytized his model called PECOTA - I don't think any practicing statistician regards such models as rigorous.

8068,best toothpaste,Nope still here
12169,best gifts for dad,"You may be being rhetorical. But in case you're not, it's the whole ""thought that counts"" thing. The implication is if I get you cash I'm saying ""I have no clue what to get you."" But if I know you love antiques and I get you a gift card to the local antique gallery. Then I'm saying ""I know you well enough to know you like antiques and will love this present."" Or (for a real life example), I know my fianc√©e needed new makeup but I also knew I had no fucking clue what to get. So I got her a Sephora gift card. She was able to get exactly what she wanted anyway, and there was an added bonus of showing I can pay attention to her and pick up on things she may need as a gift."
17789,best Kardashian,I would put Kourtney after Kylie. She completely lacks empathy yet demands it from others. She lacks self awareness and is very judgmental.
52805,best hiphop album,I liked You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're  Having much more than Lemons.
63711,best books for time management reddit,The 4-hour work week - Timothy Ferriss
47764,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"I still have my ti 83 plus from 2006, would that one work? I just remembered I had it and loaned it to someone. I will be requesting it back."
39588,best podcast for biologists,"You might like the [microbe.tv](http://www.microbe.tv/science-shows/) family of podcasts (This Week in Virology/Evolution/Microbiology etc.). They generally require more background knowledge than Hardcore History as their format tends to be a discussion of recent academic papers, but they‚Äôre more accessible than reading the papers themselves and go into a high level of detail on the particular subject."
6754,best iPhone,I know. I remember.
8950,best toothpaste,Have you heard of MI Paste? Father is a highly regarded cosmetic dentist and absolutely swears by the stuff.
54571,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"This is a great question! Depends on how much you really love pads... I mean for me I'd do it, but that's cause I spent, obviously, tons of money üòÇ. The way I view it, I know it will get used all the time so it gets the money's worth and outside of shidenkai, they'll all last me for years. Also the market is pretty easy to sell them if you need.

But I'm not sure of your situation. If you're just looking for something solid and can get an Aqua control plus cheaper, I'd probably do that. Ac+ is my universal pick for something other than artisan, but truly I think one big purchase of artisan gets you into end game üëç.

Where are you that it costs that much? Maybe you can buy one on r/mousemarket cheaper used?"
27155,best board games,Woah. This is neat.
