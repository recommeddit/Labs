"How do you pick ten when you've seen over six hundred is the question...

The ones that stand out the most for me are probably Banana Fish, Dr. Stone, Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, Fate series, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Code Geass, Fruits Basket, Toradora, Noragami and call me stupid, but I bawled my eyes out when I finished Rurouni Kenshin. It took a while for me to move on from that one."
I ask this sincerely as a Cal grad: is there a source for this? I’d like to learn more
"My response after reading this, at my desk was to whisper *siiiighhhhh* ""Jesus... Here we fuckin go."""
"Made the mistake of stopping at the ""Digital Phone Company"" kiosk in the Lakenheath BX right when I got here. They can *only* get you set up with Vodafone. Just wait till you can get to Bury to visit the O2 or Three store. 

EDIT: Just switched from Vodafone to Three. Was paying 39 pounds per month  and am now paying 12.90 per month. That's 200 minutes, 5000 texts, and unlimited data. (That's if you own your phone, which I do). 

For those using ctl+f: raf lakenheath feltwell mildenhall."
"Couple things I would change about this. 

1. ""Are you a fan of vintage/retro products"" has no merit, and I don't quite understand how that would make me buy a Buckling Spring over a MX Green...

2. MX Clears have a much larger tactile bumb then browns, they aren't just heavier due to the spring.

3. I wouldn't include Ergo Clears on the list. If you do you should also include Panda Clears, and Ghetto Greens, and all of the other combinations.

4. Although it is heavily debated (when it comes to the very very small differences), the Blue, Red, and Brown switches are all ""Light"" springs. 

5. Although I wouldn't bother adding ALPS, you should definitely add Topre switches.

6. The force of the switch is not increased when you are going over the tactile bump. The spring is providing the same force it just takes more force to get over the bump. (even what I wrote is confusing, I know what you are trying to say but I just mean the wording on the chart is a little too confusing)

7. Red and Black switches are both very popular for gaming. Many people prefer the heavier linear springs to the light springs."
Sweet cream from cold stone. Don’t you dare add anything to it.
"Thanks for the correction, I wasn't aware of that!"
"Yes. I compared 5-year average indexes of major parks in each state, and recorded the ones with the highest index."
"Do you ever tire of hearing people want to do this because they ""like games?"" I feel like that's gotta be a really common theme among people who *can't* cut it in that industry."
Got it. baby-like vague replicas.
Oooh i like this one a lot
Found the Minnesotan!
"My girlfriend wanted to watch cartoons last night so we watched that. I've been getting schwifty since then. She's so pissed at herself for that suggestion, especially when I tell her to take off her panties and shit on the floor."
Heynckes treble winning team were something else!
It's really a shame how many people don't know about Matchstick Men.
"Warranty it ?

I've only had the PB2S with fast charging and it's great

I imagine also if there's an issue with the cells (like an unprotected cell shorting out or something?) It could fry the charger ?"
My cat drives me crazy! She's always has to be near me unless my dog is outside and then she cries and cries until the dog comes in. She also loves to play and will come when called. If there is something new in the house she has to check it out.
:)  It is mostly when I am doing stuff for work or grad school and need to use my home computer (Mac).
I think it's an awesome book.  I recommend that every data professional read it.  Not because of the material as much as because of how well Nate Silver communicates complicated mathematical information in a way that a layman can easily understand it.  There's a reason why he's the most famous statistician on the planet.
"Still. It's frozen, so you might be able to get a cooler or a few coolers for when that happens. I would say to wait until the freezer is empty, but most people I know with a 2nd freezer never have it empty"

The sensor is quite similar to the g pro wireless right?
">I found them to be hard, annoying and whit infinity life,

Ok let's start with hard part, that is **easily** fixed by getting a faster car because your stock starter car is really not good

""Annoying"" uhh you played any NFS game that has cops in them? Cops are literally designed to be annoying 


>whit infinity life

You kill/disable them they don't have god mode"
"""Where is your God"" and ""Deceiver of the Gods"" are amazing for deadlifts"
