"I used to read romance when I was younger and liked the YA genre. My favorite one is the series Vampire Academy and Dimitri and Rose from there... Cheasy, I know :D

I don't read romance anymore tho, I'm not saying it's bad but I feel that if I read other genres I can learn more from them."
"I hate to bash on George Lucas, but it'll also be the first Indiana Jones film without him."
"Not an English native, what do you mean by 'white glove'?"
"This is taken from either Fish Hawk Cliffs or Indian Head, just can't recall which one gives you this perspective (they're essentially right next to each other). That is lower Ausable Lake you're looking at. Access to this section of the High Peaks is through the Ausable Club. Feel free to hit me up with any questions. 

*edit* I got dumb"
"I suggest you to wait iPhone 12's realeas because prices of 11 and XR will drop, not a good move buying a new iPhone in August imo"
"Wrong, Oliver peoples have better lenses and frames than most of Luxottica's other offerings. Not ""worth""  the premium, but the quality is clearly better."
I used to only have these specific adidas ankle socks but they stopped selling them/changed them. It was a very sad day.
"I switched my prepaid Acct to esim by going into a B&M store.  The rep was able to do the swap, I think it cost $6."
get what you pay for.
"Nigga fuck off. Polite as shit. I am done, else imma start losing my shit in this bitch."
"Beautiful descriptions! The last one sounds so dreamy, I’d never heard of it but I’m extremely tempted to try it based on those 2 lines alone"
Arm and Hammer has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in it. That would be a terrible thing for him to switch to.
"TAKEN

An Icelandic Broadchurch."
I’m halfway through The Making of a Murderer. Seriously WTF was going on there?
I get that. I went years without even listening to new music. But I don’t really enjoy watching tv and movies and I only play one video game so I have tons of free time and am hungry for new music.
"From what I understand they were released from contract for other obligations until they were ready to re-up for season 3. It hasn’t been officially cancelled, but also hasn’t been officially slated. Idk if that makes any difference but it gives me a small amount of hope. That was one of the best series I’ve ever watched!"
I love my lunarglides! They're so comfortable....
Uruguay should be a lot higher
I’d give it a 4.8
"I would love to know if that "" Zero water"" filtration system is as legit as they claim. I seriously doubt it though."
Totally agree.
"I thought it worked best when the episode was about a specific cast member/""antagonist"" around Jordan"
"FT sucks, between the distance, location, and shit food it is by far the worst dorm, well San Mig is pretty bad also. I would recommend going for one of the shorties(Santa Cruz, Anacapa , Santa Rosa) the rooms are the biggest most people are in doubles, and they are close to the water and the dinning commons. My first year was in Santa Cruz and the dorms themselves were great. Plus as an engineer must of your classes will be near the shorties, and will getting to and from a lot easier."
I should emphasize that I recommend listening to all the commentaries because the go over a lot about the arc of the MCU and how each movie changed people's expectations. Plus Ben's reaction to seeing them for the first time.
"I have a big ass chef's knife, a Victorinox.  Cost me like $35 at the time, and I'm sure it is still well under $100.  It is a beast.  That became my workhorse, fast."
