26801,best board games,"To be fair I think Catan is just super dated. I know lots of people still love it and there's a bit of nostalgia for it still with myself as well but so many games do what Catan does but better now. And there's also much better games for getting people into the hobby now. Ticket to ride is my personal favorite game to get people into the hobby. Pandemic has always been pretty excellent and the theming is more relevant than ever.


I don't think I'd ever recommend someone pick up Catan now unless you already love it."
33778,best electric car,"> Imo In five years there will be little reason to choose anything else for a general runabout. 

I think we're already there, if you are a homeowner or have charging at your off-street parking space."
16492,best sunglasses for fashion,"> Maui Jim is the only brand whose lenses are proven to prevent skin cancer around the eyes!

This is amazing! Thanks so much for sharing!"
36490,best alcoholic drink,"I've been told several times by several different bartenders that I would have normally been cutoff by the sixth LIIT, but they all said that I'm surprisingly not being an asshole.....yay, me!"
33782,best electric car,"Define “success” for track

In the R&T test, the P3D pulled huge amount of power after a few laps in cool weather conditions.

It’s more of a fast commuter car, not good for track days. No camber adjustment, skinny tires, undefeatable nannies, heavy understeer bias, inadequate cooling for long term durability, not that fast after a few laps, charging is impossible or inconvenient.

They are amazing for autocross though. Usually there’s a sharp turn right after starting line. The P3D just accelerates through it like it is on rails. Perfect “gearing” and great visibility for cones."
70957,best movies with a cool twist,"the man from  earth, and parasite!SO GOOD"
14031,best place to get free books,Great!!
55503,best action and adventure novel series,**The City Stained Red** by Sam Sykes! It honestly feels like a Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale game come to life in the form of a wickedly fun book.
31763,best hotel to live in,"1.  That movie got me to briefly concentrate on memberships and points, but I fell out of it.  I'd like to focus my energy elsewhere.   Great film though.  I thought it should have gotten praise for the script.
2.  I'd be afraid to.  First thing I always do is buy Lysol spray and wipes.  I hit the whole room and throw the comforter on the floor (they don't wash those things)."
63028,Best online React course,He is indeed! Liked his course way above Grinders'
5133,best home improvement store,"My dad is a contractor and he calls it ""blows"""
31897,best hotel to live in,"Yes, much cheaper. Even a serviced apartment would be cheaper for a similar standard."
22994,best celebrity,"Man, what a guy. 

I hope you took the cash and had a week with your wife dude."
26262,best politician,"I don't love Goldwater, but I do respect his views on the separation of Church & State:
>There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs. There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both."
4333,best text editor,"Just to be different than all the Notepad++ people: [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html). I like my text editors to edit text, not code, by default, so I like them to be as unobtrusively Notepad-like as possible.

Basically, take Notepad and drop in more menu entries/keyboard shortcuts for common text manipulation tasks, simple line numbering and code highlighting. That's it.

I actually like it just because it's the only text editor (besides Notepad itself) *without* tabs--I don't live in my text editor, so I don't want it to think it should own every text file I open. It should be small enough that there can be one instance of it open for every file open."
52881,best hiphop album,"Only 1 song i dont like is Brackets, cant really relate to it tbh. But every other song on KOD is absolutely amazing. Sentimental value towards Friends as well. 

Couldnt put his mixtapes because OP said albums. TBH it feels wrong to try and compare any of his albums. Theyre all great in their own right. But to me this is his most aesthetically pleasing album. I did cry during 4YEO, the song, so dont get me wrong I love that one too :)"
42999,best detective show,"1983 (polish series) a very underrated but highly rated series. A great political thriller with nice acting and stunning cinematography. Idk, why no one doesn't talk about this series.  Worth watching."
30422,best Mexican war to study,"The royal we, of course."
41004,best instrument to play,"There is no ""easiest instrument."" They're all challenging in their own unique ways, though it is true that the more instruments you learn, the easier it becomes to pick up new ones. 

That being said, here are my opinions:

Easiest rock instrument: drum kit because you don't have to worry about pitch very much

Easiest orchestra instrument: probably also drums

Easiest marching band instrument: cymbals

Easiest overall: if a kazoo counts, it's totally the easiest. There's lots of small mouth instruments that are pretty easy such as pitch pipes, harmonicas, and Jew harps

Easiest string instrument: gonna go with picked electric bass"
41416,best instrument to play,"My point is that asking ""How long does it take to be good"" is not a useful question because you need to consider time practicing. Not just time in general."
44445,best items under $100,"If you have pets it’s also worth paying the little extra for the specialized vacuum. 

I used regular vacuums for years before switching over to one of the pet hair vacuums and holy shit it takes like half the time.

Edit: For everyone asking for recommendations, I swear by Bissel’s Pet Hair Eraser. They’ve got both upright and handheld models, some more expensive than others, but I have one of each (upright and handheld) and didn’t pay over $100 for either of them. They’re an absolute godsend."
54101,best medicine for a cold,"Zinc + Vitamin C + Soup + Cold medicine of your choice.

Vicks vapor rub if you're really congested."
31246,best country to live in,Australia.
70955,best movies with a cool twist,"I really like these kinds of movies too, I would recommend The Machinist.  It follows a man (Christan Bale) who quickly descends into insomnia-induced paranoid delusions and hallucinations.  It was very unsettling and really made me feel like I was also going crazy.  Excellent movie."
39175,best web browser,I agree. so firefox is the only safe browser at the moment.
