"You either are deliberately obtuse, or don't understand my initial point.

I have been able to find jobs without living in the country and already having a visa many times. That is how I moved to Japan, China, Germany, etc. Sometimes it was through international job searches where they then provided me with a visa, and other times with school or working holiday visas that did not require company sponsorship. There are some countries, however, that make it very complicated to find work from abroad without having an extremely specific set of skills. My current search for work in Switzerland is turning out that way, as well as a few others in the past. A lot of places make it very hard to get a visa without a job, and nearly impossible to get a job without a visa."
"The carnage was largely the result of this war being one of the first to ""benefit"" from the Industrial Revolution.  Improved gunnery led to incredibly horrific results when combined with direct assaults.  General Longstreet was smart to consider the defensive methods, particularly trench warfare, but that was not ""acceptable"" because it appeared cowardly.

Consequently, when WWI broke out, these tactics were not initially employed.  The advent of machine guns (firstly the Gatling gun) changed all that.

It is also why Hitler's Panzers shocked the world with their *blitzkreig* strategy.  After the bogged-down situation of WWI, it was widely understood that defensive warfare would win out over any kind of fire-and-movement.  As a result, the French were convinced their Maginot Line would stop any German assault.  When Poland fell to Germany in little more than a month, it heralded a new technology to trump the ""old-new"" technology, that of tanks over machine guns."
"I'm glad you like it.  I'm surprised too that Gintama didn't make the top 100, but it was only on 4 of the 33 lists.  You might like the [Animetacritic list](http://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/).  Gintama is #52."
"The Prestige, imo. It blindsided my brother the first time (I had it spoiled for me) but in second watch the clues are all laid out so well"
"Ang dami palang apps based on the comments, right now I am using MoneyManager. Had to pay premium of 250 pesos to get rid of ads and to unlock all configurations. Happy with it so far. Tried the YNAB before but it was too complicated and clustered for me plus the mknthly subscription fee just doesn't appeal to me."
agreed.  I grew up in Oregon but went hiking in the northern Adirondacks a couple weeks ago...incredibly beautiful
What happened? Canâ€™t find anything on the internet about this.
"Yeah it's pretty straightforward, if you can't afford Â£600 then get the Dell. I couldn't, so I did, and not disappointed. There's a reason it's popular."
I was surprised with the bathroom remodeling options when I was there yesterday. I wanted everything in that aisle haha. Controlling my spending over the next month is going to be a struggle!
"I saw this here years ago but it cracks me up so much. This personal chef teaches people how to make a three cheese blend for pizza and is totally straight faced during it. [Video here](https://youtu.be/nfxpwbWBNuU)

The same guy also has a video for cutting a pizza into 6 slices and cutting a pizza with scissors."
"(: hello! Thank you so much for this beautiful list of gaming laptops! 
I need help finding a laptop please! My budget is around $1100-1399 and Iâ€™m looking for a laptop thatâ€™s gonna be great for gaming, portable and long life expectancy. I was looking at the MSI GL65 leopard with the RT2070 and 512ssd for $1399 on Amazon. 
Thank you again!"
Felt like I had to comment! Another pharmacist fragrance lover!!! ðŸ¤—
"Season 1 isn't bad, just a different feel than the other seasons.  It focuses more on the ""case of the week"" and less on the overall story that they are trying to tell.  The problem with skipping season 1 is that it has a lot of character stuff that is important in later seasons."

"Barry Goldwater.  I have a thing for people who aren't afraid to speak the truth when the truth is not popular or acceptable.  Goldwater held firm to his conservative ideals in a time where conservatism was in exile, and the result of his being the political face of the conservative movement (and taking an absolute shellacking in his presidential bid) was a conservative movement that's been strong for the last 30+ years. 

In the same vein, I've become appreciative of Calvin Coolidge in recent years, especially following the biography released about him a few years back.  He saw the Depression coming, he understood the problems that would be faced, and he did a great job as president when necessary.  I don't know if we'll see another president like him, frankly."
"I'm not sure what is the *best* sounding.  But I have to say, I really do love the sound of the bagpipes and steel drums..."
Come have some cajun grub in New Orleans!
