"Love the longer descriptions! We definitely have some overlap, ha ha, and some others that are very different. Nice to see a bit of Fragonard - didn't realise Eclat was discontinued but it was such a likeable scent; too bad. I used to love J'adore until someone stole it out of my locker in high school 🥺 

Really want to try Heeley Chypre someday; they're an interesting house!"
"Dream Quest!!

The rogue-like CCG to rule them all.  Makes STS seem like child’s play."
"I had a similar experience with Cloud Atlas. Took me three times over the course of a year to get through Pt 1, but once I did, I was intrigued with the shifting style.

But once you hit the halfway point, it's non-stop roller coaster. The first half is just that slow climb.

One of my favorite books of the 21st century."
"[`got`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) has by far the most sane API.

They are responding to support issues quickly.

It is feature rich.

No complaints."
You guys should get the Santa Barbara Axxess card. Def worth having if your new to the area and will expose you to different places with the benefits of savings.
"Haha. We are in the Wano Arc. Big mom is yet to be introduced to the Kaido Pirates. Apoo is currently fighting Captain Kid, Luffy, and Zoro. Luffy and Zoro could not figure how to defend.   


Luffy got mad over red bean soup and blew their cover. But yes, we are still lying. One piece is a 7 at best."
"I fully support two bowls, hidden behind wherever you keep them.  One filled with pleasant nice candies for kids to enjoy and remember your house as the awesome one for trick or treating, and one with shitty generic crap like unlabeled hard candy and knockoff stale chocolates for teenagers who go around without costumes to be sad and stop stealing the fun from the children.  If possible, see if you can find some very low quality store that has really really old candy, maybe from the prior year."
Hahaha I laughed so hard! Takes such skill to show a character like piglet in such a state omg
"Woah, wtf? Where did that come from lol Did you mean to reply to someone else? Literally not a thing you just said was stated by me. In no way did I say anything like “I’m right you’re all wrong” lol. I think you’re reading non-existent things. 

Oh and what in the world do you mean by “ignoring evidence”? All I said was that when new shit comes out, its immediately called “the best thing in the MCU”. Period. It happens. If you don’t think so then you’re the one “ignoring evidence” because all those posts are still on here. 

The movie was great, I loved it. I just don’t think its “majority have it in their top 5”, especially after a month or when Eternals comes out. Theres no reason for you to start throwing around “arrogant and dense”. That’s completely uncalled for."
"facts man - go cheap when starting out - because you never know if you are actually going to like it - I had one friend that got affiliate then he was like that's good enough for me, I really don't care for streaming."
"Great story. How does that work, anyway? The whole sending someone a drink thing. Did you choose a drink for him or tell the waiter to serve him another of what he already had? What color neck tie was he wearing? Did you shake or kiss his hand?"
Cool thanks!  From what I'm reading they are 5.0 equivalent.  I came from Vibrams so I'm hoping for a 3.0 or less in the near future.  Currently rocking some 3.0 Free's (black on black soft cloth) and these have as close to minimalist feel without the fashion crime of my Vibrams. lol
"> The Great Suspender

is simply great. currently 45 tabs open, 90% in sleep modus (a couple are my regulars, many are for read later)  and RAM is not full."

"initially the preinstalled backgrounds, I'm not kidding, but then just felt comfortable with Manjaro and I stopped distro-hopping"
So that would be a stool stool?

"Oh man, I've been in houses like this!!  I always felt I should have been charged admission."
"Agreed! I laugh every time James says ""freaky!"" in his unique style haha."
Hestra gloves are awesome!
Impossible to not get hyped up during that intro
"Bongos, and then demonstrate by playing her bongos for her."
