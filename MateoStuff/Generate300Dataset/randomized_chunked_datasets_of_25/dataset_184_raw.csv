Too many mad people. Most are indifferent about AC Milan.
Another con is the sheer amount of finance grads there are.
"Heyo mashed potato! A couple of things I notice missing:

1) The Red Pocket $30/year plan for Sprint-network devices available through eBay only. 

2) Red Pocket automatic activation promo for Sprint devices on the 10GB plan - first month is $3 and you can change any time to a lower cost plan before your “almost free” month expires.

I was going to write a Reddit post blog-style about both, but maybe I’ll leave that to you for your site 😃

I have been testing different older Sprint devices (Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy SIII, HTC ONE M8, etc) with stock ROMs vs custom ROMs using RedPocket as the carrier."
"awww, go get some tissue."
I imagined this perfectly
"OLED is superior in many ways to FALD (including mini-LED as far as I have seen) but it is susceptible to burn in. Aside from that, I agree the CX is a very good product and the price is fair compared to what mini-LED is commanding. Even with a high number of zones, FALD has noticeable blooming in some situations. It's a kludge compared to OLED. Hopefully there will be computer-oriented desktop OLED panels soon, 48"" is still pretty huge."

Spicy foods.
"The comment I was responding to stated:

> Just because The Economist is willing to occasionally lampoon ""the jackass or the elephant"" does not mean they do not have a bias. They do a really great job of pretending their economic assumptions and precepts are not also political.


The evidence I presented was that consensus in economics is based on evidence, not politics. 

Do you take issue with using evidence?"
Be very careful with Zinc. There are loads of side effects that only some people experience.
"Thanks, but that's not USB 3-USB 3.0"
we get it you begged to be a part of the team.
"I'm surprised by the gummy worms. I didnt think they came in ""fun size"""
Couldn't have said it better myself.
I’m with you. Upgraded from the 8+ to an 11 Pro Max and don’t really notice any benefit from the OLED screen.
Used market is your friend.
"You can also check out kuler.adobe.com  for triads,  monos and complimentary."
"You can always save, save, save and then have enough to live out the next 20 years of your life as a park ranger, depending on how you spend your money and what amenities you choose to live with/without."
I got a webcam for 50 cents at a church’s fair and sure its grainy at times but that’s it. It’s great
"Ooh, great suggestion! Definitely second this one!"
"Worse help and better selection, count me in."
"I got a 27GL83A-B, which is nearly identical to the 27GL850 and I absolutely love it. My only regret is not getting two of them to replace my second monitor."
"I get the NY Times everyday, thanks to my neighbor being a delivery guy (there are always a few left over that otherwise just get junked). I rarely read the thing, tho. I get most of my news online. They just pile up until I have a moment to pull out the special sections (Tuesday Science rocks!) and I read through them in the bathroom. 

The only paper I actually read through is our local freebie, the Mountain Xpress. It covers local politics, culture, happenings, opinions and other local interest stuff. The writing's good and it's all stuff that's actually relevant to me on a day-to-day basis. It gets read cover to cover. Other than that, not so much."
Amaretto and Sprite tastes like cream soda. Amaretto is usually like 28% but if you’re throwing them back like regular sodas it’ll get you there pretty quickly.
