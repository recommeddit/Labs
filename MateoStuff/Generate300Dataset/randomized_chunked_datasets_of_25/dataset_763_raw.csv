"Same boat here - love the 598, want something wireless, but I also want the felt pads. I haven’t seen any good wireless headphones with felt pads."
"Most songs by sabaton. Strike witches, 40;1, and wehrmacht are personal favorites."
That's what I figured. Awesome.
"If being real is gatekeeping rock on.

Trust me im not expecting the gaming community to have financial reasoning, when ya'll whine and moan about gaming rigs when you cant save a thousand dollars if your lives depended on it.

Like you don't understand that the 15 minutes is up on the whole graphics cards are expensive, everyone understood the conditions of why, and the market has moved on....

Especially the secondary markets.....

If you cant manage to find a good deal under 700$ on a 2080, 2070 super, or 3060, I dont know what you want.

A fucking small violin to play while we caress your foreheads and comfort you through the fact you cant buy a 3060 for 350$ and have to pay double for something you couldnt produce if your life depended on it?

Pc gamers have become the most entitled little rat face creatures...

Thats why i fucking said get the money or shut up.

If your so smart why dont you produce graphics cards and ship them worldwide and solve all the future problems of all microchips for everybody.

Sitting around and whining about prices doesnt change the fact someone is getting a deal right now on a graphics card that you're all MSRP crying about."

GT4 for the PS2 was the last one i remember like that.

"I've seen him in person and I dint know how they worked with him. It must have been like herding cats. He's not rude, he just seems uninterested in fine details, much like Jack."
"I know it's probably less convenient than the big chains, but there are lots of places locally that carry awesome quality products, they just specialize by category. Might check out plumbing supply stores for your particular issues. I also love Fusek's True Value for a lot of home repair supplies/parts."
Been using this case since my iPhone 7 Plus. Solid cases
"Maybe not production in terms of beats but I really think as a whole in terms if production and mixing my favorite is Habits & Contradictions - Schoolboy Q.

Just the way his vocals are so crisp and bounce back from one another idk. It's just REALLY good imo I can't explain it."
"Agreed. I’m surprised none were nominated in the LGBTQI category. I will say, when I look for books I don’t see many F/F books as options. M/M is much easier to find. I really have to search out the F/F ones. Kind of sad."

"So, bought a torras without thinking about MagSafe. Ordered a SuperOne(?) with MagSafe and it’s a nice color, changes from blue to purple in light"
"Lol there you are, way at the bottom. 

I'm an Electrical Engineer that started in design and now does quality work for electronics manufacturing. 

Pros: Just like any engineering degree, you don't have many ""slow"" days, there's always a new challenge.  Pay is very good, even at entry level, it's extremely competitive.

Most importantly (for me), flexibility, you can do so much with degree. Because of the critical thinking skills required, it's often a prefered degree for law enforcement, FBI, etc.  If you live in an engineering/manufacturing dense area,  there's always new opportunities if you get bored or if your pay plateaus. Also, you learn to self educate. There's just way too much to shove in a 4-5 year degree. You have to be self driven to continue learning, because it'll require so much during school, it'll come second nature at work. 

Cons:  School work sucked a big bag of dicks, but worth it in the end. I don't have too many. I've very much enjoyed my work. Design was fun while it lasted. I've really enjoyed the Quality path. My hours are pretty average 9-10/day.  It can be frustrating dealing with people not on the same technical level as you (i'm speaking about mostly manufacturing environment now). All in all, very happy with this career path. 

Best if luck brother."
Oh wow a fellow UniWar player!
I’d also recommend the wood sage and sea salt body Creme for longevity. I know this is purely a fragrance sub but if you can get a sample of it from a counter and use sparingly under the fragrance I find it lasts a lot longer and is really complementary used under other fragrances.
