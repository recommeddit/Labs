41072,best instrument to play,"Easiest instrument to play at a basic, competent level? 


Bass. By a considerable amount. You only need to mirror the root of a chord and you're doing your job

(I'm a bass player btw. It does get more complicated as it goes. But bass will give you that instant gratification of being able to play one note per bar and be ""doing your job"")"

66747,best soccer team in the world,"I'd probably have fancied South America with Messi most years but Cristiano so good in big games and one weak spot on the South American teams would have made it like 3-1 for the EU in World Cups he was around for.

Africa intriguing on the break, maybe squeaks a semi-final one year at home and loses in the final."
36987,best roller coaster at six flags,"X2, Viper, and Revolution are my personal favorites. Goliath and Tatsu are up there too. I think Tatsu is a tiny bit overhyped but maybe I just needed another ride or two on it. Riddler's Revenge was another surprising highlight. Really wasn't impressed by Twisted Colossus; obviously it's still fun but it's one of my least favorite RMCs."
63413,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"Yea, CSources2 was created way back, went through several changes in order for the user not to be charged again when it was a paid package. Doing so made the app a lil not user-friendly in order to maintain the ios versions compatibility. There is a how to page on the Info page, press the i next to the count of repos. else [https://csources2.wordpress.com](https://csources2.wordpress.com) . In essence, the main page is the real tweak, all the rest are like tweak additions to the app in the app."
66604,best soccer team in the world,"Depends what you want, if you want to watch your team steamroller all opponents then one of the two main Spanish teams (barca and real). But that's no fun, knowing your team is going to obliterate anything before it (sure there are a few slip ups) is pretty boring in my opinion. The fun is in the tension, the highs when you win as the underdog, the fight to avoid relegation to a lower division. I'd recommend one of the mid level English teams, Everton, Tottenham, Southampton, Swansea. There's a good level of banter amongst the fans, there's more passion"
9652,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Both Anacapa and Santa Cruz have been renovated. The biggest differences, I would say, is the distance from the beach. Santa Cruz is close to Campus Point by a few yards and that's really the only difference. 

And don't really worry about ""social"" dorms and whatnot. There's literally nothing you can really do about that. One dorm might be more social than another because of the people who are in it, not because it's that dorm. One dorm may seem more social because more social people may happen to live in that dorm that year. 

And don't worry about San Nic. True, a lot of people have formed friend groups, but a lot of people have not! A lot of people move in/out of San Nic after FSSP, so don't worry about trying to join a hostile environment."
49577,best gaming monitor,"oleds burn rather quickly if used on games. None of their solutions really work for static UI.

If you have the money to burn, go ahead tho. I'm sure they're the best you can get."
46992,best hand santizer brand,"Quick Google of FDA sterilants suggests the main sterilants are:

- Peracetic acid

- Glutaraldehyde

- Hypochlorite

- Hydrogen peroxide

- Ortho-Phthaldehyde

These would be liquid sterilant/high level disinfectants that you can apply with gloves. 

For the real killer stuff used to sterilise equipment e.g. vaccine/medicines manufacturing, they use gases which can get into every nook and cranny. 

The main one is steam sterilisation at elevated pressures, and for temperature sensitive applications, they use ethylene oxide (EtO), vapourised hydrogen peroxide, and EtO/CFC mixes. Naturally these are somewhat hazardous to human health, so the conditions for sterilisation have to be VERY tightly controlled - a level as low as 75ppm of hydrogen peroxide is ""immediately dangerous to life or human health"" for example, and that is one of the least toxic gaseous sterilants."

34079,best NFL player,I don't recall ever saying he was bad or that those were a fluke(although one of his MVPs probably should have gone solely to Barry).

30556,best Mexican war to study,"Re the Revolution: Once I got to University level classes they made it pretty clear that the colonies were looking for any excuse to rebel and that Parliment handed them everything they could ask for over the remarkably sage-like objections of Pitt the Elder. Honestly when you remove patriotism from your perspective both sides appear to have acted like children.
 
The Anglo-American War of 1812 is generally over shadowed in Britain by the Napoleonic War or 1812 and for good reason, it was a fairly undecisive war fought over a point which had been resolved months before war was declared and ended more or less in a continuation of the Status Quo. It gets emphasized in American education as a ""coming of age for the Nation"" as the simple fact that the US didn't get it's ass kicked was a vicotry in and of itself.
 
The American Civil War: This one is tricky. If you take the Union position all of the Confederate casus belli look like thinly vieled justifications for the maintainence of slavery while the other side claims they were defending States Rights or their way of life... like all civil wars it's messy and divisive.
 
Spanish-American War: You pretty much hit the nail on the head. Unjustified but pretty typical of the era.
 
World War I: If taken as a whole I would argue that the war as a whole was unjustified and unnecissary no matter which side you were on. It was a damned shame and could have been avoided. As for the American entry into the war well... it's messy. The sinking of the Lusitania was an atrocity but the ship WAS transporting weapons.
 
World War II: When given the benefit of knowing what Japan was doing in China and what the Nazis were doing to the Jews the war looks pretty damn justified; at the time though it was a little murky. The various and sundry embargos placed on Japan made the Pacific War pretty much unavoidable while I'm of the opinion that Nazi Germany would have torn itself apart eventually (The French resistance would have kicked the Germans out on their own if given enough time; after all French military failures have always been failures of command, not valor) I think the war was the lesser evil of the available options.
 
Korea: I just don't know enough to say one way or the other but from what I do know it appears pretty justified.
 
Vietnam: IMHO this was the least justified war in American history. Ho Chi Mihn's ideals were very Occidental in their bent and had anyone bothered to *listen* to him it would have been made clear Vietnam was *not* the domino America feared it was; hell look no further than what they did to the Khmer Rouge.
 
First Gulf War, Afganistan, Libya and the potential intervention in Syria: I whole heartedly agree."

66036,best college in california,"I’m looking at Long Beach and Fullerton (those are the two closest to me with the best art programs) Los Angeles is a 3rd option. My transfer counselor says that if I strike out (for some reason), Dominguez Hills is pretty desperate for transfers and I can finish up my bachelors there."

36641,best alcoholic drink,YESSS! That's my favorite brand!
922,best desk lamp,"I picked up a nice classic Dazor desk lamp at Goodwill the other day.  It's similar to the [2-tube fluorescent](http://www.dazor.com/2&3_Tube_Fluorescents.html) shown on their page, with the heavy ""desk base"", and the photos there really don't do it justice. It has much longer arm segments than most task lights you'll find on the market, and the base is *heavy*.  (It's full of cast pot metal of some sort, at least 5-10 lbs of it.)

The nice part is that you can easily get various color temperature bulbs for it, and even combine 2 of them if you want an intermediate temperature.  I have daylight bulbs in mine, which some people find very cool, but you could easily get a lower-temp bulb if that's what you prefer.

Whole thing cost me $10 plus another $2 to fix the sketchy plug.  Made in the USA, definitely looks like it'll last forever.  I'd certainly encourage anyone to keep their eyes open for one, and nab it if the opportunity arises."
62479,Best RPG game on PS4,I agree. Monster Hunter World won best RPG last though so I don’t think RPG really means anything anymore to most people.
