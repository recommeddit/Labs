18096,"I have a few stories. I have worked in the special events industry and at most if not all of their houses. 4 years ago I worked the infamous party that happens around a certain holiday
 I worked at on of the houses 2 days before the holidays, took the holiday off and then worked the day after the holiday. The day after the holiday I was in the garage and Kim came in, she asked me how I was doing and how my holiday was, if I had spent it with my family or not. I told her i spent it alone because my roommates were out of town and my family was in another state. Upon hearing that, she said ""I wish i had known, we would have had you over here"".

That was an incredibly kind thing to say, as difficult as it would have been to have a conversation with her the days before and actually have that be the subject, iys still kind that she would have opened her doors to me. 

I have also witnessed her be an extremely kind, compassionate and fierce momma!

8778,"I've had a thought about this recently, myself.  I'd be curious to know if any dentists think baking soda toothpaste is superior for daily cleaning.  Lately I've been using baking soda to clean baked on food from pots and pans, and that stuff works miracles.  Contrary to what you might think, it's superpowers don't come from letting dishes soak in it, or at least, it isn't *only* from letting dishes soak in it.  I'm not sure if that does anything or not.  In my experience, baking soda works because it is surprisingly abrasive.  I imagine it must be sharp but fine like moon dust.  I'm definitely rethinking baking soda toothpaste based on that experience.  I'd love to know if 4 out of if 5 dentists agree.",best toothpaste

Also, I don't see any bowling lineup dangerous enough to neutralize Australian batting.

55999,"> The Mummy(Tom Cruise version) 

That is not a fun adventure movie though, I wish they would've gone for a fun adventure movie instead of a action spectacle movie.

They had 2 ways to go about The Mummy that made sense to me, either a darker more horror focused film, maybe something like Alien or something else.

Or a more family focused adventure type of thing, like the Fraser Mummy-movies.

But, no, they went with spectacle action like Transformers and that segment is so over-saturated at the moment.",best action and adventure movie

If I had to guess I would say it's because they lost games to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand, all of which they had very good records against prior to that.
