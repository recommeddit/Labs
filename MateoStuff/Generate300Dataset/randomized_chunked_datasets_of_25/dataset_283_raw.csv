~$10 (~$18 for a 3-pack) for surprisingly good build quality and decent looks in a big selection of colors. I have a small face so the fact that they have a 52mm option is great. Shout-out to the Wirecutter for recommending them:

SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE ONES IN THE BACK
"Trash talk 

Every time I die"
Knight and day was pretty fun also man from uncle was pretty good action adventure
"Yes, exactly. I like a good cathartic cry though. I would consider it a one woman show/monologue and not a stand up special honestly. But I think by positioning it as stand up, she was able to place it in front of audiences that wouldn't see it typically. She's a very intelligent performer and I'm quite interested to see where she goes from here."
"My husband gets violently ill from amoxicillin and sulfa drugs. Like exorcist style vomiting within 15 minutes of taking it. I'm so fed up with doctors thinking this isnt real and giving him these drugs. He was discharged from the ER once after giving him a drug with amoxicillin in it and I had a fit. The stupid asshole told me ""he hasnt thrown up yet, plus no ones allergic to amoxicillin like that"" - guess who got violently ill in the parking lot!! 

I'm not glad it happens to you, but I'm sort of glad to see someone else has this reaction because my husband was starting to think he's crazy."
It arouses her.  ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
"Let's say you throw 1000 humans into a volcano. One of them happens to land on a ledge inside the volcano and escapes. If he has kids, they will not be volcano resistant."
Nice list. Kudos for Akshay!
"Barack Obama, whose campaign was the real political revolution."
"Cool Water deodorant spray 12 dollars.. hard to beat it. My most fav cheapies has been mostly reformulated or discontinued,but I'll list them anyway, I loved Pumas's Flowing. Jil Sander Sun Men, Diesel Plus Plus Masculine, a bunch of other's that I got for 30-ish per bottle but I won't list them."
"I would say it's a no brainer to go for the more powerful card and ignore noise, etc, but I also say that you should avoid blower models and get the Gigabyte 5700XT on the cheap end or Nitro+ on the high end. This is all coming from the perspective of keeping the card for a few years though. If you're gonna replace it in a year or two then get whichever is cheaper."
"I'd recommend not getting a room in Manzanita...it's super spread out and not very social. I had the same feelings about FT, but after visiting my friends there I had major FOMO."
"Youâ€™re in for a rude awakening, friend"
Better Off Ted was a criminally underrated ABC comedy...more laughs per minute than just about any show I could name.
"But the tsa leaves a card telling you they went through your bag, and I don't think I've ever once flown without them doing it."
"Independiente, Boca Juniors, SÃ£o Paulo, Santos and PeÃ±arol for me. What do you think?"
"Emacs, although the question is sort of like asking ""what is the best hammer to put a nail through my palm?"""
It's a simple question Norm.
Casetify!

"That's why I capitalized Thing. Since 2010 we've kind of expected at least one superhero movie every year and we take them fairly seriously. They're a big deal. Before Spider-Man, superhero movies were really just silly Batman movies and we judged them as such. Raimi's Spider-Man was the beginning of a Thing in the sense that everyone could take it seriously.

Does that sound about right?"
oh damn now thats wholesome! ðŸ¥‡
