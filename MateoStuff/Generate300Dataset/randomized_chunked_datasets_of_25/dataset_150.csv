30011,"I started with the Personal Budget template in the Numbers app (free!). Put your monthly income in the Money In section, list your monthly expenses in the Money Out section (recurring stuff like utilities, rent/mortgage, cell phone, etc.). 

I use the app Strides to track spending on everything else (free as long as you only have a few trackers). I have a tracker for Groceries + Gas, a tracker for Entertainment (which is basically just takeout expenses right now), and a Funds tracker to track spending on whatever money I have left over. 

Downside: It requires manual logging. Upside: It can tell you average spending for each tracker, which you can take back to the Money Out section of the Numbers sheet and then you have a full budget!",best money managing app

24035,Recently watched it and idk if this will help convince you but my opinion on it is that it's a very solid all around anime. It's not exactly amazing in any area but watching it I never felt like they did anything bad or poor. It was a 7 or 8 in my book but it was very very solid all around. I recommend it highly.,best anime
22945,"I’ve posted this in a similar thread a while back:


Andre 3000. This was over 15 years ago. When I was in high school, I worked a local family owned plant nursery. Andre, his wife, and their (then baby) boy used to come in and shop almost every weekend. He was a super nice guy. One time, he bought an entire pallet of sod. He had a brand new Lincoln Blackwood pickup truck, and the pallet wouldn't fit in the bed with the forklift, so I had to load it by hand. He went in, bought a pair of gloves, came back out and helped me load it. Also told me that he was going to go home and lay it out by himself. Kind of shocking considering how much that guy is probably worth. Something that didn't strike me at the time, that I now realize as an adult, was how good of a father he was. His son was just a baby, but man did he love that baby. Every time he would walk up to put a piece of sod in the bed of his truck, he would peek in the window and make a face at his son sitting in the back seat. The kid would cackle like a banshee. After we finished, he gave me a $100 tip, which, to a 15 year old in the early 2000s, was a ton of money. Truly a stand up guy and a very talented artist.",best celebrity
