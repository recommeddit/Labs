Are you bound by an oath of secrecy or something?
Like I said. I'm not a librarian. Do your own research and don't be lazy. Nord is used by a lot of people whop know nothing and don;t care because they do massive advertising. They are very dangerous for torrenters. I know it to be true. Believe what YOU want. I don't really care.

Which field is predominant w.r.t jobs present ?
How lost do you want to get? Critical Role has enough content to last non-bingers years at this point.
"I am a student a csuf and I took a class over at Dominguez hills. And while that particular professor over there was fantastic, I just wanna say that overall its not as nice as csuf or csulb. The buildings are old and the campus is really small, plus the surrounding area is more industrial. Csuf and csulb have a nicer feel to them with LB being close to the beach. 

I don't know anything about their art program, so it might be great. Good luck on whatever choice you make!"
I think that's good advice thanks.
I just use the xbox 360 webcam that they used to sell. It actually had a great resolution and it was plug'n'play.
"Sunday Times.

Or just wait and see the exact same stories on the BBC 3 days later."
"The current version, I was unaware it had been reformulated for the new regs - the version I have is reminiscent of Dent de Lait in that almond and heliotrope are most prominent - no honey I can detect, sad to say."
They didn't have Walter Jones on the first list? WTF. He has a good argument for 2nd best LT ever.
"Just a note--this is a great piece of software, but it goes on sale all the time, both on steam and in humble bundles. Unless you want it right now, it may be better to to wait."
"I am in communication with a lot of home developers in Arizona and have seen nearly every model home in the East Valley.

I have seen a lot of materials used as wall coverings rather than paint. From wood plank flooring, to metal sheets, to textured fabrics.

I'm not sure how much this translates to real world usage. But, for the most part, what I have seen has been done really well. Though, some that I see have a look that instantly gives me a ""that's going to look dated really quickly."""
You could always go to Nashville! We have both NFL and NHL teams and a lovely downtown area.
"I am almost positive the displays you referencing are actually 1440p 144hz, not 4k 144hz. I believe 4k 144hz are coming out sometime later this year, but expect to pay a premium for it (well over $1000 I'd assume, even as much as $2000).

The actual monitor will be able to support 4k at 144hz. The limiting factors will be your graphics card. Currently, even the most powerful graphics cards (like your 1080ti) can't run games at 4k 144hz adequately."
"I think it will at some point.

It already works on Mac OS X."
My #2 choice is the Makati Peninsula!
"I use Excel. 

It works fine lol"
"Now linguistics is just fun. Learning it all can be a bit trippy as you spend the first few classes copying your lecturer to make individual phonemes (imagine a whole class of people going oooooo and then being corrected for it not being oooo-y enough). It's also incredibly interesting - or it was for me!

However, it does depend on what part of linguistics you're going to focus on. The phonetics? The socio-linguisitcs (why languages change etc)? I did linguistics coupled with a French degree but my sister did pure linguistics and we both turned out to end up learning a broad range of different things.

I have little idea for how the job market looks for linguistics, but if you're really into it, I'd recommend staying in academia for a while and really specialising in it.

Start learning your IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) now as that shit is vital and you'll use it all the time in literally everything you do. Forgetting what the symbol is for A in cat as opposed to A in car is where you come unstuck. Unless you're from Boston I guess."

"Honestly, you really might want to hold out.  There's plenty you can do with animals in the meantime, without making a commitment.

Smaller dogs (apt sized) are really not the best kid dogs.  (I'm not saying all, just in general!)  If a dog is what you ideally want, wait until you find that house and work with a reputable rescue to find a breed/dog that fits your family best.

Rodents aren't really ""toddler pettable"".  Sounds like your child wants something he can cuddle and pet and hold on to.  

Why not get him involved with outside places that involve animals?  Reading with dogs at libraries/rescues.  Find a cat rescue where he can pet them and help take care of them.  

Now would be a great time to teach him that different animals have different needs and qualities and it's best to find a pet that fits everybody.  

My son (age 6) has been begging for an orange and white kitten since he could talk.  He's obsessed with them!  To the point he would tell people we had one and then he started pretending to be one- he has a name and everything.  It became a huge problem, I'd actually have to have the ""we don't lick people"" talk every day.  His teacher gave me the ""here's a crazy mom"" look when I attempted to explain it to her but she quickly learned, lol.  I don't know where this comes from, we've never had any cats!  

But... We can't get a cat.  We have a dog (my husband's PTSD dog) who'd most likely rip it apart.  I explain it the best I can (and how trading our dog for the kitten won't work, and no, the dog can't live outside) and help him understand that our house isn't a good home right now."
That's how you prevent later groups from getting the free beer.
Is that the one with bits of real panther in it?
Then I would just have a bunch of cans of the wrong color paint.
