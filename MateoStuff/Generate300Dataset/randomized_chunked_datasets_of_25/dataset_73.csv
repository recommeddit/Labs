26243,best politician,"Reddit has made it suck to say this, but Theodore Roosevelt. I always then have to add the qualifier that I am a Roosevelt Scholar, wrote my undergraduate thesis about him, collect first editions of his books, etc. He's such a well known President, but very few people really understand how astute, well-reasoned, and effective he was as a politician."
58183,best cologne,"Luna Rossa Carbon by Prada. It’s right around $100 a bottle. I usually keep 5 to 6 different colognes around and it depends on who I’m with or where I’m going for which one to wear. YSL is also a good light scented cologne. 

Also, while we’re talking cologne I’ll take a moment to plug this advice; 

Cologne is meant to be discovered, not announced."
47442,best state to visit in the United States,"They are except if you're from California. They hate California almost as much as they hate Trump. 

Also they're far from nice in Denver. They're absolute assholes in Denver."
6961,best iPhone,"I kinda liked the 5C since my first iPhone was the 3G and it kinda made me feel nostalgic. Other than that, it was a pretty bad miss. 

For me the worst iPhone was the iPhone 7. It didn’t had the headphone jack, no real upgrades compared to the 6S and they did the planned obsolescence thing on that device. 

The best iPhone IMO is the iPhone XS, since it checked all boxes for me:

-	Smaller design
-	Modern look (Face ID, notchless)
-	OLED display
-	Affordable during 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max release
-	Decent battery life
-	Second (and more improved) generation X device"

68765,best science fiction novel,"> further sedimented that fact in my mind

I'm going to start using this phrase. Unlike something being cemented almost instantly in ones mind, sedimented is a gradual accumulation of confidence in a given opinion."
23040,best celebrity,"Worked at a pretty big nightclub in Hollywood for a while, we would get celebrities in our place and would see them around. 

Miley Cyrus--had the premier for the Hannah Montana movie, her and her entourage took over the back room. As expected a bunch of little kids waiting to see her and wanting autographs at the cordon. Associate/aide/whatever comes up and asks if we can clear the kids away because they are bothering Ms. Cyrus. She didn't say this herself, but she was looking over and didn't do or say anything to counteract it. 

Mandy Moore--nicest person, all smiles and giggles. I almost professed my undying love for her, but her man at the time was with her. Wasn't phased in the least by having to wait for an extra 15 minutes outside for her car to gather her. 

Masi Oka--brought an underage girl in and when stopped at the door for her not having ID (we had vice on our asses all the time so we were supposed to be ""strict"" about ages) he complained that since everyone knew him it should be ok. Managers eventually let him him. 

Marilyn Manson--came for a big Halloween celebration, spent the whole time in a closed off VIP area and drank all the free stuff. Ended up not performing and just bounced out. 

Sean Combs--came for a event by someone else, ended up taking the stage and doing an impromptu set for over an hour. No fanfare before hand, he just asked for a mic. 

Queen Latifa--one of the most beautiful women I have ever met, not only looks wise but in graciousness. Very approachable and pleasant to talk to. 

Terry Crews--love this guy. Ran a BET event, VIP was upstairs. No one without a wristband goes up. Of course everyone says they are someone or with someone, and me being a simple white guy telling them no, it starts getting ugly. Terry Crews comes out of the crowd, parts the sea like fucking Moses, and stands there with me for a few minutes telling people to back the hell off and listen. Pats me on the shoulder and goes upstairs. Best guy and not a shred of primadonna about him. Great guy! If you see this Mr. Crews, you made a lifelong fan that night. 

I have more if there's interest. I guess the takeaway is that celebs are people like you and I, they just have more people telling them how great they are and how much they are wanted around. And like most people, that can easily go to their heads. Human nature and all that."
