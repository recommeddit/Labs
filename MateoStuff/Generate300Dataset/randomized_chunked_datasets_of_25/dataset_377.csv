I've been eyeing the [Asus Zenbook 14](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Ultra-Slim-i5-1035G1-Thunderbolt-UX425JA-EB51/dp/B08KH9SX3G/ref=pd_ybh_a_4?_encoding=UTF8&refRID=P51TKX0M0BJB1TFRQ1YG&th=1) for nearly two months now (wish i pulled the trigger during the black friday deals). The i7-10 has been out of stock for awhile now on amazon, best buy, and asus website. I do notice that newegg appears to have it in stock (i find it odd they do but the other dont). My question, is there a major difference between the i7-10 and i7-11 - in terms of daily use and for long-term use. Do you think the i7-10 will come back in stock or is it just worth getting the i7-11?",best laptop for general use

68232,"It's a very difficult choice, but here's my list:

* Peter F. Hamilton's *Pandora's Star* and *Judas Unchained*. Formally space opera, these novels have everything a sci-fi fan can desire.

* *Hyperion* and *The Fall of Hyperion*, by Dan Simmons. The same as the previous (However, I not enjoyed the irregular *Ilium* Saga by this author).

* *Evolution*, by Stephen Baxter

* *River of Gods*, by Ian McDonald (Actually almost any novel by this author, for example the two published *Moon* novels).

* *Stars my Destination* or *The Demolished Man*, by Alfred Bester.

Special mentions: *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K LeGuin and *The Golden Age* by John C. Wright
