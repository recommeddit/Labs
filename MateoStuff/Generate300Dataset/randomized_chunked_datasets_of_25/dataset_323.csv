70102,"Regarding graphic design... this was my major and my conclusion is that you really need to be **really** talented to expect to go far with a graphic design degree, and when I served as TA for any class, I realized that maybe 20% tops of any given class of designers were ever any good. Those who do succeed though can find a lot of demand for their talents. And of course as always, likelihood of finding a job is highly dependent on where you're located/looking for work.

Edit: To add to this, if you factor job satisfaction into the mix... arguably I'd say graphic designers (and other creatives who get to actually do creative things for a career) are some of the most passionate about their job and their work. My colleagues and I would likely agree that we all absolutely love what we do for a living and it's our hobby. So even if we were able to earn a substantial salary increase for working a more administrative or managerial job, we'd probably still rather stick to being designers.",best major to study in college

5824,"Ermm. First, I'm not suggesting to start with a production project. When you have a task, you can actually find what knowledge you lack and you will stop asking vague questions ""What tools web-developers need"" when web-developing is pretty huge area and there are a lot of different webdevelopers. Second, knowing all nuances in CSS will not help to write server-side logic. While full-stack developers are pretty valuable, a lot of people still doing either frontend or backend. Third, learning Javascript can be unnecessary with modern tools (e.g. Coffeescript or any non-javascript fullstack framework: it usually generates javascript). There are a LOT of tasks where you don't need to learn JS.

Also there are a lot of pure frontend tasks but I'm not actually skilled in that so I'm not going to make advices here.",best programming language for web development
