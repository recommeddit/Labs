What usually happens is companies that use the product pay some people to work on it (or donate to the project).
"I like all of these albums, especially The Queen is Dead, but the greatest album ever? NME to me seems to jump on the alt-rock train into credibility. ""Is This It"" at number three? It's a good album, but can an album that only came out 12 years ago truly be that high on anyone's list? 

Also, I know that NME is a British publication, but their strange affinity for British rock acts gets on my nerves. They hype that stuff up so much it's not even funny, or a novelty anymore.  

Edit: Also not one single 'Mats album? What a joke."
"I think it’s most important to establish the reason you want to wear cologne. You say you don’t have much of a sense of smell, so I would imagine it’s because you want others to like the way you smell. Specifically, it seems you want a smell to attract the opposite sex. In my experience women tend to like blue, and spicy scents. 

I see a lot of people recommending creed on here, but I really can’t stand the smell of any of their scents personally, but I’d definitely consider at least checking them out if you’re willing to drop a lot of money. 

For blue/water scents I’d recommend these for each category:

Budget: *Cool Water for Men by Davidoff Coolwater*

Classic blue scent, wears lightly on the skin, and is super inoffensive even to people who dislike colognes. Light lavender notes and some mint but really heavy on the water.

Average: *Issey Miyake L’eau D’Issey Pour Homme*

Still the classic blue scent but with a bit more depth. Nice citrus notes and some spice come through with a fairly woodsy finish.

High End: *Byredo Gypsy Water*

The most complex of any blue scent I’ve come across. Very peppery with nice citrus notes. Loads of juniper with a slightly sweet base of vanilla and sandalwood. 

(I’ll note that I prefer almost any other scent to blue scents but they’re super inoffensive and women in my experience *really* love them) 

For Spicier Scents I’d just go with *Royall Lyme Bermuda’s* stuff

It’s classic spice depending on the style you get. Each one as good as the other.  Loads of warm and fresh spice albeit extremely palatable. It’s inexpensive and it’s what many would call “timeless”. 

My personal favorite cologne of all time, however, is Tom Ford’s Oud Wood. Tons of compliments every time I wear it, but unfortunately expensive and heavy. Great for winter with tons of Oud and pepperiness. I wouldn’t recommend this one to you because you mentioned your sense of smell isn’t that great. It’s super easy to go overboard when applying it and no one wants to be around the guy who’s cologne is going to nauseate them. 

Best of luck buying cologne. I hope this was helpful."
"Considering they had to make new cases for 13 is there a chance they improved it

I ordered one, and I’m guessing apple has a decent return policy, but I’ll prob grab this spigen mag as a backup incase it’s garbage again?"

It’s a pump-action air gun that shoots table salt (costs around $40). They market it for flies but it works especially well for mosquitos. I love blasting those assholes out of the sky!"
I say this every time the color green gets mentioned. my wife hates it.
"This advice is too late for you but maybe it'll help others.

I used to like pointing out patterns to my kids.  Weather patterns, how mud cracks when it dries, solar system, numbers, ...anything.

When my daughter was about 8 I talked to her about puberty and how it's one of the patterns in life.  I went on to explain to her that, along with physical changes, she should expect emotional changes as well.  That most kids go through this pattern and she should recognize now that, as she gets older, she may get mad at us for no apparent reason.  I told her that, that will be okay, that those feelings will pass as she gets older.  That we will love her when this happens.

She looked up at me and said ""Don't worry dad, I promise to remember this and will try not to get too moody.""

It worked.  She's now 18 and has been a wonderful teenager."

"The best thing I've found is pseudoephedrine.  When I was a kid and you weren't charged a fortune to see the doctor my dad would take me to see the family doctor and I would get a shot of something that would clear me up instantly for several hours.  Unfortunately, that isn't an option in today's environment."

"Don't depend on them. Instead, go through some English language grammar courses, and learn to do it the right way. Grammar checkers and Grammarly in particular are not, by any stretch of the imagination, completely accurate. They are a tool to use once you already know what you are doing.  An exceptional knowledge of the English language is the best grammar checker available.  I apologise if this sounds a bit harsh, but I am a copy editor/proofreader by trade, which I trained for. I'm not perfect but no one is.  There are way too many non-native English speakers who try to be English speaking ""proofreaders/copy writers/enter-profession-here"" without a basic understanding of grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. I realize this may or may not be the case with you. If it is, I highly encourage you to take one or two of the MANY FREE English grammar courses available online. I can point you in the right direction if you are interested."

Are you talking about Kenzo Fleur? In the squareish bottle with pink floral designs on it?

Also how underrated our stars are. A couple of these guys listed above *anyone* on our team has me scratching my head but what's new.
"Good for them! Some quick reading tells me most brands don’t use nearly that much, and most bottled water is treated ground water (aka tap water), so in terms of energy usage and potential waste, a bamboo or metal reusable bottle is still much more eco-friendly, IMO"
I got the HP 27xq for 180€ ! I'm very happy with it and it's very cheap in my opinion for a 144hz 1440p :)
Aaaand I'm crying. Thanks for sharing!
"It definitely takes some looking, but you can get lucky (like I did). Last time I was there, which was couple months ago, they had the last model Pegasus for $75 which is a good deal in my opinion. Unfortunately my feet don't like Pegasus very much, lol.

Edit: I have Nike factory store really close, do sometimes I go there just for the fun of it to look what they have."
