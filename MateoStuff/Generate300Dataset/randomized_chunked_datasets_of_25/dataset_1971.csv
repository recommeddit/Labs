47320,"I recommend Chicago, personally. I went last summer and was amazed. While stereotyped as a dangerous city, this is mainly concentrated in several low income areas on the South Side. The core of the city is incredibly beautiful, safe, and very walkable. It will get quite cold if you visit during the NFL season (Chicago's NFL stadium is located downtown, right next to the famous Grant Park) but it sounds like you enjoy that!

For sightseeing, I recommend the John Hancock Building, Sears tower (These first two will give you two great different views of the city from above), Chicago River architectural boat tour (A boat takes you around Chicago via its prominent river and a tour guide explains the historical significance of the surrounding buildings), Navy Pier, the Chicago River Walk (pedestrian path built beside the river), and the L train, among other things.

If you're looking to extend your stay and see other parts of the country, Chicago is also ideal because it is one of the main centers for rail transport in the US. This includes many wonderful overnight trains with sleeping accomodations. Not only can you take the train to another city, but you can see the country's incredible scenery roll past as you get there. I took a train back to my home in LA, but if you don't want to go there as you mentioned you can take trains to Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and more. 

Sorry for the long comment with poor formatting (I'm on mobile), I just wanted to share my experiences. My Chicago/overnight train vacation was by far the best I've ever done!",best state to visit in the United States
