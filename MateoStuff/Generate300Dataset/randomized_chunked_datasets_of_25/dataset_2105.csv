16534,best pet for toddlers,"Just FYI, feeder goldfish get huge (up to 18 inches long), live 30+ years, and two require a minimum of 55 gallons. Please check out r/goldfish for more advice...they're far from the easy starter pets everyone thinks."
63869,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,And ebooks!  it's my favorite!
67578,axios alternatives reddit,So? It works exactly like it did two weeks ago.
70850,best movies with a cool twist,The village
40961,best instrument to play,"That's where you are still mistaken. It is not just the number of instruments that makes percussion difficult. Even specialising in just one instrument is difficult, for instance any of these: snare drum, timpani, marimba, vibraphone, tambourine.

People underestimate how much goes into learning to hit something to produce a good sound."
7878,best laptop for general use,"What's the closest thing to an LG Gram 16 that uses a Ryzen processor?  Good display, taller aspect ratio, good battery life."
51160,best rap album,The list is bullshit. No point complaining in this sub though.
58206,best cologne,LIGHT BLUE IS MY JAM
61869,Best RPG game on PS4,"Well, everything is an RPG these days. It's almost a meaningless term. 

To me, I know what I think of as an RPG. HZD definitely has RPG elements. 

Either way, my point was that the guy above me was inconsistent. Calling Witcher and Bloodborne RPGs is fine, but you can't omit HZD then."
31699,best hotel to live in,"Is Texas still your legal state of residence, or are you having to pay tax in whatever state you're currently in?

(Texas: No state income tax!)"
36051,best alcoholic drink,"[The Truth About Alcohol, Fat Loss and Muscle Growth](http://www.leangains.com/2010/07/truth-about-alcohol-fat-loss-and-muscle.html)"
53873,best medicine for a cold,"I make a stout herbal tea, very hot, with two cloves. Then i put the juice of at least half a lemon in, a huge spoon of honey, and two shots of makers mark, then finish it off with a thin slice of the best butter available. Take a benadryl, then this. Make sure you pee before you pass out. 

It always makes the drinker feel better, but mainly you care less that you feel bad, so it's hitting you from both angles."
65550,best phone service company,I work near the airport and never had issues on my Pixel 4XL on Fi.
44556,best items under $100,Nah i need something that tells me it needs attention.  Feeding my pets multiple times a day? No problem but giving that fucking cactus some water? Nope i forgot that thing for 3 years straight

13020,best gifts for mom,"In June my brother committed suicide and it has my mother absolutely destroyed.. but she has a giant urn on the fireplace in remembrance of him, I found these beautiful colorful stone urns I'll attach a picture in a moment, but that is what I am getting her."
13637,best research paper archive,"Yeah because that’s a practical way to spread knowledge to everybody... the fact that I need to pay to have a subscription to see scientific articles is an obstacle to me and everyone else like me when it comes to being an informed citizen. Then you have to be able to discern what is a good paper and what isn’t, and if you rely on using papers that have been cited the most, then you rely on the majority being right which isn’t always the case. So I guess I have to send an email to the author of every single paper I want to review personally. This is a neat trick but doesn’t solve the bigger issue here which is the fact that knowledge is hidden behind too many barriers for the average person to get through reasonably. We gotta find a better way"
65372,best phone service company,"If you travel, yes. If you will just be in a general area, ask friends or family."

34111,best NFL player,"4 SB wins, ZERO interceptions ZERO! A record that will never be broken, guaranteed!"
3254,best webcamera,"One thing I would say is you may well come across the issue OP was discussing in that subreddit too. I asked around there when building my pc and most people were pushing me to get better parts when I already stated I was spending £1000 MAX.

I have the PC I decided on and stream everything on ultra with no issues at all but the advice I was being given said I'd struggle. People love to spend other people's money."
21510,best winnie the pooh comic,[Kinda ruined the mood for me](http://i.imgur.com/yWSrAhW.png)
60704,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I think it definitely takes a different kind of skill to make clean comedy work. Anyone can make a story about sex or shit or farting or whatever funny, but to tell a joke with none of those elements and still have it be funny is, as you said, definitely hard to pull off. DOn't get me wrong, I love the raunchiest of comedians, and I don't think what they do is easy in the least, but I do have a certain respect for the former, especially because I don't think I could do it."
72897,best Linux distro,I only have least favorites: Ubuntu (flakey) CentOS7 (buggy)
