To me, I know what I think of as an RPG. HZD definitely has RPG elements.

13637,"Yeah because that’s a practical way to spread knowledge to everybody... the fact that I need to pay to have a subscription to see scientific articles is an obstacle to me and everyone else like me when it comes to being an informed citizen. Then you have to be able to discern what is a good paper and what isn’t, and if you rely on using papers that have been cited the most, then you rely on the majority being right which isn’t always the case. So I guess I have to send an email to the author of every single paper I want to review personally. This is a neat trick but doesn’t solve the bigger issue here which is the fact that knowledge is hidden behind too many barriers for the average person to get through reasonably. We gotta find a better way",best research paper archive

Anyone can make a story about sex or shit or farting or whatever funny, but to tell a joke with none of those elements and still have it be funny is, as you said, definitely hard to pull off. DOn't get me wrong, I love the raunchiest of comedians, and I don't think what they do is easy in the least, but I do have a certain respect for the former, especially because I don't think I could do it.",Best comedy show on Netflix
