"Look into Paulownia Tometosa to see if it will grow well in your area. It's an extremely fast growing tree and is the traditional tree used to make Japanese Tonsu's (chests). Also getas, wooden sandals. It's almost impossible to buy but amateur woodworkers need it if they want to make a traditional tonsu.

The wood is very light in weight, somewhere between balsa wood and cedar. The light weight also makes them one of the top woods for building world-class surfboards. The wood is also being used to make very nice electric guitars because the light weight makes them easy to play for long periods when standing.

In Japan there used to be a tradition that when your daughter was born you planted a Paulownia tree (called Kiri in Japan). When she got married you would cut the tree down to make a tonsu.

The boxes that little Japanese trinkets come in are usually made from Kiri wood. In olden days valuable items on Japanese ships would be kept in Kiri wood boxes because the wood doesn't shrink or swell with changes in moisture (once dried) and would protect the valuables from water damage.

All in all a very useful wood that is almost impossible to buy here in the US. Be aware that in some states its considered a weed/nuisance tree."
I just use my duffle bags and a non tsa padlock.
Its even a harder mindfuck than Inception
You know what? I love vanilla. That shit is delicious and all these orange mocha Frappuccino assholes with their fancy ice cream flavors can go fuck themselves.
"#1 : Your favorite game

#2 : Your second favorite game

#3 : Your third favorite game

Keep going until you have no more money.

How do you find out what your favorite game is? Play other people's games. There's tons of us with tons of games that will play with you. So figure out what you like, buy boardgames that are that or like that. Because I don't think there is going to be a list of 10 games that works for everyone. Reading thru some of these other lists there are definite bias towards what that person liked. What matters is what you like."
Fiverr is an easy way to hire someone for what this commenter said
We have mostly large animal vets where we live (farming community) so that's a good thing to factor in.
Until the Chinese.
"The US doesn't really have all-inclusive resorts.  You find them in the Caribbean and Mexico.

Drop ""all-inclusive"" and just look for a kid-friendly resort.

Also, many places farther up the coast like Virginia or North Carolina won't have beach weather in March, so southern parts of Florida or California or Texas would probably be your best bet, depending on which of those you are closer to."
Great choices. Mmm I love Tolu.
"Live in Oklahoma and find it hard to believe Hot Tamales are the most popular. Them + Red Hots and Mars bars (Snickers Almond?) are like the only candies I dislike out of the bunch (don't like hot stuff, don't like almonds)."
"Facebook has invested a tremendous amount of time trying to make PHP more viable for the kind of scale they're dealing with so there's a real question in my mind as to whether it was the best choice.

Just because you *can* do very large software projects in PHP does not mean it is the best choice or even a good one."
I thought Shutter Island had a good twist.
"Basically, unless you want an Android for whatever reason, buy an iPhone. Plus unlike the XR, the 11 has 4GB of RAM like the more expensive models."

He was right (only when it comes to cricket though). Cant believe I am saying this.

But the US was very selective in who it traded with.

"Thanks, u/stetsdogg! Very helpful.

I'll look into Red Pocket's $5, and if eSIM is an option, then sending a message or a call is super easy!

RE: Google Voice, that's what I'm trying to solve. I dropped Verizon when I moved out of the US full-time, but now that I've upgraded my iPhone, I'm locked out of Google Voice because I need to re-verify the number (web still works)."
Is it any good for light gaming ?
