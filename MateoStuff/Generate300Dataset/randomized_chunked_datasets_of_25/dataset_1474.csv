56671,best desktop monitor,"The timing of this post could not have been more perfect. Debating upgrading from my 1440p QNIX IPS monitor cause the active adapter i bought is causing occasional on/off. In hindsight I should have just saved up the 350 dollars I ended up spending to get a 27"" 1440p 144hz gysnc IPS monitor haha... Oh well. 


It's between the asus and the acer ones right now I would love to pick up the viewsonic one but yeah 1-2k no thanks.

Since amazon is trying to kill everyone with their monthly payment thing I'll probably go with getting it from them. Currently looking at either:

Acer Predator XB271HU bmiprz 27"" WQHD (2560x1440) NVIDIA G-SYNC IPS Monitor, (Display Port & HDMI Port, 144Hz) 



ASUS ROG SWIFT PG279Q 27"" 2560x1440 IPS 165Hz 4ms G-SYNC Eye Care Gaming Monitor with DP and HDMI ports

The Asus one is more expensive by 100 dollars. But I don't know if that's really worth it. I'm thinking that this resolution and refresh rate is going to last me for a very long time and especially once the mid range cards can actually push this resolution with every cranked to the max at 144hz it'd be nice to have gsync in the meantime. I would have picked up the Dell TN panel one that bestbuy had a days ago but I just can't go back to playing my rpgs like witcher 3 on a TN panel. If anyone can put the final nail in the coffin that would be great as I haven't paid much attention to CES but last I checked the upcoming monitors or adapative sync TV's and such since I both pc and console game are just too damn expensive hah."
6887,best iPhone,"I think that just applies to your use case. I frequently use “Hey Siri” at bed while plugged to set the alarm for the next morning or to check the weather when I don’t really want to move a single muscle anymore. And I have done it since “Hey Siri” was a thing, even before owning the 6S. Maybe that’s just me, idk.

I was just pointing the fact out, though."
3601,best college for research,I think that's likely the consequence of an R1 rather than the diagnostic tool for one. I might be wrong though.

47344,best state to visit in the United States,"FWIW, I lived in San Antonio for 3 years, am from the midwest and currently live in the midwest. I’ve never heard anybody, other than a Dallas native, suggest Dallas as a good place to visit. Austin is the way to go if you go to Texas."
1044,best ice cream flavor,"In high school, I worked at a certain ice cream shop with dozens of flavors. I gave myself literal cavities gaining this experience, eating quarts of that stuff for years*

*during the summer.

Mint chocolate chip is the best flavor. It's science."
36063,best alcoholic drink,"If you are concerned about the calories and fat gain, or are trying for fat loss, [here](http://www.leangains.com/2010/07/truth-about-alcohol-fat-loss-and-muscle.html) is a good workaround.  The whole science behind alcohol metabolism is explained, but for the method, just scroll down to ""How to lose fat or prevent fat gain when drinking.""  This is a nice cheat for nights you want to go heavy, or want to lose some water weight you may have been retaining."
14715,best romantic novel,"Gone With the Wind is a good epic. Also, Women in Love by D.H.Lawrence."

3573,best college for research,"think of something specific you want to find first, then search ""\[thing\] \[college\]."" for example, i applied mostly as a chemistry major, so i googled ""chemistry undergraduate program \[college\]"" or something similar for each school. if i wanted to find interesting professors, i'd navigate first to the department i was interested in, then scroll through the faculty list. 

\^this kind of research i mainly used for ""why \[college\]"" essays. you'll want to name-drop a specific program or unique major they have and potentially a professor in your field (and why you're interested in their research/how that connects to your story). round out the essay with  fluffy talk about the school's atmosphere and the type of students it attracts. to get an understanding of a college's environment, student vlogs are super helpful. you can also try to analyze the way colleges market and advertise themselves to get an idea of how you want to make yourself come across. does their website feel more refined or welcoming? eccentric or straight laced? once you get a good feel for the type of person they want, you can shape your essays to better reflect that mold while still bringing your unique self to the table.

anyway, sorry this became essay advice lol. in general, it helps more to search for a specific thing on google with the title of the college rather than spend hours wading through confusing, non-user-friendly websites. good luck!"
55984,best action and adventure movie,Lost City of Z?
68421,best science fiction novel,"Reading downhill is how I'd describe the second half of Cloud Atlas. The way the ending of each section cascades into the next is absolutely beautiful.

Cloud Atlas is one of my all time favourites. I've read all of Mitchell's books. I'm assuming you've read Ghostwritten and The Bone Clocks. They're all tied together but those are the most similar. 

Also doesn't Cloud Atlas make you want to hear Frobisher's piece of music so badly? I hope one day some talented person will write it and it will be perfect."

38331,best newspapers to read,"I'm slowly working towards a better balance. I'm moving soon and setting things up to where I can leave and basically go off grid for 2 or 3 weeks at a time to just revitalize myself. No computer or TV or other people. I'm probably 6 months from getting everything in order, which is fine since winter won't be a good time to learn."

5814,best programming language for web development,"Learn SQL/PHP, along with JavaScript of course. If you become very fluent with PHP, that's great. Otherwise, I use PHP for basic backend functions (dynamic pages + link to API), but Python and/or any other language for the core back end (for example, I have a Reddit bot written in Python, but it uses sockets to get/send data from the REST API)."
