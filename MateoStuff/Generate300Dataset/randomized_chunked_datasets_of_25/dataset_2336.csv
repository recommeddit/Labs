47929,best color to paint with,"The other thing that got on my last nerve was the trimming. I can usually trim with brush only. The Sherwin stuff was impossible to do with the type of brush I normally use to trim with when using Behr. I had to severely downscale in size and use a small artist’s brush to get the clean lines (because the paint was thick, like honey and just wouldn’t flow), which took much longer/more work. Oh, and four coats of the trim paint. But, now that it’s all done and the room put together, it looks nice. The color is very nice in our ‘29 bungalow bedroom with zen touches."
22236,best celebrity,"Not me, sorry BUT my best friend's co-worker was on a plane when Samuel L. Jackson got on the plane. Everyone started freaking out over it and were trying to talk to him. But this guy decided he was going to play it cool and give the guy his space. The plane took off and they went where ever. As this guy was getting off the plane he was going to be passing by Mr. Jackson as he was grabbing his bag from the overhead compartment. My friend's coworker knew that he couldn't just walk by so he had to say something but his mind was blank. As he's walking by him he just blurts out, ""You are the fucking shit."" The guy just continues walking and he gets nervous because Mr. Jackson doesn't even look at him. He continues walking and is almost off the plane when Mr. Jackson yells out, ""Hey! No... You are the fucking shit."" I can't even imagine how good this guy now feels about himself."

54034,best medicine for a cold,"Normally I take a Mucinex and then an hour or 2 later take a really hot shower (there has to be a lot of steam) and put your face by the stream of water and breathe in the steam. Then blow your nose while in the shower. Every time I get congested I do this and it clears me up pretty good.

5135,best home improvement store,"HD (3 miles): I like Rigid corded tools and Ryobi cordless, and the garden center is setup a more to my tastes. 
Menards (6 miles): The farthest away, but it has the largest selection of wood in stock and is usually cheapest. However it’s main area is organized by Alzheimer’s inflicted hoarder so it can be hard to find shit. Also usually the cheapest. 
Lowes (2 miles): Closest to me and they also have a veterans discount which generally brings prices in line with Menards prices. 

In the end it will depend on what the project is and if I happen to have any Menards rebates on hand. Since Lowe’s is close, for oh shit trips in the middle of a project I go there almost exclusively."
