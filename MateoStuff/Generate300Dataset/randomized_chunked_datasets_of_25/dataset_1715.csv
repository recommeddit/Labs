This 1,000 times. It is so easy to double up on types of medication when you're trying to knock out a cold that makes it hard for you to focus mentally. Lose track of time, think that one just isn't working and you try another one ... it all adds up.",best medicine for a cold

18803,"If you ever get a chance and find yourself in Seattle, I HIIIIIGHLY recommend going to the Imax at the Pacific Science Centre and watch the Hubble 3d show. They render the images taken by the Hubble to generate a real-D image that gives you absolutely *stunning* visuals of the galaxy, gas clouds, birth of stars, and more. It's one of the coolest things I've seen. Very touching to see space like that. I find comfort in our tiny existence. Realising it only makes it that much more incredible that we're alive in a time where we not only have the technology and intelligence to look into space and ask questions, but a time in which we can still look up in space and see stars. Billions of years from now, our brothers and sisters throughout the universe will only see a dark sky, forever incapable of exploring space like we will.

55542,"I really didn't care for this series. Kind of self-important, *very*meandering, and while it dabbles with some incredibly cool ideas, it ultimately just kind of screws around and does nothing.  I gave the series up in the second book after West killed someone very unexpectedly (y'all should be able to guess, accurately, which character), and I found myself giving zero damns.

Seriously, when a character makes a completely transformative move after two books of development and you don't care, that's a clear sign that there's something significantly amiss with the books.",best action and adventure novel series
