24111,best anime,Thanks! It sounds pretty unique.
4952,best home improvement store,"[Knowing that Home Depot supports the reelection of Donald Trump, I don't spend a dime there.](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740173176/home-depot-responds-to-calls-for-boycott-over-co-founders-support-for-trump)"

15934,best sunglasses for fashion,I've had like 3 or 4 pairs of cheap ass wayfarer knock offs and every one of them has fallen apart or broken in some way. Bought pair of Ray-Bans like 6 years ago and they're still going strong.
15633,best sunglasses for fashion,Blazers
69194,best major to study in college,"Can confirm. My FIL was an engineer, got his MBA paid for by a company at a mid level state school. Was the CEO of a small cap public company for ~3 years and just transitioned to a private company as their CEO to bring them public."
53633,best medicine for a cold,">One of these is found in a ton of combination cold medicines, but a lot of people already have these at home, so make sure you‚Äôre not unintentionally doubling up.

This 1,000 times. It is so easy to double up on types of medication when you're trying to knock out a cold that makes it hard for you to focus mentally. Lose track of time, think that one just isn't working and you try another one ... it all adds up."
29634,best game console,"God damn does it ever.  It's stupid that the developers didn't put it on PC because not only is it a great game, it would have virtually NO competition as a skating game."
18803,best YouTube video,"If you ever get a chance and find yourself in Seattle, I HIIIIIGHLY recommend going to the Imax at the Pacific Science Centre and watch the Hubble 3d show. They render the images taken by the Hubble to generate a real-D image that gives you absolutely *stunning* visuals of the galaxy, gas clouds, birth of stars, and more. It's one of the coolest things I've seen. Very touching to see space like that. I find comfort in our tiny existence. Realising it only makes it that much more incredible that we're alive in a time where we not only have the technology and intelligence to look into space and ask questions, but a time in which we can still look up in space and see stars. Billions of years from now, our brothers and sisters throughout the universe will only see a dark sky, forever incapable of exploring space like we will.


We are so fucking lucky."
65944,best college in california,"This is perfect, especially UCD and UCI haha"
52053,best iphone case,Just the regular case. I don‚Äôt really have a need for wireless charging. The battery on this phone is pretty good üëç
10846,best suitcase lock,"Zip ties can be released with a small screw driver. 

You can definitely take them off without compromising them."
1264,best ice cream flavor,"Ben and Jerry's ""half baked"". It's chocolate-vanilla with cookie dough and brownie... hard to scoop with a spoon but so worth it."
14711,best romantic novel,"Well, yes, anything by Georgette Heyer. Discovering Heyer is kind of like finding out that Austen wrote fifty more books that no one told you about."
39582,best podcast for biologists,Science Talk from Scientific American is another great one.

47095,best state to visit in the United States,the sand dunes are amazing :D
49590,best gaming monitor,.... but still get merked by some dude with a bubble monitor.
55542,best action and adventure novel series,"I really didn't care for this series. Kind of self-important, *very*meandering, and while it dabbles with some incredibly cool ideas, it ultimately just kind of screws around and does nothing.  I gave the series up in the second book after West killed someone very unexpectedly (y'all should be able to guess, accurately, which character), and I found myself giving zero damns.

Seriously, when a character makes a completely transformative move after two books of development and you don't care, that's a clear sign that there's something significantly amiss with the books."
7729,best laptop for general use,"Hi, you'll need to be a bit more specific. What is your budget? What are you using your laptop for? Does battery life or weight matter?"
21766,best winnie the pooh comic,Ok. This is this the forst thing on this subreddit that has actually made me feel uncomfortable. Jesus this is not the pooh bear I remember....
64800,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"It's the same comment in a lot of threads that take the form of ""where should I do blah"" or ""where should I eat"". And it gets upvotes, so there are accounts that are upvoting. Not sure why."
