2899,"I’m confused. Not by high impedance and low
Impedance…. But that you just disagreed with this original comment, then restated what he said but slightly different. 

He said if you don’t have an amp to power the high impedance don’t get the high impedance headphones. 

Only difference is you mentioned a DAC, which offers no power difference. A DACs job is literally what DAC stands for: digital audio converter. It converts digital audio to analog audio. An amplifier on the other hand amplifies your source to properly power headphones which is when impedance matters. 

If I plug my 300ohm HD800S’s into my DAC alone they will be insanely quiet because they aren’t getting any power increase from my amplifier…. Now if I plug my DAC into my pc to convert the digital to analog, then plug my amp into my DAC, and my headphones into my amp, my headphones now can get so loud that some find the sound level too much. 

Idk if I’m explaining this incorrectly or if you don’t know the difference between an amp and a DAC but either way the original comment is correct in my opinion… if you don’t have or don’t plan on buying an amp, then don’t get high impedance phones.

BTW: my friend has dt990P and a 50 dollar tube amp from Amazon powers his headphones surprising well and sounds great for the tiny cost.",best headphones
