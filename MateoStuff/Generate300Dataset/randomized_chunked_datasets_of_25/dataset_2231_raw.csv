"A 1-second long blackout hit my house right as she counted down to ""3"" and my computer turned off. I was a *little* freaked out, to say the least (however, there's a storm going on here so it wasn't *that* scary)."
"I know right, and don’t get me started on them leaving out <insert player here>!"
Python and Django as a server-side technology. Javascript / jQuery as a front-end.
"Art Hotel in Barcelona. I was the hostess on a 2 day city trip some pharma sales people had won. I was so stressed I didn't fully enjoy it (these were high profile people of a very important client, I also adored them they were really good people and I wanted things to be perfect for them) but: the pool was amazing, the breakfast buffet was delicious, the bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. They have candies and chocolates all over the place for free.

One day, I will go back."
Berkeley should be the kid that stops talking to you after you disagree with them on a political issue
It did it with the software for me.  Software is only thing you can use to edit the cams settings.
Google calendar.
I tend to agree. It is pretty rough to new players and has no way to catch up if you have a poor start.
Try to figure out the most important conference and journals and check their programs/recent issues.
"Sad to see the Black Ocean: Mobius series by J. S. Morin isn't anywhere on these lists! (not that I've seen yet anyways). Awesome firefly-esk feel, with wizards, and an amazingly deep universe. There's 2 spinoff series (Mercy for hire; Astral prime) based off the original that really delve into the universe and its characters. Highly recommend it to anyone"
"This is a rather new trend, Croatia made semis at the world cup in 98, Serbia & Montenegro had a strong team in 2006 & 2010, with players like Vidic, Kezman, Ivnovic, Kolarov, Stankovic & Krasic (who fell off a cliff after a great year at Juve)."
"Merced has really boosted their medical school collabs (Davis/SF) in the last few years and is now a premiere preceptor location, esp for family med/internal med. Might be what’s making Merced so hot?"
"Running a 5600x with a 3060ti and it's not even close to bottlenecking it, I really don't think any of the CPUs you consider here will bottleneck a 3070."

Upvote upon upvote for the Wallflowers series. So good.
Thanks for the awful reminder!!!!
nigga u stupid
Happy New Year to you too! I'm happy to help.
"Thanks for the info, i’ll check these out."
"Yeah I definitely agree with you that Scream is a fantastic ride. Very nice elements and a lot of action. But it has seen better times and the dozen punches to the head are a unforgivable deal breaker for me. Same goes for Riddler. Batman however was tolerable, I have to admit that. I very much appreciate that modern coasters tend to get away from over head restraints and try to give the rider a free experience around his head.


Thrill is in fact something we see seldomly in Europe. But as I said, I'd now say that I prefer themeing over thrill."
"The Toronto.

2 ounces rye whiskey, 1/4 ounce fernet (Branca typically preferred), 1/4 ounce simple syrup, dash of bitters.

I usually toss a little extra fernet in because I love how it cuts the rye. I can't get enough of this."
"This is the kind of list I could have put together. Excellent choices and so nice to see Ijon Tichy on there - us *mucilids* should stick together!  Incidentally I recently read G K Chesterton's book ""The Man Who was Thursday"" and discovered it had the same theme (and surprise) as the 11th Voyage from the Star Diaries.

One day I intend to test my theory that every single book by Clifford D Simak has a dog in it."
