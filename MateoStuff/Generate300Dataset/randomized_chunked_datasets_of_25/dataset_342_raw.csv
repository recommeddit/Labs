D&G light blue or powder blue. Something like that. Idk my wife bought it for me.
I havn't washed my hands or gotten sick in 10 years.

"I’ve used python for data analysis and found it a little outdated, but maybe there are newer versions. For the basics libraries like pandas and numpy I preferred to just do a project and learn as I go. Maybe start with some tutorials."
Nice
"There's no way to block everything and stay undetected, but uBO's team and community are very responsive about handling of problems.

If you do run into anti-adblocks, etc., just make a post here* and it'll get fixed asap. No need to whitelist websites long term.

\* Actually, first purge and update filter list caches, then search the sub, then make a report here or on github."
I know. I just want to what the best settings are
Superrica is where you find all of the dipshits from LA lined up feeling smug because they think they know an insider secret.
Yes!  One of my 3 staples!
"If youre going to Colorado, you should rent a car and drive down the state through the passes. Start in Denver...drive to Leadville through Independence pass down to Aspen and so forth through the Rockies until you reach Durango... Hitchhiking in Colorado is also insanely easy...The cities are cool, but going to Colorado just to visit Denver would be a waste"
"it said $100 not $100k

Whoa that's Taco
Worst is circus peanuts. Those orange puffy things that taste like stale crap.
"Pipe organ? Nah. Surely one keyboard is easier than multiple, and having no keyboard to play with your feet (without seeing well or at all) is easier than having one."
One of my favorite shows.
"What *do* you like? Or why ?

Can’t really think to suggest anything. And how can you not like breaking bad, I really like to know why."
"As a flute, alto saxophone, and oboe player, I say that it personally depends on me for the moment. My skills on each vary depending on how much I have to play each at a certain point of time, but sometimes I prefer a certain instrument over another. Each has its merit."
Emphasis on cheap!
"Ha I've done this multiple years in a row.  But why do dad's always buy plants?  

At what age do I suddenly have an urge to farm?"
"A Chromebook. My dad is a babyboomer who has had a decent life, but never got into technology. I bought him a Chromebook three years ago and he uses it daily to assist in the tasks he does. His browser favorites are all farming, cattle, and trading sites like Craigslist, but he is making great use out of it.  This year I plan to introduce the concept of smartphones."
Never water down good whiskey!
"Whoa that's pretty cool. I still actually use my car's cassette deck, and don't want to upgrade to an aux cord one."
"Happy birthday! I turned 21 in april and didn’t drink alcohol until then. I’ve tried a lot of drinks these last few months lol. Wine and sangria get me fucked up like nothing else does. Vodka + cranberry juice or vodka +lemonade is a classic drink my friends and I get a lot. If you’re gonna do shots I like tequila more than vodka. 
Margaritas are amazing. 
Long Island iced teas are also great for getting fucked up and are super sweet. People might judge you for drinking them but who cares. Lol"
"Agreed. Then you have three genuine fast bowlers, as well as Sobers and Kallis. This is a bit of overkill so you can drop Akram for Muralitharan."
