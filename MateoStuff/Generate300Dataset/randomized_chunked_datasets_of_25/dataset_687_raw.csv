Can you use cheats in San Andreas? I have vice city and it’s not as fun without cheats
"Oh, I see, it appears that Instart Logic's console-detecting code works only for Chromium-based browsers.  Thanks for the head's up."
"Clement Attlee. 

Post world war 2 beat Churchill for the office of PM and, amongst other things, founded the NAtional Health Service, which has provided nationalised healthcare to the uk ever since. 

No other organisation have ever come as close to the hearts of the British people as the NHS, nor has any organisation changed as many lives."

"Yup, exactly. Not a smoker, I stopped drinking red wine, and my teeth got browner! It finally resolved when I stopped using that mouthwash. Lovely that the company heralds that as a sign the product is working!  No thank you."
"You can’t upgrade to the $55 unlimited plan, it has to be a new account. You can port out, open a new account and port back. And yes you can use the refills."

Kendall - idk much about her

Kylie - I have an irrational dislike for her"

"Arnold.  Met him at ""The Arnold"" in 1996 and at a bodybuilding gym in 2000.  No cameras and he was still super motivating.  He told everyone how its obvious how hard they work and how great they look.  He signed pictures for kids and smoked cigars like a chimney.  Great guy.  100% real man."

"I don't know, it could be 1.5."
I have my gaming rig and an Xbox Series S that replaced my ps4 when it recently died. I play everything on PC for the most part. The Xbox has game pass and is for sports games and older 360 games like Army of Two.
"Had liberal arts degree, could only find non-career admin-type work and it totally sucked. Went back for compsci degree, now software dev. Still sucks a decent amount but the money helps"
"I don’t really agree. I’ve seen Gideon mentioned a few times, but one of the subs most popular authors is Becky Chambers and she has her books recommended all the time. 

Yeah, it’s a bit more heavily weighted towards straight white dudes but I think that’s more a reflection on the fact they they have historically put out much more work."
"I do love John Scalzi, but I'm not sure what work this refers to?"
