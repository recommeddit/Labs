13869,"The best three papers we learned about in school were the Framingham studies, the study finding estrogen replacement therapy increases risk for breast cancer, and the study linking folate to the prevention of neural tube defects. The first is one where an entire town has participated in the study generation by generation for decades, and has given really useful data that has shaped how America sees ""health"". The second one is remarkable because unforeseen side effects became so prominent so quickly during the study that they had to cancel it early because continuing it would increase risk of morbidity/mortality unacceptable in the researchers' behalf. The third used and absolutely INGENIOUS method of retrospectively questioning mothers about PNV use and confounding for their guilt in losing their babies.

No body scanner, no removing your shoes and belt, and you can leave your electronics in your carry on. Plus, the line is usually a lot shorter since not many people seem to take advantage of this program.

I highly recommend it to anyone in the US who flies at least once a year.",best items under $100
