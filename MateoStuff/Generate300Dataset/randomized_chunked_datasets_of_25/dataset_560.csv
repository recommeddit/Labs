7436,"Hi, it is very hard to predicate what the market is going to look like in a few months, so it is hard to give a good suggestion right now. I would wait and see what deals are available later. The Legion 5 Pro is definitely a good choice if you can find it in stock. The battery life isn't great, but the build quality is reasonable for the price point in my opinion.",best laptop for general use

53830,"My Dad's got a great miracle brew for colds. Boil chicken stock, water, lots of garlic, and more chili than you really can handle.   Pour it down quickly when it's cooled down a bit. I usually drink 2-4 mugs a day, then sleep for 12 hours. The chili helps opening up your throat and nose, as well as forcing your body to sweat out the toxins during the night.  I always wake up well rested and in good health the next day.",best medicine for a cold

67245,"No they are not errors in the request. The server is giving a valid response. I as a dev determine if that is an error.

I’ll explain the 404 example a bit better. You could design your REST api in a way that it returns a 404 if a resource is not found. This should not be handled by throwing an error in your app. The dev should write the logic to deal with this.

So every response the server gives is a valid response. Depending on the response code of that response we can determine what to do with it.

An actual error with the request, coming from the network or fetch itself, that should throw an error by default. Not valid responses.

If you want all non-200 responses to automatically throw an error you can make a simple wrapper yourself for that behaviour. It should however not be default in my opinion, and that is why I prefer fetch.",axios alternatives reddit

46799,"This is amusing to me.  After the swine flu 'outbreak' last spring, my university ordered and delivered Purell hand sanitizer stations to the entrances of each building on campus.

In Microbiology this semester, we tested various antiseptics and disinfectants to test their antimicrobial ability.  In addition to these, we tested an 'unknown', which we later found to be the Purell hand sanitizer.  In short, Scope is the best antiseptic, 409 and anything containing 'alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride' as an active ingredient are the best disinfectants.  Also worth noting, the Purell was the worst antimicrobial agent tested.",best hand santizer brand
