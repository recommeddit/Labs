50817,best rap album,"I've been so obsessed w that album (and their last one before that)

The transitions are so great, the hooks are catchy as hell.

Bossa Nova Corps -> Kno U is crazy (no pun intended)

I also love the ""motherfucking gami gang"" at the start of ""Isopropyl Alchemy"" and the *Jimmy Newtron* sample I forget which song. It's a really good synthesis of pop punk sensibilities and math rock/metal intricate guitar work."

48086,best color to paint with,I paint my rooms with RGB.
69919,best major to study in college,"Sociolinguistics is not so much why language changes as it is how language impacts society and how society impacts language.

Job wise, there are some linguistics jobs with the government, some with search engines (Google keeps a few), some forensic linguistics jobs (decoding a recording that will be used as evidence in a criminal case), and a few codebreaking things. Not a whole lot, but there are options not in academia."

761,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,Whens Daiquiri ice making a comeback?
73806,best matte screen protector for ipad,I heard a lot of great things and terrible things about paperlike. There is so much controversy over this brand I am just super confused at this point haha

15174,best tree for the garden,Saint Paul has a lot of old clay pipes for sure.
36147,best alcoholic drink,"I call it a Russian Lemonade.

Vodka. Ice. Lemons. Like a whole lemon cut up, but not squeezed. Let it slowly sink in. No sugar. Nothing else.

Mid-range Vodka works fine, don't use anything worse than Smirnoff. Make it very cold."

52096,best iphone case,The reviews read really great but a case with a cutout for the Apple logo is the mark of the douche (IMHO). I loved the Spigen Neo Hybrid until the bumper broke after 3 months and Spigen support told me to pound sand.
