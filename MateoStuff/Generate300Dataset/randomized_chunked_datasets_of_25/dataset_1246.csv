15485,best tree for the garden,"Another good one would be eastern burning bush (also called eastern wahoo), which can easily be grown as a tree as well.

22572,best celebrity,Awesome. RIP.
65058,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,I'm sure you've both been to SLO. What do you think about Kreuzberg and Scout?
30501,best Mexican war to study,"I would recommend Mexico and the Spanish Conquest by Ross Hassig. Not a huge read, but extremely comprehensive."
54810,best water filter,Now you have.
59168,best perfume,I always say something when I smell someone wearing Drakkar Noir.
51966,best iphone case,How‚Äôs the protection? Will it survive an accidental drop from waist height?
69321,best major to study in college,"yes, accounting, and I would have sat and passed the CPA exam asap after graduation"
50783,best rap album,"Did Sonder even drop a project? doesnt show up on their spotify.

Mad respect for the mustafa big up. You're the only person here that mentioned it and it's easily the best project this year for me. Also shoutouts Savon."
59079,best perfume,I second the scentbird subscription- I chose some awesome perfumes and some weird ones as well. I love choosing something that not many people wear. They carry some French brands that I have never seen in stores.
22780,best celebrity,"I waited on John Malkovich a couple of years ago. Fairly low key and unassuming, he seemed just as strange as you would expect him to be. We had butcher paper and crayons on the tables at this place (kind of an art themed joint) and he drew picture of a little house. Still have the drawing to this day."
7529,best laptop for general use,"Hi, me again from your last post that I commented on lmao. I‚Äôm currently looking to upgrade from a laptop with the following specs: https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GT73EVR-7RE-Titan/Specification

To something at or around 2-2.2k. I don‚Äôt mind only go up to a 2070/2080 or other sub 3080 graphics card since I know a lot of the higher-end cards are difficult to come by rn.

What would you suggest? (Last time we spoke, you said I should wait for the Lenovo Legion 5 to be back in stock, but it still hasn‚Äôt, or to go for a MECH-15 from eluktronics, but that‚Äôs a smaller screen than the one I have now.)

(Sorry if this double-posted in the May post. Reddit is being weird.)"
28463,best breakfast foods,"Strawberry banana smoothie with chia seeds. It's a lot more filling than it probably sounds, and you're getting your serving of fruit earlier in the day along with some calcium."
28617,best breakfast foods,"The lesser the timeline is on most anything, the better it is. 

Lighter roasts have more caffeine, less bitter. Though, good strong black coffee is delicious. mmmm

Fresh roasted will taste better, freshly ground will taste so much better, and if you microwave leftover coffee or use the same coffee in the same filter twice you're gonna have a bad time. 

Folgers is the devil in a red package. No me gusta."
5109,best home improvement store,"I‚Äôve had good experiences at Ace and True Value, but they‚Äôre both pretty far from my house."
43191,best detective show,"I‚Äôm obsessed with Dark, probably one of favourite shows of all time! Thanks for the suggestions"
23160,best social networking site for CS,Github and LinkedIn completely suffice. Don't skip LinkedIn.
13834,best research paper archive,"Well, [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1311997/pdf/jaba00061-0143a.pdf) might be even more concise, but for reasons I cannot quite fathom, it never won the author a Nobel Prize. Might have been a contender for an IgNobel Prize, though, if it hadn't been published too early.

There's also a follow-up [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2078566/pdf/jaba-40-04-773.pdf); both have been on reddit before."
4612,best text editor,"I recently started using Atom and I'm really liking it so far. Project tree structure, multiple panes, git interface. Its also cross platform so I can use it in linux and windows. I mostly used Kate and Gedit in the past."
19919,best workout music,"Baroque music always does the trick! Try some Bach, Zelenka, Scarletti next time."
59048,best perfume,"Oh no!!! You should try armani code, it's got more of a... peppery scent to it. Rather than floating along like j'adore it has this beautiful bite to it that I love."
12785,best gifts for mom,"Everyone on reddit simultaneously: ""SHIT, when is Mother's Day this year???"""
37422,best amusement park,"Still there, still Mountain Creek but that's a tamed version of Action Park.. You can still see where the concrete tracks came down the mountain. üëç"
9730,best dorm hall at UCSB,"One more thing! They have ""special"" floors so you should look to see if any of those interest you. They aren't especially different than any other floor but the RA may try to put on a few more events towards that ""theme.""
You can see all your options on this link and what dorm they are in:

46590,best trick or treating candy,"Right? This obviously didn't control for outliers. There's got to be one particular neighborhood of elderly people, who are all convinced of the spiritual significance of Red Hots upon the youths, and so we get branded with this nonsense."
