geez imagine just having a non political description of your distro instead.....
"When it comes to webcams/cameras, people tend to forget that you'll more than likely NEVER fullscreen the camera. So yeah, once you've scaled down the camera in your stream, the total resolution it can output is not as important. Getting something that'll output like, 5XXp and maybe 60fps (like a PSEye camera) is pretty good for a stream. What IS super important is good, balanced, and intense lighting. If you give a camera enough lighting, the picture will be great. If you give one of those cheap logitech webcams very little light, it will look like shit.

However when it comes to stuff like audio and general PC build for single PC streaming setups, I do think a lot more consideration and investment planning should be done. If you go the USB mic route, you are really limiting yourself to that mic. Your only upgrade path is another USB mic. Where as if you took the time to save up a little more, you could get a really decent USB audio interface which would allow you to open up your horizon to hundreds of XLR mics. 

Single PC streaming setups have become much better in potential output quality due to the better NVENC encoding options on the newer Nvidia cards. Dual PC setups will still net a better looking stream (and truthfully makes your stream less of a pain with everything stream related getting offloaded to another PC) but you can now achieve pretty great results with single PC setups."
+1 to this. Every. single. time. I wear this perfume I get complimented! Without fail!
"> You could get fiio btr3 adapter to make any pair of headphones wireless, but nothing wireless will contest a wired pair tbf.

Would this be a good option for gaming or is the delay worse than having a RF wireless headset/headphones"
Righttt. Like fuck  I mean God is often called the father but he didn't fuck my mom.
"Cassettes use magnetic tape to record audio signals to magnetic flux changes recorded on strips. The Aux to cassette bypasses the tape strip and just produces the magnetic field. If you look inside them, they are made to spin since the car still spins them like a normal cassette but there actually isn't a tape in there at all."

Everlane everlane everlane.
"As is : (  He was only 19 when he died, and my in laws (his parents) thought it would be nice to let his best friend and girlfriend pick the music for the opening and closing of the service.  So this is what they picked to play while everyone was arriving and getting seated.  SUPER awkward, but they were teenagers just trying to choose something that they knew he enjoyed, so...no one could really do much but cringe a bit and move on."
There's no point to try the skoll if you felt the Model D was too big for your hands. XM1 is worth to try once for almost anyone who is a gamer.
"Toshl is really nice. It has a slick and simple interface. You can input everything manually if you preffer that. They are also implementing support for more and more banks. It also reminds you to input your daily expenses so you don't loose track.

"An Elgato facecam came out recently that looks really nice. The software allows you to change exposure and other settings like a normal camera, which is great. There are a bunch of videos out there that talked about it when it released."
"Ever tried nnn? It's also partially inspired by ranger, but is written in C (lf is written in Go). It's also [way faster](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Performance) than ranger. So fast, in fact, that it can list a directory [2 times faster than `ls`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Performance#nnn-vs-ls)."
So the “We are Two Different People Tour” was a lie?!

Got talked into trying a Gin & Tonic with a sprinkle of pepper and a piece of cucumber in it.  Absolutely delicious.
"Yeah, that's the estimate delivery date, but I've been waiting for a month for mine to ship. Other people have been waiting too."
Did a search for cryptic and upvoted. It's the reason I buy then Indepenent.
In my mind the topic of which team would win in a head to head match up is one of the best convos in Cricket. Wish i got the chance to watch the Windies live to see for myself.
Mike birbiglia!
Yeah exactly! Very difficult to choose!
