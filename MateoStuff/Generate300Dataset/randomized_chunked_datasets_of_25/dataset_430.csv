53474,best usb c charging cable,"Make sure you're using it with a USB-PD charger, like the one supplied with the Pixel 2/3. A random charger that supports Qualcomm's  Quick Charge might charge your friends Samsung S9 fast, but not charge your Pixel 2 at anything other than slow."
17559,best iOS game,No problem. Just wanted OP to know the downvotes aren’t a reason not to try Hexonia.

5081,best home improvement store,"Honestly, HD lost my appliance business when they wouldn't let me pick up a microwave, because its an appliance, so it must be delivered.  I might have let that one go, but the $399 microwave was on sale for 10% off, which put the price below $396, which is their cutoff for free delivery, so they were going to chance a $59 delivery fee.  So they wanted me to pay $455, plus tax, for a $399 microwave, that was on sale.

I went to Best Buy and picked up the exact same model microwave two days later, for $369 + tax."
37312,best amusement park,"Well the Dakotas don't really have any amusement parks. I didn't count the waterpark rumored to get a raptor.

Silverwood isn't really a surprise either. The closest amusement park to Montana residents is Silverwood. Washington was more of a surprise. Wild Waves theme park is supposed to represent the Seattle area, but outside of that area an overwhelming number of online Google searches prefer silverwood, so overall more searches in Washington lean towards Silverwood."

640,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"The two most important things a torrenting VPN should provide are excellent security and good connection speeds. Features like a kill switch and split tunnelling are especially useful here, too. Here is my recommending list of [best VPNs for torrenting](https://recoversoft.wordpress.com/2021/07/01/best-vpn-for-torrenting/). If the VPN goes down while you are torrenting, without a kill switch, your torrenting will no longer be private."

619,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"PureVPN user here, i actually look to get away from it because i feel like there's better options out there.

p2p speeds are terrible, one rare day 7mb/s download, but most others at best 1-2mb/s within barbados or the netherlands with configuration set in favor for speed rather than security.

it's been an ok 4 years but certainly not the best!"
