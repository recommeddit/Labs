5081,"Honestly, HD lost my appliance business when they wouldn't let me pick up a microwave, because its an appliance, so it must be delivered.  I might have let that one go, but the $399 microwave was on sale for 10% off, which put the price below $396, which is their cutoff for free delivery, so they were going to chance a $59 delivery fee.  So they wanted me to pay $455, plus tax, for a $399 microwave, that was on sale.

I went to Best Buy and picked up the exact same model microwave two days later, for $369 + tax.",best home improvement store

p2p speeds are terrible, one rare day 7mb/s download, but most others at best 1-2mb/s within barbados or the netherlands with configuration set in favor for speed rather than security.
