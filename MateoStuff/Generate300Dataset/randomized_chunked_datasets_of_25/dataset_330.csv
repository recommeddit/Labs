16840,"This! 

I have had cats, dogs, rats, 3 species of hamster, gerbils and mice. Rats are my second favorite after cats, maybe tied with dogs, but my husband is allergic to both cats and dogs, so here we are. 

Rats are literally like little dogs or cats in terms of intelligence, personality and bonding (must get 2 because they are very social-- if you want a little less smell/pee, make it sisters, not brothers). You DO have to clean their cage about every 2 weeks, but otherwise, extremely low-maintenance and cheap. 

Only sad thing is you have about 2-3 years max with them. 

Our little ones are 1.5 years old and bring our family so much joy.

ETA, for non-OP readers: For the OP, rats could be a great option, because her kid is 8. I wouldn't recommend them for any child under 5, and that's a 5-year-old who is very responsible and gentle. Maybe 6-7 for an average kid, because rats weigh about a half-pound each and although somewhat resilient (land on their feet like cats), are still a lot more ""fragile"" than a cat or dog, simply due to their size.",best pet for toddlers

-Oregon Coast: Gorgeous cliffs overlooking the ocean, backed up by temperate rain forests.
