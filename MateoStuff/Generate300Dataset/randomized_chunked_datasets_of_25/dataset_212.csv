26542,best board games,This is a great introductory list but I would maybe buy a couple of these first and then see if you'd want to move onto more advanced games (aside from Terraforming Mars which is pretty advanced). I found that soon after getting into games I wasn't really excited about playing my introductory games anymore. But some games have more rest value than others.

30631,best Mexican war to study,"Why would he go to a third party country for a trial for something that happened in the United States (and to the United States, in the case of the embassy bombings)? Why would that be acceptable to the United States? That was pretty clearly a non-starter and a stall for time by the Taliban, regardless of whether you ultimately supported the war in Afghanistan or not -- or for that matter felt that Osama bin Laden bore some responsibility for the September 11th attacks."
