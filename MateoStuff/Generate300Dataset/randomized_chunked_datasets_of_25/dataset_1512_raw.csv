Hey that’s my home park! I remember the time before Fury and Intimidator putting us on the map. It’s awesome to see it grow up so much and making it a household name in the theme park world.

"That is fine for making music in your bedroom with a computer.

Not everyone has a voice that everyone wants to hear! It's more practical to play an instrument that you can play with other people - you can sing at the same time."

I see why don't you just use the standard charger cable that came with the phone? USB 2.0 speed is more than enough unless you are like transferring 4k movie files or something.
"Having completed a multivariable calculus class already, I'd say the ti-84 is all you need. I haven't taken linear algebra, though."
"I think that the thing with many liberal arts degrees is that you should only pursue that if you're really serious about it. If you have a true passion and an unusual aptitude, and you want to get a PhD, work in academia, and devote your life to Women's Studies or Chinese literature, by all means pursue it. But if this is not your plan, you might have a hard time with a BA in Women's Studies. For the hypothetical Women's Studies major, a more practical alternative could be, for example, to take Women's Studies as a minor or even a double major with Psychology or Social Work, and use your understanding of women's issues to do something like work with domestic abuse victims or rape victims. It's a practical, actionable career plan, beyond just finding the subject interesting, but having no clue how you're going to apply it careerwise."
"If a country magazine made a list of absolutely nothing but country, then no one would care. But this is titled simply ""the greatest albums of all time"" and features only a token effort to acknowledge that anything other than rock music exists."

"More an action RPG but I JUST got into the Yakuza series and I'm pretty addicted. Finished 0, now I'm halfway or more through the remake for 1 (Yakuza Kiwami) and it's the only thing I'm playing till I finish 6. 

Gonna take some time and I'm cool with it!"
Man I loved the Daily Texan. I was also a huge fan of the Texas Travesty. It was always cracking me up in class.
"I got a BS in biotechnology, which would have been alright if I followed it up with a MS or PhD. If I could go back, I would definitely have majored in either nursing or clinical lab science because those two fields have a ton of job openings. They don't earn as much as some others might, but it's great to have the confidence of knowing you could live anywhere and still find a job quickly. For maximum earning potential with just a bachelors, I think computer science or IT is the way to go."
