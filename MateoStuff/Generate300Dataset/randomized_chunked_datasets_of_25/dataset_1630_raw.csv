I've been 2-5x a day fapper for years and have always bragged about how healthy I am. I never made that connection!
I would prefer 1 toothbrush instead of 1 toothpaste dude
"There are still little particles of charcoal in it that can cause abrasion. It's possible that the particles in your toothpaste are so fine that the abrasion is minimal, but I would still avoid charcoal toothpastes."

"> Being a studio engineer doesn't make you any more qualified to judge what the best produced rap album is

A studio engineer who is interested in Hip Hop is. It's like saying being a film director doesn't make you any more qualified to judge what the best directed film is. If you're qualified in that sector, of course you are more qualified to judge it, at least more than the average listener. 

Being somehow involved, professionally,  in production/mixing/mastering will definitely make you more qualified. Especially when most of what makes production good IS the correct use of audio engineering. You can be as creative and ""out there"" as you want, but if you can't adjust the mix to reflect the emotion of instruments used and make everything peak correctly then the production WILL sound shit."
"Oh yes that’s true, you’re lucky to have a dentist husband. He will give you great advice on how to take care of your teeth."
I like chrome because it only shows the bookmark bar in a new tab. If I could change Firefox so the bookmark bar only shows on new tab and not on websites then I would use Firefox.
"Yep, now that I'm (voluntarily) unemployed , I'm thinking about it. Though I am more on (re-)learning Drupal (8) & PHP (7) and improving on (COBOL-like*) programming language I've used for some time now.

"Put the eggs in icy water and wait -yes, have to wait - for them to cool down for you to peel the shells. (don't let them pass this point, though. Yes, I did it)."
"The Farthest. It is about the Voyager missions. Must see for science and problem solving fans.

"Distilled water tastes terrible, actually. I expected it to taste like ""nothing"" before I tried it, but I was surprised and it was legit bad."
">	I think we’re all a lot more alike than different and we all want to see more BEV and less ICE. Cheers.

Exactly. So when someon can only talk shit about one car brand but claims to be about all in it together it comes across as hypocritical."
"If you win the IPS glow lottery, maybe the LG 27GN950-B for SDR.
 
Hard to beat it: 
27"" 4k 144hz (160hz w/ update) IPS (1440p upscales on it just fine) 

But it's only HDMI 2.0, but how many console games actually push 4k/120hz? You can run some of the others at 1080p/120. 

For HDR, your best bet is to just go for the 48"" LG CX OLED - this one would be everything you could ask for were it not for the size."
As is tradition
Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this!

Revolver & Noemi are both two great new places.
My mom's getting where she appreciates experiences over things.  Last year I got her concert tickets to a music group that we both enjoyed and found an authentic German restaurant to eat at before the concert.  She loved it.
Still sounds like brand new production.
