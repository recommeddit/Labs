"This. Last release was 4 months ago and really, what updates does something like this need? There are no critical security issues I'm aware of and it works fine."
"hey, i just clicked this and watched the whole thing and thanks. I want to make that mini foundry.  I was recently thinking about making a few cool fixtures for the back yard, like a forge, a teepee, and a shed.  this is a point in the right direction."

"I don't know about all of their competition, but I also don't want to spend the time looking at car values so I'll assume that's true. I think now that competition is coming, the depreciation will be higher."
"I did read it; the American war against Mexico was war over spoils and conquest of territories.  That’s way of 18th century post colonial North America; has nothing to do with a nation bullying the other.  

You should also read Winfield Scott’s and Zachary Taylor’s bios ...."

"Plus, Steve Waugh would also be the captain (if Border isn't there) and he was pretty decent with the ball as well."
I still have my Jansport backpack from 2002. No tears or rips. Still going strong. Used as a high school bag and college and now just around the city or airport carry on. Great bag!
"I've really been enjoying the Books of the Raksura series by Martha Wells lately. It's a high fantasy in a world completely unpopulated by humans, which is pretty hard to find anymore. The main characters spend a lot of time traveling around, encountering new races, seeing weird ecological systems, fighting strange enemies, and dealing with complicated tribal politics. I'd highly recommend it if you want a series filled with adventure and unusual settings."
"As a travel agent I'd like to disagree. They do have most things included however its a differently style of all inclusive, its very european. Theres no 24 hour food/drinks, very limited options in terms of things to do, entertainment is very limited, no transportation in the actual resort. I'd steer clear if you wanted something truely all inclusive."

"Out of curiosity, what didn’t you like about it?"
*I'm thinking of ending things*
"Pacific NW is great. Seattle and Portland are awesome in the summer. Beautiful nature, great restaurants and just straight up cool. 
    
San Francisco and New York, hands down are the coolest cities. 

BBQ is good in all over the south, it's really just a difference in style. If you wanna go to Memphis that's cool, but Texas (Austin comes to mind), Missouri and the south eastern states have great BBQ as well. 

Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio is probably the best amusement park, but there are decent parks in Texas and California as well. I think some of the Six Flags are reasonable."
"I know what you mean. I only know this stuff, because I have been going to the area about 1-2x per year for the past 20 years.

I think what it boils down to are a couple questions:

Do you want to party or looking for a quiet place to relax?

Are you traveling as a couple or are you traveling with friends?

Also, in the end, you really do get what you pay for with the resorts in the area. All of the ones I listed are pretty similar as far as quality is concerned. It is the vibe that is different. You won't have a bad time regardless of your pick, so don't stress out too much. If you like the vibe at STV, go for it. Keep in mind that one of the pools is for preferred club rooms only, and there is no swim up bar."

"For me, my perfect Father's Day gift would be like a normal day with my family, but without the responsibility part.  So, I wake up in the morning and have coffee with my wife.  When the kids start getting antsy, I  get to leave and go to the bookstore by myself for two hours.  Then I come home and show my wife the books that I bought and she thinks that I made really good choices.  Then the kids show me the lego things they built for me, and I get to admire them.  Then my wife puts the kids down for a nap, while I skim reddit for a few minutes.  Then we get to watch Orphan Black on our computer for a few hours while the kids sleep.  Then when they are up, we all go to the park, and I get to talk more with my wife while we watch the kids play.  Then we all go to In-N-Out where I get to have a double-double w/ onions and animal fries and a chocolate milkshake, and I don't even feel bad about it.  Then we go home, and the kids give me a home-made card that says, ""We love you, Daddy!,"" and my wife gives me a card that says, ""World's sexiest Husband.""  Then I am feeling really good about myself, and after the kids go to bed, I bury my face in my wife's ample bush."

I think the Benq EX2780Q is worth a look.
Thank you for putting together this list! Very helpful.
"Yeah, as a top 10 to own, just go with one or the other. I own both, but I have way more than 10 games and really own forbidden island in order to play with my niece and nephews."
