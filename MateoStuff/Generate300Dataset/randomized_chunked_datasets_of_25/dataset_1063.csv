61114,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I second this. It also has the benefit of being adult themed, yet mainly clean. So something enjoyable that you can watch with kiddos around."
17778,best Kardashian,"You're exactly right-- that Kim gets misconstrued in a negative, bimbo light while Kourtney gets misconstrued in a positive, down-to-earth light. 

It's possible that SNL (and Kourt herself) perceive her as the ""smart"" one because she's a college graduate, but a degree has zero measure of intelligence, especially emotional intelligence, where she lacks the most. 

I love Kourtney, but sometimes her unbelievably petty, self-centered, holier-than-thou attitude is bewildering and honestly shocking and really hard to digest. It's shocking that she could be in the limelight for this long and still not develop an ounce of humility."

42250,movies like Inception,"No, this is as crippling a movie as humanly imaginable"
60723,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I agree with that too. I was just saying New In Town is produced by Comedy Central rather than Netflix. Comeback Kid and Kid Gorgeous were both Netflix produced.

I was not 100% sure if New in Town had been removed from Netflix."

54135,best medicine for a cold,"So true story - peppermint is a natural anti inflammatory and anti-mucous!!! Mug of hot water + just a couple of drops of peppermint extract (can be found with the spices and vanilla at the grocery store) = awesome vaporizer! Just breathe in the steam and enjoy! You can keep refreshing it in the microwave, and do in conjunction with other medicines if necessary."
25794,best cricket teams of all time,"He, in fact, banned it in Germany after a Test between Germany and a touring England side ended in a draw. He believed that it was a waste of time to spend five days playing a game only to get no winner at the end."

65176,best phone service company,"Kind of a regional thing.  When I was in the midwest, US Cellular was great.  Now that I am back working and traveling not just in the US but worldwide, I use Verizon.  Way better for international calling.  Used ATT before too but did not like their international coverage.  T-Mobile had good international coverage but would drop calls often."

There are very few spots in the film where he's not kicking someones ass. And all those spots are Bridget Fonda sucking at acting.

Watch it for Jet Li."

52766,best hiphop album,DOOM is hard one to choose from... Most of his work under any moniker is an 8-10. He may have one of the best body's of work.
36146,best alcoholic drink,Ah yes I did indeed mean delicious refreshing coca cola
66028,best college in california,"Prop 13 was a voter led ballot initiative with huge support at the time. 

Iâ€™m sure somehow you can blame Reagan but as of now we have supermajority of Democrats in the state senate and state assembly who I wish would do anything within their power to loosen the effects of it."
65646,best phone service company,"True!  I am hoping Spectrum does it to try to catch up though.  Spectrum just launched mobile last year, similar prepaid pricing, and I just moved out of Comcast's area and into Spectrum's."
