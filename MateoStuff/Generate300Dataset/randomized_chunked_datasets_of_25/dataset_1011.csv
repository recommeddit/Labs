Pointlessly expensive?  check.  However, if you're supporting clustered RAC/Oracle environments, it forces Oracle to deal with their messy broken crap rather than try to pawn it off on ""your OS vendor.""",best Linux distro

69859,"I've had my degree for seven years. One of the biggest benefits is that mechanical engineering can be used in every industry and there is a wide variety of jobs available. The downside is that once you graduate and get that first job, it is very hard to get into a different industry or a different role in the same industry.

Let's say you graduate and start working in the manufacturing division of a medical device manufacturer. After a few years it grows boring and you want to try something else. Want to work as a designer for a car company? You have no chance of landing that job. You are considered to have the same experience as somebody fresh out of college for that job, but will be needing a bigger salary to match your raises at your previous job. The only way to move from one industry to another would be a similar role in the new industry (manufacturing engineer of medical devices to manufacturing engineer of automobiles). Even then, it can still be difficult. Sure, the overall goals of reducing scrap, increasing production, etc. will still be the same. However, each industry will be held to different regulations that somebody with a few years experience will be expected to know. 

To move to a different role, the easiest way is to take a new position within your company (manufacturing engineer of medical devices to design engineer of medical devices). However, if you are unhappy with the industry you are in this solves nothing. 

I don't mean to use this to discourage you to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering, just a word of caution for when you are graduating and looking for that first job. If you need further examples, look into job postings for Mechanical Engineering jobs that require a few years of job experience. The specific requirements listed will show you how difficult it can be to land the job without experience in that field.",best major to study in college
