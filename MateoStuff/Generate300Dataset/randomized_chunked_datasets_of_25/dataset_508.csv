57191,"To answer the question, hard water tends to have more mineral in it. Part of the reason people don't like it is when it evaporates it leaves the mineral- often calcium or magnesium- behind and you get water spots or buildup around your faucets or deposits gunking up your pipes. I grew up in west Texas where the water was very hard. Nearly everyone in the area had brown stains on the tips of their front teeth from a lifetime of drinking calcium heavy water. The hardness of the water doesn't necessarily make it less good for you, mostly its down to what you think tastes good. As long as you aren't living in Flint, Michigan-like conditions, tap water is usually just fine and imo, best since it doesn't contribute to plastic waste or stolen water from places that need it (looking at you,  Nestle!)",best water brand

However, if OP wants to fly into Charlotte, rent a car, catch a Panthers game, drive to Asheville, visit the Great Smokys park, visit some vineyards, drive through the piedmont, sample our fine BBQ, then finish up at the beach before doubling back to Raleigh or Charlotte for the trip home, well that could work.",best state to visit in the United States

43427,"When you say ""pay per download"" I'm going to guess that is the same as ""cost per install"" (CPI) which is the term usually used in the mobile space.   And the answer is yes, many ad networks pay out on a CPI basis.  Usually, the company paying for the installs is paying somewhere around $2.50 - $3.50 and the developer/publisher is receiving around 70% of that (but this can vary wildly).  

What it comes down to, then, is conversion rates.  This gets a little tricky as different apps convert differently, and sometimes even differently per network.  For example, we manage over 2,500 apps and we have different ad networks running in different places in our waterfall for each app (mostly game apps).  Unity Ads may do well in one, but not so well in another, for example.

I think fgl_sam gave a great list of ad networks that are currently ""hot"" though it's not a definitive list.  There are many good ad networks out here in mobile and as I said, some do well in some apps and not in others.  Also, some have great fill rates and others don't (so eCPMs will be high, but overall revenue is low).  Some have good campaigns now, but will not do as well when they lose them, etc...

Also, sometimes CPI ads are not the way to go.  ""Brand"" ads are growing in popularity.  These pay out on a flat CPM or CPV (Cost per View) and are aimed at increasing brand awareness for companies and products. Some apps do much better with these types of ads and the have the added bonus of not pushing users out of your app and into others.  I suggest a healthy mix of both types, though. 

As ixidor56 points out, it will also depend on where your users are from.",best ad service for mobile applications

41526,"Since everyone's said piano I'll throw a couple of different solutions. 

Harp, it's more versatile than you think. Can do just about everything a piano can. Can get smaller models for portability. 

Accordion. It can be simple. You can solo with yourself, you can have great note dynamics, large range of good sounding options. You can then convert the left hand into free bass and play melodies with both hands as you get better. It's portable, has a nice wow factor, can play any genre of music including European traditional, jazz, classical, pop, and more. 

Piano harp and accordion would be the only three instruments I'd play to understand theory and play mostly by myself as a hobby. But if you like the sound of a particular instrument go for it. All instruments have their good qualities and the most important part of being a musician is enjoying the sound you're making.",best instrument to play
