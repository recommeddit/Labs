"I wasted so much money buying cheap pillows from Wal-Mart that went flat after a month. Then I bought a latex coconut pillow from Mattress Firm 2 years ago. 10/10 would buy that pillow again. 2 years later it's still perfect, although it doesn't smell like coconuts anymore."
"i have [this pair](https://www.amazon.com/SojoS-Mirrored-Lenses-Fashion-Sunglasses/dp/B01D2XQKXC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491884652&sr=8-1&keywords=sojos) of cheap amazon sunglasses in both the gold/pink and blue light colors and they're actually great. i didn't expect much from them but they're metal frame, reflective lenses, i get SO many compliments on them and i've seen similar pairs at Nordstrom and free people for 3x the price. i would definitely suggest them!!"
"Regarding Spotify audio quality, pretty much no one can unless they’re wearing high end headphones listening to music they are very familiar with

inb4 “but i can totally hear the difference with my $5 earbuds listening to k-pop”"
What's the difference between a shop vac and a vacuum? I've not heard of the former before and Google isn't helping clear it up
"To add to this, OP needs to understand that those fragrance types (woodsy, floral, etc) *can* (but not always) correspond to a season.  Floral scents are out of place in a cold winter and better suited for spring and summer weather, for example.  This is, of course not a hard rule.

I’d also recommend finding a decanting service that will sell better functional samples (1oz bottles usually) to get a better feel for a scent than a department store or speciality store’s samples.  

Oh, and find a good scent-neutral deodorant.  You don’t want to rock your Old Spice or whatever when you’re wearing a lovely scent."
"You would like  Google's Arts n Culture too, then. It opens a new art piece every time you open a new tab"
L'homme is my favorite scent. I try not to tell people about it because it's oh so delicious

"I already think Bergwijn is a very good winger, he's just struggled a little with his finishing in the last season. But the best football Spurs played under Mourinho was when Bergwijn was a regular starter. He missed some key chances but his movement and work rate was brilliant, and he set up good chances for others that they failed to finish.

He's got all the qualities and attitude of a very good winger, and his finishing in training is apparently fantastic, so I just hope it's a matter of time before that translates to getting 10+ goals in a season at some point soon."
"Super Nintendo. It had some of my fave games. Super Mario, Street Fighter, Final Fight, etc. But, the main reason why its my fave is I used to play with my older brothers. I cherish those memories. My fave game though, was a pc game. My fave game is Doom."
"Sorry, i tried to be funny but i overestimated by humor. Again sorry."
"I go for VS Code now because it is free and can be used across, Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.

Normally for Windows only, notepad++ is the best, but VSCode wins due to it's ubiquity"

"I get your point, but the Axios project is only about 1600 lines of code. Typescript has **files** that are 3 times the size."
"Hardcore woodwind enthusiast here:

Check out Legere synthetic reeds. 

Yes yes, I know the stigma behind synthetics, but these are made differently and are quality reeds.

I've made 1st chair allstate/all-region/university for years on those things, much to my teachers' disapproval. 

The resin isn't susceptible to humidity and temperature, they're much more durable (they don't permanently wear out!), and it really opens up your upper register. 

I use them on all my saxes (though I still like cane for bari, except when I'm playing jazz) and clarinets (minus the contras).

Still can't beat cane for double reeds though."
If you have pure aloe vera gel and 80% alcohol....you can make your own sanitizer. There are recipes online to DIY.
Yeah Australia definitely nobody can beat them but if you make a Greatest X1 for WI England India or SA you can't say England will definitely beat the other 3.
