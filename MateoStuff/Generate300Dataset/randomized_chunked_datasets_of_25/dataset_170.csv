3195,best webcamera,"the 'low light setting"" on the c922 makes it look much better then the c920 for people that dont use professional lighting setups. Also its usually on sale for 50(black friday)-75 dollars. I upgraded from the c920 to the c922 and never looked back. The Personify Chroma cam thing is garbage though and wont use it."

11097,best backpack for college,"You can send it to the company with a nice note; they'll probably either repair or replace it. It will cost you the cost of shipping it to them (in the US.)

Mine had some rips, one area it had worn through the fabric, and was generally a (still beloved) mess. They replaced the straps, patched the worn area, replaced the long-since torn mesh with a more durable cloth, and cleaned it. It's beautiful again!"

44368,best items under $100,"Dentist here. Cochrin review showed Sonicare no better then regular toothbrush. The best automatic is the Oral-b. What makes it good is the fact that the head oscillates in a circle. 2.5 more effective at plaque removal than regular toothbrush and Sonicare. I’m going to do a Reddit oral hygiene video some time.  

Edit: Cochrane not Cochrin - it was late last night and on my iphone
