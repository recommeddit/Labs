I switched to superagent a couple of years ago. It made passing headers and pulling back blobs really simple for what I had to do.

"Qasr Al Sarab in Abu Dhabi.

It's a 7 Star hotel that it's in the middle of nowhere in the desert. It's about a 3-hour drive from the main 'hub' of Abu Dhabi.

I've been fortunate to stay there twice now. The first time was with my ex-boyfriend, his birthday was in early February, his parents gave him some money for his birthday and because it was close to Valentine's Day they had offers on rooms.

The only word to describe it is oppulent. It just feels like going to a whole other world. Because it's so far from the city you can see the stars if you go out into the desert, and the breakfast was to DIE for. It just oozes luxury.

The second time I went was for work - we were shooting a video for Etihad Airways so we got to stay FOC, we watched a falcon show and Saluki racing. Because we were there in a 'work' capacity we got to speak to the staff and I was relieved to learn the people working with the animals were really passionate about them and cared for their well-being.

I was upset to see the Saluki dogs had muzzles on -- apparently, they didn't have them before but one of the dogs spotted a deer and went for the kill, horrifying the holiday-makers who were there and traumatising a young child."
"Best hotel...Hotel Mariot in Taba Heights, Egypt Red sea resort. I'v stayed in many shitty hotels."
"You could argue the same about Ponting, but his average peaked out around 60ish."
"I like the sound of Vagabonds, haven't heard about it before now."
"Real shit üôè

Once you go bidet you don't go back. For under ~$50 the quality-of-life upgrade is astounding"
"Thanks a lot for your detailed experience! 

I don't prefer headphones with crazy bass.. like you mentioned tonality, mids, overall resolution and soundstage is what matters. So yeah, I'm more assured to get them now. Thanks!"

We had a mulberry tree. It was a space ship that grew delicious berries in the summer.
"I remember being taught in elementary that it was just based on the belief of manifest destiny and that the US wanted to buy what is now the southwest from Mexico

But Mexico refused and the Alamo happened so they ended up fighting

We were never taught the real reasons why

 like white southerners bringing slaves into Texas despite Mexico forbidding it

The area being underpopulated and the US avoiding to annex the rest of Mexico since the population isn't mostly white"
How the fuck we're number 32? We finished last in national league. Is it because we finished second in European Qualifiers?
"Mobius FF, free to play, get it while it‚Äôs still around. End of service will be later on mid June."
"Congrats, playing the 360 with my brother and college roommates was some of my fondest memories. So many great games, and all are probably reasonably priced. The Elder Scrolls Oblivion (the best) and Skyrim (also pretty great) and the Mass Effect Trilogy are awesome, Gears of War offers some of the most fun multiplayer and co-op modes I ever played. Oh yeah, and the Bioshock games, and Assassin's Creed, and Halo, of course, and..."
"Except it's almost guaranteed that purchasing a new one is cheaper, at least one of those velcro ones."
"I use a spreadsheet-Google Sheets.  Can‚Äôt get any more flexible than that.  Probably not for most with simple finances, but if you have many income sources, business expenses, exotic investments like crypto or crowd source, a spreadsheet is the way to go.

Good thing about Google sheets is you can access it on any machine with internet access.  I can update it from my phone too.  Not like Excel."

"Very questionable rankings based on the website you used.

Not sure about the fact that Arizona State is better than Tufts, Case Western, Univeristy of Rochester, AND Notre Dame."
"It's not bad advice, imo. I detest working with WordPress and only do so for blogs that I don't want to be bothered with making. 

That said.. there are a ton of jobs out there for places that churn out WordPress sites. If the employment landscape says WordPress, well you learn WordPress. I don't know that it does for OP."
Dental student here. We got a toothbrush from sonicare and oral B. Both seem pretty similar to me but the oral B one seems to be a lot more harsher and I think might do a better job stimulating the gums. But I like them both.

"Haha, if I had been younger than I was at that point in time, it might have been more acceptable! Hey, don't forget to get into the spirit. It's always fun to have someone in costume answer the door, if you're up for it!"
"Andrew W.K.
He was such a nice guy. My friends and I ran into him after a concert out by his tour bus. He chatted with us for a few minutes, signed some autographs, and offered me a bottle of water.

Earlier during the show, there was a young boy in the crowd who couldn't see over the rest of the crowd. Andrew W.K. summoned him up to the stage and then proceeded to pick the kid up and straddled him on his shoulders in mid song. The two of them sang the rest of the song together, all the while the crowd was going bananas. The kid had this smile on his face as if it was the best day of his life.

PARTY HARD!!!!"
I don't know. I think Gale Sayers once scored 4 touchdowns in 1 game...and then 2
