10108,"I'm a professional artist, specialized in human form, pencil, ink, digital color. Been drawing unrelentlessly since I was a kid. And I want to tell you. It does not matter.

you could buy a lovely canson paper sketchbook, sweet warm color, unbeatable texture, 30 pages for 10$... or, a pack of laser copy paper (legal size), that'll be about 400 pages for less than 5$. At the beginning you want quantity, not quality, yo want to churn out sheets of paper as if you were a xerox machine. And you need to deattach yourself from those early drawings, you don't want to be careful, you will make lots of mistakes and it would be a pity to waste good pencils and paper on such awful stuff. 

Trust me. I still use that kind of cheap paper, with ballpen, or whatever pencil (usually 2 or 3B), marker, charcoal, or instrument I had around. I still practice everyday and loads of those sketches end up in the recycle bin. They're trash.  Now, I have some nice sketchbooks for when I'm feeling fancy or I'm working on a theme and I want to keep track of everything, but that comes later.

there's one thing I would spend my money on. Pencils, that makes a real difference, and can change the whole feeling, if you can find them, cretacolor art pencils are the bomb, this austrian brand mixes graphite with clay and those are the softer, more enjoyable and lovely pencils I've ever used, I wouldn't go for less than B or 2B, buy loads, but ultimately try everything, everyone has a different feel.

get yourself a legal, letter, or smaller sketchbook, and use it as a reward once a week, or once every 100 sheets of legal paper, and you'll keep track of your advance, skimming tons of rubbish. You definitely want to produce tons of rubbish to get better.

Don't get too attached, be relentless with yourself and be your worst critic, making a drawing that doesn't look that bad is ok, but if you conform with that, you'll be lying to yourself and plateau in a shitty confort zone.

get Betty Edwards's ""Drawing with the right side of the brain"". do EVERY exercise, religiously. I've seen the most amazing results with people I've trained and myself.

Try, please try, to find a drawing circle, with live models, naked preferably, using photos as a reference is ok, but trust me, nothing beats seeing some in 3D and translating it in 2D. it works totally different parts of your brain.

practice everyday. copy the masters, pay respect, study them, learn from them. Go to a museum. See how they solve problems. Don't worry too much about copying, you'll find your own solutions at some point, and they'll be more interesting.

the more you learn, the clearer you see what's lacking in your skill set, right now just doodle. 

have fun! if it gets frustrating, (it will) draw something different to clean the slate, go for a walk, draw something you wouldn't ever draw, draw your pencil sharpener, a hanging jacket, everything adds up.

Cheers, if you have more questions lemme know.",best pencil for drawing

29954,"I am currently using [Financisto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.orangesoftware.financisto).

Pros:

- it is highly customizable
- it provides a lot of functionalities, making it easy to classify and separate the incomes and expenses.
- it offers cloud backup in Google Drive or Dropbox.

Cons:

- it is an open source project of some guy, so nothing fancy.
- its interface is very simple (sometimes ugly).
- it doesn't synchronize with bank accounts, so all operations are manual.

I tried other apps but some of them were too complicated or didn't have the features I was looking for.

To give you some idea, I know how much I spend in each category
(food, tax, house, ...) and I also can control savings.
So far I could control my expenses and save per month a decent amount.",best money managing app
