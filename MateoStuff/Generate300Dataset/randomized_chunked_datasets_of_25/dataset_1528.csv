54683,"I've owned both. I liked the zero water while I had it, since it filters a lot more stuff than the Brita filter does. Most importantly, the zero water filters removed lead, which was an issue where I lived. Brita filters are just activated carbon, which are only effective at removing chlorine. The thing I didn't like about the zero water filter was that it didn't hold much water. Brita sells much larger jugs which I liked better. Once lead was no longer an issue in my water, I switched back to Brita because I only needed to remove the chlorine, and they held more water.",best water filter

They won't get the views they would if they stuck to something more recent that is available in shops.  Not to mention if they get review copies of games shipped to them from publishers, no one will send them a copy of a classic game unless there is a reprint.",best board games
