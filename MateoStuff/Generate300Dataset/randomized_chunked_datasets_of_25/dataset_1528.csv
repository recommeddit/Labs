27251,best stocks to buy,Not so good at counting to 5 ;)
54683,best water filter,"I've owned both. I liked the zero water while I had it, since it filters a lot more stuff than the Brita filter does. Most importantly, the zero water filters removed lead, which was an issue where I lived. Brita filters are just activated carbon, which are only effective at removing chlorine. The thing I didn't like about the zero water filter was that it didn't hold much water. Brita sells much larger jugs which I liked better. Once lead was no longer an issue in my water, I switched back to Brita because I only needed to remove the chlorine, and they held more water."
34303,best NFL player,They crucified him for those bs DPIs against Hopkins. In what world do you lead the league in picks (10) and you aren't even in the top 50 PFF players?
14854,best romantic novel,It really deserves the tag!
11915,best gifts for dad,"My dad and I used to watch wiley coyote when I was a kid, it washes favourite cartoon. I bought him a dvd of all of those cartoons for less than Â£2. ( I am super skint right now, so I guess it is the thought that counts).  I would have taken him to the pub for a pint of bitter but we live 4h away from each other. Get something with memories attached if you can."

4818,best home improvement store,"Here is a helpful site for Washer/Dryers
http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-washer-and-dryer/

HD for building materials and Lowes for gardening stuff. Also look for sales on stuff like Duraflame logs and Bounty Towels. These two products will be on sale between the two stores multiple times a year.

Finally good luck on the new home and all Chimney Repairmen are crooks."

Opens very fast. Development is very agile and they are adding useful features like every fortnight. 

one last thing it comes pre-install."
57701,best cologne,"Trust me when I say this:

Comme Des Garcons - Amazingreen

Best cologne I've ever had, and the only one I use since I've gotten it."
65863,best college in california,I think they have 20% of the incoming class as out of state.
51122,best rap album,"I can't believe anyone takes these lists seriously. I'm sure everyone here can name dozens of highly popular and acclaimed albums that weren't on there, essentially making the list meaningless, yet we still need to have a thread to complain about it. Really? These threads tend to be the most popular in the subreddit as well."
64724,Best Nike running shoes,"1. Wear shoes that feel comfortable to YOU.

2. The advantage to Brooks at al. is you know you are getting a *running* shoe. Nike, adidas, etc also sell non-running shoes--soccer, basketball, ""lifestyle."" And yes, even at sports stores like Lady Foot Locker. So there is more to sort through when it comes to the all-around brands."
70546,best major to study in college,Thanks!

15634,best sunglasses for fashion,"We've done suits, and there is a decent amount of overlap, but these are worth talking about."
42813,best detective show,THE MENTALIST
30995,best country to live in,"Terrible health care system, though. That's the biggest downside of the U.S. in my opinion. Most of the population is one accident from disaster."
27071,best board games,"It is, but in the case of the subject study I think that makes sense as well.  Many more new reviewers who aren't going to go out of their way to look at something released 10+ years ago because it's long OOP.  

They won't get the views they would if they stuck to something more recent that is available in shops.  Not to mention if they get review copies of games shipped to them from publishers, no one will send them a copy of a classic game unless there is a reprint."
25443,best cricket teams of all time,Australia 2015 WC lineup deserves a mention along with ENGLAND 2018. Both teams bat deep with the tail enders capable of hitting atleast one six.
