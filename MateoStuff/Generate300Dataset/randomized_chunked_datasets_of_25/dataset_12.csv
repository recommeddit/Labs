May I ask what kind problems do you work on with Bayesian methods? As other posters have said, Bayesian models are generally slower to train and do not result in quite as good results as say, XGboost. 

I have read some parts of statistical rethinking, watched the course videos on youtube, read Bayesian Methods for Hackers  plus a mishmash of other resource and I still cannot really think of a problem where I'd rather use a bayesian model over the usual suspects (xgboost, lightgbm). The only place I might use say, pymc3, is if it's an inference problem and I have to come up with solid numbers to back my claim so I'm curious to know what others use it for."

30117,best Mexican war to study,Yeah itâ€™s part of it. As someone else commented above the French and Indian war was a theatre of the larger Seven Years War. Though I believe the French and Indian War was a little longer. And it was France and England (US wasnâ€™t a country yet).
