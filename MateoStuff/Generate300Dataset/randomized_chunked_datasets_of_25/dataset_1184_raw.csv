Ok thanks dude hoping to jailbreak really soon is xenhtml compatible on iOS 14.3?
Nectar makes some sweet sunnies. I've been really happy with all the pairs from them I've tried. They're like 40 bucks and usually on sale.
"If you're doing that, it just means you're brushing ***far*** too hard. You're almost certainly scarring your gums and wearing micro-fissures into your enamel. You need to just focus your mind on being more gentle when you brush. A typical ***Soft-bristled*** brush head should last you 3-4 months. You should not use anything more stiff than soft bristles. 

An electric toothbrush will probably help you, though, simply because you don't need to do any brushing motion at all when using one. You just hold it against your teeth and let its movement do the cleaning for you, taking care to reach all the different parts and sides of your mouth and teeth.

I would personally recommend that, when you buy an electric toothbrush, you bring it with you to your dentist and ask them to show you how to use it properly. If you're still holding it too forcefully against your teeth, it will do damage."

"To be fair, async/await is promises+generators, so something that only supports promises is not quite equivalent.  It's like saying that promises and callbacks are basically the same thing."

"I try and buy a different paper each day - the subsidised rates at my Student Union make it possible. Normally I focus on the broadsheets - The Times, the Telegraph, the Guardian and the FT from time to time, but more and more the Independent. I only read tabloids if they're the only thing available, mostly because so much of it is just unbearable tripe.

I also subscribe to The Economist, and cherish my weekly copy."
"I got mine years ago at a Kroger in a small town.. so probably yes.

It has totally changed my dental cleanings... before the Sonicare I was usually scheduled for 30-45 minutes because I just wasn't that good at brushing and can't get it together to floss (partly because my teeth are close together). Now it always takes 15 minutes.. they still admonish me about flossing but I'm always amazed when we're done."
"Chionanthus retusis! PLEASE! 

Very underutilized tree; great orange fall color, beautiful bark and nice branch architecture, and great white spring flower. 

Very very drought tolerant. 

If you want the native, Chionanthus virginicus, it needs clay acidic soil; I think you’d be better off with the Chinese one, but even the Chinese one isn’t aggressive and won’t become invasive. 

Great great tree. Highly recommend."
Look at all the Amans for Asia. Stay at a Singita in Africa. The LVMH hotels - Cheval Blancs. Pick a specific country and I’ll tell you where I’d stay.
"I'm from West Virginia, and there is a reason you can't spit without hitting something named after him. I don't know how to feel about the ways he got money to the state, but I honestly can't imagine what my home state would look like without his influence."
"Here's a nice text editor benchmark on [github](https://github.com/jhallen/joes-sandbox/tree/master/editor-perf).

I started with notepad++ on WinXP and when sublime text came out in 2008 I've used that every day.

My favorites are:

1. Sublime text
1. Vim
1. VS Code
1. Jetbrains IDE

I use them all equally as they're tools to get a task done.

Sublime for scratch.txt, a fast launch and browsing tons of files.

Vim for editing text and running macros or opening 1 GB text files quickly. Vim > sublime for performance.

I'm writing this in VS Code w/ markdown preview. And for a live preview of LaTeX.

Regular expressions are 100% the same in sublime and VS code (and I think Jetbrains too).

I've made all my 4 editors follow hotkeys from Jetbrains (Intellij, GoLand). 

| key      | action           |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| ctrl + y | delete line      |
| ctrl + d | duplicate line   |
| ctrl + w | expand selection |
| ctrl + 4 | close tab        |
| alt + 1  | toggle side bar  |"
"Give me a day where I don't have to worry about anyone but myself. I'm tired of watching my actions and second guessing everyone's reactions. I just want to bust up some games or whatnot, smoke a doobie, drink a few beers and not have to worry that my introversion is considered rude or unfriendly."

"The Xbox 360 got loads of good games! I strongly recommend Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite, Red Dead Redemption, Fallout 3 and the Batman Arkham games"

"It was great, wouldve loved if they went more in depth on the dystopian future, but other than that i have no complaints"
The beauty of this game is making something competitive out of a pile of crap. It also happens to out mechanic the mechanic simulators. It really is a special experience and I wish there were more games that captured this experience.
