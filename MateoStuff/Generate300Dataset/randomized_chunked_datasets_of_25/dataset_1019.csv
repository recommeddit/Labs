38773,"brave browser,

1. its just a tiny bit harder to use but has some useful features built in
2. its faster than chrome and uses less ram,

3, they had a few problems but not privacy wise other than the tor one but normal users probably wouldnt use that feature,

4. im pretty sure you can do that, i dont really use bookmarks but its probably good

5. i dont know how fast chrome opens but on my old pc it took a bit longer for brave to start than firefox, with my current pc it takes less than 2 seconds for it to open and fully load.

23226,"Your example is contrived. It's not possible to target based on race among other things.

Sure, there are people working on it. So, no it's not in the business model and it's going to be fine without it.
Lobbying to prevent regulation? Did you research this too? What regulation are you talking about? What regulations would you like to see? Why do you think those regulations would make sense and/or are feasible? The only thing I've seen from regulation is that nowadays I have to click on accepting cookies for every website.
In your argument about equality, you are only looking at one side of the coin: the people being advertised to. What about opportunities for the advertisers? Why are you forcing advertisers to waste money? Increase their marketing budgets and putting up a barrier to entry for smaller operations while not hurting the big players?",best social networking site for CS
