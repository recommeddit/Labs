"ghost busters, super 8, 5th Element, LOTR (obviously, and get the extended version if possible),  2001 space odyssey, blade runner, blues brothers, The Avengers, Sherlock (BBC and Robert Downey Jr. versions), Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, the never-ending story, Aladdin, the Lion King, Mulan, the Wizard of Oz, Faris Bueller's day off, Wayne's world, Kick ass, Pan's Labyrinth, Serenity (and firefly series obviously) and finally not a movie but Game of Thrones 

those are just off the top of my head. All movies that I've seen more then once and enjoyed. 

Try to think of movies that if you turned on the tv and they were playing, you would be happy as a clam."

"Warrantied to 100k miles if there is a failure like a short or a failed battery module. Degradation has been pretty good for Tesla batteries (around 5-10% after 100k miles). The battery should last around \~300k miles.

Replacement is probably a \~6 hour job (no different than changing a transmission), outside of the cost of the battery (which we don't really know how much a new battery in a model 3 will cost). They say a battery module (not the entire battery) will cost 3-7k to replace. Whatever that means.

Honestly, it seems pretty similar to if a transmission or an engine goes in a 3 series. So it's right up the ball park. I feel like I'm getting my moneys worth with this car."
"Really for a 3.5 year old a grown dog/cat are likely the only common pets that are going to sturdy enough to hold their own if a preschooler plays too rough with it.

Assuming all interaction with the pet will be well supervised then a large rat would be a good choice. They are less delicate than hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, reptiles and most other small animals; although a tight squeeze or child falling on top of them would still be potentially horrific events. Plus most tend to love to get up close to people and get lots of pets & attention. They are smart and can quickly learn little tricks. They are also pretty clean and will usually avoid going to the bathroom unless they are in the corner of their cage that they have designated for that.

Biggest downside is the all chewing. Rats (and all other rodents) are going to spend half their day gnawing on things. However being in a playroom rather than a bedroom at least means they hopefully aren't going to keep anyone up all night listening to them chewing up everything and anything in their cage."

"Batwing and Wild One are both fantastic. Joker's Jinx and Superman are serviceable clones with better versions found elsewhere. Roar is okay. Mind Eraser and Apocalypse have pretty scenery, at least."
"This seems pretty obsolete as of now, they added some collaborators and a lot of issues and PRs have been resolved."

It's slow burn romance with great characters. Grace Draven has way of writing romance. Hope you will like it.
"I have blues in my Das Keyboard Ultimate Model S. Honestly, unless you are an invested pro gamer who wants to tweak every fine detail of his gaming performance, the way the keys feel while typing is going to quickly become more important than gaming.

Having an actuation point at a certain spot can feel nice while wandering between WASD an 1-9, but having the keys feel good while rapidly typing hundreds of characters is far more valuable in my opinion. 

Again, this is assuming that you aren't an invested pro gamer who needs to max his performance in CS:GO or whatever."
