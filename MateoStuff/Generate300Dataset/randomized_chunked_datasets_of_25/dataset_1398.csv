23085,best celebrity,"Peter Dinklage was in town for our comic expo in Calgary and i was playing blackjack at the casino by the expo center with my bestie.  

Pit boss kept coming to all the dealers and whispering in their ear.  Girl then looks at us and says: you two watch game of thrones?

I say yes.  She says: oh apparantly some famous guy from the show is over there playing blackjack...

Sure enough he's there playing blackjack.  We cash out and head to his table and sit down.

He asked if we were on a date to which my bestie replied she was gay and i am definitely not a woman haha.  Dinklage actually goes: well my foot tasted great haha.  Ended up playing blackjack with him for over an hour and drinking on his tab.  Super down to earth and polite.
