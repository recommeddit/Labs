For Mexican I really love Taqueria El Bajio (their tortas, sopes, gorditas...YUM) and definitely Lillys Tacos. 

There's also Flavor of India for Indian, which is pretty good too.

I don't deny that. Avatar was massively popular too, despite being absolute crap. (I'm not saying HP is crap.)

And I said the ""famous for being famous"" concept only applies to a certain extent. There are better books/series out there that never became massively famous to the extent that HP is.",best action and adventure novel series

In my startup, I get every member on my team to read this as required reading. It's *that* good (methinks).

That said, the relevant part to your question (that you'll learn from the book) can be summed up by the **Eisenhower Matrix**. There's lots of articles about this concept (just Google it), but one article that explains this well is from James Clear (he write well and gets to the point quickly).

*DISCLAIMER. I am not a doctor. Talk to a doctor before you go uber stupid with an idea. If you can't breathe? Call 911. If you want to read a suggestion from a ""pantry medic""? you have been warned that this is a random redditor telling you random ideas*

This is a miserable process but works amazingly well.

Take a glass of luke warm water. (You need something not hot because you will drink it fast... and not cold because you will drink it fast)

Add cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp is more than enough for ""damn I'm stuffed with phlegm"" and feel like hell. Start with that. You can up the dose and repeat/up the process if needed)

Drink the funky mixture while standing over your kitchen sink - NO JOKE. DO NOT TAKE THIS WITH CARPET NEARBY!

It will suck going down and in about 2 minutes you will start coughing..... up... shit from.... your toes......  It's not fun. You will hack up boogers that you ate at age 3. You need to do this over your kitchen sink.

The cayenne will dilate the ""tubes"" in your lungs and shit will start moving and sliding and shaking.

If you need to repeat or up the dose? You will know how to modify the home-remedy. You'll know that you need to put in more cayenne or stay at that recipie and try again.....

Take a few hours break before each ""Going to cough everything out of my body that has ever been slimy"" trial.

Best of luck.",best medicine for a cold
