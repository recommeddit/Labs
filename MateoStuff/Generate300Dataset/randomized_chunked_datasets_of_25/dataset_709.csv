64991,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"There's not a ton of good Asian food in SB, but Muen Fan for Thai is not bad. 

For Mexican I really love Taqueria El Bajio (their tortas, sopes, gorditas...YUM) and definitely Lillys Tacos. 

There's also Flavor of India for Indian, which is pretty good too.  

Slightly more expensive but Zaytoon has good mediterranean/middle eastern food and a great ambiance, lovely outdoor garden seating."

55575,best action and adventure novel series,"> JK Rowling was nobody before her first book took off, and the only reason it took off is because people (of all ages) loved reading it.

I don't deny that. Avatar was massively popular too, despite being absolute crap. (I'm not saying HP is crap.)

And I said the ""famous for being famous"" concept only applies to a certain extent. There are better books/series out there that never became massively famous to the extent that HP is."

63654,best books for time management reddit,"This!

In my startup, I get every member on my team to read this as required reading. It's *that* good (methinks).

That said, the relevant part to your question (that you'll learn from the book) can be summed up by the **Eisenhower Matrix**. There's lots of articles about this concept (just Google it), but one article that explains this well is from James Clear (he write well and gets to the point quickly). 

See: http://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box

This, if done correctly, is enough to help you with your time management issues but if you're inclined, you should still check out the book. Here's the [Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451639619/ref=s9_psimh_gw_p14_d2_i4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=01EP9BSWT7R9K2FC6TY9&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1688200382&pf_rd_i=507846)."

54322,best medicine for a cold,"When you say cold - I'm thinking coughy-stuffy-snot-factory with no fever situation, right?

*DISCLAIMER. I am not a doctor. Talk to a doctor before you go uber stupid with an idea. If you can't breathe? Call 911. If you want to read a suggestion from a ""pantry medic""? you have been warned that this is a random redditor telling you random ideas*

This is a miserable process but works amazingly well.

Take a glass of luke warm water. (You need something not hot because you will drink it fast... and not cold because you will drink it fast)

Add cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp is more than enough for ""damn I'm stuffed with phlegm"" and feel like hell. Start with that. You can up the dose and repeat/up the process if needed)

Drink the funky mixture while standing over your kitchen sink - NO JOKE. DO NOT TAKE THIS WITH CARPET NEARBY!

It will suck going down and in about 2 minutes you will start coughing..... up... shit from.... your toes......  It's not fun. You will hack up boogers that you ate at age 3. You need to do this over your kitchen sink.

The cayenne will dilate the ""tubes"" in your lungs and shit will start moving and sliding and shaking.

If you need to repeat or up the dose? You will know how to modify the home-remedy. You'll know that you need to put in more cayenne or stay at that recipie and try again.....

Take a few hours break before each ""Going to cough everything out of my body that has ever been slimy"" trial.

Best of luck."

32739,best vacation resort,"Thank you and yes this is what I meant. We don't want to have to drive. I'm not looking to discover DR. We are looking to get away from our 3 kids and drink, dance, and unwind without a schedule. I have vacationed a lot in the FL Keys but you have a tiki bar and maybe one restaurant other than that you have to drive. I refuse to drink and drive. The resort with all the food and drink and activities sounds like what we want. We just don't want to be blindsided."

61819,Best RPG game on PS4,"It is! The endings aren't so much endings as...plot lines in the overarching game, ending A gives you the bade story, the second ending/playthrough expands on that, and the 3rd and on give you content you have not experienced to continue the story."
64192,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"You can also download ""1 hour loan"" books from Archive.org (which normally don't allow downloads) using a bookmarklet with the following script:

    javascript:window.location=window.location.protocol+'//'+window.location.hostname+'/services/loans/loan/?action=media_url&identifier='+window.location.pathname.split(""/"").pop()+'&format=pdf&redirect=1'

You will get a URLLink.acsm, which you open using Adobe Digital Editions to download a DRMed PDF (same with ""14 day loan"" books) - you then import that PDF into Calibre (with apprenticeharper's
DeDRM_tools from GitHub installed), and you've got a DRM-free PDF of a book unavailable anywhere else. Might be blurry, unoptimised PDF/A, without indexes, which, if you're really serious about that book, you can fix using a pirate's version of ABBYY FineReader or Adobe Acroba Pro."

35434,best alcoholic drink,"One of my favorites is a tall glass with a shot or two of vodka in it with strong, sugary lemonade"
37170,best amusement park,"Having grown up in OC, Disneyland and DCA would be my vote for the overall experience, food, theming and rides, but If you're really into roller coasters and thrill rides, I'd say Knotts. It's a good value and the food is getting really great, IMO. Six Flags would be an option but it's a hike from Santa Ana so, meh. Save yourself the drive. 

Seaworld is a skip for me even tho I loved it as a kid. Universal is kinda boring IMO, all the rides there are basically virtual ""put 3D glasses on"", unless you're a big Harry Potter fan it's a skip for me too."
