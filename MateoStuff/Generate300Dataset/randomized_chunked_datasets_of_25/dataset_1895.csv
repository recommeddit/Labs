>**What pissed off the Axis? US Trade Policy**
>What pissed off the US? Japan bombing Pearl Harbor

I don't think so. The Japanese pre-emptively attacked the US because they believed a conflict between the two powers over the Pacific was inevitable, and they wanted to strike pre-emptively in order to have free-reign to expand for a bit. Although the US oil embargo hurt Japan, it wasn't the catalyst for war."
