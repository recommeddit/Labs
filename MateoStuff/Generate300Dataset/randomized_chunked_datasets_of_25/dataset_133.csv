30515,best Mexican war to study,"In terms of the size of each country's standing army, both were pretty even. As you mentioned, the U.S. was a healthier nation, and much more industrialized. During the colonial period, Spain did not do much to industrialize itself, mainly because of all the wealth the colonies were producing, it could simply buy manufactured goods. Also, it didn't want industrialization in the colonies, fearing that was the reason the English Colonies had managed to successfully break from England. Another problem was the way the military was ran in Mexico. It still used the Spanish custom of buying commissions, or being given one simply because of family status. By this time most of the senior officers who had any formal experience had retired, since they were veterans of the wars for independence. General Santaanna tried to fix this by awarding comissions and promotions based on merit. Unfortunately the process is slow, and he couldn't transform Mexico's Military in time to contend against the United States."

64266,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"[http://audiobookbay.nl/](http://audiobookbay.nl/)  You'll need to make a FREE account (no credit info). I've been using it for 6 months with no problems. 

You'll need 2 apps (that are FREE). I listen to all my books on my phone 

Smart AudioBook Player and uTorrent (I got them from the Android Play store.)

As long as someone is seeding the book you want, it will download.  The uTorrent will tell you the amount of seeders.

Hope this helps!

45753,best trick or treating candy,"Ha, the news just said the best candy to give out is 3 Musketeers!

I think the worst are those gross peanut butter things that are in orange and black wrappers. I think the Mexican candy (like Lucas and those mango/chili suckers) that gets handed out is pretty gross but my nieces all love that shit.

I need to go get some candy, I think. Is it weird to hand out candy if I don't have any kids myself? I've been in my neighborhood since July and I've seen one toddler and a couple older teens/younger adults. I know there are more kids since a couple school buses come by (and I live pretty close to a school, so close that I can hear the morning announcements if I'm in my backyard).. but I haven't seen any trick-or-treat age kids.

All you weirdos can send me your candy corn, circus peanuts and tootsie rolls!! Nobody hands out circus peanuts but my nieces all give me their candy corn and tootsie rolls. The former is my boyfriend's favorite and the latter is one of mine!"

2357,best headphones,"I happen to have the HD 598 and I love it so much that I bought more for family members. I use it with the LG G7 (has the quad DAC) and in several ways, I like it more than some more expensive open back headphones. 


Are there any wireless headphones that are of the same quality as the HD 598? To be blunt, I sure haven't tried any that come close and I think it is going to be difficult to find good wireless headphones that come close to benchmark open back headphones. 

It may be the case that there are Bluetooth headphones that are better but it would likely be the ones that are expensive (more than the Airpods Max) as those are the ones I haven't tried. There are wireless headphones that sound good but going wireless and having ANC is going to have a negative impact on sound quality. 

ANC is also expensive tech and getting a premium Bluetooth pair of headphones with tons of features also raises the price so it is understandable why they are this price despite not offering the same sound quality (although the Airpods Max is still too much for what it offers)."

66567,best soccer team in the world,"Clubwise there are a few...

**Milan 1989** Maldini, Baresi, Costacurta, Gullit, Ancelotti, MVB, Riijkard.

**Madrid 2001** Zidane, Hierro, Carlos, Makelele, Figo, Casillas, Raul.

**Milan 05/07** Maldini (Still) Nesta, Gattuso, Pirlo, Kaka, Seedorf, Inzaghi, Cafu. Shevchenko, Crespo Stam..

**Barcelona 2009** Messi, Eto'o, Henry, Xavi, Iniesta, Puyol, Abidal.

If either Barcelona or Real Madrid win the UCL this year, they could possibly be added to this list, especially offensive wise.

International

**Brazil 2002** Cafu, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Kaka, Ceni, Carlos, Lucio, Dida, Juninho, Denilson. That squad was ridiculous.

These are the ones I can think of off the top of my head, feel free to say anymore."

18044,best Kardashian,"The flaw that they *all* have is not being honest or up front about the work they've had done on their bodies. With the exception of Kendall, they've all had boob jobs. Kim, Khloe, and Kylie have all had Brazilian butt lifts, fat transfers or something to that effect. They've all had *lots* of help, and it's not just having a personal trainer. I don't mind that they've had the work done, I just wish they'd be more upfront about it."
