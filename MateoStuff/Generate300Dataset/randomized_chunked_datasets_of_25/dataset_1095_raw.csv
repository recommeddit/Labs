"There are many ways to classify boardgames and I think you should first think about what kind of gaming experience you want before reading all of these lists. Here's what you should look for:

**1) Number of players:** Some games are deigned exclusively for 2 players, while others are designed for higher player counts.

**2) Weight:** Not all games are equally complex. Weight is subjective, but if you want a general idea:

- *Light:* simple rules that can be explained in <5 min. Most of these games play fast as well, usually lasting 5-30 minutes. Some of these are also labelled as party games. Usually come in smaller boxes and don't take too much table space.

- *Medium:* slightly more complex rules. Usually can be explained in <10-15 minutes. Tends to last longer too, around 30-90 minutes and often takes more table space.

- *Heavy:* complex games with lots of rules. Usually take >20 minutes to explain and >90 minutes to play. Often take the whole table. Some of these games you need to play a couple times before you get a good grasp of the strategy.

**3) Type:** Games are often classified by the mechanics they use, but for now the main thing you should know is:

- Cooperative vs competitive : Some games are cooperative, which means players are working together and trying to win against the game.


Now if you want suggestions, I would reccomend sticking with light/medium games at first and then work your way to heavier games if you think these would interest you. Many other answers to this thread have some great suggestions."

Playing in friendlies actually hurts your ranking. It’s beets to do too many subs so the same doesn’t count and doesn’t hinder you. Always scheduling friendlies against the right teams. Certain countries have somewhat gamed the rankings before to get themselves higher seeds. I think Switzerland might have.
"the greatest QB ever is the the greatest player ever because nobody at any other position can impact that game like a QB

The case used to be that Montana was Jordan, and Brady was Lebron, but that has changed. Brady hasnèt usurped Montana as Jordan, now there are 2 Jordans.

People can tell me that's a cop out, but it's the right answer, damn it"

"The Spanish are VERY family friendly, as are the Italians. There are some immigration perks for Spain and they are encouraging to immigration and property ownership if you have resources. It's also affordable. 
NZ is beautiful and has so much different terrain. Low crime, friendly, eco friendly, clean air, don't see much poverty. Doesn't matter though, you'll never get a visa. Maybe that's why it's great, they're very discriminating with who they let in."
"I dont know why anyone who lives or works  in a metropolitan area would want a brand new car of any kind. People in Boston for example are magnetically attracted to parking next to new cars, apparently so they can open their door too wide and dent the hell out of them. Or just slam into them from behind when parallel parking. This is not just my last new car, I saw this every day before the pandemic started. Apparently most humans don't understand how momentum  works.

I'd consider a used Tesla if you're going to get one; at least you know any kinks have been worked out,  plus insurance and any state excise tax bill will be lower.

"> Pretty sure the P3D that went faster around the Streets was modified with wider tires and upgraded brakes?

IIRC they were the same size, just a cup2 rather than a PS4S and upgraded pads. The stock car went a 1:23.90. About as quick as an M4 and quicker than a GT PP1.  Also, remember that the Alfa comes with ridiculous tires from the factory. 


Either way, pulling that kind of time with just tires and pads is certainly not ""just ok"". Especially when you consider it's doing all this for $60k.

>The 3 is absolutely in that class, it may be as expensive as the true Luxury cars, but it isn't one, it simply does not have the interior to fit in that segment.

I don't really agree with that. It's not on the level of the A4, G30, or C-Class. But It's definitely as good if not better than the IS and Q50. It's was also on par with the F30. 

I don't think having worse interior quality is a solid argument for classifying the car in an entirely different category. If you set aside the interior, the 3 is priced like the Germans, it's a similar size to the Germans, it's RWD or AWD like the Germans, and performs like the Germans. You have to ignore all of those factors in order to put it amongst a bunch of FWD econoboxes.

It also seems that you've changed your tune. [""This is an 80k performance sedan, not a 15k family car""](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/94bgnk/tesla_model_3_performance_track_test/e3jvko7/)"
