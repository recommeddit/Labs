"Love Forever War, toss up between that and Gateway for my bonus pick. Both have stayed with me years after reading them. 

I loved the Blue Ant trilogy too. Have you read the Bridge trilogy? Why wife **loves** that collection, especially Virtual Light. Do you prefer Blue Ant to Bridge and Sprawl trilogies?"

"Wow. This is impressive and helpful. Thanks for the detailed reviews of these cases.

I’ve been on a quest to find a thin, clear TPU case that doesn’t have a screen lip. I had a totallee case for my iPhone X that was like this and it was perfect. Their iPhone 12 cases all have a raised screen lip now, though. Same for peel, who used to always make a thin soft TPU clear case with button cutouts and only a camera lip.

Did you happen to find one through this journey?"
"Pretty much anything by RTJ is great workout material, especially Run The Jewels (the song), All Due Respect, and Close Your Eyes

Big Beast by Killer Mike is also dope"
It's my birthday too! Can we pretend you have 2 dads on that day?
Get a britta (or other brand) pitcher for your fridge. Quality is basically the same and better than some name brands (Dasani). And it helps cut down on plastic waste.

Does the second hold up to the first? I kind of like where we got dropped off at the end of Hyperion.
awesome. and which is your favourite of all the pads for those games?
If they make it over the Chiefs I wouldn't complain too much. Bills and their fans deserve a Super Bowl.
I don't understand why this is being downvoted. Exactly the movie that came to mind.
Exactly the same for me! I want the perfect compromise between trendy and be safe with the case!
"Met Mr Rogers years ago in a drug store. He was SUPER nice to the several people that had been quietly following him around the store. His wife on the other hand, seemed annoyed with it."
"I used to use fiji, but moved on to hawkridge when it came out because my wife told me it smelled like we were having sex tonight. 

I've gotten the same compliment at work, but I'd think they'd say that regardless because it's a mental hospital."
The 11 doesnt have 3D touch??? Thats news to me
"You know you can use the remaining balance on another purchase, right?"
I did tap it knowing fully what the consequences were.
Any idea if these Chrome or MW bags would be small enough for a fairly short girl? I love the way they look!
"As a college-aged daughter of a dad who has been in a relationship with a potential ""step-mom"" for over a year now and lives with her, at what time did it not feel weird getting acknowledged as a potential parental figure? 
I'm 20 years old, she will never be my mother, but she's with my dad and she is someone's mother and she treats us well. What do I do for her?"
Charles Aznavour.
wow usually stories on reddit don't get me like that

"*Magician* (split into *Magician: Apprentice* and *Magician: Master* in most editions) was one of my favourite books when I was young, and still one I enjoy coming back to from time to time. The later books he wrote don't do as well, but this trilogy and a bit of the other earlier stuff is quite enjoyable, even if it isn't literary brilliance."
I agree. They can be very interactive though. I had a betta that would always come over and recognized me and my mom. Some fish are even smarter.
