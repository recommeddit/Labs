61366,Best RPG game on PS4,"Shin Megami Tensei is basically Persona without the Highschool theme (if I remember correctly, Persona is technically a spinoff of SMT but overshadows the mainline games by now). 

SMT3 (Nocturne) is getting a HD remaster and SMT5 is supposed to be released sometime in 2021. Both are exclusive to the Switch though, much like SMT4 and Strange Journey were exclusive to the DS.

Still, Persona games are really great, even if you don't like the High school stuff. It's not quite as trope-ish as other takes on it and P5 especially puts less focus on the school setting than P3 or P4."

46673,best hand santizer brand,Idk of all Costco layouts are similar but for me it’s right at back where they have pet food and cleaning supplies. I’m kicking myself for buying the more expensive bottle last month. It was $25 for a gallon sized bottle and was off brand but had 80% alcohol content. GermX seemed like a better deal for $15 even if it doesn’t have the pump
