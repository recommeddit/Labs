8733,"I have had three separate dentists and dental hygienists say the same thing to me: If they had to choose between having me ***ONLY*** brush my teeth, or ***ONLY*** floss, they would rather I floss, without question. It's simply the far more important of the two cleaning procedures (their words), as the vast majority of cavities start in the spaces between the teeth and below the gum lines, not on the totally-exposed surfaces of the teeth.",best toothpaste

44457,"I got caught in the grand canyon once without one.  It had snowed recently and I had to all but feel my way out.  It went from decent winter afternoon light to pitch black in about 10 minutes.  I was working there and routinely did a 45 minute after shift hike.  15 down, 30 up.  I turned around as soon as the clouds rolled in, and it still took me more than an hour to get back up, nerves at maximum the whole way.  Got a light the next day.  Never go without it.  If I'm in a group, I'll bring a spare.  Because I've had that hike as well, where I was the only one with a head lamp and that wasn't a lot better.",best items under $100

he's an excellent teacher and author of the de facto standard framework for testing react components, the ""react testing library"".


if you're new to (modern) javascript in general, i'd recommend a course that goes over the basic language constructs first though. for example:

32069,"When I was roughly 13 or so years old, my parents went to a silent auction that was being held by the company my father worked at. This company is a subsidiary of Warren Buffetâ€™s so many, very wealthy people are employed.

Anyway, one of the items up for bid, was a trip where the winners would stay at a private villa on the Mediterranean Sea somewhere on the coast of Italy (canâ€™t remember exactly where) my parents bid on the trip and ended up winning. I donâ€™t remember exactly who the man was that owned the villa, but obviously someone stupid rich. 

This was a magnificent villa, straight out of the movies type of shit. Complete with a live in staff of 3 and a private beach/cove down from a cliff that you accessed via golf cart. We spent our days swimming in our own private  Mediterranean beach....what. 

The woman staff member, Angela, was the cook. An incredibly kind hearted woman. On that trip I ate some of the best food of my entire life and drank homemade limoncello every night. These meals were marathons. Course after course of the best Italian food I have ever had. Nothing Iâ€™ve had either in the states OR Italy for that matter has come even remotely close. 

Definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity, that I am eternally thankful that my parents were able to provide for me. Iâ€™ve had some other incredible travel experiences, but nothing that even comes remotely close. I think my brother still has the limoncello recipe written down somewhere, definitely need to find that one.",best hotel to live in

9457,"They keep the actual copolymer under wraps, its their secret! The thing with triclosan is if you brush with it, it washes away very easily and within minutes after brushing plaque starts forming around the teeth again. What the copolymer apparently does is stick the triclosan to the tooth for 12 hours so it stays active and prevents plaque build up. This is why colgate claims 12 hour protection when none of the other brands do.",best toothpaste

If you can't find your local regulations, check out the EPA or WHO websites. They offer a good explanation of what should and shouldn't be in your water from a health focus.
