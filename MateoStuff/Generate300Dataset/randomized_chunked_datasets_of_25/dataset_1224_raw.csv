"My old man has never seemed disappointed by a slightly above average bottle of booze. He shakes the box every time. ""Yep sounds about right!"""
"Has anyone here tried the 33store 10000 from that list? Seems like the lightest option, plus it comes with a built in cable for extra weight savings"
That sentence also sounds much better with a British accent.
"What other albums that came after it? You are really on some generalizing bullshit, the reason people love it is because it's fucking good. I hate debating people like you because you are bringing nothing but bullshit to the table. No one loves an album to not piss off a fanbase. Are you fucking kidding me? Yes you are."
"I do not have any solid proof , so I do not want to share the company name publicly. I'll PM you the company name"
Thanks for the recommendations!

"Pros: Field trips, beer, and everyone has big science beards.

Cons: Everyone has big science beards, so yours will need to be exceptional."

"The Prestige was amazing. The beauty of this ""cop out"" as people call it is how it is reflected in the movie and especially how Borden describes to the little boy: ""The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything"" F**king loved it"
"Heart of Darkness.

More of a philosophic adventure, but they do go through colonial Africa on a boat which is pretty neat to me. However, it has very dense prose which subjects from the action a bit."
"No! This is the second time a comment about my dad has made someone cry! But if you liked it, I suppose it's alright ðŸ˜Š"
"[bent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bent) looks great! Any reason not to use it? Small (1,5kb), functional, node and browser. Opinions?"
"Watson was a huge asshole.  He said he'd never hire fat people, for example (let alone blacks) He was also pretty misogynistic.  It wouldn't surprise me if he would minimize her work in order to make himself look better."
You've proven to me that a wrestling game has to be picked. What are your favorite wrestling games?
The Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories by Fritz Leiber - they're collections of loosely-connected adventures rather than single long novels for the most part. These had a huge influence on D&D games and modern RPG archetypes and tropes.

"My backpack since 9th grade till now (first year of college) is surprisingly an Adidas Originals backpack of all things. Looks nice, cheap (like 30 bucks), TONS of hidden compartments and space, fit a 15.6 inches laptop, and unbelievably durable, especially considering that I travel practically everywhere with it and abuse it terribly. Honestly I would recommend this."
"CR recommended this [one](http://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-10-6-cu-ft-Chest-Freezer-in-White-FCM11PHWW/205443672)

I linked to Home Depot because a quick google search showed they had the lowest price.

If you can find an old Sears Coldspot freezer, it'd be worth looking into.  I bought one in 2005 that was made in the late 60's and its still running strong.  Sears Coldspot freezers became Kenmore around 1977.

Edit to add:  I live just south of Memphis, TN and the freezer stays in my garage so its seen the heat and humidity of the South all its life and is still kicking."
Redline.  Even though I'm sure every bottle of it takes 3 years off of your life.
