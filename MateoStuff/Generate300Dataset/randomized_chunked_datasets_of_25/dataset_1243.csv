8394,best toothpaste,"All American brands are inferior to the innovations they have internationally. Fluoride is OK, but now we have bioglass which forms a barrier through remineralization that will prevent cavities. There are even academic studies of kids' toothpaste in Europe and Norway with far superior performance."
63740,best books for time management reddit,"I've found that systems help. It's not a book, but Cal Newport has written about scheduling everything including free time and how it has helped him feel less stressed. His blog is called Study Hacks.

David Allen's book Getting Things Done has been recommended to me by a number of people.

You also might want to try The Champion's Mind by Jim Afremow. He's a sports psychologist, but a lot of what he writes can apply to anyone.

What have you tried so far to become more productive and nervous?"

5985,best programming language for web development,"Funnily enough, I've entirely stopped using Ruby for the web and only use it for scripting either locally or server-side. I just like writing in Ruby. ""Everything is an object"" really sticks in my visual-oriented mind.

For the web it is hard not to like PHP's ""i'm everywhere so use me"" attitude. No set up, no real fuss. In comparison, setting up Django on a new machine can be a headache."

45300,best gaming system,"Agreed. I have never really liked PlayStation controllers, and the PS4 controller is the worst of the bunch. Xbox controllers have always been more comfortable and easier to use (except the original ""Duke"" controller)."
23305,best car racing video game,"Definately my favorite crash em up car in 2017, plus modding support means you can get just about any car put into the game, not only cars even: anything with wheels.

44987,best items under $100,"For me, it was a wireless power bank (phone charger). 

Story time: A whole bunch of us got our flight canceled in Amsterdam. I was literally second to last in line so we had to wait like six hours to get served. I made friends with the people around me and everyone had their phones dying. And we didn't have enough European plugs, as well, there aren't any plugs in the line to charge us up. Some had iPhones, some had Samsung, we all had different ports. People wanted to call their family back home to update or use their email. So I pulled out my power bank and got 5 people to have their phones topped up to like 15%, enough to get them through the final stretch of our ordeal until we got to our hotel.

I also had a situation where my phone usb port stopped working and just used my power bank everywhere. 

I bought it for $30 CDN online."

61264,Best RPG game on PS4,Iâ€™m playing it right now and I have a hard time liking it. Itâ€™s good in a lot of ways but also lackluster and mega wierd in so many other. I want to platinum it for my OCD but I pushed it so far back into my backlog god knows when Iâ€™ll manage.
