44987,"For me, it was a wireless power bank (phone charger). 

Story time: A whole bunch of us got our flight canceled in Amsterdam. I was literally second to last in line so we had to wait like six hours to get served. I made friends with the people around me and everyone had their phones dying. And we didn't have enough European plugs, as well, there aren't any plugs in the line to charge us up. Some had iPhones, some had Samsung, we all had different ports. People wanted to call their family back home to update or use their email. So I pulled out my power bank and got 5 people to have their phones topped up to like 15%, enough to get them through the final stretch of our ordeal until we got to our hotel.

I also had a situation where my phone usb port stopped working and just used my power bank everywhere.
