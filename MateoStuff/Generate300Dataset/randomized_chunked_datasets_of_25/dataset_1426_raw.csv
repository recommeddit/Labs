"I thought the twist was that things didn't work out in the end.  The mini twist is that it's not your average horror movie, and revealed early, but the real shocker came that there's no happy ending."
"I am a BIG believer in the ""only spend Twitch money on Twitch equipment"" mindset.

Currently using my phone as a camera, I've got my old headset with a mic, it's okay. Will probably get the first payout soon so I'll be investing a part of it in the stream equipment, but so far I've only used the stuff that I had before. My lighting is literally an old desk lamp. I have one monitor, and all my games are windowed and occupy like 3/4 of the screen so I can read the chat.

And everything is going just fine.

Don't invest until you're sure it'll pay off."
Check out Aaron Dembski-Bowden  as well and Graham McNeil to a lesser extent .
"I spent a week every summer for 10 years at Lake George. 

I LOVE upstate NY. The drive from Albany to the Canadian border is awesome, and the rest stops are so cool. 

Great picture."
"1. PS Vita

2. Xbox 360

3. PS4

4. X1

5. PS3

I also own a PS2 and a 3DS XL. I just don't have the same emotional attachment to them as I do my top 5."
"I would say, voice. The Indian classical tradition revolves around either emulating the natural sound of the voice or accompanying/supporting it.

Given today's music technology—with access to a microphone, audio I/O device and computer—you have at your disposal a melodic instrument, percussive instrument, and harmonic instrument (with the addition of looping, etc.).

I only say this because people often understate the importance of the voice as an instrument, otherwise I'd say piano."
I really loved Sea of Tranquillity by Katja Millay
I was going to post any of the Sigma Force novels! I haven't read Devil Colony yet though
I'm going to get that pack of cigarettes he seems to be having so much trouble finding!
Keep up the hard work bro. I am sure your parents are proud of you.
"There are only 3 great actors in Hindi cinema: Dilip kumar, Amitabh bachan and Mithun chakraborthy.

All 3 could take a bad subject or poor script and elevate it to the point it became believable and a hit."
"Ah, good.  Hope they don't drop that one."
"Been to SFOT once, completely agree about getting lost in that area."
"\> The PS4 has 8 cores too.

8 core, 8 threads."

"He always does a great job explaining topics, and I like watching his videos just for the visuals"
"I don't know most of these and will therefore be basing it entirely off of their names.

30s woman, generally a classy person, professional career, you enjoy artistic pursuits but don't have too much time to engage in them."
First season was pretty good. When it became about the stalker boyfriend it turned into a soap opera
Is this by purchase? Or by opinion poll?
"Beat me to it! This was my first thought; menstrual cups are such a period upgrade. Nothing disposable to run out of, and you can empty it as needed, wearing  it for up to 12 hours at a time, which is great for lighter days. 

I also just feel cleaner when using the cup. Absorbent solutions (tampons and pads etc) are great, but it’s nice to not have to deal with dryness or pads bunching. Period days involve the cup, and period underwear for backups/overnight/heavy days, and nothing else. No stress!"
"[I tried making an art house film when I was like 11 or 12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXVkH7xPgQY&list=UUjXwErWsirWQde0SA3IReHQ).  Still makes me cringe sometimes when I see it, but it's kind of heartwarming and funny in its own way."
"Overly Sarcastic Productions is pretty good.

Literature, mythology, and history"
