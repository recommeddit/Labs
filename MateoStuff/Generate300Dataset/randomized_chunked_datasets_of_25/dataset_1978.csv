38371,best newspapers to read,"The New Yorker, which I find gives an excellent, multifaceted representation of current US and international news, that's contextualised by in-depth, engaging pieces. There are many New Yorker pieces that I've read over the years that have stuck with me.

I also subscribe to a British publication called Private Eye. It basically casts a critical eye over the state of journalism and politics in the UK, and points out the hypocrisy across all British news publications equally, regardless of whether they're liberal or conservative. They also do some eye-opening investigative reporting."

I think their intent is to keep operating as a large aquarium but to eventually end all of the marine mammal shows if public opinion continues to be turned against them by animal rights propaganda."

The game doesn't actually tell you important things like the current political climate of the game's setting and why things are happening ... at all. Vital information that should have been in the game but for reasons I don't know, weren't included."
