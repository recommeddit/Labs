34289,best NFL player,But I thought the Packers had wasted Rodgers career with low talent teams??
30605,best Mexican war to study,"I guess I'll write about the wars I disagree with you on. 

Mexican American war was unjustified, a war of conquest that helped exacerbate the slavery problem, leading to the civil war. 

Civil war - justified because the south had no grievances worth secession. There has to be a bar set for any type of declaration of independence. 

Korean war - justified because it wasn't merely a small war between two small nations but an overt attack by the soviet union to extend its influence. As the only other superpower capable of standing against the USSR and maintaining a balance of power, we had a responsibility to draw a line in the sand at some point. 

Vietnam war - unjustified because we had a chance to recognize ho and Vietnamese independence but instead we sided with the French. By the time of the Johnson administration it gets murky. On one hand you want to contain the spread of soviet influence, but on the other hand we were backing a horrid south Vietnamese government. 

Gulf war - unjustified because Iraq asked us our opinion before the invasion and instead of putting our foot down we gave saddam an answer vague enough for him to feel comfortable to invade."
