"Yes, I have it right on my desk. I have the first version, so the brightness is lower than the current one. I have 6 LEDs in a row. It means that everything on the desk has 6 sharply defined shadows, which is unique but some might find it unappealing. I like it.

I's not too bright, plenty bright for night time and to help to read at dusk, but if you use it daytime, it won't make much difference.

As an aesthetic statement, it's awesome. Most people wonder what it is at first and they get kind of giddy with the +/- buttons :)

We've moved a lot, and if you do too, you will love the modularity of it. I have the round base plus the clamp base, and the light strip separates too. You can mount it the way I want it. 

I had it over 6 years now. No degradation whatsoever. One of the tiny plastic reflector cup fell off after a rough move, but nothing that a tiny dollop of crazy glue can't fix :)"
"I wish i could really remember Jerry Rice playing. I can only remember him playing for the Raiders unfortunately since i was pretty young still. 

Being a Cards fan and obviously a Larry fan i wish i could remember to judge both of their careers against each other since i want Fitz to be the GOAT WR. But obviously that title HAS to go to Rice."
Among the whole is Rob for me. Yikes what a misogynist

Hey I managed to fix it by deleting the zodttd repo while in airplane mode. I’m not sure how to send crash reports is it through cr4shed or crashreporter? Anyways thanks for all of your hard work.

"> Don't underestimate an adult's occasional escapist desire to go on a fantasy adventure.

I don't! I'm an adult, and fantasy/sci-fi is and has always been my go-to genre. I love fantasy! But there is tons of fantastic adult fantasy out there, and I don't personally understand how HP has adult appeal. I'm not saying it's terrible - but I'd take Roald Dahl or Brian Jaques any day of the week over JK Rowling. Now keep in mind, that's my OWN nostalgia kicking in. There's better stuff than HP in the children's lit world, and there's WAY better stuff out there in the YA/Adult world. That's all I'm saying. HP got popular not because it was that good - but because it was popular. It got popular for the same reason the Kardashians became popular. I realize most people will disagree with me - because I'm going against popular (there's that word again) opinion. That's fine."

"You've only ever bought $20 glasses in the store, those are cheap crap.

Its now possible to buy online much more directly from China, and purchase high quality goods for much less than in a store.

So $20-$35 glasses online are roughly the equivalent in terms of quality to $80-$130 in most stores/domestic online retailers.

I strongly suggest that you check out cheap high quality sunglasses from China and re-evaluate your opinion.
