A doctor isn't just an 8-5 job, it's a way of life. People must remember that Doctors are part of the front lines who are willing to make the right call in the given situation. It's more than a grade, but a person who is willing to put others first and I am determined to.

39343,"My favorite is Opera, but use Firefox at work. I like Opera due to the built in dark mode, vpn, and ad-block and the fact that is relatively lightweight (compared to Chrome). Use Firefox due to being easier to run than Chrome and it is pretty much our standard. Used to use Chrome but it got quite heavy and once I switched, I realized how little I liked the design and feel of the interface. I still have it installed, but don’t really ever use it anymore. Tried Edge but just felt a bit incomplete. That being said, I have not tried the new Chromium version yet. For old stuff (Windows 98SE) I have been using Seamonkey, albeit an older version, because it works. I avoid Internet Explorer and Safari at all costs.",best web browser
