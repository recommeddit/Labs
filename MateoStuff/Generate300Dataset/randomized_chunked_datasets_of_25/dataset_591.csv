67443,axios alternatives reddit,"> adding a 3rd party library for progress updates was something I wanted to avoid...

Yep, totally understand that. If I'm not doing anything that something a library like axios would make easier, native APIs make plenty of sense. Though I guess many of us can be lazy to use more than one approach when we're comfortable with one we've been using for so long, so it's usually a switch or stay choice :\"
49635,best gaming monitor,"Don't forget about resolution and aspect ratio. I was an early bird going for ultrawides back in the day before they were mainstream. I understood the power of watching a movie in 2.35.1 or having the extra immersion when it came to gaming, or that extra space to have two documents side by side. It's well worth going for an ultrawide. Even back in the day when 1080p was new, I went for the 1920x1200 panels instead, the extra vertical space does make a difference when browsing, coding, etc.

Now I would consider nothing less than 3440x1440 if your budget allows it (possibly going for a VA panel as a tradeoff, or 60hz panel if you're not big into gaming). LG makes darn good panels and I can highly recommend them. They are one of two major (panel) manufacturers in the business and have typically great quality control.

The dream is of course 3880x1600  144Hz IPS, (cropped 4k)  the extra vertical space from a 1440 makes all the difference to me. LG has a few of those, but I'm not buying one yet though since I'm waiting for a proper HDR technology to hit the market (the current HDR specifications shouldn't even be considered HDR and are more of a marketing gimick ). Heck if I'm spedning 2k on a monitor it should have 'everything'. So I'm saving up for one hopefully next year. For now my 34"" 3440x1400 offbrand monitor will have to do : )"

55655,best action and adventure novel series,"The only time he is really incoherent to the rest of the story is gridlinked.  I don't think he had fully planned out his universe at that point.

In later books he takes much of the poor/misfitting things and says ""This was actually inaccurate... this is the real thing"" which are poorly disguised attempts to fix the inconsistencies that don't fit with the way the series ended up.

That said I rather prefer that method rather than spending far too much time trying to justify poor plot decisions (think star wars kessel run/ parsecs).  IMO star wars would have been far better off just putting a one liner in some future movie or book saying ""Why is it called parsecs?"" ""Well the guy who made it up was dyslexic and called lightyears parsecs and it became a tradition to call them that in the particular context."" or something along those lines rather than some of the convolution I have seen to try to explain it."

Jim Sarbh, mainly because of his voice. His character in padmavat with that accent was really good."
54239,best medicine for a cold,"2 things:

- i'm completely unsure if this one actually works or if it's just a placebo, but i always do it when i have a cold. I take a capful of hydrogen peroxide and tip my head and put it in my ear, allowing it to bubble out for a bit. It tickles. After a minute or so I tip my head back upright and drain the excess into the sink. I do the other ear. Someone a long time ago told me that it works for their colds, and ever since I started doing this it seems to shorten the length of my sickness. 

- walgreens brand saline spray. If you're blowing your nose a lot, this is a must. It absolutely saves me from having that raw feeling I used to get after blowing my nose a lot."

That's the only one I played for any extended amount of time. I skipped the entire PS2/PS3 generations wrt consoles (saw no point as PES was ported to PC and it was the main reason I needed a console).

Played it at a friends mostly, so I never got really in depth with the game, but would have loved to see it on PC."

33532,best electric car,"Interesting video.

Tesla is for sure holding it's value in terms of performance.

However, the rest of the industry is starting to sink their claws in. The mustang being the first real competition with the Ford Lightning being the next. 

In 5 years Tesla is going to be even or worse most likely. Then they're gonna have to compete with warranty and actual car stuff. 

A lot of less optimal things in a Tesla are still way behind actual car manufacturers. See interiors."
