30149,"In Texas, all students are required to take Texas History in 7th Grade (we don’t take American History until 8th Grade).

Most of our attention went to the Texas Revolution itself, which, obviously, preceded the Mexican-American War.  We were taught that Texas was a Mexican state populated by a lot of Tejanos and American Immigrants.  Mexico required all immigrants to be Catholic.  Most American Immigrants were Protestant, so a Mexican citizen named Stephen F. Austin found a loophole that used the term “Catholic” to mean “Christian” instead of “Roman Catholic,” and a bunch of Americans moved in. Many of them brought their slaves with them.

Then Santa Ana seized power in Mexico City and tore up the Constitution of 1824, which took away a *ton* of civil rights from the people and essentially made himself Dictator-for-Life.  It also had the effect of outlawing slavery.  

So it didn’t matter if you were a Tejano, a slave-owning Tejano, a Roman Catholic, a Protestant, an American Immigrant or an American Immigrant with slaves; they were equally *all* fucked. 

Unsurprisingly, several Mexican states *in addition to* Texas revolted.  Santa Ana brutally suppressed the other rebelling Mexican states first, and then turned northward to Texas. 

Then you had Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto.  Presto-Changeo, Santa Ana traded his life for an Independent Texan Nation. 

But the Texans didn’t *want* to be independent. They wanted to become a part of the United States right from the start.  It’s just that the US was already struggling with the Free-State/Slave-State issue, and a slave-holding Texas complicated things. So the US said, “Naw - don’t call us, we’ll call you.”

About a decade goes by and Santa Ana, very much regretting signing away Texas by now, starts challenging the southern border of the newly-independent nation, claiming that it ended at the Nueces River, instead of the Rio Grande River, about a 100 miles south.  

By this point, the US just happens to have a workable entry plan for several territories, but they needed another slave state to make the deal work. 

So the US calls up Texas: “Yo, I think we can make room for you now.” Texas says: “Ah, I’d love to.  But we got a fuck-ton of debt we weren’t expecting to accumulate, because *someone* wouldn’t let us in their club - *I’m looking at you, Sam!*. We also got that fuckwad from the south threatening to invade us again, and using the border dispute as a *causus belli*. “

US says, “Oh.” 

Texas: “So what are you going to do about *that*?”

US: “I mean, I guess we could invade and...ah, save you from tyranny or something like that.” 

Texas: [Rolls eyes] “*Finally*”

US: “Will it mean that we have to actually *conquer* Mexico, because, we...ah...we *really* don’t wanna do that.” 

Texas: “How the fuck should *I* know? You’re the one with the army.  You tell *me*.”

US: [Sighs]. “Okay.  Some of the guys really aren’t gonna like that.  But...*[checks pending territorial deal]* I guess if we’re going to make this deal work any time soon, I reckon we don’t have much of a choice.”

Texas: “Yeah. Whatever. Just get your ass to Kinney’s Trading Post on the Nueces River.  We’ll meet you there.” *[Hangs up phone].*

US: *[Stares at phone in astonished disgust].* “Fuck.”

US makes a half-assed attempt to resolve the situation diplomatically.  Mexico makes a full-assed attempt to tell the US that they and their deal can fuck right off. 

US shows up in Texas and marches to Mexico City in an effort to end the war. This followed  the by-the-numbers European warfare strategy of “Capture the Capital, End the War.”  

Mexico puts up a fight.  Santa Ana is more effective than people thought, but is still ultimately overwhelmed by superior American numbers, weapons, and training.  

Santa Ana takes off, leaving Mexico with broken coffers and a legacy of socio-political problems;  some of which plague that country to this very day.  

US gets their slave state, and their territory deal finally goes through.  

Less than 20 years later, a bloody civil war begins.
