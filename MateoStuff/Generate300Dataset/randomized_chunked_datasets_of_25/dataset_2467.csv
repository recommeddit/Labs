24557,"My top 10. Each of these shows has impacted me on a deep level in some way, and I hope that you can get something out of knowing my favorites. 

1. A Place Further than the Universe- Yes, I know it just ended yesterday, but I really don't think I can justify it not being my new favorite anime. For a show about girls going to Antarctica, this is infinitely relatable. YoriMoi has some absolutely phenomenal character dynamics, and it explores each of its main characters in-depth and makes them all multi-faceted individuals and intimately close friends. It's messages about not being afraid to take risks, not being complacent, and the importance of friendship resonate hard, and the series somehow makes its formulaic structure feel organic, with each and every episode making me at least tear up (and in some cases completely break).  

2. K-On- Fun things are fun, and when you make that fun build-up to one of the most emotional coming-of-age stories I've ever seen, you get something special. K-On is hilarious, adorable, has great character development, and is infinitely relatable and emotional. It's depth of characterization is nearly unmatched, and the girls feel like real friends, more like family, who remind me way too much of my own close group of friends. I also relate very deeply to Yui's search for motivation and purpose in her new friend group, and Azusa reconciling her feelings of her seniors graduating and leaving her behind, so K-On is exceptionally personal to me. Everything leading up to graduation in the final episode (so about half of season 2) is something I have personally experienced nearly exactly, and it makes everything feel that much more real. On top of that, the school is an exceptionally well-realized setting, and it makes me feel as attached to it as the girls do, and just as sad to leave it behind. I can go on about this show forever, as I've rewatched it no less than 4 (and counting) times and discover something new each and every time. 

3. Aria- Aria's setting is an accomplishment; Neo-Venezia is insanely well realized with surprisingly deep lore and a rich history. But on top of top-tier world-building, Aria's captivating atmosphere and fantastic characters hooked me. It's simple life lessons are applicable to anyone, and it conveys them with heart and emotional depth. As a coming-of-age story, Aria makes me want to treasure the every-day while I still can, before moving to the next stage of my life and leaving it all behind. Plus its filled with great visual comedy and is just as endearing as it is emotionally affecting. 

4. Clannad- Lots has been said about Clannad, but its so much more than just cry-porn. Clannad truly fleshes out its main characters and makes them feel real. Tomoya and Nagisa complete each other as people, and it was easy to get invested in their relationship. The side characters are all a joy, and season 1 gave most of them what they deserve, but as a story about family, and tragedy, After Story is real and raw. This is a show that legitimately changed the way I think, and made me actively change some relationships in my life. This is the series I get the most defensive about (especially in regards to the ending), and that's because of how valuable and expertly-crafted I believe it to be. 

5. Shinsekai Yori- Another show with top-tier world-building, Shinsekai Yori slowly builds up into one of the most impactful and thought-provoking thematic experiences I've ever had. Watching its characters grow from childhood to adulthood and continuously change their views as they learn more about their intriguing world and develop mentally is compelling, and even more-so is the series ""villain"" who is both complex and sympathetic in a way that really calls into question a lot of what I, and the characters, thought we knew. I love the aesthetic as well, and it has some of the most striking shot-composition I've seen (and a great soundtrack to boot). 

6. Fate/Zero- I've always been a fan of anything relating to Greek mythology, so a series styled like a Greek tragedy was inherently appealing to me. Fate/Zero has some of the most compelling characters out there, whose clash of ideals were thought-provoking and made the most out of the Fate-series unique premise. Dark and nihilistic, filled with irony and tragedy as well as hope (and awesome animation and music), this show has some of my favorite scenes in anime, and is just freaking fantastic all around. 

7. Shirobako- As a young adult who has creative ambitions (that I don't think I am going to be able to make work unfortunately), Shirobako's exploration of adults chasing their dreams and making do with not-so-ideal situations they get was personal. As an anime fan, its always interesting to take a look into what makes the industry tick (and some great references), and knowing that creators work in that field, in poor working conditions, out of passion for anime is validating. The series also has a unique, quirky sense of humor that always had me smiling, and the combination of that humor and emotion led to my favorite episode of any anime so far (number 23). 

8. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood- Everything's been said about this one. An epic story, excellent characters with deeply personal stakes, great world-building, interesting themes about Truth/Religion and Faith/Equivalent Exchange/Perseverence, great animation, etc. FMA:B has it all and does it all exceptionally well. 

9. Sound! Euphonium- I dedicated 8 years of my life to band, and my deep attachment to music is captured perfectly in this show. It's a very accurate portrayal of concert band, and the detail put into it is astounding. It also has some of the most nuanced and interesting characters out there. Kumiko is my favorite anime protagonist, with her refreshingly snarky personality and personal story to engage with her passion and the people around her being emotionally resonant. Everyone else is fantastic as well, leading to a very impressive ensemble drama (pun totally intended). Plus it has gorgeous animation and is extremely gay. That last part in particular is kind of important. 

10. March Comes in like a Lion- Rei's portrayal of depression and loneliness is painfully accurate. Someone who wants to be helpful but always feels like he's a burden, someone who wants to be loved but who feels he isn't worthy of love, he is empathetic and hugely relatable. This show is incredible at making all of its characters feel distinctly human (never knew I could feel so much for a man reuniting with his pigeon), and its world feels connected and real. It's also really funny and handles its tone shifts in a way that keeps me in Rei's head, but it can also do an arc about bullying that is frighteningly similar to my own experiences with bullying and pack an insane punch. I am also a huge fan of Shaft's visual style, and it's put to great use here (it isn't too much further down my list where you'll find Madoka and Monogatari). It's a bit inconsistent, but its highs are incredible and the lows are those that most anime would be lucky to reach as a high.",best anime
