11557,best gifts for dad,Hahaha I wish I had thought of that.
1683,best ice cream flavor,Pistachio is amazing
2262,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"""Bakersfield Pizza Co. & Bar"" and ""Slice of Italy"" are both good. Mountain Mike's is also pretty decent."
28928,best breakfast foods,"If you like up and go's you gotta make smoothies.

I use:

- skim milk
- scoop of protein powder (usually strawberry or banana)
- a few slices of frozen banana (peel and slice them before you freeze)
- sometimes other frozen berries

If you have a bullet style blender these take 20 seconds to make and are better than any up and go. The frozen banana is almost like ice cream and turns it into an awesome thickshake

If you want to make it more like an Up and Go try adding a spoon of crushed oats too."
12519,best gifts for mom,"When buying a gift for any one, the way to go about it is to ask this: what do they *desire*, but would never buy them selves?

For example, my mother loves cordial cherries, fucking loves them. But she never buys them for herself, she considers that a unnecessary luxury.

But as a gift, they are perfect: she likes them, it shows that i pay attention to her liking them, and their relatively inexpensive so i can get a fair amount."
58489,best cologne,"Polo Black by Ralph Lauren is very much worth it, it's just a bit costly but I just can't stress enough how good it is. Forget everything else mentioned, get Polo Black, thank me later."
16296,best sunglasses for fashion,"Those *sound like* really good quality, polarized and stainless steel. 

How is the lens hardness and clarity? These are half the price of wayfarers and look just as good, I'm impressed"
24109,best anime,What would you say is good about Legend of Galactic Heroes. I'm just about to start the first of 110 episodes of it and I would like some justification to ease my nerves. (long series commitment issues)
68939,best science fiction novel,Is there a different Hyperion than the one from 1989?
16154,best sunglasses for fashion,"AO can be had for less than 40 bucks. They are nice, for the price."
30151,best Mexican war to study,"Yep.  Slavery was definitely a part of the equation.  But as you point out, it was only *a part* of the impetus to rebel.  It wasn’t even the primary reason, like it was later in the American Civil War. 

Not *every* American Immigrant in Texas owned slaves.  And even fewer Tejanos did.  It was mostly like: “WTF? You’re taking away our right to free speech...*so you can issue your own laws and be President-for-Life?*”

*Anyone* would have rebelled; slaves or no slaves.  

And several Mexican states did.  Unfortunately for some of the rebels on the Yucatán Peninsula, Santa Ana was particularly brutal.  And he intentionally made it painful for them - many of whom were indigenous people.  He wanted to make a statement that he was in charge.  

Texians were rightly terrified about what was going to happen to them when he turned his forces northward.  And as it turns out, they were right about him at the Alamo.

I see on Reddit a lot of people making the mistake in assuming Santa Ana was fighting in Texas to stop slavery.  Maybe.  Maybe a *little* bit; although I haven’t seen any credible evidence for this claim.

Mostly he was there for some serious dick-waving to show Mexico - and the rest of the world - that he had an inescapably iron grip on the throat of his country."
41045,best instrument to play,Haha I was joking
9115,best toothpaste,"My mom always bought sensodyne for the last couple years I lived at home, but I noticed my breath would just start getting awful like halfway through the day and my mouth didn't really feel super clean to begin with. I couldn't do it. I much prefer the stupidly minty, breath-annihilating toothpastes."
24088,best anime,"This is rather hard for me since I enjoy so much anime ;-;

28358,best breakfast foods,Thank you for the link - it looks delicious.
5044,best home improvement store,"Yes! I liked hd as they seem to have better tools but the biggest win is the checkout. I walk up, scan my stuff, pay and leave. At Lowe's they have the slowest lines. The old ladies working the register are nice but soooo slow"
14647,best romantic novel,One of my oldest favourites {Just the way you are by Christina Dodd} and I really love Vanessa Gray Bartal books like her {Won't you be my neighbor by Vanessa  Gray Bartal} and all her characters seem to be exceptionally quirky!
14547,best romantic novel,Ok great! Someone else mentioned Chloe Brown so I’m putting that on my list. I will check out the princess trap as well.
31095,best country to live in,"70 and humid and in the sun is nice though. The problem with air conditioning is you're indoors and it's usually dry, which makes it feel cooler."
