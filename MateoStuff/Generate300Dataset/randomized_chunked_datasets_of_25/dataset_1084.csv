28928,"If you like up and go's you gotta make smoothies.

I use:

- skim milk
- scoop of protein powder (usually strawberry or banana)
- a few slices of frozen banana (peel and slice them before you freeze)
- sometimes other frozen berries

If you have a bullet style blender these take 20 seconds to make and are better than any up and go. The frozen banana is almost like ice cream and turns it into an awesome thickshake

If you want to make it more like an Up and Go try adding a spoon of crushed oats too.",best breakfast foods
12519,"When buying a gift for any one, the way to go about it is to ask this: what do they *desire*, but would never buy them selves?

For example, my mother loves cordial cherries, fucking loves them. But she never buys them for herself, she considers that a unnecessary luxury.

But as a gift, they are perfect: she likes them, it shows that i pay attention to her liking them, and their relatively inexpensive so i can get a fair amount.",best gifts for mom

30151,"Yep.  Slavery was definitely a part of the equation.  But as you point out, it was only *a part* of the impetus to rebel.  It wasn’t even the primary reason, like it was later in the American Civil War. 

Not *every* American Immigrant in Texas owned slaves.  And even fewer Tejanos did.  It was mostly like: “WTF? You’re taking away our right to free speech...*so you can issue your own laws and be President-for-Life?*”

*Anyone* would have rebelled; slaves or no slaves.  

And several Mexican states did.  Unfortunately for some of the rebels on the Yucatán Peninsula, Santa Ana was particularly brutal.  And he intentionally made it painful for them - many of whom were indigenous people.  He wanted to make a statement that he was in charge.  

Texians were rightly terrified about what was going to happen to them when he turned his forces northward.  And as it turns out, they were right about him at the Alamo.

I see on Reddit a lot of people making the mistake in assuming Santa Ana was fighting in Texas to stop slavery.  Maybe.  Maybe a *little* bit; although I haven’t seen any credible evidence for this claim.

Mostly he was there for some serious dick-waving to show Mexico - and the rest of the world - that he had an inescapably iron grip on the throat of his country.",best Mexican war to study
