>It is important to realise that **Request and Response bodies can only be read once**! Both interfaces have a boolean attribute bodyUsed to determine if it is safe to read or not.

>This decision allows easing the transition to an eventual [stream-based](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/) Fetch API.

From [the fetch API introduction blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/this-api-is-so-fetching/), emphasis mine -- it looks like it's the standardize behavior."

38769,best web browser,"Its brave period, and waterfox, and SR Iron. Chrome and edge - uninstall)"
53528,best medicine for a cold,"It's probably a learned behavior on the Dr's part. After having so many patients who nag at him over getting the Rx, he's stopped trying to talk patients out of it and defaults to letting the patient decide for themself. 

Or it could be a prescription kickback.  They prescribe a medication so many times to get an incentive from the pharmaceutical company."
62509,Best RPG game on PS4,"AC Odyssey is a joke. For RPG, try

* Skyrim SE
* Witcher 3
* Persona 5
* Fallout 4
* Divinity Original Sin 2
* Kingdom Come Deliverance
* Greedfall (out in Sept)
* Outer Worlds (out in Oct)"
13181,best gifts for mom,"I'm not big on spas or other stuff, what I wanted was TIME!

My husband did the best thing ever and offered to have a maid service come help for a few months. It's not that expensive if you get the right one (ours visits bi-monthly and it's $60 per visit) Even when I was staying home those first few months it was SO SO SO worth it. Not having to worry about clean toilets and just focus on the kid was the best present he could have ever given me!

Forget the pretty toes, a good night's sleep combined with a maid -- best present ever!"
7622,best laptop for general use,"Congrats mate!! I’m so glad you got your hands on one!

4253,best text editor,Vim is the best editor because it can be spelled in so many incorrect ways that it's like a cornucopia for pedant grammar nazis.

53,best terminal file manager reddit,Better than globs? Strong words. I'm gonna give `mc` a try. Thanks.
68707,best science fiction novel,"I really enjoyed the Quantum Thief series.  It's a bit hard to get your head around at first but that's part of understanding the mystery the main character is facing so you understand that too in retrospect as things progress.

Scalzi's Old Man's War is also quite good.  Redshirts is good but very snarky and third wall."
57876,best cologne,"I consider myself somewhat of a cologne aficionado, here's a list of my favorites

* (1) Issey Miyaki pour homme 
* (2) Very Sexy for Him (Victoria's Secret)
* (3) Gucci by Gucci
* (4) Lacoste pour homme

According to an eager sales guy at Macy's, a lot of my favorite colognes have sandalwood essence in common"

31250,best country to live in,"What? No, Canada actually has fairly competitive tax rates and decent social mobility. 

I'd choose America over Canada if I were wealthy or had a great job, as stated above. It's worth noting that both of these come with fantastic insurance and lower hospital bills. Additionally, if I get severely ill, I would rather live with debt than die on a waiting list - or at least have that option."
65279,best phone service company,i really like your name (ive contacted every stets)
16228,best sunglasses for fashion,If you’re in Canada The Bay has some Alfred Sung polarized glasses for as little as $20. I’ve had a few pairs of the club masters and they are very good for the price.
48316,best color to paint with,"For the ceiling, I just did a basic flat ceiling white from Lowes. 

For my walls, I did Sherwin Williams Aesthetic White. It looks beautiful in satin. Enough contrast from the ceiling with no strong undertone. It trends on the warmer side but mostly will reflect the light coming into the room!"
