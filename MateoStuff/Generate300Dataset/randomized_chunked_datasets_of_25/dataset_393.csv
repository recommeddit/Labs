My husband did the best thing ever and offered to have a maid service come help for a few months. It's not that expensive if you get the right one (ours visits bi-monthly and it's $60 per visit) Even when I was staying home those first few months it was SO SO SO worth it. Not having to worry about clean toilets and just focus on the kid was the best present he could have ever given me!
