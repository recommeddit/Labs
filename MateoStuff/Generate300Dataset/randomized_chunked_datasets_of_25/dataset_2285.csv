Most NFS post 2005 has struggled to attain the quality of 2005 and previous."

73121,best Linux distro,"It runs really well on my laptop. Keeps the fans quiet. A rather minimal install of Arch is faster and snappier, but seems to heat up my laptop and get the fans going. I guess Manjaro comes with some sort of power management already installed, but since I've got no clue as to what exactly, and I'm too lazy to look it up, I just keep using Manjaro.

Since the two things I most value in a laptop is it being quiet and the keyboard being good, I'm all set!"
