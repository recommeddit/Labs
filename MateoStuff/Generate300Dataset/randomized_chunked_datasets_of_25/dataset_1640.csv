I'd seen that guy at a lot of openings and in fact I'd mentally categorized him as ""that guy who looks like Lou Reed"" but I realized, yes it was!  So I told her this.

He'd been walking to the door when we said this and had heard us - and he stopped by the door, turned around, crossed his arms and looked right at us.  The message was clear: ""I'm leaving, so if you wanted to say something, now is the time.""

My girlfriend walked over to him and said, ""I just want to shake your hand.""  He said, ""Put it there,"" and they shook hands and he left.

It was really civilized and I always had a soft spot for him after that.  RIP, Lou.",best celebrity
