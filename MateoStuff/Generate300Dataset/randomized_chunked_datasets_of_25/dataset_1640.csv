26796,best board games,"For real. I think the lightest game on here is TTR. Not unexpected given this sub. Also this sub really hates Catan.

I think the concern I have is someone new to the hobby comes to this sub looking for that next game. Not sure spirit island or war of the ring would be the way to go."

54625,best artisan mousepad alternatives,are there any recent videos/reviews confirming this?

23001,best celebrity,"Many years ago, I was in a gallery with my girlfriend at the time, and she said, ""Isn't that Lou Reed?""

I'd seen that guy at a lot of openings and in fact I'd mentally categorized him as ""that guy who looks like Lou Reed"" but I realized, yes it was!  So I told her this.

He'd been walking to the door when we said this and had heard us - and he stopped by the door, turned around, crossed his arms and looked right at us.  The message was clear: ""I'm leaving, so if you wanted to say something, now is the time.""

My girlfriend walked over to him and said, ""I just want to shake your hand.""  He said, ""Put it there,"" and they shook hands and he left.

It was really civilized and I always had a soft spot for him after that.  RIP, Lou."
