Hmmm. I dont think that true. I've been using HD veteran discount at checkout and I have always gotten it. The only times I've had issues have been on online orders.
I didn't think I'd see this anywhere in this thread!
"An interesting war involving America was the [First Barbary War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War). It's pretty obscure, but also interesting."
I'd love to know where all the drs are that just perscribe stuff to placate their patients. Every Dr I've ever had treats me like a drug addict any time I ask for anything. I asked my last Dr for a B12 shot and she looked and me and said yeah I'm not doing that go take the otc pills.
"Yeah, but you should also take into consideration how long it takes for practice to become ineffective. 40 hours of practicing a week for a year is definitely going to wear you out."
My electric heat pad ($50 Sunbeam “King size” from London Drugs) has changed my life! I use it almost everyday—using it has greatly reduced my back pain and helps me relax in the evenings. It’s part of my daily routine now.
"I think it's because OLED usually uses PWM dimming and it can irritate some people, but his phone can also do DC dimming so we will see if it helps him."

"I have a Doctorate in Nursing Practice.

A few points: 

BSN RNs want to largely exclusively work in hospitals.  This is because the pay is better and clinical experience is more rigorous then Long Term Care/Skilled Nursing Facilities.  There are however a limited amount of jobs in hospitals and those are ones that people tend to stay with.

BSN RNs tend to more frequently to want to jump into competitive units (Peds, ED, ICU, NICU, LDRP).

Nursing schools exist often in places where nurses are needed *the least*.  It may be a ""chicken or the egg"" problem here.  The southwest, south and midwest are in significant need for RNs.

Finally, regardless of your view on PPACA it certainly has made hospitals have to reorganize themselves and their care, which explains current hiring lulls.  Additionally in the grand scheme of PPACA it provides  incentives for people spending *less* time in hospitals, moving RNs roles more outside the hospital.

tl;dr - jobs exist in surplus outside of hospitals and in geographic regions not served by nursing schools."
"$600 is pretty much my absolute max and I’m pushing my budget just a bit ($600 and an additional roughly $50 for tax).

I want to live in Denmark. Hoping to move there after university.
"There are a multitude of reasons I love Terraforming Mars. One that I never hear other people mention is how well it organizes and presents the game state. Most card-based engine builders have a problem where it's hard to see what your opponents are doing. But in TfM, you can see most of what a player is doing by looking at the central board or their production boards. Sometimes you need to look at their tags and their blue cards, but even that is relatively easy to see based on the iconography."
These people are wrong about bold colors. Grey has the most mass appeal now. Like it or hate it greys and whites are in.
"Anything business.

Or really, just anything. American society uses the 4 year degree to discriminate. If you have one, you're in. If you don't, you're out. Throw an internship and a fraternity membership in there and you're freaking golden.

Not to say you can't make a decent living without a degree, but it will be a whole shitload easier with one."

"When less than a 5 gal bucket or whatever: Buy a big empty bucket, dump all the cans of paint in, stir well, and cap the bucket or refill the cans.

When you can't do that, try to use a new can of paint at a corner. When you get to a corner, and you know the can won't last for the next whole wall, open a new can. At some point, pour all the partial cans of paint together and start at the next corner.

Save the paint chip, or make a new one on flat cardstock. Tape it to the can lid so it can be matched years from now.

Saves a lot of headache!"

Tell Me Who I Am was at Telluride last year and was the talk of the festival. I’m surprised it didn’t make a bigger splash with awards.
