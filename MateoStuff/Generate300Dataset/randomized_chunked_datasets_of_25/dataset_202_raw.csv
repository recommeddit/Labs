I am the liquor
"I have the LG 27GL83A which is the same monitor with an sRGB color gamut I think (so no nano-IPS), significantly cheaper and I'm very satisfied with it. Unless you're doing very color-sensitive work with photo/video editing and the like, I would say there's no need to get nano ips."
"A Fire Upon the Deep is on my *tsundoku* shelf, and I'm tempted to read it next. Based on this thread. But I really don't want to know more details about it, to keep it completely novel, hah. I picked it up after AstronomyCast's multiple episode series on more contemporary science fiction they've read and would recommend. [Part One: Space Exploration](http://www.astronomycast.com/2017/12/ep-469-best-modern-sci-fi-for-the-science-lover-part-1-space-exploration/) if anyone is interested. Also highly recommend the podcast itself. 

I *just* finished The Three Body Problem, also per their suggestion.

I have been planning on reading horror next, for ""the season."" Starting with [Uzumaki](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20423941-uzumaki?rating=2&utm_medium=api&utm_source=book_widget)   and then Bradbury's [The October Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_October_Country?wprov=sfla1), but now I'm not sure. Maybe A Fire Upon the Deep will be a good end of November book."
"I read my school's newspaper in class, and by ""read"" i mean ""do the crossword"""
"Excellent world-building, especially in Pandora's Star. But his brand of space opera is too cheesy to compare with heavy hitters like LeGuin and Ishiguro."
"Spider-Man is my favorite super hero of all time. I grew up watching the Raimi films. At that time I loved the films, they were my favorite things to watch as a kid. That being said Tom is my favorite portrayal of Peter and Spider-Man from the live action films."
"My dad, as a Coca-Cola chemist, always gave out varieties of soda, asking kids which one they preferred. He stocked up on every variety. They loved it, and the parents would sometimes even ask for one. When out for that long collecting candy, you get thirsty. Give those costumed kids some bubbly candy-water. As a plus, left-overs make great mixers!"
"O IIdsandsII, IIdsandsII! Wherefore art thou IIdsandsII?
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    And I’ll no longer be a Bagina."
Jameson + Canada Dry = happiness
"Easily an electric bike, if there's one that meets your needs."
"I decided to get my Fiance a tent and camping gear and our daughter wants to make him a bookmark so hopefully I can get a craft kit and make a nice one.

I hope this is a good idea :)

Edit: I will call my Dad up and tell him how much I love him for everything he's taught me and how proud I am to be his daughter."
"Incidentally, I'd go with butter pecan in a dipped waffle cone. Gotta go with the classics."

xps 13 for sure
"The one you like the most.  Personally, I like switching it up on the fly, so I have a Cherry MX clear board and a Gateron board at my disposal.  I have Zealios coming soon which I am very excited to type on."
"Can recommend Fjallräven Kånken. If you have to carry laptop, they have a version for that as well, with a great separate compartment for it. I've had it for 4 years and have zero complaints."
"Mostly PC. But if there are local coop games, I'll play them on playstation."
"If you're looking into Upstate - the Finger Lakes, Saratoga Springs, and Lake George are all really worth it."
"TN is the worst in everything besides response times and price. They're used mostly in cheap gaming monitors since they can achieve high refresh rates at low costs. They tend to have a grey-ish image quality tho because they can't produce decent contrast. 

IPS are your ""good, all around"" monitors, even though their contrast still isn't fantastic (this is a downside of LCDs in general). Their quality though varies a lot. Just because a monitor has an IPS panel, it doesn't mean it's good or has good image quality. 

VA improves a lot on IPS' contrast, but sacrifice viewing angles. For gaming though this isn't a big issue, but it is for office use. They're mostly used in high-end TVs because a good VA panel is basically the best kind of LCD you can buy and they're now coming to the monitor market too but they're hard to find."
"Illmatic > It Was Written

My take."
"You should not do any-end development without learning those languages. Almost all problems with Bootstrap, et al, arise from people not knowing CSS. Just like you wouldn't recommend for people do backend work without *actually learning a backend language*, you shouldn't *recommend* for people to do frontend work without learning a frontend language."
"Little known fact: Pooh bear is actually the reason the honeybees are dying.


What an asshole."
"I have seen Arrival about 6 times now and it gets better with each run. The movie is so perfect, the flow, the music, the pictures, it is like a 2 hour meditation. Even if the movie plot would be absolute shit, it would still be worth watching just due to the cinematogrophy."
"If you like British humor, read Robert Rankin. One of his books, Waiting for Godalming, is about a detective who tries to solve a particular case: God was found murdered. In a dark alley behind a pub. Were he probably tried to get laid again. At least underage Jewish virgins frequent this bar..."
I did dolphin gray from Behr which has these qualities.
