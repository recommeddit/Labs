3287,"Odd. The most common advice I read is “whatever you already have is good enough to start.”. Normally the question is posed as “I want a good x to start, what should I get?”, or “what’s good starting gear for a streamer?”. If you ask for advice on what good starting gear is you’ll get the answer, if you ask “do I need x” the answer is “no, whatever you have is fine until you know you want to invest”",best webcamera
37691,"I’m not good at picking favorites in general, so I’m just going to focus on my least favorites.

Iron Man 3 honestly kinda hurt to sit through at points. There are plenty I liked about it, but it deviated way too much from the other two for me to get into it, and even the parts I liked honestly don’t fit the character super well. Thor the Dark World had a good first act in my opinion, but the rest was just incredibly boring and visually unappealing. The best part was easily Loki, and even then he probably shouldn’t have been there, given how bland and underdeveloped the villains were.",best Marvel movie
28880,"Edit: Guess I should've read the post more before I replied. Hard-boiled eggs are easy to make, cheap, and can be eaten easily while driving. Even a Thomas's English muffin is easy to eat while driving. The store I go to always has BOGO deals and I keep them frozen to make them last longer. I don't eat while driving so I always have a serving of frozen veggies but you could eat fruit like an apple or banana easy while driving. Other than boiling the eggs once a week, and then taking the shell off, there's very little prep involved. If you're looking for something that you can add in to 'spice' it up some, you could get the precooked sausage links and microwave them real quick before you leave if get the precooked bacon which I'm not sure about you but I love cold bacon almost as much as hot bacon.",best breakfast foods

29330,"Out of current gen, I'll go with Switch as it's the one I have and I really like its exclusives, as well as handheld mode, motion control in some games, unique stuff such as Ring Fit Adventure etc. Although to be honest, I'd probably have chosen a PS4 if I didn't have a PC. Xbox One is sadly irrelevant in my area due to MS's lack of support unless you're really willing to jump through some hoops to make it work, but I really like its' controller, and I use one on PC for some games.",best game console
