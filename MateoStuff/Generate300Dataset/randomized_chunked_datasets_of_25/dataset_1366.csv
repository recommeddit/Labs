68139,best science fiction novel,"Far too many to pick from; here are the first five books I spotted on my ""Favorites"" bookshelf:

* Foundation by Isaac Asimov
* Nonstop by Brian Aldiss
* The Dying Earth by Jack Vance"
3287,best webcamera,"Odd. The most common advice I read is “whatever you already have is good enough to start.”. Normally the question is posed as “I want a good x to start, what should I get?”, or “what’s good starting gear for a streamer?”. If you ask for advice on what good starting gear is you’ll get the answer, if you ask “do I need x” the answer is “no, whatever you have is fine until you know you want to invest”"
37691,best Marvel movie,"I’m not good at picking favorites in general, so I’m just going to focus on my least favorites.

Iron Man 3 honestly kinda hurt to sit through at points. There are plenty I liked about it, but it deviated way too much from the other two for me to get into it, and even the parts I liked honestly don’t fit the character super well. Thor the Dark World had a good first act in my opinion, but the rest was just incredibly boring and visually unappealing. The best part was easily Loki, and even then he probably shouldn’t have been there, given how bland and underdeveloped the villains were."
28880,best breakfast foods,"Edit: Guess I should've read the post more before I replied. Hard-boiled eggs are easy to make, cheap, and can be eaten easily while driving. Even a Thomas's English muffin is easy to eat while driving. The store I go to always has BOGO deals and I keep them frozen to make them last longer. I don't eat while driving so I always have a serving of frozen veggies but you could eat fruit like an apple or banana easy while driving. Other than boiling the eggs once a week, and then taking the shell off, there's very little prep involved. If you're looking for something that you can add in to 'spice' it up some, you could get the precooked sausage links and microwave them real quick before you leave if get the precooked bacon which I'm not sure about you but I love cold bacon almost as much as hot bacon."
58007,best cologne,"I did see that, but settled on the 2.0 oz bottle, since that qualified for free shipping by $1 and I use fragrances sparingly so it should last me quite a while anyway."
443,best terminal file manager reddit,"pcmanfm. It's familiar to me, easy to use, easy to use with ssh. I also use mc from time to time whenever I'm terminal heavy."
29330,best game console,"Out of current gen, I'll go with Switch as it's the one I have and I really like its exclusives, as well as handheld mode, motion control in some games, unique stuff such as Ring Fit Adventure etc. Although to be honest, I'd probably have chosen a PS4 if I didn't have a PC. Xbox One is sadly irrelevant in my area due to MS's lack of support unless you're really willing to jump through some hoops to make it work, but I really like its' controller, and I use one on PC for some games."
27848,best breakfast foods,No but I do love that song. Not as much as banana pancakes though. It was my first breakfast when I came to America. :)
33623,best electric car,"Spark ev has active cooling, and no battery issues/degration"
6499,best Netflix documentary,Sorry I thought buzzfeed would be the best way to present my show suggestions. Any other sites that you think would work better?
11632,best gifts for dad,"The most common approach is to just set them to a fixed hyperfocal distance so your own eyes do the actual focusing work, which would make them tolerable to use at medium to long distances for someone with decent eyes.  
  
I've also seen binoculars with a digital rangefinder, but I don't think those are very common among civilians."
58195,best cologne,"Since you have worn fragrances for a living what part of the body is the best place to wear it and how much should someone put on? I always wonder if I put on too much or too little. 

I love Aventis and Mountain water. I have been using Creed for over 15 years."
73856,best matte screen protector for ipad,"I've been drawing on my 9.7 iPad for two years and the screen isn't scratched at all. Thinking of buying the new iPad 12.9 too. I've asked this about a week too and lots of people suggest that you should be fine without the screen protector. But again, we haven't seen the new iPad display so I don't know if it will scratch or not"
40866,best instrument to play,"Kazoo, bitches love kazoos."
18154,best YouTube video,"I almost gave up on this video but I’m glad I made it that far, made the whole thing worth it"
70516,best major to study in college,"dude, this is totally offtopic but that's a tight-ass name.

I'm not in stats or anything but still"

7840,best laptop for general use,"Hello!Whats your opinion about this

68310,best science fiction novel,">  Children of the Sky left me cold, and I'm not sure why.

CotS is pretty much all set up and no payoff. It's not a complete story."
8678,best toothpaste,"If you’re spending $.89 on something that a) you don’t use because it’s gross and b) does longterm damage to your teeth, you’re better off spending $.99 and fixing both problems at once."
