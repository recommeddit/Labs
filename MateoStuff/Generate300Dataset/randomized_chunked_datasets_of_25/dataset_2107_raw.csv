"I know that both of them are based on Debian but when I was looking on posts to find what would suit me , the top 3 where those 3 , that's why I do not think archos , eleos , fedora , zorin etc."
"But a best ""budget workstation"". The 3950x is 700‚Ç¨ here and it does spare you maybe 3-4 minutes per one hour render, that's not that much, whilst the 3700x is 280‚Ç¨ (here) right now. That is less than half of the 3950, but just 90‚Ç¨ more than the 3600x.

So if at all then the 8core is the budget king for designers who require render tasks. A 700  bucks processor is still quite expensive for most freelancer."
"I booked for super cheap through a great website you should check out. Luxurylink.com.  It's not for the super wealthy like it may suggest, but they have AMAZING deals on all inclusive resorts all around the world. You can even bid! Have fun checking it out!"
"Can concur, if you have done Gadv already and there is nothing new, it's not worth the ride. So much better coasters being built everywhere else. Gadv needs a RMC bad :("

"Well, there's been a couple of submissions so far, but I would like to point out my subreddit [r/LaymanJournals](http://www.reddit.com/r/laymanjournals). It's intended more for generally accessible content, whereas r/Scientific might be more specialized, but I am vain and jealous and want to give one of my children some due respect. And if you want to put it on the sidebar, I wouldn't mind :)"
Nah I‚Äôve been. I just find there‚Äôs better cities in the country for food than New Orleans.
The Oregon Coast.
Time response is a meme.
It is also pretty easy to learn the basics of.  It doesn't cost much and it fits in your pocket.
"An anecdote from Germany:

Here research and teaching is somewhat separated, with Universities being mainly for teaching students and other institutions doing the main part of actual innovation. So Universities in Germany are at a disadvantage when listed in such rankings. Even though they might be better suited for many students, because teaching is more important for those Universities than pumping out papers."
Being so passionate about history this truth makes me so sad :(
Check out [*DIVA! DIVA! DIVA!* by Paris Michael](https://open.spotify.com/album/5aptbOFtUwbNPMWO0jroNR?si=m29TPEuKSy2qjXT8enD8GQ) if you like Travis Scott and/or Yeezus. It's a dumb comparison but it's quite a bit better than the other Paris-related album I've seen recommended a few times in this thread.
"Sex education. Santa Clarita diet. How to Sell drugs fast online (haven‚Äôt watched second season yet!)

"Soda Dungeon - All of the IAPs, including no advertising, can be earned and bought through gameplay.  The premium currency doesn't need to be bought either as you can earn it just from playing too.  You can play this RPG as either an idle game by using auto combat or a turn-based RPG.  The sequel comes out in a few months.

.Decluser Zero - Vertical top scrolling bullet hell shooter.  Pretty much anything by this game's developer is worth considering.

Pixel Puzzle Collection - Picross puzzle game where the solutions are characters, power ups, bosses and other things from various Konami games.  Although of the games featured, I have played Parodius a lot and not so much the others, I've found this very enjoyable.

Cube Escape - is a series of room escape games that are related to the Rusty Lake games.

Armory & Machine - one of the best totally free incremental/idle games.

Costume Quest - my favorite free RPG.  The one not downside is that you cannot upgraded past iOS 10.  If you have an older device or one you're just not upgrading the iOS any further, make sure that you install the free add-on IAP or you won't have sound effects."
The murderer?
