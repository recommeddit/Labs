16958,best iOS game,"The good news is it's really not an either or. In the case of the iPad, you can have your cake and it eat too with controllers."
63009,Best online React course,"I agree. He does a great job of breaking things down, and giving you examples of applied concepts. $10 a course isn't bad either."
15738,best sunglasses for fashion,[HUGO BOSS](https://www.misterspex.de/sonnenbrillen/boss-boss-0595s-5ts-y1_f6520666.html)
8912,best toothpaste,which toothpaste you use doesnt matter very much.  as long as it has fluoride.  i'd probably stick with one of the bigger brands though.  their products have a long documented history of effectiveness. happy cake day!
32521,best vacation resort,http://xkcd.com/1314/
3425,best webcamera,It all depends on you and your community. Are they satisfied ? Do you think they will appreciate the change ? Is it financially viable for you ?

24147,best anime,"FMA was one of the first anime shows I watched and I still like it having watched a lot of others. It does have its characters go through dark times and deals with serious themes, but it doesn't wallow in depression and the characters respond to events decisively. I prefer Brotherhood; I think it's the more serious of the two, but not by much."
25303,best spiderman actor,Maquire was a great Peter Parker and a bad Spider-Man. Garfield was the opposite. Holland is great at both.
1431,best ice cream flavor,"First mention of cherry garcia is way too far down, insanity!"
17124,best iOS game,"It's a lot like the first game. Just like the first, I found it really fun for an afternoon and then never went back to it."
69665,best major to study in college,As a Christian in a denomination that values education: I now refuse to attend churches where the head leadership people don't have at least a bachelors. I grew up in churches full of uneducated people in positions of power. It's as ugly as you'd expect it to be.
41076,best instrument to play,"I am 25, have played drums since I was 9, guitar since 13, piano since 14, violin since 18 and saxophone since 22 and have reached proficiency in all of them to the point that I have performed and recorded all of them professionally (i.e. in exchange for $$$) and the easiest to reach a standard of playing worth performing on its own was saxophone, followed by piano, drums, guitar and violin. In terms of reaching a technical level sufficient to perform respectably in a group the list is probably guitar, piano, drums, saxophone, violin."
65376,best phone service company,"I’ve been with Verizon since like 2007. I have no issues, Midwest MN. My cousin has T-Mobile and it’s horrible here. 1-2 bars most times."
28558,best breakfast foods,"In my house we just discovered that throwing a handful of spinach in the same smoothies we've been making doesn't change the taste at all and now I have a full serving of veggies (maybe even 2, I keep increasing the amount) with my breakfast without sacrificing flavor."
35831,best alcoholic drink,Vodka Sprites. Can put garbage vodka and still tastes fine. Goes down like water.

60767,Best comedy show on Netflix,Thank u.
16188,best sunglasses for fashion,I agree.  I’ll always take my Seiko SNN079P2 over the Triwa.  But the Triwa is just stunning (from a fashion standpoint) and never fails to get me compliments.
35669,best alcoholic drink,I usually drink the neck of the Corona so I have more room for Bacardi Limon.
72973,best Linux distro,"I'm pretty sure they don't even have that much legit clicks every day, every month, every year. There must be bots involved or some shady business done under the table. 

Imagine Redstar OS being #1 on their list, would you still think it's legit?

Let me guess... https://mxlinux.org/donate/"
