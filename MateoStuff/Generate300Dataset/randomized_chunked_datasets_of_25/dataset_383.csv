41988,movies like Inception,"I mean... the movie trashed the book; which is perhaps one of the greatest pieces of sci-fi ever written. The sequel “Speaker for the Dead” is another contender 

It’s a fast/easy read; or 8 hours book on tape. Give it a go you have some time"
28866,best breakfast foods,nothing wrong with one meal a day? I am pretty sure metabolism largely disagrees.
20787,best workout music,Rocky soundtrack. Been in my playlist since middle school. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SUzcDUERLo
60366,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I’ve watched that, classic comedy and luckily it is on the South African Netflix. TY :)"
6067,best Netflix documentary,currently watching.
36642,best alcoholic drink,"I was so into the White Claw that it became my nickname with the local liquor store owner, but I'm ashamed to say I'm now super into the Svedka ones.  They're *obscenely good.*"
12114,best gifts for dad,SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS AREN'T GOING TO BE SINGLE FOR LONG!
1701,best ice cream flavor,Butter pecan or coffee
9623,best dorm hall at UCSB,I lived in San Nic 4 years ago and I can't imagine them stuffing three people in there. That's just inhumane!
62906,Best Data Science textbook,Practical Statistics is absolutely worth the ~$14 for interview prep.
54945,best water filter,"There is no difference between ""coagulant"" and ""flocculant"". Flocculation is the agglomeration of particles facilitated by mixing, which causes collisions producing enough energy to overcome the repulsive force between two like-charged particles. This is why the closer to the zero-charge point the easier it is to form large flocs (which are not always desirable--such as in dissolved air flotation water treatment plants). Could go on and on about this topic however and if you really need to know more, it's time to pick up Theory and Practice of Water and Wastewater Treatment (Droste, 1997)."
8801,best toothpaste,"Hygienist here. Honestly, manual or electric both are fine. The thing that is important is brushing technique. Also, soft bristles. Also, changing your gross, old, bacteria infested toothbrush heads. I like using a sonicare because it has a two minute timer built in and the colored bristles fade to white as they wear out so you know to replace them. They’re expensive though, a manual works just as well."
55808,best action and adventure movie,"If you like animated stuff, *Castle in the Sky* is a really fun adventure movie. Calling it simplistic feels like a criticism when I don't mean it that way at all, but the plot doesn't get in the way of the action on the screen. I feel like it's one of the more overlooked Miyazaki movies. *Porco Rosso* also falls into that sort of light hearted adventure niche and has probably my favorite English dub.

*Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* is another good one to watch if you're looking for something more plot heavy. There's a lot going on in that one."
54215,best medicine for a cold,"Depending on the severity of the cold working out helps.  If it is a chest cold though forget that get better.  Eating food/more food than normal evening though I don't feel like it.  The body is in overdrive/repair mode and working out and eating plenty of food helps tremendously with recovery.  The obvious ones, drink plenty of water, sleep more, mucinex or good old pseudoephedrine."
10504,best suitcase lock,"Ahh gotcha, thanks.

Any you would recommend?"
28309,best breakfast foods,"Huevos Rancheros and cold brew coffee.  Everything is made beforehand, so if you have time to fry a couple eggs, you can make Huevos Rancheros."
31183,best country to live in,"As a European with roughly the same requirements as OP, I had previously ruled out the US based on healthcare"
10275,best suitcase lock,And the TSA would routinely break those locks if they're not TSA-approved.
25684,best cricket teams of all time,The SA team with Smith Kallis Steyn AB et al may not beat the WI/Aus sides but they sure as hell would salvage some epic draws
35498,best alcoholic drink,"Try it with Sailor Jerry. Add a dash of bitters and a squeeze of lime juice. Throw in a couple pineapple chunks. For bonus points, freeze pineapple before hand and use instead of ice. For an extra heart container, cut the pineapple chunks into triangles before you freeze them, and put three into the drink. You've got the triforce floating there.

I call it The Song of Storms.

Edit: better without this."

56508,best desktop monitor,"Really noticable, 75Hz is usable w/ very minor flicker but 60Hz flickers like hell."
39441,best web browser,I guess if I cared. I guess I'll use something different if I ever needed to access the dark web or anything nefarious.
54947,best water filter,"Typically systems will use coagulant aide (which is really just a different type of coagulant) during periods where for whatever reason the main coagulant in not working effectively, usually due to cold water conditions for a coagulant like alum. Chemically, these coagulants have longer chains of molecules (polymers) which are effective at removing particles, but residual polymer in the water after clarification will cause the filter to be clogged faster and backwashing will have to be done more often. So in terms of cost its a tradeoff. This is why your company only uses this product as an ""aide"" to coagulation as opposed to only using polymer all time time. Plus, the chemical itself can be more expensive."
60101,best perfume,I love Sand And Sable and Trisha Yearwood
