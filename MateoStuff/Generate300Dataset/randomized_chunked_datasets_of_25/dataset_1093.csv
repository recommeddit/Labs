38599,best newspapers to read,"Mint for business news, Hindu for regional/national news and TOI for finding out what sales are going on in my city. Also TOI pays for itself in raddi weight, so that's not an issue.

Firstpost , Ibnlive , NDTV and a couple more for online news and for the reader comments.
PS, Of late have started hating The Hindu, TOI has always been hated. Every business newspaper - Namely Mint, ET and Business Standard seem to be fair, but then they cover only limited aspects of politics and governance."

I will definitely grab one or more papers at a newsstand when I move to see how those are though."
6464,best Netflix documentary,"The Imposter was INSANE.  Exit Through The Gift Shop was a total mind fuck, it almost felt like you were being pranked.  Into The Abyss was surreal, Werner Herzhog (director) is a master of re-creating harrowing tales.  If you dug Into the Abyss check out Grizzly Man, it was actually really good."

4994,best home improvement store,"I agree. Lowe’s is great for faucets, lighting, doorknobs, etc. More displays, broader products, and the like. 

HD is better for when I’m actually building stuff, framing, roofing, etc.

In the pandemic world, however, I feel safer at Lowe’s, given their cleaning protocols, although their huge in-store only sale a week or so into this seemed a little ignorant of the moment’s severity."
5025,best home improvement store,"I always find myself leaving Lowe's and going to HD because our Lowe's is run and operated by idiots, who don't know how to do their work,  constantly screw up, and also don't care about a customer a single bit."
