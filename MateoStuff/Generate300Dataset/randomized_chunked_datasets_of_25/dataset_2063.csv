4152,best online college,"I finished up my degree at WGU this last week. Bachelors of Science, IT-Security. I have degrees from WGU AND a brick and mortar school. I can tell you several things, I learned more at WGU and felt significantly more accomplished at WGU because I didn't have my hand held. I have 10 different IT certifications and now work as a Security Officer. Not only has my degree never been questioned in interviews, it has actually been praised. Many of the smartest IT folks that I've worked with have WGU degrees. In fact that is where I got the idea to even look at WGU originally.   


Brick and mortar schools serve a purpose but they simply cannot stack up to the flexibility of WGU (did I mention I've been military for the lat 15 years as well?). You will pay more at a brick and mortar school, the certifications will not be part of your curriculum, and you will have less flexibility. WGU has the same accreditation as the University of Oregon and tons of others. I see users in here mentioning competition between you and another person, but you have a degree from an online school and they have one from a brick and mortar school, then say it is favorable for the non-online school. This is a made up scenario that doesn't happen, which is laughable. Why? Because WGU you do not get your hand held at all, you do all the work yourself. If any interviewer is worth their salt, they will know what goes into the more well-known school programs.    


TLDR: There isn't a wrong answer, just that the answer is going to different depending on what is right for you! Many people in here spewing what-if scenarios that don't happen in reality."
