33909,best Pokemon game,"I second black/white. I kind of consider them the pinnacle of the series given how much they're able to accomplish and how well-rounded they are. Great story, music, region, etc. It's also pretty technologically impressive for a DS game, especially after the rather basic 4th gen games (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, HeartGold/SoulSilver). All the pokemon sprites are fully animated which blew me away at the time.

Another thing is that these games (and their sequels) were the last Pokemon games with the ""old"" design philosophy where Game Freak added in a ton of extra stuff so that there was something for everyone. This amounts to everything from little minigame-based distractions to larger and more detailed areas with plenty of places to explore. Recently they have decided to just focus on taking the things that the majority of players will be doing, and just polishing them to an extreme. Sun and Moon suffer greatly from this as they feel lacking in depth even if the basic systems are very smooth.

So yeah, Black and White are great. The sequels, Black 2 and White 2 are awesome as well since they add a couple new cities and areas, and unlike most other pokemon ""sequel"" games, they actually continue the story from the previous ones so it's an entirely different experience."

72835,best Linux distro,"> However, in practice many people quit because it's too hard.
