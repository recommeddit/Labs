58970,"I’m going to try my hand at this. I’m a woman in my early 20s. This list is also in no order, and it’s all over the place since I’m really indecisive! I also own mostly sample sizes and small decants. I’ve also only got 9 to put on the list so appologies! 

1) Tocca Stella by Tocca - this was my perfume throughout high school and there’s something wonderfully nostalgic in the oranges

2) Elie Saab Le perfume - started wearing this the last year and the faint honey note is my favourite 

3) Hermès Un Jardin en Méditerranée - makes me feel like I’m at a river at the edge of a forest on the hottest day of summer 

4) Afnan Souvenir Floral Bouquet - nothing else I buy smells like this. It’s underrated and unique. 

5) Amouage Epic - in the best way possible smells like homemade tea blends 

6) Tom Ford Black Orchid - I used to wear this to bars back when they were open, it’s so smooth and dark and I think sensational. 

7) Aqua Allegoria Nettare di Sole by Guerlain - it just smells like outside, or like warm and pleasant 

8) Sì by Giorgio Armani - it’s pleasant and simple, I wear this to work most days. 

9) Fleur de Portofino by Tom Ford - flowery, possibly my favourite scent. A gift from an ex boyfriend so I don’t wear as often, but it makes me think of being outside at a flower garden",best perfume

I've included the public school Top 10 plus all the public schools from the five most populous states (CA, TX, FL, NY, PA.)

Takeaways:  

* CA has 6 out of the Top 11 in the public school rankings.
* SDSU and Fresno State managed to get ranked in the National Universities rankings despite being CSU campuses.  The other 21 Cal State campuses, including Cal Poly SLO, are in the Regional Universities (West) rankings with the exception of Cal Maritime, which is listed in the Regional Colleges (West) category.
* With UC Merced rising to a tie for 44th place among public schools, the 9 UC campuses with undergraduate populations now all boast a ranking better than or equal to the best public schools in 25 US states.",best college in california
