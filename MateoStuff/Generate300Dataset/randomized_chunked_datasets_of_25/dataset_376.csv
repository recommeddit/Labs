9640,"Current RA here. Here's brief rundown for next year. I'll separate it by area:

***San Cat***: Made up of two towers, south and north. Each tower is 8 or 9 stories. There will be construction, and no parking; but all the rooms are going to be doubles, which is cool. I lived there my first year and loved it. Portola is the best, don't believe the lies. You'll end up biking a lot or bussing a lot if you live here. The bike ride isn't that bad, and it keeps you fit. The rooms are suite style, so you'll have a two rooms connected by a bathroom. And given that it's only 2 people to a room, sharing a bathroom with 4 people is super chill. 


***Chi 5***: Only Freshmen live here and it's made up of 5 residence halls. Majoriy of the rooms will be triples. You'll probably eat at DLG or Ortega a lot. I dig Ortega, DLG is whatevs. 

* **Anacapa**: Shaped like a swastika, divided in the middle. Currently one side houses the scholar floor upstairs which is divided in the center by gender. The lower floor is non themed, separated by gender similarly. The other side houses the API (Asian and Pacific Islander) floor upstairs, and the lower floor is non themed. These are both separated by gender in the middle too. The gender separation is pretty much negligible though, as you're all technically on the same floor anyway, just different sides. Each floor has two bathrooms, a male one on the male side and a female one on the female side. 

* **Santa Cruz**: Probably similar to Anacapa, with different themed floors. Bathrooms similar to Anacapa I think. 

* **Santa Rosa**: Shaped like a really long snake. No gender separation. Has some themed floors, not sure which ones. Bathroom situation similar to Anacapa. 

* **San Nic**: Houses the students from the Freshman Summer Start Program(FSSP). Unless you do FSSP, I would recommend *not* choosing this as a top choice because (1) it will be hard to get because it will be mostly full already, and (2) everyone in San Nic will have already formed their friend groups if you do get put there.

* **San Miguel**: Tbh, I don't know too much about San Miguel. Sounds like the floors are single gender, which I think is less fun. I do know that there are more single rooms here though. So if you *really* want a single room, you can try to get put here. 

***Far Side***: This area mainly houses second and third year students, but some freshmen do live here. You'll eat at Carillo a lot, it's cool at first (brick pizza oven, pasta a lot) but I got tired of it fast. It's v carby, ""pizza, pasta, and potatoes"" is how my friends and I would describe it. Though I think a lot of first years in the Chi 5 tend to like it. 

* **Manzanita**: This is a ""village"" composed of 17 different houses. Some of the houses have themes, such as the Continuing Scholars House . Some are non themed. If you get a top floor room the ceilings are p high, which is [neat] (https://i.imgur.com/ZkYogmc.jpg). Single bathrooms, of which there are like 4 or 5 on each floor.  

* **San Raf**: I'm actually not sure if any freshmen live here at all...But I'll give the information anyway. It's made up of a tower and 2 clusters. A lot of it is suite style, so you'll have like a living room, bathroom, and several rooms in one suite. It's pretty cool  if you have a group of friends to live with. 

I personally think San Cat is the best choice. I loved living there and made so many friends. Portola is bomb dot com. The construction will be kinda lame, but I think current residents have said it's not that bad. 

Regardless of where you get put though, you'll have a good time if you make the most of it. I'm sure if I had lived anywhere else my first year, I'd be recommending that res hall to you. So go where you think you'll like the best. Also consider applying for a themed floor (formally known as LLC's or Living Learning Communities). They're nice because you'll be living with people who already have a similar interest, and so it will be that much easier making friends!

EDIT: Yes, I am part of the minority opinion that Portola is good. But when they're on, they're ON.",best dorm hall at UCSB
