Although Cyteen (or something else by Cherryh or Bujold) probably replaces Dune.  I liked Dune when I was younger, but not as much these days."

Just this week two of my friends thanked me for getting them to read Get a Life, Chloe Brown. I also think I’ve run out of people to suggest RWRB to, I am obsessed.

48199,best color to paint with,"Poster boards can be moved around a room, into different light, and tried against trim, ceiling, fabrics, etc.

Painting the wall means that the existing colour will alter the appearance of the new colour, unless you prime it first (or unless the existing wall is pure white?). Additionally, each layer of paint changes the texture of the wall, so the patches may be noticeable as a raised, probably smoother, area of the wall after the room is completely repainted.

Our walls have the knockdown texture (orange peel) and we primed and painted patches to test colour... bit of a mistake, as we tried single and double coats. Then reprimed everything and repainted in the new colour. The patches now have 4-6 layers of paint on them, or 2-4 more layers than the surrounding area. 

Fortunately, we are not so tightly wound that this is bothering us...

51512,best iphone case,"Currently Using *(12 Pro)*: Apple Silicon

Used Previously *(11 Pro)*: Apple Clear, Mous Clarity, 15:21 Cork

**Opinion:** I'd absolutely recommend the Mous Clarity and the 15:21 case to anyone.  For OP specifically, the Mous will offer you protection and visible iPhone color.  It has contoured bezels near the middle to make handling better(won't feel so big in hand).

**Mous Clarity**  
*5/5 Protection*  
[https://www.mous.co/products/clear-iphone-12-pro-max-case?variant=31968508510266](https://www.mous.co/products/clear-iphone-12-pro-max-case?variant=31968508510266)

**15:21**  
*1/5 Protection*  
[https://1521store.com/collections/retail](https://1521store.com/collections/retail)

I used this case for approximately one year on my 11 Pro.  I dropped it numerous times with no issues.  From my own experience,  I think the asking price is 100% worth it.  The case feels well made, easy to handle without feeling like a bar of soap.

Good luck, OP!  Let me know what you think :)"
46879,best hand santizer brand,"Most hand sanitizers use alcohol, which kills indiscriminately.  It would kill us if we didn't have livers to filter it, and in high enough doses will kill anyway.  Some germs survive due to randomly being out of contact, in nooks and crannies and such, not due to any mechanism that might be selected for."
33701,best electric car,"They're the future of passenger cars. For me it comes down to how my car was made with two main goals of having more than 200 miles of range and a battery that can be quick-charged for road trips. Well, a battery that can charge quick also *discharges* quick so they throw on a powerful motor to handle the discharge and I get 0-60 in 5.1s when all I really wanted was something dramatically more efficient than a 30mpg compact. To compete on efficiency an ICE with that kind of acceleration needs to do all sorts of complicated things that amount to *not* using the engine: shut off during decel and idle, shut off extra cylendars, *augment the powertrain with an electric motor*. With an EV the more efficient you make it the better it gets. With an ICE you have to make it more complicated and sometimes less powerful to get efficiency. All the future potential is heavily weighted toward EV.

They will take getting used to and a change of habit but overall my life is far better in an EV than an ICE especially as I'm rural with a longer commute. No more extra stop for gas 2-3x a week as a full charge every morning from home is plenty of range.

Even on this sub I've seen enthusiasts say ""I can see getting one for commuting but I'll keep my ICE sports car for weekends."" Well, that already admits that EVs will be the *dominant* car for transportation. If ICEs become just your weekend toy the industry as a whole will no longer be able to rely on ICE sales and the switch to EV will be on."

38653,best newspapers to read,"It's funny that anything but capitalism, which has been around for less than a blink of the eye in terms of the whole of human history and which, during its reign, has resulted in more global deaths and destruction than any other political philosophy or ""method of production"", is ""outlying nonsense"" to you...  For sure, it has doubtless brought a hell of a lot of fantastic development and wealth with it too - especially if you allow capitalism to claim the gains wrought by energy and technology, which is dubious at best; and extra especially gains for a very small elite - but then even Marx recognised that!

Edit: tided up and made it read a bit less shittily."
