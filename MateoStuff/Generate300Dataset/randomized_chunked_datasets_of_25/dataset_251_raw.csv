"Ayy, same here. I should head over to my local linking police station and apply!"
Unsolved mysteries
"Yeah it's definitely worth a look, I had it on Ps3 years ago and bought the remastered version for PS4 last week, added a few graphic mods and its great. It does feel somewhat dated in most areas but it's just the exploring and making your own story what makes it great. If you enjoyed Oblivion you should give it a go it's fairly cheap these days."

"Hey, can you link them for me?"
"NetX/(Payout min)

NetX means they pay you X days after the end of the months that you reach the minimum.  For instance, if you break $100 in September, you would be paid early December. 
I used to get emails about adult ads, but haven’t in a long time.  I remember having to explicitly disable them with a few networks."
"Also, be able to remember everyone's name and at least one thing about them.  If you see someone once, then a year later remember their name and that their grandmother had been in the hospital, that person will vote for you."

"Murder in the First on Hulu with Kathleen Robertson and Tyne Daly. I really liked it because a case wasn’t solved in one epi, but lasted the whole season. I’d never heard of it before I ran across it on Hulu, but I really enjoyed it."
"well how has no one mentioned *moon,* this is reddit, isn't it?"
"If you receive, say, a masters degree online from Duke, would it be the same as taking traditional on-campus courses? You could still just put M.A. in Underwater Basket Weaving on your resume, right?"

"I’m confused, genuine question: what would you say is the twist in The Truman Show? I feel like the concept of where he’s at and what’s going on is laid out pretty direct from the beginning. But I haven’t seen it in a while."

See what you want to do.  I wouldn't go more northern than New York during the winter.   I haven't don it but some like Harper's Ferry and I would go south from there.   I would do section hikes."
