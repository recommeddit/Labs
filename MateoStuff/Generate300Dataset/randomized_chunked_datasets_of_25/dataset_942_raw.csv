"Dear Zachary.

Just watch the movie and you'll see."
"Yup. That's the thread. You did something that less than 1% of pitchers have ever done. Congratulations dude, best gift ever."

"Idk what really defines sci fi entirely but id like to think a top three personally would be some pretty significant titles. They all are more or less focused on war and humanity but id say *The Forever war, Starship Troopers,* as well as *I-Robot* would be significant additions to any list. Aside from that some guilty pleasures of mine are The ender books both main story and the shadow spin offs and this awesome pick up of *Terms of Enlistment*"

"I suppose it's a bit vague

> UEFA regarded it as the second most prestigious competition, behind the European Cup (later the UEFA Champions League) and ahead of the Fairs Cup (later the UEFA Cup). Therefore, a team qualified for both the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup would play in the European Cup, whereas a team qualified for both the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup would play in the Cup Winners' Cup. Nevertheless, many commentators and fans regarded the Cup Winners' Cup as weaker than the UEFA Cup, which had more and better teams from the stronger European leagues."
"That makes sense. It's weird because I originally thought Endgame was better than Infinity War upon initial viewing. I've already said in this thread, but the movie going experience was far superior for Endgame, but then when I re-examined both movies during the holiday, i just felt that everything Endgame did, Infinity War did better. Guess I'm the minority amongst this group."
I guess I'd call it innocent. It's a British comedy that made fun of science fiction tropes and it started in the late 80's on a non-existent budget. It's relies heavily on the few characters in the show for its comedy. It can be clever but it's also consistently very silly in a way that I only see in British comedy. It never takes itself seriously and I love it for that.
A slow cooker.
I’d actually love to see them take the exact form factor of the SE and make it an all-screen LED display. That would be basically the ideal tiny phone imo
"Lol, `redux` unfortunately is dying.  I'm not saying people aren't still using but many people are realizing just how easy hooks are to use and replicate a store.  
A lot of companies now are indeed migrating to hooks for the sole reason that they don't want to reject new talent that might not be familiar with older conventions but can achieve the exact same results faster with newer features."
