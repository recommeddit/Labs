24242,"I definitely agree with your definition. But I am not arguing for any particular anime to be ranked higher, but just that if the list was written when the anime haven't even air, it obviously won't even appear in said list and will be ranked lower in the overall rankings. Like Demon Slayer won't even appear on your overall ranking because 90% of the lists were written before it aired.

tldr : Somehow you need to give the late 2010s animes a fighting chance. If you're doing this again, maybe consider add more recent (post-2015) list in your compilation?",best anime

29562,"Let's just say Disgaea is a grid-based strategy RPG that is competely OTT in almost every aspect. It can be both challenging and hilarious. Just look at the trailer for Disgaea 4 (Which imo is the most entertaining trailer I've ever seen.)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soH8jG_gfGQ (Skip to ~1min in for the main part of the trailer. the first minute is somewhat of a piss-take on most RPG trailers.)

As for N&B, Nostalgia and the franchise don't affect me as I've never owned an N64. Yet I really like the mechanics and non-serious nature of N&B. I can see why BK fans would be upset though as Microsoft did kind of force a completely different game into the main franchise of it and not a spinoff.",best game console

The main networks I've found effective for these two metrix are:

For Rewarded Video:

For Interstitial Ads:

67365,"Some of the things people say here to justify adding another package to the package hell is not relatable to me.

Retries, timeouts, interceptors are all just 40-50 lines of code on top of fetch with a wrapper function. Yes, reinventing the wheel and all but I would rather keep it simple and add things I need rather than bolt on yet another package.

Or my apps have been not that complex to require packages like these and I can understand use cases like that.",axios alternatives reddit

28938,"If you don't mind meal prep, breakfast burritos have saved my life.  I prep a dozen on one weekend, freeze, then eat one a day for two weeks. I use eggs, potato, salsa and cheese... 

My tips: cook the salsa with the eggs (I use 12), let cool COMPLETELY! I chop my potatoes, sprinkle with season salt, bake until kind of crispy,  let cool COMPLETELY! Put egg mixture, potatoes, and cheese on a tortilla, freeze, and I'm two minutes from breakfast for two weeks. And I can/do eat in car, unlike oatmeal or casseroles for me. Wrap in a paper towel, nuke for two minutes, remember to grab from micro on way out (hardest part for me), and have a filling, convenient, not awful for you, cheap breakfast. 

I get the ingredients at Sam's... I think it's about $5/batch. ($1.40 for eggs, $1.50 for tortillas, $1.30 for cheese, some trivial cost for salsa). You have to spend more for up front costs, though, since you can only get two dozen tortillas, three dozen eggs, a bag of cheese the size of Manhattan, etc, so you'll spend like $20 to get the starter set.",best breakfast foods
