16048,"My husband and I share the following Ray Bans we've acquired over the past 10 or so years:

- Clubmasters: these are my favorite in terms of shape and the fact that they don't hit my cheeks when I smile but they are so heavy and they leave marks on my nose

- Erikas: I like how these are lightweight and comfortable

- Old Wayfarers: I like the shape of these too but they are loose on me (they might have stretched out over the years) and slide off my face

- New Wayfarers: We got these in the rubber matte and it does not age very well. They look gross and peel-y now :(

I also just got the Madewell Indio sunglasses and I really like them! They look like these Oliver Peoples sunglasses I liked at a fraction of the price.",best sunglasses for fashion

47780,"Get just a simple Casio fx-82 II or similar. You don't want an over reliance on a calculator. When I was in HS we had such a reliance on the graphing calculators that I learnt nothing. I went on to fix my mathematical education a few years later to go into uni and I see all the engineering students in my first year mathematics classes not knowing wtf they're doing because they have come straight out of HS with that calculator reliance. If you ever need to really use graphing tools and paper and pen won't cut it, go for symbol lab or desmos.

Good luck",best graphing calculator for vector calculus
