16048,best sunglasses for fashion,"My husband and I share the following Ray Bans we've acquired over the past 10 or so years:

- Clubmasters: these are my favorite in terms of shape and the fact that they don't hit my cheeks when I smile but they are so heavy and they leave marks on my nose

- Erikas: I like how these are lightweight and comfortable

- Old Wayfarers: I like the shape of these too but they are loose on me (they might have stretched out over the years) and slide off my face

- New Wayfarers: We got these in the rubber matte and it does not age very well. They look gross and peel-y now :(

I also just got the Madewell Indio sunglasses and I really like them! They look like these Oliver Peoples sunglasses I liked at a fraction of the price."

47780,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Get just a simple Casio fx-82 II or similar. You don't want an over reliance on a calculator. When I was in HS we had such a reliance on the graphing calculators that I learnt nothing. I went on to fix my mathematical education a few years later to go into uni and I see all the engineering students in my first year mathematics classes not knowing wtf they're doing because they have come straight out of HS with that calculator reliance. If you ever need to really use graphing tools and paper and pen won't cut it, go for symbol lab or desmos.

Good luck"
66761,best soccer team in the world,Idk if that’s true considering we ( a non PL team) just paid 40 mil for Tammy and he’s been great so far
3428,best webcamera,"100% agree ... And to add if you keep debating on a webcam or asking ""do I need a webcam to stream"" the answer is No.... When you first start out the most valuable thing is to just stream... It gets you practice and it gives you a way to download your vod to ""create highlight reels or clips"" to post to other platforms to help discoverability"
3026,best webcamera,"People tend to use DSLR to refer to all ILCs.

If anything, the opposite has happened and DSLRs have pretty much caught up with mirrorless cameras for video."
54857,best water filter,"No offense, but that page contains marketing claims, not scientific support.  There's also a link to a PDF containing an economic impact study, which says nothing about the filter's effectiveness or operation.

""Scientific support"" would typically at least involve a study by an independent lab which assesses the filter's effectiveness on different types of contaminants."

43587,best items under $100,"I need to install my detachable shower head at the new house we moved to.

My husband and I are in a disagreement about it. I like being able to fully clean where the sun don't shine, but he feels like the water pressure decreases when it's installed. So I have to find a better, but more expensive, one that we can both be happy with."
