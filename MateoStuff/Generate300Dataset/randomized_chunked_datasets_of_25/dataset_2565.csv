9696,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I think so, but Manzanita may actually have them as well. Highly recommended honestly. My best friends all live in the same suite and they have a shared TV, PS4, and Switch plus communal board games, water bottles, etc. It works really well. Next year my entire suite will be friends, which will probably be really fun.

In my case, I don't really talk to my suite mates or know them on a personal level, but we don't bother each other at all and having the shared bathroom is nice. There's really no downside to it."
7599,best laptop for general use,"Good evening, I found your post when looking for a laptop for myself and I have not been able to really figure anything out as I do not too much. I am looking for a laptop within $1500-$1850 range with a great processor. I will be using it mainly for school, notes, business, and slight gaming on the side. Hoping it can run games like League, Valorant, Black Ops. Battery life is not the biggest issue but it is nice. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate your time in reading my message and helping me out."

20482,best workout music,"Me and my friend would get drunk and flail our arms around like hippies and sing the slow part. Then once the ""DIEEE!"" part came in, we'd headbang like a 2-man Slipknot.

Good times!"
23570,best car racing video game,"Sadly the same place depth has gone in a lot of other genres, down the shitter to appeal to as many people as possible.

I would say my favourite games of all time are XCOM UFO defence and Rome total war, i still play these modded today. And while they had problems as all old games do just compare the complexity and strategical depth on offer in 1994 and 2004 with sequels from 2016 and 2020. The heart and soul has just been completely ripped out and replaced with fancy graphics and dumbed down gameplay its disgusting it really is.

I guarantee anybody who has played modern XCom has at least heard of either of the Long war mods too, where the direct goal of this mod is increasing the length, difficulty and complexity of the base campaign. I mean do these companies not know how to take a hint? Hardcore gamers are still a big audience and nobody is catering to them."

24376,best anime,"Hands down, my boi NGE is always on top, on any list,
in every country. The anime with the biggest influence on the market, be it Movies (even Hollywood), References, Manga, Merchandising (had a problem with that back in the days) and the overall influence in all Anime’s/Games/Manga to follow. And it had one of the biggest Doujin impacts on the market."

12700,best gifts for mom,"Not a mother, but... maybe take her out to a nice restaurant where it's just the two of you, so you can have a good meal and nice conversation. I think that parents of grown children often want more one-on-one time, because that becomes pretty scarce once we grow up."
