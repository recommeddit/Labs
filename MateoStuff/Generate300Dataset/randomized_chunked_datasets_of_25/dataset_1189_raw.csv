A lot of people like the second in this series I think more than this first one. But I seem to be loyal to the first books I read by authors! ðŸ™ƒ

"Standard approach is to head to scholar.google.com, search for the paper, and hope a pdf download link appears to the right of the result. This often will be to an arXiv or preprint on the author's webpage.

Another option is to find a friend at a research university and have them download and share the paper with you using the university's subscription.

There are also less legal options, e.g. sci-hub.org, that often work when all else fails. Google for more info."

"Overnight oats. I don't like the taste of oatmeal after it's been cooked. I normally have to drown it in milk, butter, and sugar to make it palatable, which defeats the purpose of eating oatmeal. Overnight oats are made the night before and are eaten cold. Old Fashioned oats, almond milk, greek yogurt, chia seeds, fruit, and a sweetener. It comes out to about 300 calories, it's thick, and the oats are raw and taste better that way. You just pull it from the fridge, no cooking required."

"Hi, illustrator here. 

If you're in the US: [General's Kimberly Pencils](https://www.dickblick.com/products/generals-kimberly-drawing-pencils/) are a great first time pencil for art usages. They're as cheap as .75 cents a pencil and available in all the grades of hard and soft. Some people don't like them, but the way I think about them, it was the only pencil my high school art teacher supplied for our classes....and art teachers who work in K-12 have to provide a tools they can agree with, within a budget for classes of 15-20 students a class.

[Here's a quick example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfKZgA_ndiD/) of what can be done, I bought a few when I was at the art store the other day picking up more expensive supplies (because why not...they were .79 a pencil with a student discount). 

If you're not in the US, and/or once you get a feeling for what grades of pencils you like: Staedtler Mars Lumograph or Faber-Castell 9000. I use the Mars Lumograph in basically all my illustration work that's traditional, it's a very well built pencil, and can be found most places in the world at art stores. In the US, expect to pay [1.25-2.00 a pencil](https://www.dickblick.com/products/staedtler-lumograph-drawing-and-sketching-pencils/). 

[Faber Castell 9000s](https://www.dickblick.com/products/faber-castell-9000-pencils/) are also nice, but can be a bit harder to find off the internet, and I've seen them in those stores often priced more than the Lumograph as a result. 

If you just want to do cartooning/any sort of work you want to ink and/or color, you'll probably only need 2 or 3 grades. I use 2H-HB-2B. 2H is for sketch, HB is for final lines, and when I'm doing a drawing I'm pretty sure I'm not going to ink but I still want to look dark, I'll add 2B. Maybe 4B, but at that grade I smudge like crazy.

If you want to do realistic shading with only graphite, I'd recommend buying a box set with all the grades and working from there. This is why I recommended General's, the entire set of their pencils will run you about $10. Then upgrade to a nicer pencil as you go along.

I would only buy mechanical or Blackwing AFTER you've figured out what you want to draw an an artist, as they both have somewhat unique applications in drawing. Mechanical can be good on the environment and good for sketching/drafting/fine details. I never liked shading with them though, and clutch pencils can be expensive. Blackwings are great for dark details, but not so great for anything that needs clean erasing.

Just my 2 cents. Cheers!"
"I had also considered the LG you were looking at, but ended up going with the GL83A-B. Been a fantastic monitor so far, super responsive, great resolution and viewing angles, all that jazz. Doesn't have as wide of a color range as the GL850, but as others have said, most really won't notice the difference, and some actually prefer the GL83A-B's colors because it can look less oversaturated in game and much closer to the developers' intended colors. Overall, $120 cheaper and the only real difference is that color gamut. Can't recommend the GL83A-B enough!"
Pale pink and emerald green were my bedroom colors as a kid in the 90s....oh lord.
I didn't learn until I was married that the pockets in women's jeans are about 1/3 as deep as the pockets in men's jeans - they are basically useless. I'm constantly carrying my wife's wallet and keys.
