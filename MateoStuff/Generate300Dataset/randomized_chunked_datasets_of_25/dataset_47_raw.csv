Curve crush has been the main one that people comment on for better and worse.
"That's a valid complaint, but keep in mind other benefits."
Right now only Puredistance Black. I wear other stuff maybe once every couple of weeks to break the monotony but I’m not emotionally attached to these frags.

[Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/statistical-learning-for-biomedical-data/D4F211C276E40658545379CFE589E6C6) was excellent at walking me through some of the easier machine learning techniques. It still remains a good reference book.

"It's a stupid PFF list, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Howard is going to play however he plays, regardless of where PFF 'projects' him to play.

People are downvoting because they get REAL upset when people criticize really stupid lists PFF produces."
Your post gives off the impression that you don’t know much about this side of life - which is fine because you are here to learn more and fix that
"I'm still a beginner in this world and one of my main resource is Datacamp, so it's nice to see more experienced people use it. However may I ask why? I'm just curious about what, someone in the field of bioinformatics, can get from Datacamp and find it useful on his day to day work."
"Whatever you do, don't look at this decision as the one that determines your career. Whatever language you learn first does not need to be the language you use in your first job, or the language you use 5 years from now.

Learning to program is hard. Learning a new language after you already know one is easy in comparison.

A lot of us recommend Python first because it's such a well-designed language. It's designed to make things easier for beginners but it's still powerful enough for pros. It's a great way to learn, and you'll still find it useful no matter what you do with your career.

In comparison, PHP may be one of the worst languages ever invented. It's a cobbled-together mess of inconsistent and broken patterns borrowed from other languages. If you have to use it, go for it - but I wouldn't recommend learning it first because it will teach you bad habits. It'd be better to learn a good language first.

JavaScript is somewhere in-between. It's definitely clunky, but it's gotten a lot better over time. Using TypeScript (which is compatible with JavaScript) is a great alternative. Also note that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all go together - they're not separate jobs; you'll be using all of them together."

"Actually, there is a rumor that Tom Holland will make a brief cameo.

> According to Jon Schnepp in an episode of Collider Heroes, “Tom Holland was on set filming scenes on Venom for at least two days as Peter Parker.” He went on to clarify that “I’m not saying Spider-Man is in the film. When I say Tom Holland’s Spider-Man is in the film, I’m saying Peter Parker is in the film.”"

Not all matte screen protectors are the same. Clearview or Elecom from Japan at Amazon.com is the best among all. Very minimum distortion and lots of tooth when writing on it. I don’t think there is any better than that in the market place. I personally had tried so many of them.
"Honestly same. I would often send people to smaller ""mom and pop"" vineyards, but it had to be sold as this boutique-y experience. If you told someone ""So there's this little farm down the road that sells some great wine, you literally just drive up and meet the farmer/owners since they don't do reservations"", they wouldn't go. But if you said ""I personally know the so-and-so's, they have this micro-vineyard tucked away from the main road where they make some of the BEST pinot in the insertnamehere valley, I highly recommend it. They are so small they don't even take reservations, otherwise they would book up and I'd never be able to get you in!"" the guests would coo and bolt for it. 

Best wine I've had has been cheapo stuff, and I've tasted a looooot of wine back in my hotelier days."

I don't agree with this one. If somebody is really into something and you're not it makes it difficult unless you know them very well and what they have or are looking for themselves.
