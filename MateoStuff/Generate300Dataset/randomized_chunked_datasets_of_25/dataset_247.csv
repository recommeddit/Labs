30180,"In the U.S. history book, I recall, we learn briefly of the Texas Independence as a division of the mostly English speaking protestants unable to buy land unless they became Catholic, a general cultural clash. The Alamo and the Goliad massacre were mentioned as well as the victory at the Battle of San Jacinto by Sam Houston.

For the Mexican-American war, it was Manifest Destiny. In this case we were the aggressors that baited Mexican troops in a grey Texas border area that helped spark the war. From there we had the landings at Vera Cruz, the march to Mexico City and its quick capitulation. A lot of the people fought in the war became important military people in the American Civil War. Then debate came up of the possibility of taking all of Mexico, but ended up taking a third because they didn't want all the Spanish speaking Catholics.

Finally the Gadsden Purchase, which was purchased from Mexico to help build a southern rail route to the west. Its purchase was more than what the United States gave to Mexico for the land ceded from the Mexican-American War and was only possible because the Mexican government was is horrific debt from the war.

While that sounds like a lot, class discussion was only 2-3 days at most before moving on to the American Civil War, where that would take over a month discussion. Basically, touched on the highlights in class and read the chapters at home, which most people did not do.",best Mexican war to study

16041,"I wear prescription sunglasses (since I wear prescription glasses all the time). Mine are Ray Bans (I only own one pair), simply because I liked how they looked on my face & I can't afford to buy new prescription sunglasses every month. Brand name doesn't bother me, so long a they look sensible on my face. Interestingly, the arms of my RayBans do not have a metal arm, they're only plastic, and the size/shape of my head meant they kept falling off until my awesome optician added some [glasses grips](http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/glasses-grips) onto the arms so they're fully adjustable and dont fall off anymore.
