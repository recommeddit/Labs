67426,">The funny thing is that I hate dependencies (hence the custom class) but when I looked at what is required to implement upload progress, it was just clear as day ‚Äúfuck it, we‚Äôre bringing in axios‚Äù.  Sometimes if an app has only one request I still write out the xhr even.  Axios is one of only two dependencies I use in js.

&#x200B;

I wrote the article to let people know fetch can do everything your 3rd party HTTP lib does. \*Maybe not always as simply\*, and you might still prefer using Axios if you often need progress updates. 

&#x200B;

The main point is fetch is now a far better developer experience than XmlHTTPRequest ever was. And many use cases I previously assumed were in the domain of 3rd party libraries are actually well supported - if not well documented.

I've taken this backpack to three countries (soon to be 4), three colleges, and many many many hours of slogging around campuses and airports. With 9 years of hindsight I might not have picked orange or that style of monogram, but it has room for my 15"" macbook pro, is comfortable for long walks to various libraries, and can hold at least 4 days of clothes if I pack right for short trips.

If you are only coding on windows i heard visual studio code is pretty nice if you want some more ide like features.

Or if you want to be the most 1337 haxxor in existence you could go gui-less with something like emacs or vim. From my experience it takes sum time to learn all the shortcuts and stuff but if you mastered it you are probably faster and more efficient.
