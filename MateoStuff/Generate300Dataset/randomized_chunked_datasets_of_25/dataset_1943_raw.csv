"Thank you for such a detailed response. Someone else suggested going to a breeder. I'll look into it and if it we can give it the proper amount of attention and if we can figure out where to place its home, then that seems like a cool choice.

"I will tell you what I *don't* want:  I don't want a damned card.  I feel obligated to read it and come up with some kind of response that will make you think I like it.  I don't.  Cards are a complete waste.  If you want to write me a letter, go ahead.  Don't buy me a card."
