68021,best science fiction novel,"Snow Crash is certainly easier to read than Neuromancer, and a great book, but IMHO Neuromancer is just one of those classics you have to read."
47240,best state to visit in the United States,"Skip Kentucky. Visit coastal California, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite (stay out of the Valley though in the summer), Southern Utah to hike and backpack, Wyoming/Montana, Manhattan, upper New England...oh and the Great Lakes region."
9465,best toothpaste,I have ClinPro too but I hate using it. It doesn't give that frothy satisfaction that you do with regular toothpaste.
63343,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Also that 32bits apps are not compatible on iOS 11+

Dragon age inquisition"
66874,best soccer team in the world,"5th was the only one I had to think about it, yeah.

Gave it to the Netherlands, but it was a close call vs France. 

Spain vs Uruguay for 7th place is another battle, which I could see going either way."
21012,best workout music,"Virtually anything from Run the Jewels. I play RTJ2 and RTJ3 back to back so that I don’t have to worry about skipping songs while I’m working out.

51335,best iphone case,"the best cases I found for my 12 pro were the ringke fusion with the matte clear back and the torras clear case, so i’ll get one of each and probably an apple silicone case when I pick up my phone. I tried everything this past year for some reason, 35 cases in total. I have cases from nomad, spigen, casetify, the official apple cases, pitaka mag cases, UAG… and i kept going back to those fucking $15 clear cases"
8365,best toothpaste,"Dental is not covered in the Swedish system either when you are older than 24 years.

I think it is cheaper though but cannot be sure as I don't know what type of treatment he got."
68920,best science fiction novel,"> This sub tends to stick to straight white male authors that write stories that don’t (or only tangentially) touch on modern politics, with the exception of two or three women that have gone leagues above and beyond many of the male authors. 

Probably because this sub is Print sci-fi, not print social and political opinions????? 

I highly, highly, highly, highly doubt the overwhelming vast majority of this sub would actively *avoid* or *prefer* a book written by either gender. People come here and just say ""I want a good book about aliens and first contact, anything cool come out recently?"" and then get recommendations based on that. 

I for one, absolutely do not care about who the author is IRL or what random stance they hold on any social, religious, or political topic. 100%, do not care. You could put a piece of tape over the authors name on the book, and never tell me a single thing about the author besides what other books they've written (so I can find or avoid them if I like their writing style) and I'm golden

It's honestly annoying how many books try to use their book to push an agenda one way or another. Bro, I don't care that you are an enlightened atheist, STFU and stop wasting pages with your thinly veiled anti-religious soap box and get back to describing the space battle between intergalactic fleets. 

I read books for enjoyment, not to get preached at by someone cramming their own personal views down my throat even if I completely agree with their views"
334,best terminal file manager reddit,"I notice on my work laptop, ranger has a ridiculous 2s startup time. So I resorted to lf, which is inspired by ranger and much faster"
52690,best hiphop album,"College Dropout is not only a fantastic rap album at face value but it really proved to the world that Kanye wasn't just a talented MC or producer, but rather a well rounded rap artist. The choice to release ""Through the Wire"" as a single was straight ballsy."
10116,best pencil for drawing,"I'll chime in with a vote for lead holders, get yourself a nice Mars Technico or something of the sort.  
  
Pigma Microns are pretty solid pens with a nice true black when scanned, but if you have the time and funds to spare I'd personally recommend trying out dip pens and brushes and inks.  
  
Paper is a pretty personal matter, Canson has some decent, cheaper sketchbooks as does Strathmore, and most of the papers both brands produce outside of that are nice too."
45098,best items under $100,"So throw it in my pocket when not in use, take it out to play with in the bathroom, and plug it in at night. Got it!"

55926,best action and adventure movie,"Huge Star Wars fan since I was 6. Not a big fan of origin stories in general. Wasn’t thrilled they were doing one for Han.

Finally watched it a couple weeks ago. It was such a blast. The new guy was no Harrison Ford, and it wasn’t without it’s issues, but I just had nothing but fun watching that movie."
