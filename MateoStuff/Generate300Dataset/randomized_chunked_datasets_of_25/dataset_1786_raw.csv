"Just wondering do you have a glass tempered screen protector, and how does it fit?"
"I misread, I thought you said don’t spend a zillion on fancy paint if you prep right. My B. 

I do disagree with the white is white though."
"I’m same spot as you but currently have a 1080p 144hz. Looking at the same monitors too. 

First off, get the Acer version of that ASUS monitor if you do. It’s the XB271 or something. Same panel but a lot of people say better QC. 

I’d recommend either IPS unless budget is a big constraint. Honestly I don’t know if I’d care IPS vs TN, but if I got the TN I’d always wonder how much IPS would be better. You’ll be looking at it every single time you use your PC so get one you love. I’m considering the UW because 120hz vs 144hz isn’t enough for me to care, and it’ll give me extra screen space for coding/school work. If you’re just gaming, then it’s up to you if $300 extra is worth it for the UW 

Also a store near me has RL on the Acer 1440p IPS UW and it looks amazing."
"I've become kind of a jerk about water. I will drink pretty much anything sparking, so cheap ol' seltzer for .50 a liter will do just fine. On the other hand, I like all sorts of (to me) strange mineral waters. I grew up in a town famed for its mineral springs, so I like all the high-mineral, salty-tasting waters. My favorite one right now is called Borsec, from Romania. I've only had one water ever that was too salty for me, and it was from the same Russian store I get the Borsec from, but I can't remember its name. I'd love to tell you all what it's called, so you can avoid it in the future."
You're totally invited. :D
"Makes sense, being on more lists at 50 puts you higher than a few top tens."
"Try Columbia, I got a pair about a year ago primarily for the UV protection which is amazing. Overall quality was quite sturdy. The aviators I got cost around  $45."

I'm sorry for your loss :( What was he like?
"Hate to be the contrarian here, but the extremely trace amounts of methanol you can find in ethanol based sanitizers are a literal non-issue. We’re talking a fraction of a mL present per bottle, basically what couldn’t be separated during the distillation process. You need to INGEST ~10mL of methanol for nerve damage to occur. Experts even agree these days that generally it’s not even worth removing the small doses from moonshine. You have to consume copious amounts of alcohol to get a toxic dose. 

Are you drinking hand sanitizer? No? You’re fine. This is the last thing you should ever worry about in a SHTF scenario. Just don’t drink your hand sanitizer."
"Been to Warsaw in summer. Can confirm. 

Also, Polish girls."
Putin is not so sure about that.
I love gin and tonic with lime
"Two hard boiled eggs, banana, handful of nuts and coffee. Keeps me full all morning."

"Best: Chocolate
Worst: Not chocolate"
"Thanks. 

>They use more energy, and I *believe* the are less reliable

Either would be reason plenty for me."
My dentist once told me that it isn't even the brushing that is the most important.  He said I would rather you floss and not brush than brush and not floss.  We were talking about how few people floss their teeth.
"When I was around 17 my room was a disaster. My mom always wanted it clean but I never would really get around to it. The night before mother's day I got home from work and just started cleaning my room. It took hours. When I was done I stuck a note on my door that said ""Happy Freaking Mother's day"" and went to bed. When I woke up the next afternoon my mom was so happy. Almost 20 years later she still has the note framed on her dresser."
"However, it is useful in a crash cart as a vasoconstrictor/vasopressor."
"Huh, that's the opposite for me. It's like pulling teeth trying to speak to the right department employee at home depot but everytime we go to Lowe's, employees are always asking if you need help and have never had issues. Definitely location dependent."
It’s cedar apple rust and you need to spray the tree in the spring to avoid it unfortunately.
"On weekdays: Oatmeal with blueberries and walnuts, or toast with peanut butter and banana

On weekends: Eggs over easy, toast or biscuits, assorted cheeses, muesli, yogurt and all the fruit I can find"
