26784,"Must own is so hard to say for other players since it's personal, but like others have said, it should be something that you love and can play regularly. 

In my case, I don't have the time to play long games, I own and love **Eclipse**, but it's probably leaving the collection because I only play once a year or so. 

For me personally, my collection would be incomplete if I didn't also own **Carcassonne**, **Castles of Burgundy**, **Ticket to Ride**, and **Diamonds**

If you play 2 player head to head games I'd recommend **Jaipur**

If you have parties, I also consider **Time's Up: Title Recall** and **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** to be essential.",best board games

3585,"Usually I start out with niche \(lol\), just to get some overall insight into a college I've found. They have some nice lists you can spin off from, and it's a really great tool for college explorations. You don't want to depend on any single site for all your info though. The reviews are pretty good too\- usually I'll start with the one stars and work my way up on different aspects. 

It's a little off the side, but I also like going on college admissions/specific college discords and just hitting ctrl\-f for certain keywords to see what other people think about certain colleges or majors. You'll get more thoughtful and research insights you won't be able to find online, although on chats like those you do want to take everything in with a grain of salt.

It's also easier to ask questions and get into contact with people at a certain college.",best college for research
