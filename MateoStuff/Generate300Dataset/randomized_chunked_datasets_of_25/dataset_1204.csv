5738,"Sass is a css preprocessing language that has two different filetypes, each used for different syntaxes. Beyond the file extension and the syntax, they are identical and always kept at the same version.

1. **SCSS** (Sassy CSS) - simply renaming a .css file to .scss produced a syntactically valid file. However you can edit it to use variables, mixins, math, nesting etc.
2. **Sass** (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) - This is like the shorthand version. There are now curly braces or semi-colons and accurate spacing is mandatory. This creates easier to read code and is faster to type and not prone to errors caused by forgetting a closing brackets or semi-colons at the end of lines. However you can't just copy/paste in regular CSS, it requires reformatting to Sass syntax.

###Code examples

SCSS: (spacing irrelevant, curly braces needed)

    #wrapper { display: block;
    p {color: #F00;}}

Sass (spacing mandatory, no semi-colons or curly braces allowed)

68233,"Favorites doesn't mean I think this is their best work, but:

*Wild Seed* by Octavia Butler

> This whole series set off a deep change in my worldview. This is the chronologically ""first"" novel of the Patternist series. All of Butler's themes are present and strong here, with a good dose of telepathic powers.

*A Fabulous, Formless Darkness* by Samuel R. Delany

> Conventionally known as *The Einstein Intersection*... and not at all by this poetic title Delany wanted to use. This novel is the instar to Delany's *Dhalgren*. Even hints at his even later novel *Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand* can be seen in this short novel.

*Four Ways to Forgiveness* by Ursula K. Le Guin

> A different, less epic and more affecting visit to a Hainish world. To me, this is Le Guin at her prime in this universe, the dirty and hard work of the rokaner, exposing the brutality of humanity, and showing how even our worst can be overcome. 

*Green Mars* by Kim Stanley Robinson

> The right way to start off a second installment in a trilogy--introduce a new generation (cast) of characters. Mars comes to life, and all the posturing of *Red Mars* comes to a head here. The only weakness of this book is its cliffhanger ending.

*The Fifth Head of Cerberus* by Gene Wolfe 

> Three parts, three perspectives, one planet. Best read after Le Guin's *Planets of Exile and Illusion*, to which Wolfe's novel subtly responds. Brilliant prose of a complex world about which you want to know more and more, but will just have to content yourself by reading closer.",best science fiction novel

44206,"A professional proof reader for my thesis. My thesis partner is severely dyslexic (grammar, spelling, structure of sentences/paragraphs), so I have to rewrite most of her stuff to make it legible. 

I don't want her to feel guilty about this because I know she's vulnerable about it, so I don't mention how long it takes or suggest getting professional proof reading. 

But sheesh. It takes about 1/3 of the time it took to write it originally, and that's not even good enough because I'm a foreigner and taught myself this language so I'm not 100%. Though she thinks I am. 

Edit: I *will* throw $100 after someone willing to proofread after I've tidied up. And buy you beer. And feel eternal gratitude. Catch: it's 100 pages, and in Danish.",best items under $100
