Ondes Martinot. There is a live version of Radiohead performing how to disappear completely with three or four of them and the sound is incredible.
My dream kitchen would look just like this with buttery yellow walls.  Just my two cents.
"haha for sure, glad to put more people on to him

"I like Tobey as Spider-Man the most because as I grew up he was Spider-Man. I’m not adding emphasis so let me do that real quick. I had a Spider-Man blanket, bike, costume, pillow, toys, damn near everything. I played the games on PS2 and GameCube."
"True, true. But Raiders is better, imo. And as far as ""Jones Girls"" go, Marion is better than Elsa, imo.

EDIT: I was talking about character-wise. Elsa is pretty bland, when compared to Marion."

As a bassist I have to agree. You can play so many types of rock music with bass just by long notes in verses and 8th notes in chorus. Maybe with a few extra notes in between. So many bands seem to have just put the kid with least amount of skill playing instruments on the bass and it shows looking through a lots of bands repertoire.
"WoW!
Thanks man! 
In our time of occurring everywhere paywalls this is a great post!

FYI: sci-hub was established by a woman from Russia. And this source cut off access for Russians because of extremely inadequate, offensive behavior of Russian scientists towards the creator of the service.

The disrespect for Nas here is astounding.
"Just finished reading ""Caesar: Life of a Colossus"" and one thing that the author mentions is that Carthage just didn't understand why Rome didn't give up.  Other cultures understood when they had lost...the Romans just didn't understand they had lost."
Have you ever listened to his mood muzik series that’s what made me respect his pen. It’s easy to clown him lol but if haven’t give it a try real talk. There’s a reason he was part of SlaughterHouse.

"I second this. The new Edge (Chromium) is so good, it's like Chrome minus the bloat and it runs so much better. It's what Chrome should've been."
"Agreed. It was like he was finally at peace after thousands of years of combat, destruction, paranoia, and grief. You can tell Wenwu had begun to resent his existence because he spent most of the back story and modern day oriented on the preservation of his family (and perhaps more importantly, its power) rather than to be a good father. He's forgotten how to love them, but remembers that he *should* love them. Of course, he believes he is a good father, but is so consumed by grief that he would rather train his children to be assassins than to give up the powers that make them a target to people who want to challenge the family (this is completely justified in the narrative because of his wife's death). 

You can see that the moment he realises his wife lives on in his son's abilities to control the rings, he knows two things. First, that his son is powerful and skilled enough to wield the rings and he can now finally rest. And two, that his son carries both the abilities his mother had and the abilities he himself had trained into him. It's said multiple times through the film that Shang-Chi (and just about everyone) is the product of all those who came before. Shang-Chi has finally achieved his potential. 

Wenwu sees this in his final moments and realises he has no need of the rings for himself, and so accepts death, after thousands of years, knowing that his wife lives on in his son and the rings are carried by his son who is worthy.

I would've loved to see more Wenwu and specifically Tony Leung as Wenwu, but it would have been selfish to have him stay alive. His story, one that spans thousands of years, is over, and he achieved what he wanted."
"Louisville, Kentucky in May. We host the [Kentucky Derby](http://www.kentuckyderby.com/). Major acts roll in to preform, the weather is (generally) nice, and there are a bajillion things to do. There's a bunch of new clubs in the downtown circuit, plus we have tons of microbreweries for casual luncheons. Tis a lot of fun. Promise."
