"Actually it appears that it's the least efficient size to manufacture and only uses 70% of a glass panel (less efficient), so the price will be very close to the 48"" TV.

"" Those efficiencies mean that 48-inch TVs could reduce in price significantly in comparison to last year‚Äôs models. Don‚Äôt expect the 42-inch to beat it by a huge amount though as its yields are much worse. There are new techniques which could improve the 42-inch panel yield to 87%, but they come with additional production complexity, and therefore higher cost.¬† ""

"I mean, there are quality limits... I could spend $20 on a PC that would be better quality than the laptop I own and am using right now (1998 Intel Pentium 2 core 2 thread w/ integrated graphics card), it is poor quality, and growth is hard (or harder) when you can only go to 480p on stream. Internet is a whole other story (mine is garbage so...) It depends on the person to invest some money in equipment or not, me, I need a PC of some form before any other upgrade (I do stream it's just really really bad) so I can see the growth I want because I can do what I want on stream and have it not be 480p."

"Naa, mines just a mouth guard that fits on the top teeth only, to level out my bite and to stop grinding my teeth. Tbh, I think my mouth breathing habit comes from the fact that I also have a deviated septum and quite my nose will clog up enough where I can't comfortably breathe through it. Also doesn't help that I've become minorly allergic to cats... and own a cat. 

I brush my tongue the best I can (super sensitive gag reflex. Seriously sticking my tongue out too far makes me gag -.-) and I have a sonicare tooth brush. So I try my best."
