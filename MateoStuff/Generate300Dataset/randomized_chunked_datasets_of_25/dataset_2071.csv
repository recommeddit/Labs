60715,"1. John Mulany: Come Back Kid

2. Anthony Jeselnik: Thoughts and Prayers

3. Bert Kreischer: Secret Time

4. Tom Segura Disgraceful

That's my top ranking right now I think.

Edit: I wanted to add to the list that Chelsea Peretti's: One of the Greats is pretty amazing too. It definitely isn't going to be for everyone, but if you like her style of humor in Brooklyn 99 it's definitely worth a watch. I liked it quite a bit. I might put that at number 5.

I haven't seen the new Chris Rock one or the new Adam Sandler one yet. The Ron White one was awful in my opinion. 

Bill Burr and Joe Rogan are high up on my list to watch soon, but the problem I have always had with both of them is I often don't get where they are being ""funny"". I like them both quite a bit, but to me It kinda just feels like they get up and say things that make sense. This is definitely more true with Joe Rogan.

Edit 2: I am watching Joe Rogan's Triggered right now.",Best comedy show on Netflix

You need heat to unlock parts and cars, and you need money to buy them so you have to play both modes to progress. I'm enjoying it, the story mode is cringe acting (Miami Vice springs to mind) but in a fun cheesy way.",best car racing video game

7487,"Hey! I've been searching for hours. I'm looking for a budget laptop that's also snappy. Not going to do any gaming on it. 

Looking for something:

* Under $400 (Ideally the cheaper the better)

* Will mostly be using Audacity for simple instrument recording, nothing too demanding. Maybe some web browsing and video streaming.

* At least 2 usb ports

* Battery isn't important as it will stay in one spot mostly connected to a charger. 

* SSD would be preferred. 

* I'm sure I'm probably only going to find 4GB of RAM within my price range and specifications, but if a dual 8gb (2x4gb) exists in that range that would be nice. 

Hopefully something exists at that price.",best laptop for general use
