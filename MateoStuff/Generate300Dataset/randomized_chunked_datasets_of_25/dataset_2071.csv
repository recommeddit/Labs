4941,best home improvement store,"I once heard on reddit “Home Depot to build a home, Lowe’s to finish a home”. I find this to be very true. Home Depot has all the functional bits all the time. Lowe’s however has much better choices when it comes to the aesthetics, their lighting aisle for example blows HD out of the water."

48130,best color to paint with,"I find Pale blue completely depressing. I had that colour on the walls when I was a kid and my mum still apologises. Hate it so much I won't even wear pale blue. 

A pale blue room is my version of hell."

31133,best country to live in,"I live in Stockholm and it ticks of all the boxes of your request. Especially if you want to live in a big city and be near nature. The biggest downside though is that it’s pretty difficult to find somewhere to live, at least in central Stockholm."
60715,Best comedy show on Netflix,"1. John Mulany: Come Back Kid

2. Anthony Jeselnik: Thoughts and Prayers

3. Bert Kreischer: Secret Time

4. Tom Segura Disgraceful

That's my top ranking right now I think.

Edit: I wanted to add to the list that Chelsea Peretti's: One of the Greats is pretty amazing too. It definitely isn't going to be for everyone, but if you like her style of humor in Brooklyn 99 it's definitely worth a watch. I liked it quite a bit. I might put that at number 5.

I haven't seen the new Chris Rock one or the new Adam Sandler one yet. The Ron White one was awful in my opinion. 

Bill Burr and Joe Rogan are high up on my list to watch soon, but the problem I have always had with both of them is I often don't get where they are being ""funny"". I like them both quite a bit, but to me It kinda just feels like they get up and say things that make sense. This is definitely more true with Joe Rogan.

Edit 2: I am watching Joe Rogan's Triggered right now."
31339,best country to live in,"Have no idea what you are talking about. When I have moved jobs and to different countries, the companies have always given me relocation benefits. When I moved to the US in 98, I got $10,000 in relocation. Why do you need so much money?"
33610,best electric car,"I don't think that's an option on our 2012. And in addition, we still have 4 months of the year below 15f so it wouldn't help much. For those months the Volt averages about 6l/100km."

24204,best anime,"It was made in 2016, so it's still pretty recent.  It'll probably enter the top 100 as more bloggers publish new lists."

2278,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,"am i the only one that thinks Slice of Italy isn't very good? I don't know why people keep praising this place, its pretty average pizza."
23462,best car racing video game,"Its quite a cool mechanic to be honest, it has a day mode where you earn money in legal street races, and a night mode when you earn ""heat"" (read: exp).

You need heat to unlock parts and cars, and you need money to buy them so you have to play both modes to progress. I'm enjoying it, the story mode is cringe acting (Miami Vice springs to mind) but in a fun cheesy way."
55443,best action and adventure novel series,"hmm i dont know if lost world refers to dinosaurs or just lost world in general.  maybe try the Island in the sea of time series by sterling.  some action, fun read, the contemporary island of nantucket is sent back to neolithic era."
7487,best laptop for general use,"Hey! I've been searching for hours. I'm looking for a budget laptop that's also snappy. Not going to do any gaming on it. 

Looking for something:

* Under $400 (Ideally the cheaper the better)

* Will mostly be using Audacity for simple instrument recording, nothing too demanding. Maybe some web browsing and video streaming.

* At least 2 usb ports

* Battery isn't important as it will stay in one spot mostly connected to a charger. 

* SSD would be preferred. 

* I'm sure I'm probably only going to find 4GB of RAM within my price range and specifications, but if a dual 8gb (2x4gb) exists in that range that would be nice. 

Hopefully something exists at that price."

13195,best gifts for mom,"My only problem with that is that when you're nursing, if anyone massages your back and shoulders, it tugs on whatever mechanics controlling the milk.  My friend would rub my shoulders and invariably, I'd start to leak milk.  Maybe it was just me.  I was sort of a bionic cow when it came to producing milk."
15782,best sunglasses for fashion,"[Thom Browne](https://thombrowneeyewear.com/thom-men/) makes some pretty dope shit. Actually not the crazy unwearable lookbook looks I expect from Thom Browne, but, like, really compelling very wearable legitimate things."
