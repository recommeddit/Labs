36559,best alcoholic drink,Whiskey. Neat.
24017,best anime,Sell me Steins;gate. I see lot's of people recommend it but based off the synopsis it doesn't seem like my thing. I feel like i may be missing something.
62183,Best RPG game on PS4,"I've never understood how it's not fun. I had way more fun playing this than 95% of the RPGs out there. At least it's not full of grinding, bullet sponges, pointless/soulless dialogue, and clearing enemy camps. I'll take RDR2 to boring formula of most other ARPGs. To each his own, I guess."
70684,best movies with a cool twist,Not many people seem to remember that Movie. LOVED it!

15456,best tree for the garden,"Don't even think about any kind of maple except the native ones, and native to central or west TX not east. You can get TX native gardening books out of the library and there is also a COA green gardening guide.

How old is the big is the oak and when was it planted? If it was recently, it may just need to get over transplant shock and get established well. Most oaks around here are really good trees but you have to watch out for oak wilt. Red oaks get good fall color.

Be sure to pay attention to the soil requirements of any other trees you plant. Some can take the limestone and some can take the clay but usually not both."
39650,best podcast for biologists,They're getting better.
33203,best electric car,"There are people that Supercharge exclusively. The highest mileage Model 3 (probably upwards of 140k miles by now) famously had 2% degradation @ 100k miles on Supecharging alone. Here in EP (suuuuper hot) we're at about 309/310 miles after 1.5 years/20k miles. But again, anecdotal evidence.

Good luck with the move! Plugshare shows a few apartment complexes in Dallas with EV chargers. If you're dealing with the owner directly you could probably ask them about adding an outlet (worked for us!)"
42179,movies like Inception,Frailty.

52789,best hiphop album,I'm reasonably certain most of the people on this sub are \<21 years old. Look at how many times Kendrick Lamar is mentioned in this thread alone.

57044,best water brand,"Nah, I just looked on the bottles, unless they're very long source springs, they're not the same. Poland Spring lists the names of springs in Maine, ShopRite doesn't list specific names, but lists certain areas in Pennsylvania."
62659,Best RPG game on PS4,"Based on your top 2 you should really check out Jade Empire. 

It’s back when BioWare was pumpin out classics still. There is Kung Fu, a party member possessed by demons, Nathon Fillion, whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird."
950,best ice cream flavor,"I was expecting to have to ctrl-f to find the correct answer, Butter Pecan. I am so happy right now and proud of Reddit"
29763,best money managing app,"I just checked -- my net worth is up 150ish% since I started using it in Jan 2016. I'm out of credit card debt, paid off a car loan and my student debt, put aside 20k+ in investments and savings, and I'm now about a month ahead of my regular expenses, so I'm no longer living paycheck to paycheck. Absolutely worth it for me."
