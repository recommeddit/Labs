69151,"The most useful college major is the one that fits best for the person. Not everyone will be, nor should be, a STEM major. For some people STEM is the best, for others, it is English, or Literature, others yet is Music, Theater, Communications, Art. 

The thing is... a college major is not an end point. It is not ""The Decision"" that will affect you forever.",best major to study in college
12906,"I am a mother with a 6 year old child, a job, and volunteer responsibilities.  What I really want is some time alone.

I want a night (one full 24 hours) in a hotel room by. my. self.  It doesn't have to be super expensive.  Just clean and comfortable.  I want to be there all night long.  I want food delivered, I want my kindle, and I want a glass of wine.  I do not want to speak to another living soul for the entire night, and I do not want anyone to talk to me.  I do not want to see little fingers poking under the bathroom door while I'm taking a shit.  I do not want to get to the most suspenseful part of my book, only to be interrupted because someone wants a glass of milk/tie their shoes/can't find their lucky pillow.  I want to walk around completely naked without someone commenting on my flab or pubes or the zit on my back.  I want to wake up without a tiny little face inches away from my own, or a foot in my face, or a 65 pound dog jumping on my stomach.

In short, I want to be alone.  In absolute peace and quiet.

Edit:  Also, for gods fucking sake... The last thing I want to do is spend time with YOUR mother.  She's got both her kids out of the house, all day fucking long to do whatever she wants, and gets a full nights rest every night.  She's not in the trenches, and therefore... she doesn't get what she wants.",best gifts for mom

Xsoft has more cushion. It's super cozy, but at times my forearm would sink in too much and get hot while I'm playing, so for that reason I preferred the soft. They're both great, just matters how much you dig in. If you still want to dig a bit to control your shots on soft you totally can.",best artisan mousepad alternatives
