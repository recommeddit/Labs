You wrap the toast around the tasty ball inside.
"Was entering the thread to post this. Nice job, Charlie."
"Actually Persol and Ray-ban are both owned by Luxottica. Revo was owned by Oakley (another Luxottica brand) but was sold off in 2013.

Persols are awesome though."
"I have just got the new tor book edited by Charlie Jane Anders. I've only read a few stories from it and they're very good so far.

Unfortunately I'm not enjoying the story by the editor very much so far but I'm interested to see where they are going with it."

"I'm also surprised that people are picking Khloe, cz she's literally such a disgusting person. My opinion of her changed after the whole Jordyn saga. Even tho people on here say but Khloe had every right to feel the way she felt. What right does she have to call women bitches that needs to stop fxcking their men. She's the worst of them all."
"Infinity War, Endgame, Raknarok, Iron Man, Civil War, Winter Soldier, GOTG, Homecoming, Avengers, and a tie for basically whatever because the rest are kind of similar in many ways. Standard formula stuff. I think I liked Ant-Man more than most people. I'd probably put that above Black Panther and maybe Doctor Strange just because it's a quirky sort of intro instead of boilerplate like BP. Ant-Man and Wasp on the other hand is near the bottom with Thor and stuff."

I'm not into his more recent works as much and the Science in the Capitol series has some good ideas but is take it or leave it."
The Goonies.

"I don’t think there is a bad MCU movie. Once you’ve seen Green Lantern, you can’t call the MCU bad."
Four Packers in the top 15. Feels good. Mostly.
How about Silvermist from Sherwin Williams? It's one of the ones I am considering for my place.
Vanilla is my favorite flavor because it is rich and delicious and doesn't need anything else added to be super enjoyable.
All of Eyedeas albums are gold too.
"Or just go straight to Arch. That's what I recommend.

Ubuntu is wasted time, you won't learn much with that."
What's the artist name?
"I do agree with what you said, I think 3rd generation is fantastic, but I think op should got their respective remakes and not the original version."
"i use an otsu xsoft and can switch between it and the ac+ perfectly. both solid mousepads, wouldn't mind using either. can confidently recommend the aqua control+ black."
