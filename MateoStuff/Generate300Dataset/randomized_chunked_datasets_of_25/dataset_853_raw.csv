"My father had all the L Ron Hubbard novels, including this awesome looking hardback series with really actiony covers. My mother would never let me read them as a kid though, I never knew why, obviously learned about the controversy with Hubbard later. 

Battlefield Earth sounded fun. That film sure was something."

"Lose Yourself is higher than Eye of the Tiger.

Eye of the fucking tiger."
I'm surprised. I was a P/A/-S/A road warrior in my 30s-40s and found many women were happy to date men who were only on site for 6-12 months.
I've never found a book I've needed on these websites... Am I doing something wrong?

I personally find Dune to be in the 'Star Wars' category of science fiction. Aka fantasy. So wont include it. The 'science' in Dune is more political/cultural than tech.
