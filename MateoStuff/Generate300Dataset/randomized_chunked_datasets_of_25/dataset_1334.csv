51123,"It's become pretty much cliche at this point to hate on these sort of lists whenever they come out. People will inevitably make comments like-

""X album should have been higher! This list is bullshit!""

Or-

""X album should have been lower! This list is bullshit!""

Or- 

""Where the hell is X? This list is bullshit!""

But generally speaking, I like the list. It has a good mix of genres, a lot of albums that I have never even heard of before, and a good mix of ""classics"" and newer releases. Sure, we can nitpick over it for weeks to come, but in the end it's just a list. If you don't like it, don't act like it's the end of the world.

Just look at NME's description of their list-

""The final, definitive, definitely last of its kind, never to be repeated, comprehensive and absolutely accurate word on the best records ever.""

They're actually making fun of anyone who claims ranking albums is a matter of fact and not opinion.",best rap album

55296,"*Gulliver's Travels* by Jonathan Swift.  

As a kid, I had read an abridged and illustrated version of the popular Lilliput episode and liked it well enough. But it was only later when I read the book in its original unabridged form that I grew to appreciate Swift's vibrant imagination and ingenuity. The world-building really impressed me, and the curiosity to know what sort of people/creatures the titular character would encounter and what their interactions would bring kept me turning the pages. I also found it really neat how Swift managed to weave social commentary and satire into what seems like a simple adventure story on the surface.",best action and adventure novel series
