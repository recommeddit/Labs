The one player I can't fit anywhere is Martin Crowe. Anyway. This is how I'd rank them."
8385,best toothpaste,I've never had a toothbrush fray severely. I've seen some people's brushes that were frayed to shit. How do they even do that? Wtf?
71529,best movies with a cool twist,"True, that was spectacular."
51123,best rap album,"It's become pretty much cliche at this point to hate on these sort of lists whenever they come out. People will inevitably make comments like-

""X album should have been higher! This list is bullshit!""

Or-

""X album should have been lower! This list is bullshit!""

Or- 

""Where the hell is X? This list is bullshit!""

But generally speaking, I like the list. It has a good mix of genres, a lot of albums that I have never even heard of before, and a good mix of ""classics"" and newer releases. Sure, we can nitpick over it for weeks to come, but in the end it's just a list. If you don't like it, don't act like it's the end of the world.

Just look at NME's description of their list-

""The final, definitive, definitely last of its kind, never to be repeated, comprehensive and absolutely accurate word on the best records ever.""

They're actually making fun of anyone who claims ranking albums is a matter of fact and not opinion."

54207,best medicine for a cold,"A cup of chicken soup, a cup of orange juice, a cup of hot tea with lemon and honey, and a cup of peppermint tea. All washed down by water. Take an antihistamine, and a couple ibuprofen. Sleep as much as possible and eat something light. Wrap up warm. All good!"
55296,best action and adventure novel series,"*Gulliver's Travels* by Jonathan Swift.  

As a kid, I had read an abridged and illustrated version of the popular Lilliput episode and liked it well enough. But it was only later when I read the book in its original unabridged form that I grew to appreciate Swift's vibrant imagination and ingenuity. The world-building really impressed me, and the curiosity to know what sort of people/creatures the titular character would encounter and what their interactions would bring kept me turning the pages. I also found it really neat how Swift managed to weave social commentary and satire into what seems like a simple adventure story on the surface."
69493,best major to study in college,"A large majority of nurses will retire in the next 5-15 years.  Also it depends on your area.  New York, California, and Florida are a little rough right now for nurses, especially new grads.  I live in Virginia and we are hiring nurses all the time.  The new grads that pass their NCLEX the first try after graduation find work within 3 months of graduation."

71327,best movies with a cool twist,"That's not true at all. The first plot twist was in 1903, in The Great Train Robbery. 1920(?) The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, and last but not least, Citizen Kane. Such a masterclass movie and a classic. Well, these are 'different' twists than twists these day but they are all considered as twists. :) And The sting got 3 votes in the comments, Im sure I will watch it next week! :D"
