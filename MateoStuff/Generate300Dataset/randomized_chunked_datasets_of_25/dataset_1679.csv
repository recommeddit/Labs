A couple years ago, I ran into Skrillex in a public rest stop in Maine. He was doing a show later that night in the area, but for obvious reasons, I thought the restroom was a bad place to try to say hello. By the time I got outside, he was already on his tour bus.

15794,">You're blaming these issues on the glasses when it's really your lifestyle that can't handle them.

[Oh ho ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY1k1GcZRww) 

I'm not the person you replied to, but you're kinda right. At the same time, it's always nice to have a pair of sunglasses you're going to wear at a place where there's high risk of them breaking or something like that (ie, times when you anticipate being rowdy). I'm thinking of stuff like festivals, where you might need to block out the sun, be (potentially) intoxicated, or maybe just know the sun is going to come down before the event ends. Massive crowds = more chances of sunnies getting knocked off, stepped on, etc.

But yes - if you invest in a pair of nice sunglasses, you bet they're going to not break as easily as a cheap pair, and you'll be more mindful of where you keep them and who you allow to hold them. They'll also be more resistant to scratches, which is where I feel a lot of cheap sunglasses fail.",best sunglasses for fashion

68181,"No need to pit any disclaimers to Warren Ellis; in my opinion he's one of the finest current sci-fi authors.  I love most of his stuff, in particular *Transmetropolitan*, but I'm afraid he's overextending himself a little right now.  He's got three ongoing series: *Trees* and *Injection* are definitely science fiction, and both are excellent.  Most recently he rebooted *Wild C.A.Ts*, which is more of a superhero kind of sci-fi (the original and related titles, such as *Stormwatch* and *Authority* are still among my favorite superhero books), but I'm somewhat ambivalent about his latest effort.  I'm afraid that with so many projects at once he'll do another *Planetary* and essentially abandon the stories.",best science fiction novel

16497,"I am a lover of nice sunglasses.  I've had two pairs of Oakleys, two pairs of Ray-Bans, and one pair of Revo sunglasses over the years.

As far as shapes that will be fashionable for awhile, I think that you'll always be able to find people wearing aviators.  I have the [Ray-Ban Cockpit Aviators] (http://www.amazon.com/Ray-Ban-Cockpit-RB3362-003-32/dp/B001GNBK1S), and I love them.  I have a small-ish face, and the lenses are a little smaller than standard Ray-Ban aviators.  I bought them online after I tried on one of my friend's standard aviator sunglasses.  I knew that the standard ones weren't for me, so I figured I'd give the Cockpits a try.

I've read that people think that Ray-Bans are crappy for the price, but I've had two pairs of Ray-Bans, and I really like them both.  They've held up well over time, I like the styles, and they've protected my eyes from the sun.  Not really sure what people think makes them ""crappy.""  [Revo sunglasses] (http://www.revo.com/) are supposed to be good sunglasses, but a year after I bought mine I couldn't wear them anymore because the ear-pieces had stretched out a ton and I couldn't keep them on my face anymore.  One pair of my Ray-Bans is 10 years old now, and I still wear them.

As far as I can tell, the only place that you'll be able to get them ""on sale"" will probably be Amazon.  I was trying to get a good deal on my Cockpit sunglasses and ended up giving up and paying full price.  I wanted polarized lenses (they're so worth it), though, so that may have been why they never went on sale.
