"He's incredibly descriptive, almost too much description. If he wasn't a science fiction writer, it'd be immensely too much... But when you're describing a planet and the civilization that grew up on it, I feel like you're justified in near excessive description. 

Not to mention he does trend towards too many characters and having a massive cast. But I still think they're some of the best books written, for what they are. Nothing too introspective, not a whole lot of hidden messaging... Just a solid space opera where the good guys usually win and gallivanting around the Galaxy isn't taken too seriously. I wish there were more books like his."
"Oh You're absolutely right! I was even beta-testing their latest Mac version and didn't notice. But now that You pointed that out, I wrote the beta team and suggested they added proper support for Wacom devices."

"When looking for a mini tripod, what do I need it to have so it will work with my Logitech Streamcam? The camera from logitech DID NOT include a tripod with it. I was looking at one of the Joby ones. Thanks"

"I agree it would still be in mannings favor by a decent amount( regular season purposes)
My point was more that toms play at the end of his career(last 2 years) has been incredible and it's being left out of that thinking because manning has been retired. 
Also the chance he has a year or two left of good play."
"What I do is brush once thoroughly, rinse, and then apply a light second coat without rinsing. Feels way cleaner than just letting old food stick around.




This also prevents me from swallowing all of the toothpaste I used every single night, only however much was used for the light second coating."

"Ahhh gotcha, some providers factor in that auto-pay discount on their displayed price and some don't on their own websites (T-Mobile lists the price with auto-pay applied, while Verizon doesn't).

Thanks for the post it's been super useful as I am switching plans sometime soon, I appreciate that work you put in on this!"
"Sounds perfect. So more quest adventure and not too much military battles/politics, etc?"

"Same! I remember hearing more and more about the accolades and Pulitzer Prizes a few faculty were pulling in, but I didnâ€™t feel like I was getting *that* level of prestige education.

On the other hand, I learned the value of critical thinking and found my career during those four years, while studying hard and enjoying the benefits of IV. We attended during a sweet time, I think."
"I use progress to track uploading documents via Axios. I was using Fetch in my React project until I needed to support progress, at which point I bailed and switched to axios. Seems like a huge oversight in Fetch, and is a total show stopper for me."
