"""Dad, here is some beer. We are going to leave you alone for the day.""  Dad looks over, clutching his 20-year sobriety pin. He recalls the days when his family used to enjoy seeing him come home from work. ""I just don't want to be alone no more."" The son comes back at night to find the father has drunk himself to death. 

Wow, great advice OP."
"It's worth noting size as well. The difference between say, large wayfarers and small wayfarers, is important. You could look like a diva or a man in children's sunglasses. Get a pair of sunglasses you like and take their basic measurements. That way you have a baseline for what you're looking for if ever shopping online."
Shit Snacks.
"Haha, this is certainly a very Polygon list. There are some good books in there though - and several of them aren't nearly as heavy-handed in their social critique as these entries would have you believe. The Only Good Indians would be my pick of the bunch, but Vagabonds and The Salvage Crew both look interesting."
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Say what you want about Kanye as a person but he is a master of his craft.
Maybe you can find them in the hammock district on third.

"It appears that the main difference between ‚Äúnational‚Äù and ‚Äúregional‚Äù schools is how many doctoral programs are offered. Fresno offers 8, making it just one of 2 CSU campuses with more than 5. (The other one is SDSU, which offers 23.) Meanwhile, SJSU offers 2 doctoral programs. And Cal Poly is one of seven CSU schools that apparently doesn‚Äôt offer any doctoral programs at all. 

Anyway, I think that‚Äôs why SDSU and Fresno are the only Cal States in the ‚Äúnational‚Äù rankings, though it easily could have been just SDSU as they‚Äôre the real outlier when it comes to doctoral degrees."
"Same here.  Eggs can be cut with a butter knife.  Plus, the size of one muffin would not be enough for me for breakfast üòâ"

"Also, the third cube movie (I believe Cube Zero) is really good. Second one is just mehhhhh."
"I like Thor 1 more than Black Panther. I thought it was a really fun movie that did a good job introducing the general audience to Asgard, something that is very hard to do. Plus it gave us Hemsworth‚Äôs Thor, Hiddleston‚Äôs Loki, and Hopkins‚Äô Odin who are all fantastic. Thor 2 is my least favorite MCU film."
EUREKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 7!
"If my A/C is on 70, I am wearing a sweater and socks. Who wants to wear socks in the summer?

I would not accept a summer that didn‚Äôt hit 80¬∞ regularly to be ‚Äúwarm.‚Äù Above 90¬∞ would be a ‚Äúhot‚Äù summer."
Because lobster red just isn't my color.
"Same here. I used to wear it allll the time. Also, this guy once smelled it on me and said he name to me. It was so random, but cute, and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúmy daughter makes me buy her that perfume every Christmas"

Nothing like a film that you have to look up afterwards to work out what you just watched.

Okay thanks! My friend insists on buying a 144hz monitor for himself even though he only has a gt 730. I know it‚Äôs stupid but he is most likely going to do it and I can‚Äôt stop him. He barely hits 60 FPS in fort nite at 1280 x 720.
"I have only played inis once, via TTS and even then it was one of the best games I have ever played."
"I'm also a college student and had no prior music experience. I chose piano because it seems the most versatile. I'm interested in eventually composing, and the piano keyboard seems to be (understandably) the standard as an interface to all musical notes and music theory. Using MIDI, you can input through the piano to a computer, and use samples to effectively play any instrument, or even a synth instrument that doesn't even exist! The downside is that it's not portable and you can't walk around playing it, and it's less ""cool."" If you want to save money you could start out with less keys, just a few octaves. I have a full 88 weighted key piano, but have never used almost 2/3rds of the keys."
