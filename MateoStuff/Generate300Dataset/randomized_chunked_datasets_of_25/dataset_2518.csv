37027,best roller coaster at six flags,"I don't think Cedar Point really has to use theming. It is just an amusment park. I think what they do right now it perfect: Using the land and great landscaping to make the rides look their best. When I went to Six Flags I hated their theming. It looked tacking, cheap, and ugly. Also, the look of a bunch of differently themed rides next to each other isn't that great. Theme parks should be the only parks that theme their rides. Amusement parks shouldn't have to. Theme parks do it much better because they are able to theme entire parks of the park to make everything match and look its best. I like the direction that the Cedar Fair parks are going, but I guess everyone has a different opinion."

Extremely good quality, really affordable

I really recommend these!"
25492,best cricket teams of all time,"South Africa's ODI team in the '90s was terrifying/awesome. An even scarier proposition than '90s Australia. I really think their legacy would have been very different if it weren't for those awful World Cup exits. I still remember, going into the '99 World Cup, they were massive favorites."
41742,movies like Inception,"Watched it a couple of hours ago and the behind the scenes stuff. I really liked it, great story, great effects and very well shot. Can't get over Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff from RHPS) and Bruce Spence (The gyro captain from The Road Warrior) are in it! For sure the voice over they put in would have really been a major spoiler. The director and a couple of other people in the special features have really hilarious comments about that voice over even needing to be put in at all."

55249,best places to hike in the east coast,"I'll ditto /u/stajlocke's recommendation of Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  If you have access to a car it's about 3-4 hours west of Charlotte.  There's a ton of options here- including portions of the Appalachian Trail, as recommended by /u/JohanCzaczke.  It also wouldn't be hard to put together a loop itinerary so you don't have to worry about backtracking.  And finally, April puts you in the height of wildflower season in the southern Appalachian Mountains, so the scenery should be pretty good.  

Make sure you do your research on the regulations and especially the permit system- it would suck to show up only to not be able to hike there because you didn't get a permit.  

Other options worth considering include Linville Gorge (check on permits here, I don't think they are needed in April but you'll want to be sure), the Mt. Mitchell/Black Mountains area, the combined Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock and Citico Creek Wilderness Areas, and the combined Shining Rock and Middle Prong Wilderness Areas (note that fires are not permitted here)."

37485,best amusement park,"Disney parks. 

Turned California adventures into a great full day park with cars land, guardians of the galaxy, Pixar pier, and world of color, in addition to a fantastic Halloween party this year. 

They celebrated 60 years at Disneyland and refurbished MANY of their rides and shows, and opened up Galaxyâ€™s Edge there AND at...

..Walt Disney World.  They opened up a skyliner transportation system. Seven dwarfs mine train. Frozen (RIP maelstrom). Opened Toy story land AND avatar land. 

Hong Kong opened their big thunder mountain, iron man experience, and created an exceptional ride experience with mystic manor. 

And, they opened Disneyland Shanghai."

26872,best board games,I always read about how great 18Chesapeake is as an intro to 18xx but does the fact that itâ€™s a much more forgiving game perhaps lead to an okay but not great experience. In my experience itâ€™s the knives that make 18xx what people love about 18xx. Without then is there enough here to actually get players enthusiastic for more?
