72093,"So, just some related discussion here. I think the reason why this film's ""twist"" is so satisfying is that it doesn't exist for its own sake - it's a part of a wider stream of catharsis for the characters, and the resolution of a lot of mystery throughout the film. The Sixth Sense had a fantastic twist that enhanced the film, but it didn't *need* the twist to be successful. Unbreakable (my personal favorite) had a great twist as well, which really [spoiler](/s ""threw Sam Jackson's character's obsession into a new context."") Signs also had everything ""working out"" and coming together because that was part of the movie's theme. Only The Village's twist is really a gimmick. People have this idea that Shyamalan is a hack because he ""relies on twists"" or some such thing, but his later movies aren't bad because of their reliance on tropes; they're bad because they're *bad*.",best movies with a cool twist

9619,"Well, I can't tell you which is best, but I personally love Anacapa. I'll tell you most of the people who are in San Miguel, Manzanita, and Santa Rosa tend to want to move out. It's a bit anti-social and quiet. 

My experience:

- Low Rise/ 2 Story Dorms - 
*Good for a more calm sense of community, less hassle moving stuff, more spacious rooms, all are forced triples
*RAs are more chill as well as the RDs 

Santa Cruz - Recently remodeled, has a very modern and beachy vibe. Showers and bathtubs are clean, but are a bit tacky. The color scheme may be off but overall probably the most ""chill"" (you could argue that for Manzanita but that's more ""boring""). Right next to DLG dining commons.

Santa Rosa - The oldest dorm out of the three low rise dorms. Very big, home to Black Scholars floor. To me, it always seemed anti-social, quiet, and almost eerily creepy sometimes. Everything is older, bigger, and in general does not have the homey feel Anacapa and Santa Cruz have. Has a piano tho and right next to DLG. 

Anacapa - People say its the most social/upbeat out of the low rises. I would say that's true. It was remodeled the year before Santa Cruz and the carpet and walls are bright and cheery. Home to Scholars and Asian Pacific Islander Floor. I'm personally on the API floor although I'm not asian and everyone on the hall pretty much knows each other even if you're not super close. Very social and a very popular pick. We have some cool RAs too. Also, beach views.

- High Rise Dorms -
*floors can be very social, but equally not as social 
*less spacious
*usually a mix of doubles and triples or just doubles

San Nic - Home to FSSP, everyone knows each other since you spend like 6 weeks with one another. Extremely social atmosphere but half the time elevators dont work so moving can be a bit of a pain in the ass. Right next to DLG, Ortega, and UCEN.

San Miguel - For some reason not as social as FSSP, and I think all are doubles. A lot of my friends don't spend a lot of time with their dorm friends but you know thats just me. Right next to San Nic, which is right next to Ortega and UCEN.

FT - Crazy ass social dorm. 1 mile off campus means less incentive to leave which means more time in your dorm partying. A lot of hooking up and little parties, the RAs are more a bit more strict here. You get to know people on your floor and its very easy to get to know people in your building. Has your own pool and dining commons, not too far from the shopping center by bike. 10 min bike ride to school or your take the bus. You get a lot of ""FUCK FT"" hate but uhhh right of passage I guess

Manzanita - In it's own little bubble. Home to second years +, so it's quieter and less social. People move out because they want the more social freshman experience but its not impossible to have fun. One of my friends is on a health floor (I think) and loves it. Roomier, and has a more ""family"" feel to it, but also more isolated, and on the other side of campus (Carillo dining common). But you're also closer to IV.

Basically this is from my experience visiting and talking to friends. I don't know all the different types of floor communities by heart. Definitely talk to some people about it. I'm on API and I've met some amazing people here :)",best dorm hall at UCSB
