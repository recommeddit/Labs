11899,best gifts for dad,"There are a few cool things I got my dad the past few years.  

A moss terrarium which are everywhere online are neat.  They're like bottles with a moss world inside them.  My dad is a pilot and weather enthusiast, so I always get him something themed to those hobbies.  Like a clock that looks like the gauges in the cockpit, or a storm glass.

Another neat gift for someone the age 30+ is a retro flip style alarm clock, but new!  I got one for my pops, real cool.  I actually want one.

Also loom at a ""cog clock.""  I thought that was a neat one."

On the opposite end of the spectrum at another car show when I was about 16 (15 years ago) at the cow palace in San Francisco I saw James Hetfield (lead singer of Metallica) from afar and he was just by himself looking at the cars and my brother recognized him first and told me. I then got really excited and went up to him and he was super friendly and we talked for about 10 mins and I was telling him how I was learning guitar and was learning some Metallica intros and so on and he was just the coolest guy and was showing (what appeared to be) genuine interest. After talking he asked if he could sign anything for me so I gave home a program to sign. 

Later on about a hour later I saw him again from afar and he yelled out ""hey whitechevelle!"" 

Left a huge impression on me after all these years"
