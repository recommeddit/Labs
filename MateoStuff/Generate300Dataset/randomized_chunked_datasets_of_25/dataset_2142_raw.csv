"I bought the 11 immediately after it came out just because my old phone died and the ten series was essentially discontinued. I think you may wait and find it’s a super long time, or you might commit and it comes out in a month. I kind of wish I waited for the SE2, but I’m happy with the 11. I would just do the Apple upgrade program with the 11 if you think you need the 12, but the iOS 14 will come to the 11 too, so"
Are there any ranking systems based on research impact alone?
You're right that could have been better. I actually just ordered two [LG M36 18650 3450mAh 5.1A](https://www.18650batterystore.com/18650-Battery-p/lg-m36.htm) on sale for $4 and two [Samsung 50E 21700 5000mAh 9.8A](https://www.18650batterystore.com/21700-p/samsung-50e.htm) to go in the larger PB2S. I'll have gone from a total 10000mah to 16900mah at the same size and nearly the same weight.
"Forza Horizon 3, The Crew 2, NFS HP Remastered, Hotshot Racing, and Forza Motorsport  6.

FH3 is FH4 but better imo. Less replayability than FH4 since the lack of series but it has an active multiplayer and is very fun.

The Crew 2 is similar to FH4 b it has planes, boats, and cars, and the summit which is similar to a series usually features cars rather than planes, something which is preferred by most people who play racing games. It is almost a mix of FH4 in terms of gameplay and NFS Heat in terms of driving mechanics and customization. Lots of replayability and lots of fun.

NFS HP Remastered is a great game in terms of gameplay. Not much replayability, no storyline, or any car customization. People get this game because of the racing itself and not much else. Multiplayer is fun but I find the career to be more entertaining.

Hotshot racing is a simple arcade style game. Worth a try if you have GP. It’s like NFS HP R in terms of gameplay, no story but very fun events.

FM6 is better than FM7 imo. The game feels more smooth and organized and the progression is *somewhat* better than FM7 (FM7 gives you a Mclaren F1 right off the start). Definitely a good mix between sim and arcade."
I thought it was great but also overrated. It’s certainly not the number one MCU movie for me.
Super easy to spot your school if it's out west too.
"This right here. Fantastic app. No ads. Never crashes. Use it all the time, daily. Almost perfect."
"Tons of carbs and proteins.  Eat it and then immediately take some medicine.  If you're home, take the drowsy kind and pass out. 16+ hours of sleep, food, and feeling sorry for yourself and you'll feel better the next day."
"Oooh I get what you're saying. Honestly I'm just waiting for a good small wireless ergo. At this point I'm holding out for puc v2, model d- wireless. Just gonna stick with my orochi v2 until one of them comes out.

Thank you! ♥"
"You're probably joking, but in case you aren't: England, France, Brazil, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, Netherlands, Belgium, Serbia, Croatia."
">The mustang being the first real competition

Wouldn't that honor fall on the Taycan as the Model S's first *real* competitor?

The Mach E would definitely be the Model 3's, though."
So should we not refer to Donald by his initials because it was a running back's nickname?

"1. Larry Fitzgerald - Hands down. I've waited on him at multiple venues and he's a total class act. He was genuinely interested in the people around him, and was just generally friendly and well spoken. 

2. Jaleel White is as charming as Urkel was annoying. I made a mistake with his table and he was super cool about it. 

3. Neil deGrasse Tyson was nice enough. He declined and thanked me when I offered to buy him a drink. 

4. Orlando Bloom was polite but I didn't interact with him much apart from asking if it was ok to pet his dog before realizing who it was."
"yeah the 11 pro felt identical to my X, except heavier, more difficult to grip because of the backside frosted glass, and a better camera, with a big price tag. The camera isn't very important to me. So I returned it."
"Ah yes, Naive spelled backwards."
"I love how he composes himself, explains everything into the camera slowly walks out of the screen and just starts screaming with laughter again."

"Thanks for the suggestion. I watched it the other night and loved it. 


Jesus Christ. It's one of those movies where when it ends, you just sit there trying to process what the fuck just happened. Amazing film"
I agree with you about Kylie. Always going on and on about wanting to be normal. At least Kim admits she loves fame and attention. Kylie loves it but acts like she doesn’t to seem relatable I guess? Idk. She wants the money and fame and attention but only when it benefits her. Can’t have your cake and eat it too.
"I don't know if you're curious or just trying to be condescending. I have it on like 16 in my list. It's not a bad movie but it is the worst Avengers movie imo. Endgame made it retroactively better. It was trying to go bigger and better in a lot of stuff The Avengers did, but it didn't particularly land well for me. It wasn't as fresh and cramming bogged it down.

Ultron was okay. I still get chills when I see him in the teaser for the movie. But in it, he was a bit underwhelming. IDK if it's the jokes he made or what, he wasn't threatening at all. I felt nothing when Quicksilver died. He had no resonance and it felt like he was killed just to tick a sacrifice checklist. 

I can appreciate what Whedon was trying to go for with Hawkeye but I'm not a huge fan of it. I think I liked him more in the Avengers, mainly due to the iconic shots he took. Still his pep talk to Wanda was great. It was also Vision's best appearance. I liked his final convo with Ultron. The final battle itself had some cool scenes, but it wasn't that memorable for me. Most of the action in the movie was just okay. Hulk v Hulk-buster was great though. 

Banner and Nat's romance was so forced it ruined their characters in the movie for me. Their chemistry was so awkward. I get what he was going for but it still sucked imo. Cap brought a lot of nuance in the role and I like how it was all paid off! Thor was okay but the setup with him was jarring. AoU was me least favourite Tony Stark appearance. He was given stuff to work with, but he felt so tired in the role. His vision was paid off well but in execution it felt like it was taken out of a fanfic. 

That's the thing, the movie feels like how a fanboy would write it - too much being crammed so that none of it lands that well. It was trying hard to pull your emotional strings but failed for me. Another issue was the humour. The Whedon-ism was strong with this one. AoU and Vol 2 had the most forced humour imo. Unlike the original Avengers, which had some of the best banter. I was tired of the constant quips and wit in it.

Regardless I still like the movie, though I don't love it. And I'm glad you enjoy it. Sorry for the essay!"
"While I loved Sheela (probably one of the intriguing characters I've ever watched), it was Jane Stork (a.k.a. Ma Shanti B), the elderly white haired lady from Australia, whose story really touched me the most. I mean, going from being a housewife to committing assassinations, I can't even imagine."
Home depot has changed their dog policy. The one in my area said we couldn't bring him in there.
"I like those features. I think of it this way. This will be an expensive bank, particularly compared to known dependable brands like Anker.  However a majority of the time I am not hiking so I can use it to charge my macbook air.  In the remainder of the time I need it for hiking it should be comparatively light to other models.  I have a very similar LiPo anker 20k/mah brick and it is 392g, if they can get this down significantly it will sell itself.  If the ports, internal IC circuit and general build quality are as reliable as my Anker it will be a good purchase."
