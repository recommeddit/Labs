I think pegasus is so awesome but not many ppl seem to agree. Herod and Layton / Layton exclucif sucks imo
I woulda guessed middle aged (Korous/Fahrenheit) that cares about showing off big dick energy lol
"Ah that makes sense. I still have old games that I play on my Xbox, and I just sold my Xbox one x for $250 so I might as well buy the series x."
"i wish any other browser also has those capabilities like firefox. 

firefox on windows is just so better than ff on ubuntu. But, firefox sucks on Android. So being a Ubuntu & Android user, i am currently using brave.

if i was only using windows, i would have gone with ff"
I knew it was coming and I'm still crying
*The Years of Rice and Salt* is my absolute favourite alternate history novel.
"I was gifted a pair of [Malibu Jim Venus Pools](https://www.mauijim.com/en/shop/sunglasses/cat-eye/venus-pools) and I fucking love them. I have very light, super sensitive eyes and I'm prone to migraines (eye strain is a trigger) so I *need* good sunglasses. If (heaven forbid) I lose or break these I will definitely repurchase MJ's, though maybe a slightly lower end model."
My favorite one of his is the alcoholic some rich guys tried to kill for Insurence fraud... But he just kept coming back!
Older movies like this don't get the appreciation they deserve.  Have my upvote.
Gotta have those Nine-Nine cold opens.
"I see. Sticking with a Mac device would actually be a great choice simply because the MacBook Air has great performance with the Apple M1 chip, plus it has a great battery life. But, if you'd like to go with Windows, I'd go with the ASUS Zenbook 13 on my list. Most laptops with 11th gen Intel CPUs have great battery life because of their efficiency."
Nier Automata OST
"I felt like it was weird that they had both fine art and studio art on the list, rather than just fine art as that includes studio art. I'm assuming fine art is exactly the same as studio art, but it also includes music, performance art, dance, and maybe something else? But then why do they have theater and drama under its own category if those things are included in fine arts?

And out of curiosity, do you have one full time job as a graphic designer and then also do freelance stuff on the side, or all freelancing?"
"Do you guys even read? His list is pretty clear so why are you suggesting Switzerland and Nordics? Both are miserable 7 months out of the year.  

OP think about Portugal. I’m an American living in Switzerland and I can’t wait to get out of this place. Portugal is a near perfect match for what you’re looking to achieve. It’s my next stop."
Hoya's one?
Thank you! My curiosity is definitely piqued
I use ReadEra :)
"China.

China is the future."
"The Greatcoats series by Sebastien de Castell, definitely.
A trio of musketeer-like characters trying to rebuild the peacekeeping order they were part of before their king was murdered and it was disbanded.

Lots of witty banter and prettt much going from adventure to another adventure on their travel.

First book is not long and can be satisfying as standalone i’d say."
It's supposedly the most popular ice cream flavour in the States.
"This is a massively inspiring post. Thanks for sharing, I will need to rethink a few things."
"Not in order:
Infinity blade 3, Minecraft, Dead cells, Honkai impact 3, The Room (all the games)"

"Masturbation. 

Been going 5 times a day, everyday for the last 8 years. 

In that time frame I've only been sick three times."
