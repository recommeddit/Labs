21984,"I had a good experience with her too. 

I was in LA on a holiday (I’m not from the states) and saw a commotion on the walk of fame. I went to have a look at it turned out Hugh Jackman was getting his star. The whole cast of Les Mis was there.

Most of the people watching were professional autograph hawkers/sellers. They got given autographs but zero interaction. 

Anne noticed I was clearly just an average joe and actually spoke to me, made some jokes, shook my hand. She came across as genuine and kind. 

I also happened to meet literally ten celebrities on my US trip and she was probably the only one who was as good looking in person.",best celebrity

Actually whatever kind of dog you get should be the kind you want because at that age they are too young to really take care of a dog.

52276,"I would say that EITHER *Pimp* or *good kidd* would belong on a top 10 list, but I don't think both. 

&#x200B;

I don't think *Atrocity Exhibition* is top 10 material (and i say this as a fan of Brown since *Hybrid*).

&#x200B;

I think my one controversial take here would be that DJ Shadow might not belong in a top 10, but it is a classic and influential and important etc. 

&#x200B;

Also, for a top 10 list no entries that came out prior to the 90s? No Rakim, Kool G., Schoolly, etc.? I believe top 10 lists should have variety that represent the best hip-hop has offered acroos the spectrum.

Overall, if this was someone's personal list, I would say they know their shit. But as a ""Best of all time list"", nah.",best hiphop album
