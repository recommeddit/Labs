How about those months wirh no to little sun.

How exactly do you just get an armored car to come make a delivery? That seems like a lot of money to just be picking up and driving around impromptu. Or do you send the bill for the truck to the client who wanted the money?
"Oh totally!

But it is summertime, so a ""nice cold drink"" is usually on the list for most folks."
"Let me add on to this. This was hands down the best buy under 100 dollars for me as well. Also, the hot and cold water makes no difference. I have mine hooked up to just the cold water line. You wash for 10 to 20 seconds max. You will barely feel any chill by the time you are done. So, save yourselves the pain of drawing hot water line and go cold!! I bought mine from home depot here in Canada."
Best investment! Xr and airpods pro! Have both and theyâ€™re ðŸ”¥
"Monk and Psych both have strong comedic elements.

These are old school but easy to find:

Perry Mason (old B&W 1 hour episodes are amazingly well written and acted)

Columbo (90 minutes)

Matlock

Murder She Wrote"
"this is cool, thanks for this!

Matches pretty well with my process."
"Pro tip I learned the hard way: you can floss improperly. I thought I was doing okay just popping the floss in an out, but it's best to make a ""C"" shape around each side of the tooth. Once I did that my checkups got a lot better."
"When I get a head cold, that is more often than not accompanied with a sore throat, I get a decongestant,Mucinex or a generic brand, and take some sort of pain reliever. This combination helps to get all of the snot out and the pain reliever can help with over all aches and pains. Don't go for any of that high in vitamin C crap you'll just be wasting your money, you cannot cure a cold, you can only make the symptoms bearable until you ride it out.  Hope you find something that works and feel better!"

"Â£20 and BIFL rarely go in the same sentence, especially with electronics at play. 

I have a Lenmar PPW20000k that's awesome. Paid about $100 for it. 

4-5 full charges from dead on iPhone 6
4 USB ports: 2 for phones at 5v 1A, 2 for tablets 5v 2.4 A
Pass through charging (important!)

Small enough to fit in a coat pocket, bigger than a jeans pocket. 

Good luck!"
"I posted this same thread in the dentistry subreddit, and many dentists commented the same advice -- don't rinse your mouth immediately after brushing. Just spit out the excess and let the rest sit, and this way you're actually giving time to the fluoride to do its thing."

"Had it bookmarked for years, but should really start on it soon, thanks for the reminder, I'll have to bump it up the queue. Didn't know it was 7 seasons deep, definitely an encouraging factor for me at the moment!!"
Thank you. I do plan to look seriously at LAC's as well!
"To be fair, thereâ€™s a lot of stuff you could leave out at work that would also get eaten really quickly"
"Not technically true crime but..... 

The Americans (FX Now) 

Breaking Bad (Netflix) 

***both of these compelling series will draw you in like Mad Men; THE BEST **** 

Also the Keepers (Netflix)  is the most enthralling true crime documentary Iâ€™ve ever seen. Iâ€™ve watched it twice. 

I think Babylon Berlin is one of the more under appreciated shows in Netflix. Loved it! 

I just started Dark thanks to this sub and Iâ€™ll have to add Broadchurch to the list next!"
"Piano, so many songs to pick from"
I once got my mum a neon pink bobble hat as a joke along with her actual Xmas present. She apsolutely loved it and wore it everywhere. It became a thing that I got her the most obnoxious colour hat I could find every year. She had quite the collection by the time she passed away.
"That is so awesome. If my 3yr old would get me a Dinosaur or Spongebob or whatever wallet, I would proudly use the shit out of it until he/she is old enough to be  properly embarrassed of it."

"Ive gotten complements on Dunhill Red and Escada Magnetism. Escada Magnetism starts to smell like the lingering smell of smoked tobacco and alcohol after about 30 minutes.

Also, fruity flavoured bubblegum."
