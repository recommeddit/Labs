The other 9 were given Colgate in an Ultra-Brite tube.
Oh god yes. I would love a hammock.
"Romances generally drive me nuts, but I love Jennifer Crusie!  I keep looking for similar authors but haven't found anyone comparable.  Suzanne Brockmann is probably the closest one so far.  Do you have a second favorite?"
"Well, short of a full thread: Kirkland has a few lines of full grain leather belts. One of them \-\- I'm not sure how to identify it \-\- is actually full grain. For dirt cheap. Do it."
Guaranteed health care?

"""Ending"" A isn't actually an ending, it's more like completing chapter 1 of 3. Basically mislabelled because the game should be called finished when you make the choice between ""ending"" C or D, which actually results in a conclusion.

"Tried Prism, YNAB, Mint, Personal Capital, .. I just stick with Mint. I don't really budget though. I just track net worth, transactions, and monthly in/out. 

Looks like there's other android apps I haven't tried though. 

""Wallet"" (budgetbakers.com), ""Monefy"", etc."

"Will oleander survive hard Winters?

I've never seen them anywhere except a mediterranean climate."
Yep ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
"The Sixth Sense is the right answer.

This is not an opinion."
Take out the papers and trash or you won't get NO spending cash.
"I feel ashamed for not seeing it from a mile away, but the twist in Wreck-it-Ralph was amazing.

Blew my mind and I was totally sober."

I wouldn't want to give them more reason to chuck my stuff.
7 instead of 8 by Rank 1.... holy crap that song can get you through some heavy lifts!
"WGU is amazing if you're looking at IT, you get a ton of certifications as you go through the program- I admit I am biased because I work there, but OP's situation sounds exactly like most of the students I get- if you want more information you can PM me."
Yeah that's like saying there's no difference between old navy and banana republic clothing.
"That it's not that much of a WRPG does not mean it's barely an RPG. It's absolutely and without any doubt an RPG. Much more so than HZD or Bloodborne, in my opinion.

Is it the definitive RPG as the other guy said? To that, I'd say no."
