40536,I've been looking to buy a new system and was looking a lot at benchmarks on yt and can confirm that the 5700xt is comparable to the 2070s the fps differs 3-7 in some occasions 10 fps. But then it depends if you want that raytracing tech or not I personally don't need it cause I still think the raytracing tech is in its baby shoes so price/performance yeah a 5700xt makes more sence,best midrange GPU

65186,"A few years ago, when I was living in North Dakota, Verizon was the only one that consistently worked in my town. I was on AT&T when I moved up there and had to switch. Apparently AT&T didn't have their own towers in the area. I would even drop calls in my apartment, so Verizon it was. Both AT&T and verizon work in my home town where I live now, but Verizon is better imo. My mom dad and sister switched, because the verizon family plan cost less than the AT&T option. I was already on verizon at that time since I had them from when I moved.

I would guess 99% of people use either Verizon or AT&T in my area. Sprint and T mobile don't get used much here.

62742,"Yeah that response seemed a bit up its ass to me. I'm not done with The Signal and the Noise yet, but the commenter seems convinced Silver spends the whole book talking about how perfect his models are when what I've liked about the book is how careful Silver is to *not* make those claims. He goes out of his way to acknowledge that choosing easy battles and not overselling the odds is the main reason for his success.",Best Data Science textbook
