40536,best midrange GPU,I've been looking to buy a new system and was looking a lot at benchmarks on yt and can confirm that the 5700xt is comparable to the 2070s the fps differs 3-7 in some occasions 10 fps. But then it depends if you want that raytracing tech or not I personally don't need it cause I still think the raytracing tech is in its baby shoes so price/performance yeah a 5700xt makes more sence
20271,best workout music,"Creeping Death or Trapped Under Ice - Metallica

They'll light a fire under your sweaty butt."
65186,best phone service company,"A few years ago, when I was living in North Dakota, Verizon was the only one that consistently worked in my town. I was on AT&T when I moved up there and had to switch. Apparently AT&T didn't have their own towers in the area. I would even drop calls in my apartment, so Verizon it was. Both AT&T and verizon work in my home town where I live now, but Verizon is better imo. My mom dad and sister switched, because the verizon family plan cost less than the AT&T option. I was already on verizon at that time since I had them from when I moved.

I would guess 99% of people use either Verizon or AT&T in my area. Sprint and T mobile don't get used much here.

If you don't pick unlimited plans a lot of bigger companies have discounts on phone plans if you work for them."
7646,best laptop for general use,"Ok thank you very much for the help. I will check the Amazon page you linked in the guide as much as possible.

73286,best Linux distro,"Define ""lots of apps that are also on windows"". If your mean apps like Adobe photoshop,... 

I'd suggest to stay on windows.

If otherwise you mean apps like discord, Skype,...

I'd suggest to go with Linux mint or Ubuntu they both are good choices."

38518,best newspapers to read,"I read the metro paper 3-4 times a week, mostly just to spend time (as the paper is written by leftist retards). And if I'm eating at a restaurant, I'll often try to get a hold of a serious newspaper if it's available."
45784,best trick or treating candy,"Reese's and butterfingers are the best. Also, people hate on the generic candy in plain wrappers, but the ones with the wrappers that look like a strawberry that are kind of hard on the outside but gooey on the inside are the shit and no one can tell me otherwise. 

Dots are the worst."

68374,best science fiction novel,"> which to modern readers makes it seem like the authors personally agree with it.

They were both very conservative, and weren't shy about saying so on forums and so forth, so it's a pretty fair conclusion."
57693,best cologne,Smells so good. Always get compliments with this one.
48482,best color to paint with,"Perfect! We had the consultation, she gave us the paint recommendations, we bought the paint and then did all the painting ourselves. It was a great experience since there was no pressure to buy from SW. Enjoy the ride! We are 36 days in since our close and we finally see the light at the end of the tunnel."
33487,best electric car,"It's ok, most people can't afford any new car anyway."
65588,best phone service company,Verizon for sure T-Mobile's not bad they're all pretty good. You have to know the history of all these companies Verizon comes from Cellular One which turned into airtouch which turned in Pacific Bell and then Verizon I believe
62742,Best Data Science textbook,"Yeah that response seemed a bit up its ass to me. I'm not done with The Signal and the Noise yet, but the commenter seems convinced Silver spends the whole book talking about how perfect his models are when what I've liked about the book is how careful Silver is to *not* make those claims. He goes out of his way to acknowledge that choosing easy battles and not overselling the odds is the main reason for his success."
