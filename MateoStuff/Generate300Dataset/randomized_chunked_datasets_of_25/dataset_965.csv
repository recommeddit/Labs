28418,"It seems like most quick breakfast foods are sweet.  Most flavored oatmeals, cereals, yogurt, fruit--all of it is sweet.  I hate eating sweet things for breakfast, but do it anyway because that's what is quick and fairly healthy. Maybe this is a good alternative that definitely could be made in a (somewhat) healthy way.

For me personally if I could pick, I’d really wanna hear a lowkey more off-kilter EP from her cause I like a lotta the elements she got.  Those can end up way better than whole albums for me w/ some artists like Ravyn Lenae, who I love & she’s only released EPs, no debut album yet.",best hiphop album
65427,"This table is awesome! If I may make a request for future revisions, could you try to keep the Data all in Gigabytes (i.e. 500MB->0.5, 2GB->2, etc.)? I think this may help the table sort a bit better when you're sorting by data, because right now, 2.5 comes before 2, and 100 MB comes after almost everything else.

Short of that nitpick, this is awesome! Totally gliding this 🙂",best phone service company
