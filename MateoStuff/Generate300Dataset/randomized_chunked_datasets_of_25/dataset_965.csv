37205,best amusement park,"Doesn’t look like it, Busch gardens is owned by Seaworld, and i don’t think it would be the most popular anywhere anyway."
8319,best toothpaste,Dish eshplainsh a lot
4643,best text editor,Visual Studio Code is cross platform and open source. You are probably mixing it up with Visual Studio. Vs Code is basically just a faster Atom
28418,best breakfast foods,"It seems like most quick breakfast foods are sweet.  Most flavored oatmeals, cereals, yogurt, fruit--all of it is sweet.  I hate eating sweet things for breakfast, but do it anyway because that's what is quick and fairly healthy. Maybe this is a good alternative that definitely could be made in a (somewhat) healthy way.

If you didn't want to make the batter, you could use pre-made pie crusts, though that might get expensive if you're making enough for a month."
24212,best anime,Surprised to see Hellsing as the runner up and not Hellsing Ultimate. I always got the impression the original was not especially liked

22254,best celebrity,"I had the pleasure of meeting both Paramore and Steps (if anyone still remembers them, I was like 12 at the time). 2 best days of my life (so far) probably.

Most friendly man among those, Taylor York. 
He showed alot of interest in the conversation, and probably asked us more questions about our lives, than we did about his."

53145,best hiphop album,"I really enjoyed “For Ya”, ”Goteo”, & “I Love Her” off her album.  I could definitely see her doing really well w/ the standouts on here.  

For me personally if I could pick, I’d really wanna hear a lowkey more off-kilter EP from her cause I like a lotta the elements she got.  Those can end up way better than whole albums for me w/ some artists like Ravyn Lenae, who I love & she’s only released EPs, no debut album yet."
65427,best phone service company,"This table is awesome! If I may make a request for future revisions, could you try to keep the Data all in Gigabytes (i.e. 500MB->0.5, 2GB->2, etc.)? I think this may help the table sort a bit better when you're sorting by data, because right now, 2.5 comes before 2, and 100 MB comes after almost everything else.

Short of that nitpick, this is awesome! Totally gliding this 🙂"
56986,best water brand,"Hell, I remember it being good in the early 2000's. It probably changed a little more than a decade ago. I also remember that their bottles became way thinner and flimsier."
