71397,best movies with a cool twist,"'I am your father, Luke.' - I saw this in theaters back when there was no internet. Spun my head around."
43708,best items under $100,"I just have the regular ($9.99/month) plan, but yeah... if you consider how much I use it versus how much it costs, it's by far one of the best bargains ever.

And, in my case, even though I've had it for 3+ years, I've only actually paid for around 6 months out of my own pocket. I'm 47, my ""little"" sister is 43, and our parents are almost 70. So we're at the ""just get me a couple Spotify gift cards for Christmas"" stage. I think I'm paid through until March 2019, but after this upcoming Christmas it'll probably be March 2020."

72398,best keyboard switches,I had a couple and went back to rubberdome. They are mainly louder
53301,best usb c charging cable,"I disconnect my phone from its charging cable dozens of times per day. They wear out so quickly and buy new ones every few months.

I just buy whatever the gas station has, they all work for a while.

I used to buy Ankers but they don't last that long either. I'll never again spend a premium on something so generic."
55235,best places to hike in the east coast,Thank you guys so much. That was actually first on my list!
9097,best toothpaste,I've read that brushing without toothpaste actually removes substantially more plaque. Do you suggest toothpaste for the fluoride itself?

30597,best Mexican war to study,"Can you clarify the overall process of judging which war is justified/valid and which isn't?  I.e. what standards does a war have to meet to be justified?

I suspect that the methodology of determining justifiability of a war is quite subjective.  Korean War may be intervening in another country's internal affairs, but I doubt most South Koreans are upset at US for getting involved."
44945,best items under $100,I wear darn tough hikers every day. $20 a pair but worth it. They're thick wool blend but not hot. On laundry day when I wear cheap synthetic socks my feet STINK

56001,best action and adventure movie,"Whenever people ask me why exactly I like the National Treasure movies, I say it's precisely for this reason, people aren't making adventure movies anymore. The National Treasure movies have a lot of flaws (like a *lot* of flaws) but they have the charm of an adventure movie that you just don't see anymore. I want more of that."

70388,best major to study in college,Wish I went to a school with a stats major. Econ/stats double would have been perfect for what I want to do (academia) but I’m stuck with an “applied math” major that has one stats class in it

19707,best YouTube video,"[Dramatic Chipmunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw). Short and sweet, still makes me giggle after having seen it probably thousands of times at this point. Definitely a hall of fame Youtube vid."
