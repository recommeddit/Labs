"Bro it'sjust not even the right place to ask this question. No disrespect but make a post, don't put it in thread asking about something completely different."
Any movie mentioned in this thread will be ruined if you haven't seen it already.  Plot twists are supposed to be a surprise that you didn't see coming.  Not something that you're actively looking for and anticipating.
"I used to take it before breakfast and after I swallow the clove, I feel this horrible burning sensation but then it's gone right away."
So helpful thank you.

Also (although unrelated to the topic of file management): rest of `moreutils` is also worth getting familiar with."
Can you explain the throwing money situation? Or link an article? Need that tea!!!
"I think you misunderstood me.
 
I didn't say that ARPGs are not RPGs. They definitely are, and has always been.
 
But many games are described now as RPG, when they would be more of action or adventure games.
 
What I said is that almost any game now try to fit in the RPG genre in description, because the name is appealing more than before.
 
I love both types, turn based or action."

"Cool of you to try some comparisons.

I had a chance to try out Paperlike since that's what my pal uses, but opted to get iCarez and just upgrade if the quality was worse for mine. iCarez is very smooth, easy to install, and the quality was very similar. I think the fineness the the matte finish makes the screen quality drop equally to the Paperlike but the trade off is worth it to me and you get used to it."

As a student I wouldn't place Bergen university on my top 3 list of universities I've studied at, and I've only been to 2"
"Haven't stayed in Navi Mumbai but my vote would go to the Oberoi in Mumbai itself (Nariman Point). Stayed here for work a dozen times and their service is just second to none.

I think the Oberoi in Udaipur often makes it onto Best Hotels in the World lists."
"Really really hot sauna, if you don't have a sauna then just a really really hot shower, then while still in there, take a shot of whiskey or other dark liquor. It really clears the sinuses!"

"The box that my bidet came in had glowing user reviews on it. One of them said something like, ""whenever I go to work and I have to wipe like a peasant, it makes me really sad."" I thought it was funny when I first read it, but I've actually had that experience now and it turns out the box was right."
