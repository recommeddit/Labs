Yeah there are a lot of online guides to using it
"*The Black Arrow*, by Robert Louis Stevenson.  Love, war, bandits, battles, and betrayal, all set in a fascinating historical period.

Edit: Just noticed the ""Lost World"" bit.  This doesn't fit that, but still a great adventure novel!"
Finally!! :D
Definitely exists.  You can find at least the vast majority of audiobooks (not volunteer).

You just gave me my breakfast for this weekend. Thanks!
"I'm curious about this ""party"" thing with Visible. There are subreddits set up for joining Visible parties. Some of them have more than a 1,000 people in them. Is there any downside to being in such a party? Can the other people in the party bug you or bother you somehow?  


If there's no real downside to being in a party of 1,000 random people, it seems the $25/month price should be reflected prominently in the spreadsheet somehow. This price makes the service ***very*** attractive."
"i mean, there has to be *something* to this, right? im not just getting messages from the TV again like when i shot President Reagan to impress Jodie Foster, am I?"

"Yeah hard agree on that... my takeaway is that SFA is decent for what it is and doesnt deserve all the ire it gets, but I'd go to KD for Dominator and TT anyday. KD has much nicer landscaping and scenery too."

"Honey.  Whatever website you’re shopping on, the extension will be searching the web for the best coupon codes.  I save like $5 for some items I buy off Amazon but the best I’ve gotten was $60 getting knocked of an order of contact lenses."

"I wouldn't exactly say ""significantly"" with T-Mobile.  I'd say their coverage spread is about 70-75% of AT&T's and Verizon's.  T-Mobile's network is excellent when you have access to it.  Sprint not only has significantly less coverage, but their coverage also only goes up to 3G.  Sprint doesn't have 4G or LTE coverage in Hawaii yet."
Can you explain? It is hosted on *.gov domain. Why is it a problem?
