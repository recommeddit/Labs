">I've been meaning to get really into Gundam. Currently only 2 episodes into Zeta.

[Nice!](#rengehype) I assume you watched the original beforehand, have you seen any of the others yet?

> Btw i thought the TTGL movies were just glorified recaps. Is the second one really that great?

They are, but the second one has a lot more additions than the first one did (had a montage of stuff through [TTGL](/s ""the timeskip"") instead of it just *happening*, added some Nia characterization, and added a bit more Simon to the epilogue), [has its own remix of Sorairo Days](https://youtu.be/lyqFZFv3FcY), and the final battle somehow managed to be infinite times more hype than the final battle of the show was, which shouldn't be possible. Then again, doing the impossible is how Team Gurren rolls, so."
"Look at their videos, they recorded over 17000 versions of the song. Each for another name."
"Look at the Amazon Basic products. I have one that uses a micro USB cable that's built in but there are some that can be used with iPhone. Mine $17 USD, definitely a good buy in my book."

Dont hesitate friend. It's absolutely sublime. I seriously cannot think of anything wrong with it. Maybe no usb C ports but that's about it really.

"I have a Viotek GN27D 1440p@144hz freesync monitor. It is a VA panel and curved. The colors are really good, but the response time isnâ€™t the best. But as you said this is your second monitor not sure if the response time should be that high on the request list. I honestly havenâ€™t had anything faster then 5ms response time and have had zero issues with it. But, that is me and what I see is most definitely going to be different than what you see."
Youâ€™re right on the phone. Thatâ€™s $40. I put the plan data in the post above.
I have alwaysssssss wanted to see a concert at Red Rocks.  I have the Incubus DVD from their show there a few years back and it looks like the most amazing venue I have ever seen.

Anything by Victoriaâ€™s Secret is typically really good and relatively inexpensive. I also like Michael Kors Sexy Amber.
"Agree with what others have said, Tyler is a great teacher. I learned React way back from a course he had on egghead. Not only did I learn react but the course had you first build an app in ES5 then convert it to ES6 so you got to learn that too, along with webpack in the pre create-react-app days. Was a fantastic resource. Unfortunately I think it's out of date so it's been removed from the site. Can't thank you enough Tyler."
They make the best mouse features but they are not the best in pointing devices. Would have agreed with you a few years ago but the switch quality and power they run them at causes huge problems. If you really want to get into it start googling. Having click issues within a year of purchase is entirely avoidable but they won't do anything about it. Unfortunately Logitech is an empty shell of what they used to be

The astroturfing probably turned some people off to it.
"Moms are so hard to shop for. I think I did alright this year though. She dragged me into this girly shop when she was visiting me a couple months back, and liked 2 things: a decorative vase for $100, and a set of salt and pepper shakers for $60. She said she couldn't get both and elected to get the shakers. Over the past few months, I have accidentally let slip that the store closed (locally owned, I said the owners moved out of state). She was so sad. Unbeknownst to her, I bought the vase from the store last week."

"I find it quite funny how me as an avid tabletop collector and gamer have played maybe a handful of the top 100 and of those I have played and know from the list, none of these fit my genre of board game.

I own around 100 games (will try and update my BGG collection for accuracy) and I've really pushed away Euro games, worker placement, set collection, etc. games that are all on this list."
"* Hyperion by Dan Simmons
* Diaspora by Greg Egan
* Starfish by Peter Watts
* House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds
* The Cyberiad by Stanislaw Lem

Hyperion felt like (and sort of is) six books rolled into one. The characters are fantastic and each of their tale fascinating and horrible to varying degrees. It's the only book on my list which I feel is an absolute must read.

Diaspora was surreal and dreamlike. Its themes are (non-romantic) love, humanity, loneliness, loss, and hope. It's difficult to talk about without spoiling it.

Starfish's atmosphere is amazing. It's about a group of outcasts being sent to live at the bottom of the ocean. People usually highlight how creepy the book was, but I found it to be a strangely comforting setting. I still think about it. And I kind of want to move there!

House of Suns is my favorite Reynolds novel. It's fairly optimistic when compared to Revelation Space. This is space opera on a huge scale. There are several scenes in House of Suns that will never leave me (especially the sectioning - yikes). I think it's the go-to novel for people who want to get introduced to Reynolds.

The Cyberiad... I can't describe it. I wouldn't make it justice. It's such a strange collection of stories, far from anything else I've read. It's sad to think how so many books are generic and interchangeable when you know that the potential of the genre is so much greater."

Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan.  THere is 13 books though so be prepared for a long adventure.
