59882,best perfume,Jimmy choo eau de parfum!
24138,best anime,"Everyone has Gurren Lagann - I liked it OK, and it was cute and all.  But great?  Must watch?  Ehh... not really.  

Compare that to the other things on the list and clearly one thing doesn't belong.  Not picking on you, it's on lots of people's list - you just commented most recently :P"
40989,best instrument to play,"the triangle, you just have to know when, thats all"
26219,best politician,Cato the Elder has to be my favorite Cato. Carthago delenda est!
47274,best state to visit in the United States,"Philly!!! I love Philly/Baltimore because they’re a better representation of the east coast vibe than NYC (because as OP said, that’s a whole different world). Boston, too."
51826,best iphone case,Try Bullstrap leather cases.
44651,best items under $100,"Sonicare tooth brush - like getting a cleaning done every time I brush my teeth. Also whitened my smile.

Bidet - I honestly don’t know how people can live without one of these. The rest of the world has these built in

Good skin care routine - started in my late 20s, and wish I started sooner 

A good knife - makes my life much easier. I got a good knife set for under $100 when it was a deep sale 

Performance underwear (Saxx) - much more comfortable, holds my junk in place, and durable. 

High quality bed sheets - I love rubbing my feet on them before I sleep.

I mostly buy all these when they are on a great sale, thanks to redflagdeals"
42535,best detective show,"The Wire
Bosch
The Shield
Sopranos"
9374,best toothpaste,9/10 dentists would reccomend Oral-B pro-health to a friend. The 10th has social skills and doesn't discuss the pros and cons of toothpaste brands with his friends.
66570,best soccer team in the world,"Uh... what's the word... Real... Madrid? I think? .-.

Their bench can easily win titles in another countries."
66428,best soccer team in the world,Maalen?
8299,best toothpaste,"One of greatest benefits IMO is just that it goes for 2 minutes, and a lot will beep every 30 seconds. It ensures you brush long enough and helps you get each side evenly.

Also in my case, I tended to brush too hard. Electrics help with that too."
56108,best action and adventure movie,"Star Wars

Edit: downvoted because Star Wars isn't one of my favourite adventure movies?"

32492,best vacation resort,Looking at Cabo San Lucas now. Looks like the safest weather-wise.
1870,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Round Table is so good. Rusty's isn't ;(  No recommendation. All of our pizza is pretty gross here. Had to comment because I just can't let the Round Table comparison go unchecked!

13426,best spreadsheet editor,"I think this may set me on path to figuring this out, at very least for our windows users (who happen to be the ones who need this the most!)

I’ll see if they can get to this and I’ll let you know how it goes, thanks again :)"
20372,best workout music,I was finding cardio mind numbingly boring and kept skipping it until I started listening to podcasts.  Now I actually look forward to them when I know I have good episodes in my playlist
22243,best celebrity,(Sir) Patrick Stewart. So eloquent. So bald. So... sexy.
35300,best alcoholic drink,"Your boyfriend and his friends are dumb. No one spends the extra money on Tito’s for a party unless they really want Tito’s. No one buys liquor in glass bottles for parties either (at least not a second time), and I’ve never seen Tito’s in plastic."
