What sites online are reputable that carry it?
"Cabin in the woods ,pandorum"
"Can Confirm. The swim up bar is dangerous to gingers (who spend 6 hours in it drinking...in the sun). Housekeeping was more than happy to replace every towel in the room, which was used to clean up the mess. A large tip was left.

Oh, and liquor dispensers in the room! 

The nightly shows are also a lot of fun. There was a vendor there that made these beautiful fingerpaintings on tile of the signature Cabo rock formation. I bought 2 of them, and they're hanging up in my office.

The Steakhouse there has one of the best pieces of cooked meat I've ever had."
"[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/browse/frameworks/react) also has a large amount of free react courses - in the format I like screencasts to be...very fast and concise.

When I was starting out with Redux and testing react apps I found the tutorials to be very helpful, not sure how good the entry-level course is...but Kent Dodds is a good instructor."
Fidel Castro or Salvador Allende.
Huh. I got through the first two volumes of The Reality Dysfunction series and lost interest due to fragmented plot and an onslaught of woo-woo. I take it this one follows through?
"BS, he’s as corporate as they come"
"You know how some things from your childhood just wind up etched on your brain?

*""I was just a child when the stars fell from the skies. But I remember how they built a cannon to destroy them, and in turn, how that cannon brought war upon us...*

The recent AC games are an embarrassment."

"Dornsife posted on their instagram story a few months back that the top 5 most popular Dornsife majors are Economics, Psychology, Human Biology, Political Science,  and Biological Sciences. Don't know about the rest of the school though."
"Mine is Midnight Marauders (in general). I have lot's of love for Hieroglyphics/Souls of Mischief/Del tha Funky Homosapien though (The Pharcyde is great too).

Back to the topic: I pick 93 til infinity it was the first album I heard by Hiero/Souls and it just stuck with me. I personally enjoy Full circle more then 3rd eye vision (will listen to 3rd eye tonight though)."
"Be prepared for a shit storm of work. I'm studying for the CPA right now and it's more work than anything I did in college (and that says a lot). Accounting is a lot of work and even more work in the real world, but it can be rewarding"

"You know that’s how *concepts* work, right?"
"Mont Blanc Legend is my sort and I also love Gucci Guilty. As other mentionned, a perfume is a memory trigger. Go around and smell them, you can even ask for little sample bottles which last for a few nights, it really gives you the experience !"
"I've been making banana oat pancakes lately, they only take about 5-10 minutes.  All you really need is a banana, 1/3C of oats and an egg, but I like to add pecans or walnuts, some cinnamon, pinch of salt, baking powder for a little leavening, and some vanilla extract.  Only takes a minute longer, but you can add or pare down to your taste and convenience.  Just blend up the oats to a powder, add banana, egg, whatever else you want, blend to a batter consistency and fry up like any other pancake.

It's best if you let the batter rest for five minutes, I use that time to make tea and empty the drain rack, but it's not a big deal if you cook them right away if you have no time.  If you preheat your pan while you're making batter, you can have a hot, balanced breakfast in 5 minutes."
"I thought I was going to be the type of person who bought a bunch of cheapo sunglasses and just went through them, but with my dear MIL's influence I now somehow have two pairs of Chanel sunglasses. These are also the only Chanel items I own.

I have a black pair. [I can't find a better photo online unfortunately.](https://www.google.ca/search?q=CHANEL+5303H+Simply+Pearl+Collection&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX8v_wr5zTAhVl4YMKHT3sAr4Q_AUICCgB&biw=1366&bih=604#imgrc=GFJG0bMJ4oUODM:)

And I have a brown pair. [Again, I can't find a better photo, also I'm 99% sure these are it, but I'm not sure.](https://www.google.ca/search?q=chanel+pearl+sunglasses&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwi2-dq5r5zTAhWBzIMKHWMdD2UQ_AUIBigB&biw=1366&bih=604#tbm=isch&q=chanel+bijoux+sunglasses+brown&imgrc=FNRAXwXXNslmlM:)

I haven't really felt like I needed to buy anymore."
I fucking live Rusty’s. Nothing like a Rusty’s pizza with pepperoni and olives with an ice cold beer.
Fallout 4 isn't the best but it's one of the few AAA RPGs this gen.
BG3 early access just released!
"Thank you. Very useful to me, since I use Nvidia cards."
Someone's going to rip that whole site with a script today I bet.
"Sure, but that doesnt really mean anything in an all time XI as players cant be pulled from different eras."
