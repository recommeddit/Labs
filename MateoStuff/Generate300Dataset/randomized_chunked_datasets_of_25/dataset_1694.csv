6471,best Netflix documentary,"zeitgeist: moving forward - A feature length documentary work which presents a case for a needed transition out of the current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which governs the entire world society. This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical ""life ground"" attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a ""Resource-Based Economy""

surviving progress - Humanity's ascent is often measured by the speed of progress. But what if progress is actually spiraling us downwards, towards collapse? Ronald Wright, whose best-seller, A Short History Of Progress inspired SURVIVING PROGRESS, shows how past civilizations were destroyed by ""progress traps"" - alluring technologies and belief systems that serve immediate needs, but ransom the future. As pressure on the world's resources accelerates and financial elites bankrupt nations, can our globally-entwined civilization escape a final, catastrophic progress trap? With potent images and illuminating insights from thinkers who have probed our genes, our brains, and our social behaviour, this requiem to progress-as-usual also poses a challenge: to prove that making apes smarter isn't an evolutionary dead-end.

samsara - Filmed over nearly five years in twenty-five countries on five continents, and shot on seventy-millimetre film, Samsara transports us to the varied worlds of sacred grounds, disaster zones, industrial complexes, and natural wonders.

the house i live in - From the dealer to the narcotics officer, the inmate to the federal judge, a penetrating look inside America's criminal justice system, revealing the profound human rights implications of U.S. drug policy.

the imposter - A documentary centered on a young Frenchman who claims to a grieving Texas family that he is their 16-year-old son who has been missing for 3 years."
10970,best backpack for college,"I do like the simple look of them, but they seem a little big for my needs"
53480,best usb c charging cable,I got a 10ft OtterBox. I use it for my MacBook as well as my Pixel.
15878,best sunglasses for fashion,"Persols are all around great. Aesthetically they look good, but they also offer UV protection, solid lens quality and they're pretty well built. Like I said in my comment, the travel pairs have issues with the screws from what I've seen, but overall, they're great glasses. They definitely make you stand out."
59644,best perfume,"In no particular order

1) mugler-aura

71234,best movies with a cool twist,"Man you just reminded me of when I was 11 and on my way to the theater with my sister to watch the movie. Some asshats in front of me walking down the street were talking really loud and one of them says ""so Sam Jackson was actually the terrorist the whole time???""

It took me like 10 seconds to figure out the movie and I was so goddamn angry. Fuck you lady!"
61881,Best RPG game on PS4,"I don't disagree at all, but I would say the same is true for JRPGs.  At least these days, I don't think simply ""RPG made in Japan"" is necessarily true.  Japan sometimes makes more western style RPGs and other countries make more JRPG style games.  

Cosmic Star Heroine, for example, is 100% a JRPG to me despite being developed by a US studio."
57491,best water brand,"Tbh I have no idea what TDS content means but I dislike fiji water because transport and distribution in the US is such a long way and produces a lot of pollution, plus it‘s just too expensive.

Evian is perfect for me because I live in switzerland and it‘s source is on the french border to lake geneva, literally just around the corner compared to fiji. I mean I‘m drinking tap water 95% of the time, but I like to minimize my carbon footprint, especially if it‘s as easy as investing 15 minutes into water research."
70997,best movies with a cool twist,Oh I will.  I've heard how bad the American version was.
46684,best hand santizer brand,I think when the schools stopped supplying it and forcing the teachers to buy it out of their own money. It’s pretty shitty in my opinion. I don’t mind doing it for the teachers. They shouldn’t have to provide that out of their own salary.
10172,best pencil for drawing,"I've not had much luck with General's pencils, the cores always seem to have gritty bits in them that I find particularly jarring when I'm writing. 

For an American made pencil I don't think you can beat Musgrave's new Tennessee Reds, with a dark smooth core and red cedar slats, they are a treat to the eye and the nose!"
56500,best desktop monitor,"Thanks for this! I went with the [LG 27GL850](https://reddlink.tech/amazon-lg-27gl850), beautiful monitor."
14426,best romantic novel,Ohhhh Lord Ian. I forgot that one on my list.
8423,best toothpaste,"Because of shady patenting on NovaMin and all Bioglass, an enamel repairing innovation that Americans have missed out on due to this.

Only get it shipped from Canada or overseas specifically with NovaMin, otherwise there's no point to the price."
15221,best tree for the garden,I would go for a Magnolia
28805,best breakfast foods,Boil extra eggs and use them for several days.
65927,best college in california,"True, but I was thinking more of Cal's longtime reputation of being known as the ""compulsive protestor"" and ultra liberal school since the 60s. Not necessarily the recent violence. I've visited the bay and berkeley quite a few times, enough to know it's normal on most days, but definitely wacky relative to other schools/cities. Lol

33573,best electric car,"I’m absolutely uninterested in the argument about 0-60 times, it doesn’t make any difference to me.

Numpty is a bit like calling someone a clown. Not very constructive!"
40816,best instrument to play,I dont get it.

8690,best toothpaste,My wife had this reaction to it.

36028,best alcoholic drink,I view it as a bicep curl variant.
28604,best breakfast foods,"*Is lunch. 

FTFY"
55698,best action and adventure novel series,*Armor* by John Steakley is probably near the top of the list.
