11203,best backpack for college,"I use a Datsusara backpack. They primarily aim towards martial arts/MMA markets but when I'm not using it to carry my BJJ gi to the gym I use it as my everyday bag. 

It's made from hemp so it's as tough as you like and because hemp has anti bacterial properties it does help your bag from getting stunk out by gym gear etc. also has a laptop slot in it too."
4261,best text editor,"If you're asking this in the context of ""I need an editor that I can quickly download/use in various places"", Notepad++ is very good.

Otherwise, it's still good but you'll be noticing some of the annoyances in it (like hanging on big files)."
55371,best action and adventure novel series,"Company of Strangers by Melissa McShane is a fun book. It’s a pretty basic premise, strangers group up to go explore some ruins. 

The Copper Promise by Jen Williams - three adventurers try to figure out what’s going on and explore some ruins. 

Also, check out Barrayar by Lois McMaster Bujold. That kicks off the Miles Vorkosigan books and that is some of the absolute best character driven space opera out there."

28501,best breakfast foods,"> followed by two minutes to peel

What's your trick?

I swear I've tried everything (and I've tried in different countries, too, in case American eggs are weird) but I can never peel an egg I've boiled in anything short of a minute apiece, with lots of shards and flakes and general annoyance.

Meanwhile, boiled eggs in hotels always peel flawlessly."
