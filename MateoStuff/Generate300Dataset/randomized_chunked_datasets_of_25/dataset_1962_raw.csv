"Not gonna lie, I watched just about the first 40 minutes of the first episode and felt like it just wasnâ€™t as interesting as I was hoping it would be. 

Does it get any better after the first episode? Think itâ€™s worth going back and finishing up?"
"I'm a fan of the [Wallet app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid4you.application.wallet) . It'll require premium for collaboration. I've never used collaboration, but it is included in the premium subscription."
"This is a very informative comment!

If possible, I'd highly recommend the two care shuttle, it's the best way to hike anything in the Northeast because like this poster hinted at, good loops are damn near impossible to find."
"He's good with the cats. He is best friends with my male cat. My cat has been very loving toward him since birth and he is very gentle. He has a lot of contact with different animals (dogs, cats, chickens, horses, goats and cows) so I've always taught himbthe to gently touch animals. He's always looking for the cats and wanting to give them affection.

Our entire property is wide open. 6 acres and no fences at all."
"Canadian here with two physical newspaper subscriptions, a daily one to the Globe and Mail that I'm thankful for each morning, and a weekend subscription to the Toronto Star that I'm considering axing. Used to actually buy the Toronto SUN nearly every day until they (a) put most of their paper free online and then (b) took most of the content I enjoyed out of the physical copy."
Holy crap I bet that was good
"Yeah, I've seen a lot of linux tutorials where the guy is using kali and he's from vietnam/china/cambodia"
"Turo is still banned in all of New york state since 2013 :(

I'd test drive something every other weekend if I could"
What are your priorities that made you go for the Pro then? The telephoto?
This was one of my first CD's.  An absolute iconic rap album.
Nice hard game 4Pillars:  [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/4pillars/id1364450813](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/4pillars/id1364450813) thats free with no ads! Fun boss fights as well :P
"Silver and  red are pretty commonly used especially on FPS's
I prefer the silvers but I would try them out before ordering a board with them because they can feel too light and awkward to use."
"Steve Irwin hands down, I've met a few musicians and athletes who have been nice but none were as nice as Steve. I met him in an elevator at a hotel and I walked in soaking wet after swimming in the pool. I was only 11 and I was in awe that I was in an elevator with Steve Irwin. Straight away he starts a conversation with me, asks me what my name is, where I'm from and if there were any crocs in the pool and if I see any at the hotel to come find him. He then starts talking to the hotel worker who was in the elevator with us and staring at Steve the whole time. That interaction with him still makes me ridiculously happy whenever I think about it."
"Thanks, even I wanted to do this but always wondered, what if I drift too far after pulling my cords! Will they teach us to control our descent?"
"Nah, I don't mind investing some money into things like this.  
Would I get a 300 color set of copic markers right away, that would indeed be unreasonable. But a few good pencils, pens and maybe a dozen markers, I think that's something you can risk. :P"
"If it said ""greatest rock albums of all time"" this would be less annoying. I mention jazz because, in my opinion at least, it lends itself to the format of full length albums very well."
It's still Burnout Paradise.
"Speed is one of the first things to go, my dude! Hopefully Jackson can keep evolving his game, because I like the guy, but it's pretty delusional to think he can continue to play that way in the long term. 

Let's just enjoy it while it lasts."
Do u use a premade template?
"No problem at all. They have a couple other designs on amazon, not sure if they have the same number of reviews but seems like most are at or close to 5 stars."
Was thinking the same.
You're taking an internet guide about the perception of Halloween candy much too seriously ðŸ™„
How is the orange and saddle (?) so pristine? Itâ€™s got no patina lol
Itâ€™s honestly cheaper than i would expect
We dutch mastered the water in every  way possible. (:
