63597,I’m on chimera 1.0.8 on A12 so Cydia is broken for me. I tried Sileo and it doesn’t have the features that Cydia or zebra have like adding multiple sources at once or the scrubber to quickly scroll through packages. Plus there’s a built in dark mode making it the ultimate package manager. It seems far ahead of sileo not to mention the controversy with Sileo and BigBoss.,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit

* **5 Hour Energy** - This is my favorite. The small size makes it easy to down quickly and I can store them easily. The energy kicks in in about a half hour. It is gradual and effective. I d not get jittery on it, it simply wakes me up. The come down is also gradual.

* **Monster** - I like this for the taste. It provides pretty good energy but it is not as smooth as 5 Hour.

* **Red Bull** - Good balance of flavor and energy. However, I have had panic attacks on this for some reason.

* **Red Jak** - Best tasting I think. I just do not get a very effective energy boost from this one.",best energy drink

7626,"I could really use some help! The last time I bought a computer or laptop was 15 years ago. I've since gotten hand-me-downs from family members. I need a laptop that's great for school, work, and occasionally gaming such as Skyrim or League of Legends. I can afford around $1000 for initial cost plus or minus for accessories.  I've never owned a Mac but I'm not opposed to it if a one is a better choice/ value than windows.

I realize Rice is always considered the best receiver/player of all time, but Hutson was so dominant for his time and essentially created the modern receiver position as we know it.
