just call me H. Clinton. Giving everyone what they want to hear.
"Primer would fall into that category a bit I think, right?"
"One point on the safari, it is driven through for the time being.  I would definitely try to do it on the way into the park."
I have a Belkin one I've been using since I got my Moto Z Play back in 2017. Worked fine ever since.
"Oh yeah, I know they do a lot of workshops, I was simply referring to the age of what is up there for past content, not the quality. A lot of stuff is from 2018 or even older, especially for the basic HTML/CSS/Javascript stuff.

The instructor resume is definitely the biggest reason why I signed up... and I definitely hear you about the length of Udemy courses, one of the JS courses I dived into was 60 hours long.

I will say I definitely like the teacher/classroom learning style a lot more than the video watchalongs of places like Udemy. I've only done Jen Kramer's advanced CSS courses so far and I'm pretty excited to jump into Brian Holt's new React workshop after it goes live."
"I like sensodyne because it doesn't burn when I use it (most of them do), but nobody seems to like the taste of it when kissing them"
But green isn't a creative color
"Dude, that's actually really unhealthy. Go brush your teeth man. You could get gum disease or some shit."
Yeah. Weird phase but you can only act in roles offered to you. My point is that he has the talent and execution to make his roles memorable. Everything else (including some movie choices) is questionable.

From Ohio and never seen or heard of Mars.

"They'll post that, and then the next day complain about pedophiles"
"I just couldn't get in to the British The Office. One of my least favorite episodes of the American one is the pilot, which is near identical to the British pilot. I guess I just don't like British sitcoms. I did like Red Dwarf, though."
Pride & Prejudice!! Mr. Darcy sets an impossibly high standard. Anything by Jane Austen is great in general
Great list! I think *R for Data Science* is vastly underappreciated. I just assigned it to my new hire to help her get up to speed on data science.
"This was the past. Most filters work on the network level now.

Filters to hide elements are applied too to cover up empty areas left behind by the failed ad. They are considered ""cosmetic"" filters and can be turned off for whatever bizarre reason you might have.

The advantage over DNS level blocking is that it works for sites that deliver ad-code and tracking scripts from their main domain."
"I'd agree with that. 

Old Man's War fits in the same place Dresden Files does personally. There are some neat ideas, the world is cool, and the writing gets the point across and is occasionally witty/funny. 

They're the ""summer action movie"" in book form. And they're fun for that."
"As it stand right now I wouldn't want an EV. Range can still be an issue, as is charging the cars. I live in the countryside, my town has a grand total of three chargers. None of these are of the high speed kind so getting a full charge will take some patience. Even with superchargers like Tesla you still have to be willing to wait some time, at the risk of your batterylife. 

There is also the issue of how long the battery will last. In the end an EV has the same battery as your phone or laptop. While it will last longer, it will start to degrade. Can an EV live to be 15 years old without needing new batteries? 

If I had to chose I'd think hybrids are better for now. PHEV's just seem like a clunky in between stage."
Finally dismiss Smith and Gilly walks in.
Guardians of the Galaxy 2 by a fucking MILE.
"Not likely. Oatmeal is the US term for porridge, and 'biscuits' are totally a totally different food over here and not breakfast materials unless you're 12 or having an 'I'm not an adult and I can call in sick and hide in a  pillow fort if I want' kind of day."

White rum pairs better with fruit but warm gin by itself works as a no-hassle replacement of breakfast/lunch/dreams/dinner.
all of them
