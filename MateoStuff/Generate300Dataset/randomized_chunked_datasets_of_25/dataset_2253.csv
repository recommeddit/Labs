60222,"I think they are worth it.  But I would strongly recommend to buy it brand new and *not* used.  This is because the newer models are energy star compliant and every year they make more energy efficient models.  If you buy used, you will probably be buying someone else's headaches and have a higher electric bill.

Chest freezers hold more and have a lower profile and so can be put underneath cellar stairs and in other places that have otherwise unusable space.

The down side is that they can quickly become an open sewer of leftovers with freezer ziplock bags cast asunder and every which way with some plummeting to the very bottom of the chest where you will never see it again.  

If you put in any type of organizational partitions, those eat up room, but you can find your stuff quicker and more easily.

The other downside is that it has this nice flat lid on it that is a magnet for stuff to be put on that empty space.  Then, you have to clear it off every time you want to get into it.  

I have a chest freezer and despite the downsides, I like it.  I like the smaller footprint, the increased storage space and the fact that if I slightly overload it and the lid pops up, I can simply put a paint can on the lid to hold it down.  

Also, you don't have to worry too much about these when the power goes out since they are full of frozen items.  As long as you don't open it up, your stuff will pretty much stay somewhat frozen if the power is out for less than 24 hours.

Since you are vegetarians, you might be better served with a pressure canner -- they are slightly cheaper than chest freezers and you are not paying electricity to freeze/chill/maintain your garden produce or even cooked meals.

I will pressure can my chicken stock, tomatoes, green beans etc. and save my freezer for my raw meat that I buy in bulk. If you eat lots of frozen vegetables versus growing your own, then perhaps the chest freezer would be the way to go.

62495,"What left-ball-sack said. Skyrim, I don't know. I liked it when it was relatively new and I hadn't played many other games, but it's not that amazing. RPG is a broad spectrum of games, though. If you ejoy the process of looting and leveling, give Dark Souls a go. I thought I wouldn't like it, and I think most dark souls players thought the same thing, but it's a masterpiece. If not that, then Horizon Zero Dawn for sure.",Best RPG game on PS4
