Just got a whiff of this yesterday and can agree that it's a very nice scent
If you like things a little darker: Shameless.

"They don't, but they have to authorize transferring to different majors outside of the college. I was originally an engineering major going into math, but she practically forced me to stay in the information and engineering college under a CS major"
"Curious.  Does your test piece silent alarm, or alarm and alert the thief as well? Couldn't the suspect claim they ""accidentally"" opened the mail\package, or the package was already open\loose, and got rustled?"

Yup....damn,  I google searched and EVERYTHING."
"I've yet to find a Bartender who knows how to make an Aviation.  That is to say, they have never heard of it."
Vol. 2 is very underrated. It complements Vol. 1 very well.
I make burritos too! But I make hash browns and chop up bacon in the raw egg mix then pour it into the pan when the hash browns are crispy and scramble everything together and put it in a wrap.
"I really need to revisit Grand Soir. I remember preferring the other MFKs to it, but I think it's one that may really need more time to grow. It has such a lovely name, too."
Espresso martini. It's my fave but I can't sleep if I drink lots of them. I like most cocktails to be fair.
"I mean this is pretty overkill for anyone without high caries risk. Your standard 1000 ish ppm supermarket toothpaste is going to be fine for most people. Its more how you brush that determines if you are more likely to get decay or not. For most, the 5000ppm toothpaste is just a waste of money."
Tbh. No one. East coast had it locked
"I’ve been wanting to watch that one, but I’ll have to find a good time since the movie is like 10 hours long."

">So why would this be different when combined with a toothpaste?

Enamel is pretty hard, it is possible that something less hard than tooth enamel is used as an abrasive in certain applications. That being said, it looks as though the consensus is that baking soda is abrasive to tooth enamel."
"Well, not really. If I recall correctly (it's been a while since I read the book) Schrodinger is really talking about statistical mechanics which, despite having the word statistics in the title, is not really related to the statistics dearsomething is talking about. The statistics dearsomething is talking about is more the statistical testing of hypothesis (p-values and null hypothesis and whatnot) which appears absolutely no where in statistical mechanics. Heck even statistical mechanics makes very little use of the field of statistics. As Wikipedia suggests, it would be better called probability mechanics since it uses more ideas from that but, even then, it is rather limited. Also, keep in mind his book was was written 70 years ago when interpretations were very different and nowadays most physicists understand the probabilistic nature of the universe. However that's a debate for another day for the subtleties involved.

This type of statistics more refers experimentalists going into the lab and doing statistical analysis on data to confirm or deny a hypothesis. Unfortunately my knowledge of this is about just above zero since it was briefly discussed when I took my horrible statistics classes (why is statistics always taught so poorly? This seems to be universal, much to my dismay!)"

Thanks for the advice (this whole thread is great) but Sausage has some of the most absurdly cringe marketing I’ve ever seen. Depp dressed up like he’s 23 riding a motorbike around the desert with 38 silver bangles when in actual fact he’s 53 or whatever. God I find it so ridiculous.
"They just added the other seasons too. 3 is kind of a lull but important for the later ones. I know it's not Netflix, but damn that show is great at making me laugh."

"The word ""soccer"" is actually British. It comes from the name, association football, with the ""soc"" bit taken from the word ""association""

read up, actually quite interesting

"A majority of devs i’ve talked to highly recommend Javascript. I know javascript but i mainly prefer using ruby and rails, but i can agree its a really big trend in the way of js"
"> Would you be interested in being a mod for a reddit for Diablo Valley College?  

I thought you were offering to make me a mod so that's why I asked.  Perhaps I misread?"
