Agreed! Half baked is second best.
Unique Pizza - Noemi’s - very good
I would be grumpy too if I lived in Sweden. All the free healthcare in the world won't save you from that dreaded winter depression.

##Anomolies

* Cosmic Encounter is 1977, 1991, 2000, and 2008 - I believe most are referring to the 2008 edition so I used that.
* Agricola was 2007, Agricola Revised was 2016 - with only minor game play differences I went with the original as I suspect many reviewers don't distinguish the two.
* Pandemic Legacy Season 1 and 2 had an a/b listing (making this technically a list of 101 games) - and though they are fairly different in implementation I lumped them together and used Season 1's 2015 date over Season 2's 2017 date.
* Trajan has a 1991 and 2011 release - but I doubt any of the reviewers means the 1991 Strategy & Tactics magazine game.
* Santorini has a 2004 self-published release and a 2016 release, and I suspect most are thinking of the cartoony artwork version of this abstract game.

##Personal Analysis

In terms of this subreddit, divide up gaming into 3 major epochs right now:

* pre-modern games (before Magic/Catan or about 1993 to 1995)
* modern gaming (at or after Magic/Catan or about 1993 to 1995)
* kickstarter modern gaming (at or after kickstarter and its platform growth, around 2009 to 2011)... maybe I should call this post-modern game design. ;p

The years are ""fuzzy"" and I normally say 1995 and 2009; but during these transitional windows you had games of the older design school and the newer design school simultaneously existing.

Using those division, all top 10 games are Kickstarter Modern Games (not meaning they launched on Kickstarter, but that they were released once Kickstarter became a major force in the board gaming market and brought in new design styles via crowdfunding).  Even the top 25 are almost all from this (4 titles outside of the epoch, but just by a year).  Only 1 game is pre-modern, and that is **Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective**, a game that is mostly the same and only had minor changes to content and components over the decades.

Another way to look at it is:

* 4% of the top 100 are from last year (probably too new of a year to have many claim top titles from 2019)
* 15% is from the prior 2 years
* 30% are from the prior 3 years
* 43% are from the prior 4 years
* 59% are from the prior 5 years
* 68% are from the prior 6 years (a full 2/3 of ""top rated"" games by these critics are from 2014 on)
* 87% are from the Kickstarter modern game epoch
* 1% are in the pre-modern game epoch
* 12% are in the modern game epoch

Seeing this data I wonder how much is design and component quality improvement, how much is improved marketing and market growth, and how much is reviewer age bias (ie, tending to be younger and not experiencing some of the older games because they weren't flashy enough).

I've already seen an effect online where a person gets into the hobby and all the new game styles they encounter over the next few years are great; but then novelty wears off and they start recognizing common mechanisms and find games 3-5 years after they got into the hobby to be ""hyped"" (while new gamers find them stunningly innovative). So many reviewers also rode the rise of social media and YouTube, and that boom time was post-2009; is it fairly possible that their immersion into the hobby during the rise of this new media influenced their preferences?  What would the boardgame landscape have looked like (and ratings) if most encontered games in the mid-90s or mid-00s and then became big reviewers?

Anyway, I'd also urge caution on drawing any conclusions from such a simple analysis of data. It is just interesting tidbits to consider when looking at a wider array of elements.  Now it will be interesting to see what impact COVID-19 will have on the hobby in the next coming decade, as I think that might start another shift in the hobby (more towards having digital options to play or methods to play physical games remotely - you know, like how people used to play chess by mailing each other their moves as they play over months)."
It's a pretty classic story in the Greek tradition.  Vengeance and hubris lead to destruction.
It's just that I don't agree with it at all...
"It's not about breaking in.

 Ever had a broken zipper or your jeans?"
"Smarter Every Day should be part of your science channel list

Other than that some really great recommendations!!!"
"Axios does not handle https proxying to http easily, while others lib does that fine. Let’s ditch axios."
"My go to is egg-in-the-hole (egg in a basket, blah blah, whatever you call it) because it's stupid fast and delicious. Other than that, if I have more time, it's a frittata in the cast iron. Impressive results, totally a no-brainer to make."
"Somalia is actually pretty awesome, nothing shit about it."
"I once downloaded from the site you mentioned, but in my experience, it was filled with ads, and it was hell downloading from them. I recommend the sites:

https://macdrop.net

https://www.macbed.com

They also post TNT team cracks, and out of the two, I recommend macdrop."
So what pillow do you have ?
I use my ENO single nest for camping. Instead of a tent I set up my hammock & a bug net/tarp & it’s amazing
Hey sorry to bother you again but I ordered the hp envy 13 that you posted in your big list in the 2nd highest price point. Is that the same hp envy that you linked to hps site to the guy above ? I want to make sure I ordered the better one if they’re not the same.
"Aren't pizza's everywhere expensive? They use to be the cheapest thing to eat in college, lived on them back in the day. Now you would have to take out a student loan before ordering.

I make my own, for pennies, best in town."
"If you're coming from a HTML & CSS, Sass background, starting with Gatsby, Styled Components & Polished could be a way to go. 

As web designer you can immediately *see* why it can be useful and use your existing skills to create stuff, just with React added for convenience. The're many Gatsby starters and their source code that you can study.
You may not want to start with webapps and the ""boring"" stuff most React courses teach, but just create more interactive websites or landing pages and enhance your existing skills first."

"Only on 10 series and newer cards, hope that means it works for you!"
"Disaronno was the first liquor I could drink strait, its like Dr. Peppers laid back sister.


EDIT: Or pehaps Dr. Pepper's distractingly attractive assistant."
"My roommate last year had this fucking rad desk lamp. I wish I had one too. It's basically a lamp that keeps the light where it should be, it doesn't light up the room at all, just the desk. 

EDIT: My roommate had what OP posted."
Community is good
"Seriously. My 4-year-old would be devastated if I told her she's not my BFF; she says I'm hers everyday. Then again, pretty much everyone is her BFF, so there's that."
I totally agree. I'm in the middle of a rewatch with my son and we are now halfway through season 9. Just not the same without Jack.
Never heard of that.  Care to teach me what its about?
