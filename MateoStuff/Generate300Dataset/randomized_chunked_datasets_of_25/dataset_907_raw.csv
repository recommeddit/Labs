My daughter is learning to play the bass guitar and I suggested she listen to a few of their songs to get a different perspective on what can be done with a bass than the one she was getting listening to more modern groups. She's now a massive fan.

"Just noticed this post because it's the top-voted post of the last 30 days.

Coincidentally, I just today posted in /r/javascript about an AJAX library I've been writing, here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/cqa5xm/ive_been_writing_an_immutablestyle_ajax_library/

The reason I started working on that library is that I've been a [contributor](https://github.com/axios/axios/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Acodeclown) to axios and experienced the current unstable state first-hand.

I think there are a few concrete problems with axios:

- lack of active PR reviewers and mergers, as discussed
- testing setup which is fragile (I've fixed [one issue](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/1475)), as also discussed
- design decision of configuring everything via a huge nested object => causes reference and thus security hazards (should be [fixed](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/1395) now) and is not easy to memorize
- design decision, to continue on above bulletpoint, it used to be a feature that you could set global defaults and affect everything, causing [security hazards](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/385)
- design decision of fitting node and browser support into the same library => causes overly complex testing setup, and also as a principle I would not recommend using the same library in both environments in order to prevent accidental leakage of secrets to the client

So yeah, that's why I wrote [yea](https://github.com/codeclown/yea) which could be an interesting alternative for axios and fetch etc. I've explained [here](https://github.com/codeclown/yea/blob/master/COMPARISON.md) my motivation about why not just use fetch."
"I mean there are some ‘healthier’ energy drinks, but most of them probably don’t have the caffeine/energy boost you are looking for. Zevia Energy uses a 0 calorie natural sweetener called Stevia instead of artificial stuff like sucralose, but it only has 120mg / can. There’s also a decently popular brand called Celsius that is generally considered healthier (200mg / can). There’s also some really really low caffeine drinks that are generally healthy like Bai (55mg / can)."
Of course you should

Fucking jokingly!
"Also because if you drink RO or DI water there's such little other stuff in it that when it goes into your body your cells will equilibrate with it and ions will move out of your cells into the water. So it can be unhealthy for you.

Edit: this is probably an old wives tale I'd heard."
