"I'm not sure I'd read that the same way. As someone who has been in the labor market for a couple of decades, I'd agree that STEM graduates tend to have a higher starting salary and employment rate than ""soft skills"" graduates. However, it's also been my experience than ""soft skills"" graduates (albeit ones that have entered a professional career) have a better success rate than STEM graduates. 

Before everyone gets their panties in a wad, this is only my perspective given my experience as a hiring manager in the consulting field. Probably different inn different industries."
"I occasionally catch the more recent episodes, i think they are pretty good, definitely have the Midsomer Murders feel to them. But John Nettles' Barnaby was just the best."

Windscribe is actually really good and is free

Vodka with Sprite. It tastes like sprite and gets the job done. And as long as you dont go full alcoholic you wont get a hangover.

"Some more love for Hyperion here. That story is very engaging and very well put, and it's such an awesome exploration of many of the Sci-Fi genres as well! I especially recommend it to anyone looking to discover what Sci-Fi is about. 

One day, I'll forget enough about it. One day..."
"Tbh after the past two decades I would have even been cool with 12th in the position, this is awesome."
"The Wire is my favourite show of all time. Recently, Dark on Netflix is also worth a watch. Edgy vibe like True Detective. Really recommend it"
I just flossed because of this. Actually.

Honestly there isnt much difference between the tooth pastes as the big companies would like you to believe.  I do recommend one with flouride though (don't buy into the anti-flouride hype people, facebook science is not science).  What is most important is the mechanical action that your brushing is doing to break up the bio film created by the bacteria on your teeth.  Good oral hygiene is achieved by **mechanical methods** not chemical methods as much.  
Now this doesn't mean you need to brush hard, quite the opposite, get a soft bristle brush, brush in little circles with a 45 degree angle with the brush on your gums and tooth for best results. 

Brush 2 times per day.  Have a routine, don't just brush like a wild man, go from quadrant to quadrant.

Floss once a day.

*Pro tip*!:  Hate flossing?  Takes up too much of your time before bed?  Simple, floss while you watch TV or when you are relaxing at any other time in the day.  That way it won't feel like such a chore."

"We most definitely do. Whether that is a good or bad thing :)

I think you have the easier task at hand. You will cover most of our colonial history in an evening :) Indigenous history might be a little trickier :)"
