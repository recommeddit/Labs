"Gibson Les Paul plugged into a 1968 Marshall Lead with a nice crisp amount of fuzz, from a Big Muff or something similar."
boku no picco - 10/10 would watch forever
"Redditors by definition are atypical in their amount of play - most people buy board games as an aspiration rather than with a specific plan to play.

It’s just like how on average, most people who buy a video game don’t actually reach the end (and iirc up to 25% play one time or less)."
"What's the difference between /r/HardScience and /r/Scientific ?  I swear that's exactly what HardScience is (though checking its side panel seems to be empty), so I guess someone could post to trashy blogs there though I've never seen it done."
I like AI reader
"> majority of fans and critics alike agree that Infinity War is the superior film

It's cool how it takes 16 albums from #1 for it to not be a list of white people rock music.
"Highschool dxd, mightiest disciple kenichi,clannad&after story,katanagatari,yu yu hakusho, & naruto. If you can find one you like out of that list you don't like anime."
they literally designed it to be instagrammable. the owners went around every asian restaurant in LA for months and stole all the parts they liked and combined them into that lol
"Or at the least consult with someone who knows what they are doing. And that means an interior designer, not the schmuck behind the counter at home depot. I've worked in a high end paint store part time for a year now and still would not feel confident recommending that, I pass people who want a colour consult off to our people on staff who have design certificates."
"Generally padlocks are to protect your luggage at your accomodation (e.g. a hostel), or when it might be sitting somewhere venerable (e.g. waiting for you in a storage area/sitting on a train etc).
If there's a chance of your zips popping open, it's also worth attaching one. 

If the only place your luggage is venerable is on the plane, and your zips can't pop open, I wouldn't worry about it. If security wants to get in, they'll cut off the padlock."
"he does some work with blockhead.

beautiful disease and break guitars are two old favorites"
"The 11 should last another 4 years and will get another price drop in September after the 13 is announced. I read it has a good battery and has the night mode on the camera, which could prove useful. That is my plan for upgrading next month. That, or a price-dropped 12 mini…"
"Isn't a desk space too valuable to lose on a lamp? I would either hang a lamp over my desk, or use a floor mounted lamp instead. I'd be knocking over a desk lamp all the time and grudge it the footprint is occupies."
"I'm still completely surprised at the comeback of this comic, which at the time was the height of hype and eventually got cancelled because it just wouldn't release new issues.

I loved the design and art (the story was OK, nice but clichéd) but was frankly convinced I had seen the last of Battle Chasers more than a decade ago. And then this. 

Pleasantly blindsided, I was."
"And it funny af, if a little exerstential crisis enducing"
"Curious, is the spectre making a demand for “genuine” or for adequate wattage? My 65W Dell complains when I use my 60W Apple charger but it works. 

I’ve not dealt with the Spectre first hand, though."
Are you looking for one that works with Google Calendar or standalone?

"Right on. Went to an ADTR show last night, it was fucking awesome."
"I love the idea of this, but may I request a new semicolon-ism for those of us who need a dumbed down version?

TI;CR: Too Ignorant; Couldn't Read"
"I just adore Evie Dunmore’s books as well! Her prose is amazing. As much as I love historical inaccuracies a la Tessa Dare, Dunmore’s romances are just elevated because the stakes are so much higher."
oh interesting.  Good tip.
"Speed of opening, speed of navigating through video, hotkey customisation for keyboard and mouse, choosing where to drag and what clicking the screen does, no weird lags or glitches that VLC is plagued with. Mostly speed though. VLC is very slow and especially slow when  scrubbing through a video and speeding up a video is not accurate, like it says x2 but the video is clearly not x2."
