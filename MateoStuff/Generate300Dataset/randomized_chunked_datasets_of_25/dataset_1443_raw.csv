"That's actually quite nice to hear, I like the differences we all have :) 

As I said in my very first comment, I connect with strings best as its what I'm most familiar with so maybe it's just having less exposure to percussion instruments. 

Either way, cool discussion"
It's a big book and I'd say it was approx halfway. Lots of investment but it went from something dubious to something fantastic in an instant to me. The excessive worldbuilding pays off.
"Put it this way, I have about 15 or so games in my log and I cleared it for a second playthrough of this game."
Just watched the DB Cooper video. Awesome channel!!

"I fully intend to! Love that they come in 30 mL bottles - it makes such a difference, honestly."
Zebra is the best imo. It coexists with Cydia very well (jailbreak with unc0ver)
"This place is a bit pricey and it takes a bit for orders to arrive but their stuff is very cool:

WITH MY MIND ON MY MONEY
True. The problem with that particular issue was the need to remove the battery. The 500e platform requires the rear suspension to be removed to remove the battery. Bad design.
"Oh gosh... I love those candies that were in the orange and black wrappers! I think they were peanut butter chews right?

"Rotten Tomatoes is just a score aggregator, and their scoring system is a lot more flat than other weighted systems, like Metacritic.

The problem is that the Rotten/Fresh percentage is derived from a binary good/bad interpretation of a review. The reviews themselves aren't usually binary, but on 5-point or 10-point scales.

The result is middling reviews get normalized to either ""good"" or ""bad"", and the weight of a more nuanced opinion is lost in the wash of ""thing bad"" or ""thing good"".

They include the actual average rating normalized to a 10-point scale, but that's usually a smaller, less noticeable number."
"moose2, Brutalmoose’s side channel. I put his Nancy Drew and the Curse of Blackmoor Manor full play through video on when I want to veg. It’s 8-10 hours of chill. 
EDIT: OH MY GOD I just watched him stream today and he mentioned seeing this thread! How cool!!!"
"I live in the Bay and went to school in socal so I've been to a lot of different dropzones.  The best dz in the norcal are Skydance, Skydive California, and Skydive Bay Area (Byron).  Stick with those dzs and you'll have a great time!  Also, avoid hollister. 

For dz in socal, Skydive Santa Barbara and Taft are great.  Also, if you're willing to drive a bit away from LA, I would definitely recommend Perris and Elsinore."
They are the lava lamp of trees.
Came here to say the same. They did a great job with the tone of the show
"I see. Never in the past would I normally recommend the MacBook Air or Pro because they didn't provide much value in the past, but since they feature the new Apple M1 chip, they are definitely too good to ignore. Their build quality is solid, and what is especially nice about the MacBook Air is that it lacks a fan, so fan noise is not an issue. Also, their battery lives are incredible because of the Apple M1 chip (15 hours on the Air, 20 hours on the Pro).

If you want a Windows device, the ASUS Zenbook 13 with the i7-1165G7 is a great choice. The performance isn't anything crazy, but it has solid build quality and good battery life."
"As someone who has streamed for about 10 months with a c270, I would agree that it fits needs of a basic webcam. I did switch to a c920 though and will say it makes a HUGE difference. If you are just trying to figure out if you want to be a streamer, sure, the c270 is going to be fine. If you want to be on the same playing field as most other streamers though, you want a c920 or better. A good quality webcam, a good quality microphone, and a good overlay/alerts are all a standard of streaming these days and do not make you stand out. They are a minimum now unless you have something else that makes you really stand out."
What did you originally study? I'm just curious.
"As someone who has played orchestral percussion, it has its own set of challenges.  I think it’s easy to take snare and bass parts for granted, but there is a huge level of technique that will separate a professional from an amateur.  Timpani is an instrument that has its own set of challenges, between being tunable and requiring a different striking technique than other percussion instruments.  Then there’s mallets, which usually aren’t too involved in a lot of classical music, but there is a lot more that goes into it than notes and rhythms.  There is a lot of exacting work on technique done by percussionists.

I think concert percussion seem easy, and I myself have often taken it for granted, saying things like “it’s just concert music”.  However, like any instrument, there’s virtually a limitless skill cap, and there’s a lot of minute corrections and techniques that can be trained.  A classical percussionist is doing a lot more than playing rhythms at the correct volume.  They’re watching their stick heights, playing zones, choosing appropriate sticks/mallets, and a lot of other things that many people won’t notice.  Many, if not most, can play at accurate tempos from memory; for example, if you want me to play 112bpm, I can with no count, and it won’t be 111 or 113.  A classical percussionist is playing their pieces as perfectly as possible.  But that pretty much any professional orchestra musician though"

"Josh Keaton.... Oh cartoons don't count? Uhhh it has to be Tom hands down, he's endearing, he's funny, he has the quips down without being too much of a jerk, he makes Peter seem like a legitimately good person with rock solid morals where as the other two both occasionally had questionable morals, he plays the whole dealing with his Parker Luck really well without being a moopy idiot, he isn't meek but he isn't an asshole either. He truly feels like a kid."
"Yes, not just because of tooth decay, but because you are leaving rotting food in your mouth. I am bad about flossing every time I brush, but I feel gross if I wait more than 24 hours. Chances are on the occasion you do floss, the floss smells gross after using it, because you've left it long enough to fucking compost between your teeth. When you floss regularly, you don't have stinky rotting shit coming out when you do. You should floss at least as often as you wash your dishes. If you haven't removed the old rotting food from your teeth, why bother removing it from your plates and silverware?"
