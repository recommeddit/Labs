"The Staircase.  

A writer's wife dies under suspicious circumstances and he's tried for murder.  Absolutely amazing.  I watched it two years ago and I'm still wrestling with what unfolds in the documentary."
"Wow, guess we have the same taste in TV :D please lmk if any other shows come to mind that you like then! Could use some recs myself"
Hello. Can you update the list for UAE market.
"I've been in very similar situations at soccer games. Say ""Do not touch my dog"" and body block them or gently grab hold of and remove their hands if necessary. Just be pleasant but also absolutely firm."
Power music electric revival! Thanks for that. I haven't watched that video for at least 5 years. Feels like college.
"I really think Gilmore Girls is the perfect TV show. Drama length gives time to tell good stories, dialogue is ridiculously good, characters are all fleshed out really well, just enough drama to be interesting without getting awkward or angsty. I love this show. (for reference, other shows I've been watching lately include Archer, Sons of Anarchy, and Farscape)"
"Computer Science, Engineering, almost any STEM field..."

"I agree with you, but just to point out what OP said: 

>I don't like to use VIM or Notepad++ because they're ugly

He/she is looking for alternates to it"
"The Powerline III Flow is rated for 100W, but it's heavier, bulkier and more expensive than the Powerline III."
"But nothing about the question established that we were only talking about repertoire playable by a community orchestra. Putting a brass quintet together is a much more rewarding avenue for an amateur tuba player anyway. Repertoire with good tuba parts is all quite common for even decent youth orchestras and becomes increasingly common through conservatories and professional orchestras. I played Bruckner 7 and 8, 3 movements from Mahler 3, and Shostakovich 4 all before I left high school. And in a real orchestra they would never stick the tuba player on doubling a bass part, the tuba player just gets to leave whenever the orchestra is playing a piece without a tuba part. They still get to collect their salary even if for a week they only have to show up to rehearse some Berlioz overture and then go home while the orchestra does Mozart or Beethoven."

"Don't know, never had any problems with that. Even if hackers are building virussen for mac, it's much more interresting for them to build malware for phones these day's. Hope you're not on Android. Then you've A 99% chance there something on. It's just A matter of protecting yourself. Don't go to risky shady websites and use ad and tracker blockers. If that isn't enough, cut the cord and go offline. Only then you're safe. (But then they'll find it strange you're not connected and the man in black will track you down.)"

I use xournal ([http://xournal.sourceforge.net/](http://xournal.sourceforge.net/)).  You can set one of the pen buttons to activate the eraser while your holding it.  

There is xournal++ ([https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)) which might have the same features.

\*i originally had a problem with the intuos where half the tablet would be used and just weird screen behavior.  it took a long time to troubleshoot so i want to mention here in case anyone had the same problem and found their way here: the intuos can work with android phones and when plugged into a phone goes into 'android mode'.  when you plug an intuos into a computer using ubuntu, it might think it's a phone and go into android mode.  to switch out of android mode, hold the two outer buttons on the tablet until the indicator light on the tablet gets brighter (like 2 or 3 seconds)."
"Honestly, I'd love a plug-in hybrid F150 with like 20 miles of electric range (at zero load). The current 2.7EB engine combined with a 150hp/200lb-ft electric assist would be pretty much the ideal powertrain."

I met Clint Eastwood and his wife. Both of them were so genuinely nice.
"I have Girl Talk's ""All Day"" album on all of my run playlists.  Fantastic stuff."
Give the man some time to update the chart.  I'm sure he's getting all kinds of suggestions on stuff to add.
I definitely second this brand a lot. Chrome bags are amazing. Also I have had mine for almost 12 years now and still going strong.
