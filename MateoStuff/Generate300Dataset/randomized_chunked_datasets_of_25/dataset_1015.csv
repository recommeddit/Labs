30037,"Bluecoins (Premium)

PROS: Easy input (with various widgets), lots of reports that you can customize depending on what you want to see. Autosync/backup works perfectly (Premium only; I switched from free Money Manager because of this). Income/Expense reminders that can automatically input the amount (I use this for my salary and recurring expenses). No limits on the Accounts. Daily reminder actually works (Im looking at you again money manager)

CONS: Free ver doesn't have sync/backup via gdrive; only extract via excel/csv iirc. The widget, tho I can easily input expenses, I prefer notif bar quick menu/input.",best money managing app

This depends on the game. But if you're willing to sacrifice quality for refresh rate you can get 144hz out of a 1060

I can do a pretty much constant 120hz 1080p ultra on my 480 8gb card. I could go higher but I'd rather set a frame cap at 120hz and have a consistent frame rate over one that spikes and dips.",best desktop monitor

569,"I use the medium size for annotation and mark-up of pdfs. I also write notes with it. I tried the small at first and it is definitely not suitable for handwriting on such a large screen: you have to form tiny letters on the tablet that will be magnified hugely on the screen. Medium is the best bet but keep in mind that depending on your normal writing size, the medium may be too small for your screen. Make sure you can return the tablet for the large version if that is the case.",best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit

30129,"Yeah, it wasn’t an unusual war for the time, but it was controversial. Grant wrote in his memoir “For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.”",best Mexican war to study
