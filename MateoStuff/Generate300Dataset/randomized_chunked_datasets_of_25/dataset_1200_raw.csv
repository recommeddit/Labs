  I say that I'm not really a big fan of HR, but, yet, four out of my top 5 books are historicals. Go figure."

"It depends on what you're looking for. I think it's unfair to compare them to Bose. Especially their mouse lineup is very serviceable for both gaming and productivity. Plus, their customer service is exceptional in the states at least. I used to have a mouse from a very ""gamer"" brand, but after the shitty product support and customer service, it'll take a lot for me to consider anything not Logi for mice."
"Buy whatever you want

I'm just being facetious to get some laughs. :)"

"Was a server for Tom Cruise. Pretty cool dude, tbh. Was a bit out of touch, but that's to be expected. The funny part was he didn't know what he could order off of our menu, so he had to call his nutritionist to find out what to get. Ended up getting fried chicken"
"Since I live in Texas, the Mexican-American War is only touched up on during our unit on the Texas Revolution.

So much Spanish vocabulary assignments.

"New Orleans has a unique vibe that I haven't found anywhere else. Portland is quirky, very hipster. Chicago looks the most similar to New York but it's less diverse and the people are nicer, slower. Beautiful in the summer."

I hate that I love this so much
It's apparent that almost everyone misunderstood your poll. All discussion in this thread is based on European success and the voting seems to align with that for the most part as well.
I use the Dayquil/Nyquil pack. And if you can handle the flavor Theraflu is pretty good.
"Got them for running, ended up wearing them for all other occasions as well."
"Yeah, it's just like putting pepper on raw strawberries, that's really yummy too. Love the theme on the subreddit, btw!"
The fifth dentist is the one who didn't give in to bribery and is sticking to the real answer.
"Netflix: - The End of the F***king World (dark comedy, ‚Äúescaping from the cops‚Äù theme, short episodes, binge-worthy)
- House of Cards (U.S Version 2013-2018; great political thriller, focuses on corruption and has great narrative, created term ‚Äúbinge-watching‚Äù)
- The Spy (short-binge worthy drama that goes straight to the point)
- The Sinner (great psychological crime drama) 
- Sniffer (just try it out at first, crime)
- Jessica Jones (a detective, crime-related, great first season, not as comic book ish as you might think)
- Deathnote (anime ‚Äî simply incredible, questions morality, very good crime drama)

Amazon Prime: - Mr. Robot (currently on its final season, this show is just great ‚Äî many genres built into it but for good reason, underrated, a masterpiece imo)
- Beat (German show; focuses on a club murder and then leads into more, suspenseful, fun and interesting)"
