69228,best major to study in college,I graduated with a BA in History and a minor in Anthropology. I'm now starting nursing school because of how hard it is to find (and keep) a teaching job in my part of New York.
32922,best energy drink,"Old post but here 

Game fuel (mtn dew) 

• sounds retarded but it helped my awareness , I drank one all summer when playing in skirmishes etc. awareness and focus went up and that also makes accuracy go up if your focused and in the zone. 

Bang 

• 300mg of caffeine makes u go crazy so yeah , you’ll be cracked lmfao. 


G fuel 

• I’ve never really had g fuel like that but I’ve heard it works , I mean it’s meant for gaming. Game fuel would be your next bet since it’s easier to get.


Also drink water with it !!! Whatever drink u decided to take DRINK A BOTTLE OF WATER WITH IT. I promise u this helps a lot."
28300,best breakfast foods,"Some combination of eggs and siracha sauce. Eggs and rice, eggs and chicken, just eggs. Or some times a breakfast burrito w/ eggs, cheese, sausage . Though with the burrito I usually have a mexican hotsauce of some sort, name escapes me."

73423,best battery bank,Is it heavy?
51309,best iphone case,Their pop cases are intriguing.  I would get one if it didn't mean the loss of MagSafe.
23123,best celebrity,"I think he's the greatest, but my dad says he doesn't try, except during the playoffs."
3485,best college for research,"After scaling the rankings, I then resorted them. So, my theory of why GA Tech got to 41 is because when I re sorted, I didn't include LAC's.

Without LAC's on WSJ, GA Tech would be around 45-50. So, then this 41 average makes more sense."
35020,best NFL player,Maybe you should be an NFL kicker if it's such a breeze
53235,best usb c charging cable,"I can attest that UGREEN and CHOETECH are superior brands. These are Chinese brands. Not only for USB-C cables, but also for other items.
