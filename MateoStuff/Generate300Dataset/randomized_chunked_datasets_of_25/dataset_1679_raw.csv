"I met Tony Hawk at a local skate park. Just randomly he showed up. Of course people were freaking out, but he was such a laid back guy. Shook my hand and made small talk with me, a real nice guy.

A couple years ago, I ran into Skrillex in a public rest stop in Maine. He was doing a show later that night in the area, but for obvious reasons, I thought the restroom was a bad place to try to say hello. By the time I got outside, he was already on his tour bus. Iâ€™ll always regret that lol"
"I guess everyone has a different feedback using all of those networks. However, if I was you, I would give it a try. You have a great number of impressions per day, Locations are great (USA has a high eCPM average) and in the worst case, if you are not satisfied, just wait for 50$ threshold then get the cash and that's it."
How bout I do anywayyyyy
Barry Sanders. Damn shame he never reached his full potential.
"Beat me to *The Cell*.  Apart from the surreally-freaky nature of it, it's an awesome thriller."
Springtime in a Park is such a good one! Always makes me happy when I smell it
Off the Ranch is correct. All of Matt's channels are amazing.
"Best: Reese's, Snickers, Almond Joys, who am I kidding...all name brand chocolate is delicious.

Worst: When I was a kid I hated these [strawberry hard candies](http://cdn.nuts.com/images/auto/801x534/assets/a914dbc3f13e1f1c.jpg) and candy corn."
"I have a disability and am only capable of playing mobile for a while now.  This being more or less against my will, it makes me happy that there are people like you that actually choose to only play on mobile."

">You're blaming these issues on the glasses when it's really your lifestyle that can't handle them.

[Oh ho ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY1k1GcZRww) 

I'm not the person you replied to, but you're kinda right. At the same time, it's always nice to have a pair of sunglasses you're going to wear at a place where there's high risk of them breaking or something like that (ie, times when you anticipate being rowdy). I'm thinking of stuff like festivals, where you might need to block out the sun, be (potentially) intoxicated, or maybe just know the sun is going to come down before the event ends. Massive crowds = more chances of sunnies getting knocked off, stepped on, etc.

But yes - if you invest in a pair of nice sunglasses, you bet they're going to not break as easily as a cheap pair, and you'll be more mindful of where you keep them and who you allow to hold them. They'll also be more resistant to scratches, which is where I feel a lot of cheap sunglasses fail."
"Disagree -- I have a turtle. They get big, poop a lot, and need HUGE fish tanks, and don't particularly like being handled."
"No need to pit any disclaimers to Warren Ellis; in my opinion he's one of the finest current sci-fi authors.  I love most of his stuff, in particular *Transmetropolitan*, but I'm afraid he's overextending himself a little right now.  He's got three ongoing series: *Trees* and *Injection* are definitely science fiction, and both are excellent.  Most recently he rebooted *Wild C.A.Ts*, which is more of a superhero kind of sci-fi (the original and related titles, such as *Stormwatch* and *Authority* are still among my favorite superhero books), but I'm somewhat ambivalent about his latest effort.  I'm afraid that with so many projects at once he'll do another *Planetary* and essentially abandon the stories."
"Resolution isn't the problem.  The best camera I have is only 640x480, but it gets color, contrast, and brightness perfect so it is really nice.  It looks like a professional TV camera.  The highest resolution camera we have at work was $2k, and without really bright lights, the picture quality is just garbage."
"Woo, right on cue BP's success brings out people's insecurities."
"The pucca directors either refuse to work with Amir or have a fallout with him eventually due to his habit of hijacking all creative aspects of making a film. Case in point: Shankar - Refused to work. RGV - Fallout after Rangeela. Amol Gupte - hijacked TZP.  
  
 That leaves him with his pet directors, who he puts on the leash on the set: Raju Hirani and Vijay Kumar Acharya."
"you bought him for that price ALSO because he's english

even if he flop in italy there'll be a low table team wanting him back in PL"
"I am a lover of nice sunglasses.  I've had two pairs of Oakleys, two pairs of Ray-Bans, and one pair of Revo sunglasses over the years.

As far as shapes that will be fashionable for awhile, I think that you'll always be able to find people wearing aviators.  I have the [Ray-Ban Cockpit Aviators] (http://www.amazon.com/Ray-Ban-Cockpit-RB3362-003-32/dp/B001GNBK1S), and I love them.  I have a small-ish face, and the lenses are a little smaller than standard Ray-Ban aviators.  I bought them online after I tried on one of my friend's standard aviator sunglasses.  I knew that the standard ones weren't for me, so I figured I'd give the Cockpits a try.

I've read that people think that Ray-Bans are crappy for the price, but I've had two pairs of Ray-Bans, and I really like them both.  They've held up well over time, I like the styles, and they've protected my eyes from the sun.  Not really sure what people think makes them ""crappy.""  [Revo sunglasses] (http://www.revo.com/) are supposed to be good sunglasses, but a year after I bought mine I couldn't wear them anymore because the ear-pieces had stretched out a ton and I couldn't keep them on my face anymore.  One pair of my Ray-Bans is 10 years old now, and I still wear them.

As far as I can tell, the only place that you'll be able to get them ""on sale"" will probably be Amazon.  I was trying to get a good deal on my Cockpit sunglasses and ended up giving up and paying full price.  I wanted polarized lenses (they're so worth it), though, so that may have been why they never went on sale.

Edit - grammar"
"Do the zinc lozenges work?  And also, my 85 year old grandmother made me put Vicks on the bottom of my baby's feet and cover them with socks when she had pneumonia and was coughing every 10 seconds. I scoffed and did it to appease her but it worked.... What the heck is up with *that*?"
"Checked that out while at work earlier but only skimmed over it. Read over it more in depth now that I'm at home. 

Do you think Wordpress development and angular JS are worth it and/or potentially more marketable then just HTML + CSS + Javascript + MySQL?"
Honestly all bottled water tastes fine. Dasani and Nestle are bottled plastic resin and you won't change my mind.
Maaaaan it bummed me out when SMT became incompatible. What a good game that was to have on the phone.
"No particular order:

Steins;Gate

Baccano

Haruhi

Madoka

Death Note

Angel Beats

Those are what I'd consider the ""essentials"". For anime newbies, I'd suggest Death Note or Angel Beats first (both have made an anime 'hater' addicted). The other 4 are simply excellent series that I think pretty much anyone should watch."
