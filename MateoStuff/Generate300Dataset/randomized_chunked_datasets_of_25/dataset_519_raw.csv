Green one here too! It's yummy and fresh!
"Your comment broke me. It's going to be one of those phrases that randomly pops into my head and makes me look like an idiot laughing in public, I just know it."
"I don't think they should be - it's an HTTP request library, receiving a 400/500 error code still means that the HTTP request was completed (request was sent, response received) so I don't think that's exceptional behaviour."
"I originally bought those adidas supernovas (bright pink). Yea they sucked so I returned them, got the peg 37’s and lemme tell you these are the daily trainers you need."
"Japan needed more resources than simply oil. The home islands don't really have any substantial deposits of raw materials- if Japan were to stay a Great Power, she would have to obtain the resources of the surrounding area."
"Best advice I can give is find a job (or field) that you think you'll enjoy and excel at, then work backwards from there. Once you have an endpoint, think of the degree that will best get you there. 

The type of degree obviously matters but you also have to consider your interests. If you don't enjoy programming you probably won't be very successful with a computer science degree, or you'll end up hating your job which will make the marginal difference in salary not worth it."
"I'm seeing an almost uniform agreement that ""It doesn't matter"". So, I'll be getting that brand on my next shopping trip"

"1. Haram, been big on Armand hammer for 2 years and this was just perfect for me. I like the fat ray album same with Mach Hommy even though I never really got into them before. Tony Allen’s album too I like a lot. 

2. As a beat album moderators Midnight Madness, as one rap beat I will probably pick Tony Allen deer in headlights.

3. Jid. Anytime he features I feel he brings a show. Also I gotta say I like when the bruiser brigade feature on each other’s songs they are always my favorite just the way they mesh with each other. 

4. Billy woods all over Haram. If I were to pick on probably Robert Moses or scaffolds

5. Middle men on dope game stupid. I know there are probably better ones but it gets stuck in my head a lot. 

Gotta say most slept on album is probably the Tony Allen one for me. I never see any discussions about it but the drum beats are my favorite shit and he’s got good rappers with good songs all over it. 

Shouts out Genesis Owusu, and Sons of Kemet they get a lot of plays from me too"

"He was really chill, very laid back and nice. His family was really nice too. People came up asking for autographs and he just smiled and said sure. This one girl had him sign a book she had and he just laughed and signed it for her, he wasn't the author."
That's High Cost Low Quality.
What anti virus do you use? If you have a vpn does that stop intruders or make you more susceptible?
Brave. It doesn't need a long drawn out reason for why you should switch. Theres a reason they are adding 2m users a month.
Because no much room to fit a better camera in the top of the laptop screen.  It's physics

Good luck getting a decent job with a BS in the natural sciences.
Just ran out and checked cuz it's in the attached garage. Bought in 2000 brand new. Frigidaire brand. Love it and really helps our food bill.
