70075,best major to study in college,"The only issue is debt. I studied English, graduated with $0 in debt and $5000 in savings (my tuition was $120/year).

The only thing wrong with Liberal Arts is debt. If they can make college cheaper, we'd have a surge in the humanities again."

12713,best gifts for mom,"Time.   

I want us to sit around playing games (board games or video games- it doesn't matter which) and eat too much food and reminisce and laugh.  Laugh until our sides hurt.  I just want you to spend time with me.  Greatest gift ever.

But if you insist that I have something to unwrap then make me something.  I saved all your best artwork from grade school.  I keep my keys in that clay bowl you made and the small clay chicken that I thought was a dinosaur... well, I turned that one into a magnet for the fridge you know :)  I miss getting those things.   Make me another craft or ornament for the tree.  Draw me a picture that I can hang on the fridge or in my office or use as a bookmark even.  Make me a key ring so I'll think of you every time I reach for them.  I don't care if you're not super artistic.   I don't care if the item doesn't look like it belongs in fancy a catalog or an art gallery.

Don't bother spending money to buy me a key ring or an ornament- unless it's super special and has meaning - if it's linked to a a memory that's okay.   Because gift giving isn't about spending money.  It's about saying I remember you and I love you."

47582,best state to visit in the United States,"As someone who previously lived in NC - it's a great state.  Left for job reasons.  Love going back to visit - lots of cool hip cities like Durham and Asheville with cool local breweries, or more urban places like Raleigh and Charlotte, which are both bigger cities but very different from one another in their own right.  And of course, most of the NC coast is gorgeous...hmm, maybe I need to move back."
