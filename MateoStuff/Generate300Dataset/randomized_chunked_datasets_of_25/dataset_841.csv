The best editor is the one you'd like. Plain and simple"
34753,best NFL player,"I believe this conversation is basically Jerry Rice, Walter Payton, and now Tom Brady. Being a Bears homer, I’m goin’ Walter."
49517,best gaming monitor,"What is the difference between the monitor types that you listed? TN, VA, and IPS?"
47720,best state to visit in the United States,"For Rhode Island, I'd recommend visiting Narragansett and Jamestown. They have great beaches and other cool nature spots. And you gotta check out some of the seafood, maybe at Iggy's Chowderhouse or Legal Sea Foods."
66107,best college in california,"For what, a new /r/UCSF? Sure, but I don't actually go there and never have. I worked in a lab there for 2 summers, as did several of my friends. 'Course, if you just want someone to moderate spam I can do that, sure."
68929,best science fiction novel,"Not a bad list. I haven't read all of them, but the only one I might question is Burn-In, a very pedestrian thriller.

27461,best bollywood actor,"Watch parzania 

Although many here would not like it because of its controversial story line, Naseeruddin Shah was stellar with his performance and so was Sareeka.

I cannot recommend this movie enough."
46097,best trick or treating candy,"[DECOMPOSING PUMPKIN!](https://youtu.be/4qZA_WW6WKY)

THROW IT AT THAT PLUMP KID!

BECAUSE HIS MOM DID!

NOT GIVE US GOOD CANDY ON HALLOWEEN!"
59913,best perfume,I got Tokyo Milk's Light in my Birchbox this month and I'm loving it. Really considering buying the full size!
1622,best ice cream flavor,I've heard of cheese ones but I haven't found a recipe yet that doesn't have reviews that say it gets too many crystals or bad texture... I'd love to try a good one though.
12993,best gifts for mom,Do you have a link to the website? My mom's mom passed away a couple years ago and my mom would absolutely love having one as well.
57251,best water brand,"Ha, it's not because of health I say this, it's because coffee tastes better with those minerals."
59175,best perfume,I get a ton of compliments when I wear rose oil from this lovely little hole-in-the-wall shop.
35408,best alcoholic drink,"Mmmm whiskey would be good too. I’ve used brown sugar bourbon instead of everclear to make a richer, less college kid version. It’s just pricey. 

On the stove it doesn’t really matter, more than a couple cups as the sugar will saturate it. You’re really only giving the sugar something to dissolve in and since you’ll be adding back cider later, the amount isn’t crucial. I like to err on the less side as it’ll cool faster."
15783,best sunglasses for fashion,"Hold up a moment there, while TB's designs generally aren't the most appropriate clothing at all times, to call it ""crazy unwearable crap"" is just plain ignorant. He's one of the very few designers who pays extreme attention to details and production of his clothing. And also one of the very few who can claim the exorbiant prices he demands is somewhat acceptable without taking into account his worth as a designer. I highly suggest you go check on some of his clothing if you ever get the chance."
10349,best suitcase lock,"Like a guy in a $5,000 suit cares what the guy in a $3,000 suit thinks. Come on."
657,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"Till now I have used lots of VPNs like CyberGhost, TunnelBear, etc. but none of them was able to provide satisfactory results while doing torrenting. But recently I switched to ExpressVPN and the results were really satisfactory. It helped me to share file torrent with other with the maximum protection and fast speed. For torrents, I would strongly suggest all of you go with ExpressVPN."
