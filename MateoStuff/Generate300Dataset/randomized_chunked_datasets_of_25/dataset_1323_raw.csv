I use visual studio at work and vim at home. I don't think there's a reason to use an IDE for C if you don't work on a bigger project with more than one developer.
"Yeah with that dpi you'd spin around 5 times for moving half an inch lol. Makes sense you didn't notice based on your games and that you use a controller. Also makes sense why you only need medium, so that's a plus!

Yeah I prefer soft, but I also like xsoft. Mid is my least favorite except for Raiden and shidenkai."
Are you saying that Gene Upshaw and Eugene Upshaw are different people?

"I have this and it's great. The only downside is that, because of the type of display it is(I don't know why this is so i'll sound like an idiot), when you're playing a dark game and there's even a slight bit of light in your room, the screen is very reflective. For example, playing rust and it turns to night time, i Can't see anything unless it's dark outside IRL. So turning up gamma is a must for dark games, but an awesome monitor nonetheless."
Yeah! When I saw the Die Hard one I was like: “Frank Sinatra was gonna be John McClane?! WTF?!?!?!”
"I loved moose tracks ice cream so much when I was a kid. Haven't seen it in the longest time, though. :("
Jesus Christ the answers here. Notepad++ really? Go the Idea Intellij route and never look back!
"Kakoune.

Vim-like, just with a more usable design philosophy, better discoverability and interactivity."
">A lot of talk about Mullvad. Where would you recommended getting started with it? (aside from downloading it obviously.)

Proper, unlimited and full port forwarding."
"In my experience getting a good sound on a drumkit usually takes way longer than on guitar,bass or piano for beginners. Most people just hit the drums and it doesn't sound tight or musical at all. For most drummers it takes a couple of years before you could actually play a song without sounding like a complete beginner."
"Is the expectation that we hold our phones to use them and set them down on their faces rather than their backs?

ETA: iPhone 13 pro with clear mag safe case doesn’t work on my car’s wi charger because it won’t sit flat. Arg."
"Imo for the best game it’s a tie between HGSS for the exploration and B2W2 for, well, the game per se (with USUM just a step behind). For the worst I have to say XY, cause it feels... bland. Like, it doesn’t stick out for any reason to me, tho it’s still a good game"
Trial By Media
"The font one is cool, never heard of something like that before."
They're also the freshest!
This is beyond revolting. Congratulations.
"The one month I used them, I had a Pixel 1 at the time. My wife had an iPhone 6S+, so we got the sim for her phone but I popped it into my phone immediately and it worked fine. I might have had to modify the APN, but I don’t recall. If you know anyone with an iPhone, see if they’ll go with you to sign up for service."
Seconded... very good
you gotta try black raspberry chip from Graeter's
Icelandic glacial water
"That reminds me of the ""cloud to butt"" extension lol

Edit: I love these stories everyone!"
"I would love to go to culinary school, but with the way things are currently, it would be cheaper to go through with college. At least for the first two years, as the state pays for tuition."
Camped there several times when I was younger. Mount marcy!  Highest point in NY. I remember that last like half mile is literally uphill gaining 1k in elevation. It was raining so the rocks were slippery as was trees/grass. Made it up tho! Was just looking at those photos the other day.Beautiful scenery. Wildlife is awesome too!
