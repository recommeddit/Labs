24237,best anime,"Thanks for the link.

I knew about that list, but chose not to use it (because it's shounen heavy, like you say).  And one of my goals was to have an alternative to the shounen heavy lists."
64776,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"I like Mesa Verde for creative, delicious vegetarian food."
38131,best Marvel movie,"As a big Marvel fan, I think all of them are worth watching except Incredible Hulk. Beyond that it comes down to preference. A lot of people don’t like the first two Thor movies, I don’t like the Ant-man movies much, but pretty much all of them have good qualities and contribute something important to the overall narrative arc."

47995,best color to paint with,"Why is this a huge mistake? I painted the east-west walls red, and the north-south walls orange... I'm also completely colourblind."
15899,best sunglasses for fashion,"Eh, I'm not sure that's entirely true. I've had both Ray-Bans and Oliver Peoples (currently only have the former), and I still found the Oliver Peoples to be of a higher quality. The primary difference I noticed was that the hinge on the Oliver Peoples was much more substantial and protective of the glasses' shape. Then of course there was the fact that from a design perspective, I think Oliver Peoples blows Ray-Bans out of the water. 

However, to the question, I'm still not sure those differences are worth the price jump, but I understand people who would rather have the Oliver Peoples (myself included) for the quality bump and the (in my opinion) better design."

38126,best Marvel movie,"Thanks! Yeah, there seems to be a lot of people in this thread that enjoy Ultron. I can't say I'm one of them haha. To me, Ultron was always the worst Avengers movie and I don't feel there's anything you're missing storywise without it except for maybe the introduction of some new characters which are easily explained during the exposition in Civil War."

15217,best tree for the garden,"Hardiness zone 4 is good for most magnolias. I don't recommend it since it flowers early then doesn't look great in front of everything else after, but the climate is rarely an issue."

They're still on Amazon. All they did is rename themselves to iSmart, remove all mentions of RavPower from their product nomenclature.
