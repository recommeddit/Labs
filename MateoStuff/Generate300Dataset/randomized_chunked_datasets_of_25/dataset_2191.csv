13127,best gifts for mom,"Your time and friendship. The second best gift? A gift certificate to a professional photography studio. Yeah, we live in the digital age of cellphones and all that, but those hard copies you can hang on a wall have real value."
21479,best workout music,[gets the muscles all hard and sweaty like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3okb3kuts)
22961,best celebrity,"This is, **literally**, the most uplifting news in the history of mankind"
14033,best place to get free books,Really? My local library doesn’t do that. I would also want to know are all books in eBook format or just select ones?
34253,best NFL player,"Lol had this argument in our vikings sub, theres people that think this dude is borderline top 10 when hes is top 5 if not that top 8 i guess cause he plays for the cowboys"
52003,best iphone case,How about a wallet case like [this?](https://www.mujjo.com/full-leather-wallet-case-for-iphone-13-pro-tan/) I just ordered one.
69730,best major to study in college,"Agreed. College is the epitome of YMMV. An in-demand major helps, but doesn't mean jack if you don't put in the work to network and intern. A shitty degree held by someone who did internships for at least the latter half of their education will be looked at better than a ""good"" degree holder with no experience. 

So, incoming college goers: INTERN. NETWORK. SCHMOOZE."
22615,best celebrity,This is because she came out against the film after they did it.
40509,best midrange GPU,"With the current shortage i'd say gtx730 or maybe a 1050ti, nah just kidding maybe a 1660 super or an 2060"

55737,best action and adventure novel series,"This series is great up until the 5th(?, i think its the 5th). Then it falls off a cliff."
7452,best laptop for general use,"hey just came across your series. Super helpful. I recently took a travel job and want to buy a laptop so I have something to do in the hotel rooms when i’m done work. Weight and battery life don’t matter for me at all. The longest flight i would need to go on would be ~6 hours so i would need about 6-8 hours of battery life which i assume is pretty standard. I play mostly single player rpg games. Only shooter online game i play is destiny 2. 

Any suggestions? I’d like to keep it around 2k maybe 2500 max if it’s a big difference. Graphics and screen size are probably the most important to me as i’m used to gaming on an 85” 4k oled tv. 

Thank you in advance if your respond!"

31570,best hotel to live in,Look at the new Sarika tents. I think people like to say it’s overrated because the original rooms are small for the price. But you’re really paying for having luxury in the middle of nowhere.
56405,best desktop monitor,"For gaming purposes, I'm waiting for the Viewsonic Xg2431 with the Blurbuster 2.0 certification. Good size to res ratio, IPS, and the top level motion blur reduction is something I'm looking forward to experiencing for myself."
