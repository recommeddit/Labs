3335,best webcamera,"Im using my ipad as a camera for my stream—surprisingly looks ok besides the face tracking. I figure I’ll get a real camera down the road if I feel comfortable enough with it.

Edit: I should probably add that I didn’t get the iPad specifically to use as a camera, i used it for art/digital media things and thought it a clever idea to use it as a streaming camera when I have nothing else. Please don’t go and buy an iPad for this purpose."
16834,best pet for toddlers,"Could you look into letting her volunteer at sn animal charity? I do not know if there is an age limit,but it might take the edge off her desire if she can spend time with some animals."
73458,best battery bank,"I use an Anker Powercore Slim usb-c PD. 10,000. They have one now that also has a stand on it which is nice. Fits nicely in all my tech pouches or slots in backpacks. 20,000 are heavy (I have one of those too for trips where I could be away from an outlet a while).

They also have a 20000 that has wireless charging, PD, and a stand for your phone. Pretty cool. 

10k is my sweet spot and good for most people I think."
18753,best YouTube video,"[This video always gets me. Stay with it, it gets great.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkXy12xVnRs)"
73437,best battery bank,"Using the Zendure 10,000 mAh. Love how small it is, and has usb-c."
52205,best hiphop album,I know but that's what Iove about hip hop it is so vast  and it has so much depth it's incredible
9047,best toothpaste,"Also, if you don't floss, all the gum disease will destroy your gums and leave gaping holes in between your teeth. The tissue will never grow back."
13438,best spreadsheet editor,"There are a limited number of queries that you can make per day, but yes.  It is essentially acting like a database."
47903,best color to paint with,Christina and Tarek were famous for this on literally all their renos.
51598,best iphone case,"[Here’s mine](https://imgur.com/a/qmK29B0) TOZO thin case, pitaka mag case and Apple leather case"
978,best ice cream flavor,"Wait a minute, there’s a fucking extreme version?! You just helped me discover my new goal in life."
50558,best rap album,"I'm surprised no one has said RAP Music by Killer Mike or Cancer 4 Cure by El-P. those are some of El's most polished works.

The thing I love about El-P is that he can change his production to match the style that he goes for. RAP Music was crazy and vibrant and southern. Cancer 4 Cure is more industrial and darker. Both amazing El-Producto works.

And now I see that u/kingmusa has posted both RM and C4C. My opinions still stand."
18795,best YouTube video,"Damn I thought he was American, I gotta improve my skills to pick up accents"
14917,best romantic novel,What does the open door/closed door thing stand for?
72453,best keyboard switches,Gat Yellows
65179,best phone service company,"I will say this:

As far as it goes, only a few years back T-Mobile sites in our market were just thrown together. They'd give us a couple days, keep as much of it on air as we could, and fuckin get er done.

Verizon and ATnT have high standards, but att is super anal about small details, and run more than they need; a lot of their stuff is still running coax which is a lot slower and more unreliable than fiber optic.

Verizon is nice to build because they give us the materials for it, we tailor build to site design. It always looks real clean to get on a new site.

Now Verizon and Tmo are trying for the same sleek designs as well as running full fiber optic whereas I still see att running a lot of coax.

It's still a pain in the ass to build these sites, but they seem put together a good bit more competent than before.

Can't speak for service. I use Verizon. They cover everywhere I need them too and I have wifi for where they don't. I think tmo might be worth it, but I'd sacrifice hours of coverage at a time when I build their sites."
23831,best car racing video game,"If you are up for some simulation, I recommend you Dirt Rally and even better, Live for Speed. They are easily the games with most realist physics I ever played and they both run really well on various hardware. ;)"
16743,best pet for toddlers,Of course! I phrased the question wrong. I know the deal with kids and pets
31945,best hotel to live in,"You might be right, I do not know a lot about hotel programs. I think that Ritz gold status is good enough for me though. Gold status gets you free breakfast or club lounge access at Marriott. Most of the Marriotts seem to have the lounges. If you bill everything to your room it is not too hard to spend on the Ritz card at the 5x bonus rate. Spending 10k a year on the Ritz card to keep gold status does not seem that hard. You also get free internet at Marriott. You also get free room upgrades where available"
5051,best home improvement store,"I have bought my dog a few times to HD, mostly when she was younger in order to socialize her, and for this reason always find some grass outside for her before we go in."
55707,best action and adventure novel series,Besides Alan Dean Foster's novelization of *Star Trek 2009*? Maybe *Infected* by Scott Sigler. It's an alien invasion thriller with body horror.
26477,best politician,"People skills, no skeletons in your closet (or if there that won't be found), joining the right political party in the right area. A political belief would be good too, but know many politicians that have no plans/ideas"
