37763,best Marvel movie,"I'd say Doctor Strange and Ant man and the wasp were both better than BP, but I do agree that Killmonger was arguable one of the best villains and more could have been done with that character."

37470,best amusement park,"I was thinking DCA it went from tacky to good with the front entrance, paradise pier, and cars land remodel. But then it went from good to tacky again with Pixar pier and guardians of the Galaxy. We'll see how the avengers campus goes but I'm tired of the themed IP lands. DCA is loosing it's identy and becoming a conglomeration of random lands based on random intellectual properties with no overarching theme at all."

64987,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Ahi IMO is second best to Sakana as sushi goes and it is more reasonably priced. Also you're SOL with asian food in SB. You gotta take the 1:30 min drive to LA for that.
