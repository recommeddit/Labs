39265,"While I use Firefox as my daily driver and whole heartedly endorse it, I wouldn't quite say it works everywhere. 

Every once in a while I find a site that is still very clearly chromium optimized, and I'll need to switch back over. Also, Firefox does not support Progressive Web Apps nearly as well as Chromium. So I'd still recommend using Firefox as your main browser, but when you do need a Chromium backup I'd recommend Brave. It's a privacy focused Chromium skin.",best web browser

67666,"It's more complicated than that. To get the convenience of Axios, you have to understand how `fetch` works and then deal yourself with the parsing and the promise handling around it.


    // If the response is empty, response.json() will throw, so first make sure
    // it's not empty by parsing the text.
    const parseJsonResponse = response => response.text()
      .then(text => (text ? JSON.parse(text) : {}));

    // Fetch like jQuery ajax, Axios or other requests libs.
    fetch(/* */)
      .then(
        rawResponse => parseJsonResponse(rawResponse)
          // Any HTTP status gets resolved.
          .then(response => response.ok
            ? response
            // So we manually reject status that are not ""ok"" (usually outside 200-299)
            : Promise.reject(response)
          ),
        // Network error, etc.
        rawError => parseJsonResponse(rawError)
          .then(Promise.reject)
      );


This doesn't look trivial to me, and is the simplest snippet to get a similar behaviour that we're used to with Axios and jQuery's `ajax` for example.

Some Stack Overflow questions that prove it's not trivial:

- [Fetch: reject promise and catch the error if status is not OK?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/38235715/1218980)
- [Fetch API error handling](https://stackoverflow.com/q/50330795/1218980)

Living in Boise, where truly the most people live, it's hard to say which of the two is more popular. Based on my limited interactions it seems to be Lagoon here as well, but they're both far enough away to be out of most peoples' radars.

I often joked that I moved to Australia to find him and then one day, all of the sudden, heâ€™s in my restaurant walking up to the host stand. I was so horrified by my own normalcy that I could barely look up at him (heâ€™s so tall). I tried to seat him and his wife at a table in my section but he politely asked to be moved to a quieter area. While I was slightly disappointed that he wouldnâ€™t be sitting in my section, I awkwardly smiled on and directed them to a more secluded section. He and his wife couldnâ€™t decide which table so I made some lame joke about sitting at two separate tables and throwing the food at each other (this was a 6 star resort restaurant, boss did not like hearing that comment).
They sat, I put a napkin on his lap, almost shit myself, and their dinner went smoothly. The end.",best celebrity
56603,"For those of you with multiple monitors with different resolutions, there is a program that fixes the mismatch of the mouse position between the monitors, called LittleBigMouse. It's an open source project on github and It's especially useful in 1080p/4k setups to be able to more easily move the mouse between monitors without confusion. I use it with a 1440p/1080p setup and the mouse cursor lines up on both monitors smoothly and seamlessly.

The one recommendation I have is make sure to disable it any time you plan to change monitor resolution or position in the Windows settings and the re-enable it after because it can get a little screwy and lock your mouse cursor in a smaller area than it's supposed to if you're not careful.",best desktop monitor
