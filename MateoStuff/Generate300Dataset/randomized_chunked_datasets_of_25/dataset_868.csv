44459,best items under $100,"Ugh. I got so irritated last weekend. Went for a hike just before dusk and gave myself plenty of time. I was ten mins from the car park and passed three sets of hikers going the other direction. The one solo hiker had a light with her, but the two families didn’t.

 I stopped to talk to them both. The first family had four adults and three kids under the age of 10. I warned them that it was close to sunset and the path is hard to find in the dark—especially this time of year with all the leaves down and not enough traffic to clear them. They were intent on reaching the tower to watch sun sent. I told them they had ten mins to make a solid twenty min hike. They ignored me and kept going. No lights, but insisted they would be fine with their phones. 

Second family they didn’t know the park well and agreed that turning around at the boardwalk (about five mins farther and before any climbing) would be better. I am confident they listened. 

I gave the ranger line a call to say I was concerned about the family (also mentioned the solo hiker). I did SAR for years and still have friends involved. Sure enough they had to go up an hour after dark because the family got lost and turned around."

First of all, fragrance is something subjective and there's no guide on which fragrances are right and wrong. Asking which fragrances are ""the best"" is like asking which food is the best. Different people like different things. But, like with food, there are certain fragrances that are universally loved. Like how pretty much everyone loves pizza or ice cream.

So, what I would recommend:

**The all-rounder**  
Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme - If you just want 1 fragrance, this is the one I'd recommend. Works everywhere. Class? Yes. Clubs? Yes. Warm or cold temperature? Doesn't matter.

**The sexy fragrance**  
YSL La Nuit De L'Homme - When it comes to scent solely, this one probably garners the best female reactions. Smells seductive, sensual and masculine.

**The ""night out"" fragrance**  
Jean-Paul Gaultier Ultra Male (or: Versace Eros) - For clubbing you want something sweet and sexy, but a bit louder.

I think those 3 fragrance types make a great foundation: one ""day-to-day"" fragrance, one ""date"" fragrance and one ""night out"" fragrance.

If you however want to go even beyond 3, there are plenty of other fragrances that I can recommend for different situations.

For example:

**The upscale fragrance**  
Prada L'Homme (or: YSL L'Homme) - Whenever you're in a formal or business situation and want to smell nice, but don't want to risk coming of as inappropriate.

**The ""hot weather"" fragrance**  
Dior Sauvage - Nice, fresh smell which can pretty much be worn to any occasion, as long as it's quite warm.

**The ""cold weather"" fragrance**  
Viktor&Rolf Spicebomb Extreme - Nice, sweet and spicy smell which can pretty much be worn to any occasion, as long as it's quite cold.

Once you have those 6 categories filled in, you should be knowledgable enough to make your own decisions when it comes to fragrances, because you've pretty much had a taste of everything on the fragrance spectrum.

Also, I'm 20 so you don't have to worry about me recommending any ""old man"" scents. And I hang out at r/fragrance quite often."
65709,best college in california,"San Jose State has got the biggest course catalog in the system.  It's a very large and diverse school, and the engineering and CS departments are fairly well in synch with Silicon Valley.

UCSC is considered junior league compared to some of the bigger campus; and in many ways it is: quirky, underfunded, administratively shakey, no big professional schools, doesn't get the huge grants.  Doesn't even have a full engineering school (if you wanted to do mechanical engineering, you'd have to finish at Berkeley).  It's been mainly a liberal arts university up till 20 years ago, but is trying to move in other directions.

That said, it's got its hot spots and people tell me that econ is one of them.  (I live in Santa Cruz.) They made a breakthrough a couple of years back in getting some interns placed on Wall Street, and they got offers.  Not to say that that'd happen to you, just that the program is good.

The new-ish game design major (now called computational media) is really successful, and the department is well hooked in with the industry.  New robotics major, too.  And genomics is taking off, but that's not your field of interest.

Physically, the campus is amazing.  Few others like it.  Good in some ways -- really beautiful, deer in the roads -- not so good in others as it's very decentralized and there's no real center _and_ it's on the edge of town without a student neighborhood."
