Hey those were going to be my answers!
"I think Kong Kong definitely features in there. There is quite a lot of adventure in it. I consider Jacksons King Kong the best one, and it is full of adventure"
"I work as a consultant, business system analyst, took the cisa course but didn't take the exam. I'm in Quebec, Canada, what are the standart billing rates for a Cisa in the US ? Do you have any idea about Canada ? Thanks"

That's the thing about finding the perfect gift: you can never top it! But that sounds like it was a real winner.
"*The Legacy of Heorot* by Niven and Pournelle starts a little slow, but ends all action.  

*Snowcrash* is all crazy action.  

*Jurassic Park* is great, the action is without peer.  

OH my oh my, *Kiln People* by Brin has incredible action, and is fucking hilarious to boot."

"Jerry Rice. He is the only unanimous best player at his position. His stats are unbreakable, his longevity, and arguably his prime was the best the NFL has ever seen among the WR position. 

But if there was an all-time NFL draft and I had #1 overall pick I'd take Peyton Manning since I think you'd be foolish not to take a QB  in that situation and he would be the sure fire dominant player regardless of whatever team he would be stuck with."
"Honey Badger don't care, doesn't give a shit"
Check out Crying Suns. Very similar but with fleets instead of just crew management. You won’t be disappointed.  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crying-suns/id1511788295
"Apart from all the external factors, some people are just more likely to get cavities than others, just like some are more prone to cancer. That doesn't make you clinical study case or superhuman. So, congratulations on not getting cavities and not dying of leukemia when you were 10.

If it makes you feel better, it's possible you'll go bald before 40."
"oh i see, i'm in the very first hours of the course and i found it kind of ""meh"", i mean not bad and not so good either but yeah still hard to follow compared with other instructors such as colt steele or angela. I'll give a try with stephen tho."
DVC now is at r/DVC!!    Yeah.
"Best Orleans is legitimately unlike any city I've ever been to. 

It's simultaneously [the most hostile and least hostile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R34UjzJvJeQ) place in the world."
Agreed. Axios has nice defaults as well.
"Atomic Habits, Deep Work, and Getting Things Done are three of the top ones that come to mind. You can also check out my own [Stop Wasting Time book](https://amzn.to/2WXd63X) on Amazon and my [Time Tips YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/c/garlandcoulson)"
"As far as ive read online, M1 is pretty good but everyone in the same professions advices to get into those rtx graphic cards.

Thanks for the input on gaming laptops, it is helpful info, i also will use it in the future for multiple video outputs and it looks like gaming laptops do a good job on it, however I will take your advice. Will need a good tool to work and not slack off"
Koss porta pro ---- 30$ and sounds better than most 150$ headphones. Those who really know headphones will have a set of these.

I have 15 tabs open on edge and it lags like crazy when i try to open another one... That didn't happen even on normal Chrome.
There is a private tracker where you can get far more ebooks and audiobooks than what.cd ever had. I would be killed if I mentioned the name.
"This is Virginia, for anyone trying to ctrl+f. 

Speaking of historical sites, I'd also recommend Monticello in Charlottesville (then go hit up the outdoor mall, which, as a VT alum, it pains me to admit is actually quite lovely), Montpelier (really beautiful drive to get there especially), and especially Mount Vernon, which underwent some real improvements in the past 5-10 years and blew my mind when I went back. 

If you go to Mount Vernon, I'd also recommend spending some time in Old Town Alexandria - it's a really cool old section of the city with great restaurants, shopping, and is easy to walk around. Arlington National Cemetery is very close by too, between a 20min and 5hr drive depending on traffic and time of day.

Southwest VA has some really beautiful scenery, but not a lot of things in particular I can think of other than the Natural Bridge and good hiking. If you're driving south to North Carolina, I'd also recommend you take 81-77 rather than hugging the coast, because the views from the mountains around the state border are breathtaking, especially in the morning when it's still foggy in the valleys."
"Brad Hodge would not even feature in my top five barmen who couldn't really crack the Australian team in that period. 

The Australia second XI was probably the second best team in the world for a period there. It was nuts, and you feel for guys like Stuart Law, Matthew Elliott, Michael Di Venuto, Jimmy Maher, Jamie Cox, Jamie Siddons, Darren Lehmann, David Hussey..."
