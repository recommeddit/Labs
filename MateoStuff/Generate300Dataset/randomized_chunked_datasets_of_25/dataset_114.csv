59517,best perfume,"Love these! You have great taste and tend to gravitate toward bold classical scents. Most men would be scared to wear such striking, traditionally feminine perfumes, so I’m guessing you’re a woman, probably past your twenties. You’re confident and put-together,  sharp as a tack, occasionally intimidating, but also somebody that people trust. You love going out on the town, but only to grand events and sophisticated venues. You don’t take shit from anyone. :)"

The company also understands that they can't keep me in any place permanently without me disagreeing to it. I can opt to go back to Texas if I want, but I lose my reimbursement."
