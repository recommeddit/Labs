43849,best items under $100,"More or less. A couple are actually derivatives of the Pi, but with different IO stuffs and a different SoC. 

I mean, at the end of the day, they are all.  They have a CPU, storage, and memory got memory. You put an OS on it and run software on it. Not all that much different than the desktop box I'm typing this message on."

3860,best online college,"Nah, people get work experience or actually just self-study if they want to learn. The reason they pay ass-tons of money is because they need certified learning.


You wouldn't go to a doctor who didn't have a medical degree but was capable of performing heart surgery."

61146,Best comedy show on Netflix,"I'm shocked not to see ""Coupling"" mentioned.  My favorite sitcom of all time."
60815,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Ali Wong. 

I’m not American so the stand up specials from America tend to be underwhelming (cultural differences I guess) even if they’re from people whose other work I enjoy (looking at you, Donald Glover). 

I deadass couldn’t stop laughing at Ali Wong’s specials! I hope she makes another one, and hopefully gets her own show soon."

53513,best medicine for a cold,"Unfortunately my husband has a pretty bad autoimmune disorder so we see doctors and spend more time in hospitals than most people so its probably a law of averages thing that eventually we get stuck with the one that won't listen or thinks because they've never heard of it, it must not be real. I did file a complaint and send pictures of the vomit all over my car. If its listed as an allergy in the chart why would they decide to ignore that because they dont think it's real? Arrogance or stupidity is all I can think of."

942,best desk lamp,"Here's the other 2 I could find. Much cleaner. It's a simple wall shelf, black, Lack I think it was. And the legs I forget the name, but they make rectangular ones, I opted for the cylindrical ones with padded feet, the second (middle) length. I think they were 4-5"". Enough room to fit a laptop or docking station underneath plus whatever else I needed. 

They were so cheap to make I made one for the other side of the room for my direct report as well when I had him. Love those shelves, can't wait to move and be able to use them again.
