Pay for the autograph?
I've never seen one but I know some women like when you play the clitoris.

The one player I can't fit anywhere is Martin Crowe. Anyway. This is how I'd rank them."
I've never had a toothbrush fray severely. I've seen some people's brushes that were frayed to shit. How do they even do that? Wtf?
"True, that was spectacular."
"It's become pretty much cliche at this point to hate on these sort of lists whenever they come out. People will inevitably make comments like-

""X album should have been higher! This list is bullshit!""

Or-

""X album should have been lower! This list is bullshit!""

Or- 

""Where the hell is X? This list is bullshit!""

But generally speaking, I like the list. It has a good mix of genres, a lot of albums that I have never even heard of before, and a good mix of ""classics"" and newer releases. Sure, we can nitpick over it for weeks to come, but in the end it's just a list. If you don't like it, don't act like it's the end of the world.

Just look at NME's description of their list-

""The final, definitive, definitely last of its kind, never to be repeated, comprehensive and absolutely accurate word on the best records ever.""

They're actually making fun of anyone who claims ranking albums is a matter of fact and not opinion."
I just wish you could move faster than a slug in this game.
$150 as a starter?
RTJ 3 specifically is my top fitness album.
"Believe it or not, Home Depot actually had the cheapest blinds when I bought them in July during a 30% off sale."
Brave. Try it. It'll change your life.
Just not cited here.
Don’t get that. It’s cheap af for a reason.
"This is just so cool :')

hi everyone, I made that channel. AMA"
"You can get a decent tent and other basic camping supplies for under $100, and camping makes life awesome."
"A cup of chicken soup, a cup of orange juice, a cup of hot tea with lemon and honey, and a cup of peppermint tea. All washed down by water. Take an antihistamine, and a couple ibuprofen. Sleep as much as possible and eat something light. Wrap up warm. All good!"
"*Gulliver's Travels* by Jonathan Swift.  

As a kid, I had read an abridged and illustrated version of the popular Lilliput episode and liked it well enough. But it was only later when I read the book in its original unabridged form that I grew to appreciate Swift's vibrant imagination and ingenuity. The world-building really impressed me, and the curiosity to know what sort of people/creatures the titular character would encounter and what their interactions would bring kept me turning the pages. I also found it really neat how Swift managed to weave social commentary and satire into what seems like a simple adventure story on the surface."
"A large majority of nurses will retire in the next 5-15 years.  Also it depends on your area.  New York, California, and Florida are a little rough right now for nurses, especially new grads.  I live in Virginia and we are hiring nurses all the time.  The new grads that pass their NCLEX the first try after graduation find work within 3 months of graduation."
but its still cld when i wanna go out
The Spanish Prisoner. Didn't see that coming.
"Ready Player One, Neuromancer, Ender's Game."
How do you do laundry?
"Of course, if the concern is that TSA is stealing from luggage, you've just made it easier for the agent to get into the bag without you knowing. That's a TSA approved lock which they have keys into."
"That's not true at all. The first plot twist was in 1903, in The Great Train Robbery. 1920(?) The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, and last but not least, Citizen Kane. Such a masterclass movie and a classic. Well, these are 'different' twists than twists these day but they are all considered as twists. :) And The sting got 3 votes in the comments, Im sure I will watch it next week! :D"
