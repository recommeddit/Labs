If you’re a student you can try YNAB free for a year.
"Nutella, and you put some Nutella in the ice cream so it hardens to the consistency of fudge"

"Late 20s to early 30s. Confident, but reserved. Not afraid to cut loose when around the right people."
Are you from 1899?
Nice.
Cyber truck will range from 70k to eventually 40k Sans full self driving.  That’s the one I’m keeping an eye on.
"Riu Moon Palace in Cancun was very similar. My only beef with these big mega resorts is that they are very insulated from the area they are in. This could be exactly what you're looking for, but if you want to get the local flavor you need to make an effort to get off property."
"I second Witcher if you haven't played it. For what it's worth I certainly had fun with Odyssey but I think I like Origins more, Egypt is an awesome setting for a game. If you're looking for more of a hardcore RPG, Divinity: Original I and II are fantastic games with great stories, just do some research and make sure it's the kind of game you'd enjoy. Dragon Age: Inquisition is pretty good and seems up your alley."

I think it's basically a choice between HDR or gsync.
My beta lasted 3 years in a regular plastic tank
"You should check out The Finder its a really good show, unfortunately theres only one season"
"I've read the initial trilogy, Riyria Revelations and yes, it's very adventurey. The first two books are basically 4 individual little adventures of about 300 pages each and the final book is one big finale. 

It just follows these two friends, a notorious thieves guild, as they get swept up in more and more important events that require their skills or obligations."
Thanks! Going to check this one out! Seems great.
"MPC-HC is lightweight and performs well. But if PotPlayer performs well-enough for you, then why even consider switching? Besides, performance is really dependent upon the renderer you use, and both PotPlayer and MPC-HC can use just about any. (The best current renderer is, arguably, madVR.)"
Anything but Acqua Di Gio from Armani. You're supposed to wear cologne to stand out but wearing this makes you smell exactly the same as the ten other guys in the room.
"If I were a parent, I don't think I'd make that choice unless the kid had health problems that made sugar a bad idea. People are going to crave sweets, so why not let the kid have it in an environment where you can control the intake, rather than make them go to great lengths to sneakily get sugar?"
"Wow, I'm surprised that BGT is more popular than SWO"
"Well for less than $100 you can get a gym membership, then all you need to do is use your self discipli- oh wait."
"The best site to find working full apps for mac is: [nmac.to](https://nmac.to) . Disclaimer: I am not related to the site, just a suggestion."

"Oh, you sweet summer child..."
Illmatic.
"With how technology is always advancing, there isn't really any rule (that I know of) for this type of thing.  


A product suggestion though, I purchased a belkin 10,000 mah charger that is about the same size as my phone. It seems well built, and reviews for it were all very good, and it is a trusted brand. It was definitely significantly less than $50 CAD (on sale, near 50 full price), but I do not remember the exact price. 

They might also have a bank that charges using a lightning cord, or type C,  instead of standard microUSB.
