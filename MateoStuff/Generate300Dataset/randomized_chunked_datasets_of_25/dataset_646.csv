73260,best Linux distro,"Worth pointing out that openSUSE will give you familiar experience if you are ""Windows Power User"". Mostly thanks to YaST. Otherwise, I would still recommend at least starting with anything Ubuntu based, especially  Mint or PopOS. Once you get to know how your system works and what you expect from system you might find distros for more advanced users, providing unique perks (openSUSE 's YaST, OBS and snapper, Arch 's AUR to name ones i know of)"
48957,best gaming monitor,"Be careful about telling people to get the GL850 for photo editing, especially if your primary still image output is for the web, then I wouldn't recommend a wide gamut monitor since what you will be seeing won't be reflected in what you post to the web in the 8-bit sRGB format, due to the majority of people using sRGB.

I work in photography so I have a wide gamut NEC digital image monitor, but my editing output is just for the web, so I have it set to sRGB. If I need any wide gamut output for CMYK printing or anything it would be a different story.

Anther problem is, mid to low end monitors do not do the wide gamut very well, as expressed by many experts, often even after calibration. However, some people love the overly saturated and extreme vibrance look that the wide gamut gives, but I wouldn't use it for photo editing for the web.

The most ideal workflow for photo editing would be, work from a raw data/RAW files, render that raw data in the widest gamut, highest bit depth you can, and then you would convert down to an sRGB image for the web or mobile devices."

33772,best electric car,"For limited use cases (on street parking) I can see where PHEVs have advantages over BEVs. But I've had a PHEV and it sucked compared to a BEV in basically every way. Even road trips in the BEV are more enjoyable than the PHEV.

Infrastructure won't get built for PHEVs. PHEVs don't make business sense to put DC Fast Charge capability into, so they can't use the chargers that are most needed for BEV adoption. PHEVs do not help the BEV road trip infrastructure, period. 

They may help convince more workplaces, apartments, malls, etc. to put in Level 2 AC charging, but that's not where the BEV infrastructure gap is."

There is no mention about the progress being used for uploads only downloads? There is mention of uploads prior but not related to progress %. Your article should point out that it's usable for uploads if it works with uploads as well?(Haven't gone over it yet, but it didn't look like it'd work to me)

There is [this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52422662/how-to-get-file-upload-progress-with-fetch-and-whatwg-streams) which points out why upload progress isn't usable with fetch(but is fine with downloads afaik), an answer links to two github issues that can resolve it, one of them is about ReadableStream which you use(so presumably upload progress with fetch works now?), yet the issue is still open.

According to [this issue](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/577), it's not suitable for HTTP1 servers only HTTP2(H2)? 

> It requires chunked encoding which pretty much limits it to h2. (You can't negotiate chunked encoding in h1.1 until after request has been sent, which is too late.)

Also browser support seems [a bit flakey still](https://caniuse.com/#feat=streams)(no good for IE, [experimental in FF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Using_readable_streams)). The spec seems to still be [under development](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/)? But the ReadableStream uploading part was [merged into spec almost 2 years ago](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/425)... so still seems to be handled better atm via axios."
