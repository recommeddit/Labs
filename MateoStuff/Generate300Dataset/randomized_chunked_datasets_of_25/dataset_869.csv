50572,"Well, it depends on whether you're considering production in the hip hop sense or the regular music sense, as either camp can hold widely different definitions. On a simple level though, production deals with the musical while mixing is the audio. 

Thus, a producer will perhaps write string parts, book horn musicians and generally decide which instruments are featured on a track to get it to achieve its potential. A mixer takes all of that and adjusts the levels in order to allow those sounds to not come across as messy and to ensure everything is fulfilling it's right role. The producer will liaison with the mixer in situations where he wants specific tracks serving specific roles (for example, he may have recorded a piano part which is only intended to beef up the guitar melody line, thus it doesn't need to sit clearly in the mix and can be pulled way back).
