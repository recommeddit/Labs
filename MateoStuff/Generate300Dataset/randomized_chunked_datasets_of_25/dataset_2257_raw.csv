"Putting grass under a coaster instead of concrete is still not themeing it. Have a look at Black Mamba (Phantasialand) or Blue Fire (Europapark). That is themeing! The coaster diving into dips and through caves, winding through the African desert like a snake or flashing through the scarce and rocky landscape of Iceland."
"Gotta do Wheel of Time if you haven't!  Adventuring all over a rich world, tons of different characters, epic battles, magic, and it will keep you busy for months!  I'm doing a reread right now and I can't get over how good it really is."
