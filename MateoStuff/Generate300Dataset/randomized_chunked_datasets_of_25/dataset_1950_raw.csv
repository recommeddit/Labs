Take a look at nord's trial before anything else honestly. That or mullvad.
"Not really.



She tells you they're all the same, so you choose the cheapest one. Or the one you think tastes better. It's not a nonanswer, they're all the same thing."
"If you liked Berseria, then Tales of Vesperia and Zestiria (Zest is related to Berseria and neat to find how it links)

and Ys VIII"
"Um what? Do you not know what baggage claim is? There aren't many people who put locks on bags that they're going to be carrying all the time. They put locks on the ones that will be put into the luggage compartment and they'll have to pick up from baggage claim. That's where the random people will be looking for their bag and then see a bag without a lock and ""check to see it's theirs"" before taking something and putting it back."
"Hey man! Just watched The guilty! Well it's not on my top 10 list, but damn, I would've never guessed that the mother was the one who killed the baby. I love these kind of plot twists, it gives you the information, and when the twist happens it's like a puzzle. It all makes sense. But you know what could've been an even better twist? If the mother would've left a message before she committed suicide, and the message would say something like that the father was actually the one who killed the baby, but he said he would kill her if she tells it to the police, and just like that, the father gets away. I hope you know what I mean, and thank you for your suggestion, it was a good film! 7/10!"

"Yeah that’s interesting because you could only look at 5 parks for each state unless you normalize based on one of them which is annoying. I wonder if there are any cases where a park outside the region would beat the 5 closest parks? Probably not, but it would be interesting to think about plotting all parks for each state to see if anything changes"
Mafia mystery and golf blitz sound great. I’m gonna check em out
"Best: name brand.  Bonus points for twix.

* The Documentary
* The Massacre
* The Chronic"
"Yea.  I think they are both classics, I just prefer IWW."
"Home Depot is better for most things.  Better deals on tools, cheaper delivery options, better framing lumber.  I grew up on HD and I'm often surprised by the lack of stuff lowe's has."
"I love accidentally slicing my friends' ankles open, too"
"and the 1080 is a more expensive shoe than the 880

but this is all gone"
"I live in a city that has some of the cleanest tap water in the US, most bottled water brands taste worse"
As You have watched so many what are your thoughts on the question?
Ben and Jerry's #1 selling flavor is Half Baked. It is also my favorite and can't believe not mentioned yet.
I found this book to be much of a theory without much of application. Felt that first chapter he sort of gave a very brief overview of the topics. Not something for new data scientist in the field
Nalgene. For some reason they always come empty...
I can see GKMC and TPAB going down as classics. Kendrick has skill.
Hey! I've also been creating custom categories on Personal Capital (such as Lyft instead of just Travel). Do you know if there's a way to automatically have future Lyft transactions labeled as my custom category Lyft?
"Well now Persol got acquired so be careful, might only be a matter of time"
