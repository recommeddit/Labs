"$400... budget... half the cars I've owned in my life cost less than $400, so we must be thinking different. My take is that if $400 is not much money to you, you probably aren't concerned with cost."
Honestly one of the most iconic video and video series in YouTube history imo
"You either have to understand that progress is going to slow down and drink a fuckton of water which means you won't get a buzz going most likely or even come close to being drunk. Or you only drink on off days from the gym. My only day for drinking for awhile will be Saturday afternoon/evenings and even at that point, they won't be frequent. All in the name of the cut."
Voi vittu saatana!

"I think I've read everything she's written except for her MF romance. Did you already read the short stories in the Charm of Magpies series? ""Interlude with Tattoos"" is absolutely amazing. ""Jackdaw"" is set in the same world and allows you to see Stephen Day from another perspective. I don't listen to audiobooks very often so I have no idea how Audible credit work. While I love all of her work, the Charm of Magpies series is by far my absolute favourite. ""Band Sinister"", a stand-alone, is also highly recommended."
