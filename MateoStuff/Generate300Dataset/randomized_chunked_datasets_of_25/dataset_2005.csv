72970,best Linux distro,"Distrowatch is _not_ a measure of popularity. I blogged about it explaining why. https://popey.com/blog/2021/01/distrowatch-is-not-a-measure-of-popularity/

In short it's two things. 1) Because they count internal links, so they publish an article about a distro, or there's a new distro release, that links to the page, the numbers go up. 2) Being at the top of the list means you get clicked, and that (stupidly) counts to push you up. You're at the top? You're staying there."

54814,best water filter,If you want a pure water then I'd suggest a distiller. They'll last a long time as well as you can usually fix any of it if you're handy. Only downside is no nutrients or minerals in your water. But nothing like Fluoride either. A lot of filters are just for taste FYI. Be sure you're looking into the filter type and if its doing what you want it to do. Distiller is the only way to get pure water.
