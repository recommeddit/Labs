I wear Rose Jam from Lush and it's amazing. Their body spray products are gorgeous and stay on you for the whole day after a few sprays.
Foiled again! If it wasn't for you meddling kids
"Ouch, hope you can have surgery for that ;)

One can also make a board from reclaimed wood from scaffolding. Important thing is that the grain is in the length, and you have to put it with the grain vertically."
"I live in WV and I'm far closer to Hershey, KW, Knoebels, Dorney, KD, BGW, SFGAd, and probably even Waldameer and even CP.....  Even Carowinds might be closer.

Then again, I don't think Martinsburg counts for this argument ☺"
Escada Magnetism. If it's not $25 or less then it's damn near close.
Socially Awkward Piglet
So many good ones already listed may I add 'House of Games' - (1987) David Mamet - Joe Mantegna stars. Less of a mind mess but I found it really intriguing as far as twists.
Mud Mouth by Yela (I know unpopular opinion)
"Drink dickloads of fluids, eat healthy food, get decent sleep and pray"
5s had the best design and best feel in the hand. But my current 11 is obviously the best. I absolutely love it.
"What do you think about these fish?

"if only there were a section for top free plan

"I mean... Milky Way is just a neutered Snickers, so most things > Milky Way."
"Yeah, sometimes it's wrong though and I'll spend twice as long looking thinking ""I must be staring right at it"""
I know eh?! My roommate and I found a box at our grocery store and bought it solely because it had the gorilla on the box!
"STOP PUTTING SHIT ON OUR BODIES DAVID BLAINE

If Infinity War doesn't have a scene where Dr. Strange turns Iron Man's soda into cheez-its what even is the point of the MCU."
I’m on the iOS app
This is disturbing af.
I would recommend either sun and moon or ultra sun and moon. They are the newest entries and are easy to jump into.
One of the best hotel pools ever and the best location.
"Oh, no, I'm looking for similar movies to the 3 in the title. Sorry for the confusion!"
Under 1k dollars
For a subtle scent (that will only be noticeable when someone gets close to you) I recommend Burberry Touch.
Arrowhead. It tastes like they pay people to fart in every bottle the very moment before its sealed.
"History majors aren't quite as hard to find a job, IF you know how to package your skill set. A good school will teach you about specific subjects, sure, but the skills of how to do research are going to be valuable in a number of fields. I know that the FBI and CIA have recruited among History majors, for instance. Highly recommend getting other languages under you belt as well. History dovetails nicely with a lot of other fields, so consider double majoring, if you have the fortitude for that much work. Also, for heavens sake, try to get an internship in somewhere while you are in school."
