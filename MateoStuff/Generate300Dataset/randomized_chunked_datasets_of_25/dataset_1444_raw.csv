"A shoehorn. So simple and cheap, and instantly turns 5 seconds of the most annoying wriggling and forcing into a 1 second maneuver. I'm amazed they seem to have gone out of style.

Also, a fire extinguisher on every level of your house."
"Yeah, fetch is both readable and scalable. Built right in!"
"Vivaldi, hands down"
"Hard to choose just five, but some of my all time favorites would be:

* The City and the Stars - Arthur C. Clarke
* Blindsight - Peter Watts
* Diaspora - Greg Egan
* Dragon's Egg - Robert L. Forward
* Roadside Picnic - Arkady Strugatsky"
"IMO, the creativity and fun spirit of Pokemon was gone after Gen 3. Pokemon became just another corporate moneymaker with orders to churn out content and make cash. Monster designs and anything resembling 'heart' or 'charm' was gone when they just started scribbling random lines, adding an eyeball to it and calling it a new monster. 

This is, of course, highly subjective. I was among the first wave of U.S. Pokemon players for the original Red / Blue version release, so am probably looking at it with some level of nostalgia. I played Fire Red as an adult, and found that it managed to hold my attention, even after years of my tastes in video games maturing."
"Unfortunately I will be back in KÃ¸benhavn, Denmark by that time."
"Ron Jeremy. He's surprisingly very quiet and sweet.

Edit: I was feeling a bit awkward that I had a Ron Jeremy dildo at home in my pleasure chest and didn't know if I should tell him or not.

I also met Bridget the Midget. She stripped at a super bowl party I went to right after she got her fake boobs. She was very nice as well!"
The Youtube comment sections are always pretty cultish. Those chefs are rockstars to their fans.
"If you go somewhere that can make it, get a moscow Mule. In a copper cup, preferably."
"Axios is all I ever learned,  haven't hit a situation where it hasn't worked perfect yet."
That is more data than I've read on this matter to date. Thank you for this.
"plane is like prison, store everything of value in ass. got that."
"> If your toothless and twitchy, you're probably not getting any.

If that was the case I'd completely understand. I normally look pretty respectable, but I swear that day I was turned away because I didn't look healthy. It wasn't a drugged-up daze, it was goddamn influenza."
That's usually my goal. Best way to avoid a hangover is to never stop drinking.
I've had the same pair of Ray-Bans for 5 years. A lot of people I know have had pairs for much longer than I have. I think you underestimate the construction quality of them. Are they overpriced? Probably. But I will never ever buy cheapos again. It's not cost effective if I have to keep buying multiple pairs a year...
The ending of The Mist definitely.
"Just to nitpick, it starts at 27 inch, then 32 inch"
Someone needs to build this and make it a r/coolguides
Am I crazy for thinking jalen Ramsey should be top ten
"Maybe you want to put Shadow of the Colossus on this list. It is Playstation 2/3 exclusive, i've never played it, but i heard it is pretty great."
"With Excel: you definitely want to stick to the industry standard.   
When you go outside the norm, it might be great for certain reasons or applications but overall in terms of support (being able to simply google how to do X or Y will be the easiest in excel over anything else).  


It just makes your life easier to stick to industry-standard software unless you have a specific reason not to."

"OPKS is soul crushing, all of the East Coast SPG hotels I've stayed in have been awesome."
All Caps gets me every time
