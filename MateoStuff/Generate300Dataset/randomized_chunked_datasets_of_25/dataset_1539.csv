38241,best newspapers to read,"Came here to say that and the BBC.

Oh wait...

Ok, how about CSM and the Economist? Also the NYT as long as you realize they only cover what they feel is relevant from a leftist perspective, and their opinion pages are just worthless drivel, about on par with Fox News."

25455,best cricket teams of all time,"Sure, except Afridi has a significantly better bowling strike rate compared to
Qadir. In fact his strike rate is second only to Ajmal amongst major Pakistani spinners. (66 vs. 65). That slight difference is massively offset by a batting average of 36. 

Razzaq on the other hand, you’re probably right about. Underwhelming career with a few great match winning innings. 

As for trusting the top 7, in modern cricket many Test wins have been anchored by the lower order. 
Pakistan on the verge of a historic test loss to Zimbabwe, and Wasim and Saqlain come together and put on 412 runs. Many other examples like that. Look at the countless examples of England wins due to substantial scores by their 8,9,10 bats. I do think batting should matter in all time teams."

29691,best game console,"I personally think Asura's Wrath deserves a spot. I watched an entire playthrough years ago and I've wanted to play it since. Combat's pretty fun, and its storyline is pretty neat too. Good cinematics, epic boss fights, all around great."
64980,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Recently discovered the Banh Mi sandwich from 4 Eggs and Pizza, one of my new favorites.  

I also enjoy the hardshell asada tacos from Monys, brussel sprouts from the Lark, either wings from Sama Sama, and BBQ chicken pizza from Yellow Belly. 

Oh and chicken chipotle club sandwich or Mexican chicken Cesar salad from South Coast Deli"
5744,best programming language for web development,"Sorry this took so long.  This assumes you know how to build a basic website and use javascript.  It helps if you know a bit of some other language.  You will be doing a lot of googling of keywords as you move through this.  Don't be daunted - this wall of text is the sum of 4 years of college and 7 years experience as a developer.  I did not learn all of this at once or even in a year.  Go through it slowly and you will find sections to skip and others that change before you get there.  ""When I was your age"" we didn't have PowerShell or Puppet or Octopus.  We didn't have things like Ruby that forces MVC on us.  We didn't have JSON and we barely had XML.  Shit below may not exist or be relevant when you get to it, so don't worry!

Query:  Get data from a non-code source and load it into your code.  This can be a file via a FileStream or a database via a SQL or JSON via <plethora of ways to generate JSON here>.   Traditionally, you must know a bare minimum of SQL, but JSON is growing much more prominent in classical settings.   SQL:  learn the following key words:  select from table view where group by order by insert update delete.  Once you can use a database and get the data you want out, you can move on to... 

Basic table and view design, normalization/denormalization:  This is how to store your data and link it together.  You could build a giant spreadsheet with duplicate data all over the place but with minor effort you can build much better systems that respond faster and grow easier.  Bob has 5 siblings.  Do you store Bob, Sibling1, Sibling 2, etc on one row?  Do you store Bob, Sibling# 5 times?  Or do you store 6 people and relate them together in a second table?  This is called normalization.  Views are simply shortcuts to groups of tables so your code doesn't have to have dozens of rows of sql.  You can also change views without changing your code or your tables.  This is the most a basic web developer needs to know in order to not be looked at with scorn :P  Once you can build a few tables, populate them with data, and query them, you are ready for....

Loading all of this from code:  Keywords to google (in Java and C#, not sure about other languages):  SQLConnection, SQLCommand, ExecuteScalar, ExecuteQuery, Connection strings, DataTable.  Write a console application that connects to your database, grabs some data, and then loads it into class objects.  Once you have this, you are ready for...

Whatever floats your boat in between:  C#, Java, Python, Ruby.  Doesn't matter.  Pick one you think is interesting and has a lot of references.  Learn how to connect to your database with it.  Learn how to interact with a user with it.  When you have an application that can take user information in a text box and store it in the database, you are ready for...

MVC (or related patterns):  Model View Controller.  Google it, learn it, master it.  View:  HTML/Javascript.  Model: JSON or custom class to hold data.  Controller:  Pure code doing almost all the work.  Think of it this way:  You are the boss of a graphic design firm.  You have a lot of employees who are extremely good at drawing but have no clue how to run a business or talk to customers. You have interns who are just happy to be here holding their pencils, running errands, and other menial tasks so the artists stay working.  This is MVC.  The Views (artists) do nothing but interact with the user by rendering images and content.  When the user clicks on the of the buttons, the Views (artists) just tell the Controller (you aka boss) which button was clicked.  You then ask the Models (interns) what is going on, make a decision, and tell the Views (artists) your decisions.  By doing it this way you can separate your design decisions (image goes here, this is a radio button instead of a checkbox, etc) from your code decisions without either impacting the other severely.  Once you understand this idea, you are ready for:

UNIT TESTING!!11!:  Unit tests are about writing code to prove your code does stuff properly.  MVC's entire point is to allow you to do MORE testing without getting tangled in image manipulation or layout problems.  When you wrote your first Hello World! application, how can you prove it wrote Hello World! instead of HELLO WORLD! or helloworld1?  Unit tests prove that it did exactly what you intended.  When you change your code, your unit test is still there in the background and will still prove your change didn't impact anything that was working before.  When you make a change and tests start bombing, you can ask yourself if the change you made should have been made at all or if you did it wrong or if your code is built properly if such a small change destroyed so many tests.  They are important as soon as you build anything that can go wrong and impact users.  Tests aren't perfect but they prove that at least parts of your application work properly BEFORE the user gets it.  They also let you debug better - build a test that duplicates the scenario that is breaking, then code the test to work, THEN fix your code.  When the test passes, you're done.   Once you understand and have a few tests, you are ready for...

Proper repository practices:  Now you're awesome at web design and you get hired onto a team.  How do you make code changes without impacting what other people are doing?  Repositories.  GIT/SVN/Mercurial are the popular three.  You need to learn how to commit your code, how version control and merges work, as well as other key words such as branch, tag, trunk, pull, checkout, etc.  You ~MUST~ know this in order to work on a team.

Proper deployment practices:  How do you get your code onto a production (public-facing) server?  How do you ensure the code that is ready gets deployed but the code you are still working on doesn't?  What if there's a bug in production but you can't reproduce it locally?  What if after deployment the site doesn't work?  Deployment practices are about ensuring what you do locally works on production.  In a large firm you are not allowed to change production servers.  Ever.  Someone else does it, and they have no idea what you did.  ""Oh I forgot to set this web server config file so the website works""  Too bad, you're fired.  Every worksite is different, but there are tools that automate deployment you can learn to get a head start.  Heroku uses some by default and my workplace uses Octopus.  There is also Puppet and a few others.  None of them are necessarily better than the others but they all teach you how to get things into a production server without manipulating config files or dlls by hand."
63013,Best online React course,"I’m fairly new to react myself so I can’t comment much on other courses, but I am taking the Udemy course you linked. I find it great, he starts from a clean slate and it’s always easy to follow along but your knowledge increases. Seeing how long the course is it can be daunting but so far it’s well worth it. The course costs nothing more than buying lunch and it offers 35 hours of quality content. I’m only around a third in but I feel so much more confident in my react knowledge compared to when I tried other tutorials/courses"
33680,best electric car,"Yeah, getting a used one could be a good play - they're supposed to be rated at 500k+ (or was it 750k?) miles, so once the initial depreciation hits it should be a solid value (which it is already)."
1624,best ice cream flavor,"Oh wow thank you!  I absolutely love cheese so the gorgonzola is probably going to be my next endeavor.  I really wanted to do a parm one but I couldn't find a good recipe.  

I am incredibly grateful for these recipes!  Thank you!"

54490,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"So I also do cs and Val... But I use all these for it. Personally, I like soft just a touch more as xsoft is definitely usable, but for me my arm tends to sink into the pad a bit too much."
554,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"You can use OneNote for PDFs, the key is keeping the sections short. If it's under 20-30 pages it'll work great. I usually break textbooks or handouts into chunks."

30697,best country to live in,If God wanted to give the earth an enema he would stick it in Queensland!
13737,best research paper archive,Yeah.  Entanglement is a funny thing.  I never understood why you can write the wavefunctions in the way that you do if you know what I am talking about.  It just seems like cheating sometimes :)
3725,best college for research,I was never able to trust the Guardian's ranking simply because it jumped so much from year to year. I always preferred the Times'.

2579,best headphones,"To some extent you are right, but value also hugely depends on where you live. 

I'll explain what I mean with an example. For example my neighbors in Canada have really crap headphone pricing, and if you look at the same gear, my my ""sweet spot"" here in the US is typically far sweeter than their ""sweet spot"" up in the frozen arctic tundra they call home :-)"
42511,best detective show,"I don't recall if it's still on Netflix or if BBC took it back, but the Sherlock Holmes with Martin Freeman and Bendadit Cucumberpatch was amazing. Short seasons, super long episodes, but could be a good binge for a week/weekend."
10538,best suitcase lock,"really? how would they know, or do they just wait and see if you have the correct permits/paperwork?  maybe something like a 50bmg bottle opener?"
