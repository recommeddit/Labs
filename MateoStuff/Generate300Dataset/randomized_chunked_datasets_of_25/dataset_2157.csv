For years people have been debating that it was only a matter of time before the big dogs shifted towards electric and it is game over for Tesla. I feel that we are about to get to that point in 2021/2022."

60239,best freezer brand,"I've been using both types for many years. 

An upright, be it frost free or not has only one advantage over a chest freezer, and that is the ability to easily see and reach everything that is in it. The upright freezer has a big flaw though, and that is that with all the shelves and their brackets, and ""compartments"" protruding from the inside of the door, you will find that a ton of the volume, (maybe a third) is geometrically unusable. So the practical usefulness of a 15 cubic foot freezer might approach 10 cubic feet.

While being frost free saves a once or twice a year job, those type freezers are as dry as a desert, and anything you store in there that isn't well vacuum sealed in heavy plastic, (think the packaging on bacon) will dry out and get freezer burn. No other packaging method that you can do on your counter will be safe from this.

The biggest problem that a chest freezer has is the tendency of things to accumulate on the bottom where they are a pain in the butt to reach. You prevent this by storing things in shallow boxes or tupperware type boxes that you stand on edge in the bottom layer of the freezer. This means that you never have to reach further than halfway in to the freezer to remove something.

Defrosting a chest freezer is not the chore it's made out to be. You can do it very passively by removing the contents to a table, stacking things compactly, and covering the whole thing with a couple blankets or a quilt. In the couple of hours that your freezer then sits with the power off and the lid open, softening the ice, those items under the quilt will survive. Things don't defrost that quickly. After a couple of hours of the freezer being open, the ice will be soft enough that a butter knife will pry it free in big sheets, and  you gather it off the bottom with a dust pan or a piece of cardboard.

I never do it passively though. After I make my pile of goods under the quilt, I attack the ice with a hair dryer. It only takes about ten minutes to soften the ice enough to pry it loose with the butter knife, (a butter knife won't poke any holes in the metal sides of the freezer wall, so don't be chicken) then repack and and restart. It's not an all day job by any means.

Lots of chest freezers come with a defrosting ""heater element"" built into the walls. There will be a button, usually on the underside of the lid, or near a top corner of the freezer wall that you pull out, that quickly warms the wall of the freezer enough to coax the ice off in big pieces. This works as quickly as my hair dryer method. 

Chest freezers also have the advantage of being extremely simple machines, and with no moving parts can be expected to work for a couple of generations.

Oh, and if you have kids and an upright freezer, you can be sure that a couple times a year you are going to find that someone left the freezer door open."
9661,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Pretty much everyone will tell you that whatever dorm they were in is the best one.

Except for Santa Catalina (FT), that one seems to be about 50/50.  To go with this though, the half that love it absolutely love it and the half that don't absolutely hate it, so depending on what half you fall in it could be good or bad.  Unless you really don't mind waking up early to ride a mile to class, I would just avoid it.

Despite that though, everything is going to be pretty similar.  Every dorm has parties, every dorm has chill people that don't necessarily want to party, and every dorm (except FT) is within walking distance of class.  Sure you might have to take an elevator or multiple flights of stairs down some of them, but that just means you get a cooler view.

I personally was in Santa Rosa and thought it was fine.  It's technically the closest to main campus (although the difference is negligible), and has a gym and a decent rec room.  Other dorms had slightly newer carpets and whatnot, but the furnishing is pretty much the same everywhere.  Any difference in room size is also negligible (they're all fucking tiny).

And a little unsolicited advice: whatever you do, don't buy the biggest meal plan you can.  The dining commons are the worst part of the dorm experience, and really the only negative I had with the whole thing.  Sure, you'll be fine with it at first (""All you can eat; FUCK YEAH!""), but give it two weeks and you'll be begging for another cup-noodle to avoid a dreaded trip to the DLG.  As the dean of students once told me: ""It ain't cheap, but it sure tastes like it is!"""
