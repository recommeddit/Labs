"Met Johnny Depp and didn't realize it until the next day, and he was awesome and shook my hand and everything.

I was at Comic Con and saw an amazing Captain Jack Sparrow. I complimented him because his costume looked exactly like the one from the movie. He replied by shaking my hand and then asking me, in the perfect voice ""What costume?"" and then swaggering off with the same sort of walk he used in the movie. I thought I had just met the best cosplayer ever, then I saw on the news the next morning that Johnny Depp had been at the convention walking the floor in the original movie costume.

"I have to buy SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) free toothpaste due to the fact that I have canker sores that are exacerbated by the detergents found in most toothpaste. I have to spend a bit more as a result.  

I dont really see another reason to spend more than a buck per tube on toothpaste, though. That ultra-brite stuff at walmart is just as good as colgate."

"Sigh, yes. I still think about it and it’s been 3 months since I’ve read it. The way she develops Liberty’s story... I felt like I knew her. Like really knew her. Her childhood scenes were so real."
"I mostly read historical romance and I really love Julia Quinn, Eloisa James, Sarah MacLean and Tessa Dare. Alyssa Cole's Reluctant Royals series is a very cute contemporary. Sarah Maclean's website and the website Smart Bitches Trashy Books are great places to get recommendations."
I wash my hands with 100% sulphuric acid. Its the only way to be sure and it gives a nice refreshing tingling feeling on my hands.

"I don't mean to diss craft brewing, there are some craft beers I really like, to me it was just the fact that he was whining that somebody didn't think to buy him his own special expensive beer at a college party. If somebody offered me a beer I didn't like, I'd just say no thanks, but I guess he felt like he was owed the particular beer he liked. I asked what beers he'd prefer, and why, and he couldn't even articulate what he liked about other beers, he just felt insulted at the free beer being, in his mind, cheap.

Edit- Now that I think of it, I'd met him once before that, and got into an argument with him over what ethnicity I am. Guy's weird."

It’s not as good as it once was. It’s sad because it used to be really good.
