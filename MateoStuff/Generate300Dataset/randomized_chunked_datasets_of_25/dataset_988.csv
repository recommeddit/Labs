66073,best college in california,I am at a loss for why you are at a loss for why students have to do extra work for free money. Literally the easiest money they'll ever get. There is also the CSU system. It's even more affordable.

60124,best freezer brand,"Larger commercial freezers aren't happy unless they have stuff in them, and they're huge and noisy (and will sometimes require repair anyway.) Buy consumer stuff.

23481,best car racing video game,"Yeah, I used to love to play driving games.. but basically when I get my first supercar that's ""finished the game"" for me, so all the newer driving games are like an hour long. Once I have something that goes 200mph there's nowhere left to go. 

And trying to wrestle some piece of crap like a Chrysler Sebring with a turbo slapped on it around corners is the best part, anyway, unless it's getting some upgraded suspension parts and new tires on it so wrestling it around those corners becomes a bit easier.

If I want to drive a futuristic rocketship I'll go play F-Zero GX again."
