45251,"Honestly, PC is your go-to gaming system for all round general purpose. You can use gamepads on it for a more relaxed experience and you're going to be able to get ~most~ games.

If you want to go the console route though, just take a look at the exclusives and choose that way. If no exclusives entice you towards something, then go in to a game store and just hold some controllers, what feels best in your hands? 

Personally I like the PS controllers over all the others, it's small and light, but I've also grown up with only PlayStation's, so the size of it just feels normal to me. I've met a lot of people who hate the PS controller though. It really just comes down to preference.

And if all those things don't matter then I guess just go for something people you know use, so you have people to play with.

Pretty much all consoles now require you to pay for online function, AFAIK Nintendo Switch is the cheapest for online, something like ¬£20 for the entire year. So maybe let that come in to consideration if you want to be playing online.

Sorry it's a very ""you need to choose"" response, but overall no one apart from you is going to be able to tell you what games you want to play, what controller you prefer etc.",best gaming system

Tip I use all the time: search for a paper on Google Scholar. On the results page under each hit there is an 'All X versions' link. Click that and it will show you all the places the article is posted on the web, often will have several free PDFs.",best research paper archive

16537,"Do you plan on having more kids? If the answer is yes I would definitely NOT get another pet. I personally don't think it's wise to get a 2 year old their own pet. Little kids can easily hurt or injure small pets and it's not fair for the child or the pet. With 2 cats and a toddler it sounds like you have your hands full. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

If you insist, thoroughly research this. I know for a fact that rabbits are especially bad for little kids but I'd be really surprised if any reputable sources recommended that 2 year olds handle small animals.",best pet for toddlers
