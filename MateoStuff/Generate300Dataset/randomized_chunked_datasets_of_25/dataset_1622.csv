45251,best gaming system,"Honestly, PC is your go-to gaming system for all round general purpose. You can use gamepads on it for a more relaxed experience and you're going to be able to get ~most~ games.

If you want to go the console route though, just take a look at the exclusives and choose that way. If no exclusives entice you towards something, then go in to a game store and just hold some controllers, what feels best in your hands? 

Personally I like the PS controllers over all the others, it's small and light, but I've also grown up with only PlayStation's, so the size of it just feels normal to me. I've met a lot of people who hate the PS controller though. It really just comes down to preference.

And if all those things don't matter then I guess just go for something people you know use, so you have people to play with.

Pretty much all consoles now require you to pay for online function, AFAIK Nintendo Switch is the cheapest for online, something like ¬£20 for the entire year. So maybe let that come in to consideration if you want to be playing online.

Sorry it's a very ""you need to choose"" response, but overall no one apart from you is going to be able to tell you what games you want to play, what controller you prefer etc."
67209,axios alternatives reddit,"this isnt strictly react related, but its used by enough React devs (heck even [the current #2 post uses axios](https://reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/dckm1j/after_wrestling_with_managing_network_request/)) that it bears some awareness and discussion, scare title included (i would change it if i could)

Leaving it up but please be kind to each other and respectful of how open source works - maintenance is unpaid and community alternatives and forks can arise due to disagreements with project governance."

53606,best medicine for a cold,"Peppermint oil is actually not bad for clearing sinuses. It‚Äôs not the magic panacea hippies claim it to be, but it‚Äôll run some of the snot out of you and make your sinuses tingle to distract you from the congestion."
45460,best gaming system,"PC because it‚Äôs easier to have one set up than multiple consoles, I‚Äôve seen the chaos of consoles because my brother collects them, plus I tend to favor games on steam and the only consoles I have are handheld, old psp, 2DS,  and Nintendo because my dad loves Nintendo and bought himself, and subsequently us, all the nintendo consoles.

Basically cause one pc has fewer cables than a dozen consoles"

38219,best newspapers to read,"Accuracy is not the issue. All newspapers are accurate (except the shitty local newspapers that don't even hire real journalists and just source all their important stories from AP). The editors' personal politics does bias any newspaper, not in the content of the information but in what is chosen to be included and excluded on any given newsday."

13579,best research paper archive,"Not legal to publicly distribute, but you should be able to privately send it to others. At least in my field, it's very common for researchers to post some form of the article on their website (journals don't have copyright over the preprint version, which is basically the word doc we submit to them which they then copyedit and make prettier).

Tip I use all the time: search for a paper on Google Scholar. On the results page under each hit there is an 'All X versions' link. Click that and it will show you all the places the article is posted on the web, often will have several free PDFs."

16537,best pet for toddlers,"Do you plan on having more kids? If the answer is yes I would definitely NOT get another pet. I personally don't think it's wise to get a 2 year old their own pet. Little kids can easily hurt or injure small pets and it's not fair for the child or the pet. With 2 cats and a toddler it sounds like you have your hands full. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

If you insist, thoroughly research this. I know for a fact that rabbits are especially bad for little kids but I'd be really surprised if any reputable sources recommended that 2 year olds handle small animals."
