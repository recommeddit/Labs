It's using the same 2.4 GHz as the dongle Cloud Flight uses, yet it can't handle good quality voice calls. It's baffling to me.",best headphones

17490,"Detention - This game is so thought provoking and deep by the time you realise what is fully going on i don’t think I’ve felt so reflective over a game ever, it is also educational into past and present day. Not for the soft at heart and it is an adult game based on the content and story.

KOF 2012- This is such an underrated game but one of the best fighters, and whilst the graphics aren’t great the game runs really smooth on mobile.

Journey - Do I need to say anymore, timeless piece of art game and perfect port.

Hyper light drifter - Again a great artistic game with lots of character and soul

Alien Blackout - Very good game for mobile and intense gameplay, fun but daunting, great graphics and atmosphere

Taiko pop tap - so fun, great gameplay, graphics and new upgrades for songs to keep on coming back, very Japanese

Mo Astray - Another deep and thought provoking game, strange and interesting, excellent gameplay, tricky puzzles, great artwork

Under Depths of fear - Intense and atmospheric game, very good graphics and sound work, truly quite scary

Secret of Mana - The original and one of the best rpgs ever 

Absolute Drift - simple but fun and addictive car drifting game, great art style",best iOS game

Mongo is a good starting point for NoSQL.

Postgres and MySQL are good for SQL.

Good luck!",best programming language for web development
