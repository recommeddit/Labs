20991,best workout music,"Kanye West - POWER

Kanye West ft. Jay Z & Swizz Beatz - POWER Remix"
27435,best bollywood actor,Maybe because the story of the movie is good enough that they don’t have to act that well
42719,best detective show,"Watching the last episode right now, haha"
5183,best home improvement store,I'm pretty sure a lot of their house brand stuff comes off the exact same assembly lines as Harbor Freight.
47279,best state to visit in the United States,There are some cool spots in Hollywood. Hollywood Blvd sucks though.
44746,best items under $100,"Some recent ones that come to mind:

- **A good shower head**: Makes a world of difference. 
- **Motion sensing night lights**: Don't step on things at night, don't wake up my partner by turning on the lights
- Honeywell **humidifiers**: Sleep much better
- **Remote case for Apple TV remote**: Protects the device, red colour to make it easy to find, magnetic so I can attack it to side of coffee table
- **Kitchen torch**: Creme brulee away!
- **Waterproof bluetooth speaker**: Attach it to the wall, listen to podcasts and music in the shower.
- **Quality umbrella**: Got tired of buying $15 ones that barely last a season. 
- **Inexpensive souvenirs** from travels: Photos are nice but we love having small things around the house that remind us of the memories we had is priceless."

I havent look at that Deep Learning with R, but I have been slowly working through this from MIT press:[deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)"

35343,best alcoholic drink,There it is. Shotgun one and I’m good for the night. Completely trashed.
35337,best alcoholic drink,Apple cider & Fireball.
30115,best Mexican war to study,"Afterwards England also forbid settlement West of the Appalachian mountains to reserve it for native people, which upset colonists (even though they ignored it mostly)"
2764,best headphones,"What I can't understand is where that limitation comes from. Why can't Bluetooth introduce a profile that combines A2DP with the way, way outdated HFP?

It's using the same 2.4 GHz as the dongle Cloud Flight uses, yet it can't handle good quality voice calls. It's baffling to me."
8025,best laptop for general use,"Does battery life or weight matter to you? If they don't matter to you, the Zephyrus G14 is not your best option."
47158,best state to visit in the United States,"If you want good BBQ I recommend Kansas City, Missouri or St Louis, Missouri."
58744,best cologne,"I usually go with your second approach listed. I've actually got a ""rainy day"" cologne that I think works really well with the subdued atmosphere of gray clouds and wet air. Usually cold summer days don't get an absolute winter fragrance, tho, because it's not truly cold outside."
69870,best major to study in college,"Learn GIS and basic computer science.

Thank me later.

I knew a ton of Environmental majors in College. You will want to learn that technology , specifically ArcMap"
63257,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,Can’t you get it through Unc0ver Dark?
53887,best medicine for a cold,None of that shit will work fast enough to take care of your issues. All it does anyway is slightly lesson the symptoms.
27266,best stocks to buy,The experience of going into their stores sucks. Feels like they're stuck in the 80s. But touché on their other revenue streams.
45112,best items under $100,"If you like the look and the sound, a guitar tech can make it play good. A general setup for a guitar isn’t that expensive and makes a world of difference."
17490,best iOS game,"Detention - This game is so thought provoking and deep by the time you realise what is fully going on i don’t think I’ve felt so reflective over a game ever, it is also educational into past and present day. Not for the soft at heart and it is an adult game based on the content and story.

KOF 2012- This is such an underrated game but one of the best fighters, and whilst the graphics aren’t great the game runs really smooth on mobile.

Journey - Do I need to say anymore, timeless piece of art game and perfect port.

Hyper light drifter - Again a great artistic game with lots of character and soul

Alien Blackout - Very good game for mobile and intense gameplay, fun but daunting, great graphics and atmosphere

Taiko pop tap - so fun, great gameplay, graphics and new upgrades for songs to keep on coming back, very Japanese

Mo Astray - Another deep and thought provoking game, strange and interesting, excellent gameplay, tricky puzzles, great artwork

Under Depths of fear - Intense and atmospheric game, very good graphics and sound work, truly quite scary

Secret of Mana - The original and one of the best rpgs ever 

Absolute Drift - simple but fun and addictive car drifting game, great art style"
52715,best hiphop album,"don't get me wrong, madvillainy is great but i would not put that in my GOAT list

edit: i mean madvillainy's even in my name, but that's because it introduced me to DOOM"
72804,best wireless lightweight mouse,model d soon maybe the skoll and hati will be to small.
5689,best programming language for web development,"Really depends. After you get through the religious wars of SQL v. NoSQL, then you have a whole shitload of other factors to consider. 

Mongo is a good starting point for NoSQL.

Postgres and MySQL are good for SQL. 

But keep in mind that different DBs solve different problems. 

Good luck!"
