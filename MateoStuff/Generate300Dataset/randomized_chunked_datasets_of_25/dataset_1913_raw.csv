"You are counting how many students get into the career or how many finish it??? Because they have something like 2000 people on its 1st year but by the second it may just be 500. 

Anyone can enter med school there. Not to many finish it. 

Not saying it is a bad thing btw, it gives a chance to many people."
Charisma!
50 points for Slytherin
I loved how accurately it depicted life in a video game. Stuff like all the NPCs only being able to say generic pre-assigned lines. I never would’ve thought of that.
"The best white russians IMO are made with E&J brandy (u/rogue_epileptic mentioned it in their suggestion) instead of vodka. E&J is trash if you want actual brandy but if you want sweet caramel flavor in a brandy-proof spirit, it's your goto. In particular, use their XO release.

It kills ANY of the vodka booziness that normal white russians can have if they are too spirit-heavy, so it should be useful for u/itssarakang.

Other people have almost mentioned completely cutting out the cream/milk and doing a shaken egg (dry shake or reverse dry shake preferably) and I can confirm that it improves the drink substantially.

Best part is that E&J costs next to nothing. The Kahlua is what will cost all the money."
"This may be the best Reddit topic on r/AskScience I've seen in a while! I have  [Kaila, Ville. ""Natural Selection for least action""](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/464/2099/3055.full) where natural selection is described using physics terms, the law of least action and the 2nd law of thermodynamics."

"I remember liking David Beckham signature for him, but it lasts like 2 minutes"
Where Eagles Dare is a fantastic film!
Juhi chawla and kajol. Not many actress in B'wood are as good at comedy as these two and their dialouge delivery was fantastic throughout.
Triangle is awesome. Also the original Total Recall is perfect.
"This was a lifesaver for me. I made a special trip to my office once mandated work from home started in March because I NEED it. After I got it, I got some weird looks from office mates but started to see them picking them up too."
"Nevermind, grows too wide.  I need 20ft tall and narrow"
"I don't believe that Mac's went out of business because of the quality of their food, I believe it was a family decision to spend time with kids. I thought their fish and chips was great and also was the only place I can think of to get haggis in town. Or mushy peas."
Dunno bout King's Dead. I couldn't imagine working out with that Future verse
Dragon age Inquisition is really good too. A bit dated now though
"I've never gotten the impression that this sub was bigoted in any way and I say this as a Filipino-American. 

I agree with you that this sub does have a certain provinciality; I'm also a member of my local science fiction association and the taste is quite different. I've brought up Tom Sweterlitsch and Greg Egan with them and not many people had read them. I learned of both here, and I'm quite happy with that."
"Congrats, I guess you won the contest this time."
"LTP: If you smell piss but cant find any piss, it could be a small electrical fire somewhere. Or it is actually piss, either way you should find it."
