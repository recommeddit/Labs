35014,best NFL player,They forgot to include Ray Lewis‚Äô  DPOY from 2000.  All it takes is to take a quick look at the Wiki page come on man.

46856,best hand santizer brand,"One thing people forget is that the only way you can get the H1N1 flu (or any other upper respiratory illness) from your hands, is if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose with those dirty paws.

Try and limit touching those areas, especially when you aren't sure if your hands are clean.  (ie after shaking hands, etc.)

You can walk around all day with your hands covered in H1N1 and won't get it, as long as you don't touch those areas.  Which is very hard to do in fact.  You touch your eyes, mouth and nose much more than you probably realize."

54730,best water filter,"ZeroWater is the best. The filters last forever, I probably only change it once a year and I use it for everything every day. Yes, I use the tester. Currently having issues with contaminates in city water so my tap isn't really safe to drink. ZeroWater is the only one that filters nitrates besides a reverse osmosis system."
8792,best toothpaste,Is charcoal toothpaste good for teeth or is it bad in the long run?
4378,best text editor,"Is it really? Jetbrains stuff does *a lot*. I don't use vs code, but virtually every day I use phpstorm I seem to find a new feature that's useful.

Refactors, integration with servers, integrations with DBs, running static analysis tools on the fly, nice navigation (click into a function etc.). 

It's hard to imagine a free thing doing as much as jetbrains seems to do. 

Can anyone comment, are they actually comparable?"
36891,best roller coaster at six flags,the reason sfa transitions so harshly is that everything in front of wild one was built over decades while the area behind it was planned and built in a few years. Until 1999 Wild One was effectively the very back of the park
32682,best vacation resort,"Yes, like I said Sandpiper Bay is the only all inclusive in the US. if you are looking mainly at all-inclusive resorts in the hopes of saving some cash then I might recommend a vacation home. With a full kitchen you can save considerable on meals over what you would spend at a hotel. 

Other than that, as I said there aren‚Äôt any true all-inclusive resorts in the US that are beachfront."

73321,best Linux distro,"What about:

\-Fedora

\-Zorin OS

I highly recommend Fedora, It uses the Gnome DE and it is very reliable and easy to install and use and it has a great community, and for Zorin OS it's very suited for those who are coming from windows or mac its DE is very clean in my op and user friendly, You won't go wrong with choosing any of them."
