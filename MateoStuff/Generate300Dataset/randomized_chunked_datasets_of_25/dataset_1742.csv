50651,"Non hip-hop albums 

John Carpenter - Lost Themes 3

Spirit of the Beehive - Entertainment, Death (This one has really grown on me Philly indie DIY rock, shoegaze, electronic group. Best album cover as well.)

Floating Points, Pharoh Sanders - Promises (Slow building jazz record with an orchestra)

Olivia Rodrigo - Sour (Really enjoyed her songwriting on this ngl)



Hip Hop 

Madlib - Sound Ancestors (Maybe AOTY I love Madlib)

Playboi Carti - Whole Lotta Red (Fuck you the majority of my time listening to this has been in 2021)

Mike Dean - 4:22 (Crazy synth work with only a few tracks with drums. Still super cool sounds highly reccomend. Any time he puts synths on top of that long guitar ""shoegazey"" reverb in songs I want to cum) 

J Cole - The Offseason (Find my self going back to this still so I must enjoy it. Not a lot of ""playlist songs"" tho.) 



Need to start looking at more recent stuff instead of diving into my old shit as much it seems. Recently been listening to the Lil Baby/Durk album and I think its decent as well. Really looking forward to the new Baby Keem album as well.",best rap album

27231,"Personally TSLA, GOOGL, ABNB, DIS and AMZN for sure,

Also perhaps MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, TSM, AAPL, AMD, MU, QCOM, SQ, AFRM, PLTR, Panasonic, UUUU, BYD.

Edit: 

Anyone who knows anything about EVs, auto manufacturing, neural networks and disruptive technologies of the past is nuts about TSLA, im not gonna delve into it. If they solve FSD within 5-10 years, their fair-value valuations literally would go nuts even without the other company segments. If Tsla continues to perform as they have been and solve actual FSD, they will be the first 10, 50, 100T market cap company, im sure of it. If they dont, theyre still ahead of everyone and the lead is widening, margins are amazing already today. (some improvements should be made with quality control, consumer support, infastructure in Eu, etc). If something drastic doesn't happen to the outlook of the company's trajectory, Tsla will very likely be the most valuable company by 2030-2035.

BYD is the probable runner up in the 10-15 year future of BEVs (Different margins are gonna mean whole different valuations tho).

MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL Have huge moats, Google is still secretly a growth company, Azure and AWS are great for the other giants.

Google, Disney, Netflix are the holy trinity of streaming. YT will dominate humans' attention market even more in 5-15 yrs time.

Nvidia, Amd are winning with pocket aces and grabbing all the all-in money they just got from others bluffing (mainly Intel).

Mu, Qcom are for supplying the evergrowing singularity we have achieved.

Square and Affirm I like for fintech plays. High risk high reward. Paypal and Adyen for some safer fintech.

For battery space, Panasonic and CATL if it becomes tradable. If You understand energy needs of the future and dangers of climate change, You know it has to be solved with renewable energy, batteries and nuclear.

If youre into solar, check out JinkoSolar, Canadian solar, First solar, Sunpower, Sunrise, SolarEdge, Enphase, Daqo, (Tesla).

Nuclear let-it-sit could just be UUUU, they also have rare-earth metals, which are bound to increase in price.

Palantir is a new market sector you might regret you didnt get into in 2030. Might be nice to have your hand in that pie a lil bit. Airbnb is the same imo, the outlook is very bullish even though it might not show in guidance. Abnb is secretly dispruting many industries at once.

For e-commerce, besides Amzn, I like Shopify, Sea Limited, Mercadolibre, Jumia, Etsy.",best stocks to buy
16853,"I've had a rabbit. You're right, they tend to attach themselves to one or two people and need a lot of socializing to adjust to strangers. They're not really suited for for kids, although a rabbit can work as a family pet with heavy parental supervision. They aren't ""cuddly"" and have an instinctive fear of being lifted off the ground, so they shouldn't be picked up under most circumstances, which can be an issue for kids who want a pet they can hold. They're also destructive, messy, expensive (especially the vet bills), and surprisingly long-lived--10+ years isn't uncommon. A pet rabbit could easily see their daughter into college. Their personalities are a weird combination of sensitive, aloof, inquisitive, and stubborn. It's more like having a fluffy, bouncy roommate than a pet. Think vegan cats.

In short, rabbits make great pets for quiet, introverted, homebody adults that aren't house-proud or hung up on snuggling their pet.",best pet for toddlers

On the other hand, integrated microphones have been improving lately because people expect their voice to sound better nowadays because the audio in their phones have improved, especially as wireless headphones have become ubiquitous so the dinky phone earpiece isn't used as much anymore.",best webcamera

57678,"As others have suggested, La Nuit de L’Homme (by Yves Saint Laurent)

* Great for the cold season
* A main note is cedar (matching your 'woody' preference)

My other suggestion is Guerlain Homme Intense (by Guerlain)

* Perfect for for Fall/Spring
* Has a fresh mojito vibe, has cedar base
* Also works well during the Summer

If you want to switch it up for summer, then I'd suggest L'Eau Bleue d'Issey Pour Homme (by Issey Miyake)

* Bright as a summer day; don't overspray
* Fresh citrus opening, somewhat 'herby', cedar base

If you can swing it, Oud Wood (by Tom Ford) or Grey Vetiver (by Tom Ford)

* Never-go-wrong year-round
* Very clean, very masculine

If you want to buy the hype, Creed Aventus

* Super overhyped
* But is a very good scent, depending on the batch
* Try to buy batch 18B11, other formulations may disappoint

If you can, try on at a mall Sephora. To buy, check out fragrancenet.com (the site frequently has 30% off 'coupons')",best cologne

My wife and I like cooking. When we got married, three people gave us gift cards to Williams-Sonoma. Great. There's stuff there that we wanted, but it was all 30-50% more expensive than from Amazon or something. You've just devalued the money you gave us, and limited our selection.
