2933,"My personal roster for headphones are hd8xx(launching around nov similar to hd800s), k712 pro, k7XX, pc38x and tygr300r. My personal favorite os the pc38x because it just does everything and does it lovely,  is so airy and punchy, yet enough detail and warm to heard it all day but its kindy stiff at the start so I changed pads to brainwavz fenestraied, tygrs are bit less in mid range, k712 is not that punchy and requires good amp (but one of the best all rounder and detailed) and any hd800 is way to expensive for just gaming but still the best death precision imaging i have tried. Pc38x just earned my respects for its price and easy of use. With pc38x/pc37x being so good for gaming I see no reason to look at the 500 series.",best headphones

30539,"After WWII, the US mostly started wars when it felt threatened by the growing power of a particular enemy. There are always strong economic reasons, but if you just look at the general political context, the US has been trying to prevent a strong coalition in the USSR and in the Middle East. If the US let the USSR/China annex Vietnam and Korea, and expand unchecked, by the time the communist governments actually attacked the US directly it would probably be too late. This is the same logic that caused Great Britain to declare war when Germany invaded Poland in WWII. If your enemy is a dictatorship that is continuously accumulating power, you'll probably feel justified in attacking them before they become too powerful to defend against. So the only question about these wars is whether the potential threat was truly great enough. It was pretty much a no-brainer when it came to the invasion of Poland, but may have been more of an educated guess on the part of the US government when it came to Korea and Vietnam.

TL;DR Korean war and Vietnam war may be justified if put into the political and historical context of the Cold War",best Mexican war to study

What're some of the differences between the 70 and 73? Aside from the base, it looks like the 70 has the ""interactive sound led lighting"" and the tilt is a little narrower 2°/17° vs the 3°/20° of the 73. Is that it?",best desktop monitor

Ralph got his medal and returned to discover himself unhappy even though he got what he thought would redeem him, and he throws the medal into the back of the screen, a really cathartic moment. And from there, you see the side of the Sugar Rush game and it leads perfectly into the final part of the movie. I love this movie, if you couldn't tell",best movies with a cool twist
