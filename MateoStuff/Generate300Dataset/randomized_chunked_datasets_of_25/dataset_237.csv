56239,best action and adventure movie,The Princess Bride
54090,best medicine for a cold,"This will get buried but it works. 

Hot food. Nothing kills a cold or sinus infection faster for me than eating very very spicy food."
37084,best amusement park,Actually yeah. It’s about a 4.5 hour flight followed by a 1 hour drive. Expect 6-7 hours total. Not bad at all.
32114,best hotel to live in,"Disney’s Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World in Florida. It’s so fancy and the monorail passes through it (no, it’s not loud). You also get a view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks! There are fun pools and restaurants and gift shops and spas and honestly you could spend a whole day there just exploring!"
57004,best water brand,Peasant.
55483,best action and adventure novel series,"I second this, I absolutely love this series. Great protagonist and a strong sense of adventure as you follow Paks."
3148,best webcamera,It's about the best thing out as far as web cams go. Unless you wanna go camlink.
23530,best car racing video game,"Oh no, just imagine the green car hitting you at 200 km/h in VR!
Saatana!"
57648,best cologne,"Yes, carbon's scent is very similar to Dior Sauvage, but without the harshness from the ambroxan."
11458,best gifts for dad,Damn I didn't think dads gonna require gifts for each of this lol

52305,best hiphop album,"Absolute rubbish. I suspect these polls present a complete biased towards the demographic that uses rateyourmusic, and that's it. Ironically, it think it maps over pretty well for the avg Reddit Hip Hop fan."
50553,best rap album,"ATLiens is def. up there, the production is dope af"
58736,best cologne,":D Thanks! Another tip is: buy your first bottle from the retailer that helped you, because they deserve it for helping you.  
Buy only a small or medium bottle, though. For all subsequent bottles, get the largest size you can from Amazon if they have it. (They carry most designer brands). They are legit, but so much cheaper."
9172,best toothpaste,"I don't like her or her music,  buy it's catchy and was played EVERYWHERE. This is my reasons for knowing the lyrics."
19810,best workout music,Working out to Sabaton? Brutal!
68070,best science fiction novel,"I definitely agree, although based on the quality of the titles and the order I assumed this was just a list rather than a ranking.

I would definitely say A Fire Upon the Deep was far superior in scope, vision, and depth than Ancillary Justice, for instance."
30486,best Mexican war to study,"For a while in school, I really got into the [Great Northern War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_War) of 1700-1721. If you like reading descriptions of battles where Scandinavians face off against Russians along frozen rivers with cool-sounding names, this is the war for you."
16839,best pet for toddlers,Rats make awesome pets. But they don't live very long.
47681,best state to visit in the United States,"**Arkansas**

Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, AR is a must-see.  

Eureka Springs, AR is a very unique town with a spooky haunted hotel.  

Hot Springs, AR for the horse races, Garvan Gardens, and the hot springs.

Floating the Buffalo River has absolutely beautiful scenery."
32509,best vacation resort,"If there's an Intercontinental in Cabo, I recommend it. I've stayed in the one in Puerto Rico and it was AMAZING! Wifi everywhere, the beach was wonderful, lots of little restaurants near by. Old San Juan was just a bus ride away and was absolutely beautiful! I've only heard good things from friends and family staying at Intercontinental Hotel/Resorts in many different countries. When I plan my honeymoon with my fiance, I'm going to try my hardest to stay at one again."
5934,best programming language for web development,Dude. Th. Fucking saved.
47650,best state to visit in the United States,"NJ, I'd say either the boardwalk at night in the summer, or a top notch Italian place somewhere around Essex county."
31998,best hotel to live in,"Thanks for the list.  I agree with most of your choices.  Knights Inn is the worst.  I naively booked one on a business trip and immediately checked out after getting a room with a cracked window, saggy bed, and reeking of patchouli.   The hoopties in the parking lot should have been a clue that I was in a sketchy place.   I drove around in my rental car until I found a decent hotel.  I would have slept in my car if necessary over staying at that Knights Inn.

I’m a fan of Embassy Suites.  I have had many good experiences there."
