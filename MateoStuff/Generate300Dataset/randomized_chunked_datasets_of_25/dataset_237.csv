58736,":D Thanks! Another tip is: buy your first bottle from the retailer that helped you, because they deserve it for helping you.  
Buy only a small or medium bottle, though. For all subsequent bottles, get the largest size you can from Amazon if they have it. (They carry most designer brands). They are legit, but so much cheaper.",best cologne

31998,"Thanks for the list.  I agree with most of your choices.  Knights Inn is the worst.  I naively booked one on a business trip and immediately checked out after getting a room with a cracked window, saggy bed, and reeking of patchouli.   The hoopties in the parking lot should have been a clue that I was in a sketchy place.   I drove around in my rental car until I found a decent hotel.  I would have slept in my car if necessary over staying at that Knights Inn.

I’m a fan of Embassy Suites.  I have had many good experiences there.",best hotel to live in
