11027,best backpack for college,"I got one since I also didn't like the common sport style bags like op. Now I use it for everything, day trips, even groceries and it's pretty durable."
71871,best movies with a cool twist,"The first movie was brilliant. I can remember having a go about how obvious the ending was going to be and then, when that thing happens at the end, I pretty much just shut my damn mouth for a couple of months."
59590,best perfume,"Hmm, it's hard to say. Each of these scents gives me a feeling, and taken together it's a kind of symphony where I get a sense of your vibe. From that it's just a matter of trying to put words to that vibe. 

In general they're refined, thoughtful scents, that give a sense of restraint but also taste. I don't know why but taken together they seem like they would appeal to someone of the above description.

More of a potshot, but are you from New England or Britain?"
40808,best instrument to play,"I agree completely.  Furthermore, play for the love of music, not for anything else.  If I see a girl absorbed in her music when she plays it, it's way more attractive than watching a girl playing music to try and be impressive.

Also, finding joy in music can be as fulfilling, if not moreso, than impressing people or winning people over.  Consider it not only a gift to others but an invaluable gift to yourself.  

Sorry for the rant, I just love music."
67110,best places to skydive in california,"I live in San Diego and learned at Perris.  Perris also has some of the best load organizing especially for newly licensed people.  A lot of san diegans drive up to Perris as well for the better jumping.  A lot of people also makes the 2 hour trip from LA to perris.  It's not uncommon then to find people sleeping in cars or vans at the DZ as a result.  

Some people like SD for the smaller dz feel.  I just feel like they prioritize tandems too much ever since it changed ownership.  This is especially true if they are limited to one plane.  There were a few other things that I didn't like as a new jumper when I went there that ended up driving me away.  Once you are licensed, you can go to SD, Perris, Elsinore and Oceanside(once you have a B license).

Perris has a few other perks for students.  The wind tunnel is right there and is part of the first jump course.  Once you finish AFF and your coach jumps they also offer an LO to jump with you so you aren't stuck hucking solos til 25. Elsinore has a lot of ex-Perris instructors so is a second good option.  The only downsides to learning at Perris is if you wait to start in may or the summer.  It can be really frustrating there as a student when the winds hit 14mph and students go on a wind hold.  If you finish your A license before it really warms up then you might hit the wind holds more occasionally."
13148,best gifts for mom,Oh you can't go wrong with Williams Sonoma. Get her a little box of their mulling spices. They smell soooo good on the stove. ☺️ Merry Christmas! I feel like I know you a bit.
3608,best college for research,niche gives lots of student reviews and rankings by major that are somewhat valid
71449,best movies with a cool twist,"Just do what me and my brother did with his girlfriend. She stood by her reasoning of not wanting to watch it (It's just a movie about a bunch of guys fighting, I don't want to watch that) So, we started the movie and paused it right after ""Fight Club"" left the screen during the opening credits. Then we told her we had a movie picked out and we're waiting on her to start it. She fucking loved the movie, but as soon as Brad Pitt said, ""Welcome to Fight Club."" She lost her shit. It was pretty hilarious."

5303,best home improvement store,Wow I used them years ago to get a unique spacer for a custom motorcycle I was building
45381,best gaming system,"Own a PC, switch and PS5. Will get a game on pc if its available otherwise get it on the system its exclusive to. No need for a xbox.

PS games coming to pc is fine, they normally get ported over a couple of years after release or when its sequel is about to release. I'll still end up getting it on PS first."
66069,best college in california,"I’m really not sure I understand why “the system” should require everything you listed for average Californians to be able to afford to send their children to a school funded by their tax dollars? 

Shouldn’t California universities serve Californians?"
9983,best portable charger,"I can recommend the Xiaomi 10400. Really cheap, too. Been using it for a few months now and it's great. But as others said, don't hold your breath for BIFL qualities."
68125,best science fiction novel,Dark Forest is a great pick. Definitely the best in the series. Three Body Problem was also fantastic.
22818,best celebrity,"Tom Hanks and The Rock. I used to live on Edwards AFB in the Mojave Desert of California. During this time, I was witness to several movie and television productions. Tom Hanks was shooting scenes for From the Earth to the Moon which, he was a producer for. The filming for that was happening adjacent to where my mother was working, my brother and I were there (parents couldn't afford a sitter, so her break room and the TV was our sitter). Mr. Hanks came into the building, I guess to use the rest room, my brother and I got to meet him. Very nice, very polite, was very fascinated in the history of the base.

Next, a few short years later, I met the Rock. He had filmed some scenes for The Scorpion King on the fringes of the base where it was a bit rockier and more desolate. As a thank you for using the base and many airmen as extras, the production company showed the movie 2 weeks before it hit theaters. After the film there was a Q&A and autographs. I was wearing my football jersey, my brother and I had come from practice immediately to the movie theater. Having played football, the Rock asked my brother and I about our team, our record, etc. While we had a brief conversation he generally appeared interested in our small little team. 

So yea, Tom Hanks and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson were very nice."
27935,best breakfast foods,"I am quite happy with just plain old buttered toast.

Lord have mercy if the only available butter is unsalted, though."
53583,best medicine for a cold,Convince your employer to give adequate sick time.
51817,best iphone case,"I bought an Apple saddle brown leather case for my iPhone 12 Pro shortly after getting it. I returned it a few weeks later when I realized that the ""leather"" they are using this year is nothing like the leather they've used in the past. The ""saddle brown"" color is literally brown paint. In that final third week, I realized it was never going to actually patina and instead was just going to wear that paint coat off when I noticed one corner wearing through. It looked awful. My previous saddle brown leather cases looked like actual leather and started patina-ing almost immediately, and they looked incredibly cool a few weeks after getting them (and continued to look cool for the two years I used them.) One is still in use with a friend who has that model iPhone and looks great even over four years later. These new ones are incredibly disappointing."
42738,best detective show,Broadchurch is sensational.
3785,best college for research,As a Wisconsinite. I have no idea where it is on this map.
41591,movies like Inception,Actuallly. It’s called I use airplay on iPhone and for some reason it won’t disable subtitles unless it imbedded in the screen. I have no problems with anime but I’ve seen so many movies on here and then go to watch them and can’t because they have subtitles. No else’s fault I suppose besides apple for being fucking lame.
