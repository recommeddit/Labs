59590,"Hmm, it's hard to say. Each of these scents gives me a feeling, and taken together it's a kind of symphony where I get a sense of your vibe. From that it's just a matter of trying to put words to that vibe. 

In general they're refined, thoughtful scents, that give a sense of restraint but also taste. I don't know why but taken together they seem like they would appeal to someone of the above description.

More of a potshot, but are you from New England or Britain?",best perfume
40808,"I agree completely.  Furthermore, play for the love of music, not for anything else.  If I see a girl absorbed in her music when she plays it, it's way more attractive than watching a girl playing music to try and be impressive.

Also, finding joy in music can be as fulfilling, if not moreso, than impressing people or winning people over.  Consider it not only a gift to others but an invaluable gift to yourself.  

Sorry for the rant, I just love music.",best instrument to play
67110,"I live in San Diego and learned at Perris.  Perris also has some of the best load organizing especially for newly licensed people.  A lot of san diegans drive up to Perris as well for the better jumping.  A lot of people also makes the 2 hour trip from LA to perris.  It's not uncommon then to find people sleeping in cars or vans at the DZ as a result.  

Some people like SD for the smaller dz feel.  I just feel like they prioritize tandems too much ever since it changed ownership.  This is especially true if they are limited to one plane.  There were a few other things that I didn't like as a new jumper when I went there that ended up driving me away.  Once you are licensed, you can go to SD, Perris, Elsinore and Oceanside(once you have a B license).

Perris has a few other perks for students.  The wind tunnel is right there and is part of the first jump course.  Once you finish AFF and your coach jumps they also offer an LO to jump with you so you aren't stuck hucking solos til 25. Elsinore has a lot of ex-Perris instructors so is a second good option.  The only downsides to learning at Perris is if you wait to start in may or the summer.  It can be really frustrating there as a student when the winds hit 14mph and students go on a wind hold.  If you finish your A license before it really warms up then you might hit the wind holds more occasionally.",best places to skydive in california

71449,"Just do what me and my brother did with his girlfriend. She stood by her reasoning of not wanting to watch it (It's just a movie about a bunch of guys fighting, I don't want to watch that) So, we started the movie and paused it right after ""Fight Club"" left the screen during the opening credits. Then we told her we had a movie picked out and we're waiting on her to start it. She fucking loved the movie, but as soon as Brad Pitt said, ""Welcome to Fight Club."" She lost her shit. It was pretty hilarious.",best movies with a cool twist

22818,"Tom Hanks and The Rock. I used to live on Edwards AFB in the Mojave Desert of California. During this time, I was witness to several movie and television productions. Tom Hanks was shooting scenes for From the Earth to the Moon which, he was a producer for. The filming for that was happening adjacent to where my mother was working, my brother and I were there (parents couldn't afford a sitter, so her break room and the TV was our sitter). Mr. Hanks came into the building, I guess to use the rest room, my brother and I got to meet him. Very nice, very polite, was very fascinated in the history of the base.

Next, a few short years later, I met the Rock. He had filmed some scenes for The Scorpion King on the fringes of the base where it was a bit rockier and more desolate. As a thank you for using the base and many airmen as extras, the production company showed the movie 2 weeks before it hit theaters. After the film there was a Q&A and autographs. I was wearing my football jersey, my brother and I had come from practice immediately to the movie theater. Having played football, the Rock asked my brother and I about our team, our record, etc. While we had a brief conversation he generally appeared interested in our small little team. 

So yea, Tom Hanks and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson were very nice.",best celebrity

51817,"I bought an Apple saddle brown leather case for my iPhone 12 Pro shortly after getting it. I returned it a few weeks later when I realized that the ""leather"" they are using this year is nothing like the leather they've used in the past. The ""saddle brown"" color is literally brown paint. In that final third week, I realized it was never going to actually patina and instead was just going to wear that paint coat off when I noticed one corner wearing through. It looked awful. My previous saddle brown leather cases looked like actual leather and started patina-ing almost immediately, and they looked incredibly cool a few weeks after getting them (and continued to look cool for the two years I used them.) One is still in use with a friend who has that model iPhone and looks great even over four years later. These new ones are incredibly disappointing.",best iphone case
