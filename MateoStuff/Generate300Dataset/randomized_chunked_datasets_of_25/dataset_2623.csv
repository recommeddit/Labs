48074,best color to paint with,"Dude, stop spamming that article. Color theory has absolutely nothing to do with moods and stimulation, it's just about color perception."
41822,movies like Inception,"+1 for Moon, The Thirteenth Floor and Ex Machina. Those will seriously get you thinking.

As much as I enjoyed the eye candy in Ex Machina, I wish they hadn't sexualised it as much because a lot of people just either love or hate that part, focus on that and miss the main message.

Adding one to the list:

* Source Code

Not as mind blowing / applicable as the others, but none the less very interesting."

24987,best spiderman actor,"My opinion:

1. Toby did a good job doing the nerdy Peter Parker, but a bit too passive as Spider-Man. Also Sam Reimi.

2. Andrew did a good portrayal of Spider-Man, but his Peter was too douchey, and unfortunately in mediocre movies.

3. Tom's is a good balance of both."

10530,best suitcase lock,I was going to add that. I've heard of using flare guns or starter pistols.
8749,best toothpaste,"You're the first person to recommend Sensodyne for the average person, regardless of whether or not they experience tooth sensitivity. Most of the comments have said to use it IF you're sensitive, but I don't understand why you would wait to become sensitive before switching to it.... why not just use it all the time to avoid becoming sensitive in the first place??"

16770,best pet for toddlers,"Well, blocking would be a best primary strategy, but if a kid puts their hands on your dog after you've told them not to, you can remove those hands gently without much risk of being accused of anything. You'd do the same if they stuck their hands into your backpack."

43397,best ad service for mobile applications,"For quite a long time my country wasn't supported as well. I was offering in-app purchases via 3rd party e-commerce provider. Google did not complain about it. I kept this option even when Google Play Billing became available for developers from my country. Actually, I am still using it as the deadline for switching to Google Play Billing is September 30, 2021."
19127,best YouTube video,LetsGameItOut is also similar to Grey
41405,best instrument to play,"I think you picked a strange way to interpret it.
