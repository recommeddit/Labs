44421,best items under $100,"I think it depends on what sort of exercise routine you are going for. I'm a former ballet dancer, so for me I use my kitchen counter as a barre and just need weights/pilates/yoga/running to add some variety and make my workouts more balanced. For people interested in the types of programs most often discussed on Fittit, pullup bars and heavier weights are a must - that's just not my type of exercise.

I think the most important thing is we agree that you can get a lot of good exercise equipment for under $100 so saying a gym membership is too expensive is no excuse. And it's definitely a worthwhile investment! :)"

6870,best iPhone,"Depends on what characteristics are important to you. If screen size is important, then you're looking at a standard iPhone 11 or 12, or one of the Pro Max sizes. If premium 4k video options, a premium camera, Dolby Vision, Apple's new ProRaw format, or very fast processing speed are all important to you, then you'll want to consider the Pro line. Though I have to admit the standard 11 and 12 are still very good in all categories.

Our whole fam has recently upgraded to iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Everyone seems very happy with their phone. I came from an old Google Pixel to the 12 Pro Max after being with Android for 10+ years.

Of course, there are some things I miss about Android, but the transition was pretty easy and I'm still glad I did 2 months later!"
