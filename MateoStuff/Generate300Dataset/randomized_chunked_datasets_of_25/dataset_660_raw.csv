"would you recommend to stay away from all LG fridges? or are there some that are ""ok"" . 
Totally agree with avoiding Samsung fridges though"
"Boy, you're not wrong. Ran into a perfect example earlier today on reddit."
"I love my PaperLike, and their customer service is top quality.  I fucked up installing both of the ones they sent me, emailed them and they sent two more out for free.  They also sent me an email with different ways of installing them to make it easier/dust free."
The full sized candy bar. For most it was only a myth.....but for some it was like finding the pot at the end of the rainbow.
"God, I love how nonchalantly you brought up the vomiting here. 

Also, I dropped off on the Steins;Gate rewatch around episode 16, but I'm glad to hear you enjoyed the series as much as you did. I had a feeling you might considering your opinion of Madoka."
"* The Audible DRM was broken years ago.

Only one of Dalvin's clips was against us? Even after he ran for like 3000 yards in one game? Woohoo!
"It's extremely underrated.  The story, the gameplay, the rpg elements, this game deserves way more attention."
Billionaires.
"A manual brush *can* be just as good as a powered brush, but the technique is hard to master for many people. Powered brushes are better because they eliminate a lot of the technique required to do a good job brushing."
"I bought an [OtterBox Strada](https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/iphone-12-pro-max/77-65468.html).

It's fucking garbage. Stay far away from it. Cannot recommend this case for anyone.

Leather feels super cheap. The volume buttons are super difficult to press. The force required is absurd. The plastic has clear, sharp molding lines that makes it uncomfortable to hold. The leather edge is so sharp that my pinky hurts after 10 minutes of holding my phone one-handed."
Itâ€™s legit.
"That's amazing. When growing up, you think those trivial drawings done as a kid are just silly, who would think that they'd be meaningful. This really made me think. Very sorry for the loss of your father."
Shout out to Silverwood for being the only available park within a reasonable driving distance for 3 states. Boulder Beach is actually a pretty damn great waterpark
"Yeah, it ends in disillusion and tragedy, so it doesn't have that upbeat connotation that I certainly have with the term ""adventure"". It IS an adventure in the sense that it explores what was (for most of its audience at the time) an unseen corner of the world, but than, it was the age of Cinerama, and the film is almost a semi-travelogue.

As for action, I disagree with Lean that action somehow ""cheapens"" a movie. But I do still like the movie a lot, so. Bridge on the River Kwai is probably closer to being an action film."

One thing to consider is checking out Best Buy as well.  I got a nice kitchen aide dishwarsher there on a Black Friday.  They matched HD's Black Friday price AND had a free delivery and installation deal of their own going on.  It ended up being nearly half regular price of everything.
I aspire to become a dad like yours
"I myself am beginner as well with knowledge in HTML/CSS at the intermediate level and starting to learn JavaScript and been learning Python. Reddit for example is written in Python on the back end I believe , Facebook in PHP. All just depends really on what you're trying to build."
Probably the difference between having kids who live at home and kids who are out of the house already.
The Room series for me has been my go to game to play. Disappointed that VR version won't have a mobile version. Can anyone recommend me some good portrait mode games. Tried grindstone but didn't like it too much.
Absolutely. Most places require you have internet access to even apply for a job.
"Columbo.  It's an older show, but it *absolutely* holds up.  Each episode is 90min and completely standalone - really more like a made-for-tv movie."
