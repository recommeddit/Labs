Ready to die - biggie smalls
"I've visited a couple countries, but honestly I'd still rather live in the US. The reason being that if I want to approximate the stuff I like about other countries, I can in the US. Mostly small stuff like food. But I can't transpose the things I like about the US to other countries. Like guns, classic cars, wide open spaces, relatively freer society and that other stereotypically American bullshit that I actually really like."

"Next time you do it, try ""fat-washing"" the whiskey.  It'll impart the bacon flavor but remove the unappealing greasiness of the residual fat.

In a mixing bowl or large jar, mix a cup of liquid bacon fat in a liter of whiskey.  Stir, cover, and let it sit at room temperature for at least 6 hours, but not more than 3 days; try making a couple batches to see how strong you like the flavor.  Put the covered vessel in the freezer.  The fat will solidify and you'll be able skim it.  Finally, strain it through a washed paper coffee filter.  ""Washed"" means rinse the paper with clean boiling water to avoid the paper flavor.

It's not a spur-of-the-moment thing, but you can make as much of it as you want, and it'll keep practically forever, so make a big batch and enjoy at your leisure."
"Switzerland: Müesli is very popular.

It was invented here, after all."

It's one of my treasures.
"Yeah, dude. She was into you.   Probably wanted you to smell like someone else she had great memories of and wanted to make some with you."
Go to Rusty's or the two on the Mesa (I forget their names)

"Santos is way too low, how are them behind Celtic and Benfica lol"
"There is no such thing as ""the best distro"". There may be good or bad choices for a certain use case but since use cases and personal preferences can vary widely, the ideal distro is different depending on the person and what they want to do.

Example: I use Void, Linux Mint, Debian and Ubuntu Server. None of them are better than the other ones imo (okay, Ubuntu is worse but I have no favorite among the others).
- Void on my laptops because they have limited resources.
- Mint on my main PC and most other devices I happen to use because it has a nice user experience ootb so I don’t have to spend time on setting up everything.
- Debian and Ubuntu Server on my servers (switching away from Ubuntu soon)."
"The horrible people that attend lowly state schools don’t obtain the resources or connections to spread their awful and self-interested ideas. Besides, schools like Harvard overwhelmingly cater to the richest and most powerful of our country, it’s not like it’s a representative sample of our population. And it’s no surprise when children of multi-millionaires make careers out of keeping and expanding their wealth at the expense of so many others."
"Caudabe Sheath.  Slimmest case that actually offers 6.6' drop protection.  Very slim and very grippy, without sticking in your pocket like silicone.  I tried a bunch of cases, and this and the Slik Kung-fu Grip are the only two I kept.  I use the Slik at my dirty shop because it's even grippier and has a bit more protection."
"Yeah, that tends to be a common them among heavy and complex composition. I personally love it as well, but the olfactory fatigue is real with these."
"Chicago, man. Great walking city. Great food - real deep dish, Italian beefs, pierogis, pork chop sandwiches, Chicago dogs...   And I'm not a sports guy, but you have da Bears! And the Blackhawks, even."
"Better than suggesting Arch, btw."
"I used to love the hell out of the Tobey spiderman movies when i was younger. But i gotta admit, they were some trash in reality but did open me up to Spiderman. This new one is the most accurate ver of Spiderman ever"

Oh? That surprises me. What do you find comfortable instead? Asking purely for me cause maybe I'm uncomfortable and I don't know it.
Agreed. See comment elsewhere in thread where I revise my opinion based on data.
BB and DS are all technically RPGs
"I've seen curtains with magnets embbeded at the bottom, so if your bath is magnetic, it'll actually do the same thing."
"> it felt like a prologue to the actual story

That's basically what it is. The manga really, *really* opens up, and the story hits its stride not a couple chapters after where the anime leaves off."
tried them all but I'll always stick with MX
