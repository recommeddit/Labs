About $50 and they're combination hearing protection and Bluetooth headphones so you can actually hear your music  without destroying your eardrums.

They're a good gift too for anyone you know with a lawn or wood shop or something.

At my old house it was a 4-5 hour ordeal to mow and trim the property. I'd likely have went fully insane without those.",best items under $100

6929,"Off the top of my head, I recall The Verge being particularly harsh on the camera. Nilay Patel was underwhelmed by it. Even though his review was okay, he had some fairly harsh words to say on podcasts and in interviews.

The general impression I got at the time from tech reviews was that the X’s camera was very good and well-rounded, but disappointing in that the iPhone lost the crown of best camera to the Pixel. And then the XS tried to regain that crown by pushing to offer better low light performance, but then it sacrificed other aspects in the process, like color and vibrancy. So the XS camera was less well-rounded than the X camera was.

That’s the subjective impression I got from reading several reviews in 2017 and 2018. The Verge was one of them, but there were several others with similar views (off hand, I don’t remember which).",best iPhone

60795,"My favorite is Mike Birbiglia. He has three, and they're all good, but my favorite is the middle one, My Girlfriend's Boyfriend. It is hard to explain, but his show is more than an average stand up act. In fact, Mike has a one man show opening on Broadway this month. He's special.

Ali Wong's are also great, especially Baby Cobra. It's very dirty though, so probably dont watch with Grandma.

If Grandma won't leave, show Ryan Hamilton. He's a real sleeper, I've never met anyone who has seen his show, but his one Netflix show is really hilarious, and totally clean.

Also Chapelle, Burr, Mullaney, Jim Jeffries, Dmitri Martin, Kevin Hart. Also the new Adam Sandberg is great.",Best comedy show on Netflix
5672,"If you **really** learn HTML and CSS, you'll have job prospects. They're ""easy"" languages, so they get glossed over by many devs, but there's a chronic shortage of real front-end devs in the market. Most ""front-end devs"" are just people who've learned a few hot JS frameworks; that's not actually front-end, though. 

Getting the nuance of HTML/CSS takes time and a good eye (experience). Learn vanilla JS, too, because knowing that means you already know most of how each flashy new JS framework functions before you start. 

With vanilla JS, you're also semi-functional in Node.js by default. 

So I'd say HTML/CSS to start — those alone can land you a job. 

Then JS. Solid JS skills make you a full-stack developer. 

PHP is useful, but you can do everything PHP does with JS now. So learn it, but not first. Check job trends for PHP vs Node/JS for a strong argument as to why. 

Databases are worth learning as well, but start on the front end. Back-end devs are many, and the skill level is generally higher (take that with a HUGE grain of salt, because there are a lot of low-quality devs of all shapes and sizes and flavors out there).

Good luck!",best programming language for web development

33237,"Any range estimates you saw are not accurate, if you think they are that far off you'll likely get disappointed later on :)

The EPA ranges are 230, and 300, respectively. If they were higher (400+), they would have lead with that.  EVs are very sensitive to drive styles and weather -- so range can vary a lot from people to person and what the previous drive was like.

But, I would personally run with expecting ~190, ~250  range @ freeway speeds (~70MPH, worse if you're going faster). The EPA range is a mix of City/Freeway (45%,55%).

If you're only city driving, in mild temperatures, you can see higher ranges but that's not really where people care about range. 

If you take an more optimistic view-point and you carry over the Mach-E as an example, you may see the following:

EPA @ 300, Highway Range @ 315

EPA @ 230, Highway range @ 240

But, I probably wouldn't carry that over as it's kind of the exception to the rule. Plus, the Size of an F150 is going to really drag down range @ speed. But, if those do pan out, it would be a happy surprise and really make the truck that much better.",best electric car
