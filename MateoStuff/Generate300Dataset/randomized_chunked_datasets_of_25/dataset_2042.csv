66414,"Because they perform amazingly in qualifiers. I don't think that should be enough to be first, at least winning a continental title in the last 4 years should be, but that's not how the ranking works. In any case, the ranking is a bit stupid, true number one is the world champ and that's it. Belgian supporters would rather be 20th and win a title than stay at the first rank for the next 10 years but without any trophy",best soccer team in the world
47277,">LA is not a fun city to visit. It is so spread out, you spend most of your time driving which is not fun on a holiday.

That's not really true anymore. Most of the touristy parts of LA (Santa Monica, Venice, Hollywood, Downtown) are accessible by the train and bike shares.",best state to visit in the United States

Make an appointment for a haircut/color, maybe call up a girlfriend of hers and make reservations for them to have lunch, or just hand her the cash and send her out the door.

48499,"This is precisely what I'm doing, and I'm in the middle of it now.  We've settled on some off-white grey/beige-ish colors for the main walls with a few accent walls that are just a shade or two darker in the same general tone.  We tried to get creative when we first moved into the house and had some serious misses with colors that were way too bold and loud (despite not looking so on the swatches).  So maybe we're a little gun-shy, but we're playing it safe with softer tones and let our artwork be the accent colors.  Easier to not go bold enough and spice it up than it is to overdo it and try to reel it back.

One note, make sure to prime everything before throwing color on the walls.  IF there's already paint on the walls the color will be completely off.  Both in the actual color of the paint and how it looks from the colored light reflecting off it.",best color to paint with

33860,"I'm a big fan of Crystal Version. It just re-released a couple of days ago on the Virtual Console. I also love yellow version, it's from the first generation of games and has taken a lot of inspiration from the anime(you start with Pikachu instead of picking a starter, you get the other starters throughout your journey, Jessie and James from the anime show up). It, along with Crystal and the other Gen 1 games (Red and Blue) and Gen 2 (Gold and Silver) can be played on the 3DS and the Pokemon you catch can be sent to your Moon version. 

I like those games for nostalgia purposes, but if you were to ask me which games have the objectively best stories I would say Black and White and their sequels Black 2 and White 2. These games have a much more mature story than the other games and touches pretty heavily on the ethics of the Pokemon World.",best Pokemon game
