"Your price point is incredibly low if you are truly wanting the ""Best All-Inclusive Resorts in Cancun"". I'd guess $1200 - $1500 would be more reasonable for the best. I'd head over to [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and try their filters to narrow down the options with the amenities you want, then sort by price."
Menards!
Is the new OSX giving crackers problems? I’ve noticed so many releases lately for windows only... the new guitar rig and amplitube in particular. Curious if anyone knows what’s going on. Lack of demand? Ableton 11 was pretty quick...
"I buy osmosis water from Whole Foods. Pretty darn good. Not as good as the spring water near my families wv campsite. We would buy jugs of that stuff.

Deer Park is the worst water I've ever tasted."
"I like your analogy, but nah it's nothing like that. Its simply that the work bacteria do to drill into your enamel takes time. Like, a lot of time. Its enzymatic and chemical reactions that break down the enamel, and if you're wiping these biofilms (bacterial masses, AKA. tartar) off your teeth each day, you're doing 95% of what's needed to avoid cavities, as the bacteria simply don't have the time to ""set up shop"", as it were. 

The spaces IN BETWEEN your teeth, however... well they simply don't get reached by a toothbrush. So, if you're only brushing your teeth, you're leaving all the bacteria between them there to just work away. They can set up shop, get to work, and destroy your enamel a little bit each second, minute after minute, hour after hour, day after day, because you're never removing them.

It's like if police only ever patrolled major roads. Would that eliminate all crime? Of course not, the criminals would simply move to and harass the areas that AREN'T being patrolled.

This is why most cavities start between the teeth -- that's just where the bacteria are the most protected, and can do their work undisturbed."

That's exactly what Bose is. Bose became popular because they're cheap enough and good enough for most people but not once have they ever been considered a worthwhile brand by anyone that enjoys audio as a hobby.

"In the mouth of madness is a must for mindfuck/twisty stories. If you are familiar with Lovecraft, it's also the best Lovecraft inspired movie (imho)"
That's a cool idea! I'm not sure if it's the type of channel you wanted but I bet you could incorporate chem into your videos so you can do both? There's a lot of people who find chem and sciences interesting on youtube. I bet it'd be a really fun experience since it sounds like you love both!
"What's wrong with gvim on Vista? I use it every day just fine. It seems to slow down a bit on really large log files, but probably not moreso than any other editor."

Ames got a Menards last year and I haven’t been in Lowe’s since.

"Honestly? I hadn’t upgraded in awhile and I’d never had a “top of the line” iPhone. However, my largest “excitements” were the larger battery/better battery life (this has been huge) as well as the improvements to the camera(s). The wideangle is more exciting that the telephoto, honestly. Just wish it had RAW support."
The Belgariad series by David Eddings.  It's a five book fantasy series.
"The Ambassador. It's terrifying what you can do with a diplomatic passport.

"Purdue has an excellent engineering, CS, science, and math program. It's a world class STEM university.

Don't judge a school by it's acceptance rate. Then we'd consider SDSU better than UCSD which isn't true. Purdue has a small in state population, so a high acceptance rate. Purdue is a world class university.

I don't consider Northeastern as good of a school as Purdue since Purdue is a STEM powerhouse."
