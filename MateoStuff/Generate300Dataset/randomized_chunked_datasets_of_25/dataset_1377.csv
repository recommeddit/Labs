65177,"As far as coverage it is area dependent. From my own experience in a city they typically work with lower signal pockets for each in different places. The moment you get outside a city T-Mobile and Sprint in my area can be very spotty. I have seen places where Verizon is the only one that works and other places where AT&T was the only one. I live in the city and I just use a AT&T MVNO and my wife has a Verizon MVNO.

From my own experience in my area Verizon > AT&T > T-Mobile > Sprint",best phone service company
41080,"I would definitely say guitar. I’m a drummer and have gone down multiple paths with different instruments. Uke or mandolin are a bit easier initially, but I got bored with them much faster. Guitar will be a more rewarding long term relationship and is really easy to learn the basics since it’s mostly muscle memory and finger strength. Teach yourself the G C E Am D and F chords and practice changing between them until your fingers hurt too bad to continue 3-4 days in a row. Then you’ll basically be able to play a few songs. And can worry about learning scales and more complex chords later.",best instrument to play

67111,"The journey to get my A license took 4 years at 4 dropzones across 2 countries. I haven't  jumped in San Diego yet, but I've been meaning to since my friend lives down there.  I have jumped at skydive West coast in banning, Perris and Elsinore and Skydive Mexico (Paracadisimo Tequesquitengo) My personal experience, and it's just my experience, The place I felt safest  was Elsinore. Thats absolutely nothing against Perris, Perris is a top-notch facility and I will say that Perris treated me a bit more like an adult than anywhere else.  I didn't go to Perris till the very tail end of the process where I was just doing the last couple solos so I'm sure the experience may have been different if I would have been there from the beginning. But at Perris I was given a lot freedom and I was basically coming up with my own dive flow then I would brief the coach/instructor he would approve it and then go jump. At Elsinore however, every time I went I was told exactly what was expected of me, what we were going to do, and the dye flow was dictated to me and we went over it and over it and over it and over it. So it was a lot more regimented but made me feel more secure. Maybe it's just because I was at the military for so long that I need that discipline but that's how the experience was for me. Mexico was a very professional place to jump at they were really good actually the the person i worked with was Canadian So even though I'm fluent in Spanish we did everything in English. rigger who rigged for me and me only, So as soon as I come down I would lay down my rig he would start packing it I'd get something to drink he'd bring it to me and I'd be right back on the plane.  I got to jump with a few different people but I worked with only one coach/instructor. There's another American down there while I was there we ended up hanging out and every morning we had the whole drop zone to ourselves and this is a heavy wind tunnel as well, we ended up doing about 20 minutes each of one-on-one time with their wind tunnel Jedi master, and we would go over everything that we had planned for the day.  I mean we even had our own driver that would take us to the place we were staying at or anywhere else that we wanted to go.  I mean the dropzone started checking on me before I was wheels up at LAX. They coordinated my transportation from Mexico City to the DZ which is about an hour and a half away. and they called me when I got home  to make sure I made it home all right, and their corporate office called me the next day asking me if everything went smooth if I had any complaints and how I liked my experience. I'm now friends with some of those dudes down there on Facebook and can't wait to get back down there.  I mean they really looked out for me. 
As for your other part about being around cool people I can honestly say that at Elsinore it feels more family like. I'm totally new and there's people at Elsinore that from day one have just been extremely cool and I have actually made friends there. Even when I took a two-year break, when i came back they remembered me.  I mean it it feels more friendly .  And I really want to stress that I've never had any bad experience at Perris, though my 1 and only cutaway was there it wasn't bad, I mean I was literally there last week.  But I don't know if it's just because they're such a huge operation but it just feels more business like.  2 weeks ago I was at Elsinore and I was on the same plane with the Navy LeapFrogs, while waiting for my load to go up, I met all kinds of people there in the packing area. And even though I was the noob everyone just wanted to conversate find out more about me I mean it's like they were genuinely interested in who I was and how I like the sport so far. We ended up chopping it up drink some beers on Friday night.  At Perris I think I've spoken to three - four people, and all of those conversations were transactional related. Finally, I make it a point to not say anything bad about any business or any person so all I'm going to say is don't go to skydive West coast for your license, they are extremely tandem focused . That's about as detailed as I can get without breaking my rule.",best places to skydive in california

35588,"While there are a million amazing beers out there, to say nothing of the various spirits... if we are talking cocktails and the like I would have to say the vodka, lemon lime bitters.

* Shot of vodka,

* 2 squirts of lemon juice,

* 1 squirt of lime, (squirts can be whatever size tastes good, but generally a 2:1 ratio of lemon to lime works best for me).

* A couple of dashes of [Angostura bitters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angostura_bitters) over an ice cube or two.

* Lemon squash to fill; using Australian terminology, this is not like Sprite or 7up, but more like a lemonade in the vein of [Solo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_%28Australian_soft_drink%29), which is apparently like Rondo in the US (if in doubt, aim for a cloudy, carbonated lemonade that tastes like they used real juice).

I fail to see what was ambiguous in;

>There have been recent studies that show that willpower is not depleted, in fact it's the opposite. People who practice willpower are able to do it more and more. 
 
If anything that's more information than the comment you claim is 'clarifying', which only says;

>I'm saying that's what the recent studies suggest.
