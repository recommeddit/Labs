71575,"Murder on the Orient Express

Kind of a movie because I watched the TV movie before I read the novel but I'm one of those guys that has to solve cases and problems so whilst I was watching, I was partly deducing who the murderer was and whatnot. Wrote down some facts and narrowed it down to two people collaborating. Figured I was some genius. When Poirot explained what happened at the end, I was shook because I thought I had it all figured out. Still an amazing read after all this years as the more I read, the more I pick up small clues and facts between the lines. 

P.S. A new movie about this novel is coming out to the big screen soon and it stars like Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, and Dame Judi Dench. Much excite.",best movies with a cool twist

Hrithik Roshan

Ajay Devgn

Akshay Kumar

Aamir Khan

Salman Khan

Unpopular opinion but I don't find Aamir a natural actor. His script choice and the effort he makes elevates his acting big time. Both SRK and Hrithik are good but can ham like hell with bad directors. Ajay's Rohit Shetty collabs really put a dent on what I think about him. He coasts through without any effort. Akshay is Akshay. I feel like I'm always watching Akshay playing himself. Salman, no comments.",best bollywood actor

The whole thing is very extensible.  I have plans to someday enable templates in other spreadsheets, but I haven't have time nor a pressing need for it yet.  The current template does use that table structure, but you can always add columns.  You can also change the template to suit your individual needs.  I tried to keep the example simple enough for people to understand how it works.",best spreadsheet editor
