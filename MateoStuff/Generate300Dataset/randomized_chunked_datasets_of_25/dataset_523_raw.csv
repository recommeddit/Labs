"Does it say that they â€œuse 100% recycled â€œ? Because Nestle, for instance, uses 5% and advertises that itâ€™s made with recycled material."
Can you explain what the advantage is to a new cook? I read [this]( http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-truth-about-cast-iron.html) article about them and all I see is extra maintenance.
I like rolling rock. It doesnâ€™t have a 2 hour aftertaste like that POS hipster beer. I donâ€™t want to taste hops in my bones for a week. Thatâ€™s nasty
"> Even the HoF website lists AP All Pro teams separately, then bunches together SN and PFWA All Pro teams and doesnâ€™t differentiate between the two. That says it all.

That's not true.

[Champ Bailey](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/champ-bailey/)

[Larry Allen](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/larry-allen/)

[Derrick Brooks](https://www.profootballhof.com/players/derrick-brooks/)

In the Career Highlights section, all pro teams are listed out like this (Derrick Brooks' page)

> All-Pro: 1999 (AP, PFWA, SN)  â€¢  2000 (AP, PFWA, SN)  â€¢  2002 (AP, PFWA, SN)  â€¢  2003 (SN)  â€¢  2004 (AP, PFWA)  â€¢  2005 (AP)

> All-Pro Second Team: 1997 (AP)  â€¢  1998 (AP)  â€¢  2001 (AP)

> All-NFC: 1997 (PW)  â€¢  1998 (PW)  â€¢  1999 (PW)  â€¢  2000 (PW)  â€¢  2001 (PW)  â€¢  2002 (PW)  â€¢  2004 (PW)  â€¢  2005 (PW)

And since Brooks is listed as a 6x all pro in his HOF bio despite making on 5 AP first teams, then all 3 count the same."

"It's pretty much the way this sub goes:

- Look at guide

- Think it's kinda cool

- Visit comments

"As much as I'd like to say there is ""the book"" to read (which is probably what you are looking for), there isn't. You should focus on doing analysis and writing code."

"Almost all of the major newspapers get their facts right almost all of the time. It's just that the NYTimes, WSJ and WaPo are all catering to different audiences, and tailor their coverage accordingly. 

NYTimes: General population with a degree from a 4-year college in the US, which is statistically slightly liberal, with a special focus on the NYC area, which is very liberal. 

WaPo: US-college educated population that is professionally involved in politics, especially federal government.

WSJ: US and international college educated businesspeople, especially finance and banking, which tends to skew conservative and corporate. 

For example, look at the story on the Obama administration's proposals for offshore drilling in the next 5 years.

In WaPo, it's ""[Obama administration opens up southern Atlantic coast to offshore drilling â€“ but restricts it in Alaska](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/01/27/obama-administration-opens-up-southern-atlantic-coast-to-offshore-drilling-but-restricts-it-in-alaska/!)""
The article looks at both sides of the issue and the political opposition from left and right. Useful for people in Washington tracking the issue. 

The headline is similar in the NYTimes and the article includes detailed information on the areas being affected and the environmental impacts: [Obamaâ€™s Plan: Allow Drilling in Atlantic, but Limit It in Arctic](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/us/obama-plan-calls-for-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-the-atlantic.html)

In WSJ, the story is ""[Obama Administration Proposes New Offshore Drilling Rules](http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-proposes-new-offshore-drilling-rules-1428952622)""
The article looks at the impact on businesses and investors, but doesn't really care about the effects on the environment.

Same story, but dramatically different headlines and focus. That's why it's important to read multiple sources, especially on the topics that are important to you."
"Get a bidet. More effective, and far cheaper in the long run."

"Thank you so much for your detailed reply. For me the reason I have been looking into UX courses (I actually considered GA but itâ€™s outrageous how much that costs) is because since a very young age (I am 30 now) I am always looking at websites or even just everyday products and think how to improve them and make them more user friendly. I do that even with the documents I draft (I am now a paralegal). So when I came to know about UX I was like ohhhh sweet that sounds like something I would like. I do calligraphy and so I also pay a lot of attention to type face, color combinations and illustration on app interfaces, website or even just greeting cards haha. So yeah... haha I am so encouraged reading about your experience!! Very happy for you too!!"
