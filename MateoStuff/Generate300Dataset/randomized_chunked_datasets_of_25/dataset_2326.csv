44702,"Put one on about a week ago.. why did I wait so long?  Ordered a Luxe from Amazon.  All 4 of us are happy with it, so I'll be ordering for the other two toilets in the house soon.  As you mentioned, and as most reviews I read said, don't bother with the hot water option.

Remember, the ""cold"" water is going to be room temperature water for most of us.  The water in your lines that's been in the house for hours, is not the cold water entering the house.  None of us have complained about temperature yet.

Installation was easy.  I did have to replace a solid line with a flexible hose.  I \*might\* have been able to bend the solid line enough, but the braided steel lines are so much better anyways, so it was worth it to grab one and install it.",best items under $100

70157,"Learning is great and I was super pissed off to see so many people there ""just getting by"". Assholes who stared hate bullets for asking a question and always wanted to leave early. I'm the old guy that was paying for every minute of some smart person's time. 

Now I do something I like, pay the bills and am mostly debt free. 

I'm not passing judgement on anyone, but if you go and spend a lot of money just to ""learn things"", then end up in a field where you can't pay the bills, it's like you invested a shitload of money in a hobby. 

Isn't there free ""extended learning"" type classes or something?

Like someone else said, I think it's finding the balance with something you like that still pays the bills.",best major to study in college
