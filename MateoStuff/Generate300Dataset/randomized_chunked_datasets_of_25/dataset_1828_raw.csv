As someone who hasn't jumped in the Erased hate train I salute you
"Well, I mean that's the way you *don't* get downvoted when doing that so I guess so?"
"While you're right that it is a bit of a solved problem in the $500+ price bracket, there really should be dramatically better options around the $200 price bracket and built into laptops than what we've been seeing.

A 1"" sensor with a decent readout speed and some relatively fast glass that isn't focus locked to infinity (can't believe webcam manufacturers ***still*** don't understand that people generally sit within a few metres of their webcams) isn't *that* much more expensive than a 1/5"" sensor, without even getting into the software issues that most of them have."
"I highly recommend [Chrome Bags](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/).

They make super durable 1000D Cordura (the toughest nylon woven) and has a heavy truck tarp liner suspended independently from the outer shell for additional durability and waterproofing. You can get caught in a heavy downpour and everything inside will stay bone dry in a Chrome bag. All the serious wear points like the straps, etc, are double-stitched so you don't have to worry about anything tearing out.

I've been carrying [mine](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/messenger-bags/metropolis-buckle-bag---large.html) for three years now and it still looks and works great with no sign of wear. There are messengers riding around the city here with bags that are 10+ years old in excellent condition. For your needs, I might suggest considering a pack like the [Pawn](http://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/packs/pawn-rolltop-pack---medium.html), which is big, but not too big, has convenient external pockets, and is made in the USA.

E: I'd also recommend picking up a simple neoprene sleeve to add some padding protection to your MacBook.

For around $150 you get top-shelf design, high durability, heavy weather resistance, and a fantastic warranty. 

These are serious bags made to last."
"Hands down the best camping, long-term portable charger I've owned.  I purchased this charger for LIB 3 years ago & have taken it on every road trip and camping music festival since!  Fully charge it before your trip. It keeps our phones at full charge for the whole event! (4-6 days).  I'm sure this is contingent on how many people you share it with and how often you need a full charge (we did about 2 a day with 3 people).

Jägermeister either pure or mixed with Red Bull.
Ravensword: Shadowlands is pretty good
"Everything and Nothing by Tokyo Milk Dark

I always thought that vanilla was boring and plain . . . but that's because I had only ever known cheap ice cream. Even spending the extra little bit and getting Haagen Dazs over the bulk stuff is a fair step up in terms of quality.
"Plus, let’s not forget how the Black/White games singlehandedly have one of, if not the very best soundtracks of the entire franchise"
Someone I know produced cocktails with Khloe and he had a similar complaint - she wasn’t the best person to work with.
"Hunters on Amazon Prime!!!!! Al
Pacino plays a badass nazi hunter with a ragtag group of vigilantes seeking revenge on the Holocaust. so fucking badass"
"One would need a higher quality filter to begin removing chemicals and such.

My personal water filter is a [Multipure](http://www.multipure.com/) filter that removes much.  Chlorine etc.  Not floride as that's a much more expensive filter they sell."
This is great information. Thank you! Learned something new about cough suppressants and the cough reflex. Really interesting
The I is pretty good. I will also read the Private Eye and The Economist...
"From my experience with 4 different laptops of different price ranges: avoid Asus' laptops at all costs: in one of them the screen hinges broke after 3 or 4 years, and again after changing them; another had BSODs out of the box and some years later the battery exploded; another one died with no reasons after a year and another one has fan grinding problems since it was new and after replacing the fans the problem came back after a month or two."
Opera GX has a RAM and CPU limiter feature afaik. Maybe that could be interesting to you.
“Say it with me now: Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad”
Don't fret too much. It seems like it was around $99 just a few weeks ago too. The deal may come back again in the near future. :) You can set up deal alerts for that.
">Thanks! I went with the Oreilly book as it's geared more towards data science. Im not going to be 100% reliant on the book, and know I'll be consulting other resources to help myself along as well.

Sorry for the late response, but yes I think financial math would be useful. A majority of jobs in data science are related to the finance, marketing and insurance industries. As a result, understanding financial mathematics could be very useful in the future. 

Simply put, financial math deals with the metrics that are important to the running of a business. As a data scientist, we seek to understand and predict metrics. Understanding financial mathematics will allow you to work with those metrics much better, since you will have a firmer grasp of their nuances."
"Came here to say this, super comfortable, great sound."
I love them.
Aquaman felt like a pure adventure movie though at least.
