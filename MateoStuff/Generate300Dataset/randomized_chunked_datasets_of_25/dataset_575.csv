4837,"In Alberta, Canada, my experience has been in favour of Home Depot. The staff is better trained/more experienced, and more attentive. Although Lowes has the price match +10%, they are very picky about giving it out, and it takes them half an hour to decide each time if they'll honour it. Although, one thing I want has been out of stock for months, and I see it's at Lowes in spades though.",best home improvement store
10942,"Another lover of LLBean. I got mine in 2007 as I started 7th grade and used it through college. I still have it and it still in great condition. Like it looks a little well-loved but hasn't lost any functionality. I have no reason to get rid of it so I use it for trips, the gym, etc. I bought a new backpack for grad school for appearancesake only",best backpack for college

73053,"As far as I'm concerned, Ubuntu or Debian > CentOS > RHEL would be my choices. Mainly because Debian has an enormous package repository.

They are all good choices and quite stable. Ubuntu offers support services, though I've never had to call. This may ease management's fears of being up a creek without a paddle. No software vendor is required to help you unless you have a support agreement, which you **will** pay for in some way. There are many free ways of getting support though (Ex. IRC).",best Linux distro

Later I discovered that jumps can really mess the AI of the cops but it felt more like a cheat/exploit than actually getting better on defeating them. Even got the 1,000,000 rep points trophy, but I would really prefer to race by day.",best car racing video game

32406,"We're on the west coast of Mexico and I think the danger of booking during hurricane season is overstated. Unless you're poor and are saving for a decade to make your trip happen, it's highly unlikely you'll be hit with a hurricane.

Coming to Mexico during the rainy season certainly means you might see some rain but the odds of having a hurricane land are pretty slim.

For anyone who can afford an international trip every year or two, it's not that big of a deal to go to Mexico during hurricane season.",best vacation resort
40305,For the cpu if you want a good cpu for about under $500 usd look at the Ryzen 3900x as for the gpu yes the 5700xt does rival the 2070 super for less rtx cards are nice and powerful but not many games support Ray tracing or DLSS (deep learning super sampling). As of now I think four maybe five games support it. Between the cpu and gpu alone that's under 1k if your total budget is 1k then get a 3600 and 2060 as that will be much cheaper,best midrange CPU

Also Rebecca Mader, she's not as well known but oh my god she was so lovely and pleasant to talk to, I was like the 100th person in line to get her autograph and she was still happy to chat and didn't make me feel rushed, very very nice woman.",best celebrity
31887,"I've rented hotel rooms by the month  a number of times. Usually the monthly rate works out to be 60 to 70 % of the daily rate for 30 days.  Note that many hotels and especially guest houses will charge you separately for electrical usage for a monthly rental.  Also, they may only provide limited room cleaning and linen replacement, if at all. Amenities such as daily bottled water, soap and toilet tissue are usually not included.  Internet access may also be charged as an add-on.  Make sure to nail down those details, especially what the electrical rate per unit is as some places will mark it way up.

If you do make a monthly deal and electricity is separate, ask to see your meter when you take occupancy and write down the reading, even better, take a photo of the dial.  Make sure rules and restrictions are clearly understood.  Can you have a hot water pot? A hotplate? What if a guest wants to stay a few days?

If they ask for a security deposit beyond the agreed upon rent, be very careful.  Make sure you make them explain and you understand the terms of the deposit. Do you get your deposit back when you turn in your key or do they have a one or two week ""processing time?""  Do a walk through of the room with them and take photos of everything in the room, especially any visible damage, scuff marks, stains or scratches on furniture from previous tenants and have them acknowledge it.

There are those  who once they get money in hand, don't like giving it back.  The hotel business has many such people.",best hotel to live in
