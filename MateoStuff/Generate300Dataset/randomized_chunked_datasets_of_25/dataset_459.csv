68540,"I'd like to put forward that The Expanse is the first book that provides a look at the long term effects of living in space without FTL and artificial gravity. It's hard science fiction(aside from the obvious impossibility of the drive they use) in a sense no book of that scale has been before. 

And I'm sorry but I have to disagree about the writing. It's written better than Dune(especially the later books), Neuromancer or any of the other classics that most people would never read because they couldn't get into the books for more than a few pages because the subject matter is hidden behind a need to complicate everything. The writing is one of it's absolute strong points, I don't understand why you disparage it.",best science fiction novel
25830,"One important consideration is that, in order to ensure the WIndies bowling squad was indefatigable. 

Consider the 60-61 Tied Test. Wes Hall bowled the last over. In those days the overs were 8 balls. The last over was the 120th 8 ball over of the day... Hall only bowled 7 balls and the over still took 15 minutes.

Days of 125+ 8 ball overs was the norm.

Clive Lloyd slowed that down. The daily workload for his pace battery was reduced and became a pretty consistent 72 6-ball overs per day. This meant his guys were always fresh. 72 overs is 24 per session. 4 pacemen means only 6 overs per session.

\---

Complaints were being made about how the slow over rates were killing Test Cricket and gave force to the rise of ODIs.

The ICC eventually took action after England, in protest, managed to faff their way to 68 overs in a day - using only 2 bowlers, Edmonds and Emburey. Yep 2 spinners bowled for an entire day's play in a Test without interruption and only got through 68 overs.

Thats when the minimum over restrictions came in. All rounders and part-time bowlers became far more valuable to cover injury and fatigue. Another thing the Aussies had access to during their run was physiotherapy services so guys like McGrath, Warne, Gillespie and Lee could keep going and going too.",best cricket teams of all time
