14646,best romantic novel,"I have two fantasy authors that I want to recommend all the time, Elise Kova and Kayleigh Nicol.

Kova is what not only got me hooked on romance books, but also got me back into reading after a rather long reading slump. There is so much stuff in the *Air Awakens* universe that I like and want to explore more of.

I think Nicol writes some of the best characters out there period, and I really want to know what happens to them. And I really wish the short story *Storm Front* (part of the *Mage-Born Anthology)* was a full-length novel. It's so adorable!"

69904,best major to study in college,"Funny, at my school all the engineering majors hated the CS majors for our lack of homework. While they would have problem sets every week, we had a project due every few weeks. Which meant a lot of time doing nothing, then a few nights locked in the lab to get the code compiled & submitted by 11:59:59"
60290,best freezer brand,"while we don't have a chest freezer, we do have a small stand-alone freezer.

not necessarily in direct answer to your questions, since questions 1 and 2 seem to be pointed at the same answers:  

**Buy it when it's cheap:** yes, it saves us quite a lot of grocery money, because we can buy meats on sale w/o having to have them in the meal plan  Chicken thighs go on sale?  buy an extra package.  BBQ season means pork ribs and brisket are cheap? buy an extra package.

**prepared food:** 

* the freezer has also helped us out in giving us the ability to pre-cook meals and sit on them for a while.  we've had 'successful' days at the grocery stores, which leave us with a grip of food.  We will occasionally spend that night cooking 2 or 3 meals, and then dividing them up into serving sized tupperware and then throw them in the freezer for lunches and whatnot.  
* My wife also makes our own soup stocks (chicken, beef, pork, and seafood), and this wouldn't happen w/o the freezer.  We sit on chicken bones (generally carcasses from whole roasted chickens) in the freezer until we have a lot, then those get boiled down, and the resultant stock gets frozen for later use.

**Lazy Days:**  don't want to cook?  pull a frozen pizza out of the freezer!  man.  this alone has saved us time and money enough to pay for the freezer (we did craigslist it, to provide a sense of scale though).  frozen pizza (and even wings) bought either at cost, or especially when they are on sale, easily comes in in at 1/5 the cost of ordering a pizza from the delivery shack.  

**cost of operating:**  Honestly, I don't know.  Maybe I'll leave a note for the wife and see if we can forensically look through the electric bill for some sense of scale, but I don't think it's crazy high because of the freezer.  I know it's not crazy high at all, and I don't think there's  a lot of influence on it from the freezer alone.  We do keep it in the garage however, and we are in Tejas, so it does run somewhat hard.  (luckily, it's on a shaded, fairly cool, side of the house).

**maintenance:** I'll say this too, is that freezers can be fairly easy to repair and troubleshoot.  I fixed mine when it broke once, and while it took a bit for me to get off my lazy ass to do it, it probably only took a total time of 2 hours to research, dis-assemble, meter-out, order, and re-assemble the broken temp sensor.  for $20.  well worth it.  My point here is that while new is good, and you get the warranty (Shopping by warranty is a *huge* criteria of mine when purchasing appliances, tools, and things that get used heavily.  A 'lifetime Warranty' is often worth the price and the peace of mind), don't be afraid of craigslisting a working one and being prepared to fix it when the time comes.  

Anyhow, that's what I've got.  Good Luck!"

29193,best web hosting service,"Sorry bud, but cheap hosting is never the answer. You admit as much yourself but still go ahead and recommend it - why? I think mods should eliminate all answers that have ‚Äòcheap hosting‚Äô in them as it‚Äôs just causing people to make bad decisions. If you buy cheap from the start, you will invariably be switching plans again soon."
