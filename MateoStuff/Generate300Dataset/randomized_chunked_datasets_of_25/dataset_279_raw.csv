I probably don't need 240hz, but I want it and if I get a 165hz.. I'll probably regret it in the future, lol."
"Bryce Canyon, Grand Canyon, Antelope Canyon and Zion. Although every area had amazing, and I mean fucking amazing sights to see, my favorite part was coming out of my shitty hotel near Zion park with absolutely no wifi, driving a mile out into the desert with no lights whatsoever and looking at the sky. You can literally see the whole milky way, and as someone from New England, it was amazing."

Oh sweet baby Jesus...I have done the same thing. It was like every nerve in every tooth was exposed at the same time. I could not even talk because the air hitting my raw teeth made me want to cry. My dentist told me to rinse with flouride rinse and I got many strange looks from the people in the grocery store when I tore open the flouride seal and started swishing and whimpering in the check-out line.

"PS4. Go back and play some of the other exclusives you may have missed like horizon zero dawn and god of war. They’re very much worth checking out. And as for the Xbox exclusives, just get the Xbox game pass on pc. It’s only $1 right now and $5 per month after that to get Xbox games at launch on pc. Also great for other non-exclusives like the outer worlds"
