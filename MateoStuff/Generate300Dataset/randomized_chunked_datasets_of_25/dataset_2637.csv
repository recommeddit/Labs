23058,best celebrity,"I met Murr from Impractical Jokers just as they were about to start filming a challenge in Union Square. I just shouted out ""Yo Murr!"" And waved. One of the producers tried to shush me and get me to walk away so I didn't ruin anything but Murr waved me over and let me take a quick picture with him before they started. He was super nice and happy to meet a fan"

8798,best toothpaste,What about toothbrush? Is there any better than others? Are the electric ones better?
8841,best toothpaste,"Whiteness and tooth health are not one and the same, mind."
5489,best home improvement store,"Where I live, the big box stores have the market for working people cornered, because everywhere else closes no later than 7 on the weekday, and earlier on the weekend. 

It varies from spot to spot. If you have something better in your area, and you are able to make it there without taking a vacation day, by all means buy from them. Home Depot and Lowes are both awful corporations that I wish I were not forced to support."

9056,best toothpaste,"I never used to floss.  At age 35 or so my gums started receding and my teeth became incredibly sensitive to anything hot or cold, like tap water or coffee.  It took me a good five years of flossing every day to get my gums back in order.

Five years of agony every day because I didn't floss for 20 seconds daily.  Stupid me."
25489,best cricket teams of all time,"Cronje had an equally formidable team or may be an even better team than Smith with deadly Donald/Pollock combo and a whole bunch of all rounders in young Kallis/Klusener/Boje. They were batting down to 10 (Pat Symcox) during those days.

&#x200B;

Also The two dominant teams were Aus and SA with a big gap between rest. pak had formidable lineup with two W's but underperformed. Rest of the teams weren't quite there yet in overseas performance.

&#x200B;

By the time Smith took over India had risen (won 2 tests against Smith's SA in SA - one each in 2 series). India had second best overseas record next to Aus in that decade 2003 - 2011. They were on par with SA with Win/Loss ratio of 1.0

SL became better, Pak lost two W's but were still competitive, England stopped being shit since 2005 Ashes turnaround. So there were more competitive teams and the gap was not that big as in Cronje's era."
8900,best toothpaste,"Okay, other people have said baking soda is not abrasive at all. Can someone clear this up?"
41420,best instrument to play,"Personally, I've played it for 5 years now. I was self-tought for the first two years before I got into a music school. I've become pretty decent...
If you do it because you like it, every minute of practise will have impact. If you don't like it, you'll barely have any progress at all!
I suggest, start learning the instrument you'd most like to play, and if it isn't piano, you should learn some piano after playing your chosen instrument for a while. I promise, if you know how to play one instrument, it'll be much easier to learn a second one!
Most music schools I know of will require you to at least have piano lessons, singing lessons and one instrument of your choise, because piano is important for understanding a lot of theory, singing let's you express yourself to other musicians using voice, and a lot of people want to play other instruments as well (like guitar or drums) :)

I'm on my phone rn, so sorry if there's a lot of typos"
54763,best water filter,I have a brita pitcher and the resulting water tastes good.
22198,best celebrity,"Kevin Spacey. 

I went to the cast and crew (really just the crew) premiere of the movie Kpax (my father was a rigging grip). Kevin Spacey ran into the crew theater before the red carpet premiere and gave us all an awesome speech about how he wanted to thank the people that ""do the real fucking work"" (his exact words). He was way cool about it all and after his speech he said he was late for the red carpet premiere and pretty much ran out of the theater to make it in time.

My dad was pretty surprised because he had never seen a star actor do something like that for the crew premiere of a film.

Awesome movie, too."
