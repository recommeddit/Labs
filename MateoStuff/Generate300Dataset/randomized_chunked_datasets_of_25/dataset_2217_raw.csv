BUT OMG CHECK THIS https://www.audiobookx.com/

This site goes free to download very rarely and it just so happens that today it is free.  To download from them, right click and inspect element on a web page then copy the link for whatever book you want and paste it to the page, then download it like that.

but ya, pm later about DC++, DC++ is where you want to go for audiobooks, it's a place called dawghouse where people with terabytes of audiobooks all share with each other.

DC++ is 10x better than audiobookbay...and if you want to pay for audiobookx, i think it's a subscription based thing you can do that...or you can wait till it's free and download everything they have like I do hahaha."

The Night Of (HBO miniseries) is also really good.

And I agree with others who said The Wire, Mindhunter, and Sherlock"
I hope it's an actual bicycle and not a motorcycle. It just seems a lot funnier.
The fact that the home page always has a white background puts me off (I last used Firefox about 6 months ago)

"Yep, it sucks. Especially for peeps like me who are into SFF PCs but they are WAYYY MORE expensive than their US prices. Import is also not an option cus that's freaking expensive. Plus, India has some shit taxes of it's own that hike the price up by upto 25%."

"I've seen people put this more eloquently than I ever will but Montana redefined the position to the one we know today.  

It's not a perfect analogy but would you list the NASA moon landings in the 60s or the recent Tesla roadster  space launch as more impressive?  To me it's still the moon landing, even though NASA in the 60s would never have been able to achieve that precision and retrieval."

"By default, any PDF you get from Archive.org can only be opened using Adobe Digital Editions for a short space of time (1 hour or 14 days, depending on the book). This limitation is called ""Digital Rights Management"" (DRM), because it allegedly protects the rights of (long dead) authors and (fat cat rich) publishers to stop you from reading their books without paying.

If you're on r/Piracy, then you're here to bypass DRM. You should already know what it is.

As for bookmarklets, you know how you can right-click on your bookmarks bar and select ""Create Bookmark""? Instead of putting a website address, you can put a bit of javascript (similar to what I posted above) and save it. Clicking on this special bookmark will run the script on your current webpage."
