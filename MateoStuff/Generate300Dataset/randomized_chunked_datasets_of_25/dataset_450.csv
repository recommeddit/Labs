7057,best iPhone,It must be the time limitation of the oleds turning on once white is detected. Maybe 120hz screens will fix it or most likely MicroLED
39558,best podcast for biologists,"Here's my list of podcasts:

16449,best sunglasses for fashion,"Deleted the comment because Reddit was showing that I had posted it in GD instead of this thread (but I guess not?) but yeah. They have some sick sci-fi inspo there.

Edit: [the first model on this page](https://www.gentlemonster.com/shop/ver1_detail.php?it_id=1572396236&cata=i0) is what we're referring to here if anyone is curious. Forgive my tech ineptitude"
16918,best iOS game,"Minecraft,
Stardew Valley,
Grid Autosport,
Call of Duty Mobile,
Prison Architect."
63025,Best online React course,"Get ""Pure React"" by david ceddia, by far my best source of learning."
62246,Best RPG game on PS4,"It's hook is it's open world, the seas, locations to visit, it's a looter, replayable, shit loads of content, lots of weapons and armour. I mean, I've only played 200 hours of it and it's loved by many so what do I know.

Also, grind = rewards, which is always nice."
30578,best Mexican war to study,"America saw itself as the Arsenal of Democracy. It supplied the Allies but the U.S. government didn't make any money. Allies received up to 90% off tanks, bullets, food, planes, basically free destroyers. FDR tried to help the Allies while not getting Americans killed. Pretty noble if you ask me."
68833,best science fiction novel,If you want to have a super literal interpretation of what is sci-fi and what isn't then go for it dude. Most people are going to ignore you though.
14556,best romantic novel,I put TJ Klune’s The Lightening Heart on my list. Can’t wait to read it!
59775,best perfume,"Subjective, but the two fragrances that I wouldn't debate against even though I don't use them anymore are Dior Homme intense 2011 & Terre D'Hermes EDT"
67156,best places to skydive in california,"He was issued credentials BY THE USPA, not Lodi. That instructor could've died anywhere."

I have the 32”"

71316,best movies with a cool twist,Sarah Snook was so good in this!
2505,best headphones,fair enough. I just didn't want people getting dissuaded from what I see as an excellent pair of headphones.
7797,best laptop for general use,"Where did you hear that the Air overheats? With the new Apple M1 chip, the MacBook Air can run at full tilt for over 8 minutes... you probably won't ever be pushing the laptop that hard anyways.

No, you definitely don't want to get an older Intel model. Compatibility with the Apple M1 chip is starting to improve, and a large handful of programs are already supported. If you're mainly doing browsing, there's really nothing to worry about."
45588,best gaming system,"I mean you also have to take into consideration the cost of living. $15 an hour isn’t shit in NYC while this dude might be balling out there with $15/hr.

If you want perspective you need the whole picture.

Edit: made it more clear so you guys can stop telling me he’s probably not balling on $15/day....no shit."
1553,best ice cream flavor,"Ok, number 1, Portland, OR is completely badass so that's that.

2, Do you have the recipe? I know that alcohol doesn't freeze so a lot of the recipes just say to add it in towards the end - is that what yours says?"
