47247,best state to visit in the United States,"Good I would recommend a pro game.  Tickets can be hard to come by depending on who you want to see and where you want to sit (not really that different than your football).  The season starts at the end of summer and continues all the way through to the Superbowl in early Feb.  The cheapest games to go to would be preseaon games and they happen in late Aug. & early September. 

 However, they are cheap becuase the biggest players/stars don't play the whole game or don't play at all.  They are used to get the players ready for the season and for the coaches to decide on final cuts.  The real season starts after that.  Give me a second and I will find you a link."
22810,best celebrity,"Bruce Campbell. I waited on him three times at a restaurant in Ashland, Oregon. The first time I was nervous as shit so I was very awkward with him. The second time, my coworker and I started drinking Irish coffees on the job and I began talking to him immediately. Convo as follows:

(me taking order, take wife's order first, turn to Bruce): And for you, Bruce?

(this visibly surprise him, stutters his order, his wife chimes in): Now how did you know he was Bruce?

me: I'm kind of a big fan.

(Bruce takes off his glasses, puts out his hand): What's your name, son? I'm Bruce and this is Ida  . . . sweet as apple cida

me: alrida

We continued talking about film school and such. The 3rd time I waited on him he remembered my name and it was awesome. Hail the king!"

30656,best Mexican war to study,"Regardless of who provoked who before the war started, and who was in the wrong. I still view the annexation of what was 1/3 of the Mexican States during that time an objectively unethical and unjust move on the side of the United states. I would understand if they only annexed Texas, but they went the full 100 miles and annexed the entire west coast from Mexico. I know that the west coast wasn't a threat to the U.S. because only around 75,000 Mexicans lived in Mexico's northern territories, so the only other reason I can think of why the U.S. would annex the territory is because of Manifest Destiny and imperialism. I mean the U.S. did the same thing in the Spanish American war, they annexed the philippines, Guam, Cuba, and Puerto Rico from the Spanish Empire. 

Guess in short my question is: Do you think that after the U.S. won the war they were justified in annexing the entire west coast from Mexico?"
33708,best electric car,"Yeah the Bolt is going for a bit of a discount around here now, first time since launch. That's making me optimistic that we can get one for my folks' next car affordably.

54690,best water filter,"According to my experience, pitcher filter don't do much for your water quality (they remove roughly 10% of the contaminants). If you really want to improve your water quality, I suggest looking for an RO system. I personally have very good experiences with the AquaTru waterfilter, which are available in the US and EU. This filter has been thoroughly tested by the NSF, removing up to 99% of all the contaminants in your tapwater, and has been recommended by several experts (among them Dr. Mark Hyman).
I've had the filter since august 2017, and so far, I've got nothing to complain.. The water tastes great, makes me feel good and it's very easy to use.
