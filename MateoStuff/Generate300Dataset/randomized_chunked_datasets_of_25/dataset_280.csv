Little Timmy is going to read articles like these and decide to become a chemical engineer, even though he really dislikes science.  Fast forward 15 years, and Little Timmy is standing over the dead bodies of his wife and 2 children while turning the gun over on himself.  Kids, let this be a lesson to you.

41489,"Mostly because that's all late composers, and community orchestras - or at least the ones I've seen/played in - only very rarely do they play anything later than Dvorak. Generally you're stuck playing the contrabass part at best if you're in an orchestra. 

The one and only thing our orchestra has played out of that entire list is Mussorgsky, night on bald mountain. And I wasn't there for it - it was ten years ago. Though we did play Jupiter a couple of years ago. Yay, orchestra tubas? We just got our director to green light sorcerers apprentice... which has bass clarinet and contrabassoon awesomeness. 

Trombones don't get the best treatment in orchestras either. 

Cello parts are great from Baroque to modern, meanwhile. You're never going to have a bad part.",best instrument to play

As for ethical questions having to do with resorts--yeah they probably aren't the best option for the local economy. In these massively scaled up tourist areas (of which Cancun might be the largest I've seen at least), there are plenty of barriers to entry into the market to keep competitors out that might pay better wages.  If you want to be safer and remain in a tourist area but get out of Cancun, Tulum is a nice alternative.",best vacation resort

112,"Most Unix systems have perl.  The `perl` package has prename (which at least Debian symlinks `rename` to).  That gives you a vastly-more-powerful-than-wildcards feature where you can apply Perl expressions to each filename that you want (and use whatever crazy features your shell has to select the files to operate on).

Eg.

    $ rename s/foo/bar/ *.jpg

will change ""foo"" to ""bar"" in all your .jpg filenames in the current directory.  You could ROT-13 encode, change the case of, modify file extensions, etc on your files.

Also, if you use emacs, and you use emacs's file browser, `dired`, you can use `M-x wdired-change-to-wdired-mode`, which makes your dired buffer editable as a text file.  When you're done, you just hit `C-c C-c`, and the changes to filenames are applied.  Gives you all the functionality of emacs to do renames.",best terminal file manager reddit
