Even if you got a faster car at the start, good luck driving it. Not an easy game, you genuinely feel like you're fighting the car and the road with every bump, bend and turn.

741,"Ugh, someone that finally understands me. Scraping tubs is probably my least favorite thing too, next to interacting with all the people.......
I also hate when an ice cream is particularly hard to scoop and someone orders something that requires like ten scoops. Some of my tears may have gotten into their triple large milkshake.
German Chocolate Cake is currently available in pre-packed quarts! (In my store, at least.)


Just to add, two of my biggest pet peeves are when either 
a) people tap on the glass to get my attention while I'm scooping like I'm an animal in a zoo
b) people ask me questions like, ""What does strawberry taste like?""",best baskin robbins flavor reddit

But, other than that, a properly treated and kept well impossible to beat. Well water has all of the minerals that water should, the only danger is of course if it becomes contaminated.

Also, remember that you are looking at stationary pictures you will only see the tear. When moving in game, it is constantly refreshing the image on screen so the tear isn't in the exact same spot every time. I wouldn't worry too much about adaptive sync and it is still considered a ""luxury"" feature.",best desktop monitor
