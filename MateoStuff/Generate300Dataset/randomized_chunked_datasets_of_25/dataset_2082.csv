31416,best country to live in,Yeah but it doesn't matter because nobody has to sleep in the streets.
35158,best NFL player,No youâ€™re confusing it.
23545,best car racing video game,"Can confirm Dirt Rally 2.0 career mode is like this. Excellent game too, easily my favorite and the most intense racing game I've ever played. Even if you got a faster car at the start, good luck driving it. Not an easy game, you genuinely feel like you're fighting the car and the road with every bump, bend and turn. Palms are sweaty just thinking about it"
4368,best text editor,I just hope they eventually add multi-window support. I actually moved to a 38 inch ultrawide primarily so that I could display 3 VS Code tabs side by side.
32806,best free online grammar checker,Thank you. I used grammarly in the end and it was very good. Very embarrassing how much I had missed. I'm definitely going to do some brushing up!
741,best baskin robbins flavor reddit,"Ugh, someone that finally understands me. Scraping tubs is probably my least favorite thing too, next to interacting with all the people.......
I also hate when an ice cream is particularly hard to scoop and someone orders something that requires like ten scoops. Some of my tears may have gotten into their triple large milkshake.
German Chocolate Cake is currently available in pre-packed quarts! (In my store, at least.)


Just to add, two of my biggest pet peeves are when either 
a) people tap on the glass to get my attention while I'm scooping like I'm an animal in a zoo
b) people ask me questions like, ""What does strawberry taste like?"""

49470,best gaming monitor,"Nevermind, it doesn't have a vesa mount and I need it. Fffffff"
66704,best soccer team in the world,"Kezman was kinda struggling by 2006. Still led the line for Serbia & Montenegro and I think top scored for them in qualifying, but he wasn't great at club level. He had a minor revival at Fener and then just faded away. Massive shame. One of my favourite players at PSV."

4684,best home improvement store,"Just so everyone knows, that fridge *[probably] really never sold for $2600.00.  That could be the MSRP, that is always high.  It probably retailed for $1500.00 - $1900.00.  Not saying you didn't get a good deal, because you did, but they always like to make it look better than it really is. 

* I apologize for upsetting the Lowes fan boy."

43598,best items under $100,"> Hmmm, should I stay inside and lay down?  Or shall I go outside and lay down?

-- Op"
68908,best science fiction novel,This thread is full of people very vehemently telling me how little they care.
56896,best water brand,"There's a local grocery chain with the cheapest off-brand bottled water. Its definitely tap water from somewhere, but it beats my local municipal water which tastes like chlorine, and that bottled water tastes the most like properly treated city water of any bottled water I've had.


But, other than that, a properly treated and kept well impossible to beat. Well water has all of the minerals that water should, the only danger is of course if it becomes contaminated.


Also, Disani is shit."
62825,Best Data Science textbook,"Christopher Manning's Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing is a must-have for any NLP practitioner. I recently purchased it and it's very good; theory-heavy and from 1999, but most, if not all, of the book is relevant today."
62809,Best Data Science textbook,Anyone have any suggestions for podcasts?
29106,best calendar tool,No in app task manager though.
1541,best ice cream flavor,"The tasso ice cream had a lovely balance of savory and sweet with a touch of smoke and a spicy finish. I don't know you'd recognize it as ham flavor if you weren't told, though. It was served with a hot crawfish pie and the contrasting temperatures and texures worked very well."
16200,best sunglasses for fashion,"I don't know much about sunglasses, what makes a pair worth the money? Just how durable they feel?"
70655,best movies with a cool twist,Iunderstoodthatreference.gif
56665,best desktop monitor,"While it will likely be there, you may not even notice it, especially if you've never gamed without adaptive sync before. Also, remember that you are looking at stationary pictures you will only see the tear. When moving in game, it is constantly refreshing the image on screen so the tear isn't in the exact same spot every time. I wouldn't worry too much about adaptive sync and it is still considered a ""luxury"" feature."
