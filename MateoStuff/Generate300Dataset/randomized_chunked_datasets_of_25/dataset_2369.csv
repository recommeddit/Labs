22431,"I got hired to work a gig setting up a big LED wall for an afternoon for a musical act on a late night talk show.  We worked our asses off getting the LED wall ready, and had a while between the performance and tear down. We were told we could go to the green room to grab some water/sodas/whatever, but not to stay in there if there was anyone else and don’t bother any celebrities. We grab some sodas and walk out of the green room. One giant wall of the green room was all glass, so we went on the other side of the glass wall and hung out, hoping to catch a glimpse of any celebrities. 

Eventually Danny Devito walks into the green room, on the other side of the glass wall from us. Unbeknownst to any of us he was the celebrity guest that day. He waves at us from the other side of the wall, and then starts gesturing to all of us making the international hand gesture implying to smoke a joint. We’re all laughing and confused. He walks through the glass door into the same room with us and asks if any of us smoke pot. 

I was ready right then and there to get fired for smoking a joint with Danny Devito, but unfortunately no one had anything. We shot the shit with him for a little while and told him he was awesome, etc. 

Man I wish I could have gotten fired that day. He was an awesome guy to meet.",best celebrity

Prob will get hate but the ladies like it.

Just don't get Sauvage. That shit is for old malt whiskey sipping dudes. 

Also if you want to start cheaper look into Ed Hardy Skulls and Roses. It smells pretty much like Montblanc Legend Spirit for alot less.",best cologne
54912,"It's also why the ingredients to Dasani water isn't just water, they use a high grade filtration process like that, they filter out just about all the minerals, and that means they filter out the taste of the local water. They then have to add minerals back into it to make it drinkable (it tastes terrible without the minerals). This also means that it tastes exactly the same no matter what the water source is (which is great for a company like coca-cola that sells everywhere in the country and has hundreds of water sources).",best water filter
41063,"Piano definitely. Is not easier than the others at all, but you have a lot of advantages:

1. It is visual friendly

Right goes up
Down goes down
And that's it

2. Technic

You can improve your technic skills during all your lifetime, but you push, it sounds
And that's it

3. Balanced price

You can take a very good electronic piano that will be with you for many years (if you be careful) for 360 euros. I have had the Yamaha P-85 for 6 years. And it is in perfect conditions.

4. The great MIDI

With the MIDI system you will be able to record not even the best piano ever, but any instrument (in a superior quality). You will be able to play a harp, drums, flute, and the sound of a helicopter. Literally what you want

5. You can play at night

You can use headphones! With the violin, drums, trumpet, you can't. You can change the volume.

6. Not the best transportation but you can carry it easily

With the correct case you can transport it. It is not the most comfortable instrument to carry but it is possible.

7. With a electronic one (i recommend you that one) you don't have to tune it!

It is expensive to tune it (I'm sorry tuners, i know it is a very experience and dedicate, and delicate work) and your ear trains better (since it is always perfectly tune). Also, you can tune another instrument having this reference.

8. Clefs

You will learn to read in the 2 most common clefs

9. You have a lot of sheet music wrote for piano, more than banjo, flute and bassoon.

I guess I have a few more reasons but it is enough now. All the instruments are beautiful. I only recommend you one to start. It is easier to study theory too.

I'm a piano professor and I love it.

I wish you the best with any decision!!!
