36436,best alcoholic drink,"Don't knock it until you try it! (at a friend's expense...you know, in case you don't like it.)"
33933,best Pokemon game,"Just Google it and go their webpage. You have to download the client from their site (Android only) and upload the required ROMs (fire red, emerald, black/white and heart gold/soul silver.)"
29248,best game console,"Ps3 if you want to get the expensive games before they increase even more.

Wii and Wii U if you want to collect a bunch of hidden gems and awesome games for cheap before every other collector jumps into them.

OG Xbox and Xbox 360 if you want a large collection of great games for excellent prices.

Other than that, whatever seems the most interesting to you. Personally, Iâ€™m working on my Ps3 and Dreamcast collections."

Though my personal favorite is when he doing ATC and belts out 45 sec of flawless jargon in one breath and caps it with a ""full read back required"""

33980,best Pokemon game,"My recommendation is either Sword or Shield (differences are minimal) or wait for Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl in November. Theyâ€™re your typical PokÃ©mon games with the formula that more or less have been in place since Gen 1, but upgraded/enhanced after 25 years. 

If you liked PokÃ©mon GO and the catching system then I heard Letâ€™s Go Eevee/Pikachu are good (plus Iâ€™m bias towards Kanto) but the experience wonâ€™t be traditional"

If itâ€™s not BIFL, then something highly repairable is the next best thing."

22065,best celebrity,"I have told this story on here a couple of times, but here it is again!

I used to work in an upscale hotel in West Hollywood. I was in one day when a beautiful brunette about my age, another pretty blonde woman, and an older lady who I assumed was the mother of one or both of them came in. She looked vaguely familiar, and it dawned on me that I was serving Annie from Community (Alison Brie) whose wikipedia article I had recently looked up. I glanced at their reservation. Schumerhorn. That's her real last name.

Before I even realized who she was, I noticed she must literally have a magical aura around her that makes everyone within 10 feet feel special. I got to wait on her, and she bullshitted with me like I was an old friend. By the end of the afternoon we were talking to each other in stupid accents and laughing like hyenas, and to top it all off she left a great tip and her friend told my boss what a great job I'd done. Nice to meet someone you love from a show and it turns out they're cool as fuck."
33252,best electric car,"You would need solar to fully realize that feature.  Otherwise you'd be draining your truck's battery, decreasing it's available range per day and needing to find a public charger after a few days."

51990,best iphone case,"Thereâ€™s just better value (and protection) for the money imo. i didnâ€™t like the feel of it, nor did I feel like my device was protected, also in/out the pocket is a hassle. The mous case ultimately influenced my decision."
15015,best romantic novel,"Okay, I know everyone thinks Nicholas Sparks is trash, but I really liked *The Guardian*."
52330,best hiphop album,"Iâ€™ve been listening actively listening to hiphop since â€˜93. I listened to Eminem non-stop from â€˜00 until â€˜05. So itâ€™s been about 15 years since he was my favorite rapper. I revisit his music sometimes, but I love 2pac, Biggie, Snoop Dogg, Wu Tang and Mobb Deepâ€™s music more. 

I used to love every lyrically complex rap out there. Now itâ€™s less important to me. I still like rappers like Kendrick, Pusha T and Joey Bada$$. But I also like Travi$ Scott, A$AP Rocky, Young Thug, Drake (sometimes) and 21 Savage. Different types of raps for different moods and occasions."
