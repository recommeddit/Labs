Wii and Wii U if you want to collect a bunch of hidden gems and awesome games for cheap before every other collector jumps into them.

OG Xbox and Xbox 360 if you want a large collection of great games for excellent prices.

Other than that, whatever seems the most interesting to you. Personally, Iâ€™m working on my Ps3 and Dreamcast collections.",best game console

If you liked PokÃ©mon GO and the catching system then I heard Letâ€™s Go Eevee/Pikachu are good (plus Iâ€™m bias towards Kanto) but the experience wonâ€™t be traditional",best Pokemon game

I used to work in an upscale hotel in West Hollywood. I was in one day when a beautiful brunette about my age, another pretty blonde woman, and an older lady who I assumed was the mother of one or both of them came in. She looked vaguely familiar, and it dawned on me that I was serving Annie from Community (Alison Brie) whose wikipedia article I had recently looked up. I glanced at their reservation. Schumerhorn. That's her real last name.

Before I even realized who she was, I noticed she must literally have a magical aura around her that makes everyone within 10 feet feel special. I got to wait on her, and she bullshitted with me like I was an old friend. By the end of the afternoon we were talking to each other in stupid accents and laughing like hyenas, and to top it all off she left a great tip and her friend told my boss what a great job I'd done. Nice to meet someone you love from a show and it turns out they're cool as fuck.",best celebrity

52330,"Iâ€™ve been listening actively listening to hiphop since â€˜93. I listened to Eminem non-stop from â€˜00 until â€˜05. So itâ€™s been about 15 years since he was my favorite rapper. I revisit his music sometimes, but I love 2pac, Biggie, Snoop Dogg, Wu Tang and Mobb Deepâ€™s music more. 

I used to love every lyrically complex rap out there. Now itâ€™s less important to me. I still like rappers like Kendrick, Pusha T and Joey Bada$$. But I also like Travi$ Scott, A$AP Rocky, Young Thug, Drake (sometimes) and 21 Savage. Different types of raps for different moods and occasions.",best hiphop album
