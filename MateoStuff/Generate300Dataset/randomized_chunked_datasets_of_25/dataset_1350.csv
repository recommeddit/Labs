You can visit both Citizen’s Bank Park and the Flyer’s stadium. See the statue of Rocky. The Franklin Institute and the Philadelphia Art museum are great places to learn. Plus the cheesesteaks are great.

More to the point though. I would say don’t go to a big city. Visit smaller towns.",best state to visit in the United States

14580,"I always, always, ALWAYS want to recommend [The Widow of Rose House by Diana Biller](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250297853)!!

It was my most surprising read of the last year and I love it dearly. 

The heroine is a recent widow who has spent years fleeing scandal (and her abusive husband.) She is determined to restore this Gothic mansion in Gilded-Age New York, but OOPS there are ghosts. The hero, an eccentric (and hunky) scientist is itching to study the house's paranormal elements. Sparks fly. 

It sounds SO absurd but it has so much heart and is spooky and lovely.",best romantic novel

548,"It depenc a bit on what you are looking for if you just want to annotate PDF's you want something different then when you want to take meeting notes or lecture notes. (IMHO)

[OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhvjl) (Free)

A full on notebook replacement:

+ + Cross device/ Platform sync
+ + Optimized for the New Surface Pen
+ + Endless page good when the Notes get longer and not just fill in on the PDF
-  - Highlighting dose not stay on text
- - Exporting is more difficult since the page dose not stay with standard sizes

[Drawboard PDF](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfhwqt) ($9.99 right now on sell for $6.99)

A perfect PDF annotation App.


+ + Highlighting stays on the text
+ + Pages stay in the size of the original document
+ - Not very many non PDF features
+ - Not very good for organizing documents and keeping them in one place

[Xodo PDF Reader & Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdjxp4) (Free)

I can not say much about this one since I have not used it yet.


I personally use OneNote to keep my Notes organized, school, work, life. I have Notebooks for everything. Each Semester I make a new notebook for school, each Client has their own notebook, and big projects in life have their own notebook too. (Yes I have a Notebook dedicated to my 2 year old)

I use Drawboard for reading long PDF's and highlighting. I tried using it for note taking in class but I always run out of space. I don't use it for meeting notes either since I sometimes have pictures or web links in them and I find OneNote more useful for that.",best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit

39797,"This one is so weird to me because when I was a kid and had just discovered the internet I was typing in random strings of words to see if they got anywhere, and one of them was CamelCamelCamel.com. It didn’t go anywhere at the time (2007ish) but my friends all thought it was hilarious. We spent a week laughing about CamelCamelCamel and wondering what the website would do.

Now it’s an actual thing. What the fuck.

EDIT: To those of you asking if my friends were somehow involved, nope. Just a massive coincidence. I don't remember most of the kids' names, since I haven't seen them for years, but the website was founded in 2008. The OLDEST they could've been is 10. Knowing the kind of kids at that school, that actually wasn't entirely impossible (tech geeks, young coding prodigies), so I looked into it more. There's practically no information on Daniel Green, the founder. I had to scroll all the way to the bottom of the his Twitter feed to be sure. In 2012 he was selling a house in Utah. I live in Minnesota, and anyway if he was one of the kids there he couldn't've been older than 14 by then. [This](https://twitter.com/camelfarmer/status/258964977581424640) is not a 14-year-old's tweet.",best Chrome extensions
