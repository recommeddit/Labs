56207,best action and adventure movie,"seconding Fury Road - action is non-stop from jump, no time to get bored!"
604,best vpn for torrenting reddit,"[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=60707&url_id=902) is the best VPN now, really. It has the best speeds and most stable connections. Torguard isn't my favourite, it disconnected me from the server quite a lot"
33235,best electric car,"First in line because I reserved like 10 minutes into the presentation of the reveal. So I'm probably within the first 10k.

Ford has been pretty clear that they will sell the Pro model alongside other trims to consumers. You just cannot get extended range as a consumer, to get that they force you into the higher prices trims.

A recent ford event noted that most reservation interest is for higher trims, so they don't need to force the higher margin more than they already do. Lots of people who buy trucks already are spending 50k+.

I would take a Tesla as well and deal with the monstrosity that it is... I have a pre order for it as well. But I wouldn't expect a purchase until 2024 given my preorder date and they already delayed into 2022.  I would take a duel motor as it's a great value. I had initially thought single motor but I honestly doubt theyd ever produce it... If they do it's probably past 2024 :)"
31692,best hotel to live in,"This is starting to sound like a VHS vs. DVD or CD vs. MP3 conversation. I don't care what the natural progression is, I love the feel of books!"
33406,best electric car,"Yeah, I’d heard of their name for a long time but was dubious about whether they’d actually become a player in the EV market. That is, until Amazon contracted them."
65880,best college in california,"You should know that the above post isn't 100% correct. I'm currently looking into MBA and UCLA business is actually more expensive than USC, even for in-state students, but it really isn't by much (~$125k vs ~$115k). If you care about rankings and want an alumni network that will work for you then your only options are Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA or USC. You can't really go wrong with any of those. If you just want a business degree to say you have a business degree, I would go to a CSU instead of any other UC.

edit: Just want to say I am not making a dig at the CSU. I went to a CSU for undergrad and it was awesome and opened up a lot of opportunities, but if you are looking to go to a top company, your chances will be much, much higher at Berkeley, UCLA, USC and Stanford."
15888,best sunglasses for fashion,The Prada squares are one of my favorites. Especially on people with well defined cheekbones.
40198,best midrange CPU,"I would take the opposite side of your k skus complaint, particularly since B560 boards now offer XMP. Overclocking is no longer worth the money."
28924,best breakfast foods,I want to try that recipe in the morning! Question. I’m a new cook so bear with me. Does he cook the bacon first before he wraps it around the edge of the muffin cup? And how many egg muffins does he cook? Just trying to figure out how many servings the recipe is.
53335,best usb c charging cable,Anker is the best.
33098,best energy drink,love me some purple drank

68933,best science fiction novel,"The plot comes so far out of left field, wastes your time and at the end , you're scratching your head. 

I don't want to post spoilers.  But even for a horror there were moments where I was like , wtf ?"
46141,best trick or treating candy,Growing up one of my neighbors worked for Nestle. Every kid in the neighborhood got several king size candy bars. Halloween in our neighborhood is one of my favorite childhood memories.
36805,best alcoholic drink,Gin and tonic
2813,best headphones,"Selam, evet MH751’im var."
53382,best usb c charging cable,"I wasn't intending to suggest estimating the construction through the weight, I was intending to suggest that reviews might measure the weight because travelers might want to know. It's just that the unknown wire gauge also suggested the weight difference."
47803,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,Not necessarily. At my university it’s actually a co requisite to know how to use a CAS calculator
49378,best gaming monitor,Had a dead pixel on the LG and it got annoying as it was in the center. Got a 2 year plan from micro center so that covered it
61159,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Frasier. 


Very witty and funny."
28259,best breakfast foods,"Eggs southwestern over hard. 

Eggs with salt pepper and crushed red pepper cooked over hard, placed on tortillas with cheese and guacamole. Steak if I have any, simply heated up from leftover in a pan with a little butter."
20407,best workout music,I listen to the Vikings soundtrack when I row at the gym.
52531,best hiphop album,"I just love the tone of the album. I wish more hip hop was like that, dark, brooding, ominous, a bit atmospheric, but doesn't overtake the rapping either"
62184,Best RPG game on PS4,"Yeah, I disagree. I'll admit that it lacks the replayability of an rpg, but it is definitely fun. People often times equate arcady games to fun and realistic games as slow or boring. I would argue that I haven't had more fun playing a game than when I played Red Dead."
72651,best wireless lightweight mouse,Damn sorry to hear that. Never a fun experience
