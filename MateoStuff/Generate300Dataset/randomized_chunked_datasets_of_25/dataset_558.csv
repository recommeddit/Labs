33235,"First in line because I reserved like 10 minutes into the presentation of the reveal. So I'm probably within the first 10k.

Ford has been pretty clear that they will sell the Pro model alongside other trims to consumers. You just cannot get extended range as a consumer, to get that they force you into the higher prices trims.

A recent ford event noted that most reservation interest is for higher trims, so they don't need to force the higher margin more than they already do. Lots of people who buy trucks already are spending 50k+.

I would take a Tesla as well and deal with the monstrosity that it is... I have a pre order for it as well. But I wouldn't expect a purchase until 2024 given my preorder date and they already delayed into 2022.  I would take a duel motor as it's a great value. I had initially thought single motor but I honestly doubt theyd ever produce it... If they do it's probably past 2024 :)",best electric car

65880,"You should know that the above post isn't 100% correct. I'm currently looking into MBA and UCLA business is actually more expensive than USC, even for in-state students, but it really isn't by much (~$125k vs ~$115k). If you care about rankings and want an alumni network that will work for you then your only options are Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA or USC. You can't really go wrong with any of those. If you just want a business degree to say you have a business degree, I would go to a CSU instead of any other UC.

edit: Just want to say I am not making a dig at the CSU. I went to a CSU for undergrad and it was awesome and opened up a lot of opportunities, but if you are looking to go to a top company, your chances will be much, much higher at Berkeley, UCLA, USC and Stanford.",best college in california
