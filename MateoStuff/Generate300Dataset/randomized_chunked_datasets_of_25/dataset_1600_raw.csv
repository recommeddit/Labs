"I have the Acer XF270HU display and love it. 144hz, IPS LED panel. no complaints at all.

Not sure if there is a newer model out there. Amazon has some other [similar models but they are TN panels](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-XF270HU-Cbmiiprzx-FREESYNC-Technology/dp/B07G3RLJVW?th=1)."
When “yes” is both a meme and the correct response.
"I still think Australia in 00 were slightly better.

They had 2 longest winning streaks of 16 tests as compared to one from WI of 11 matches.

Also no disrespect to team of 70s/80s but I think the quality of opposing teams was better and number of teams were more in 00-10

India and Sri Lanka had much better teams in 2000s. Pakistan team which lost 3-0 to Australia in 2000 was most likely their best team ever."

"I have ATH-M50s and they are fantastic, but I recommend buying [these](http://www.amazon.com/Shure-HPAEC840-Replacement-Cushions-Headphones/dp/B002Z9JWZS) pads along with them. The stock pads are extremely uncomfortable, but with the Shure's I can easily listen to an entire album without adjusting them at all."
People in this thread have played too many JRPGs and don't understand what an RPG even is anymore.. An action game like *Diablo* is more similar to a D&D session than anything in the Tales series.
"I don't know if Marriott is the best, but I've never been disappointed in one. For me it's really about meeting a basic level of cleanliness and professionalism, then everything else is bonus. About 7 years ago all the mid-tier Marriots (Springhill, Courtyard, etc) seemed to have been revamped to pretty cool modern designs too.

I'm probably out of date since it's been nearly 10 years since I did regular business travel, but back then I actually jumped from Hilton to Marriott as the mid-tier Hilton chain near my project was always dirty. Discovering that I earned free nights from Marriott at more than twice the rate per stay was just an added bonus. (Again that was 10 years ago, the rewards part may have changed)"
okay. but why? it costs time trying new apps.
"The research does not matter, all that matters is what works where you spend the time the most. I have all 3 carriers and they mostly all use the same towers. In some locations Verizon is terrible even with great signal. For instance, at home I get 0.5up/and down on Verizon , 40/2 on AT&T, and 20/6 on T-mobile. Verizon has the best signal strength, but their equipment is massively overloaded. They probably have T-1's instead of fiber. 

A few miles down the road they switch rank and all are in the 100/20 area.

Ultimately in comes down to what gives you the most bang for your buck, but the carriers are all pretty good."
"That's kind of true, but it also depends on what you are trying to achieve. If you have sensitivity you should use sensitive toothpaste (ie. Sensodyne or other tooth paste specific for sensitive teeth and there are different ones with different mechanisms which I will not bore you with), if you want your teeth to be 'whiter' get a 'whitening' toothpaste (I put it in quotes BC it's not physically making your teeth whiter, just removing surface stain better), if you get cavities easily use a toothpaste with higher fluoride content (ex. Colgate prevident 5000), and if your teeth are just normal you can pretty much use whatever you want (preferably with fluoride in it) and for god sake, please floss!"
"Ha, we got all our paint from Benjamin Moore and bought their sample jars first to test.  They're like $6 per jar, must have spent $300 on samples before we found the perfect color....that looked ten times lighter once the wall was painted!"

"Here's a [image](http://i.imgur.com/OmMZVnN.jpg) of healthiest alcohols. I'm not saying this is 100% accurate, but it's not terrible.

In case this isn't just about getting a buzz, I will recommend [session beers](http://www.beeradvocate.com/articles/653/). Session beers are good if you want low alcohol (and thus usually low calorie) beers that don't sacrifice flavor. more alcohol content = more calories, but b/c beer is a lot of carbs, liquor will probably be better bet if you JUST want to get buzzed. But liquor still has a ton of calories.

Personally, beer is my one main vice when it comes to fitness. I really like beer so I exercise but I enjoy beer a lot. A lot of higher alcohol beers may get you buzzed quicker and won't require 3+ beers to get the job done (like light beers). Try something like [chimay blue](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/chimay-bleue-blue--grande-reserve/53/). Although it's 270 calories, at 9% abv, it's gonna get you buzzed faster.

TL;DR - if you want a buzz but don't want as many calories, try liquor, if you want to still drink beer, try a bigger beer (higher abv beer), it *may* get you buzzed faster for less calories. If you want flavor, drink a session beer."
"+1 to the safety razor! Cad45 on Amazon, another 20 for blades and I haven’t looked back since

Edit: 

WEISHI Nostalgic Long Handle Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Reusable Razor https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00VYA0SU2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_JN9WNTB67JGKNE021V0M?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

I see that it’s now being marketed as a woman’s razor... cool cool.

It’s now CAD26!

And:

Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades, 100 count https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B001QY8QXM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_JRG1BNV769P86M0C7NRG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

CAD18.

100 blades were overkill but I don’t think I’ll ever spend any more money on blades!"
"They also have fantastic customer service. I bought a douvet cover off of society6 last year, it ended up not being what I needed and I reached out to them about returning it. They refunded 100% of my money and told me to keep or donate it"

"This may be completely wrong, since when I had this question last year I had significant trouble finding a definitive answer, but I think another thing that matters in distinguishing between R1/R2/SLAC is the amount of teaching that professors are expected to do. At an R1 school teaching is relatively low priority, while at SLAC (selective liberal arts consortium) teachers have a much larger course load. R2 falls somewhere in between; they are expected to keep an active lab but may also teach a few classes per semester."
