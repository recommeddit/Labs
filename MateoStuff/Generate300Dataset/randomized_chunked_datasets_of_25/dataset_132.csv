28241,best breakfast foods,"Breakfast quinoa! I usually cook some quinoa in either coconut or almond milk with brown sugar, then add banana slices and toasted coconut when serving. It's nice because you can make a big batch and then refrigerate it. It keeps me pretty full, too.   

ETA: [This](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/breakfast-quinoa) is the recipe I use!"
47571,best state to visit in the United States,"Utah. 

So many beautiful National Parks."
22336,best celebrity,"He is a really strong person, seriously. So many child stars fall prey to the dreaded ""child star syndrome"" and go off the rails HARD once their big break roles end, but he really overcame it and has blossomed since. 100% one of my most respected actors, in my book."
4296,best text editor,**exactly** what i was going to say.
26407,best politician,So can we just synthesize that all into the ability to not be a human fucking being and exist only as a corrupt hellspawn?
23810,best car racing video game,"The most realistic racing game is iracing which is good pratice, but i like playing grid for fun."
65145,best phone service company,"I did it a few years ago, and I remember it being super simple. I ported my number out, and they closed my account after the one remaining payment on my phone was auto-drafted."
5201,best home improvement store,I return stuff to hd without receipts maybe once a week! Generally lowes is more expensive than home depot too.
57256,best water brand,What is (an)  RO?
68708,best science fiction novel,The Quantum Thief series is so underrated. I second this.
69212,best major to study in college,"Well said.

I would be remiss to say that my success have been 100% luck.

Moved to 5 different cities in 5 years, taking on ever more challenging roles. 

However, a lot of it was being in the ""right place and the right time for sure. 

I simply worked very hard to do my part to be prepared, ready, and able when opportunities presented themselves."
2830,best headphones,Thats unfortunate. I couldn't find many headsets beyond 20 hours though sony do have a 35 hour headset. On sale for £40 which I had gotten that now instead of my 20 hour headset for £35 lol.
57720,best cologne,"I definitely recommend Spicebomb as well. I bought it when I was specifically looking for something a bit more unique and memorable. Even though it stands out, I've never had anyone tell me that it bothers them. Just don't try to bring the bottle on an airplane; it looks like a grenade.

As an added plus, my partner wears Flowerbomb (also by V&R) so when we go out, she and I can even wear matching fragrances"
8580,best toothpaste,"Before you throw out the old head get a pair of pliers and rip off the two magnets. They are fairly strong and quite handy because...

MAGNETS!!!"
18883,best YouTube video,Anything by penguinz0 actually. Here is my personal favorite: http://youtu.be/MVu496LdCko?list=UUq6VFHwMzcMXbuKyG7SQYIg
25628,best cricket teams of all time,"Not to critique too harshly what is awesome work it is more a philosophical point: shouldn't teams that play more cricket (either in that form or overall) be somewhat advantaged in the rankings. I would also council about going too far the other way with the ICC rankings being very steadfast and your rankings poo-pooing a decent team after a bad run.

One more thing I'd think you could evaluate perhaps the venue could be taken into account. For example an Indian team winning in England is worth more than a Pakistani team winning in India. There are other examples of this but the premier example of this is it is very hard to beat a subcontinent team if you aren't from the subcontinent so perhaps weighing could be given to this."
7329,best laptop for general use,"The HP would be the better choice because it is from a more recent generation, so despite only have 7 CUs, it will out perform the older Vega 8."
72491,best keyboard switches,"I prefer Cherry MX Reds and Romer G's from Logitech. I know I may get a bunch of shit for liking Romer G's, but they are seriously one nice switch (made by Omeron). I freaking love typing on my G810, and I believe that my room-mates appreciate it too!"
29931,best money managing app,"1 week early for me, thx! I followed the link and downloaded the app, signed in with Google and working with it now. Not sure how the free trial works but I guess I'll find out. Seems to be working now"

44660,best items under $100,"> Sonicare tooth brush - like getting a cleaning done every time I brush my teeth. Also whitened my smile.

Most of them are so expensive when people are better off with the lowest model. No need for Bluetooth or ""smart"" gimmicks. 

Oral-B is even more affordable and the rounded head is easier for plaque removal."
