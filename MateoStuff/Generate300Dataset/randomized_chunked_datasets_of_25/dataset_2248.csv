54453,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"The dpi was an accident. I have two dpi adjustment buttons on my Razer Naga mouse, and had accidentally turned it all the way to maximum (8200 dpi) and just got used to it for a period of years. I didn't realize that was fast until I was talking to a friend about a new mouse/mousepad last week, which was when I cut it back to 4400 - less feels very sluggish to me for the moment. I'm going to try to move myself down to a more realistic setting, which hopefully the added control from a good pad will help with. Fun fact since I'm talking about it, my total range of motion with my mouse was about half an inch to cross both monitors.

 I play mostly stuff like Path of Exile, Hades, and some League. Shooters I always swap to controller for, bad habit from my xbox days. Also probably because it's very difficult to have stable aim on 8200 dpi. 

I think based off what you've said I'll go for the soft and see how that plays out."
