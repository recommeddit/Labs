17383,best iOS game,I have Downwell but not really into it. Why do you think it's good?
22979,best celebrity,"Jaden Smith wouldn't leave my store thirty minutes after we closed. Neither would his security guard, the girl he was with, or the eight or nine other girls that were clearly asked to stay at least thirty feet away from him. 
 
He kept saying ""Bro, it's cool. Don't worry, bro, it's cool. It's cool""  
 
Fuck you Jaden, there are about twenty people in this store that can't go home until you get your stupid entitled ass out of here.  
 
**EDIT:**  The next day he accused a hotel down the street of trying to poison him with ~~cheese in his pancakes~~ ricotta in his crepes? 
 
**EDIT 2:** Just to clear a couple of things up: 
He did eventually leave about ten minutes after I asked, but not before finishing his shopping and holdup up our staff. And unfortunately our store leadership will bend over backwards (the won't call security or back me up in the removing of late shoppers) for pretty much anyone, so unless I could convince Jaden to leave, they'd have let him keep shopping."
22627,best celebrity,"Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon. I met him last year and he has completely lost touch with the public. He seems to think that he is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It made me really sad because I had looked up to him for my entire childhood."
36513,best alcoholic drink,"it'll get ya blind drunk, i know that."
52436,best hiphop album,"Thats a interesting perspective, I always thought the album sonically flowed well.. and all the hottest producers at the time were on it but somehow the project had the same sound of that makes sense .... But I mite just listen to it n refresh with an open mind about what u said"
9384,best toothpaste,Oral-b
60908,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Well it's definitely subjective. I just commented because I didn't want someone to read that and think they should skip those seasons or something, because plenty of people like them."
19701,best YouTube video,"I'm guessing everyone else has blocked it out from their memory: [""What What (In the Butt)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbGkxcY7YFU)"
15290,best tree for the garden,Sounds like my day-to-day life tbh
57527,best water brand,"Indonesian here. Any brand, except for amidis, that damned water was taken straight from the deepest abyss of tartarus."
42366,movies like Inception,Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe go fuck yourself.
35089,best NFL player,Wrong Johnny. You meant to say $$$ Manziel $$$
42287,movies like Inception,"If it were made of spare ribs, would you eat it? I know I would!"
6662,best iPhone,"My friend got a refurbished SE for ~300 bucks(can probably find it cheaper), has had zero issues and worked beautifully. If you're worried about battery you can always try to find an iPhone 7 Apple battery case, will fit and work just fine. Just might be somewhat pricey as the used market is a little lacking for it. Managed to get one for 50 bucks used. Pair it with a decent screen protector and boom you're good for a while.

But, I hear rumors they're going to release an upgraded version of the SE this year or early next year. 

They're also supposed to release the next version of the iphone ""mini"" which might also be the last version. Like others have said probably the closest thing to what you have, so if you want something similar in size and shape I would hold off for a month to see what they drop. 

As always, get a good quality case and screen protector. HIGHLY recommend flolab screen protectors. Nothing beats them especially for the price. 

Try and get an eco friendly case if possible(if you don't need a battery case), otherwise that stuff is wasted material that's now stuck here forever. Recommend GoNimble or Pela cases.

Alternatively, 
Fair phone is quickly gaining traction especially for its eco friendly features, and with easily replaceable and upgradeable components it should last you QUITE a while. 

Terracube is also a great option(and the only thing we can get in the US as well haha)"

73101,best Linux distro,Which distro are you using on your new (used) laptop?
10255,best pencil for drawing,"I prefer leadholders to traditional mechanicals, esp for drawing/sketching (engineering technical sketches).

Rotring makes a 2mm leadholder, btw. Aluminum body, very nice. Knurling is a little too aggressive if you ask me, but still a good pencil. Staetdler also makes good plastic bodied leadholders--my favorite feature of this pencil is the sharpener in the tube cap--which comes in handy more often than you'd think.

My favorite pencil for drawing/sketching is my Lamy 5.6mm lead holder, which is quite t h i c c, but is a joy to use."
6638,best iPhone,Wait and see if the 13 Mini is any good. Release next month (if shortages aren't too bad)
16319,best sunglasses for fashion,I have a pair of the Lowrys and I like them a lot. They also use no-scratch lenses and they'll replace them if they do get scratched.
30251,best Mexican war to study,"We didnâ€™t talk a whole lot about it except for the fact that we invaded.  Battle of Monterrey I think?  It was mainly talked about as being sort of a precursor to the Civil War:  it was the training ground for several big names, it exacerbated the representation debate between slave states and free states, and continued the precedent of conquest"
10765,best suitcase lock,And they find that you're trolling them because all that's in your bag is a hundred rape alarms that all go off when they open it.
