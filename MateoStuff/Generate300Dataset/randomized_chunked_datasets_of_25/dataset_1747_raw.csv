"The football they played though, is still one of the best i have ever seen. Even as a United fan i couldn't do anything else then painfully enjoy it."

Certain amount of fiction (or creative freedom) is allowed in movies. Still his role was much believable than say Aamir Khan in Mangal Pandey.
Try mount and blade. Not quite what you asked. But fun
"I used to always be on the rap train for workouts but recently switched over to 

Inky Johnson and Eric Thomas
Hearing stories and powerful messages help push me in a further way. 

Along with that, youtube has alot of really well put together motivational videos with speeches cut into very motivating music. Def a look into if you are searching for music. 

Edit: Inky Johnson & Eric Thomas are both on spotify /// And search Bodybuilding motivation on youtube."

"70s-80s WI had to face   
England - Gooch, Boycott, Gower, Botham, Willis, Underwood, Knott  
Australia - Chappell brothers, Border, Lillee, Thompson, Mallet  
Pakistan -Miandad, Abbas, Imran  
India - Gavaskar, Viswanath, Vengsarkar, Kapil, Kirmani and the spin quartet (Not a weak team as you suggested)  
NZ was competitive with Hadlee  

Again we are talking about an era where 50+ average is pretty much impossible unlike now there seems to be couple per team.  

90s-00 Aus team had to face  

England - Peterson  
India - Tendulkar, Dravid, VVS  
Pakistan - Inzamam, Wasim, Waquar  
NZ - ??  
SA - Kirsten, Kallis, Donald, Pollock  
SL - De Silva, Murali    

So, I wouldn't come to a conclusion that WI had to face weaker sides.  In my biased opinion, WI beat everybody at home and on the road handily for a long period of time. Aus never beat India in India. That settles the argument for me."

"I had been out of the home for 2 weeks because of an fight with my mom. Was couch surfing at the time. The night income home, my pregnant cat kept meowing at me. I would get up and she would go into my closet. I would settle her in then get in my bed. Out she was again, meowing at me. So finally I took my pillow and just set up bunk in the closet with her.

She immediately went into labour."

"You usually can, just right click and press Show Controller I think (on mobile now). Also you just watch the gif to get the gist/inspiration, then go to the comments for the details."
"You are right. Impact wise he is number 1 then Sehwag and then Dravid. Although correct me If i am wrong, only Dravid can lay claim to single -handedly winning a game for india outside the subcontinent."
"It’s definitely a top tier origin movie, but it wasn’t without big flaws in my opinion. I really liked the first two acts of the movie, they felt more grounded. It got a little crazy in the third act, but there were some great moments so it was forgivable. The way they killed Wenwu, one of the best villains in the MCU, was not forgivable. I couldn’t believe they did him like that. Also, the way Katy killed the soul sucker with just one arrow with one day of training did not make any sense. I feel like wandavision suffered a similar third act problem where they had an amazing, creative show and it devolved into a DBZ fight in the end. 

I did really like it though. Gonna probably see it again soon."
