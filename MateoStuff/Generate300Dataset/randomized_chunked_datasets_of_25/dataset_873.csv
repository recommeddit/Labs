42208,"Not a movie, but if OP wants a mind fuck, just read anything by Philip K. Dick (who wrote the novel A Scanner Darkly).  Dude was one giant mindfuck.  And was legit insane and a drug addict.  He believed there was an invisible satellite orbiting earth that was an alien intelligence, but also god?  And that he was living two lives.  Philip K. Dick, a scifi writer in the 1970s as well as Thomas, a devout Christian living in the first century AD.  And he thought the FBI had broken into his house to look for illegal activity but later decided he had broken into his own home.  Dude was nuts, but an awesome storyteller.  Every time I read a Dick novel, I put it down after I finish it and just kinda think ""What.  The.  Fuck.  Did I just read?  And did I like it?  Fuck, did I even understand what the fuck happened?""  And then I go outside for a bit because I just need some air.",movies like Inception

68252,"House of Suns, Alastair Reynolds - Epic in scope, mind blowing space opera. We really need a sequel to this one.

The Songs of Distant Earth, Arthur C. Clarke - Sad, hopeful, with elegant and concise prose. Clarke on record saying it's his favorite novel he's written, but it gets little attention.

Seveneves, Neal Stephenson - Epic on scope. Like The Martian but saving the human race, not just one man. People disliked the third act, I loved the whole book.

Gateway, Frederik Pohl - The first true science fiction book I ever read. Mystery, tragedy, with multi-genre elements.

Nova, Samuel R. Delany - Space opera before space opera was a thing.",best science fiction novel

58782,"You're both right. Most folks who spend a moderate amount of time around other people can spot Code, AdG, etc. But for example, I love most of what Polo offers (it's cheap and dept store but I don't care, it smells great) until I get it on my skin. Without fail, every Polo fragrance develops a ""rotting basil"" note on my skin, within 10 minutes. It doesn't happen with other frags that have those notes, so it must be some ingredient/formulation that is unique to Polo.",best cologne
