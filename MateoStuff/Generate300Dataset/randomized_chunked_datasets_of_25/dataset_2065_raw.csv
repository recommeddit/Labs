"The Rock. At thirteen, my youngest daughter was gravely ill and while in hospital she wanted to watch only two things on television (she pretty much slept the remaining portion of her six month stay) - Emeril Lagasse and WWF. During her recovery, the WWF came to town and I secured back stage passes. Most of the wrestlers we met were very nice, Chris Jericho in particular. But the Rock was the big name of the day and when we met him, I wasn't sure what to expect. He was kind and gracious, speaking to my daughter for as long as she liked, and he posed for as many pictures as we wished. He struck me as being a very sincere and genuine kind of guy."
"Pilot hi tec-c pens are great for fine line sketching and have a surprising range of line weight. The ink isn't waterproof, but sometimes that's a good thing. I prefer them over the microns, which are more fragile and less versatile IMHO. Happy sketchin!"

Must be the second best idea he's ever had
"Iâ€™m reading Dune for the first time right now. Really, really good."
"Better lpt: use only hard-sided luggage with no zippers, and don't use TSA padlocks. If you're going to be checking something valuable, put it in a hard-shell pelican case or similar and get good padlocks"
I was not prepared at all for WS after The First Avenger. Left that movie with my jaw on the floor.
"yooo gami gang under not hip-hop, those guys are absolute saints! spirit of the beehive is crazy good too"
There is quite a few places petrinis Rusty's Giovanni's Taffy's etc
"Not going to lie, I can see myself doing that too."

I think I understand how DSS works. Just wondering about some of the specifics. Namely why band 5 status is always shown as lte for me and if band 5 corresponds to a specific nr band (thinking maybe it's because my phone doesn't have that nr band).
"My favourite local breakfast food is nasi lemak.

Coconut rice with fried chicken, a small fried fish, spam, otah (spicy fish sticks), and an egg. All topped with lashings of sambal chili sauce and peanuts. A bit rich for every day, but absolutely delicious!"

"Not really. Artists will make things about the places they live. It's human nature. It's the same with any big city- London, Paris, LA, Tokyo. It has nothing to do with New York as a place of artificially inflated interest. It simply comes down to the fact that a lot of people who make art live in New York. And naturally, much of that is inspired by the city itself."
"Bloody Mary, mushroom toast and a cigg."
"A Canticle for Liebowitz,  Ender's Game, The Forever War, Old Man's War, Ingathering, the Book of the People, Foundation,  Dune, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,  the Martian Chronicles."
"50% for GPU? That'll make the rest of the parts much inferior than the GPU.

Bruh, 30-40% for a GPU is ideal. The rest should go for everything else.

And when someone says ""budget"" build, remember this: ""Every single dollar that can be saved will be saved."" Suggesting him to wait for a 3070 is a wrong call cus by the time it'll be available for purchase, it'll already be out of stock (sad reality). And none of the cards rn are going to be obsolete anytime soon. There are people who still use the Pascal Nvidia GPUs till date without feeling left out as ""obsolete"""
