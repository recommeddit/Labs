30643,best Mexican war to study,">US Revolution - debateable

Freeing yourself from a government is never debatable, it is man's right. It was the institution of a new government where this went off the rails. 

>Civil War - tough one

Should never have happened. Persons have the right to freely associate and disassociate. The breaking of voluntary political ties does not justify aggression in response no matter how strong a persons' selfish desire to ""maintain unity"" or other rubbish. 

>World War I - justified

Europe's problem. Not our fault they had all these entanglements.

>World War II - Justified

Would never have happened without food, fuel, and cash from America. We could have stopped Germany without a single shot fired by simply not supporting Germany economically. 

>Afghanistan - this one is tough for me. I understand the anger of wanting osama and the afghan refusing to turn him over. But was there another way?

1. The Taliban ***tried to give us Osama***. We refused. 
2. Not our nation, not our people, not our territory, not our problem.
3. Osama has *never* been implicated in the 9/11 attacks.

The message you should take from my response is that war is ***never*** justified. The person who tells you it is, has something to gain."

32625,best vacation resort,"Have you considered going on a cruise. That would be an ""All-inclusive"" vacation personified. Your fare includes your stateroom, all the food you could possibly eat, entertainment, and travel to your destination. You are required to pay for any cocktails, beer and soda you order, and there is plenty of shopping on board that could bring the tab up, but you can usually be careful and get away with a pretty budget-minded trip. If You are thinking about Cabo, they have a 7 day trip out of Los Angeles that does one day in Puerto Vallarta, and two days in Cabo san Lucas.

Last thing I will add is, make sure to spring the extra couple dollars for the Balcony staterooms. They are not too much more than the other rooms, but absolutely make all the difference in your experience.

48489,best color to paint with,"> Iâ€™m not sure painting will make any difference with the smell, but itâ€™ll help with the overall vibe.

definitely... I didn't mind the colors that the house had before we bought it, but painting everything fresh and new really helped it feel like ours instead of an AirBNB rental."
26227,best politician,"Love her grit, toughness, and determination. Her public service is to be really admired. She's really accomplished a lot and it's clear that every single step of the way has been an uphill battle, yet she forges on."
63950,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"I use pocketcast. It allows to fast forward, rewind etc easily just like a pod episode."
56053,best action and adventure movie,"I liked the characters we were introduced to and the ghost pirates. 

Honestly the sequels started to get confusing, with characters seemingly betraying each other. I liked how Davy Jones looked, but wasn't the biggest fan of the character itself.

The score for CotBP is great, the only one I think is better would be At World's End."

31839,best hotel to live in,"That was 2 years ago and around $100 a night. I donâ€™t remember for sure. This year staying at FourQueens and it was $121 Canadian a night. But it literally jumped 70$ a night 12 hours after we booked.

If you donâ€™t mind Uber/lyfting. Stratosphere is dirt cheap."
33309,best electric car,The cable/j1772 connector are one piece on the fiat. The only way to replace the connector is to replace the cable which attaches to the top of the battery. The battery has to be pulled to access it. There's no way around it.

33222,best electric car,"The only place that would suck is if you live in/travel through the northern central-ish states like Montana, Wyoming, N/S Dakota where superchargers are more common, and you won't be screwed if the ONE CCS plug that is supposed to be working, isn't.

The massive supercharger station at West Yellowstone was a masterstroke..."
