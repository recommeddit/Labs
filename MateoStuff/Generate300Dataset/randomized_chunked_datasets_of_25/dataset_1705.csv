As far as hardware store, outside of choosing one over another because they carry different items, I choose on a store by store basis. Im three years deep into home ownership and I found that I the HD or Lowe's stores take on the personality of the GM. One Home Depot might have their shit together and hire employees that care and are helpful, might have great clearances prices and good stock while simultaneously another HD down the road is a compete shitshow. Same applies to Lowes.  Good luck. Oh and avoid their Credit Cards or at least avoid their inflated APR on their cards.",best home improvement store

38266,"As I wrote, I agree that The Economist offers some of the best journalism out there. Their [explanatory articles](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains), especially, are the most consistently well researched pieces of journalism you can find.

However, when it comes to politics and economics, The Economist is extremely focused on using deregulation to both explain the origin of and suggest solutions to the issues they cover. I hence used the word ""bias"" in the [1a sense of the Macmillan dictionary definition.](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/bias_1)

In the more traditional sense of the word, The Economist is often very one-sided in its reporting on contention. An example: I am currently writing my thesis on the recent secessionist movements in Catalonia and Scotland. After reading every piece the Economist have published about these topics since 2007, I have found that the Economist offers excellent analyses and compelling arguments and explanations. Namely that the secessionists are populists driven by greed, which is certainly true to some extent. However the Economist also unfailingly ignore other equally valid arguments and narratives. More specifically the secessionists are also driven by a widespread and partly justified disillusionment with their national governments after decades of neglect and marginalisation caused by their status as peripheral, minority regions.

The great thing about The Economist is that it's not just straight news reporting. The Economist offers explanations, analyses and even policy suggestions to the issues they cover. However, due limited space and a [relatively strict editorial stance](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ksbjm/i_am_a_correspondent_for_the_economist_covering/clocfu7) their reporting and analyses tends to be biased and one-sided; and must often be supplemented with other sources.

This can to a certain extent be said about most news. Just what a news source chooses to cover and how they frame it, can be said to constitute a bias. However, due to the admirable ambitions of The Economist, I'd argue that it is even more pronounced with them.

Also, as a non-american who is mostly interested in US federal politics, I don't think I should recommend news sources for Americans.",best newspapers to read

It's yet another example of traditional media being angry about their revenues and control being eaten up by Facebook and Google ads and trying to lash back. 

As for social media use etc, in my personal experience, I used to be addicted to social media because my life sucked and I couldn't relate to anyone IRL. In another generation I might have killed myself, but I was happy finding kindred spirits online. If young people are using social media a lot, figure out what you're not providing for them in real life. You don't allow you people to go out to places, they spend all their evenings at classes or homework, and they have little to no control over their own lives or places to socialize. So of course they are going to be online a lot because that's where their socializing is happening. They don't go on Facebook no matter how addicting it is, because their friends aren't there. They go to the network their friends are on. They just want to be around their friends. 

As for the rest of us, we can get addicted to anything. I don't see documentaries with bartenders talking about quitting their jobs because of the ethics, and alcohol use has much worse effects than social media. 

As for ads, I've worked on targeted ads. I didn't enjoy it and I quit to work on e-commerce because it's so much more tangible as an area of specialization. The information collected for targeted ads seems like a lot but each person's data is useless in isolation without network effects. Also all that data doesn't really help you make accurate predictions on people because you only collect data that's a small snapshot of their lives, and also people aren't as predictable as we'd like them to be. 

My bigger worry is really government agencies getting access to data collected by tech companies through extremely unregulated means. For that, I silo every social network on a separate browser on my phone. 

I don't believe in deleting social media. I have accounts on several sites. I just restrict how often I go on them. Will I spent five hours a  day at Starbucks? If not, why will I spend that long on Twitter? I check my email once a month for unimportant emails, and Facebook once a week. I check Twitter daily but that's because I'm promoting my side gig on there. If anything, I'm glad for social media because I don't have to spend tons of money trying to place ads or do publicity stunts. Five tweets a day is all I need, and I can schedule them all ahead of time. 

This documentary is a bunch of fearmongering that'll get taken seriously by a lot of people. I don't have anything more to say.",best social networking site for CS
