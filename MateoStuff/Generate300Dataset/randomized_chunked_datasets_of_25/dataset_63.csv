47440,best state to visit in the United States,"Where are you coming from? If you're from California DO NOT DO IT!!!

They will hate you massively."
28365,best breakfast foods,"1/2 cup quick 1 minute Quaker oats + 1 tablespoon of peanut butter some water and a microwave. Maybe I'm weird but I can eat this for breakfast every single day. 

It keeps me full and energetic until lunch. Great mix of carbs/protein/fats. 

Very quick and easy (prep time about one minute).

 Last but not least CHEAP. Cheap cheap CHEAP cheap Get a BOGO(yer god damn right.) on your peanut butter and you're looking at all of 10 dollars for a month of breakfasts.

And if you need some extra protein toss a scoop of chocolate whey or casin protein in there too. 

I even coined a term for it. ""Soylent Brown"". Tastes as good as it sounds."
36121,best alcoholic drink,"A whiskey and bacon bar in Brooklyn? God, that must be the hipster equivalent of DisneyWorld."
27054,best board games,Can I make a small suggestion of just a condensed list of titles at the end? I know most of these games so scrolling through the descriptions and details is a little laborious to me. I'd rather see the list and then go find a particular outlier and see who voted how. Unless I missed that?

32488,best vacation resort,"bingo, even if they are fake, if they all repeat one glaring issue, that could be a huge blessing in disguise."
32041,best hotel to live in,"Probably a once and a lifetime opportunity, I was invited on a trip by a female friend to the Caribbean and this little resort called Anse Chastanet, you can only get to it via helicopter or sea plane as the roads are awful. I'm used to hotels like best western which are normal, but this place was super posh. I think the best part was how peaceful it was, it was so removed from busy society, also the fact that I didn't have to pay for it as my friend had pretty much begged me to come, and is pretty loaded.

I highly doubt ill be able to go to another place that posh again with my own finances."
31942,best hotel to live in,"So you're saying that with Ritz Carlton card you hit 10k spend, which equals gold = 50 nights.  Then the Marriott Card adds 15 nights, so 65 elite qualifying nights.

32318,best hotel to live in,"Was at a bubba gumps somewhere with a whole lot of drunken bastards.  I was on DD duty so was the sober interpreter for the evening.  

Bubba Gumps has these signs on the table that say run Forrest run.  And stop Forrest stop or something similar.  If you have run the wait staff leave you alone.  If you have stop the check what you need.  There were a lot of very attractive waitresses and the drunk bastards decided when they saw each to flip the sign to stop.  

One comes by.  And stop sign goes up.  “What would you like.”   “Butter please “.  She brings back butter.  

Another comes by.  Stop sign.  “What you need”.  “Butter please “.  

And again, and again.  

I am laughing my ass off each time as none of these guys realizes that they keep asking for the same thing.  

Eventually one comes to the stop sign and asks “what do you need?”   “Butter please”. 

She looks at me.  Looks at the table.  Looks at them.  And back at me.  I shake my head in apology. 

She proceeds to count little containers of butter already sitting on the table.  Slowly and loudly.  “One, two, three, four, …., all the way to seventeen.”   All completely full and untouched.  

“And you need more butter?”   

Drunkest guy mutters “yes please!”   

She shakes her head and walks off.   

And that is how I witnessed a table full of drunks being cut off of butter but not booze."

56474,best desktop monitor,"You will get spoiled, that is it"
35563,best alcoholic drink,"This was my gateway drink into proper whiskey and I'll always appreciate it. Started out more ginger and less whiskey, then eventually, ginger on the side, no ice. Then just Jameson. Then moved onto, ""Jameson? That's for plebes. Give me a Bushmills Black at *least*.""

And on and on until you're paying $60-$80 for a bottle of 12 year old single malt and find yourself thinking, ""this is *okay* but I bet the 18 year is the shit."" Hopefully by the time that rolls around you've got the job to pay for it."
