BluBlocker Havana aviators. I grew up on blue blocker commercials and I would get them in dollar stores for $19.99. Cue to a movie called the Hangover and now they are a luxury eyewear brand. Either way the blue spectrum blocking makes these great glasses to wear outside or even indoors.

17131,"There are two versions: 

**FM Mobile:** Very, very streamlined and restrictive version of FM. If you like the PC version, this one might serve as a quick fix but that’s it. 

**FM Touch:** This one is ALMOST like the PC version in every aspect. You get the same interface, deep strategy customization, booking, finances, different departments to take care of, different modes and unlocks and you get the 3D match view. The missing stuff is actually welcomed. Long gone are the tedious bits of the full fledged version which imho, just added random frustration, like the press conferences, team scoldings and those conversations where you need to babysit and fix everyone’s problems. This version is actually sold on PC too and a lot of people prefer it over the regular one because it’s more like the old FMs.",best iOS game
