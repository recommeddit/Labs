34166,best NFL player,"I love WP. Love. 

But to say he could play any position? Defensive tackle? Quarterback? Punter? Place kicker? Center? Defensive back?

It's like I'm 12 again and arguing with my dumb little brothers. 

Yes he could.

No he couldn't.

Uh-huh.

Nuh-uh."

48198,best color to paint with,"Huh, never heard of that.  After a conversation with the guys at the shop, I came away with the impression that they just mixed up a quart of normal paint in eggshell or something, then divided it out into the little bottles.  They wouldn't do samples for any color that was so pale that it couldn't be mixed up as a quart."
25979,best cricket teams of all time,"Less obvious for England, perhaps than for Australia or England, but I'm now searching through the 20s lineups.  Top five of Hobbs (avge 56.9) Sutcliffe (60.7) Hammond (58.5) Jardine (48.0) Hendren (47.6) as seen [in Sydney 1928](http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17596/scorecard/62563/australia-vs-england-2nd-test-england-tour-of-australia-1928-29) seems to be a little let down by bowling attacks.

Edit: Obvs I meant than Australia and the West Indies"

24314,best anime,"When I compile the ""top 100 most acclaimed anime tits & feet"", I'll be sure to use your list. :)"
11250,best gifts for dad,"They make these portable hiking hammocks that are like $60 at places like REI. They're bad ass. I borrowed one once, and slept outside in the woods in like 39 degree F weather. Just a sleeping bag and the hammock. Being elevated off the ground really keeps you much warmer. It seems to be made out of the same shit parachutes are, cords and all. I forget the name of them, but surely some handy outdoors(wo)man can expand on my drunk thoughts."
37133,best amusement park,I think we'll all agree that both parks are mandatory to visit on relatively equal footing.
15682,best sunglasses for fashion,"Speaking of Luxoticca, I came across this thread and thought that it would be helpful for consumers looking to support brands other than that monopoly.

66445,best soccer team in the world,We did beat you! :)
67719,axios alternatives reddit,This is a huge problem
55732,best action and adventure novel series,"I think it matches everything you listed above for sure.  The first book is great, but I feel that 3-4 is where it takes off.  8-10 are a notorious slog, but the pay off is amazing.  The series essentially spends so long building up to the final battle, that the last book is pretty much just that battle.  Again, I'd recommend it highly!"
44932,best items under $100,I agree! My headlamp made it possible to clip my babies nails while she was sleeping (a near impossible task during the day).
56599,best desktop monitor,It's all good I forgive you.
