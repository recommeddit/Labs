50770,best rap album,"Some of my favorites so far: 

Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine- BROCKHAMPTON

I TAPE- VIC MENSA

Pray for Haiti- Mach-Hommy

The Off Season- J Cole

I know nothing here is particularly unknown and it’s all pretty popular- still really looking forward to the second half of this year!"
27119,best board games,"Personally, I love TM's art. It feels very scientific journal-y to me."
35698,best alcoholic drink,"HEY EVERYBODY, HUGE ALCOHOL PARTY AT THE GOAT HOUSE!!!"
40154,best midrange CPU,"They are the same chip, the 2600X just has a higher base and boost clock.  

At stock speeds there is about a 6% difference, and overclocked they are both identical, so I would never recommend spending $60 more for the X version."

23745,best car racing video game,"Dirt 3, Sonic Racing Transformed, and Test Drive Unlimited 2 (years ago... I'd probably like Horizon 3 more now from the same angles I enjoyed TDU2 from, but it's Win 10 + Windows Store exclusive so I've yet to play it)."

34824,best NFL player,"Ehh. He won DPOY, dude. Was it as good as his 2018 season? No. But that’s because ‘18 was the single greatest season ever put together by a DT. I don’t think you can call 15.5 sacks a down year."
47573,best state to visit in the United States,I camped in Canyonlands National Park and I completely agree with you. It was just stunning.
11718,best gifts for dad,"That was a giftcard, and I wrote: You’re the best, Dad. I love you!"
43353,best ad service for mobile applications,How do you handle GDPR when using mediation with Facebook Audience Network?
73115,best Linux distro,"I'm very, very new to Linux. My experiences with it (i.e. Linux as a platform) so far are some Knoppix and Kali Linux, both as live versions to restore/save files from friends’ bricked PCs that they didn’t back up.

I installed Manjaro on a former Windows machine that, under Windows, wouldn’t even shut down and restart properly anymore. Updates would fail, because the laptop crashed on trying to shut down. Manjaro revived that thing and it’s working beautifully. I find myself enjoying it a lot, even as a newbie. Whenever something doesn’t work (right away), you will usually find a solution or you can ask the community for help. Since it’s based on Arch, there’s also a ton of documentations and a nice wiki.

One question I couldn’t really find an answer to yet, however: What are the real differences between Manjaro and Arch? I asked two Arch users from a chat I often visit and their answer was … not helpful, to put it mildly."
3906,best online college,"It is harder. That's the thing people who didnt go to a 4 year college don't get. It takes 4 years out of your life where you can do nothing but school. That's why 4 year colleges are held in higher regard because the people that attended them sacrificed working for four years to get the degree. 

College was never meant to be something to do in conjunction with work. College was meant to be something where you went to learn skills to work. It was never a given. It required legitimate sacrifice of your life to obtain a degree and that's why the people who hold regular 4 year degrees observe online ones that way. 

Imagine being flat broke and only able to work 15 hours a week for four years and doing nothing but school."
55605,best action and adventure novel series,The riftwar saga by raymond e feist is pretty good if a little predictable.

Tenchi muyo!
Trigun
Scryed
Full metal panic! 
Soul eater"
14789,best romantic novel,"I cannot wait!  I’m assuming you received an ARC, and I couldn’t be more envious.  Beach Read was truly one of my favorite books in the last decade, and Emily Henry is just a DELIGHT on Instagram."
21975,best celebrity,"Yes, nothing makes me happier than to know John Barrowman is an actual nice guy. I desperately want to be that guy’s friend."
64263,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"If you find IRC/mIRC too complicated to use, you might be interested in [Rusty Book Pirate](https://github.com/aghayes/rusty_book_pirate/) or [OpenBooks](https://github.com/evan-buss/openbooks) (I recommend OpenBooks).

They're GUI projects that let you easily download books from IRC."
29549,best game console,"Understandable.  Though, I will say an Xbox 360 can be bought on eBay for as low as $60 these days, and since a lot of people are going to want to transition to Xbox One since the costs were brought down to $349, an influx of sellers are BOUND to come in soon, and perhaps we can get consoles at even lower prices if were lucky because of it!"
9379,best toothpaste,"No he's paid off but he's just lazy, wooooo free moneyyyy"
2545,best headphones,"Yeah, not really a fan of in-ear or -on ear. They're just not comfortable. And thanks for the suggestion!"
