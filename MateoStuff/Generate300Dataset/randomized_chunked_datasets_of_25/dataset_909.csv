73115,"I'm very, very new to Linux. My experiences with it (i.e. Linux as a platform) so far are some Knoppix and Kali Linux, both as live versions to restore/save files from friends’ bricked PCs that they didn’t back up.

I installed Manjaro on a former Windows machine that, under Windows, wouldn’t even shut down and restart properly anymore. Updates would fail, because the laptop crashed on trying to shut down. Manjaro revived that thing and it’s working beautifully. I find myself enjoying it a lot, even as a newbie. Whenever something doesn’t work (right away), you will usually find a solution or you can ask the community for help. Since it’s based on Arch, there’s also a ton of documentations and a nice wiki.

One question I couldn’t really find an answer to yet, however: What are the real differences between Manjaro and Arch? I asked two Arch users from a chat I often visit and their answer was … not helpful, to put it mildly.",best Linux distro
3906,"It is harder. That's the thing people who didnt go to a 4 year college don't get. It takes 4 years out of your life where you can do nothing but school. That's why 4 year colleges are held in higher regard because the people that attended them sacrificed working for four years to get the degree. 

College was never meant to be something to do in conjunction with work. College was meant to be something where you went to learn skills to work. It was never a given. It required legitimate sacrifice of your life to obtain a degree and that's why the people who hold regular 4 year degrees observe online ones that way. 

Imagine being flat broke and only able to work 15 hours a week for four years and doing nothing but school.",best online college

Though, I will say an Xbox 360 can be bought on eBay for as low as $60 these days, and since a lot of people are going to want to transition to Xbox One since the costs were brought down to $349, an influx of sellers are BOUND to come in soon, and perhaps we can get consoles at even lower prices if were lucky because of it!",best game console
