30726,"I certainly don't think you're wrong but I think that these rankings shouldn't be only thing people consider. For example taking into account average life expectancy, education, you are taking averages which can be skewed by outliers. Take example in America, more people are obese which largely contributes to life expectancy. But statistics are just that, generalizations. It doesn't dictate your own life. If you want to be healthy, you can be healthy. Education is the same. American k-12 schools are not as highly ranked as other countries, but it certainly doesn't mean that students are incapable of doing very well academically, and can't excel in American Colleges which are generally very high ranking. I'm not trying to say these global rankings and standards like public schooling, violence, standard of living, etc are wrong or insignificant, but they aren't like rigid truths. America is an extremely diverse country that is just huge, which makes it a harder to manage and budget properly than a place like Japan which is ranked very highly in a lot of these standards. This isn't an excuse for slack, but more so and indicator of outliers that drastically skew the rankings and data of things like education quality and income inequality. Take example the average salary in America. Around 30-50k. By no means is that a ceiling you are limited to. Just a few examples.

16494,"I've recently gotten more into sunglasses, but I'm no where near as knowledgeable as some of the other posters in the thread. Anyways, I still wanted to share my experience in case it might be helpful! At the moment, I have three pairs of sunglasses that I wear in heavy rotation:

1. A polarized pair I mainly use for driving. Seriously, polarized sunglasses will change your life. This is the pair that I spent the most on ($100+), and they are a classic wayfarer shape. Some brands I like are Smith (I have these), Maui Jim, and Cole Haan. Ray-Bans are ok, but not worth it for the price if IMO. Polaroid and SunCloud also have some really affordable polarized options.

2. A ""fashion"" pair, that I spent the second most on (~$70). I uses these for walking around, hanging out with friends, traveling, etc. Essentially situations where I need sunglasses but will not be driving, and will have little opportunity to lose them. I get a ""fashion"" style with these. My current pair is a jet-black over-sized cat eye silhouette from Le Spec, my personal favorite sunglasses brand. Quay is also a fun brand. 

3. Cheap pair. Spent no more than $10 on them, mainly get them from fast fashion stores. I use these for when I'm doing a high-action activity (hiking, boating, theme parks) and have a high potential of losing them. I get these in a classic silhouette (current pair is a wayfarer), and I found my pair at Forever 21 for $6.


For the more expensive pairs, I would recommend either getting them directly from the brand if you can, in order to qualify for the warranty, or a retailer with an awesome return policy (in the US), like Nordstrom or Zappos. I get my fast fashion ones from places like ASOS. Discount department stores like Nordstrom Rack and Off 5th also have great quality options at good prices. I've seen polarized Cole Haan sunglasses for $35 at the rack, and $75 Ray-Bans at Off 5th.",best sunglasses for fashion

But to be fair I must also add that the Spirit Pro has one of the most unique looks of any headphone I have seen, with the spackled paint finish that looks remarkably like [the headphones are wet] (http://medias.audiofanzine.com/images/normal/719797.jpg).
