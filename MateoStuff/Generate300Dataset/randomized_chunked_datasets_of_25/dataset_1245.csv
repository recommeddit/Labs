14505,best romantic novel,If you loved Lover Awakened you’ll enjoy Demon from the Dark. Zsadist and Malkom have very similar back stories. Demon From the Dark is #9 in the Immortals After Dark series but I read it as a stand-alone and had no problem.
6994,best iPhone,"OLED and eye strain greatly depends on the PWM controller. This year’s iPhone Pro models have a better controller than the XS models, which already were like three solid generations ahead of top end Android flagships of today (Note 10 is eye strain hell).

I’d be surprised if a fucking Xiaomi had a better PWM controller than a Note 10, and that already has an atrocious controller

I’ve had my Pro Max for more than a month now and whenever I look at a Note 10 my eyes instantly hurt, it’s safe to say you’re comparing lobster thermidor to a five year old mcdonald’s hamburger"

44930,best items under $100,"A *good* flashlight. The tl;dr here is that you need one more than you think, it’s one of the most useful things you can own, and maglites and plastic crap are not even close in capability to what you can get these days.

Many of you have probably seen the feds recommending owning a dedicated flashlight- not the one in your phone. Which is absolutely good advice, because in the event you need a flashlight to see there’s a good chance you’re in a situation where you are not going to be able to charge your phone, and will have better uses for your phone battery.

And a lot of you are probably thinking “yeah no worries I have that plastic flashlight laying around here somewhere” or “oh yeah my dad’s old maglite is in the garage.”  Guys, I love to break it to you, but the flashlight you have is probably terrible compared to proper modern flashlights.  

And no, I don’t mean the ones you get in the sporting goods section of WalMart- although some of those are reasonably okay, they’re almost universally overpriced for what they are. And I sure don’t mean this US MILITARY HIGH POWER EXTREME BEST FLASHLIGHT IN THE WORLD marketing traps you see on TV ads and kickstarters.

Nowadays you can get incredible flashlights that will light up your house better than your actual overhead lights, turn nighttime off in a 50 yard radius of you outside, or even fire a beam of light across a field or lake a mile away.  For less than $100 bucks. Hell, in many cases, less than $50.

Now obviously I recommend heading over to r/flashlight if you want to do some research- although fair warning, you might catch the flashlight collecting bug and there’s no coming back from that. But if you want my personal recommendation for some to check out-

The Sofirn SP36 is about the size of a soda can, and can put out about 100 times as much light as the flashlight on your phone in a big floody way that fills up rooms easily. Hovers around $60 on Amazon.

The Astrolux FT03: this is about as typical looking a flashlight as you can imagine, but the standard model can put out about 50 times as much light as your phone and will blast it out over 800 meters. About $35 if you’re willing to sit around and wait for it to come from China in a couple weeks.

The Lumentop EDC18 is a pocket sized flashlight about the size of your thumb that can do over 50 times as much light as your phone. If you don’t want a fancy user interface, go for the EDC18L. $50, or as little as $30 with a coupon on Amazon.

Anything from Olight, Sofirn, Convoy, Emisar, Noctigon, Nitecore, Wowtac, Thrunite, Surefire, Fenix, or Zebralight is going to blow your mind if you’ve not used a real modern flashlight before and will be probably be more than enough for a normal non flashlight fetishist. There are plenty of other companies I’ve forgotten to put in there I’m sure but I’ll personally vouch for all of those.

EDIT: okay phew I wasn’t expecting this to… do what it did, but thanks everyone for making me feel less like a weird flashlight pervert, or at least feel good about it. Especially thanks for the rewards, that’s pretty neat. I think I’ve responded to everyone who responded so I’m gonna snuff out the Emisar D4V2 gently flickering in candle mode beside me and hit the hay."

12421,best gifts for mom,"My brother's and my plan for this Christmas: a Publix gift card specially designated so my mom can buy fresh flowers each week from New Year's to Mother's Day ($10 a week or so). Then another for Mother's Day to last through most of the summer. She has enough more than enough ""stuff"" (I helped pack it when she moved this year) and doesn't want more, but she loves fresh flowers. She feels guilty spending money on them, even though the bouquets at the supermarket aren't that expensive. So I figure this is the perfect gift!"
