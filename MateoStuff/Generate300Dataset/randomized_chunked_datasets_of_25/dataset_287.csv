46325,best trick or treating candy,"- 1 to 2 pieces per kid is sufficient. Usually give two if they're really small, like tootsie rolls. 
 - Don't let older kids pick from a bowl. They mill around looking for a specific piece. It's annoying if you have a shit ton of kids. 
 - I'd think 250 is enough. I usually end up buying too much and start giving kids more towards the end of the night. 
 - Just turn your light on. No need to dress up or anything. 
 - 5-7 or 8 is fine. I usually wait till it started dying down or I run out of candy, which seems to be between  7 and 8. 
 - Don't worry about anyone doing anything to your house. Doesn't really happen. 

Watch out for older kids. Those bastards will come back to your house multiple times, they linger around later hoping to get more candy, and they're pushy."

6730,best iPhone,Definitely. Been on the X since launch and it’s going strong. If the 12 doesn’t wow me too much I may hang on to it for one more year.
31935,best hotel to live in,"I'm a fan and seek out SPG properties when I travel. That said, the Aloft in Overland Park, Kansas had terribly uncomfortable beds and for that reason I won't stay there again. Bummer because it was otherwise a great stay, but not worth the trouble if you can't sleep."
73134,best Linux distro,"Best depends on the consumer. Maybe you mean least effort for someone transitioning from \_\_\_\_?  Does the OP want rolling release, server like, etc? I've never seen someone that used Manjaro long term and liked it. -Most of us switched to Arch and are happy there."
9431,best toothpaste,"Just like with water, the brush spins toward the Equador.  It's all Reddit Science."
60216,best freezer brand,">You also need to manually defrost it maybe once or twice a year

That seems way more often than I find I need to defrost mine. Might depend on multiple factors."
29419,best game console,Damn them for escort/protection missions.  Take those out and you could crank out new versions of that game every year CoD-style and I'd eat them up like candy.
67353,axios alternatives reddit,Axios supports Node and Browser based runtimes out of the gate. You'd need two libraries to do the same thing with `ky` and `got`.

4032,best online college,That sounds really interesting.
53269,best usb c charging cable,After some time now I have realized I made some mistakes with how I handled the chargers but the main issue is actually with my charging port. For whatever reason a charger won't make a good connection with my phone where it might for others.
50532,best rap album,"I have hardly ever seen anything by Common mentioned on this sub except for Be and his verse about a remote.

Common is the shit. Although I feel like everything before Be is better than everything after Be, which is probably why he doesn't get too much recognition."

28224,best breakfast foods,Vegemite on buttered toast with sharp cheddar and very thinly sliced dill pickle.
11048,best backpack for college,"I live in Oregon.
Lots of people have the small one that's a little square with the logo in red and white. That's pretty much everywhere from Asia to Europe to America.

I have the big one. In my campus I've never seen someone with the same color, though I've seen two others with the same backpack. So I don't think mines basic or that common or over rated. Like I said, I've put it through the ringer. And it keeps my stuff dry even though it pours all the time here."
32280,best hotel to live in,"At a certain Beverly Hills hotel, where I valet’d for a short amount of time, many stars cars are just left there. They come and get them whenever. There was also a code name for Justin Bieber who visited often (I can’t remember it). He picked it himself. His G-Wagon and a Bentley were just kept down there free of charge. Usher also left his bike there a few years back and has just never collected it."
