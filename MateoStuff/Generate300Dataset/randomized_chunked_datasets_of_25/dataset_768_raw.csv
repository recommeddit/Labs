"I like how violinist was basically just ""Do you want to spend years of your life in complete torture because everybody is better than you?"""
"I'm reading *War and Peace* right now. Really interesting look at those wars. Tolstoy makes them seem so inevitable, yet so pointless."
"Maybe not greatest, but it's definitely up there."
This guy cases.
"u/AwkwardShake thank you so much, I will check it out"
JB3 getting the respect he deserves! Great write-up /u/sanswagata
Is that a brand that won’t mess up the pins in the charging port?  I just found out yesterday at the apple store about how the pins can get messed up from certain lightning connectors.  I’m currently dealing with a loose charging port that doesn’t get a “click” anymore when inserting a lightning cable…

Clan of The Cave Bear series by Jean Auel! The erotica starts in the second book. They're big books that have lots of details about survival and caveman life. I adore them.
"Alright, maybe I need to edit my post, I am not completely against the idea, I have heard of friends who make their dogs peed on pad so thought that was a ""normal"" practice for small dogs.

"Yes, they are sweet kids. The irony is that I raised them with very little. They are so sweet, humble, giving and loving. My step kids have been raised with every luxury and never wanted for anything and the difference is palpable. It's all good- I'm very excited for ALL of their futures because I know that even if I don't always get acknowledged, I still had a hand in it."
"Why though? I used to get tonsil stones, adjusted my habits and they went. It was due to an increased salt intake. Once I decreased that they stopped. Went to the doctor initially about them and saw a dentist from the NHS who said to get my tonsils removed. Went to my private dentist and he told me how to sort it out"
"Rice, eggs and Spam."
Holy shit are you me?! Those two songs were the first I heard by DOOM and now he's one of my favorite rappers.
