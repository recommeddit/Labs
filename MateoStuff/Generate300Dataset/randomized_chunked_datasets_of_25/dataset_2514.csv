51867,best iphone case,"When it comes to protective cases I always have peace of mind when I buy the Defender series to protect my phone. Especially when you pair it with a glass screen protector. I’m rocking the Defender Pro on my Xr which I love as it seems more rugged than your typical Defender case and it covers up the Apple logo.

71876,best movies with a cool twist,"The movie made it look so damn obvious that Zepp was going to be the killer.  Like, when he showed up I was like ""Yeah, that's the killer right there"".  Then the rest of the film happens, yeah it turned out Zepp locked and chained them up in that bathroom, then out of nowhere Adam finds his tape recorder and mind blown.

I literally sat there staring at the credits (and listening to Adam's howling) with my eyes wide open and jaw open."
16599,best pet for toddlers,"Has your husband tried allergy meds? A kitten would be great- low maintenance but fun, cute and high energy. Otherwise I’d say get a small dog, they basically like cats and dont need tons of space."
16529,best pet for toddlers,"You could get a older dog that is a calm breed that would likely be okay alone 8-5, as long as you invest some good play and active time when you are around. Puppies obviously won't work... look for a dog who is 1 1/2 to 3 years old. Also this won't be a pet for the toddler, this will be your pet. The child is not going to do anything for this pet but possibly annoy it, and play with a bit, but most kids get bored of that fairly quickly.  Also remember that a dog can be a 15 year investment, it isn't something that is a small commitment. Perhaps a older cat?"
16776,best pet for toddlers,"Golden retrievers too. We had a lot of kids in and out of the house. They would play airplane with his ears, sit on him, play, etc. dude just took it and actually enjoyed it. He loved being around kids. We got him early 2000s before we really had internet and he was from a BYB. Risky for sure but it’s nice looking back now that the golden retriever nice behavior still shone through"

18179,best YouTube video,"This: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw

""Hidden Human History""

It's the most batshit-insane conspiracy video I've ever seen. Most conspiracy videos start strong, have 5 minutes of insanity, and then level off as they try to explain the 5 minutes. This one just keeps going.

It's got everything from atlantis, to lucifer on mars, to hebrews being aliens, to the star of david being a space warship on the sea floor piloted telepathically by a woman from central america."
