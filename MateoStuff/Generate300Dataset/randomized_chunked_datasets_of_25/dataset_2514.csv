51867,"When it comes to protective cases I always have peace of mind when I buy the Defender series to protect my phone. Especially when you pair it with a glass screen protector. I’m rocking the Defender Pro on my Xr which I love as it seems more rugged than your typical Defender case and it covers up the Apple logo.

Then the rest of the film happens, yeah it turned out Zepp locked and chained them up in that bathroom, then out of nowhere Adam finds his tape recorder and mind blown.

16529,"You could get a older dog that is a calm breed that would likely be okay alone 8-5, as long as you invest some good play and active time when you are around. Puppies obviously won't work... look for a dog who is 1 1/2 to 3 years old. Also this won't be a pet for the toddler, this will be your pet. The child is not going to do anything for this pet but possibly annoy it, and play with a bit, but most kids get bored of that fairly quickly.  Also remember that a dog can be a 15 year investment, it isn't something that is a small commitment. Perhaps a older cat?",best pet for toddlers
