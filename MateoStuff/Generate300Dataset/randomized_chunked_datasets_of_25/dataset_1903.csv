35637,best alcoholic drink,"Sailor Jerry's and cherry coke. 

Also tried Sailor Jerry's and orange juice while high. Called it sp'O-J (pronounced spo-jay; ""sp"" = abbreviation for ""spiced""). 

Can't verify that it's good other than it tasted like a Floridian Christmas."
5860,best programming language for web development,Most people do front end then back end. Though if you are already familiar with or interested in a backend language you can do it the other way around. Also [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is worth checking out.

33342,best electric car,"If you wanted to go the cheap route, your daily commute would be easily covered by an used, older Leaf or another 'last-gen' EV like the Soul EV, Focus Electric, etc. but road trips would be rather difficult.

New, the Leaf or the MINI SE are both under $20k with state/fed incentives, but aren't great for long trips with their short ranges (and the Leaf's ChaDeMo).    
VW's ID.4 is a also pretty good deal with a 260mi range and a good amount of space for around $31k after incentives."

53089,best hiphop album,"Yeah completely agree, I really love Heavy Metal but didn’t think any of their other songs came close to it. Hope they can match that level on their next project"
56612,best desktop monitor,"I'm already at 1440p 90Hz IPS, but itching for an upgrade. I really want a 3440x1440 120Hz+ IPS G-sync, but can't justify the current cost of them. How big of an upgrade would going from 90Hz to 120Hz+ and getting G-sync and probably a higher quality panel in general be? (I currently have a very cheap Korean monitor from a few years ago.)"
6654,best iPhone,"Would tend to agree with minor exceptions. Fair phone is quickly gaining traction especially for its eco friendly features, and with easily replaceable and upgradeable components it should last you QUITE a while. 

Terracube is also a great option(and the only thing we can get in the US as well haha)"
72543,best keyboard switches,"I have the WASD Code with MX Clear keys and while it's not really a ""gaming"" keyboard I think it feels and looks fantastic and the MX clear switches have a nice level of resistance to them."
11365,best gifts for dad,"I hope you'll forgive me for passing on what my dad once told me.He died the day before father's day two years ago, or I would ask him to answer directly.  

I didn't get a lot of time alone with my dad, as mom and my siblings were always there, but we were usually the first ones up in the morning , jokingly fighting over the paper. Once I got a bit older, and no longer lived with my folks , I started a tradition of getting up early, driving to see my Dad and I would take him out to breakfast. We talked about whatever we wanted without mom interrupting or my phone ringing. 

He told me, more than once, that those breakfasts made him feel like he was as needed as my mom, and he used to brag to everyone that his baby was taking him to breakfast. 

I still miss him most in the morning. If you can, find a way to talk with your dad. Ask him about his childhood, the biggest mess he ever made, what he sees of himself in you. Tell him what you love and admire about him. There are so many things I wish I had asked my dad....and I used to ask him a lot. 

My kids don't see their dad. (his choice) we are going to spend the day with a dear friend who missed out on having kids. So..if there's no dad in your lives..maybe borrow one. 

Edit: you're all very kind. I hope those of you missing dads, for whatever reason, get through the advertising blitz with minimal heartache. Than you, anonymous benefactor , for the gold."
