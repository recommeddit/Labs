3836,best online college,"There are tons of State Universities that offer almost all online courses or 100% online to complete a degree. The one thing you need to be careful of is that although it will not say on your degree you were an online student it will sometimes list a campus or college that has no physical presence. That is how an employer will be able to tell you did online.

That being said there are colleges where they will simply list the college campus or college on the degree that has a physical presence. With those no one can tell you are online only. I just say this if this is something you care about because online does have a stigma about it.

Here are some colleges I can think off the top of my head that are legit state online colleges that have a physical location and are well known.

Colorado State University
Missouri State Online
Penn State Online 
Arizona State 
Thomas Edison University

Those are just off the top of my head. One thing to remember is that some universities do not advertise being online only but you can usually get 90% of your degree online. For example I know a university that requires you to take 12 credits in person and you can take the rest online."

65844,best college in california,"By all your criteria, the University of Cambridge is the best public university in the world. It is consistently ranked amongst the top universities in the world by multiple independent ranking systems, and always higher than any UC campus. 

It also has over 90 Nobel prizes associated with it, which is impressive as the UC system has around four times the academic staff as Cambridge.

The university of Cambridge are involved in almost all sports imaginable, often with dozens of teams for popular sports. The top echelons can hire out international sports stadiums to play and is broadcast on TV, something no other UK university other than Oxford does. In this respect it matches the US universities.

Cambridge runs a collegiate system, and is a public school, so it is possible to get the best."
