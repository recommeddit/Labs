"There are some action films that are highly acclaimed. The best historical examples I can think of would be some of Akira Kurosawa's samurai flicks, like **Seven Samurai**, **Yojimbo**, and **The Hidden Fortress**. There is also the Kurosawa-scripted **Runaway Train** from the late 1980s that is considered a minor classic.

Recently, you had **Mad Max: Fury Road** as the most acclaimed film of 2015. That was probably the most well-reviewed straight action film I can think of.

Sam Peckinpah was controversial in his time, but I think we can safely say that his best films are taken pretty seriously, and almost all of them feature action in some form or another: **The Wild Bunch**, **Straw Dogs**, **Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid**, **Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia**, **Cross of Iron**... some are a little more meditative than your typical action films, but are basically crossover ""arthouse action"".

I suppose you could argue that the classiest form of action film is the adventure film, where a lot of the ""action"" is more cerebral. **Lawrence of Arabia** comes to mind. John Huston's adventure films - **The Treasure of the Sierra Madre** and **The Man Who Would Be King** being my favorites - are held in very high honor. Maybe not exactly ""action"" films, but extremely high quality adventure films that contain some exciting action scenes.

I'd say that filmmakers like Ridley and Tony Scott made many prestige action films, too. Ridley's were maybe more appreciated by the critics at the time, but both their careers are spotted with action flicks that are given some scholarly weight nowadays. They made movies at an extremely high quality of craftsmanship that scholars find meaty in their themes and subject matter, so I think their best films probably fall into this category."
Completely agree. Seveneves was two-thirds of a great book.
"I don't wanna agree, but I gotta somewhat."
"I've been on Fi since summer 2016. It *is not* going to be better than Verizon. I've lived in SF for most of that time, now live in northern East Bay and if I'm not on T-Mo, the service is nearly useless. The fact that I have to manually switch to T-Mo so often is incredibly frustrating. 

Every time I'm  stuck looking for signal, the people in my group who invariably have signal are Verizon customers. I really dislike Verizon's tactics and prices, but at this point I will readily admit that they are the superior network in the Bay Area (and the mountains as well)."

I think it's just one of those skills you have to keep using to get good with. I never used archery on ps4.
I never said it couldn’t be fun to listen to but when it’s all wonky and unbalanced it isn’t as enjoyable imo.
"LOL, less “cool”. I don’t think anyone wouldn’t be impressed by a skilled pianist. The only problem is that electric guitars start with a “cool factor” (to non musicians), whereas on a piano you really have to earn it."
"Circuit boards. Like, raspberry pis and arduino and such.  

Little remote helicopters.  

Fluffy shit, like microfiber blankets and such.  

Art."
This is exactly what I am afraid of. If I can't watch streams or videos then there is no point to buying second one.
"They had Tevez and Rooney who would chase the ball around the entire pitch if they had to. Carick had IMO the best season in his life. Scholes was Scholes. Hargreaves also brought so much with him into the team this season, specially with his pace. The defense was probably the best in Europe at this moment. Ronaldo could win games on his own. And the counter-attacks with Ronaldo,Tevez and Rooney was almost unstoppable. 

I agree it was not the best team ever, but i think they would be able to give play evenly and even win against all of the teams mentioned in this thread."
"Bali... We went there a couple of years ago. Had a fabulous time. We spent a lot of time with locals, and there were all to friendly/nice."
I second this it’s a great case and if you don’t like the clear case due to fingerprints and smudges get the marsclimber which is matte.
Untold is free till a certain point in the story but it’s an awesome game.
I still get so many compliments on this one too!
"> By the way, you can click view other sellers and specifically choose Amazon to buy from directly

I’ve gotten items that I thought were “directly” from them and ended up being FBA. I though I was buying Amazon stock but I got third party stock. I know this because they directly told me so. Don’t know what variables lead to this (maybe out of stock items?) but Amazon has no problem letting you believe stock originated from them. Twice I’ve called them out on this (car parts,work boots) and they apologized and offered return refund, or partial refunds to keep items."
"I think it’s because Endgame has much more depth as a movie than Infinity War. IW is an amazing movie, but it has basically no character development besides Thanos and possibly Gamora. Endgame has a clear theme of our reactions to loss and how we redeem ourselves from that, which is reflected through every Avenger. Infinity War is basically 2 hours of action with emotional moments sprinkled in, which is completely fine because Endgame and Infinity War are meant to balance each other in that. Fan service or not, Endgame has much more heart, which makes you more invested in the movie and the Avengers ultimate triumph."
Zion Canyon - went there for a Native American flute festival. Great festival and gorgeous scenery.
"That's what I thought as well, but actually, he's quite far down [the list](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;orderby=batting_average;spanmax1=31+Dec+1900;spanmin1=01+Jan+1801;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting) of Test averages in the nineteenth century, even if you ignore the people that only played a couple of matches. He's twelfth of the people that played more than ten.  Special shoutout to KS Ranjitsinhji (ENG), who averaged 53.88 from 12 games."
"I must have missed Reddit Mobile 101.

Thanks...."
"Not a dentist, but was recently told this by mine:

It's not only about how long you brush your teeth, but also how. She told me the brush should be angled to touch the top of the gums as well as the bottom of your teeth. Also to brush in circular motions if you're using a traditional toothbrush (as opposed to an electric one). What else... also to brush behind your teeth by angling the brush."
