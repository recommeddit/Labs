15805,best sunglasses for fashion,"There's really only two things I feel strongly about for sunglasses:

1. Polarized or bust. I've seen polarized pairs at gas stations for <$15, I can't stand wearing sunglasses that aren't polarized. They just aren't worth it in my opinion and you don't need to spend $$$ to get it if you try.
2. ""Face Shape"" is largely bullshit. I have no idea what my face shape is and have yet to be able to correctly categorize anyone's face shape ever. Just go to a gas station or a random sunglasses hut and try on literally every pair. I've worn both aviators and wayfairer look-alikes and they both look pretty good despite round and square frames often being recommended as opposites.

My guide: buy polarized, try on literally any pair you can get your hands on."

62173,Best RPG game on PS4,I couldn’t agree more except that I got too frustrated that I couldn’t finish around chapter 11 or so (where you’re stuck in that stupid factory steathing around.
70551,best major to study in college,"Most academical studies can be achieved by the average person if the person tries hard enough.

In addition, if you care about money, understand money at the end of day is simply trading of numbers (supply and demand). Hence, being good at math generally gives you a comparative advantage for higher pay. It does not help that most careers in demand also happen to depend heavily on math itself (since more mathematically focused careers tend to have lower supply for its demand).

As a note, higher level math is not just numbers. Don't be afraid. Math is the study of logic and reasoning through constraint creativity. You might just end up liking math, who knows.

Also, as a general rule of thumb, things people hate tend to pay more. Likewise, things people love or have easier time doing tend to pay less. This is just supply and demand on a nutshell. So just avoiding anything ""hard"" and expecting results generally does not work out well. And this is especially true for fields that people relate more to with ""difficulty""."

38311,best newspapers to read,"Worse than that, the Hebdo cartoons are ham-fisted and lazy. You don't leave yourself much room for being clever, insightful, or astute when your humor doesn't rise above the level of the people you're pillorying."
55355,best action and adventure novel series,"[Bloody Jack](http://www.goodreads.com/series/41931-bloody-jack) series by LA Meyer. Set in various locations in the early 1800s, with a naval/nautical flair. Not particularly intellectual, but very entertaining and action-packed. I'm up to book 6 so far (mostly listening to the audiobooks, which are brilliant), and haven't gotten bored yet."

49524,best gaming monitor,"None howsoever. There are many high refresh rate monitors out there that don't look or are advertised as ""gaming monitors"", even though they make for good gaming monitors.

Always look at the real specs of a monitor and not at what the vendor advertises: panel type, resolution, refresh rate, input lag, contrast ratio etc."

54541,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Hey Bro great review!

55486,best action and adventure novel series,"You know I've never heard of Gemmell before, thanks for that. Which of his books would you recommend first?"
38034,best Marvel movie,"This isn't how it works. When you get a metacritic 89, that's an average of 8.9. Percentages on the tomatometer are just the percentage of people who like it, not an average rating. Rotten Tomatoes does have an average rating feature, which I'm fairly sure would give a more agreeable list.

For Example, Doctor Strange got 89%, but an average rating of 7.31, but infinity war got a score of 7.61, so according to Rotten Tomatoes, Infinity War is the better film no? Yet it's nowhere to be seen here but Dr Strange is."
