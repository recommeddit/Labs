I can only imagine. I only did a 2 week hike and it was really hard to come back."

61093,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Arrested Development is fantastic especially on the second viewing, because you can pick up on the foreshadowing you missed the first time through."
17016,best iOS game,Worth it to buy ? :((
5080,best home improvement store,"This.  Also for more advanced homeowners the HD near me is better, especially with wood selection.  The customer service is horrible, unfortunately.

Edit: Lowe's won't do home delivery for me where HD will. Sorry, I don't own a pickup for deck lumber..."
19023,best YouTube video,"That was gonna be my suggestion aswell.

It is fascinating how lost you can get in watching some dude narrating while he's picking locks."
63776,best books for building better habits reddit,"The ones I read for this article or just a general list? I read a lot of books so if general I'll give a top 10, but it'll help me if you shared what your interests are."

70014,best major to study in college,"I haven't seen anyone mention any degrees with a plan to be pre-med, but I just wanted to share my two cents. Medical schools in the US are inundated with applications from biology majors and chemistry majors, from kids with 3.5+ GPAs.  It's difficult to stand out. They are often looking for people who don't purely have a science background. So don't feel you have to do bio or chem as a major. 

If you can fulfill your prerequisites while doing another major, go for it. You certainly don't have to major in a science field, and it may actually benefit you *not* to."
13100,best gifts for mom,Very exspensive wine
16696,best pet for toddlers,"We gradually worked our way up from betta fish to hermit crab to guinea pig to cat.

One thing I’ve learned is sometimes the “low maintenance” pets are harder and more expensive to care for than just getting a dog or cat."
71008,best movies with a cool twist,The prestige and Arrival are really big ones. The handmaiden is filled with plot twists as well.
54586,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I initially went with the zero thinking it would be the safest route as I have been on GSRs for a few years now. Objectively, the ostu v2 sounds like it would probably be the one if it is a mix between speed + control between the zero and hien. Looks like amazon does not have the ostu v2 in stock (only v1 otsu). I'll prolly grab one off the official website then whenever they restock and since shipping is quite expensive maybe grab the hien from there as well to make the shipping price worth it. 

Thanks again!"
32500,best vacation resort,"That's how it's been for us every time. We always joke about how my Mr makes a bartender boyfriend at every area of the resort. They'll learn how you like your drinks and everything. This last trip was a double babymoon (my bff was due a couple weeks after me!) and the bartenders learned what the men liked to drink and would even offer it at our meals (""the usual, sirs?""). And they learned what flavors the ladies liked and would make up fun mocktails for us not to feel left out."
30675,best country to live in,Bad neighbor.
45506,best gaming system,"This is a typo I wouldn't change either.

29119,best calendar tool,"I've been trying the free version this morning, looks very similar to BC2. I like the week view though. And the widget with full month + daily events on the bottom.

But can't see much more differences.

Thanks for the suggestion"
38748,best web browser,"I don't get it, why Microsoft Edge is the best? That's a default browser for Windows 10. For a personal preference, I would prefer a browser that can handle lots of open tabs..."
39232,best web browser,I use brave and it's the best I can't go back to other browsers
23366,best car racing video game,"It was ok, but PC2 was miles better. PC3 shouldn't even really share the same name as PC2, it's so drastically different. 

On a wheel, it just feels like an arcade game. And not a great one."
