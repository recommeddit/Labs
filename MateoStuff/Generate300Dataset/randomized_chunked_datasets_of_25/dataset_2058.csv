2740,best headphones,"Is Arctis Pro Wireless still the only choice after all these years if I want to connect to two devices simultaneously via wireless and bluetooth?

Honestly I'm not a pro-gamer whatsover who need to hear every pin drop at perfect precision. Being wireless itself is a good enough qol feature to me over many other stuff, as long as I can hear the game sound and voicechat normally. 

This is actually coming from an ex-Arctis Pro Wireless user looking for replacement. The transmitter just died suddenly (not recognisible by any console) after ~2 years. I enjoyed the experience, but just not really confident enough in buying the same product again."
53712,best medicine for a cold,"I did this on my honeymoon when i came down with a cold (and coincidentally a massive pimple that I still have a spot from) in London. I boiled myself, drank hot tea, and passed out under the covers. ""Sweated it out"" as they say."
37729,best Marvel movie,"Best: Infinity war. My expectations were high and the movie blew them. Seen it 3 times in theaters, I never do that.

Worst: Thor the dark world. Damaging for the characters. It is probably the only movie that accomplish nothing. (They gain the reality stone)"
64644,Best Nike running shoes,Epic React if you can find it.
23138,best social networking site for CS,"I don't think it matters, but Linkedin is very useful for professional networking. Github is useful for learning about git. 

If you're worried about seeming anti-social, just create a Facebook account and add some of your friends. You don't have to like it, post anything, or make anything public. You can do the same on Twitter. Just follow people who might tweet about things that interest you. You don't have to tweet anything yourself, and you might get something out of it."
