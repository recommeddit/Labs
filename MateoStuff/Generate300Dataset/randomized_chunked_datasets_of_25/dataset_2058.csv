2740,"Is Arctis Pro Wireless still the only choice after all these years if I want to connect to two devices simultaneously via wireless and bluetooth?

Honestly I'm not a pro-gamer whatsover who need to hear every pin drop at perfect precision. Being wireless itself is a good enough qol feature to me over many other stuff, as long as I can hear the game sound and voicechat normally. 

This is actually coming from an ex-Arctis Pro Wireless user looking for replacement. The transmitter just died suddenly (not recognisible by any console) after ~2 years. I enjoyed the experience, but just not really confident enough in buying the same product again.",best headphones

If you're worried about seeming anti-social, just create a Facebook account and add some of your friends. You don't have to like it, post anything, or make anything public. You can do the same on Twitter. Just follow people who might tweet about things that interest you. You don't have to tweet anything yourself, and you might get something out of it.",best social networking site for CS
