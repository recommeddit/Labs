Thought I’d be out of questions but is it worth paying $200 more for another 500 gigs of storage and 16 gigs more ram? Trying to get a laptop to last me at least 6 years
And me!!! My saturdays are spent working my way through the Guardian and eating crisps. Either that or working.
"Grammerly: it picks up on easily confused words, preposition errors, and all sorts of sentence problems that most grammar checkers don't catch."
That happens on non boogies at bigger DZs.  I've had times where I just finished my wingsuit flight to see other people opening up pretty close.  It's fun to watch from 2k but a little freaky too since all of a sudden you have all this extra traffic.  It's quite common though depending on spacing to have one load just landing while the other is dropping at big dzs especially if 3 planes are going.
Firefox feels great
Don't get a brilliant quality webcam if you internet is shit.
My ps4 is now dinner and netflix machine
It blows my mind honestly
Kourt is my fave I don’t really have a least fave Kim and Khloe do annoy me the most but with Kim it’s usually her stans that make her more annoying to me and Khloe it’s her delusion
High Tension and Diabolique...both blindsided me.

"I'm too lazy/tired to type out the recipe but I created a jamon (as in Serrano, as in fancy ham) gelato for a chocolate dessert not too long ago and it actually did really well. Very umami and Parmesan-like at first, then sweet and milky with a distinct chicharron/crackling finish."
Didn't sound rhetorical to me. I thought you were really wondering why people didn't mention it.
"I just spent a while looking for some Graphic Audio titles, and I actually successfully found them on forum(dot)snahp(dot)it! Plus it's a DDL site, which I prefer over torrents."

"Novamin remineralises teeth in a slightly different way than fluoride - so it helps slow down caries, and definitely reduces sensitivity in places where enamel is eroded. 

Evidence doesn’t show it to be overwhelmingly better, but it seems to be a slight but significant remineralising advantage against normal toothpaste: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422065/
Certainly enough for me to spend the extra $20 a year to use it."
"Same. The sandalwoody vanilla-y fragrance of Kevin Murphy products is now a critical part of my own “signature” scent. It ties in really nicely with my favorite perfume, which is Le Labo‘s Patchouli 24, and every time I use KM curl cream, I get loads of compliments on it."

"I bought a life sized Allosaurus Skull from a garage sale at some out of business highway attraction for a hundred bucks, so probably that. https://imgur.com/a/avgDwLB"
"Carla, stop trying to kill Diane."
"I'll never understand how High Tension has a twist when right at the start it >!tells you all events up to the gas station are Marie's version of it. She says in the opening scene something like ""are you recording?""!<"
I agreed with you on vietnam and Gulf war.  Korean war I always thought of as similar to Vietnam in the sense that the US was trying to stop the spread of the Soviets/communism.  Which I lean to an isolationist viewpoint that we shouldn't use our people to fight in foreign wars when there has been no attack on the US.

"Hell, I'd be surprised too. The game survived 15 years basically through mods alone. Steamspy tells me there's around 40000 who bought the v2.3.1, which is way more than I imagined (though not a huge number by Steam standards)."
Have razer green and greetech blues been shown to have the same housing?
