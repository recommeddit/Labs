2622,best headphones,"agreed for IEMs, $200 for portables because that's where the NAD is, and $200 for full sized because that's where the AKG k7s and hd580/used hd600s are. worst value imo are portables and best value would be a tie between $100 IEMs and low $200 full size headphones."

32704,best vacation resort,"They're like spring break for adults. If you're just looking to sit on the beach and drink and be around other people looking to do the same, all-inclusive is the way to go. It doesn't matter where you go either because they all look the same from the beach and you're not really going to be getting any cultural experience or local food sampling b/c it's all cookie cutter resort food."
36230,best alcoholic drink,Agreed. This shot is mostly pointless. People think they're getting so much more fucked up just because they are mixing 3-5 liquors. Really all you're doing is making a shot more unpleasant for yourself depending on what your taste in whisk(e)y/scotch is.

34339,best NFL player,I know I’m biased but not having Justin tucker- arguably the greatest kicker ever- or Lamar in the top 50 is absurd
61851,Best RPG game on PS4,"Nice list.  Diablo III is definitely a game I need to try, especially considering how cheap it is now."
4759,best home improvement store,"Home depot allows dogs so I usually went there, although for really quick trips Lowes was a little closer so I'd go there sometimes. I sold my house and moved now I only go to HD since there isn't a Lowes nearby."

72412,best keyboard switches,"I used cherry reds which were very nice.
I'm on kahli boxed whites atm. More force needed for clicks but I don't click anything by accident. 
I recommend going to a store and test switches before buying."
