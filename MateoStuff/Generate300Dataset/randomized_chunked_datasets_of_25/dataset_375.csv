6467,"**David Attenborough Nature Documentary Series** - 1 Hour each, between 8-10 episodes per series

There's a few of these on Netflix right now, and they're all amazing. David Attenborough has a way of telling a tale of the natural world that I haven't found with any other documentarian. He breaks things down in such a way that you learn so much but are left being able to draw your own conclusions and walk away wondering about deeply interesting issues and questions. I've never seen someone who is so capable of explaining nature so succinctly and deeply as him.

There seems to be a disease in most modern nature documentaries lately that just ends up with them all being so dumbed-down and childish. The David Attenborough documentaries never have this problem. They neither assume that you're a biologist nor do they see you as an utter simpleton and talk down to you. I've never watched any nature documentaries as good as those produced, written, and narrated, as those from Mr. Attenborough. Watch them!

Let me know what you think, here :)!
