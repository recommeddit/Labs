43869,best items under $100,"You could go for the amazon fire tv stick. I bought one when they were announced and I love it so far. Comes with a remote control so you don't have to rely on your phone to cast content like you do with the chromecast. Has amazon prime, Netflix, hulu, pandora, and plex, plus lots of other stuff that I never use."

27111,best board games,"I only play this way now. When you're building towards an engine, non-drafting makes it super difficult. Just feels better when you do it as you're more likely to get relevant cards of course. For anyone who hasn't tried it this way - you won't regret it but it adds a slightly increase in time"

65034,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,My only problem with El Bajio is their price point. I took a group of co-workers there and was shocked at the $13 Tortas. That’s ridiculous!
47136,best state to visit in the United States,"As far as satisfying your gf, you could do a stopover in NYC on your way to some place else.  NYC has great sites, shopping, clubbing, food, Broadway, etc.  The NFL has preseason games in August, I think.  Check out the Jets and Giants. 

Don't forget to check out hostels... they do exist in the USA.  I suggest private rooms if available.

The US is huge, so depending on how much time you have pick out a few places to visit.  If you're into museums, history, and politics DC is cool to visit too."
35032,best NFL player,"The first time I ever even heard the term GOAT in reference to the greatest of all time was around 2011-12 and was about Jerry Rice. Seems like even over just the past decade, his legacy has become underrated."

11362,best gifts for dad,"I am surprised this is way down the list. I want a cooked breakfast served to be in bed, then everyone has to GTFO of the house and let me sit in front of the TV watching movies, reading a book, playing games or staring at the wall until it's beer time. Then you can come back in and we can have pizza and watch some Disney together. Then you all go to bed and I watch another movie and blissfully fall asleep.

I might get the breakfast. Then I will have to 'do' something.

Bah. Humbug."
68946,best science fiction novel,It’s very fun but my least favorite of her work (I also generally prefer epic fantasy to urban fantasy though so not unexpected). I’d probably have enjoyed it more if I was more familiar with New York though it still works without that familiarity.
