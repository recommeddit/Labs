It will reach deeper down into pockets in your gums better than any other. Along the same lines, brush your gums, not your teeth. Focus on placing your Sonicare right along the gumline, and your teeth will still be cleaned as well. If you do indeed have an electric toothbrush, don't move it around as you brush, let it do the work. Place it along the gumline and keep it still in each spot for at least a few seconds.

As for toothpaste, I prefer ProNamel. I get a lot of canker sores, which can be caused by Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, an ingredient used to make your toothpaste get sudsy (your shampoo too). While it does not help clean your teeth, it makes people feel like it does, so it is included in most toothpastes simply for this reason. Sensodyne products including ProNamel do not have this ingredient. There are only a few brands with a toothpaste that does not include this ingredient, so if you get canker sores often, read the label before you buy. However, if you do not have sensitive teeth or get canker sores, most toothpastes will do the trick just fine. Except Crest ProHealth. It doesn't actually clean very well. If you are prone to cavities, get something with extra flouride, such as Flouridex (you may be able to get this from your dental professional). 

As others have said, flossing is very important. Even with a Sonicare, plaque can still be left behind that only floss can get. If you have a history of gum disease such as gingivitis or periodontal disease (my specialty), there are a few things extra you can do to help save your teeth from costly repairs or replacements. Buy a WaterPik (they're about $50). I have seen shocking improvements in pocket depths and infections of the gums by simply using a WaterPik. Also, floss well and use an antiseptic rinse. Look at the label, because many brands such as Listerine offer a flouride rinse that will help prevent cavities, and an antiseptic rinse that will help clean out gum pockets and prevent infection and bleeding.",best toothpaste
