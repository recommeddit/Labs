"Oh wow, that must've been like one of the few places I didn't look. They actually have a decent selection, thanks."
Derek Jeter's Driven cologne smells pretty good. Another one i use is Fahrenheit by Dior. My favorite has to be Dreamer by Versace
"How so? A C on the 6th string does not look related to a C on the 5th string, 5th to 4th etc... 
For instance... I could not pick out all the C notes on every string, without sitting and counting them, but on the piano... C... it's the one that comes before 2 black ones. And moving on from that... a 3rd and 5th... easy to count up to on the keys, but having to count on the fret board is a little trickier.
There is no doubt that if you can master the fretboard though, that the musical side of the piano will come a lot easier."
"I prefer breakfast at dinner, or brinner if you will. 
For brinner I like the traditional American breakfast. Two eggs scrambled, bacon, hashbrowns, and chocolate milk."
"Adirondacks are not part of the AT, there's equally stunning views in Maine and New Hampshire but it only covers a small section of southern NY. 

They should both be on your bucket list of hikes, but don't wait until you are too old!!!!"
Love LSD and Rocket singh!
Reddit has comment saving built in now ;)
"Static banner ads are perfectly fine. Even animated ads that stop after a few seconds are fine by me; it when the ads never ever stopped moving, when they started yelling at you the instant the page loaded, and when they literally covered the entire fucking browser window that I downloaded my first adblocker. 

The sad thing is that since adblockers have gotten common, they've only doubled-down on the invasiveness of the ads."
"Bryan Cranston.

He visited the small base in Germany I was at. Talked with a lot of folks and hopped in a simulator. Awesome guy, very down to earth and friendly."
it would have been funny if your parents didn't know who he was and tried to tip him.
I have ranger nnn and vifm installed but to be honest I mostly use Pcmanfm because when I don't need to do something that is easier through GUI I just navigate through ls and cd.

"[White Panda--The Midnight Life (Kanye/M83)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uEKLAmqxWY)

I'm not a huge fan of Kanye, but this remix is great."
I would rank Shahrukh first also. Seems most people have him near the bottom. Maybe because of his recent films
I got the cheapest icarez screen protector and I forget itâ€™s on most of the time.
its basically just a shot of caffeine
"Looks like no one has said Hannibal for some ungodly reason. So yeah;

Hannibal

Prodigal Son"
I have some good news for you!
"There are two reasons why I play games, either the theme of the game or the gameplay.

Theme wise, I like fantasy, sci-fi and Japanese themed games. Gameplay wise, I like mmorpg (World of warcraft, ffxiv), strategy games (civilization series), platformer (Shovel knight, blaster master), metroidvania (castlevania series, metroid series, the messenger, guacamelee) and JRPG (old final fantasy series until 12, suikoden series, child of Light - even though it's not really a Japanese game -)"
"Okay, I'll stay away from Dreamweaver and get Sublime Text. Definitely not ready for Vim.

I'll try and get someone from my university's computer science course interested in my project. Maybe we can find a way to get something out of it mutually. If that doesn't work, hopefully a professional would be willing to guide me instead."
">Does Dark Souls allow you to RP a hard line, lawful good character? Or a selfish warrior? Or approach you with ethical questions?

actually yes, every time you play online or meet a NPC these things enter into consideration."
"The National Treasure movies get a lot of flak but fuck that those movies are fun and awesome.  We need more fun, large scope adventures like that."
"under 70g hmmm no sorry most gaming mouses are around 80g and up

madcatz is trying to make lighter mouses but dunno about the quality of the new lineup.

logitech has the gpro wireless the g203 and g305

roccat has some light mouses too and razer has the abyssus."
I don't know why those rotating muscle arms are so hilarious.
