"I have two.  The first is Jerry Springer.  I met him while traveling when we happened to be staying at the same hotel.  He was super nice, took photos and answered questions.  All smiles and jokes.  

The second is Stephen Spielburg.  I met him at some benefit I got invited to as a teen due to having good grades or some shit and he not only had a super normal convo with me, but when I told him where I really wanted to work (but hadn't been able to get an interview) he took me to the next table where the company's CEO was and introduced me.  Worked there for 5 years after."
I do something similar to the English muffins but make burritos instead. The tortillas heat up pretty well in the microwave and you can use potatoes to bulk it out.
"FWIW 

I enlisted in the navy as a corpsman out of high school. I made it up to E6 and went to the university while in the reserves. I spent over a year in Iraq when I was in my early twenties.

 Please spare me the i didnt drive myself to the point of utter exhaustion to give someone a better life cause i lived it ever waking moment as a hospital corpsman. 

I gave up my active duty salary and orders to Europe in order to get a quality education because I knew how important education was to me.  Now I'm an officer on my 9th year of service. 

I had plenty of context to apply my studies. Shit I did my masters thesis on Iraq after I spent so much time there. 

I don't think less of the person, I just don't hold their degree in the same regard because they aren't the same.  There is no comparison between the degrees."
The roots and thought get slept on all the time IMO. He's one of the most overlooked M.C.'s ever.
First movie I thought of when I saw the the post title

Why do you think it's poorly written?

"Like someone mentioned, there isnâ€™t much to skip. Obviously hit Ka, el Toro, nitro, Batman, joker can be fun, bizarro is cool, I have a soft spot for the mine train but itâ€™s rough, Jersey devil if thatâ€™s open lol. Basically everything but the dark night. Personally I donâ€™t think green lantern is bad as long as you properly prepare your seat and brace yourself."
"Just use MX Linux, tweak it installing you programs, MX Snapshot, and thatâ€™s it"

Then join the room."

"That is true, yes. He was exactly 30 when he debuted."
"""One Day at a Time"" was something she [posted on my wall](https://i.ibb.co/MkTrZ1G/PXL-20210820-035422290.jpg) the day I had a real bad mental health day (I have bipolar, wasnt diagnosed or medicated then). She could tell something was off and came over, and a week later we confessed we were in love with each other and had been for years.  ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜­"
"1. A Civil Campaign, by Lois McMaster Bujold.   
The culmination of the entire series, with almost every thread throughout the series pulled taut. So many loveable characters in a sci\-fi Regency\-esque political romance.  

2. Mirror Dance, by Lois McMaster Bujold.  
A sudden but natural shift in the series, with a new character examining Miles' life from outside. A welcome perspective, though tonally dark.  

3. Armor, by John Steakley.  
A story of two threads, blending perfectly. Felix, a soldier in an eternal war against alien bugs along the lines of Starship Troopers, matched with Jack Crow, a space pirate whom IMO Disney ripped off \(and then made family friendly\) for Pirates of the Carribbean.  

4. Fall of Hyperion, by Dan Simmons.  
The first book fell majorly flat for me, but its protagonists were thankfully cast in a new light by this sequel, which allows them to actually reach their destination. The conclusion of Fall of Hyperion is about as epic a SciFi book can manage \- it's probably my favorite ending ever, possibly tied with Armor above.  

5. Oryx and Crake, by Margaret Atwood.  
Post\-apocalyptic done right. It tells in retrospective the story of how humanity went in extinct. A beautiful and painful expose of humanity in its last years, with a larger\-than\-life antagonist."
Tried troll patrol?

"I think ochocinco is a cool dude. 

A fan followed him on twitter and tweeted at him numerous times over the course of two years and never got a response.

He tweets something like ""hey man I've followed and tweeted you for two years, you never replied, what's up with that?""

Ochocinco said ""my bad man, want to come to my game on Saturday?"" 

and then flew the fan out to see the game and hooked him up with a bunch of gear.

That's cool."
"They're all volunteers, making everything from scratch, and following microsoft's ""terms and conditions"" (Something like that) to the letter. Which means they can't sell it either; Halo Pc for everyone! Although, i really wish they were allowed to receive donations."
"Not the poster you replied to but I'm American and been to India lots of times to visit. The opulence in India is off the charts. There is very little middle ground: hotels and restaurants are typically either ridiculously fancy and expensive or they are completely basic and somewhat questionable. I stayed in a beach hut literally on the sand in Goa for less than $5USD/night and the Taj hotel in Hyderabad which was closer to $500. 
People are so nice and helpful all throughout the country. It's really easy as a foreigner to fuck up one of the local customs (e.g. walk into a shrine with shorts, ordering beer during a holy day) but locals laugh it off and help inform you in a polite way. 
Absolutely recommend visiting India especially the jungles of Kerala and the magical city of Varanasi."
"Looks like /u/Zuendl11 was right. Wikipedia says, ""[Stracciatella](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stracciatella_(ice_cream) ) is a variety of gelato, consisting of milk-based ice cream filled with fine, irregular shavings of chocolate."""
"Am cellist, can confirm itâ€™s accurate."
They wouldn't want to suffocate under the extra cash pile.
Do you test it? I read some feedback: great design but bad protection if the phone is fallen. Do you confirm it?
