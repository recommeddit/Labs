38668,best newspapers to read,"For serious quality journalism, read the FT. Its news and public policy coverage isn't as extensive as it could be, but the stories that do feature are written far better than in other papers.

Other broadsheets are OK but all highly predictable in their bias and selective reporting. The Telegraph in particular is now a parody of itself."

71354,best movies with a cool twist,I was okay with the bible being in a language only some people know but the real twist was that he was blind while clearly playing the character as being able to see. The twist would have been great if it was a latin bible or something. But like this it was really bad imo.

13247,best gifts for mom,"something I suggested before on a different post.  As a SAHM the thing I miss out on the most is the little notes and cards and scribbled drawings that my kids give to their dad.  I know that the baby's too young to even make a mess, but find a sweet card and include the baby's foot print as a signature.  Over time you'll gather a small collection of these little treasures, and while she gets to be with the kid all the time, her treasure box will be lacking in comparison."

35182,best NFL player,"1. Rodgers   
2. Mahomes   
3. Donald   
4. Brady   
5. Henry   
6. Kelce   
7. Watt   
8. Adams   
9. Wilson   
10. Tyreek   

I could see any of the top 4 being #1, but based on previous lists there seems to be some hesitancy with Mahomes. Rodgers would fall right in line with Lamar last year, just the dominant MVP season.   

Brady could jump up of course, but I'm not entirely sure when voting was done. In past years they did it right before the Super Bowl. Either way, he'll be up there.   

Donald is just the safe choice that I guarantee will be top 4, just doubt he has enough support to be #1. Maybe something happens where Rodgers/Mahomes/Brady eat into each others' votes, but doubt it.   

Very confident Henry, Kelce, Watt and Adams will be the next group. Henry's season was historic, so he gets the nod. Could see any of the next 3 in any order though.   

Russ lost a bit of shine this year but he'll still be top 10. Maybe someone like Allen starts eating into his votes though.   

10 is a bit of a wildcard, but I'll go with Tyreek. Just think he's too much of a gamebreaker. Players with really splashy skillsets usually do really well in these lists.   

I can see Ramsey and Garrett challenging for 10. Maybe Hopkins but I think he drops just outside. Allen is the wildcard, I don't think he'll be top 10 though."
