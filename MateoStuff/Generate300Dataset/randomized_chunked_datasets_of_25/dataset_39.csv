65193,"There is really no difference in 99% of places. Verizon is not really that much better than T-mobile in a lot of places but they go by the Apple philosophy of charge more and people assume that means higher quality. The caveat to that is more rural areas or off the beaten path in places like that you will likely find some better than others.

I work on a concrete building that gives a lot of people issues and my work is not far from a concert venue and my T-mobile has SO many less issues with the building than people paying more for AT&T or Verizon and when a concert is going on people I work with that have those tend to see their service more bogged down from the crowds than mine ever has.

A lot of money is spent making people think one is going to be better than the other in a big metro area or along a massive interstate, but rarely have I actually seen that be the case.",best phone service company

62225,">I never felt like I had to do any side quests to keep up with my leveling. Of course, I have not finished yet, so maybe that'll change once I'm past 50 or so. 

It won't. Level 50 was the original level cap so you will never be underleveled for any (non-DLC, not sure about DLC since I was 70+ by the time first episode dropped) zones after 50. Depending on your settings, enemies might be 2 levels above or below you but you won't have to grind experience or anything of the sort to progress with the story.",Best RPG game on PS4

Also he's a huge Alabama fan so the color of the cooler goes well with his fandom.",best gifts for dad
