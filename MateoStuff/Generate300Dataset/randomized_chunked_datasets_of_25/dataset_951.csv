Removing it today. There's no way I'm leaving that on my system with the Chinese. I'd rather chrome than opera now"
38386,best newspapers to read,Haha. Last year I grabbed a DT every morning while walking to class... Small world.
48398,best color to paint with,"I completely understand trying to keep a house clean with small children. I think white is always a safe choice. It’s easier to take care of with touch ups and it most definitely make that already large living space appear that much larger. If it were me I would consider a very light blue, just something that compliments that room. You have a great canvas to work with, good luck!"

16299,best sunglasses for fashion,I have a pair of Oakley Frogskins that have similar lenses. They're my go-to casual glasses. I think I paid ~$160 for them a few years ago but the fact that they have polarized lenses bumped up the price a bit
16823,best pet for toddlers,"You need to wait until your kid is older, until he starts asking for a dog. 

Dogs don't generally do very well being left alone all day every day, unless you hire someone to walk them. I think you should look at other pets like a cat. Yes, I know, cats are crap, but they're much lower maintenance than a dog."
53785,best medicine for a cold,"I feel like there may be truth to this. Whenever things are particularly crazy at work, which lasts for 7-8 months at a time, almost no one gets sick. But within two weeks of wrapping up a project, it's fucking plaguetown. Legitimately sick mother fuckers everywhere. Deadly sick, miss your vacation sick."
51788,best iphone case,I disagree. The apple leather case feels very stiff and actually requires some effort to remove it. I’m using the black official leather case with an iPhone 12
13338,best spreadsheet editor,"You can! You use a nested formula called importrange, but it certainly works, as I've done it."
16540,best pet for toddlers,"Chameleons are expensive and don't live all that long.

Rats are great, but, honestly, your two year old would probably be just as well off with a plant.  And with two cats it will end up being less work for you."

59685,best perfume,"Just wanted to add that Versace Bright Crystal would be another good one to try that’s quite affordable. It is very fresh, with a rose note. I remember that I got mini sizes of this and the Yellow Diamond on Amazon. I checked to see if they still had them and ran across this little gift set that has the two plus Crystal Noir. I like that one too, it has a sensual vibe to it imo, with a coconut note. A nice evening fragrance. I think you can still get these individually as minis too, but here’s the set if you’re interested, for about $30.

56365,best desktop monitor,"42” OLED TV for most likely $1000 vs how much are those super HDR monitors? $2000? $3000? Unless you’re using your monitor in a super bright room, you’ll probably appreciate the blacks of the OLED more than the lack of peak brightness. But this is an opinion. 

The main issue is that monitor makers have simply kept the industry stagnant and charge a hefty premium. Like how Intel operated until AMD delivered Ryzen. So I’m more excited at the prospect of all these companies soon feeling the heat over their overpriced offerings.

Burn in is the biggest con of OLED for monitor usage, and price is the biggest con of these high end gaming monitors."
