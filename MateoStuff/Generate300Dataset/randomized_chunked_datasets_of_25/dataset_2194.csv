40233,"Maybe just watch a few GPU benchmarks to see what your GPU can do so you can use your smarts to figure out whether there'll be a big bottleneck?

I don't understand the point of CPU benchmarks @ 1080p or higher cause you'll never know if the GPU is bottlenecking and if it is by how much, when and where so you'll never see the true performance of the processor. CPU benchmarks should be done at 720p or lower with graphic settings maxed out (excluding stuff like antialiasing etc. that only taxes the GPU)

And also if you'd test CPUs at 1080p or higher there wouldn't be a point anyway cause most of the benchmarks would be done with a single GPU and that'd likely be the best one available. Am I interested in seeing CPU benchmarks that only point out which is the most cost-effective CPU to play games @ 1080p with a 2080 TI? Not really.

tl;dr: just watch a fucking GPU benchmark if you want to see a GPU benchmark",best midrange CPU

39694,"It certainly opens a lot of doors! CRISPR makes changes to existing DNA but sadly can't introduce full, fresh genes. It can however fix small mutations. However, it is still incredibly hard to control. Even in cell lines that we've tried this exact process in lab for, it took over 1000 tries to get one cell with both DNA strands changed :( People don't want to release it in humans because of the lack of control and because the CRISPR could go and hit other areas of DNA and makes things work. Even worse, we still can't target it to the right cells with 100% accuracy yet, so the CRISPR could go accidentally wreak havoc on the wrong cells.

We did try inserting tumor suppressors about a decade ago and called it Gene Therapy. We used plasmids, viruses, and other delivery mechanisms, but we failed to control it, and the process harmed a lot of patients. I think that with more research and better control, we'll eventually be able to re-introduce tumor suppressor genes. Some epigenetic inhibitors can by causing the ON/OFF switch that silences a tumor suppressor to go away, thus releasing the gene to help against the cancer.

Sorry for the massive answer, but as an undergraduate I always wanted to pursue gene therapy. I was too late by a decade unfortunately, but hopefully we keep getting better at it. Thank you for the listen and feedback!",best podcast for biologists
