Honorable mention: Skyrim SE. My favorite RPG of last gen but it's too similar to the old version to call it a real PS4 game. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good remaster but I didn't play it as much as on last gen because I already knew everything.",Best RPG game on PS4

26980,"Different people come to board games from very different backgrounds.

Someone that plays Dwarf Fortress and understands it would have no problem learning a complex game.

Someone who has played nothing but Go Fish or Candy Crush level stuff probably isn't.

Picking a strategy game for someone that wants to play a social game isn't going to work. Picking a strategy game for someone who wants to challenge themselves is fine.

I've always been a gamer. I agree that you should pick a game appropriate to what the players might be interested in, but beyond that, understand that I'm not saying that you throw Lisboa at everyone, but consider what they are interested in.

If someone is interested in a challenging game about sustenance farming, then Agricola is a fine place to start. If they are expecting Farmville, it's obviously not.",best board games

I have never looked into other spreadsheet programs, but my guess is I'd be surprised if another software were considerably better at something.

&#x200B;

Why exactly are you asking this? Curiosity? If you are wondering whether another software would make you more productive, well, the greatest boost in productivity probably comes from knowing when to use a spreadsheet and when not, ie when the task warrants the use of a proper database and/or a proper language (e.g. Python), often used together.

&#x200B;

In general, the more a task is small and one-off, the easier it is to just do it in Excel, but the more its scope grows, the related data grow, how business-critical it is, etc, then you are typically better off steering clear of Excel.",best spreadsheet editor
