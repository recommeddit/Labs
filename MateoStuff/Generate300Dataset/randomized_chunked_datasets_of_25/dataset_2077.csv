HD also sucks because (at least where I'm at) the stores are poorly managed and they change their suppliers too often. 

Both places have great deals sometimes, especially on clearance appliances.",best home improvement store

67254,"Not really. 4xx and 5xx means the server received your request, determined something went wrong in a way that the server could gracefully recover, and it successfully told you about it. Therefore, the call to `fetch` was successful, it is just returning a value which indicates a state that may be an error. It shouldn’t be up to fetch to determine what you consider an error, especially in the 4xx case. 

404 is a good example. Requesting something that doesn’t exist isn’t necessarily an error, it’s just another state.",axios alternatives reddit

15871,"Mostly two things:

* Not every brand is made for the same reason. Some are made for the every day person, some are made for people who want to spend a lot on sunglasses. Persols are fairly expensive. Most pairs would be in the $300 range. Ray bans are usually between 130 and 200. Rarely, they creep up near the $300 range. A cheap pair of Persols will cost about as much as some of the most expensive Ray Bans. So when the price is double in some cases, you can expect that quality will improve. The most comfortable pair of sunglasses I've worn (titanium oakley juliets) the guy said were $600 and they're on ebay for around that. Ray bans are closer to 1-200 and aren't as comfortable. You get what you pay for.

* Also, Maui, my top recommendation isn't made by Lux, so it explains the quality difference there. Again, overall they're more expensive than Ray bans. But, personally, I feel that Mauis are the best value in terms of quality per dollar. 

But I should have said, every brand I listed gets my recommendation. It probably sounds like ray ban hate, but I do like them. I just don't like seeing people refuse to wear anything else when there are other great brands out there.

On ray Ban repairs, it's a mixture of quantity and design. They're very popular so it'll be a popular repair. But, the wayfarers (one of their most popular styles) is prone to warp a little over time. They don't fare well in hot cars, so I bend them into place a lot. The aviators are also pretty delicate because the metal is so thin and the lens is glass, so I see a lot of people break them from dropping them or being rough on them. 

Hopefully that's a good answer, I really enjoyed that question.",best sunglasses for fashion
