37529,best amusement park,Texas’s two are pretty interchangeable imo. Fiesta is my pref but barely.
56362,best desktop monitor,"I'm honestly thinking it won't happen until the end of the year. They want to make money off their new models in bigger sizes first probably.

I watched all the youtube videos of the 48"" as desktop use and everyone eventually says it's just a bit too big and end up switching it out. I got to curb my impulse buy based on that haha"
7935,best laptop for general use,"whats with those cpu rankings?

last 5 scores recorded , i never seen an 4900 hit 21050 score on passmark but 4800 is able to go higher to 22000    
amd makes one die than binnes some for turbo speed and tdp to put in the 35W  designs   
the 4900h is just namecaling no performance behind it"
65190,best phone service company,"I would say Verizon is the best, it’s way cheaper than at&t but basically just as good, not sure about t mobile and sprint but in my area Verizon would be the best"
41125,best instrument to play,Skin flute.
29095,best calendar tool,"Try Edo Agenda! It's aesthetic and structured like a physical planner. I have tried everything, but nothing has this nice mix of note - tasks - calendar in one."

25976,best cricket teams of all time,It took me an embarrassing amount of time to realise that V. Lexington is VVS. Laxman
16661,best pet for toddlers,"I have a leopard gecko, my 2.5yo loves ""helping"" me feed crickets to her!

(This is not a recommendation of a gecko for a 3yo--Miss Elizabeth Lizard is my pet, not my kid's)."
65909,best college in california,"Stanford = Menlo nerds (they're literally down the street),
USC = rich Harvard-Westlake kids who are also legacies
Pepperdine = those richass kids who go to Harker who got too drunk in high school a lot and their parents think they'd be safer here (a dry campus),
Harvey Mudd = those kids from Arcadia who couldn't get into CalTech,
Claremont McKenna = Sage Hill kids who were too good for USC,
Pitzer = they're probably from rural california or sacramento,
Pomona = i dIDnT wAnT tO Go tO aN IvY, tHeY'Re oVErRaTeD,
Scripps = went to marlboro but lives next to loyola high. is scared of loyola high,
LMU = SoCal Catholic (Notre Dame de Namur, etc.),
Santa Clara = NorCal Catholic (St. Ignatius, etc.),
Chapman = business bros, USC rejects, and those richass kids who go to _____"
20438,best workout music,Music from the Monstercat label and synthwave.  Been listening to the Furi soundtrack a lot lately.  Toxic Avenger is so legit.
10193,best pencil for drawing,http://www.idsketching.com/thesketchlab/materials-guide/
4815,best home improvement store,"I hate them both and prefer McLendons (nw chain), but I think Lowe's has disappointed me more than HD. I have left there empty handed so many times and felt deceived other times. 

HD also sucks because (at least where I'm at) the stores are poorly managed and they change their suppliers too often. 

Both places have great deals sometimes, especially on clearance appliances."
52275,best hiphop album,"very respectable list, all of these are classics. even kendrick and danny brown's albums."
27809,best breakfast foods,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pudding

It may not sound appetising - but I promise you it's delicious."
67254,axios alternatives reddit,"Not really. 4xx and 5xx means the server received your request, determined something went wrong in a way that the server could gracefully recover, and it successfully told you about it. Therefore, the call to `fetch` was successful, it is just returning a value which indicates a state that may be an error. It shouldn’t be up to fetch to determine what you consider an error, especially in the 4xx case. 

404 is a good example. Requesting something that doesn’t exist isn’t necessarily an error, it’s just another state."
67967,best science fiction novel,It took me awhile to figure out what the hell was going on in that book. Well worth it.
10520,best suitcase lock,And real padlocks.
15871,best sunglasses for fashion,"Mostly two things:

* Not every brand is made for the same reason. Some are made for the every day person, some are made for people who want to spend a lot on sunglasses. Persols are fairly expensive. Most pairs would be in the $300 range. Ray bans are usually between 130 and 200. Rarely, they creep up near the $300 range. A cheap pair of Persols will cost about as much as some of the most expensive Ray Bans. So when the price is double in some cases, you can expect that quality will improve. The most comfortable pair of sunglasses I've worn (titanium oakley juliets) the guy said were $600 and they're on ebay for around that. Ray bans are closer to 1-200 and aren't as comfortable. You get what you pay for.

* Also, Maui, my top recommendation isn't made by Lux, so it explains the quality difference there. Again, overall they're more expensive than Ray bans. But, personally, I feel that Mauis are the best value in terms of quality per dollar. 

But I should have said, every brand I listed gets my recommendation. It probably sounds like ray ban hate, but I do like them. I just don't like seeing people refuse to wear anything else when there are other great brands out there.

On ray Ban repairs, it's a mixture of quantity and design. They're very popular so it'll be a popular repair. But, the wayfarers (one of their most popular styles) is prone to warp a little over time. They don't fare well in hot cars, so I bend them into place a lot. The aviators are also pretty delicate because the metal is so thin and the lens is glass, so I see a lot of people break them from dropping them or being rough on them. 

Hopefully that's a good answer, I really enjoyed that question."
