I guess if you're always on defense, everything looks like an attack though."
73732,best matte screen protector for ipad,"Used both the paperlike ($33 USD for two), and the supershieldz ($7 for three). I didn't personally install the paperlike, as the ipad I used already had it on. While I put the supershieldz on my own 11"".     
Even if the paperlike was cheaper, I still preferred the shieldz. Felt better, looked better. I can't go back to glass, just like writing and drawing on matte. Also fingerprints, they're not a pain in the ass."

32093,best hotel to live in,"The Ambassador in Milwaukee. We drove up on a snowy evening last year, to see a concert (Silverstein & Hawthorne Heights) - and ended up booking a hotel stay for one night because there was an awful blizzard assaulting the midwest, and we didn't want to have to drive home that night.

Turns out the Ambassador was the hotel where Jeffrey Dahmer's first murder took place. Legend has it, he cut up a boy's body, stuffed it in a duffel bag, and took it downstairs to the bar where he drank an old fashioned. So naturally, we had to have a drink down there and take all sorts of pictures to commemorate the fact that we were in such a landmark location ;)"

> What precisely do you mean by not having what it takes to be a platform?

* It doesn't expose an ""extension"" API that would help developers build a coherent UX across plugins without overlapping mappings and autocommands and stuff.
* It's still single threaded and the current implementation of ""async"" only allows to use external programs asynchronously, which is nearly useless.

> Most plugins work great and can be customized for your own benefit, however you want to map them.

No. Most plugins are poorly written and have overlapping features, thanks to the lack of API I mentioned above.

> CPU cycles - I'm not sure this is a problem since vim is so lightweight, I've never had a problem even with large projects.

Vim is single threaded so whatever you or your plugins do must wait for whatever else you or your plugins did and will block whatever you or your plugins will try to do in the near future. The recent ""async"" feature only allows running *external* commands asynchronously so vimscript, Ex commands and macros are still synchronous.

> I feel that most IDE's are bloated, with too many features you don't need.

IDEs are built to support specific needs and workflows. I'm lucky enough to not have such needs and workflows right now but I did, before, and may do one day, and you can bet your ass I will just use the right tool for the job.

> You can basically create an IDE from vim just by extending it's functionality via plugins.

No. You can create something that looks like an IDE if you squint hard enough."

I just didn’t connect the dots because I was thinking more contemporary. Seriously, Anne if Green Gables is the reason I am a “reader” Did she write anything else besides that main series?"
65221,best phone service company,"Stetson,

Thanks for your work.  I think you should add USMobile Pooled plans.  They really change the game for low data users.  $9 for unlimited talk and text + $2/GB data.  The fact that one can add data as needed in the middle of month is wonderful.  For us retirees two lines with 1 GB pooled data per month costs only $10.49 per month.  How can that be beat on Verizon network?"
30198,best Mexican war to study,To me it was taught like the Mexicans were being stubborn and wouldn’t agree to the Texas border. And when Texas petitioned to be annexed as a state by the US it pissed off the Mexicans. And then whoever was president sent troops there knowing some would be killed by Mexicans as an excuse to start a war. I think he wanted to start a war in order to obtain more land from the Mexicans our west on top of setting the Texas border at the rio grande. So basically the Mexicans were being stubborn and wouldn’t agree to the Mexican border. Then the Americans went and enforced this and used it as an excuse for the Mexicans to cede us a lot of territory.
