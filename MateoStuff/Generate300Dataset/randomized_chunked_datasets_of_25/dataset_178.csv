14423,best romantic novel,"1. Bringing down the duke by Evie Dunmore 
2. A Rogue of ones own by Evie Dunmore 
3. The simple wild by KA tucker 
4. The idea of you by robinne lee 
5. A kingdom of dreams by Judith McNaught 

I definitely think my favorite books usually do NOT involve insta love and the relationship is developed over  time. The stakes to be together must be high as well! I usually prefer a good amount of angst and emotional turmoil. Hero can be grumpy/rakish but ultimately sweet and tender. 

It’s hard to do a top 5 so my additional favorites: tempt me by twilight, devil in winter, love in the afternoon... all by Lisa Kleypas. She delivers the most swoon worthy hero’s and strong heroines!"
