29081,best calendar tool,"I really like aCalendar which has lots of great calendar views and a sleek reminder. Also, it's done by a small German company which I find worth supporting. Works great with Google Calendar or other calendars by just hooking up with the Android calendar.

I use Outlook and the Outlook App to sync the calendar but find it too simple."
65298,best phone service company,This is helpful. One tiny suggestion: could you put all data caps in the same format? So 500MB as 0.5GB? It would make sorting cleaner.

200,best terminal file manager reddit,"Not completely relevant here, but for anyone using Android who likes this sort of thing there is a file manager called Total Commander that is excellent."
4663,best home improvement store,"Honestly it will be region and sometimes store specific. 

When I was in NC Lowes had better lumber but here in NoVA HD has better lumber. 

I buy a lot of other items at lowes due to pricematch/10% off but HD has better thinset (glue for tiles) in their Flexbond. 

So for me I shop at both depending on what I need and price point. I would say Lowes wins out more than HD. But HD has some items better."

33588,best electric car,"ID4 might be one of the best ""price for car"" vehicle. To see ""real life"" small turning circle in action really show what this vehicle can do.  0-60 in 7.3 seconds isn't bad.  And for another $3680, you can get AWD that does 0-60 in 5.7 seconds.  I think the comparison to Model Y is fair.  Model Y certainly is a better performing vehicle and have some other advantages ie. supercharging network, UI, longer range, etc. Those that can't afford to or just simply don't want to pay $53690 (including destination) + TTL, then ID4 is not a bad alternative: some advantages with ID4: better ride quality, blind spot monitor on mirrors, higher ground clearance, tighter turning circle, free fast charging at EA for 3 years, etc.  So it depends what a person wants."
22993,best celebrity,"Bruce Willis.

I was a NYC taxi driver and i pick him up at a restaurant very late at night. He starts asking me all these questions about the long hours, how much a good cabbie makes a night, etc.

He asks me if I am married, I say yes, asks about my wife. I tell him marriage is great but we aren't together much due to the long hours i drive the cab.

We get to his place, hands me $1,000 and says, ""Now go take a week off and spend it with your wife.""

True story."
45815,best trick or treating candy,"Best: Midnight Milky Way bars. On halloween, they're like the unicorns of candies. My grandmother had those and her house was #2 for halloween pickings on our street.

Worst: Those [strawberry candies](http://cdn.nuts.com/images/auto/510x340/assets/a914dbc3f13e1f1c.jpg) that taste like stale, dusty fruit and seem to appear mysteriously in candy bowls. That's what disappointment tastes like. Or those mini bags of M&Ms--what's the point? They hold like 5 chocolate bits total, that's clearly not enough to surpass even mini chocolate bars."

49062,best gaming monitor,"EDIT: it's a shame that none of the reviews I have seen/read mentioned any of these points and I have seen everything that was available at the time: youtubers, websites, you name it.

I have AORUS AD27QD. Certainly would not buy again for the following reasons:

* the triangular type stand the gaming monitors have these days are ridiculous. It's just ergonomically bad. I don't care for the ""space"" look or whatever they were going for.
* I thought the ability to control screen settings from Windows level was a cool feature. But implementation is so bad that it makes it almost useless. If you create a profile in ~~shitkick~~ sidekick software, as soon as you change something through the monitor OSD, all goes to shit, you lose all your settings.
* Contrast turned out to be average at best (measured using screen calibration hardware). Some reviews claimed it to be really good, was one of the reasons I got it.
* Headphones noise cancelling - works but:
   * you lose audio quality if you want to use a headset. Not input but output i.e. if you connect headphones to the screen, the audio quality is poor.
   * you have to disconnect anything from the USB in the screen if you want to use noise cancelling. This is because the mic will register constant high pitch noise .
* USB ports are placed in a really bad spot. I had Dells and HPs and they all had USBs on the side - easily accessible but not here. It's easier to dive under the desk to plug something in than finding USB on Aorus.
* Quality is not great - I already have issues with the USB port disconnecting and I only had this screen for not even a year. It's breaking despite the fact that I have a USB extension so that I don't constantly plug/unplug things.
* Screen seems to get confused if two devices are connected and you turn off one or unplug one. But maybe all screens have this problem, don't know.

Overall, the panel is good and all but this product falls apart at functionality/ergonomics level + is overpriced for what it is."

Great tactical JRPG with a unique steampunk setting and gunplay which you rarely see in these games.."
48984,best gaming monitor,"Hey check out the tftcentral review as well! I bought the vg27aq on sale in Australia and love it but admit it's not the best at lower refresh rates so if you play console or any games that'll drive your fps down to the 60-80 range consider that!

I haven't experienced the LG myself but when doing due dilligence on other people's experiences it seems the LG is more consistent across different fps and refresh rates"

There are workarounds the f2p part and as much as i shit on the game, the grinding for me is actually balanced. Not too long to feel grindy"
