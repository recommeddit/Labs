10109,best pencil for drawing,"Basically all of this, same background and on my way up. All of my sketching paper is from dollar-store type places and I have rolls upon rolls of those MÅLA drawing paper rolls from Ikea because they're like $5 for 30 meters of paper and are very versatile in how you want to use them (I've used them because they have great dimensions for croquis and because I can tape sheets of them onto my walls so I can write and draw ideas down for projects.) It's a bit like starting out running or doing exercise. For the first long while you don't really need any fancy gear, all your shoes and clothes need to do is not get in your way of achieving results."

It was $58 a night but felt like it should have been twice that."

56209,best action and adventure movie,">I suppose you could argue that the classiest form of action film is the adventure film, where a lot of the ""action"" is more cerebral. Lawrence of Arabia comes to mind

I love *Lawrence of Arabia*, but its not really an action film. To quote is co-star Omar Sharif, the film had ""no action, really, if you come to think of it"", and he's right. 

Whenever there's a potential for an action sequence, Lean plays it up less as fighting and more as a crowd scene: its not *action*, its *spectacle*. Indeed, during development, he encouraged his writers to downplay the fighting, asking sarcastically ""do we really want to make a western?!""

As for ""adventure"", it kind of is and kind of isn't. When O'Toole read an early draft he told Lean ""its the most marvellous adventure story"", to which Lean responded: ""Its *that* bad?"""
