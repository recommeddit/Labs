1658,best ice cream flavor,Raspberry cran lemon sherb sounds delightful. Well they all do. How does the uncooked cookie dough work with the ice cream?
36136,best alcoholic drink,"Gin and Squirt (the soda, not female ejaculation)."
30089,best money managing app,"Switched to YNAB myself (after 20+ years of Quicken) a couple of months ago. It's worth every penny. Major shift in thinking about money, and a great mobile experience."

72461,best keyboard switches,"Oh sorry I missed that part, I can't say because I've never tried them with lube"
25381,best spiderman actor,"1. Tobey because he's truly the embodiment of the early Lee Ditko Parker. The guy who gets bullied before getting his powers. Would be great if we explored his Highschool years more but that's just a nitpick because he graduates after 28 Issues anyways.

2. Tom in Civil War because on how he was written bar the Stark BS (but overall it has to be Andrew rn.)

3. Tobey no question.

4. Andrew no question.

5. Tobey no question.

6. Andrew best actor of the 3 tbh.

7. Tobey had not only his true love but she was written extremely well in those 3 movies.

8. Tobey no question.

9. Andrew because the death of Gwen was executed so breathtakingly good, although the movie is still the worst Spider-Man movie of all time.

10. Tobey, I mean it's freaking Elfman!

11. Tom/Tobey. Tom, just because he's fits the role of a (28 issue Highschool) kid but Tobey is actually a more fitting role for an adult Peter."
17051,best iOS game,"There are certain games I just love playing on the touchscreen, like Civ 6. It is just so good in the iPad Pro. I wonder if that‚Äôs the case for Northgard too - I‚Äôm more tempted to get it on iOS"
41156,best instrument to play,"The vast majority of rock bands do not use keyboards.  Simply a statement of fact.  Drums, guitar and bass are clearly the primary instruments in a rock band.  Also, notice that I said *""for the most part""* which clearly indicates that there are some rock bands that use keys. 

**Pay attention.**"
58410,best cologne,You are going to have to go to the store and try different scents out. What smells good on someones boyfriend might not on you because of individual body odour.
62880,Best Data Science textbook,"I'm interested in what people will say, but honestly, old-school books (don't get me wrong, I love them) haven't really been the foundation or the propagation of my career in data science. My data science journey semi-officially began when I picked up bioinformatics in college. All of my bioinformatics textbooks in college were (free, yay!) open-source online texts - it generally takes \~7+ years for information to go to hard copy print, and what we were working on was far too cutting edge for that. Currently the only data science resource I actively pay for is Datacamp. Just about everything else I use lives on the internet for free (maybe I give a nominal donation to the author.)

Data science touches tons of other fields, though. I love traditional textbooks for some more established and less rapidly changing fields like statistics, calculus, old-school microbiology basics, well known medical knowledge, geology, etc etc. I'm happy to offer some recommendations if you point me toward some specific other fields."
65419,best phone service company,"This is not bad, but the EIN/business requirement doesn't make it a valid option for tourists or those who aren't US residents.

At least all of the options in this list is available for those regardless of citizenship."
60390,Best comedy show on Netflix,"No problem, btw club of crows is in Spanish but it's quite funny if you don't mind subtitles (or speak Spanish yourself), it's about a soccer team but it's really about the rich kids who inherited the team from the father and have no idea how to run it, very funny in the vein of arrested development or always sunny, i.e. Shows about bad things happening to terrible people."

31254,best country to live in,"The only correct answer... fuck these whining ass America haters.... you don‚Äôt like it, fucking move !"
27713,best bollywood actor,"Damn, dude. That was an intense and almost painful read as I thought it was a RIP post. I know he was hospitalised sometime back and thought the worst when I glanced at this post.

Please start with HBD the next time. *phew*

Also, he's a legend."

28994,best breakfast foods,Eggs Benny or Chicken & Waffles
54515,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"I had otsu v2 in every softness! I found mid to be quite fast, not very cozy and I wasn't a fan. Xsoft is very nice, but got my arm a little sweaty sometimes due to just sinking in. Soft was just right for me.

If you want to try something a little slower, but with more control and something unique, otsu v2 is awesome! If you really want to slow down, then go zero üëç."
4123,best online college,"I doubt you'll find something accredited that's cheaper than an in-state Kansas school with a strong online component.
