23019,"My first celebrity experience when I first moved to LA was meeting Weird Al Yankovich.  He came in to eat at the restaurant I was hosting at and while his date was in the bathroom before they left he was was sitting in this lounging area we had.  Being all of 18 and thinking I was playing it cool I asked ""So, you working on anything new?"" like I knew him personally or something.

He just kind of shrugged and said not really and was followed by another 40 seconds or so of awkward silence.  He wasn't rude or nice; it was obvious he wasn't in the mood though.  Which I totally get now nearly two decades later.",best celebrity

25750,"Different countries have different conditions which suit different types of players. Pitches in the subcontinent are better for batting and spinners, not so good for fast bowlers. Unsurprisingly, India and Sri Lanka are known for their batsmen and spinners. Then we have an anomaly - Pakistan. They have the same kinds of pitches, suitable for batsmen and spinners. But they constantly produce incredible fast bowlers, one after another. 

Australia and South Africa always have great all round teams. Great fast bowlers and great batsmen. 

New Zealand is known for great fielding, mostly because we've often been a bit crap at batting and bowling. 

The West Indies destroyed teams in the 70s and 80s with an incredible selection of deadly fast bowlers, including a guy with the best nickname ever - Whispering Death. These days they're unfortunately nowhere near the same level but still have the ability to surprise.",best cricket teams of all time
