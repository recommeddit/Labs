60227,best freezer brand,"Awesome, thanks for the tips.  I've made my share of chicken soup before, but never in such large bulk amounts for the purpose of canning.  I do have 1 duck, but she's a pet.  That girl is safe from the pot.  :)"
70458,best major to study in college,"I took business major Financial Accounting I, and to date it's the only class I've ever taken where the instructor just constantly ragged on the subject for being boring.

It was actually kind of funny, but then also not because attendance was mandatory.  I watched a lot of March Madness and The Wire in that class"
14024,best place to get free books,"On my samsung it's ""my files"""
64770,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"My wife is from SB (her family is still there so we go back at least 3x a year). We both currently live in NYC. Here are the spots I always hit up when we go there:

1. [Mony's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/monys-mexican-food-santa-barbara) for Mexican food. They have great al pastor. This is food you 100% can not find at any price level/quality in NYC. Trust me, we've tried. We had them cater our pre-wedding dinner, it is that good. 

2. Los Agaves also really good, they are a bit pricier and ""nicer"" than Mony's. 

2. The Habit for a decent burger. It is more backyard style when compared to something like Shake Shack. 

3. I'll defer to the other posts for sushi/uni. High end sushi experience is better in NYC but there is nothing like fresher product in CA. 

4. Cold Spring Tavern for tri-tip sandwiches. You can't get a proper tri-tip cut from even some of the best butchers in NYC. 

I saw recommendation for Finch and Fork. I'd avoid, you'd just feel slightly ripped off."

10175,best pencil for drawing,"Musgrave did not make many pencils for themselves before. It is good to see them sticking to classic designs while making new products, especially in 2019/2020 when most U.S. pencil companies might as well have been considered dead. 

The only Musgrave pencil I have is the Harvest #1. I found some [Standard Issue Supplies No. 2](https://designworksink.com/collections/pens-pencils/products/58e51c0e1b10e3709ea7025f) pencils that look and feel like Musgrave pencils (and they write like if the Harvest had a 2B option). SIS is also based in Tennessee, according to what I read, which makes me believe it even more that they are made by Musgrave.

 I plan to get the Bugle, Ceres, Tennessee Red, Harvest Professional, and News 600 pencils. I am a big fan of the traditional lettering and stylized fonts they use.

Many US pencil manufactures make a lot of pencils for other brands, and do not always make many of their own. Moon Product's website looks like a joke, and  General's makes many pencils that mostly feel and look the same (and are pretty cheap, both in price and build). Musgrave looks like the only serious US competitor in the pencil market."
26766,best board games,I hear Caverna is more samey (no random element with cards). Would you really consider it a strict upgrade?
73727,best matte screen protector for ipad,Thanks for posting. I’m going to give it a shot.
28474,best breakfast foods,Poptarts and beer
44955,best items under $100,"I can't have a electric blanket anymore. I toss and turn a lot and about 15 or so years ago, when one was on my bed it started smoking and burning because it got twisted when I tossed and turned. So no I won't get a electric blanket ever again. That's okay though because I have a cat who likes to snuggle under the blankets with me and we keep each other warm."
36442,best alcoholic drink,It blew my mind to find out how much sugar was in tonic.  I had figured it was more or less lightly flavored soda water.  Boy was I wrong
55980,best action and adventure movie,"Frankly, Dan Trachtenberg is probably the first director that I actually am confident can pull it off. Neil Burger, David O. Russell, and Shawn Levy? Not so much."
41279,best instrument to play,I really like the sound of the erhu.
25093,best spiderman actor,"That scene was perfect, I don't understand why nobody liked it. He was a nerd that now became ""cool"", that's what he thought being cool was. It was clearly a joke, look how all the women he boops look back at him."
31865,best hotel to live in,"Only stayed at Royal Pacific, others have mentioned most of the pros but military and veterans can get bumped up to club level which includes snacks and meals throughout the day as well as passes to the gym."
26603,best board games,The style of game is very different though. Carcassonne is about territory control. Isle of Skye is about objectives and the market mechanic.
43765,best items under $100,Okay maybe not the best but a $20 plant light so I can keep real plants during the winter. There’s just something refreshing about having plant life surround you during the darker months of the year. You just have to be careful if you have pets to make sure they’re not toxic to them!
3028,best webcamera,"Even if you're not serious, if your phone isn't junk, it probably will do better video quality than a webcam.  And if you have a nice phone, you can get surprisingly decent quality from it if you bother with decent lighting and all that tangential stuff."
40757,best instrument to play,"I know trumpet and voice, but I prefer voice because I know how to sing by ear, and it's really easy for me to find stuff I like to sing that's made in the 21st Century, [especially made in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08wDeWQqWnw). Trumpet? Not so much outside hits"
73126,best Linux distro,"Because it is based on Arch, it is a lovely user friendly distro. However, the administration of their forum is terrible, you will get banned just because you ask a question and ask them WHY."
49631,best gaming monitor,"What's a decent 32"" gaming monitor that doesn't cost 5 Bitcoin though?"
10668,best suitcase lock,Locks keep honest people out.
