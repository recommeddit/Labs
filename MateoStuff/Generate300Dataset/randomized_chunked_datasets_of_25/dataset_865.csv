- **Versace The Dreamer:** This one's for me and me alone, I know it's divisive :)
- **Prada Luna Rossa Carbon:** When I don't want to think about what to wear
- **Hermes Eau de Rhubarbe Écarlate:** When I want to feel relaxed, indoors or outdoors
- **MFK Aqua Celestia Forte:** S/S all-rounder
- **Nishane Ani:** F/W all-rounder

Especially tough picking Aqua Celestia Forte for S/S, I like Nishane Wulong Cha and Silver Mountain Water too.",best cologne

Also, Apple sources high quality displays for their iPhones, both in terms of LCDs and OLEDs. I imagine the higher end screens are a bit less susceptible to burn in.

Source: replaced a screen on my old iPhone 5s with a third party. That screen was *very* inferior.",best iPhone

He was so nice, bought everyone in the bar multiple rounds of shots, picked up tabs, and was just partying with everyone. Tipped us very generously, then when we re-opened our kitchen to make his lady friend a snack (fries and mac n' cheese), he gave our cook $100. He was joking around with us, and remembered my name when he came back in after filming his show with all the other sportscasters. YAY CHARLES!",best celebrity

12089,"I would say not to do this. Here's the reason and some examples.

If someone is really into something, there's probably a very specific item that they want. Depending on what it is that they're ""into"" there may be different products out there with varying levels of quality. Best to leave it to the expert to figure out what they want in this case.

Example: my brothers and I like to play disc golf. My aunt and uncle know this and got us all some discs at Target or Walmart or something. I really appreciate the thought, but those discs sit in my bedroom unused and will likely never ever get used. They are cheap, very lightweight discs that would probably break the first time they hit a tree. 

Example 2: my fiancée knows I love the guitar. She asked me once for my birthday what *specifically* I wanted that I didn't have and I told her ""a good noise gate"". She had no idea what that meant but she was able to go to a guitar store and ask the professionals there. Yes it was guitar center but she ended up getting me an ISP Decimator which is pretty much exactly what I wanted.

So my point is if someone is ""into"" something don't just guess at what they want. They probably have special tastes or very specific preferences.",best gifts for dad
