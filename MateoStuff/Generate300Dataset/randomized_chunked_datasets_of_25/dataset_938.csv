58737,"Quick question, you say don't alternate scents across short periods of time.  Does that include across seasons?  Or would you recommend having a more 'summer' one for the spring/summer and a more 'fall' one for the fall/winter?  Thanks, sorry I'm very new to this!",best cologne
6883,"Very nice summary. Typing from a 6S, I agree with everything you said.

Nonetheless, you got the “Hey Siri” thing wrong. The 6S was the first iPhone to be able to listen continuously for the “Hey Siri” command even while unplugged. Other iOS devices could use “Hey Siri” too, but only while using the charger.

I would also say that even if iOS 13 (and presumably iOS 14) is really fluid on the 5 year old 6S, you can feel it really isn’t optimized for it because of the heating and battery problems that it suffers since iOS 11. But still, it is astonishing how well it runs it.",best iPhone

50803,"That’s a good comparison on levels of fame. I liked Meek A LOT more earlier on. Radio show freestyles after being up for 2-3 days straight. Fun to hear them. Dreams Worth More Than Money was the last CD of his I purchased. Kinda fell off after that.

Dave East still has plenty of time to make good and become more relevant. Sometimes fame is a curse though. I loved Kevin Gates, then he came out with his first commercial album and his sound went south (not geographically).",best rap album
