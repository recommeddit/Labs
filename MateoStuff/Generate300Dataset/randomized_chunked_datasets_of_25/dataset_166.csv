47801,"Imo don’t waste the money. Use tools for your phone/pc which will do a better job and stick to a scientific calculator. A lot of college courses won’t let you use graphing calculators on tests. So far I’ve had one class in two years who would allow one. 

Casio has a ~$15 scientific calculator with natural display, nonCAS equation solvers, with solve vector math, systems, definite integration/differentiation, etc. great calculator allowed on pretty much all standardized testing. Also runs on solar and is smaller in size as an added bonus.
