55913,best action and adventure movie,"I'll be honest, I enjoyed At World's End too. It was almost like a Game of Thrones style sequal. Lots of different characters, alliances, betrayals, death, plot twists, etc. Plus the music was some of my favorite in the series."
8937,best toothpaste,"""The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white.""
Sorry for the wiki reference... :S , but I just think the cultural norm should be ""your teeth look best when they're natural!"""

34904,best NFL player,"It would be disrespectful for a QB with 51 total touchdowns and single digit turnovers to not win MVP

That has never happened before, Rodgers was a lock. If Rivers didn’t win it in 2008, Watson wasn’t going to win in 2020 even with a playoff berth"
33346,best electric car,"Most modern ICE vehicles however will run 100k miles without any real issues quite easily. 

PHEV is a good middleground and a good way to make the switch for many people. It's a good car for someone who only wants one vehicle but also wants to get into electric."
19530,best YouTube video,Second Lindsay Ellis. She rocks! Love her video essays on story telling. Love the deeper dives into why movies were made the way they were due to culture. Wish she was able to do more.
23836,best car racing video game,"This.  Forza Horizon 4 is splendid and the 5th one comes out in November, this franchise is the greatest car racing series as far as customization and driving fun are concerned.  You can make any vehicle do any type of race, create your own races from scratch, take any vehicle off road and just drive around free roam, keep your cars stock or supe them up to the max and still be able to do any race with them with the other drivers scaling to that car's class.  It's a truly great racing game, from someone who has been playing them since Cruisin' the USA and Beetle Adventure Racing on N64.  Switch doesn't have anything nearly as good, unfortunately."
54431,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"My hien was my first pad, just received the zero and hayate otsu v2. I can tell the hayate b/c the surface is sort of like the Hien, but I swear to god the zero is faster. A gentle flick on my Hien gets it from edge to center, same flick more or less pushes my mouse off of the pad altogether."
31060,best country to live in,"Not really, though it depends what you mean by extreme? Temperature-wise, it's very mild - average temperature is 2 degrees celcius (36 degrees F) in December. 
The hardest thing can be the short days in winter - the shortest has 7 hours between sunrise and sunset, while the longest in the summer has about 18."
53406,best usb c charging cable,Fair enough. This was around 2014/15 so I’m sure their quality could’ve changed for the better recently.
12314,best gifts for mom,"Northern Brewer is a well known, high quality retailer and online store for homebrewers. Definitely one of the better ones out there. Since you're in their area, I'd suggest a visit to the shop and talk to them and get suggestions on what to get her - ingredients and equipment.

Just to set your expectations, $30 is probably just for an ingredient kit. You'll also need equipment, so budget about $150 for a starter set. Definitely hit up /r/homebrewing though - lots of advanced stuff, but a ton of beginner info too.

It's a hell of a fun hobby :) I love making beer! I started right about when my son was born because I knew I was going to have about seven weeks off of work to help take care of him, and I also made a bunch of beer.

It was a really special event on his first birthday to drink a year old porter that I made the day before he was born."
27608,best bollywood actor,"I can recognize that he’s attractive but he’s not my type. Maybe it’s the hooded eyes? Idk

Edit: why am I getting downvoted for my personal preference lol?"
54663,best water filter,I agree with the Berkey love. I've had mine for over a year now it produces great water. I convinced my parents to get one too and they love it. It's a higher initial investment compared to typical filters but the solid carbon block will last a lot longer and actually filter out contaminants.
36264,best alcoholic drink,"I love Jager-Bombs. Like, I love and respect them so much that I completely stay the fuck away from them."
32239,best hotel to live in,"I've left the 'do not disturb' sign on the door all day because I wanted a quiet day alone, and around 4PM housekeeping plus a manager came and knocked to do a welfare check for this exact reason. 

Note that I've spent a lot of time in hotels and have only had that happen once, but it makes sense I guess."

57942,best cologne,Polo Blue is great. It smells so good I almost want to wear it myself.
33414,best electric car,"Considering the Hummer EV will start at $115,000 until 2024, I seriously doubt they'll be flying off the lot. Who wants to take a gamble on a first edition GM EV truck for $115k? Tesla got away with this by being a disruptor and having sleek styling, autopilot, etc, but GM isn't exactly known for quality or risk taking. 

I hope they have success with this but I bet they'll half-ass it like they do with almost everything else in the tradition of big, old, bloated corporations and it won't see much success."
