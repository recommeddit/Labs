"For drivers in the US, a AAA membership is only like $55. Even if your car runs great it's a good thing to have. Shit like running out of gas, or locking your keys in your car can happen all of the time. And they even come out for you when it isn't even *your car* . Like, if your buddy is giving you a ride and they get a flat, they'll come out and hook you up. I've called them for complete strangers before. And oh my god, in an accident they're a life saver.

They also have a bunch of other cool random benefits, like cheap hotel rooms, and all kinds of help with travel plans, and you can go there instead of the DMV for certain things like your registration. It's soooo much nicer than the DMV and takes like 10 minutes.  

I've also never in my life have felt ripped off, or like they offered something that they didn't deliver, or that it wasn't worth the money. I swear, for drivers it's the best $55 you can spend all year."
Thanks for the clarification.

"But let's be honest, I'm not sure I could sit through another half movie self discovery Spiderman... I like that they threw him in boots on the ground picking up where civil war left off. And it give the MCU even more fluidity as a moving universe."
Nature's website has really good ones that come out weekly and cover a variety of topics.
"I'm totally going to be an asshat and mention the subreddit I created. [/r/Sciencelounge](http://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceLounge/) is for scientists, grad students, whoever is working directly in science. 

We have a lot of humor here that doesn't get let out and no real subreddit to do it in. Come share your frustrations, stories, jokes, ""nailed it"" triumphs, whatever. 

Maybe we don't need it, but I personally feel like I would love a place where I can casually talk about stuff that only we get."
"You're so lucky she actually asked for something instead of saying ""nothing"" and getting pissed at what you get (or don't get) her."
"Hands down: [Who says you cannot get published?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2492027/) References papers like: ""Will humans swim faster or slower in syrup?""

I forgot about this game till you wrote it here. This is a goodie for sure.

"Chris Coons (D-DE)

I got the chance to meet him for about an hour when I was in DC. The first thing I asked him was where his body guards (I had never seen a senator before.) He just laughed and spent a decent amount of time talking to me and my dad (he went to college with him). He didn't even expect/want to win his race until a tea party nutcase upset the established Republican that was going to cruise to victory."

"I'm using the current population numbers to compare the relative size of countries. It's just to illustrate how  difficult it is for smaller countries to win. I'm sure some other countries had much lower populations as well at some point when they won the World Cup, but that wasn't really my point."
"As a Graphic Design major with a very comfortable salary and recruiters knocking on my door, these list are funny."
"I don't read this sort of advice as ""do something you hate"", but avoid the *trap* of major in some subject just because you like it.  That's fantastically bad advice for a whole host of reasons 

* low skill level.  I have an interest in chemistry.  I'm not that good at it.  Me taking out huge loans to major in chemistry is going nowhere.

* low demand for that skill.  For example, very few people hire philosophers, so you can get really good at that, and still not have the job later.  

* need for a particular set of soft skills to really be successful.  You can't be a good salesman if you aren't outgoing and charismatic.  It just doesn't happen.  You can't be a good accountant if you aren't extremely detailed.  You can't be a good artist if you lack entrepreneurial skills (because your work is its own small business).  

* the job might require sacrifices that you can't afford to make.  The high end jobs are mostly in coastal cities.  If you can't or won't move there, you might as well forget about it.  Google isn't going to have you telecommute from rural Alabama.  And some jobs require huge commitment-- 80 hour weeks, being on call, etc.  if you don't want that, you can't be in that industry.  

* the environment might not be good.  You can't expect to work the trades without lifting heavy things and working outside.  You can't expect to spend lots of time outdoors if you're a secretary.  You can't expect alone time in retail, or lots of socializing in forestry."
"Well, my family has always played cribbage (both sides) and I learned when I was like 6. Anyway my parents are divorced and my dad moved out of town so I'd see him a few times a year at most. but every time I'd see him we'd play cribbage. So a year or two ago I made him a cribbage board. It was pretty special I got this gorgeous redwood (paduca) and chiseled out a place for cards and pegs when you opened it. I made it all myself and it took nearly 2 weeks but he loved it. It was tied to something we both loved and did together as well as handcrafted. He has said more than once it is one of his most prized possessions."
"This is the only one I can vouch for but I’m sure they all smell amazing! And if I remember correctly, it lasts quite awhile too.
