52986,"I like every tape that Odd has put out, but cLOUDDEAD will always be special for me the same way that College Dropout was. Moreso than any of their later projects I think that album had the most specific killer tone for that phase of my life. The dreamy, drunken flow from one thing to the next with the entire project feeling hopelessly lost with how much information they try to cover. 

Discovered that album when I was drifting between college classes feeling like a corpse/colossal fuckup. So much of the lyricism on that album stuck to me as somebody who had always been in love with hip hop flow/beats but didn't relate to the subject matter much at all due to my whiteness and disconnect from either coastal region culture. 

When I got older and more exposed to other people telling their stories I found more to relate to in traditional hip hop but for a long time cLOUDDEAD was my shit. 

There's something

To the fading of faith

My whole childhood

Was the broken guitar

And my sister's silly

Yellow blanket

Now I carry

Slender and sexy curved

Sledge hammers

To break the bricks

I bought

I should have never went to college

But took a trip to Costa Rica

To cut rainforests

To choke myself



Damn that shit brings back memories.",best hiphop album

53002,"That's a goodlooking list you have there. Ah that's difficult and it'll undoubtedly change tomorrow (big fan of making lists anyway).

Atmosphere - when life gives you lemons you paint that shit gold. Not a weak track, relatable topics and excellent story telling.

Aesop Rock - labor days. My introduction to Aesop, had never heard anything like it before and was blown away.

Gangstarr - moment of truth. Guru and Premier, can't mess with the combination. Even at 20 tracks there's no misses.

Talib Kweli - quality. The early Kanye productions, the urgency and now reminding me of simpler times.

P.O.S. - never better. Not as gritty as Audition and not as electronic and hardcore as we don't even live here, but just blew me away.",best hiphop album
5676,"I'm making really good money right now with just HTML/CSS/very minimal JS /WordPress. I'm almost done my degree in CompSci, but I had never worked on them before a few months ago. 

Zero professional experience in programming before this. There's jobs out there, just have to look hard and write good proposals.

I've found you can pick up a lot of shit on the fly. I'm working in bootstrap right now despite having never learned it. 

I don't know how hard it would be if you've never done any programming before.",best programming language for web development

12520,My mom was looking really hard for a watch but couldn't decide on her own what to get. I'd gone with her to a few places and knew pretty much what she wanted based on what she'd said when she tried stuff on. I knew she would have been happy enough picking out her own watch but I found one that she claims is more perfect than anything she could have picked out. And more she can make the joke that she thinks about me all the time when she sees it.,best gifts for mom
