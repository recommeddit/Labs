52986,best hiphop album,"I like every tape that Odd has put out, but cLOUDDEAD will always be special for me the same way that College Dropout was. Moreso than any of their later projects I think that album had the most specific killer tone for that phase of my life. The dreamy, drunken flow from one thing to the next with the entire project feeling hopelessly lost with how much information they try to cover. 

Discovered that album when I was drifting between college classes feeling like a corpse/colossal fuckup. So much of the lyricism on that album stuck to me as somebody who had always been in love with hip hop flow/beats but didn't relate to the subject matter much at all due to my whiteness and disconnect from either coastal region culture. 

When I got older and more exposed to other people telling their stories I found more to relate to in traditional hip hop but for a long time cLOUDDEAD was my shit. 

There's something

To the fading of faith

My whole childhood

Was the broken guitar

And my sister's silly

Yellow blanket

Now I carry

Slender and sexy curved

Sledge hammers

To break the bricks

I bought

I should have never went to college

But took a trip to Costa Rica

To cut rainforests

To choke myself



Damn that shit brings back memories."
17288,best iOS game,Thank you. Played them all including on the Nintendo DS. Love them!!!!!
37324,best amusement park,Definitely better for enthusiasts but not as broad of an appeal as Knotts.
52058,best iphone case,Did you ever find a case? I am now looking for something that allows my phone to sit completely flat as well. Was wondering what you went with. or any good runner ups?
65717,best college in california,Davis is above both UCSB and Irvine on every rankings website.
42207,movies like Inception,"When you contrast their roles in this film with their roles in Star Wars TFA, you can really see their range"
10809,best suitcase lock,"Feel smug that you know ""the man"" searched your bag.

... which you consented to when you checked it."
65198,best phone service company,Wouldn't Sprint be the worst? I've heard of so many who have switched away from them recently.
53002,best hiphop album,"That's a goodlooking list you have there. Ah that's difficult and it'll undoubtedly change tomorrow (big fan of making lists anyway).

Atmosphere - when life gives you lemons you paint that shit gold. Not a weak track, relatable topics and excellent story telling.

Aesop Rock - labor days. My introduction to Aesop, had never heard anything like it before and was blown away.

Gangstarr - moment of truth. Guru and Premier, can't mess with the combination. Even at 20 tracks there's no misses.

Talib Kweli - quality. The early Kanye productions, the urgency and now reminding me of simpler times.

P.O.S. - never better. Not as gritty as Audition and not as electronic and hardcore as we don't even live here, but just blew me away."
5676,best programming language for web development,"I'm making really good money right now with just HTML/CSS/very minimal JS /WordPress. I'm almost done my degree in CompSci, but I had never worked on them before a few months ago. 

Zero professional experience in programming before this. There's jobs out there, just have to look hard and write good proposals.

I've found you can pick up a lot of shit on the fly. I'm working in bootstrap right now despite having never learned it. 

I don't know how hard it would be if you've never done any programming before."

56232,best action and adventure movie,Came here to say this. No other answer
12520,best gifts for mom,My mom was looking really hard for a watch but couldn't decide on her own what to get. I'd gone with her to a few places and knew pretty much what she wanted based on what she'd said when she tried stuff on. I knew she would have been happy enough picking out her own watch but I found one that she claims is more perfect than anything she could have picked out. And more she can make the joke that she thinks about me all the time when she sees it.
35907,best alcoholic drink,"YouTube is blocked at work, so I can't see what you posted, but I hope it's the relevant Michell and Webb ""ever so slightly drunk"" sketch."
20187,best workout music,Parkway Drive - Sleepwalker
52326,best hiphop album,">	But eminem being top 5 ever is an iron clad fact.

It really isn’t though. It’s an opinion."
54004,best medicine for a cold,"I can verify from personal experience.  When I feel a cold coming on, I take a ton of vitamin C (5-6 pills, many times the recommended daily dose) and ONE dose of Zinc.  That usually helps mitigate the oncoming cold, and keeps it from slipping into bronchitis for me.  Doesn't do anything when the cold's already hit, though."
44754,best items under $100,Yes! I was a bit concerned but I’ve only had it since December and I’ve definitely saved that much already between weekly groceries and points.

72458,best keyboard switches,"Nice, do you recommend lubibg them? I felt like the Pinks were slightly more directionally what I wanted but the yellows are so close."
48956,best gaming monitor,"I also got a LG 27GL83a during one of the sales.  In my opinion, for most people the 27GL83a is the one to go.  I wrote up [a brief comparison of that and the 27GL850 in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapclounge/comments/gio3n3/review_of_27gl83ab_and_differences_between_27gl850/)  Basically, the 27GL850 is good if you do photo editing because of a slightly higher color gamut.  Most people can't tell the difference though."
