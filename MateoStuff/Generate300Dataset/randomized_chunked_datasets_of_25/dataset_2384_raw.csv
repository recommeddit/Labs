"Festen.

Also, as a TV series I have found Dead To Me really well plotted, and able to find multiple surprise endings throughout the series."
Canadian government just voted in bill C-51. More or less the Patriot act of Canada.
"You forgot Sci-Hub.

LibGen is also great for textbooks. You can get just about any edition of the popular textbooks for major classes, in searchable PDF format."
Hells yes.
Funny you say that. One of my coworkers watched in on a flight and fucking loathes it.
Penelope Douglas. She is it for me. I'll recommend Birthday Girl to anyone since I'm aware that my other favourites of her are not for everyone
"Lowe’s, Home Depot, and Menards all had bigger ceiling fan departments in the mid 2000’s, I miss that."
"You read a ton of fiction, are unconventional in thinking and enjoy spending time with your thoughts. If you're a woman you present as feminine (in a womanly vs. girly way) but have a personality more on the masculine side, if you're a man you present quite manly (probably have a beard) but are very comfortable with your feminine side, and find people who aren't ridiculous. You're an introvert but have no problem with social settings and you have a small tight knit group of friends. Your career probably isn't satisfying, but you have enough personal interests/hobbies to keep yourself engaged."
"I'm getting married next year, so I'm getting my mom a gift card to a local designer / custom dress shop so that she can have a nice custom dress made for her to wear as the mother of the groom."
Tickets to LA's Wicked.
"Go with Ubuntu LTS or Linux Mint.   I personally use Debian, but I've been using Linux for several years - it's not a difficult distro to set up, bu it isn't as user friendly as the other two.

If you're curious as to the main differences between Ubuntu and Debian, I would recommend skimming through this article:

"Ever since our kid started going to the Virus Factory (read: preschool), I've had the local Chinese food place on speed dial. Their hot and sour works wonders on the drain."

"When I started dating my girlfriend, I was suddenly attracted to everything vanilla. My drinks from coffee bean always had to have vanilla and even my car scents were vanilla scented. Thing is I didn't really realize I was doing this. Then my girlfriend mentions how her perfume is vanilla based and it all made sense! I kept wanting to be reminded of her even when she wasn't around. Anyways, I love the smell of vanilla now"
"Yes, fetch. Although technically it’s native, axios already pretty much a standard AJAX library."
The Shrike is the baddest baddie in sci Fi.  I really loved how obsessed and self absorbed martens Silenus was. So many great characters. I started with The fall of Hyperion. Endymion and the last book kind of lost steam though
England's most successful period was *before* 1970. We'd probably be ranked even higher were it to include all of football history.
Come to.england. nobody seems to give a shit about trick or treat.
I'd say spinners. Not too sure about them.
They’re having relationship problems and broke up recently I think
Adam Curtis's new epic was loaded on YT this month.
"A king size silky/fluffy blanket from Walmart. I’ve washed it and it stays the same soft texture.

It’s cool for summer and warm for winter, plus feels awesome if you’re nekked. Think it was $40.

Edit: it’s in one of my posts, the white one with cats sleeping on it."

"Let the Right One In

It had a great, subtle twist that if you miss it results in a still decent film.  But if caught really changes the weight of entire story.  Was totally left out of the American remake."
