68705,"Reading Judas Unchained right now. I have a love/hate relationship with this book. Some plot threads and characters are fascinating - MorningLightMountain, Paula Myo, Ozzie - while others are torture to get through. There's so much extraneous detail to wade through. I'm not opposed to epic-length novels, but not when 40% is padding.",best science fiction novel
26717,"Got my hands on a copy of mech vs minions and finally got a chance to play last night. Unbelievable game, absolutely loved it. 

At first we thought it was impossibly hard and we couldn't understand how we could possibly beat the scenarios, but when we realized the infinite possibilities each turn it just became incredibly rewarding each and every turn.",best board games
25256,"Tom Holland and no this isn't recency bias, I swear. I saw Tobey recently and he is just awkward and barely likeable, Andrew was not bad, but still not likeable. Holland is a LITTLE over the top, but then again so is Peter, and he was so excited the entire time, but when stuff happened he hit the right emotions perfectly, and his struggle under the rubble was great. The cheesy voiceover wasn't but holland still managed to nail that scene.",best spiderman actor

43022,"Sons of Anarchy is so underrated. Very flawed, but so beautiful. Didn't realize it was adapted from Hamlet until I googled the end, but I really appreciated that component after the fact. Weeds is a show I grew up watching as it aired, and it has a special place in my heart!!",best detective show

They are regurgitating info from two tech report articles - the older tech report article is based on LG getting 8 42"" screens out of a sheet, but the newer article is based on LG getting 10+ 42"" screens out of a sheet. Improvements that were theoretical in February seem to have been established by March.",best desktop monitor
