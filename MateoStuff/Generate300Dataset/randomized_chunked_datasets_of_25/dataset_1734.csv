68705,best science fiction novel,"Reading Judas Unchained right now. I have a love/hate relationship with this book. Some plot threads and characters are fascinating - MorningLightMountain, Paula Myo, Ozzie - while others are torture to get through. There's so much extraneous detail to wade through. I'm not opposed to epic-length novels, but not when 40% is padding."
26717,best board games,"Got my hands on a copy of mech vs minions and finally got a chance to play last night. Unbelievable game, absolutely loved it. 

At first we thought it was impossibly hard and we couldn't understand how we could possibly beat the scenarios, but when we realized the infinite possibilities each turn it just became incredibly rewarding each and every turn."
25256,best spiderman actor,"Tom Holland and no this isn't recency bias, I swear. I saw Tobey recently and he is just awkward and barely likeable, Andrew was not bad, but still not likeable. Holland is a LITTLE over the top, but then again so is Peter, and he was so excited the entire time, but when stuff happened he hit the right emotions perfectly, and his struggle under the rubble was great. The cheesy voiceover wasn't but holland still managed to nail that scene."
37842,best Marvel movie,"Lmao, nobody brought hostile here except you. Go back to r/painal you creep."
14061,best place to get free books,I can never find my books in these sites
43252,best detective show,Try line of duty on Netflix. Real gritty English police corruption drama. Pretty heavy and I thought brilliant.
23562,best car racing video game,I had the same itch and Wreckfest surprised me. Great game.
69125,best science fiction novel,"Fear the sky (along with sequels), the first fifteen lives of Harry August, and children of time."
32331,best hotel to live in,"The older I get, the more paranoid I am about how disgusting that hotel rooms likely are.

EDIT: RIP my poor inbox"
43022,best detective show,"Sons of Anarchy is so underrated. Very flawed, but so beautiful. Didn't realize it was adapted from Hamlet until I googled the end, but I really appreciated that component after the fact. Weeds is a show I grew up watching as it aired, and it has a special place in my heart!!"
52913,best hiphop album,"Kanye is hip hop for people who dont like hip hop. Sterilized for the burbs. Featuring Maroon 5? No. Keeping it real when i say fuck a Kanye fan.  In the hood they bump Jodeci, not the Beatles."
25733,best cricket teams of all time,"WI, Eng, Ind, and Pak all time XI all have a decent claim to be the best ODI sides"
23027,best celebrity,Norman Reedus was a pretty chill dude - shared a drink and a story and parted company at the hotel bar we were both staying at.

The kind with Oreos."
68697,best science fiction novel,Wooahh.... i agree the second was tough to get into but really comes together in the end but really sets up the third for what I thought was really good.
38555,best newspapers to read,"I do, in the week I make do with the online versions. But missus rockswell has a subscription over the weekend to the paper copy. You can't beat it to be fair."
56353,best desktop monitor,"That's Tom's article is a bit messed up. They are regurgitating info from two tech report articles - the older tech report article is based on LG getting 8 42"" screens out of a sheet, but the newer article is based on LG getting 10+ 42"" screens out of a sheet. Improvements that were theoretical in February seem to have been established by March."
37103,best amusement park,Never realized how good SF Great America’s lineup really is. Might just be because it’s my home park
22263,best celebrity,Goddamnit. McCaffrey is my favorite athlete ever.
13676,best research paper archive,"Trusting tweets to include the whole story is a foolhardy idea. Perhaps we can ask them directly for the paper, but how long will it take to reach me? What happens when 10,000 people ask them for papers? I'm having doubts they have the time and/or resources to become distributors at zero cost to them."
33304,best electric car,I feel only shame for forgetting about that thing.
