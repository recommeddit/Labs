72426,best keyboard switches,"I like a light tactile switch personally, could never get on board with linears. I tried holy pandas and some heavier tactiles but after awhile it became fatiguing. I previously used browns, but switched to using naevies and I enjoy them."
22535,best celebrity,"Quick story. Michael Crichton wrote about being in awe of Sean Connery, but one evening at dinner a fan approached Connery and asked for an autograph. He snapped ""I'm eating."" The fan  walked away dejected and Crichton was kinda disappointed in Connery.  But after dinner Connery walked back to the fan and said ""I'm finished my meal if you'd like that autograph now.""  Bottom line: celebs have boundaries that we can't always see, but they're entitled to have them.  Of course, some are just dicks."

64739,Best Nike running shoes,"I didn't understand the importance of a great - not just good - fit until I bought a pair of dress shoes that fit me *perfectly*. I mean, literally like a glove. I've been looking for the same level of comfort in a running shoe ever since and I realize now how everything else is secondary, including weight, flexibility or level of cushioning"
61683,Best RPG game on PS4,"Get Sleeping Dogs. The world has been made really well: I felt as if i was really in Hong Kong. The game also has an excellent story and fun gameplay and so Sleeping Dogs is an extremely immersive game in which you feel that you really are a part of the Hong Kong triads.

I have played all Uncharted games, TLOU, Spiderman, Far Cry, GTA and many others. I found Sleeping Dogs to be better than all of them. Many may disagree that it is the best game, but most will agree it is a great game"

The ginger does wonders for chest. If you've never tried it then give it a go. The stronger the better.

45390,best gaming system,"I used to be a console only player and strongly prefer controller since kb/m was alien to me. Few years after getting into pc gaming I just appreciate how fluid and unrestricted my movement are compared to controller.

 So for now all gaming preferred on pc, I just keep a Playstation and a nintendo switch purely for their respective exclusives."
