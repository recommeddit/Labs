45257,"Honestly since you’ve never really gamed that much any of them would probably do you good. 

PS4 has some great exclusives and story driven games and the same multiplatform games that Xbox has. 

Switch has probably the best exclusives, and is portable as well as a home console. Though does have some crap on it. 

Xbox has lacked in terms of exclusives in comparison to the other two (though it still has some great ones), it also has backwards compatibility which allows you to play certain older games from the 360 and OG Xbox days. Plus gamepass is probably one of the best things this generation.",best gaming system

Danny Brown - XXX

OutKast - Aquemini

I guess it depends on the specific discipline, but I get the feeling that a lot of reviewers want something to be ""new"" only insofar as it stays well within the established paradigms. *really* new approaches often get buried pretty quickly. 

And there are whole disciplines where the epistemological foundations are more than shaking. Heck, within economics, for instance, some rebels had to found the movement of ""pluralist economics"" whose core demand is that economics doesn't style itself as a natural science with monocultural methods as the past 150 years have shown time an again that this doesn't really to the everday reality of markets.
