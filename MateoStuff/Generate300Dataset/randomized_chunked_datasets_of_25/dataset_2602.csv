44388,best items under $100,"You could do about half this list and still stay under a hundo. Good job.

If you're just fixing shelves and appliances Craftsman tools will last you forever. If you really want good stuff for cheap, check out estate sales (old guys always have great sets of tools... think Gran Torino) or pawn shops, but you won't find a ""set"". For work around the house you mostly need screwdrivers, pliers, and a set of wrenches."

14410,best romantic novel,"I still haven’t found five romance books I absolutely love, but so far, the ones that have been my favorites are: 

1. Love in the Afternoon by Lisa Kleypas. This is, by far, her best work, in my opinion. The writing is so beautiful, so evocative. The way the hero and heroine fall in love with each other through exchanging letters and opening up to each other in such vulnerable ways is so, so, so lovely to read. 

2. A Week to be Wicked by Tessa Dare. I love how lighthearted and goofy the hero is, how he has such a whimsical sense of humor. I love how the heroine is so ambitious and independent and has interests and goals outside the romance. And I love how both of them constantly support and uplift and encourage each other to be their best selves.

3. Romancing the Duke by Tessa Dare. I just adore how grumpy yet endearing the hero is. His sarcastic, quick-witted humor is so fun to read, and I love the bantering and bickering that happen between him and the heroine. This is one of the funniest romance books I’ve read that still manages to be incredibly sweet and swoon-worthy."

30973,best country to live in,Austria.
33808,best Pokemon game,"best is xy, i loved everything about them, the region was gorgeous, the new pokemon looked great, i found the story interesting even tho most people don’t and unrelated but it was my favourite season of the anime

my least favourite is sun and moon i just feel like they were a chore to play through and i don’t like the new pokemon, story was pretty good tho but i preferred xy’s story especially the parts about AZ and the war 

honourable mention for the best is dppt just because of nostalgia and platinum being my first game"
37108,best amusement park,AKA a listing of the parks with the most coasters.
47535,best state to visit in the United States,Seattle. Went for a week with an ex girlfriend a few years ago. On top of all of the touristy stuff we also went to a Sounders game. I was a fan before but it turned me into a die hard supporter. Loved the weather and had an absolute blast. Really want to go back. I’ve thought of moving out there at some point..

11183,best backpack for college,"I used my Saddleback messenger bag all 4 (*cough* and 1/2) years of college, and it's still in regular rotation at the office. Held my 15"" MBP just fine, though the bag doesn't provide much padding for it. The bag converts into a backpack fairly quickly, I always bring it traveling."
72057,best movies with a cool twist,"God damn I say that all the time! I don't have a friend named Ed who is into editing at all, it's just that it came to me one day what a funny phrase that would be. Glad to hear that it has real-world applications.

Another surprisingly hard thing to say is ""I bathed today."" If you try to say it fast, it comes out ""I bathe today"" but try saying it correctly and hilarity will follow. Or you may snicker at least."
