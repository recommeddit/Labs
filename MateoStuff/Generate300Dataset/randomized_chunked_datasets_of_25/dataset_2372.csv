65269,"There is no downside to being part of a Visible Party. No member can see your phone number. No member will have any way to contact you. You may get an email if new members join, I know I did for a bit, but I unsubscribed and no longer receive those. In fact, even though I created a party with 1,400+ members in it, I don't receive any notifications for it. 

As far as I'm concerned, Visible Parties have only upsides––saving you an extra $15 per month on your cell phone bill. I'm still unsure of the best way to represent it in the chart. For now, it is technically a $40 unlimited plan, and I wouldn't want to list it as $25 and have people be upset their first bill is $40. But you raise an excellent point.",best phone service company

39297,"Lol my only issues with Firefox and it's ram usage have been with the latest 67 version that introduced that automatic tab unloading on low ram situations.

Issue with that feature on my case was, that my computer has 32gb of ram and when this feature kicked on, Firefox was using around 2gb of ram and my computer had more than 25gb still unused according to task manager.

Even though there being more than enough ram to run more than 12 identical Firefox programs simultaneously, Firefox still unloaded tabs with paused Youtube videos that i had watched only like 3 minutes ago or something.

So in my opinion Firefox could have been using at least 10 times more ram and i would have been better off with that.

I understand that this feature is nice to have for pc's with 2gb ram or something like that, i remember not having any problems with my old laptop with 8gb ram on Firefox.
In my experience windows kept things regarding ram control nicely in check, so 8gb or more is enough for Firefox so such features are not necessary.",best web browser
67256,"Sure. Treating it as unexpected is fine, but it might not be unexpected. That’s where I don’t want the library I’m using to make requests to make that assumption for me. I feel pretty strongly that error handling shouldn’t be a means of control flow. It makes it hard to determine where error handling is defensive vs expected plus try/catch blocks are just less readable than if/else in my opinion. Because of that, I don’t want my request library making assumptions of what is and isn’t an error.",axios alternatives reddit
