looks sweet 🍭
"I agree with getting a Bidet, used it once by accident in Korea, apparently it's a thing there (as well as in Japan). It was shocking, but my anus never felt the same after that. Was never satisfied with just paper from that day on, got the bidet at a bargain and pooping has never been the same ever."
Just ordered apple clear magsafe case. I don’t want to hide the design of the 13 pro max
"Legends of Runeterra. It’s a good mix between Hearthstone and Magic and it’s extremely F2P friendly with a lot of depth. The meta is extremely diverse and they put out new content all the time. Gameplay rewards smart plays and never gets stale, unlike other card games. Amazingly well done game, there’s a reason it won Game of the Year for the App Store in 2020"
Rusty's is not great but the main selling point for me is the online ordering and fast delivery. Bettina is legitimately good pizza (and IMHO the best in the area) but you have to order IRL and then drive down to get it... 😞
"I met Lady Gaga on a street corner in lower Manhattan two years ago. I had no idea it was her so we struck up a conversation as two random strangers and she ended up having her friend take a picture of us. I only found out who she was when I was getting into my uber and her friend yelled out, ""Hey you know that was Lady Gaga right!"" She was really friendly and down to Earth"
"Gundam isn't really complicated all you need is the watch order for UC and the other stuff you can watch standalone.

This was my UC watch order which went fine

0079 > The Origin > One Year War Side Stories (War in the Pocket, MS Team, Thunderbolt optional stand alones but some of the best Gundam content out there) > Stardust Memory (optional personally really didn't like it) > Zeta > ZZ > Char's Counterattack > Unicorn"
Yeah I would say the baggage was the fact that it would be the 2nd reboot of the character.

"I completed one full playthrough in Nier, and got ending A, of course.  Many people say the third ending is simply amazing, would you agree? (I'm wondering if I should return to it for that ending.)"
Keep in mind that’s peak hurricane season.
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
"What other comments have said are spot on...but I'm also pretty new to the scene. I don't have many games but I've had a ton of fun with Sushi GO party, Codenames and Ticket to Ride. These are pretty much gateway/introduction games but I haven't gotten bored of them."
"Well, if you're in college, you should be able to make that happen pretty easily."
"One time I saved up money to buy this for my boyfriend,  and when I had enough I went to go buy it with my dad.  I had him smell it, and I told him I was going to buy it for my so. I turned around to look for something else, and when I came back,  my dad had bought a bottle of it.  He loves it,  which is fine,  but now I can't get that bottle for my so."
Your dad's a smart man.
"I have a small group of friends from Denmark that I made eons ago through a game called Starcraft: Brood War - They way the describe that place makes it sound like the ""American Dream""."
Joe Rogans new special is hilarious!!!
That’s interesting. I heard nothing about the movie when I watched it so my mind was blown when the reveal happened!
That's super interesting. Those sneaky bastards have been sending me one pixel at a time? Can't wait to see what the image is once I open 1920x1080 emails.
need to qualify for tournaments to be shite in tournaments :/
"Dolce Gabanna Light Blue 🤩  

It smells like citrus and the sea"
"Most people consider the Faber-Castell 9000's to be the best drawing pencils and Staedtler's Marsgraphic in second, at least of those commonly available in openstock."
"> Spot It

a.k.a. Dobble. A great filler. I think people are caught up in getting a list of ""10 best"" games, but having short fillers is essential."
I normally don't care for romance novels but love The Time Traveler's Wife.
