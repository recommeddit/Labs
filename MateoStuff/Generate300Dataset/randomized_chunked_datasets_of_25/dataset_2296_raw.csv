"I don't usually use this language but a really fucking love the adventure aspect of Aquaman. I also really love that the whole superhero genre has taken this fantasy/sci fi adventure direction and I hope it sticks with it.

More show runners need to know how their shows will end."
"Ah, the smell of middle school."
"I don't see very many trick-or-treaters, so I try to spoil the ones I get. I like to make bags with different candies in them, plus erasers or spider rings."
