"Japanese Benriner mandoline slicer, julienne-ing and slicing veggies has never been so perfect"
The PC Police are down-voting you but your not wrong and that is helpful. Oakley even has an entire line of Asian fit glasses because SURPRISE all races aren't shaped the same. Pretending that Asian people aren't generally shaped different doesn't help anyone get proper fitting glasses.
Some actors are quite good in a specific type of roles but in other roles they are annoying. So ranking them solely on range - 1. Ajay 2. Akshay/srk 3. Saif ( thou he isn't mentioned) 4.amir 5. HR 6. Salman ( if I have to include every name)
"Yes, there is a decent performance gap between the two. But, the RTX 2060 is still plenty powerful for modern titles."
"You could just install Arch on btrfs though. I'm not saying that TW is a bad choice, but it seemed less stable than Arch to me, which is obviously entirely anecdotal. Also, the OBS is not nearly as useful as the AUR."
"[Ajax starting XI of the 1995 CL final](https://timhi.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/ajax.png)

There are many more switches which mostly vary in travel distance and pressure required to press them."
Using ILCs as a webcam over USB still isn't that great. They are all still 720p afaik.
I'm not running the new OSX atm.
"For the love of heaven, don’t go to the Coke museum on a weekend. People in my family still talk in hushed tones about the crowds we fought at the Coke museum one nice summer Saturday in ‘16.    

You could ha e an awesome US tour by buying an  Amtrak pass and flying into / out of Washington.  Spend a day in each of these cities.     

Washington> Charlotte > Atlanta > New Orleans > Memphis > Chicago > Cincinnati > Washington."
"Well, it will if you write it on there."
"In all honesty, I just take Buckleys. It taste awful, but it really does work."
[Israel Kamakawiwoʻole](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bFr2SWP1I) got all the ass.
"You may have missed it, but this is solid science backed by rigorous peer review."
"I'm starting to think that most degrees are like this now.  It's like a bachelor's is the new HS diploma. So many people have bachelor's degrees these days, that they're not worth what they used to be."
"Murder she wrote

"First thought was /r/mechanicalkeyboards .






They really do improve the quality of life for your hands though, and ears. Those clicking sounds.... Yummm."
"A hermit crab... they are so cool. You need to get them different sized shells so they can switch out homes as they grow, some food and to clean the tank out every now and again. Super simple and, again, very cool."
