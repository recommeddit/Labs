"Looking at the breakdown, Infinity War is weighed down by a 20 and a couple of 19's, which weigh down the Top 5 and Top 10 scores."

"Not really my type of scents, but still nice lineup. And coeur du desert is great, imo better than l‘air du desert"
"You’re not entitled to their time. Being considerate is acknowledging that they might not be able to fix anything and you have to look for alternatives. They don’t have to be considerate to the community as much as Picasso needs to be considerate to art critics. You don’t like it, move on.

Edit: In other less polite words. Stop being an entitled whiny prick. They did something for free, now they don’t want to do it for free anymore. Grow up and accept some personal responsibilities, not everyone is here to fix all your problems for you. If you can’t accept that. Well, too bad. Maybe consider another career."
Spoken like a true hipster
"The Lenovo flex 5 is in stock for $599 at Amazon!

Edit: that thing sold out like 15 min after I saw 10 of them in stock. Sorry for anyone who missed it."
"Planning on finally replacing my laptop once the stimulus check comes in, though I'm thinking I want to keep to $400 and below for my budget.

I don't do the fanciest stuff, but I'd like something that can handle running a few things at once without crapping itself. I'll usually have some music or Youtube running while I do work or art stuff, so being able to do that without something stuttering would be nice. I don't do much gaming on PC, but if there's something that can run stuff decently without breaking the bank, that's a nice bonus (but not crucial).

My current laptop is an Asus with 4GB of RAM and 465 GB of storage, so anything that beats that out is a huge plus."
arr me matey.
Dont set up a server on your own to download too many of these though...

"Of the Jenner sisters, Kendall is my favorite. She seems the most grounded of the Kardashian-Jenner clan in general. Least favorite is Kylie. She just doesn't seem to have much personality, and I don't like her constant need for shots. Of the Kardashian sisters, I've gone back and forth a lot over the years, but my current favorite is Kim for how hardworking she is, and my current least favorite might be Khloe. She just seems like she's given up on her love life, and is letting Tristan call the shots because her self-esteem is so low after the cheating scandals. I feel bad for her. But, I also don't like her attitude over the past few years regarding how much or how little Kourtney shares about her life. Kourtney's personal life kept the show afloat for years; she's earned her privacy, and I'm sure her kids are approaching an age where they're thankful for it."
"I saw that... I can't imagine that Google search represents any ""favorite."" No way."
I don't like kanye but [Black Skinhead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q604eed4ad0) is fucking raw.
Well I would like to be able to watch something while playing Europa universalis at the same time. I am not sure if I will like it. Maybe I am just hyped because of the cool setups I see online.
