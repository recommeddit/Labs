68267,best science fiction novel,"1. Jurassic Park - Michael Crichton

This got me into reading. I love this book so much. I know it's not a masterpiece but it's my favorite. 

2. Dune - Frank Herbert

It's such magnificent world he created. Beautiful and so deep and well thought out. 

3. Hyperion  - Dan Simmons

Each story in the book has a different style and substance. 

4. Enders Game - Orson Scott Card

Yup. 

5. Starship Troopers-  Robert Heinlein 

This is what great sci-fi is to me. A sci-fi story told around an amazing social construct and thought process."
54719,best water filter,One more happy  Berkey fan.
5454,best home improvement store,"Lowes seems to always screw me over whenever I need to do a return but lost the receipt. If you‚Äôre good with hanging onto every single receipt, then maybe it‚Äôs no sweat. I go to HD and they always at least give me store credit, which is as good as cash for me."
15989,best sunglasses for fashion,"Black RayBan wayfarers that I found on the ground in 2008. I washed them off, put them in a protective case and have been wearing them daily ever since. They fit my face, have held up well, and go with everything. They are one of my most prized possessions."
62782,Best Data Science textbook,"Think like a Data Scientist. 

As a self-taught DS, I felt like this book did a good job of what it takes to manage data science projects end to end, execute a good project, and manage customer expectations."
42371,movies like Inception,"House of Games was pretty good. It's an older movie but still entertaining. I'm pretty sure Joe Mantegna is one of the main characters. 
It's not exactly a mindfuck, but it's pretty twisty."
45001,best items under $100,"I never had good results with the divacup or similar style. After pregnancy they caused so much pain... but there is other styles, menstrual disc instead of cup, that work better for me. If you Google Softcup that style worked great for me. There's a fancier brand, Nixit, that I love but since it's $50 maybe try out one of the similar styles first to see if it even works for you? The nixit one is a very comfortable texture, holds its seal and didn't cause me any pain. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying out cups. I was really relieved when I found it since for some reason after my second kid any other style cup would cause me agonizing pain no matter the stiffness of the cup, and I hated having to go back to pads and tampons."
12705,best gifts for mom,"Actually, this is my rule for ALL holidays for mothers. Why does everyone always forget that moms are people too? Nobody (usually) gets dads kid-related gifts.

I especially do this for baby showers. Good god, the baby gets 9000 things they don't need, I think mom would appreciate a pedicure at a time when she can't even reach her own feet."

55742,best action and adventure novel series,Unless the no monsters thing is a deal breaker (although there are orc analogs) you could give the First Law a try. I think that it ticks most of your boxes

16628,best pet for toddlers,"Yeah, fish are going to get boring very quickly for a young child, and like hamsters, they require a lot more specialized care than people realize."
10576,best suitcase lock,"Flat Rate Boxes are where it's at. If you're smart about it, you can fit a weeks worth of clothes into a medium flat rate box."
33571,best electric car,Would have slightly more impact if you hadn‚Äôt called someone a ‚Äúnumpty‚Äù an hour earlier for disagreeing with your definition of 0-60 times.
23724,best car racing video game,"No, not yet anyway. There are some people on /r/linux_gaming who can tell you which wheels work though, I'm pretty sure most do."

3698,best college for research,"In Germany, in addition, most top level research takes place in ""institutes"" (Max Planck, Fraunhofer), so there massive research contributions don't count for any university based statistics."
11563,best gifts for dad,"I bought my dad a medium sized storage box for stuff. The top had his favorite sports team and was signed by some of the players. It was mostly a gift for him because he liked football. I got it handcrafted and the storage was just for important papers and stuff since it came with a good strong lock. 

When my dad passed away, he wrote his will he wanted to be cremated and dumped into the lock box. 

So....He's still technically using it to this day. 7 years later."
