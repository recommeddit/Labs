14815,best romantic novel,"I think outright the best book I have ever read would have to be {Homebound by Lydia Hope}. It wasn't perfect by far but it was absolutely perfect for me.

Another one I loved was Table for Five by Susan Wiggs but its fade to black.

However there lots of lesser titles that I enjoyed extremely such as 

{The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie by Jennifer Ashley}
{The Sum of All Kisses by Julia Quinn}
{A Lady by Midnight ,by Tess Dare}
{Untamed by Elizabeth Lowell}
{To Catch an Heiress by Julia Quinn}

A simpler one was {Broken by Elizabeth Kelly}

And an absolute favourite of mine was {It Happened One Autumn by Lisa Kleypas}"

34058,best Pokemon game,"ORAS would be my pick.  Gen 7 is alright, but a bit slow."
9710,best dorm hall at UCSB,"The thing about Manzanita is that you don't get the same social life as the other freshmen. Manz is about 60% transfer and foreign students. It is also extremely quiet and from what I've heard, not that fun. It may work for you, though. The views are also excellent from what I've heard. Also, Carrillo has gone to shit this year."

26901,best board games,"I play \*a lot\* of board games. And I've been through the top 10 multiple times, minus Twilight Struggle.   


I don't think they're biased for the most part. I'll argue Gloomhaven is. But the rest is fairly regularly playable, Twilight Imperium set aside. And still, Twilight Imperium is such an experience that it definitely deserve a spot around.

I think I can show these top games to any boardgamer and he's probably going to love them. Which makes them deserving of those spots.

Obviously everyone will have their opinion (like mine on Gloomhaven, and where I definitely think Rebellion is far superior to War of the Ring), but the general consensus makes a lot of sense.  


I do think however, that these lists are less and less relevant. There is a massive trend, especially with kickstarters, of straight 10 and 0 often before the game is even played. You can even see comments that are written as ""balancing out""..."
55795,best action and adventure movie,Great list. Sahara’s a favourite of mine. Films don’t have to have good critic ratings to have loads of imagination and escapist charm.
52967,best hiphop album,YES. Madlib produced the whole thing
72146,best movies with a cool twist,No one for the Crying Game?
36839,best roller coaster at six flags,"1. El Toro
2.  X2
3. Wicked Cyclone
4. Iron Rattler
5. Goliath SFGAm
6. Superman The Ride SFNE
7. Goliath SFoG
8. Maxx Force
9. Superman: Escape from Krypton
10. Apocalypse: The Ride SFMM

Honorable mentions for Mindbender and Riddler's Revenge SFMM

NOTE: I have not been on Wonder Woman yet but I bet it would be in there and I find Twisted Colossus and Twisted Cyclone to be overrated.  

Also I have only visited SFMM, SFDK, SFFT, SFoG, SFGAm, SFGAd, & SFNE"
30444,best Mexican war to study,"Yeah, Benjamin Fucking Franklin was a pretty interesting war."
60464,Best comedy show on Netflix,">Does it get better later on?

I thought the seasons got progressively worse. It gets way too sappy way too fast (usually it takes around 100 episodes for a Schur show to get too sappy for me, but this one did it in like 10). And I didn't find the overarching exploration of the afterlife and morality very satisfying - which was a problem since the show is a more focused serial format."

16051,best sunglasses for fashion,this morning this thread inspired me so I wore contacts and sunglasses for the first time in years. I have a beautiful pair of grey saint laurent glasses with faded lenses and I had forgotten how much I like them. by the way SLP is one of the few designer brands that uses their own designers for their sunglasses
42222,movies like Inception,"""He told me enough...he told me *you* killed him!""

16033,best sunglasses for fashion,"I keep my prescription sunglasses in my car because if I'm leaving the house, 99% of the time I'm driving. Once I get where I'm going, I'll switch before I leave the car (unless I forget like I do about 75% of the time) so I don't have to carry both pairs around since I carry a small purse if I carry one at all. If I'm just running in a store quick, I won't switch.

Prescription sunglasses were one of the best things I ever bought, seriously. Even if you use them for nothing else but driving, they are so worth it."
65021,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,Besides the unique setting I find Cold Spring Tavern to be not that great. It might be worth it for a tri tip Sammy and a beer but the full dining experience in my opinion leaves a lot to be desired.
39267,best web browser,"I wish Firefox wasn't such a RAM hog these days. I would definitely switch away from my Chromium browsers if it was.

23640,best car racing video game,"NFS Heat is awesome for a play through and totally worth it.  Other than the social medium crap they show in your face, the cars are fantastic and the game let's you have a lot of fun with them.

People are complaining the cops are tough and the game is missing cop breakers from Most Wanted, but there are specific roads you will learn you can drive a lot faster on against the cops for good escapes."

57691,best cologne,THIS
23162,best social networking site for CS,"My biggest concern with social media presence would be Twitter. Facebook had some default privacy settings, as do G+and other sites. Twitter is really all or nothing, and it's very tempting to leave it open to the public, with a bunch of drunk tweets visible. I find myself deleting questionable tweets more than I care to admit."
71948,best movies with a cool twist,Ex machina
33811,best Pokemon game,"Gold and silver for sure. The starter pokemon are the worst in the series, everything is a cakewalk other than the elite four, most of the good new pokemon are found in kanto. I rhink the only pokemin from mainland johto that I like are heracross and ampharos. Other than that yikes. People say the unova dex is bad, at least it has more than 20 pokemkn that weren't bad."
