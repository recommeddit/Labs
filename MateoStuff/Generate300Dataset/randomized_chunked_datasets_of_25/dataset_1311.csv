14815,"I think outright the best book I have ever read would have to be {Homebound by Lydia Hope}. It wasn't perfect by far but it was absolutely perfect for me.

Another one I loved was Table for Five by Susan Wiggs but its fade to black.

However there lots of lesser titles that I enjoyed extremely such as 

{The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie by Jennifer Ashley}
{The Sum of All Kisses by Julia Quinn}
{A Lady by Midnight ,by Tess Dare}
{Untamed by Elizabeth Lowell}
{To Catch an Heiress by Julia Quinn}

A simpler one was {Broken by Elizabeth Kelly}

And an absolute favourite of mine was {It Happened One Autumn by Lisa Kleypas}",best romantic novel

It is also extremely quiet and from what I've heard, not that fun. It may work for you, though. The views are also excellent from what I've heard.

26901,"I play \*a lot\* of board games. And I've been through the top 10 multiple times, minus Twilight Struggle.   


I don't think they're biased for the most part. I'll argue Gloomhaven is. But the rest is fairly regularly playable, Twilight Imperium set aside. And still, Twilight Imperium is such an experience that it definitely deserve a spot around.

I think I can show these top games to any boardgamer and he's probably going to love them. Which makes them deserving of those spots.

Obviously everyone will have their opinion (like mine on Gloomhaven, and where I definitely think Rebellion is far superior to War of the Ring), but the general consensus makes a lot of sense.  


I do think however, that these lists are less and less relevant. There is a massive trend, especially with kickstarters, of straight 10 and 0 often before the game is even played. You can even see comments that are written as ""balancing out""...",best board games

Honorable mentions for Mindbender and Riddler's Revenge SFMM

NOTE: I have not been on Wonder Woman yet but I bet it would be in there and I find Twisted Colossus and Twisted Cyclone to be overrated.  

Also I have only visited SFMM, SFDK, SFFT, SFoG, SFGAm, SFGAd, & SFNE",best roller coaster at six flags

I thought the seasons got progressively worse. It gets way too sappy way too fast (usually it takes around 100 episodes for a Schur show to get too sappy for me, but this one did it in like 10). And I didn't find the overarching exploration of the afterlife and morality very satisfying - which was a problem since the show is a more focused serial format.",Best comedy show on Netflix

16033,"I keep my prescription sunglasses in my car because if I'm leaving the house, 99% of the time I'm driving. Once I get where I'm going, I'll switch before I leave the car (unless I forget like I do about 75% of the time) so I don't have to carry both pairs around since I carry a small purse if I carry one at all. If I'm just running in a store quick, I won't switch.

Prescription sunglasses were one of the best things I ever bought, seriously. Even if you use them for nothing else but driving, they are so worth it.",best sunglasses for fashion
