32666,"I went to a friend's wedding at Beaches, Turks & Caicos. The food was good, the staff were friendly and the beach was the most beautiful I've ever seen. It was a September wedding and the resort was practically empty because it was hurricane season. No lines for food, drinks, water sports, nothing. It was really great. By far the best wedding I've ever been to.",best vacation resort

16304,"I've had fakes in the past, and I'll say my real Wayfarers have fared (lulz) really well over the last 6 years.  I'm a putz, and rarely use the case, and I have a kid and bend down and rough-house with her all the time, and they fall on the ground, a LOT.  I'm at 6 years, and the lenses are finally completely shot, and the frame is too banged up to warrant just replacing the lenses (like $22/ea, I think). 

I'm likely going to buy replacement Wayfarers, and some Persol whatevers, to be a bit fancier.  I have some Ray Ban Aviator, oversized (which are still small on my giant head/face), and I don't like them.  I need to be able to prop the glasses on top of my head, since my life consists of running errands and having my hands full, at all times :S",best sunglasses for fashion
2435,"I was using a pair of Sennheiser PC 360's and it's like being hugged around the heady by a teddy bear.  Recently picked up a pair of Audiotechnica ATH-M70x's and that's more like a leather pillow on each ear.  The Grado's stock foam cushions were too abrasive, and if it was humid at all my ears just became a swamp.  That'll probably be true of the M70x's, too, but they're still easier on the ears overall.  (Better sound, too, but also like 4x more expensive than Grados)",best headphones

I'm a Mac-using CPA so I'd love to be proven wrong, but in my experience the only thing that comes close is Excel for Mac, and as you've found it is not quite the same as Excel for Windows.
