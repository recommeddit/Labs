Tough; it's the truth.
Congratulations! Lots of fun and good memories ahead of you!
Yeah I always throw that recommendation out there.  Thanks for this list! I am excited to try these out.
Steve’s Pizza on Rosedale is my pick
"My husband wears Burberry Brit I think, I love it!"
"Sarah Morgan!!!!

I highly recommend the ""From Manhattan With Love"" series. There's three full books in it, and a couple of mini books. Each book is about a focussed on a different girl in a group of friends. 

When you're done with them there's two more series' and the characters between all three series' are kinda connected which is quite nice."
">Seemed to believe she ranked just under The Queen in social standing. In actuality she ranks just under the drummer in the third best Queen cover band in Slough.

Haha fantastic

Stephen Fry is a genuine national treasure."
"I’ve owned hamsters, rats, and a mouse, and out of those, the mouse was my favorite. He was intelligent, curious, and friendly. Hamsters are cute but not very intelligent. Rats and mice are much smarter. Temperament is really important with rats, because rat bites can be very painful (my roommate chose a neurotic rat. Mine was perfectly fine). Mice are more fragile, so I wouldn’t recommend them for young children. The big downside with rodents is cleaning their cages - it can get old after a while.

One thing that’s important to look at is lifespan - some small animals live much longer than others. Mice, hamsters, and rats have fairly short lifespans (2-3 years, usually). Snakes can live 20 years or more. I think guinea pigs are 8-10 years?"
"I asked the wifey the same question and she came up with:

**Carcassonne** (she said immediately)

**Sushi Go! Party**

**Survive! Escape From Atlantis** -- not a cooperative game, but good clean fun (killing your friends)

**Catan** (No bells and whistles, just the base set)

She agree"
Two men enter... One man leaves.
"Vodka, lime juice and lemonade/7Up. 

I do love a good cocktail though, and Apple Pie being my favourite. I can't remember all the ingredients though."
I'm 50 years old and when I watched the Vietnam series every day I would call my mom and dad and say I can't believe all this happened and I'm so glad dad didn't have to go.
love slate Grey!
"According to this, its chromium edge (yeah I didnt expect that either)

but ... eeew :(

Honestly you're better off just biting the bullet on a new battery. You probably know this already though: Cheapest place is ebay. They are usually easy to fit. Messing about with software can only give you diminishing gains."
"You can do DC dimming on OLED, Apple just doesn't.. just like they don't do Always On Display, despite doing it on the watch."
"Who should go above them? Uruguay is arguable, but then who?"
"That’s the thing! I’m not a truck person or a Ford person. I never thought I would even consider it. 

My solar array has a battery so bidirectional charging is less of a perk although still cool! Being able to power a camper or job site though is amazing."
"Came here to say this.  Richard Morgan does it better, imho, but if you want a rip-roaring evil aliens vs. military imperialists then he's your man.  No brains required, though."

"> the Dutch language is extremely hard

Though if you know other Germanic languages, it's not really all that difficult to pick up. I can understand a relatively big portion of Dutch texts based on just my knowledge of Swedish, German and English. 

It's the pronunciation that's tricky. Fucking g sounds, man. And sometimes R's are rolled, sometimes not, depending on what part of the country you're from. Personally I like Flemish the most."
"True Detective and Sharp Objects, crime/suspenseful dramas on HBO. They’re both incredible!"
"For simulation, Dirt Rally and Asetto Corsa haven't really been beaten yet.
For arcade, I actually really enjoyed the 2016 Need for Speed game. It got a lot of ridicule for its console release lacking manual transmission, but the PC release has that, along with 4k and 144hz support. It's a fun arcade racer with arcade physics and a shit ton of upgrades you can do to your car. I'm running a 1000hp aventador with drift tires right now lmao. I also heard that Forza Horizon 3 is pretty good, but they don't support my wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) because of the logo on the front."
>Tai Asks Why and Science Rules! with Bill Nye would be the safest ones to put on without listening yourself beforehand. Tai Asks Why even has a 7th Grader as one of the hosts.
"on the 5th of Sept Nike will release the Hyperfeels, a flyknit upper with I believe a 2.0 like bottom. http://nikeinc.com/news/new-nike-free-hyperfeel-functions-as-an-extension-of-the-foot"
454 album is insane. I heard face time like a thousand times atp lmao
