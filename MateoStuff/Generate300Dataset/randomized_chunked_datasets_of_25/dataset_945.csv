73878,best matte screen protector for ipad,"> How did the quality of the Paperlike hold up over time?

I don't think I used it for long enough TBH. Maybe only a few months before swapping to the Elecom.

>Also, how was the picture quality with Elecom? Was it the same as Paperlike?

As I said ""not too much compromise on screen quality"". A little bit less sharp than a naked screen, perhaps a little bit of chromatic aberration. 

After two years of daily use (drawing) my Elecom screen doesn't show any scratches, but it's losing its paper-feel around the center. I might replace it at some point but it doesn't seem like a big issue."

47522,best state to visit in the United States,"California, I went alone to go visit my auntie in Cali. I went because when I was around 10 or 11 my auntie promised that one day we would both go on a trip alone to Yosemite. She is a very experienced rock climber and backpacker. She tokd me once I was 12 I could start backpacking; however our trip was delayed until I was 16  I had been once before I don't remember much of it, and I wanted to go on a backpacking trip this time. We ended up doing 2 trails. One really short one where we saw a rainbow at the top of a waterfall and the other which we actually back pavked through. It was a 3 mil hike but it fekt a lot longer with my backpack on. Considering the fact that I was massively out of shaped at the time and my auntie was in her late 60's early 70's wheb she took me (I dont know how she still does it) it Proabably should have been harder than it was. I got to see snow for the first time (it was late August but snow was still melting all the way up there). There was probably more mosquitoes than I'd ever witnessed in my life up there (and I live in Florida) but it was still an experience I will treasure for years to come."

8466,best toothpaste,"Graduating dentist here (so everything is freshhh). A few points to clarify everything.

1. **For the average person, it doesn't matter what toothpaste you are using**: The purpose of toothpaste is to facilitate the removal of bugs from your teeth. It does through providing abrasives (why it's so gritty) and a mint-flavor (to encourage brushing through the minty freshness). SECONDARILY, it provides fluoride to help prevent cavities and triclosan to prevent plaque formation - **BUT** take these away for the average person and not much would change.  If you really want to know: 
-sensitive toothpastes are great for people with sensitive teeth BUT do not have any advantages for everyone else
-whitening toothpastes are simply more abrasive and can assist with removing extrinsic stains (wine, coffee) BUT are not able to whiten the underlying shade of teeth. This increased abrasivity DOES NOT increase its ability to remove bacteria.

2. **In fact, you don't technically need toothpaste at all**: What removes all the bacteria? The mechanical action of brushing. The mechanical action of flossing. If the chemical composition of your toothpaste mattered, then we could all just use mouthrinse and not need to brush. But studies have shown that mouthrinse is practically useless in all but compromised patients. I do not recommend mouthrinse to my patients as they believe that this can substitute for brushing - this is WRONG. 

3. **Frequency of brushing is much more important than the type of toothpaste you are using**: Brushing once a day is usually sufficient to remove all the plaque AS LONG AS YOU ARE DOING IT FOR LONG ENOUGH (see below). Studies have actually shown that most people can get away with brushing one every two days - but professional recommendation is that you brush at least twice a day because let's face it - if a health professional tells you to do something everyday, you do it once every two days, and if he tells you to do it weekly, you do it monthly. 

4. **Duration of brushing is much more important than the type of toothpaste you are using**: Studies have also shown that 2 minutes (30 seconds per quarter) is the optimal amount of time to brush to sustain a level of gingival health. Anything more and you can't get get more than 'healthy' gums - anything less and you risk leaving behind plaque in specific areas that accumulate over time. 

5. **It does not matter how you brush as long as it is comfortable for you.**: There are specific ways we like to teach our patients to brush, but by and large these are difficult to adapt to once we have become accustomed to our childhood method. Switch to a soft toothbrush and you will be okay. 

EDIT:
6. **Floss regularly!**: A couple people mentioned that I forgot to emphasize this, so editing to add this. Extremely important to floss around all your teeth. If you have big spaces between your teeth, you can purchase 'interdental brushes' that are like mini toothbrushes and they fit in the gaps between your teeth. Wax vs no waxed floss doesn't matter - whatever is your preference (wax is easier if it's really hard to fit the floss between your teeth). If you have braces, it is possible to purchase special types of floss that you can fit in between the wires and slide through the gaps."
67425,axios alternatives reddit,"The funny thing is that I hate dependencies (hence the custom class) but when I looked at what is required to implement upload progress, it was just clear as day “fuck it, we’re bringing in axios”.

23063,best celebrity,"Probably will get buried, but I met Gordon Ramsay in Cape Town about 5 years ago. He was at a bar, and not a super fancy bar either. I went up and said hello, half hoping he would call me a 'donut' or something, but he was really nice and asked me how I was. I told him I loved his shows, and recipes, and he offered to buy me a drink. Overall really nice man, and his demeanor is very calming. I felt at ease. I hope he is doing well."
