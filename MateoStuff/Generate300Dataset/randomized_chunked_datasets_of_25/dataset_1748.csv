30278,best Mexican war to study,"Essentially it is summarized as part of White, Anglo Americans efforts to fulfill their “Manifest Destiny,” of conquering the “New World.”

Davy Crockett, & Jim Bowie were “heroes” for standing up to the villainous Santa Anna at the Alamo. That’s the only moment of the whole war that gets 2 min of attention. And that’s only because it was immortalized by Disney."

1657,best ice cream flavor,"I make the ice cream for all the family gatherings. MY present to the birthday girl/boy is they get to pick the flavor. No matter what they ask for I will make every effort to make it.

So here is the list as best as I can recall of odd flavors.

* Ballerina, my niece dances (Made bubble gum flavor using icing flavor from target)
* Beef jerky pie (I ripped up beef jerky and made uncooked cookie dough in balls, freeze the balls first, tasted actually not bad)
* Raspberry, cranberry lemonade sherbert (Other niece likes sour)
* Pumpkin pie (Used pie filling, and uncooked cookie dough to add pie crust taste)

So always make new things, as I have learned so much from having to make such weird things."

54201,best medicine for a cold,"Hot beverages, preferably non caffeinated. That includes a ton of herbal teas. I make my own with a ton of spices to help recovery. I like to put ginger, some pepper corns, orange rinds, lemon juice, honey, cinnamon, cloves, and drink them by the bucket all day long and night. Yes, that'll make you pee a whole lot, and that's good. I also add garlic, but that's for the super-human apparently, because my husband runs away if I ever insinuate to put some garlic in his drink when he's sick. It is supposed to help with any sort of infection so I put two mashed cloves in mine. Sweetened with honey you won't even notice it there."

72341,best keyboard switches,"Yeah, would recommend Holy Pandas or Zealios. However, I do have to say that Kailh Speed Coppers are pretty amazing: tactile with no pre-travel; put em on your alphas and it feels like you're typing on clouds."
4888,best home improvement store,Just today I asked where an item would be located and the employee told me aisle 6 in the garden center and I had to ask a second person where aisle six was. It didn't exist! Second guy was very helpful.

23108,best celebrity,"I used to work at a Duane Reade store in downtown Manhattan. One night, Jonah Hill looking all skinny came over to the counter to buy cigarettes. He asked me to give him some matches but Store policy is that we don't give the customers matches so they usually have to buy a lighter. He wasn't really rude, although, he seemed irritated about something. I called him by his name and he replied without looking back. I believe celebrities are just tired of dealing with shit all day."

15698,best sunglasses for fashion,I loved my Kirkland's until the day i sat on them :\(
27554,best bollywood actor,"Again any interview where he says that he is different from other. His movies are different and when those became successful, journalists ask how you can do such movie, and what he says that he just liked script. 

Naseerushshin shah said that no producer will put their money on movies like
Lagaan, Peepli live or even TZP when he produced those. So journalists are not wrong in asking about why he produced such movie and he can only say that he liked the script. 

Nowhere he says that he is different from others. He always accept that SRK / Salman are bigger star and they can get audience just based on their moves but he has to work hard."
