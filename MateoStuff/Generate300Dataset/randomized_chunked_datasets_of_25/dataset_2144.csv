26910,best board games,"Redditors by definition are atypical in their amount of play - most people buy board games as an aspiration rather than with a specific plan to play.

I've worked in a high end paint store part time for a year now and still would not feel confident recommending that, I pass people who want a colour consult off to our people on staff who have design certificates."
10701,best suitcase lock,"Generally padlocks are to protect your luggage at your accomodation (e.g. a hostel), or when it might be sitting somewhere venerable (e.g. waiting for you in a storage area/sitting on a train etc).
If there's a chance of your zips popping open, it's also worth attaching one. 

If the only place your luggage is venerable is on the plane, and your zips can't pop open, I wouldn't worry about it. If security wants to get in, they'll cut off the padlock."

Mostly speed though. VLC is very slow and especially slow when  scrubbing through a video and speeding up a video is not accurate, like it says x2 but the video is clearly not x2."
