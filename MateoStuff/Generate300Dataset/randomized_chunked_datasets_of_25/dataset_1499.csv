They also soften your water. Your tap water quality is highly dependent on your municipality and the age/material of your pipes, but due to federal regulations, should always be potable.",best water filter
5870,"I'm gonna go ahead and give a probably unpopular opinion...

I think PHP is awesome, at the very least for beginners. The platforms required to make a PHP site work are incredibly easy to install. The language itself is very forgiving \(I would even call it fun\) and I wholeheartedly disagree that it encourages developers to become lazy or ""not learn the right way to do things"".

Also if you're thinking about learning the language to use it later, it powers a lot of projects out there and I personally don't think it's going anywhere for now. C#, Java and .NET are popular right now, but trends come and go, I'm sure PHP will regain some popularity eventually.  \<bracing for arguments that C#\-Java\-.NET are powerfully established and THEY're not going anywhere\>

That being said, Java and C# are perfectly good for backend, so maybe you'll want to invest time in HTML, CSS/SASS/LESS, and Javascript before trying something else for the backend.",best programming language for web development

23518,"Homologation rules in FM7 means you can’t actually “build” a crazy car and go race. 

I remember in Forza 3 or 4... swapping in a Ford 5.0L modular motor (before the coyote engines) into a Ford Focus, making it AWD, and giving it like 1000hp. Good god that car was silly. In forza 7, you swap in some upgraded brake lines and a clutch, you increase class and break homologation rules and can’t run the car. Hell, some cars even need to be downgraded to play. I still haven’t finished the main career because it got so boring I just keep going back to Horizon so I can just fuck around with cars. 

Homologation and class rules are not bad; having them for a few races would be cool but having them for the whole game is dog shit.",best car racing video game
