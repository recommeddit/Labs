30567,best Mexican war to study,I meant legal by US law
43522,best items under $100,"I am German Irish and had a skin graph on my temple, and removal of a lymph node on my chest. My wife convinced me to go. Turns out that I should have been going to the dermatologist the whole time. She saved my life. I would have waited it would have went from to lymph nodes to my brain and / or my lungs and that would have been end of story. If my wife did not insist I would not be here right now. So, I get to experience 2020... so, yeah.

in all seriousness, I may not be here. Listen to your wife.

The end result is  I cannot spend  more than an hour a day in the sun. I need to wear long sleeves and long pants and a ton of sunscreen even for a short time in the sun.

What is my motivation? I get to piss off all the people that thought I should be dead. Screw you, I am staying alive to spite you. The only downside is my beautiful wife slaps on a ton of sunscreen everytime I leave the house.

I guess living well us the best revenge.

Update note 1: Wow, thank you for all the kind messages, and yes I am doing well. And yes, I do know my wife is awesome. You all are awesome for all the support.

Update note 2: To clarify, the surgeries were covered my my insurance with a copay. The reason I say this was less than a $100 is the advice from my wife was free and the copay for the dermatologist was $10."
11661,best gifts for dad,"His coffin. I gave it to him last Father's Day so he wouldn't have to worry about my moms finances. I'm still paying it off.

22104,best celebrity,"Robert Englund the original freddy Kruger. Met him at a horror con a few years back and he was so nice, gave him a little origami frog but sadly couldnt afford a picture"
16608,best pet for toddlers,"I have had: rabbits, geckos, birds, turtles, frogs, hamsters... and after that, the reward:care ratio makes me say CAT is the ""easiest"" pet. 

One needs to budget for vetting, food, and litter. They are aware you are alive, enjoy human affection, will play with a kid, but don't require too much care. Scooping a litter box is less time consuming and easier than ANY of the care for any of the above animals."
7495,best laptop for general use,I want to buy a lightweight laptop and my choices are razer blade 14 or zephyrus g15 or zephyrus g14. Im actually thinking of buying razer blade 14. Is it a good choice over g15 or g14?
49564,best gaming monitor,"As far as my research has taken me (my way of saying I ain't no expert) ... TN is done for. VA and IPS are the only viable now. Where cheap VA suck, cheap IPS are great for the money.

But expensive VA always beat expensive IPS.

And OLED would be best but it burns."
22299,best celebrity,"Henry Winkler, the last living icon of American cool."
59088,best perfume,">Sometimes it changes subtly, and sometimes it is a drastic change. For example Perry Ellis Woman smells quite good in the bottle, but it smells *amazing* on me. Intoxicatingly good. On the other hand, though Diesel Women smells fine in the bottle, once it warms up on me it smells like the fart of a dog that has medical issues. 

I second this. I remember buying perfume ages ago and getting home and having a migraine, full blown throwing up blinding pain. My grandmother who I was staying with washed my wrists and neck to help me feel better, and I started recovering. 2 days later I had the migraine again. It turns out that the perfume was acting as a trigger for it - I had no idea this was possible but the next time I saw my doctor I asked if scents could trigger migraines and they said yes. So that perfume went in the bin!"
57680,best cologne,"If you’re just making your foray into fragrance, I definitely recommend starting small/cheap to find what scent you like. I did this, and here’s a couple that I like:

1.	Reyane Insurrection II Pure: Pretty fruity and sweet. Lots of compliments. 
2.	BVLGARI BVLGARI BLACK: Smells like leather and vanilla. I like to wear this at night when I go out. 
3.	Encore Noir: if you want woody and aromatic, try this one. Some say it smells a little synthetic though. Very strong in my experience. 

I recently just picked up testers for YSL L’Homme after hearing about it for so long, and it’s great. Pretty inoffensive and got a lot of compliments on my first time wearing it. 

I also picked up a tester for Prada L’Homme which smells great too. Quite powdery but slightly woody as well."
