10901,best suitcase lock,"If you're taking something valuable, you're probably better of shipping it.  When I travel, I usually take two laptops in my carry on, leaving all of the accessories in my suitcase with my clothes and tools.  If it's  something I can't carry on or is rather valuable, it goes to fed ex."

51647,best iphone case,Definitely a Caudabe case. Either the Sheath or Lucid Clear. Caudabe makes hands down the best cases I’ve seen so far if you want slim and protection.
43170,best detective show,"Ah, yeah it looks like The Killing isn't on Netflix anymore, my bad. It's on Hulu and Amazon Prime.

PSA -- here's a great site to find which streaming platforms a TV show or movie is currently on: https://www.justwatch.com/us"
68506,best science fiction novel,I agree with you.   How do you feel about Endymion?  Most Dan Simmons I've read outside of Hyperion has had some kind of element that let me down.   Hyperion was perfection.
62453,Best RPG game on PS4,"Each FF is it's own thing.  FFXV is okay.  There are parts I really liked (surprisingly the characters and setting).  There are parts I didn't like (the last half of the game was very rushed feeling, and a lot of the story is behind DLC paywalls).  Some of the previous FF games are on PS4 and I would recommend them over XV (FFVII, FFIX, FFX, and eventually FFVIII).  FFVI is also one of the best in the series, but isn't on PS4 as far as I know."
46496,best trick or treating candy,"Also from PA and I’ve never seen a Mars bar in my life.

I call BS"
33115,best energy drink,"I don't because I don't want a regular intake of caffeine.  I don't mind getting some foofy bullshit from Starbucks now and again, but I actually stopped drinking Coca Cola (my one true love) in September of 2007 because of the caffeine.  Well, that and the fact that I probably shouldn't have been drinking as much soda as I was drinking in the first place.

I will say that, in general, I don't perceive an energy increase from caffeine.  That's not to say it doesn't happen, but I never notice it."
20195,best workout music,Same here.
30818,best country to live in,"Pretty much.

Yes you would. Anyone who doesn't speak Swissgerman (or French or Italian) accent-free is a foreigner. On the upside, in Zürich you'd be in the biggest foreigner group."
42259,movies like Inception,"> Is Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless mind a time travel movie?

No. 

It's a really good movie though. I was skeptical going in because of Jim Carrey and it not being a comedy movie but he did an excellent job."

72561,best keyboard switches,"I have a Unicomp (buckling spring) and love it.  Not a HUGE gamer, but every few months I'll get super into TF2 for a while.  Never had any issues.

I haven't used any of the cherry switches through so I couldn't give you a comparison. I just know it beats the hell out of a cheap membrane keyboard."

17508,best iOS game,"I also hasn't played it for a while but they have just celebrated their first anniversary with a cool music video and a lengthy dev blog detailing their road map and content additions.  Personally I am into Infinite Lagrange now, which to me is like Stellaris on steroids with the visual flavor of EVE and Homeworld."
