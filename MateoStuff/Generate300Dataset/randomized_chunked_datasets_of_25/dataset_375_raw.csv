"If you're able to score 50s-80s vintage sure. Wayfarers haven't been the real deal since Bausch and Lomb sold the Ray-Ban name in the late 90s. I think that's part of the reason so many advocate internet sold knock offs. You are getting good quality lenses with the same level of UV and polarization if you want it, without paying a fortune for the name/marketing of a brand that is essentially a name license at this point."

If you just keep in mind that the whole series is about the final season and each episode is about the stories and people leading up to the literal Last Dance - I think it’s easy to follow. And they even show the year before each time jump.

"**David Attenborough Nature Documentary Series** - 1 Hour each, between 8-10 episodes per series

There's a few of these on Netflix right now, and they're all amazing. David Attenborough has a way of telling a tale of the natural world that I haven't found with any other documentarian. He breaks things down in such a way that you learn so much but are left being able to draw your own conclusions and walk away wondering about deeply interesting issues and questions. I've never seen someone who is so capable of explaining nature so succinctly and deeply as him.

There seems to be a disease in most modern nature documentaries lately that just ends up with them all being so dumbed-down and childish. The David Attenborough documentaries never have this problem. They neither assume that you're a biologist nor do they see you as an utter simpleton and talk down to you. I've never watched any nature documentaries as good as those produced, written, and narrated, as those from Mr. Attenborough. Watch them!

Let me know what you think, here :)!

Note: I posted this to [it's own thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/1mhqre/david_attenborough_nature_documentary_series_810/), as well, as I think these are deserving of a little more individual attention and discussion."

"Not to mention, they did a really good job of making it feel like he was both characters and not just one or the other.  I felt like there was a lot of disconnection between Spider-Man and Peter in the older movies."
