"If you do move to Denmark I encourage you to stay firm on speaking Danish. Danish people are very quick to help foreigners out if they don't speak the local language (seeing as they all speak fluent english), but as soon as you're not a ""fresh"" foreigner anymore you will find them subtly offenced that you don't speak the local tounge. Also danish is a beautiful, bendy language that you can manouver in so many ways it's amazing. If you want to read truly beautiful danish litterature I recommend H.C. Andersen. (He wrote The Ugly Duckling, Princess on the Pea ect.)

Why edge beta though? Do you like testing new features?
100% agree. There is a huge surplus in stem. There was a paper regarding surplus and shortage of stem. Cause they want someone from Harvard to do their lab technician Jobs and anyone lesser than that will just have to work at mcdolands.

"A GTX 1060 6GB should be fast enough for 1080p144hz in most games (albeit at lower settings), but your CPU also heavily matters for high refresh gaming. What CPU do you have?"
I've heard good things about *Cotillion* by Georgette Heyer.
"I honestly thought South Africa would feature in > 2000.  But I suppose their peak fell between decades, Eg. 2005 - 2015"
"Triple e feet here. I loved my nikes for the first few months but I injured myself more in them than any other shoe. The best shoes I've had are Brooks. New Balance was also pretty good, just don't like the style. I'm trying out some Asics right now. They feel okay"
"I picked up a Victorinox 8"" chefs knife on Amazon for about $50 a couple years ago and it's been amazing. Definitely don't need to spend over $100 unless you're really into knives or use them to make a living."
Arrival is a good one
"I grew up in Southwest Florida and we often had friends stay at [South Seas Resort](https://www.southseas.com/) on Captiva Island which is beautiful.

No one knows everything, we are all learning and growing musically together!"

I got the Ultra Hybrid!
Ps4 because i got it free
"What on earth is your standard for ""biased as hell?"", the economist has good journalism, better than almost any other publication avaliable. If you think the economist is insanely biased what exactly do you read?"

That's up for debate."
I’m surprised I haven’t seen “The Honeymoon Special” by Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero.  It’s fantastic.
