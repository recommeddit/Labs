73543,I've been happy with my Nimble 20000 mAh portable charger. New company but supposedly more environmentally friendly. 2-year warranty and they allow you to recycle up to a pound of e-waste for free with purchase.,best battery bank
36887,"As with above, I definitely say start at the front. Full Throttle and X2 get horribly long lines and have terrible throughout. Start at Full Throttle, then X2, and continue clockwise. I’ve done the hop around and counterclockwise, but this is the best way to get around. The park is just too massive with no direct route (being essentially a circle around a hill) to hop from one side to the other. The rides on the right side (Goliath, Scream, Twisted Colossus) have much better rider throughput than the left side so it’s better to end there, imo.",best roller coaster at six flags

But... rather than ask for a jacket (because of course main dude would buy his own friend a gift) friend wants him to buy his mother a waffle maker instead.

Because he loves his mama and can't afford to buy her a gift on his own!

13160,"Well, I'm not a mother, but I think that I am qualified to opine on this. 

A lot of folks will recommend a ""spa-day"" or a night at a hotel or a really nice meal or something like that. Those are great suggestions. My wife has a $150 gift certificate for a local spa sitting in her bra drawer. And it's been there for 8 months. I gave it to her three months after she had our second son. 

At three months (and in general, quite frankly) my wife had zero interest in going out and doing something without the baby or anything that would require her to adjust from breastfeeding on demand. Not saying it's wrong or right - she just feels really strongly about it. 

So that full body massage and haircut (which she said she needed - I was listening, dang it!) is just not going to get used by her. 

I'll tell you what she does love though - her Kindle Fire (substitute iPad mini, if that's your thing). All those middle of the night feedings? Slightly mitigated. Stuck in a rocking chair with a lightly sleeping baby and the sound of paper turning wakes him or her up? Never fear, e-reader is here. 

Now, you could whisk me away to /r/hailcorporate for this, but she just loves it. Plus it's small - an iPad is kinda big to juggle with a little person hanging off your tender parts. 

That or certificates to a cleaning service. Those go over pretty well and they're tres practical.",best gifts for mom
