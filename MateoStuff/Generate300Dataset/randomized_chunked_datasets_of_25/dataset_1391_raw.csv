I've always been partial to *The Diamond Age*-- I thought that was one of his more engrossing works (though it being one of the first of his books that I read might be coloring that a bit).
"Local lumber yards are generally cheaper than the big box stores (at least in my area).  When HD, Lowes or Rona are asking $3.50 for an 8 foot 2x4 SPF (insanity) the local places are around $1.90.  They seem less likely to adjust prices during peak demand seasons."
"For some reason, I got suuuuper into air traffic control videos, even ones where there isn't an accident, just an interesting exchange between the tower and pilot. Don't know why... I'm not even a pilot myself.

Then I found the Air Safety Institute channel and binged their ""Accident Case Study"" videos.  Most are not commerical flights; they are typically break-downs of how amateur flights can go so wrong."
Following - been researching cases all afternoon.  The bumps have gotten out of control.

"That many sites ranked Black Panther as their number 1 MCU film?  I mean it's a good one, but number 1?  It's pretty far down on my list, but it's a list of 20 of my favorite movies of all time ... so it's definitely not an insult, as I've that movie specifically around 10 times.  But I'd be embarrassed to admit how many times I've seen Avengers, WinterSoldier, CivilWar, InfinityWar, Endgame, and Guardians.  I really have no life these days.  ..."
Absolutely having a blast with this game. About 9 hours in. Lots of different mechanics but they all fit together and work nicely. The Studio Ghibli art style is phenomenal.
"To be fair it is super hard to win an international title, even with a ""golden generation"" you only have a few chances, it definitely requires luck as well"
"The best I can say is, if you hadn't had anything to eat or drink in an hour and were just thirsty, or you were eating a regular meal with slightly salty food, you wouldn't really taste any of the salt in Apollinaris. But if you had just got done eating a donut or an entire candy bar and wanted to wash it down with something, Apollinaris would taste salty then"
"Im thinking a japanese maple, or a nice silver wheeping birch. Both deciduous!"
"Scary? No, It's not a horror in the traditional sense. It's psychologically damaging though, it's a traumatic experience to say the least. If you're afraid of that sort of thing, thats fair.

Elfen Lied is still pretty infamous for being incredibly depressing, but beyond that it's traumatic because it's very psychologically destructive and uses violence in a fashion to highlight it's philosophical ideas and painful emotions.

It deals with a lot of very dark, and very difficult to grasp and complex emotional problems people have, and it deals with severe emotional mental trauma and heavy handed topics like Discrimination and nature versus nurture.

It's probably the only piece of media I've ever encountered that actually empathizes with the negative emotional states that bullying puts people in. 

I've never seen anything else like it.

I know plenty of people who've been dramatically impacted by the series, including myself. For some people, Elfen Lied hit like a freight train and broke them, changed their personality, or otherwise left them with a hole in their heart that's hard to really describe. 

But it's also a niche experience. Some people it breaks them emotionally, Some people just dont respond to it what so ever. 

Many scenes in Elfen Lied can change depending on your emotional state, perception, and familiarity with the series too. 

As much as I love Elfen Lied and have picked it apart and learned about it inside and out, I also have come to  realized that I cant just recommend it ad hoc because for some people it can be a really damaging experience.

The biggest problem is that you never know how someone is going to react to it. So I always suggest it or leave people with a word of caution before they watch it because I don't want to be the person who shares a traumatic experience without warning."

That's been my experience as well.
"This thread is pleasantly surprising. When I was the OPs age, I had a beloved English teacher who gave me what I considered to be very sage advice, and she was adamant about it: ""read a newspaper every day."" I subscribed to the newspaper for the next decade... but when the Internet came around, I looked at it like an anachronism and stopped. I read three, maybe four times as much news from a much wider array of editorial sources than a single newsroom could ever hope to have. It's been that way for me since. I look at newspapers as very wasteful considering the alternatives.

I am, however, heartened that there seem to be so many young people who are interested in newspapers. That can only start a lifetime of good habits, and I say that from my own experience. I still read as much actual news as I do, say, reddit... I'm a news junkie."
"Depends on who you're trying to impress. The average girl will obviously fall for the guitar, but you could also pull out a saxophone. It's easy to learn and you can jazz those panties off.

If you want to impress nerdy music girls, you'll have to learn a much harder instrument. French Horn is the hardest you can get, but you will impress the ladies with your skills.

Avoid instruments like the sac-butt and double-reed instruments. Trombones look silly and everyone who plays a double-reed instrument looks constipated the whole time."
