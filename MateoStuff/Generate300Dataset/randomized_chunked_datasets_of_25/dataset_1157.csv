23191,"I think it would be worth it to at least evaluate Drupal Commons.  It is a pretty complete social networking framework.  To use it for the final product probably involved little custom code, but mainly turning off a lot of features you don't need or want.  (Simpler is better).

If you at least install it and play around, I think it will give you some context in figuring out the path forward.  If this were my project I would install and check out a few different pre-rolled applications, Drupal Commons, BuddyPress, reddit, maybe slashcode, and take notes on each.  In the conference presentation I would include a short comparison slide, and explain what pushed you to whatever route you end up taking.

One factor that would push me towards Drupal Commons is the future maintenance and longevity of the project.  If it succeeds as a social networking site, there will be a lot of people who will be upset if it falls out of maintenance and dies.  Passing off your own custom code to a future owner has challenges.  Of course passing off Drupal to them might have challenges too.  An analysis of the options would be good as a small part of your presentation.",best social networking site for CS
