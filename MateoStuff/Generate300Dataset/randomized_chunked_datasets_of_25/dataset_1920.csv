37627,"The “BP overrated” crowd might come out for this one, but overall this is a list I can get behind. I’d obviously shift a few things up and down but I feel like it gives a good general vibe of which ones are higher tier vs lower tier.",best Marvel movie
16508,"Might get buried, but I have to speak up for ray band. I went to sunglass hut, figured out which Ray Ban I liked (the round pink ones) and bought it for almost half the price on Amazon. No joke. About every two months, Amazon has a sale on raybans. In terms of how well they stand up to time, I treat mine like crap, my boyfriend treats his great, and they both still look amazing. I'm all about RayBan.",best sunglasses for fashion

9066,"I was given one of those as a present. It's awful and doesn't work at all. I did a test where I used it on my whole mouth twice over, then broke out the floss... There was still a ton of gross stuff stuck between my teeth that only the floss could reach. If it could leave that much behind, it's clearly ineffective which is a shame because I had high hopes for it. Plus there's a lot of gross blowback from it :( I would not recommend it to anyone who is serious about keeping their teeth in good shape.",best toothpaste

16618,"Rats are awesome. I kept them for years. They are a TERRIBLE pet for a toddler. They can bite hard. A toddler isn't going to understand not to pick them up by their tail. They require a lot of attention on your part and they are social animals. You have to have at least two at all times. I'd say age 8 and up for any small mammal. 

If your cat doesn't return just go without a pet for a few years.",best pet for toddlers

4987,"I had to get a new sliding screen door yesterday. I went to HD first because it's closer. The screen doors they had in stock were all broken and out of the packaging. I went to lowes and they were all new and unbroken. I couldn't find anyone at HD to help me but I found someone in Lowes in the door section. I normally like HD better for the types of things I buy but you're right HD is starting to fall off at least in my area. I have 2 HD's close to me. One of them I won't go to after a bad experience and the ""good"" one is starting to get bad. 

The one I won't go to I bought a water heater from and when I got home and opened the box it was a used hot water heater all rusted and falling apart. Someone had returned it and they never checked the box. So I had to lug it all the way back and get another brand I didn't really want but it was all they had.",best home improvement store

68204,"* Anathem, Neal Stephenson - probably my favorite book.
* The Foundation trilogy, Asimov - mind-blowing sci-fi classic.
* A deepness in the sky, Vernor Vinge - One of the best space operas out there. 
* The Algebraist, Iain Banks - It think it's hard to like Vinge and not like Banks as well. This book has a great scope. Should have been shorter, but it's still a great book. Anything from the Culture series is a must too.
* Dune - This is soft sci-fi but a fantastic book regardless of genre.",best science fiction novel
