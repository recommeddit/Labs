17007,best iOS game,"Anyone playing my favorite — UniWar?

My brothers and I have been playing this game for over 10 years. It’s one of the first iPhone games we got into and it’s been a solid ever since. New developers took it over a few years ago and have improved it in every way possible. 

The multiplayer aspect is fantastic. You can play against people all over the world. The competition over the last few years has gotten tougher which has made it more challenging and deep. Lots of tournaments to play, both individually and with teams. 

Can’t recommend this one too much. There are inexpensive ’in-app’ purchases available which improve game play but are not required.

15946,best sunglasses for fashion,"Persol and Maui Jim definitely house the best quality lenses/frames on the market and are worth every penny. 
Persol still manufactures all of their shades in Italy and they are still hand-made, going through 15 different artisans before they make it to the consumer. Also, Persol houses their crystal glass lens which makes it worth every penny. 
Maui Jim on the other hand has the BEST Polarized lenses for more crisp detail when it comes to colors. They also have amazing customer service with a lifetime warranty included with every pair. 

I wear my Persol's when I'm going out for a day on the town, but I wear my Maui's when I'm out on the beach or doing a long day of driving."

68114,best science fiction novel,"\[Edits \- more explanation\]

These are books I always come back to

* Altered Carbon \- Richard Morgan

Great cyberpunk novel I think.  Just good fun.

* Dune \- Frank Herbert

I love the universe of Dune.  So much in there.

* Excession \- Iain M Banks

Banks has so many, I like this one as it's mainly from Minds point of view.

* Foundation series \- Asimov

The idea of applying statistical mechanics to human history.  It was great how he tied it all back to the Robots series in the end.

* Old Man's War \-  John Scalzi

Military sci fi \- also who doesn't want a new lease on life as a superhuman.

* Snowcrash \- Neal Stephenson

Cyberpunk

There are so many!

I always have a fondness for Gordon R Dickinson's Childe Cycle which never seems to get mentioned.  Dorsai! is a good jumping in point.  Soldier, Ask Not which I lent to a co\-worker and he said it was unusual having an anti hero as the main focus.

Shout out to Blindsight mentioned by @HumanSieve \- I think I love SF novels which have a great concept that I never thought of before \- dodging saccades and consciousness \(which we as humans think of as our defining characteristic\) as a crutch

City and the Stars \- Clarke \- soft spot for this one as its one of the first I read \- also a great sense of mystery and history and exploration and breaking outside of the bubble of society

A Scanner Darkly \- Phil K Dick \- a lot of PKD I think is hard to digest for me but this is autobiographical and relatable and still a killer ending

Neal Stephenson's later works too, always interesting.

Stephen Baxter's work I liked just because of the sheer scale of his vision.  And the dystopian view of the future.  The Exultant series \- doctrine, humankind all pushing towards one goal against technological superiority, military discipline in the face of FTL causality breaches, deep history

I really enjoyed N. K. Jemisin's series that won the Hugo."

26500,best politician,"A stunning lack of morals, shame, and other things that prevent sane, functioning members of society from becoming politicians."
62411,Best RPG game on PS4,"I don't think you should be downvoted, the RPG genre is very broad and what defines an RPG varies from person to person. 

To me, Nioh classifies more as an RPG because borrows from other ARPGs, It has a soulslike combat and is a loot-based game but going beyond that the game has ways to customize your character, from distributing your stats to different gear types, from battle skills to guardian spirits. Beyond that its endgame is all about min-maxing your gear, doing runs to get better quality gear or materials to forge and reroll stats on your armor, weapons and even change their appearance. You can build a character that suits your playstyle which is I think what an RPG is all about.

On the other hand, Nier has ways to customize your character but they get pushed to the background in favor of other aspects of the game. Sure you can put chips on you and complete quests but you're still playing as 2B and your playstyle is still being dictated by the moveset of a couple of weapon types. At the end of the day, I think Nier is more a story-driven hack and slash game first and an RPG second"
53679,best medicine for a cold,"Does anyone happen to know why something like DayQuil makes me feel nauseous when I take it?

I’ve tried to figure out if there is a specific ingredient that affects me negatively, but I can’t make sense of it."

24923,best spiderman actor,Tobey by default. There are some secondary elements he could improve on but he’s the only one to get the core of the character right and that’s what matters most.

3338,best webcamera,"Just as a side note, cameras are by no means required for streaming, I've talked to people who have wanted to start streaming and are just not comfortable with their appearance or don't like the idea of people seeing their face. There are plenty of quite popular streamers who have no face cam and do very well (think soviet womble or RT game). Personally, my feeling is if you arent very animated or you don't think your expressions will add anything to the stream, then I wouldn't recommend it as it can get a bit awkward for you and your viewer's id the only thing on your face cam is you staring at a screen.

Just my 2 cents, good luck in your steaming everyone!"
