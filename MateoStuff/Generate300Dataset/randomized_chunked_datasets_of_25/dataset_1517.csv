AJ Mclean booked once under his name, and I also personally booked Andrea Martin and Bonnie Hunt on separate occasions, both under their own names.

The Shaq call was hilarious, we all listened to the recording.

""OK, can I get a first name for the booking?""

""Shaquille.""

""O'Neal.""

67163,best places to skydive in california,"Check out *Skydive Perris* near L.A. (about 1 1/2 hour drive from downtown L.A.). They've been around a long time and I've had some great jumps there. Friendly people, fair prices, and lots of options.  It's going to be hot as fuck if you go during a heat wave - so be prepared to sweat while you're on the ground.

65835,best college in california,Yes? Not sure what kind of question that is. Especially 18 years ago. And starting now as well. 18 years it plenty of time to get through ups and downs of the economy. And it has been going up for 10 years now. So if you have a child nearing college age you would have easily made a good return saving for college.
