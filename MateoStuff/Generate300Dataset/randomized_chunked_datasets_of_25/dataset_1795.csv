56454,best desktop monitor,"DO NOT BUY THE AW2721D!! Ive had it for a while now and i noticed that the borders of the screen started to emit an orange glow. It got really bad, so I used my warranty to swap it out with a new one, but the new one they shipped to me had a broken stand, horrible blb, and really bad pressure damage in the middle of the screen."
514,best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit,"I have the driver, but all it does as far as I can tell is set the buttons to various possible keyboard or mouse inputs, so if the application requires a certain button to be pressed (in order to, for example, erase), then there is no way to set the hot buttons to get the pen to erase, for example."

13795,best research paper archive,"They acknowledged Franklin's contribution in their paper thus:

""We have also been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at Kings College London.""

Wilkins shared the Nobel with Watson and Crick, Franklin was dead, as has been pointed out."

49570,best gaming monitor,"I mean make sure it's 100% working. Sometimes it doesn't pick up borderless or windowed games. 

nVidia ctrl panel -> top bar -> display -> enable  g sync compatibility whatever

It shows a G Sync symbol top right (or left?) if it's actually really 100% running. 

For example, I had mine set for full screen games only (because I heard it simply doesn't work for borderless or windows).

But I couldn't stand full screen, it's horrible. I went to borderless and it only worked until the first alt tab, then it didn't anymore.

Changed settings to also detect borderless, and it worked for H:ZD. It probably won't work for older games though."
13525,best research paper archive,"That's totally fine, I just wanted to indicate that people shouldn't really expect to get the articles, which is what the post is about."
25664,best cricket teams of all time,Yeah. Unfortunately I never got the chance to watch the Windies live and was a bit young (8/9) to really understand just how good Waugh's Australia was. But I have listened into my dad and older relatives talk about it and its a fascinating convo.
71279,best movies with a cool twist,"Yeah, the movie sets itself up to be another Cool Hand Luke, about the triumph of hope, even in defeat. Then...not so much."

43873,best items under $100,"While the quality may not be 1080p, I disagree that chromecast is limited. Through a PC, the beta version of chromecast lets you cast your entire screen to the TV, letting you watch essentially anything from you computer, any file type, and not just via a chrome browser."

13348,best spreadsheet editor,"It's probably the most generally applicable.  

Programs like miniTab and SPSS are specifically tailored toward utilization of statistical data sets, so you have some general spreadsheet functionality, but everything else is geared toward that use case."

46771,best hand santizer brand,"Methanol is toxic when ingested in relatively 'large' quantities(think ounces). I imagine the issue is they're using denatured alcohol(typically 95% ethyl and 5% methanol) for their ~65% alcohol content in production. Provided that ratio is somewhat accurate i'm more than happy to use it. The FDA has to list it as a potential hazard, regardless of concentration.

If i come across hand sanitizer from one of these brands in a store and nothing else i won't think twice about using it. I mean, they put a warning out a few years ago because children had developed alcohol poisoning from hand sanitizer. So if your kid likes to drink sanitizer maybe you should avoid the cheap stuff..."
