63932,best place to pirate audiobooks reddit,"LibGen is far and away the best, better than anything else.

I'm personally fond of Archive.org and VKontakte, because I mostly like obscure out-of-print stuff and children's books - and both sites are great for one-offs that people have scanned and uploaded themselves."

72809,best Linux distro,"So alot of people are going to recommend Ubuntu. Which is a fantastic OS and a great newbie friendly system.

But you have experience with computers and programming and I recommend you just say fuck it and dive in to the deep end. Install Arch Linux....in a virtual machine (To save your sanity).

Follow this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide

You will probably fuck up. Several times. You will probably do several restarts. You will probably decide that you have no desire to keep up with Arch's bullshit and go down to ubuntu later on. But you WILL learn and get alot of skills in the process.

But if you dont go this route. No biggie. You'll still learn and have some fun. 

A few pointers though:

-A distro (Distribution) is a term for a Linux Operating System. Since Linux OS's are all really similar it makes more sense to use a separate term. Think of Linux as a community of programs. A Distro is a collection of different programs. (For example: Ubuntu and Kubuntu are the exact same OS, but they include different Interfaces)

-Desktop Environment. Think of this as a mini distro within your distro. It's a collection of software that you interact with on the desktop. Including the interface itself. 

-Repos (Repositories). Linux has been using ""App Stores"" since before they were cool.....kinda. This will be your primary form of installing software. Generally software in a Distros repo has been tested and should work fine. 

-Package manager: The program that downloads from the repo, unpackages, and installs software. You update your system through the package manager also. Most are command line based but graphical versions are getting popular. 

So that's a few pointers that I can think of. Ask if your confused! And have fun!"

47560,best state to visit in the United States,"If you're in DC when it's nice out (mid-late spring, early fall, or certain evenings in the summer), walking some of the monuments is surprisingly fun as well. Grew up in NOVA, and my senior year in high school our AP Gov classes had to split up into groups and research a monument each, then we had a full day of touring almost every monument in the city (including some of the cool lesser known ones that don't get a lot of traffic). 

Because the research was presented when we were *at* each monument, we ended up picking up a lot of tourists looking for a free tour (it was cool though, they were all appreciative and it felt nice to shed some light on smaller monuments that they probably wouldn't ever have found).

Now I just use a monument walk as a go-to date idea on a nice night, especially if the person I'm out with didn't grow up in the area."

Why yes, there is! In fact, it's better than theoretical, it's actual.
