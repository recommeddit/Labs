40943,Im just learning saxophone now and it has taken me over 5 days to find an embouchure that would allow me to MAYBE play all of the notes properly. I still haven't figured out that damned octave key and why it doesnt work when i play a G. Meanwhile on the guitar I could nearly instantly play enough chords to have played most popular music.,best instrument to play

Best part of it all?  The NYT Dining section!  Man, I love Wednesdays just because of the dining section.  It has the latest food ""trends"", food porn, great recipes, snarky restaurant reviews, sneers about hipsters, and angry letters from hippies who don't want people eating rabbit.",best newspapers to read

I'm guessing a late-20s to late-30s guy who likes a good strong drink (perhaps a whiskey or brandy) and has a penchant for opulence, contemplation, and leisure. Do you perhaps live in a cooler climate? I ask because many of these are quite warm, smoky, and amber-heavy. You seem like a Taurus, lol.

Check out the Anker ones that are 65w total. The single USB C can hit that if nothing else is plugged in. And, it MIGHT be a compromise you can make that will still charge your laptop, though slower. Not sure you will find your unicorn on this, but I respect the effort! Haha",best battery bank

5459,"That particular Lowe's is IMO the worst of their stores in the Indy area. I don't go there if I can help it. The store at Madison and County Line Rd is much better. So's the one at 465 and Emerson.

Each of the chains has a few stores that are duds. You've already found the dud Lowe's. IMO the dud Menards is the one at 465 and Pendleton Pike, and Home Depot's dud is on High School Rd.

I prefer Menards for most things; their prices are usually better than Lowe's, and about the same as Home Depot, sometimes cheaper. Menards also has many items that the other chains don't carry: pet food and supplies, an *extensive* variety of bird feeders and food, much more automotive stuff, and a small grocery section that rivals 7-11.

One chain may be better than the others for some items, worse for other items. This is how I'd rank them:

* Lumber: Menards >> Lowe's >> Home Depot

* Electrical: Menards > Lowe's >> Home Depot

* Plumbing: Lowe's > Menards >> Home Depot

* Paint: Home Depot > Menards > Lowe's (although if you're looking for solvents, spray paints, stains, or varnishes, Menards is far and away the best of the three)

* Drywall: Lowe's > Menards = Home Depot

* Plywood: Menards > Home Depot > Lowe's

* Helpful and courteous staff: Menards stands alone.",best home improvement store

Second, it doesn't matter - there are a LOT of possible permutations of an MCU top 10 list, everyone on this sub could theoretically have a unique list. This is just one.
