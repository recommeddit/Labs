It’s sad. I’m sad. I miss you.
I spent $60-70 on a Bidet attachment for my toilet last July. I haven't used paper since. It's been great and I'll never look back. Both my wife and I use it (no kids) and we now only have to buy paper for guests. I'd say it's worth every penny and will continue to pay for itself.
Very interesting!

"Ok, this comes from my expericence (it’s not a lot) if you’re on vacation, leave your better stuff at home, fancy-brand clothing/accessories they’re not that important on travel and there’s always the possibility of missing/damaging the items and maybe no insurance to cover. Everything like laptops/tablets and phones are better in the hand luggage.

Last time I traveled I avoided the luggage alltogether (just had my hand luggage and a small bag)... But then police got suspicious because it’s unusual for someone traveling and not overstock at the duty free or *not having a luggage* (apparently here in Europe everybody stocks their luggages while abroad).

Yeah, I still put the lock on my send-in luggage, it’s not for thieves but for me, I recognize my bag better and it is still holding the zip on place."
"Probably too late for this, but I'd recommend you watch a series done by the NFL Network called 100 Greatest NFL Players(Jerry Rice was listed as number one). Some of the videos are on youtube (here's a [link](http://www.youtube.com/user/The100greatest) to their channel). Their are a bunch of user videos that complete the list, which im sure you'll be able to find. These videos are great to learn about the history of the game too"
"This. I have lived in the UK where I was born/grew up, then Sweden (5 years), UK (6 years), USA (17 years), and am now retired back in the UK. It has been a fascinating ride, though every move has had tax implications, residency issues and consequences.

Also, beware vacation goggles. Visiting for a week-long vacation leaves a very different perspective to actually *living* somewhere."

"Idk. It's just delicious And easy, so I think pretty much everyone can enjoy it"
Sac State wrong
"A little more like Matrix than Inception or Memento but definitely a movie that has stuck with me for a long time. Dark City - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/ 

Also:

The Thirteenth Floor - http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Thirteenth_Floor/21310833?trkid=2361637 or http://www.crackle.com/c/The_Thirteenth_Floor/The_Thirteenth_Floor/2483633

 eXistenZ - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120907/

The Island - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/

The Fountain - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414993/

This is just a few that stick out."
"I swear I didn’t mean to write a novel, it just fell out of my fingers once I started typing."
"Take Care really is wonderfully mixed. Very clear and clean sounding, but dark and somber at the same time"
"For what it’s worth, I have another MSI monitor from the mag series (mag27cqr) and I absolutely love it. My only complaint is that it won’t run 120hz at 1440p with the series X, but that might be Microsoft’s fault. Works just fine with my pc & looks great. If that other mag is a better monitor then I imagine it must seriously kick ass."
"Alcohol-resistant bacteria are evolving, exactly as you described:

It seems a lack of thoroughness in cleaning acupuncture needles leads some bacteria to survive and proliferate between cleanings. These then go on to infect the patient."
"I’ve recommended Girl Gone Viral by Alisha Rai so much that I only need to write the first words and my phone suggests the rest. It doesn’t fit everything but I liked it for a bit older characters, bodyguard hero, some slow burn pining, heroine who actually likes other women, awkward sex and things like that."
You could buy some specialty beers!
Sounds pretty on-brand.
"Sherrilyn Kenyon and Tillie Cole. I'm always checking reviews even for authors I love, but these are the only two I can go in blind and know it's gonna be awesome!"
She’s def had to grow on me but she’s cute! She loves her food that’s for sure lol
"Altered carbon, neuromancer, snow crash, ready player 1, I robot, a scanner darkly, starship troopers, consider phlebas, protector/world of ptaavs (couldn’t call this one), desolation road. In no particular order."
"Have you read Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay? A colourful cast of characters for sure. A band of rebels disguised as itinerant musicians are trying to free their lands from a couple of powerful tyrants by playing them off against one another. 

It is intertwined with a second, more tragic tale that revolves around one of the tyrants and his favourite concubine."
Christian Bale is so thin in this it looks dangerous
You're welcome! It's very much like Warby Parker (if you've ever used them)
