Then I found the Air Safety Institute channel and binged their ""Accident Case Study"" videos.  Most are not commerical flights; they are typically break-downs of how amateur flights can go so wrong.",best YouTube video

23916,"Scary? No, It's not a horror in the traditional sense. It's psychologically damaging though, it's a traumatic experience to say the least. If you're afraid of that sort of thing, thats fair.

Elfen Lied is still pretty infamous for being incredibly depressing, but beyond that it's traumatic because it's very psychologically destructive and uses violence in a fashion to highlight it's philosophical ideas and painful emotions.

It deals with a lot of very dark, and very difficult to grasp and complex emotional problems people have, and it deals with severe emotional mental trauma and heavy handed topics like Discrimination and nature versus nurture.

It's probably the only piece of media I've ever encountered that actually empathizes with the negative emotional states that bullying puts people in. 

I've never seen anything else like it.

I know plenty of people who've been dramatically impacted by the series, including myself. For some people, Elfen Lied hit like a freight train and broke them, changed their personality, or otherwise left them with a hole in their heart that's hard to really describe. 

But it's also a niche experience. Some people it breaks them emotionally, Some people just dont respond to it what so ever. 

Many scenes in Elfen Lied can change depending on your emotional state, perception, and familiarity with the series too. 

As much as I love Elfen Lied and have picked it apart and learned about it inside and out, I also have come to  realized that I cant just recommend it ad hoc because for some people it can be a really damaging experience.

The biggest problem is that you never know how someone is going to react to it. So I always suggest it or leave people with a word of caution before they watch it because I don't want to be the person who shares a traumatic experience without warning.",best anime

38541,"This thread is pleasantly surprising. When I was the OPs age, I had a beloved English teacher who gave me what I considered to be very sage advice, and she was adamant about it: ""read a newspaper every day."" I subscribed to the newspaper for the next decade... but when the Internet came around, I looked at it like an anachronism and stopped. I read three, maybe four times as much news from a much wider array of editorial sources than a single newsroom could ever hope to have. It's been that way for me since. I look at newspapers as very wasteful considering the alternatives.

I am, however, heartened that there seem to be so many young people who are interested in newspapers. That can only start a lifetime of good habits, and I say that from my own experience. I still read as much actual news as I do, say, reddit... I'm a news junkie.",best newspapers to read
