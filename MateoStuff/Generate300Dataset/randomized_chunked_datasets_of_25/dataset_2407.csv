57582,best cologne,Not a fan of aventus. Green irish tweed is where it is at. Check out /r/fragsplits to try it some of these high dollar colognes for cheap.
31387,best country to live in,Well.. both are not like that in mine at least!!
39918,best Chrome extensions,"It's not useful, but I always make sure to have [Clacks Overhead](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clacks-overhead-gnu-terry/lnndfmobdoobjfcalkmfojmanbeoegab?hl=en).  It's a tribute to Terry Pratchett who wrote, ""A man is not dead while his name is still spoken.""  So people came together to create GNU Terry Pratchett to keep his name alive.  It's based on the Clacks system in his Discworld novels which are basically semaphore towers they use to communicate.  GNU is a code sent by the Clacks telling the next tower to send the message along, don't log it, and turn it around at the end of the line.  That way the message is going forever.  The message in this case is Pratchett's name.  The addon lets you see which websites you visit have that hidden bit of code on the page somewhere, passing his name along and keeping him alive.  If you want to see it working, [my webpage](https://www.thelostfates.com/) has the code in the background.  But all it really does is light up the icon.  It's more fun to just run across them in the wild."
33439,best electric car,"I agree. The CGI demo is just as good as a concept car when it comes to production.

And Tesla doesn't have any real advantages. GM could easily starting making batteries, EV drive trains, and an effective charging network at any time."
1278,best ice cream flavor,"Vanilla. Real vanilla.

I can’t believe only one person has said this yet."
17697,best iOS game,"Are you requesting a free premium game without ads, gems or in-app purchases or freemium as in free but with in-app gems crap and most always full size video ads? The last one I hate so much but apparently there is a market for it."
8433,best toothpaste,"Fun fact:  There's a chemical additive (Novamin) that is widely available in Europe that helps regenerate tooth enamel.  In America, this chemical is not available without a prescription.   Thanks to shitty American corporations, if you want quality toothpaste, you have to order it from overseas.

Novamin is awesome.  I had a pain in my tooth - my dentist did an xray and didn't see a cavity.  I figured it was some microscopic thing.  I use this toothpaste, no more pain."
12106,best gifts for dad,So about that Laphroaig...you happen to live in Chicagoland? I'd be happy to take it off your hands.
34029,best Pokemon game,"Am I correct in saying heart gold is a remake/remaster of the original gold? Gold was always my favourite when I started years back, would be amazing to play a remake!"
32090,best hotel to live in,"Adrift in Long Beach Wa. It’s seriously nothing fancy, but it was just remodeled before we went and is super nice! We went in April and it was cheap. I guess it’s sort of fancy because you can’t take your bathroom soap or you get charged hahaha(some fancy organic specialty made soap) 

I’ve been to more expensive places, like hotels on Mackinac Island or on the water in Seattle that are $400 a night, but I like the Adrift better."
44808,best items under $100,"Inflatable kayak for $60 was a great purchase, especially in hindsight.  They became scarce and much more expensive when the pandy hit.  It's so great to get out and explore new parts of Ontario on the water.  
I will also throw another vote out for Diva Cup."
5820,best programming language for web development,"Perl, Ruby, and a few esoteric languages are possibilities."
64735,Best Nike running shoes,In the future I’m going to try to not spend more than $120 or even $100 if I can. The fact that I’ll have to ditch the shoe anywhere between 350 and 700ish miles makes it hard to stomach a $150 shoe.
11933,best gifts for dad,Giant tube of Jaffa Cakes
44231,best items under $100,[For those who don't know what this is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BezT0aygaQ0)
32613,best vacation resort,"We went to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic in January. It was easily the best vacation we've ever taken and we're already planning our return.

46282,best trick or treating candy,Good times. *Good* times.
3017,best webcamera,"Serious streamer here (full-time for years now) and I still use a C920. I recently tried out the new Elgato Facecam but it has horrible color reproduction and overdoes the smoothing so it looks like a mild snapchat filter.

I know several 'serious streamers', full-timers, who don't give a shit about a DSLR and use whatever $50-150 cam they have."
59746,best perfume,"It’s definitely warm & strong - not for every day wear. I feel it’s truly different on everyone though. It smells too sweet on my sister in law, but it smells strong and spicy on me."
23764,best car racing video game,First is Need for Speed Underground 2. Then it's the Forza Horizon series
13269,best gifts for mom,"My dad owns a plane, so I've never paid for it. you'll typically have to pay for gas (maybe $50+) and the instructor ($25~). An obvious general rule is the smaller the plane, the less gas it uses. A Cessna 150 or 152 would be very small options, I would recommend a [Cessna_172 or similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172#See_also), as they are four-seaters."
20377,best workout music,Do you have a top 5
44009,best items under $100,It depends on whom you are buying it to.
14709,best romantic novel,"Rebecca is wonderful, though I'd class it as more mystery than romance, personally. The movie version, directed by Hitchcock is great too!

 If you want to get your friend something more modern, [ Smart Bitches, Trashy Books](http://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/) is the best site for romance reviews and related snark."
17189,best iOS game,"Nítrome’s where the good stuff is. I agree Ketchapp is a hot pile of garbage, but it’s still better than some, like voodoo."
