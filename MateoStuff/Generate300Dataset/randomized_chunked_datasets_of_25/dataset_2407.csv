39918,"It's not useful, but I always make sure to have [Clacks Overhead](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clacks-overhead-gnu-terry/lnndfmobdoobjfcalkmfojmanbeoegab?hl=en).  It's a tribute to Terry Pratchett who wrote, ""A man is not dead while his name is still spoken.""  So people came together to create GNU Terry Pratchett to keep his name alive.  It's based on the Clacks system in his Discworld novels which are basically semaphore towers they use to communicate.  GNU is a code sent by the Clacks telling the next tower to send the message along, don't log it, and turn it around at the end of the line.  That way the message is going forever.  The message in this case is Pratchett's name.  The addon lets you see which websites you visit have that hidden bit of code on the page somewhere, passing his name along and keeping him alive.  If you want to see it working, [my webpage](https://www.thelostfates.com/) has the code in the background.  But all it really does is light up the icon.  It's more fun to just run across them in the wild.",best Chrome extensions

8433,"Fun fact:  There's a chemical additive (Novamin) that is widely available in Europe that helps regenerate tooth enamel.  In America, this chemical is not available without a prescription.   Thanks to shitty American corporations, if you want quality toothpaste, you have to order it from overseas.

Novamin is awesome.  I had a pain in my tooth - my dentist did an xray and didn't see a cavity.  I figured it was some microscopic thing.  I use this toothpaste, no more pain.",best toothpaste

I’ve been to more expensive places, like hotels on Mackinac Island or on the water in Seattle that are $400 a night, but I like the Adrift better.",best hotel to live in

I know several 'serious streamers', full-timers, who don't give a shit about a DSLR and use whatever $50-150 cam they have.",best webcamera

An obvious general rule is the smaller the plane, the less gas it uses.
