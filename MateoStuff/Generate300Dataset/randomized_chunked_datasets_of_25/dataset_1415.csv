65691,best phone service company,Weâ€™ll be flying into Tampa but the only thing I can see myself really needing some data for is requesting an Uber. Iâ€™ve actually not had a problem the times Iâ€™ve used Verizon in SF. I have Starter Unlimited as well.
25905,best cricket teams of all time,The Australian team of the 2000's was nuts. They never seemed like they would lose
62660,Best RPG game on PS4,"Yeah, Jade Empire definitely rounds out my Top 15 along with stuff like Deus Ex Human Revolution, Kotor 2, Fable etc."
59655,best perfume,"Ooo this is fun but Iâ€™ve only got 5:

1. Un Jardin Sur Le Toit - HermÃ¨s
2. Un Jardin Sur Le Mediterranee- HermÃ¨s 
3. Bergamote 22 - Le Labo
4. Abd el Kader - Cire Trudon

And I know how basic this one is but I really do think it smells quite lovely:

5. Santal 33 - Le Labo

OP, the only one from your list I only really remember is Alien, which I kind of hated because it smelled sweet and very out there. So based off just that one (which I know isnâ€™t super fair), Iâ€™m gonna guess youâ€™re adventurous and unafraid to be polarizing and stand out."

12326,best gifts for mom,"The first Christmas after my daughter was born, I bought my wife a necklace with out daughter's birthstone on the charm.  It is one that can be added on to for any future little ones."
57193,best water brand,"I definitely look for zero flavor from water. I have a pretty refined palette and can pick this up constantly, I canâ€™t drink arrowhead because it tastes like Iâ€™m chugging heavy metals."
3580,best college for research,"Many, many ways to go about this. I'll leave a few that worked for me:

* To ""find"" colleges: Just do a search by ranking/price/whatever matters to go. Look at system (quarter/semester), selectivity, demographics (girls:guys, girls in engineering, etc.), and setting (rural, any cities nearby).

* Don't consider any that are unaffordable. (Unless debt is unavoidable? Or you expect lots of aid/scholarships.)

* For safety, sports, trends: Search up the school. See what comes up: news, sports, problems with administration, admissions, research...

* For community: Go to their subreddit and any other student forums you can (like on Facebook, although they might be closed off to you). Follow them a bit to experience (a fraction of) the social scene.

* For school resources: Seeing if the school HAS something, like a health clinic, is different from knowing it's accessible enough. If those resources don't provide that information on their own sites I found the next best judgement to be Facebook pages for those where people leave reviews. Look at the comments and not the star rating.

* Ask questions to current students. Some schools have a team of students that field prospective student questions that you can ask about. They will be slightly biased.

* Touring the school is best, if possible. You'll see if you're comfortable with the campus' size, hills, buildings, colors, weather, number of people sleeping on the grass, and so on."
60860,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Secret Time. Never saw that comedian before, and the start is only mildly ok. It just gets funnier. Watched a few times."
3874,best online college,I think if the degree is from a reputable institution it still holds water. [Indiana](http://www.iue.edu/online/programs.php) and [Duke](http://www.learnmore.duke.edu/online/) for example both have online degree options.
45845,best trick or treating candy,"I order the boxes from Amazon. Some kids try to get more than one and I get pissed at the greedy, ungrateful bastards. Teenage girls showed up and freaked out... *OMG, full size candy bars!* Most are little kids that didn't give a fuck, just mindlessly following parents instructions, I could have been passing out rocks for all they knew."
17657,best iOS game,"Oh my god I just launched the game to take a screenshot of my menu to show you it was there but itâ€™s GONE. I hadnâ€™t played for a bit and just relaunched the game earlier today and I saw it, so I guess the option must have just been there while the client was downloading updates, thatâ€™s a bummer. :( 

Still arcade fun minus the zombies I suppose, to be honest nothing really grabbed me except the original maps and to that end I may redownload the BOIII Zombies and play through it with my brother and relive that nostalgia if I feel the itch.

Not really the same but I played a lot of Dead Trigger some years back, I downloaded the second one but havenâ€™t played it, I may get into it as a zombie blasting alternative, also controller supported iirc."

38765,best web browser,https://tabliss.io/ Available on Chromium aswell
1826,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,you are trying too hard... ðŸ¥±
5930,best programming language for web development,"As u are just starting, I think You Don't Know JS - https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS or https://maximdenisov.gitbooks.io/you-don-t-know-js/content is the best out there. Then go learn React & Node. I think there is a comparison all over the internet why React or Node. But I will give u short description, with React's principles u can use React Native for mobile development. Node bcz then u would write an entire application in just one language, i.e, JavaScript & also NPM is the largest code repository in the world & if u are a JavaScript developer who is decent at his job then u won't be out of job for the next 10 years atleast. Mark my words, it isn't going anywhere."

47788,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Not a popular option, but look into a HP Prime. It's a touch screen calculator with a built in CAS and is often *cheaper* than the normal TI-84. I have mine and I love it."
