59655,"Ooo this is fun but Iâ€™ve only got 5:

1. Un Jardin Sur Le Toit - HermÃ¨s
2. Un Jardin Sur Le Mediterranee- HermÃ¨s 
3. Bergamote 22 - Le Labo
4. Abd el Kader - Cire Trudon

And I know how basic this one is but I really do think it smells quite lovely:

5. Santal 33 - Le Labo

OP, the only one from your list I only really remember is Alien, which I kind of hated because it smelled sweet and very out there. So based off just that one (which I know isnâ€™t super fair), Iâ€™m gonna guess youâ€™re adventurous and unafraid to be polarizing and stand out.",best perfume

3580,"Many, many ways to go about this. I'll leave a few that worked for me:

* To ""find"" colleges: Just do a search by ranking/price/whatever matters to go. Look at system (quarter/semester), selectivity, demographics (girls:guys, girls in engineering, etc.), and setting (rural, any cities nearby).

* Don't consider any that are unaffordable. (Unless debt is unavoidable? Or you expect lots of aid/scholarships.)

* For safety, sports, trends: Search up the school. See what comes up: news, sports, problems with administration, admissions, research...

* For community: Go to their subreddit and any other student forums you can (like on Facebook, although they might be closed off to you). Follow them a bit to experience (a fraction of) the social scene.

* For school resources: Seeing if the school HAS something, like a health clinic, is different from knowing it's accessible enough. If those resources don't provide that information on their own sites I found the next best judgement to be Facebook pages for those where people leave reviews. Look at the comments and not the star rating.

* Ask questions to current students. Some schools have a team of students that field prospective student questions that you can ask about. They will be slightly biased.

* Touring the school is best, if possible. You'll see if you're comfortable with the campus' size, hills, buildings, colors, weather, number of people sleeping on the grass, and so on.",best college for research

17657,"Oh my god I just launched the game to take a screenshot of my menu to show you it was there but itâ€™s GONE. I hadnâ€™t played for a bit and just relaunched the game earlier today and I saw it, so I guess the option must have just been there while the client was downloading updates, thatâ€™s a bummer. :( 

Still arcade fun minus the zombies I suppose, to be honest nothing really grabbed me except the original maps and to that end I may redownload the BOIII Zombies and play through it with my brother and relive that nostalgia if I feel the itch.

Not really the same but I played a lot of Dead Trigger some years back, I downloaded the second one but havenâ€™t played it, I may get into it as a zombie blasting alternative, also controller supported iirc.",best iOS game

Then go learn React & Node. I think there is a comparison all over the internet why React or Node. But I will give u short description, with React's principles u can use React Native for mobile development. Node bcz then u would write an entire application in just one language, i.e, JavaScript & also NPM is the largest code repository in the world & if u are a JavaScript developer who is decent at his job then u won't be out of job for the next 10 years atleast.
