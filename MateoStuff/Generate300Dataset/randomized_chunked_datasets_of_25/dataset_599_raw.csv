Thunar is good. I use window managers most of the time and found that Dolphin handles themes poorly since there are dependencies on KDE services. GNOME Files (Nautilus) is good for both GNOME and a standalone window manager.

"I can't say that I've seen bags being broken into.  

However, I've arrested over a dozen baggage handlers over the years rifling through and stealing US mail.  In two separate occasions, the baggage handler inside the plane opened our Express mail bags and opened our test piece (which was wired to alarm upon opening).  Most just took the mail, pocketed it, and then were eventually caught as they were leaving for the day.

These employees that loaded the airplanes did not work for the airlines; they worked for contractors that paid barely over minimum wage.  Most of the ones we interviewed said they needed the extra money due to the low wages."

"Not working on social media, but I guess I have both impacted them good or bad.

I started my career working on healthcare systems where our goal was to automate as much as possible, allowing for more people to get treatment.

At the same time I've also been working with banking, more specifically credit cards, which is less ethical. Not sure I'd call it unethical work, but plenty of people has gone into credit card debt which isn't really a positive impact. 

Personally I don't feel super guilty. I'm writing thr code which deals with how much is spent on the account, but it's the banks that sets up the terms, issues cards, sends the bills and ultimately put people in debt. Where is the line drawn between ""someone else's responsibility"" and ""my responsibility""? I'm not sure.

Not seen the docu though."
"2 really - craft beer and red wine.  

I own a small winery in Northern California and I've been around wine most of my life.  When I'm doing my own thing I'm visiting breweries.  A fun thing I get to do is when I'm doing weekend work such as helping out at the tasting room I have some beer I picked up earlier that week in hand."

"A good comparison. They are absolutely fun (though I don't find the post-Zoe's Tale books nearly as emotionally satisfying - Harry and Hart are fine, but they don't grow, and since like most of Scalzi's characters, they're fairly flat and immature, the lack of family relationships to promote self-sacrifice and more mature actions really keeps them stuck in a box. And I know they're supposed to be bros and love each other and stuff, but it doesn't work nearly as well as John, Jane, and Zoe.)"

"I have worked at two.  Hotels that are rated by Forbes (formerly Mobil) and randomly ‚Äúinspected‚Äù frequently, and there is a very specific checklist of things the hotel/restaurants must do/offer in order to keep their rating.  We always had to be suspicious of any single diners because they could possibly be inspectors.  So you could be a regular Joe Schmoe but if you are dining alone you are going to get the 5 star treatment.  Once we had a particular woman staying at the hotel and somehow management figured out and confirmed she was an inspector.  They literally took security cam stills and printed them out to give to all employees so we would know who she was.  I still remember her name was Katrina üòÇ


Something else interesting - one of the (5 star) restaurants I worked at (in a 5 star hotel) would frequently be closed for private events. There was usually a contract written beforehand stating the group must spend a minimum amount of money.  We got automatic gratuity on whatever that minimum was but the goal was to go over so we would make more money.  The people at the events usually didn‚Äôt know these details (they weren‚Äôt the ones paying) and towards the end of the night if they hadn‚Äôt reached the minimum we would have to start pouring the most expensive wine and liquors to meet the goal.  Who wants a few rounds of McAllen 25 doubles etc.  And people still tipped cash on the open bars so it was easy to walk away with $500 a night in tips after those parties.  It was the easiest money I ever made.
