"Sorry if I wasn't more clear.  Yes,  I prefer WonderOud  because it's less bitter."
"Tried it, switched into City Planning. More fun, more sleep, and similar pay scale."
I'm 45 min north of Lake George!
"I wish I had gone to culinary school, but the fear of not making it has deterred me from it. I also was kinda interested in being a vet, but I really dislike bio, so that was out of the question. However, I'm ok with what I'm currently studying, even though I still have doubts about it."
"""You get the one, you get that *other one.*"""
All monitors are shit. I would just buy the LG C1 48 inch TV.
Perfect place to hide the arse scratch smells
"bold choices for under 30, love it!"
"Make your own simple syrup, people, for fuck's sake.  It takes 5 minutes to make and 20 minutes to cool.  It's water and sugar 1:1 or 2:1 or 1.5:1 or however the fuck you like it.  Don't buy that shit."
Perhaps that's how he become a ghost...
"I used to deliver food from a catering service to the airport for private flights. My favorite encounter was Johnny Depp. Handed him his food and he handed me a wadded up bill, I thought I just got stiffed on my tip.

Turned out it was a freaking $100 bill wadded up into a little ball. Legend."
"""Damn, that is a pretty sweet Earth!"" you might say.  ^^round"
That fucking ship sank? I only watched the first bit. That Cameron pulled the wool right over my eyes...
This list is missing MMMbop
I never find what I’m looking for in HD. They always have the more expensive version of what I’m looking for.   It pisses me off. For this reason alone I stopped going to HD.
"Scarlett Johansson back in 2011 at a Starbucks. 

Super sweet and really bubbly. Thought she would come across as a bitch or standoffish, partly because it was early in the morning, like 5:30-6:00 am. Not at all, she was so nice. Made her laugh after I told her I was a huge fan of one of her earliest films, Home Alone 3 (which really is one of my favorite childhood movies). 

She just had this charming aura about her."
"That’s a good deal, but I’m using the free version where it refreshes monthly. I think I might like it so much because I don’t always have it running. And I also like how you can earn permanent upgrades without spending money. Great deal for when you’re brokeboi ™ like myself"
Lowes for 10% military discount. Better tool variety in Kobalt 24v family. Plus Home Depot fired that employee for chasing kidnapper and saving a little girls life. I don't care if he could have got hurt and violation policy. He saved a little girl. Now Lowes gets my money.
"Cherry MX Nature White switches.

Reds were too light, Blacks seemed too heavy. Nature White feels just right to me."
"Did you have HazMat delivery fees for yours? I ordered IPA99 from a veterinary supply company to dilute down to IPA70, but both in gallon sizes required special handling and signatures.

It was $50 per order, so I ended up ordering 8 gallons and have been using that since march. Just did another reorder to try to maintain stocks for wave 2."
"""....copious amounts of oral sex.  Maybe I'll get the child to help..."" My brain was like OH GOD NO."
"I'm fairly confused and feel like I need to see key results during each time period to see whether this is accurate. However, people here seem to be impressed so I think you've done well. In recent times it seems alright with NZ being 3rd in Tests and England being 6th. How did South Africa manage to fall so far down in ODIs between 2010 and 2013?"
"Chanel,Tendre and Kat Von D, Saint"
"Didn’t work at one, but delivered newspapers to one. 

The prostitution thing was something the desk saw a lot. The best one was when the gentlemen got robbed by two young ladies and immediately demanded the front desk call the cops. When the desk asked if he wanted to call the cops and tell them he hired two hookers (illegal)... he suddenly just grunted and marched up to his room."
"You okay dude? This is pretty dark and fucked up. Thanks for ruining my childhood. 


When’s the next one?"
