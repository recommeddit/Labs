I can vouch that it's quite good. It's on the long side but it's absolutely worth it.
And it doesn't get much better until halfway through university.
Lmao 👀
Yeah it's not heated. I think it would cost more than the gas to keep the garage heated.
Does anyone know if there are any games like the older gran turismo games on PC? Kind of like starting from a shitty car and slowly working up to a super car.
"Como shambala in Bali. 
Mulia, Jakarta. 
Mandarin oriental Bangkok. 

The service quality in Asia is just a different league."
"I can state with some experience that 2 years without brushing my teeth did not reduce the whiteness of my teeth, nor did I get any holes. I did not do anything with my teeth for that 2 year period other than brushing them with water on a toothbrush. Right now I floss and brush them, to see if there's any difference."
"“You don’t shit” beautiful champ. Thanks for taking a look at the profile too. Still is music, still isn’t objective. Sorry that I find the album a bit bland. Don’t know why you’re acting like I spit on your mother."
"Russian dash cam videos. They're both terrifying and hilarious.
It's like in Russia driver's ed consists of 2 hours of Grand Theft Auto and a bottle of vodka. 
Apologies to safe and considerate Russian drivers. I don't mean you.
P. S. Learn to tighten a freaking lug nut, will ya."
The lotion and extra soft versions of kleenex and puffs are pretty good.

I mean... its a fun holiday and you don’t have to participate but its more fun the more participate. I highly disagree with the sentiment that ANYONE should get trashed on for not providing candy or “good enough” candy... those guys can fuck right off the privileged little shits... but if YOU don’t want to participate thats your deal and yours alone and no one actually gives a shit about your opinions on the matter. If we want to dress up and give out candy thats our business as not doing it is yours. So you can kindly shut the fuck up sir.
"that is correct, not sure why someone downvoted you."
"Here's what I have there now off the top of my head:
Richard Dawkins - The Ancestor's Tale;
Charles Bukowski - The Continual Condition;
Richard Feynman - What do you care what other people think;
Steven Pinker - How the Mind Works;
Christopher Hitchens - The Portable Atheist;
Rudolph Rocker - Anarcho-Syndicalism;
Bertrand Russell - A History of Western Philosophy;
Eric Davidson - The Gunk Punk Undergut;
Leonard (Something) - The Drunkards Walk;
Noam Chomsky - (Something on Latin America);

I know there's more, but that's a good start.  My favorite book is probably Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut.  It's the only book that after finishing it I immediately started over and read it again."
"Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  Another.  DeathNote. AOT.  FullMetal Alchemist.   

Not in that order per say, but PMMM definitely in front. :3

-note- am currently watching/started Naruto, find it quite compelling, and am sorta immersed, i know its old, seems like a classic though... Had i finished it, i feel it could be mention able here."
Put a piece of toast in my mouth and run to school with my hands behind my back
"Damn. For me, I had two HPs in a row, one got a broken HDD after a year, and the other one ended up with a corrupted BIOS and a faulty motherboard in not even 7 months."
"> Oh good, my universities are on there.

Good to know they have multiple domains. I always go to audiobookbay.nl/
Yogurt and granola with a side of banana
"You can see this effect taken to a ridiculous extreme in dogs that play with tennis balls lifelong.  Every time the ball hits the ground  the fuzz collects fine grit and sand, essentially turning the outer surface into fine grit sandpaper.  Over years of chewing, dogs will wear their teeth down to nubs."

This is going to take some time....
If they are grown in Oregon they are called filberts.
"I‘ve done it like 4 times and that happened was the screen popping out a bit and some dents in the plastic. Still works fine for everything that it has to do. So that would be checking mail and getting calls.
I mean, you can‘t go wrong with it for 30€"
