"Shift 2. For me, it's the perfect blend of arcade and simulation handling. Loads of content and customisation options as well. Only major drawback is the way the drifting works is so utterly overfucked it made me quit right away."
"When designing hardware with vhdl or verilog, there are very few existing vim plug-ins that really help your work and you need to do a lot on your own. Especially vhdl's redundancy can be coded very efficiently in others editors, where I lack configurations for vim."
"Honestly cod mobile has been amazing for me, in app purchases are just for skins and you can grind for certain epic skins too."
"Hygienist—I find that electric ones are superior to manual.  Especially for kids and people with dexterity issues.  I do NOT recommend cheapo battery operated ones.  Invest in an Oral B or Sonicare that plugs into an outlet and sits on a charger.  I find that patients who use battery TBs look worse because they let the batteries run down and they become ineffective. I would have your hygienist demonstrate how to use one properly as well because they won’t work effectively with improper technique.  That being said, I have patients who do an excellent job with a manual toothbrush.  Your dental professional can help you determine if you should consider an alternative."

"I'm probably the only one, but I like Kendall. I like that she's doing her own thing and I can relate to her anxiety. It doesn't mean I always agree with her, but I like her attitude towards life"
"Used? I think it’s the i3. That’s what I got after a lot of research. The bolt was slightly cheaper with more range, but I don’t think it should be recommended now."
I haven't read the full series but the sequels are where it shines imo. Though I know that might not be an endorsement if you couldn't get into to first one though.

My PC has always done this to me. It would randomly stop loading Chrome but everything else worked. It just did it to me a little bit ago and I realized it said waiting for Adblock so I disabled it and chrome was perfect again so I think that was the culprit too. Definitely trying something else in the meantime.
"I see people saying the uke, and I've heard that, but like others have also said, there's differrnt levels of conplexity. The basic chords of the uke are fairly simple to get down, but i know some people take the uke to the next level with finger picking and percussive techniques.

However, I've also heard (though i can't attest to this as I dont play it) that the ocarina is the easiest instrument to learn. But then again, there are different kinds with different amounts of holes, so i guess it would depend what you get. And also how far you decide to take it"

"The mayor of Cormorant, Minnesota looks pretty good. And his hat is amazing!"
that sounds ideal to be honest!

Another dental student here. There is no concrete evidence that electric toothbrushes are better. What's more important is how you brush.
"Intel is better at the extreme high end.

If you plan on gaming on a 60hz screen, you will not notice any difference in peak FPS, the benefit will only show up once you invest in 144hz screens or play stuff like CSGO and need 200+ FPS, and even then i wouldnt consider the price difference between a 2600 and a 8700 or similar worth it."

"I read the local newspaper, and the college newspaper when I am at school. I actually read the newspaper more often when I am school, and when I finish I try doing the crossword and I also read the comics."
"I've seen dentists state that anything with fluoride is best and not to waste money on whitening toothpaste. The most important thing is technique. Don't brush too hard, use soft bristles, and make little tiny circles around each tooth.

I've used these basic concepts for years and finally went for a cleaning after about 15 years. They were quite surprised by the cleanliness of my teeth and told me to keep doing what I was doing.

Also, use about a pea sized bit of toothpaste. Anything more is a waste."
"A lot of people would agree with you, I however do not. It's too much. I'd say its more suited for females than a guy any day of the week, which is evident when they tell you they honestly would love to wear it themselves. More bottles of it for you, though."
Afridi/Imran should never be in the same sentence. Lol Hafeez?? Where's YK?
"People love to focus on Black Panther. Really says alot.

EDIT:
>""Black Panther is overrated and only praised cause it has black characters"" 

People didn't like the fact it won awards compared to others or whatever, but the way that people act whenever the movie is brought up is just revealing to say the least.

To put it bluntly, it feels like racism but isn't (or atleast it is a tad bit close to it). Black Panther had problems, and you don't have to like it, but if the movie is praised in the slightest someone has to chime in on how it is overrated or try to say it is only popular due to political reasons.

No one does that here with Doctor Strange (random example). 

Black Panther had many great things about it, but it seems people want to undermine all of that, and the hate around it doesn't make much sense. 

But I don't think you have to be a genius to get what i'm saying."
"not sure why it's so hard for people to post where they've been and why they liked it.   
gO tO TrIpAdViSoR...geesh.  


with that being said, we enjoyed Secrets Wild Orchid in Jamaica. Good vibe (lower capacity thanks to COVID), some food was just okay and some was fantastic. nice mix of people. good dj's at the pool, never had to wait for a drink."
"I’ve seen crème brûlé flavour once, can’t remember where it was. Didn’t taste it tho. Will have to try that too, and maybe make it too, crème brûle is my girlfriend favorite dessert. 

Capn crunch is interesting too. Not a huge fan of those  too. More a fan of frosted flake"
