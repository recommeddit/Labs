"Nautica Voyage, the old one you can't get in stores anymore.
Creed Erolfa, for special occasions."
Mine too and I agree!
"I agree. Jerry is great and all, but Joe Montana is THE MAN!"
"I rock a Berkey. Highly recommend. Sincerely, internet stranger."
I wonder how many people died getting it jjjuuusssstttt right
"China Mieville, not Melville...

Leviathan Wakes by James SA Corey

Neuromancer by William Gibson

The Martian by Andy Weir

Lethal Heritage (BattleTech) by Michael A. Stackpole

Ready Player One by Ernest Cline"
This again? Apple DOES NOT slow down old iPhones
Dasani
I’m happy to buy it here in the US and ship it to you if you wanted.
"Oh you can do so much with political science! Public policy, serving communities..."
"I don't think you really need to play 1. You'll already have LOTS of playtime on the second game, it's a better version of the 1 putting it simply. But the first game is good nonetheless :)"
I lived in a decent hotel in Hong Kong for 3-4 months a few years ago. The monthly rate was much much less than the nightly rate and not much more than renting an independent apartment long term. I forget the price but it must have been less than $3000 a month and that included daily breakfast. Was a suite type place with one bedroom and a living room off it. No kitchen. Just suited my lifestyle at the time.
"It's really good.  Forbidden Desert has a similar feel, but mixes a few things up and plays different enough to give it a look if you like Island.  I like Desert a little bit better."
"1. YSL La Nuit
2. CDNIM
3. Armani Code Absolu
4. Versace Eros
5. John varvatos vintage"
"Oh wow, right, that makes it more interesting. I’ll have a scroll through it. Cheers"
"AAPL - ubiquitous brand that can survive just about anything it seems.

DIS -  another ubiquitous brand. Makes money from many different directions: resorts, merchandise, TV and film.

COST - second-largest retailer in North America, loyal customer base, dividend is a small bonus.

KO - ubiquitous brand that offers healthy dividend and  survived several generations in an ever-changing world.

AMZN - it’s a wonder they aren’t running the world yet"
"I drove through meth-country once during a move from chicago to florida, and the one thing I remember most clearly is the box of *REAL EPHEDRINE* cold medicine. 

Ten years later and I still remember it fondly every time I have to pretend I'm enjoying the half-assed handjob of phenylephrine."
This is so true. I speak from experience.
"Which one will end up the richest, which one will be the happiest, and which one will spend the longest in jail?"
Yeah I don't know the process to get certified to do it on your own!
"Been to a hospital recently? There are Purell dispensers every twenty feet. If you don't have chunks of dirt on your hands, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is extremely effective at killing microorganisms."
The i or the Metro - stalkers corner always good for a laugh!
"Home Depot usually gets the first nod from me because they're less than a mile away. Their garden section is pretty nice and their tool section is much more organized. 

Lowe's, on the other hand, is my go to place for price matching appliances, seasonal items and LED bulbs. I know they're not the best quality, but they have two-packs of 60w equivalent for $1.50."
"I’m sure this will come as no surprise, but John Cena is one of the nicest and naturally awesome people in existence. He came to visit the new enlisted rec center they built for us back in the mid 00’s to do a meet and greet. While he was only booked to be there from 1400 to 1600, when we told him that most of the SUBSCOL students didn’t get out class until then he said he’d be more than willing to stay later. He hung out with all the guys who came to see him shooting pool, playing darts and Xbox, and pretty much signing everything and taking a ton of pictures. The dude is just a straight up class act."
