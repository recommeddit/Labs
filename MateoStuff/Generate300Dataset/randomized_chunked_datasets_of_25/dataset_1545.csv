I'm not sure how that compares to a transmission or engine or whatever, but, that's whenever it would need to be replaced after 8k IF there's a fault.  But the data thus far shows that the degradation is not going to be a big deal even after that long.",best electric car

The Lodhi in Delhi had excellent rooms and food (Indian Accent!), but the service was so-so. I’m not sure if that was just a one-off though.

My go-tos in India are either Taj, Oberoi, or Leela properties. Most of their properties outside of India are pretty great — the Taj Compton Place is a notable exception. For ROA, Peninsula and Aman properties are awesome.",best hotel to live in
