55485,best action and adventure novel series,"Pretty much every Gemmell book is like that in one way or another. Combat heavy though, doesn't have the whimsy of The Hobbit.  

R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt books exactly that, though again he excels at combat.  

_Spiderlight_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky is a modern take on a Gemmell-style adventure. (Bonus that it's stand alone)."

26115,best politician,"While it certainly was beneficial to many, the highway system *did* have its drawbacks. Highways devastated inner cities, often cleaving neighborhoods in half, lowering property values, which would later be occupied by the poorest citizens. In addition, those that could afford to leave the city did, increasing the concentration of poverty.

Many of the slums and ghettos today were caused by the highway system."
59774,best perfume,"It’s so subjective that I don’t bother with the lists. Samsara was one of my first real perfumes. It agrees with my chemistry, gets me compliments from men and women alike, and I love how it smells on my clothes the next day. That’s my personal Best Perfume Ever."

I don't really remember learning much about any way other than the Revolutionary War in primary and middle school in the early to mid 70's. I graduated high school in 1979 and the 70's are a bit hazy."

First phone bought at launch, the design, performance and camera was absolutely incredible in comparison to the bulky 3GS I had before. iOS 6’s aesthetic complemented the design so well I haven’t seen a single iPhone since that has such uniformity between hardware and software."
