My old address in NJ, AT&T was better than Verizon and it’s opposite for others, it’s all about your hood.

One thing about Verizon is that it’s king in NYC, their hometown, the only carrier to work in tunnels. So yea if you are in a city, your money may be with Verizon",best phone service company

32207,"Corporate intern events where the kids would get plied with alcohol. Infuriating. We had one company annually bring 80 interns as part of a site visit tour, and it was a nightmare.

I was sure someone would die every year. One year there were three hospitalizations though, and one of the boys sent the hospital bill to the hotel. To be clear, the entire F&B team knew about the event and were very vigilant about refusing service. We were not involved or liable in his medical issue. The audacity.

Particularly because he and all of his intern colleagues trashed everything. We had to prepare the lobby by removing sculptures and porcelain plant pots. One year we started always removing a kind of sharp-cornered bookcase because too many drunk interns had hurt themselves on it. There were bodily fluids everywhere and linens destroyed beyond continued use. Plumbing broke daily. There was always smoking damage in some rooms. 

But all the adults were useless, of course. And all adults were culpable in providing alcohol to the underage people. The company accepted the bill for the damage every year, and always came back. And we would add literally everything we could. We would tack weeks worth of room nights onto their bill because we had to keep dozens of rooms out of service while damage was repaired. The company paid for everything we comped for complaining guests too. They also paid for anything we had to replace, and they were so used to the damage fees we would just throw things in there sometimes. Like a treadmill finally broke during their residence. But did one of their guests break it? Don't know, didn't care, they bought us a new treadmill.

We were one of three hotels on this annual tour.",best hotel to live in
1140,"Late to the party, but here in Sweden we have a small ice cream maker called Lejonet & Björnen. 

Their ice cream are bit pricier, but tastes like heaven. Their ""thing"" is to have whats says on the package in the ice cream.

For example, if it says ""Organic Banana"", the ice cream has real, organic banana in it. And the ice cream isn't yellow, it's brown.
