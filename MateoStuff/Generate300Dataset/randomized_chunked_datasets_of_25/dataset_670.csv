69149,best major to study in college,"If you want an undergraduate that results in a job, computer science or some form of engineering. If you want an undergraduate that supplements another employable skillset, business. If you want an undergraduate that you can use to go into graduate school relatively easily, some social science or art program (I don't care what you say, GPAs in those degrees are typically higher and for some reason count towards graduate entrance as much as a more difficult degree.)

Despite having a couple of degrees I'm not a huge proponent of typical university degrees now that I'm in the work force. I was the first person in my family to ever go to post-secondary so my parents just assumed that university was the ticket to a good life and in reality I'm not so sure it is for everyone.

I kinda just want to be a carpenter."

17738,best Kardashian,"There’s a different between being angry and leading a bullying hate campaign. When Khloe’s little sister (Kylie) has to call her off and tell her and Kim they’re going too far that shows how her actions are deplorable. I’d get maybe a couple of indirects/directs towards the situation and venting a bit but they went on and on with it until Kylie intervened, this shows that it went beyond the original anger as became much more mean.I didn’t call her evil, I’m saying that in terms of morality I don’t understand why people says she’s the most moral because her actions say otherwise. Why do all of that to someone even if they did hurt you, it doesn’t set a good example for her daughter. 

And what about with CGM that isn’t understandable and same with Kourtney. They were actions and situations where she chose to behave in certain ways and didn’t care about the effect and impact it would have on them.

Morality is literally defined as being concerned with principles of right and wrong behaviour and holding/manifesting high principles of proper conduct. I’m not bashing her or saying she’s the worst person in the world I’m just saying when it comes to morality she doesn’t fit that and I don’t get why people think she’s the most moral"

44133,best items under $100,"Just started the couch to 5k program.

No where near a marathon but it is a start. 

So excited."
2559,best headphones,"MDR ZX-100 is what I am using now, and they have a  really nice sound and fit well for the price. They cost 20$ US (I've seen them in Canada for 30$ plus tax before) plus tax, but go on sale sometimes for less."
48955,best gaming monitor,"I bought that LG during one of its amazon sales for about $370 and I love it. I can’t really compare it to anything other than its predecessor—an 11yr old 1080p 60hz tn HP, but I have not had a single issue with the monitor the past two months I’ve had it."

67066,best places to skydive in california,"Anywhere but Lodi, really. Skydance in Davis is great, and they have big planes. Byron is nice, heard that Monterey is nice too.

And DON'T jump at Lodi."

51755,best iphone case,Idk how you don’t notice it haha. My 11 had the Defender and I felt like I could defend my self from intruders by using it as a weapon. It was huge.
63709,best books for time management reddit,Strange title for a book. Was it good?
65068,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"They have the service so wrong there right now. You pay some top dollar for food, and its very confusing as to how it is meant to be done.

In my opinion, they should do order the counter + waiters bringing the food + salsas etc out. Let the waiters have the ability to order more drinks and/or food for those in the Corazon side. I imagine there is some weird laws regarding the waiters serving alcohol from the taproom in back, which is why I feel like this place just isn't meant to be.

Can't have food that pricey / fine, and have it be such a clusterfuck inside."
41152,best instrument to play,"Look our karma, now look at mine. Now back at your karma, now back at mine.

The moral of the story: Reddit tends not to like a) dicks, and b) people who do a lot of downvoting."
19269,best YouTube video,"There was a subsequent video where the guy who did the shit build was playing some online game and venting to his team mate about how the gaming community had been mocking him and acting as if there's a right way to build a PC, which there is. That was some good follow-up cringe.

Edit: found it
