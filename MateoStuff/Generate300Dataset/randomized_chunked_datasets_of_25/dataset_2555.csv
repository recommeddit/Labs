57658,best cologne,"Having somebody pitch brands at you probably wonâ€™t help much.  The tricky thing about fragrances is how they interact with your own chemistry.  What smells awesome on one person might smell like bug spray on another.  Some people can make most anything smell cheap or like baby powder.  Smelling it off a sample card, or even immediately after spritzing yourself, could be misleading.  I donâ€™t trust my impression of anything until itâ€™s been on me for fifteen minutes or so.  Feel free to try what people are recommending (last thing I found I really liked on me was FrÃ©dÃ©ric Malleâ€™s Bois dâ€™Orage), but if you have trouble smelling it yourself, I donâ€™t see any way around it but to enlist a face-to-face person whose opinion you trust."

25867,best cricket teams of all time,"The test didn't take 2 years, the English returned home after 2 tests and sailed back to Australia for a third a couple of years later.

The longest timeless test was 12 days, I think."

73324,best Linux distro,I will check it out then!
37191,best amusement park,Living in Utah most people out here have never heard of Cedar Point or Kings Island. They are destination parks for enthusiasts but for the general public it's all about Disney...and ever since the Wizarding World opened it extends to Universal.
37034,best roller coaster at six flags,"Welcome to the US!  I just recently returned from a trip to Germany and was blown away at how nice most of the parks are in your area.  Europa may be the best theme park on the planet while Phantasialand, Efteling, and Tripsdrill are all world class.

Unfortunately, a majority of the large regional parks in the US are average to poor when it comes to atmosphere, theme, and attention to detail.  The only place that can compare to Europa or Phantasialand is Disneyland which you should definitely visit while you're in California. 

I don't know where else in the US you are planning to visit but Busch Gardens, Hersheypark, Silver Dollar City, Dollywood, and the Universal parks are just a notch below but still pretty good.  Cedar Fair and Six Flags parks have some good rides but don't expect a lot of atmosphere to go with it.  On the other hand, we have a ton of small parks, family parks, and boardwalks that are charming in their own way."
65409,best phone service company,"So, I did a cross country road trip a few years back, NYC area to San Diego. I unfortunately had T-Mobile at the time. I got royally screwed over by them. At the time, I don't remember the details, but they messed something up that made it out to be that my account wasn't paid. They turned off my cell phone while I was in the middle of nowhere and unable to make a call. To make it even better, their billing department isn't 24/7 so I wasn't even able to rectify the situation. Ironically, I was the only person out of the group that I was with that had service at that one particular spot. Fortunately, we were at a rest area when we needed to get our car towed and were able to go inside and use theirs, but that made me particularly salty. I say mine worked ironically because there was a several day stretch where I didn't have any service when everyone I was with did. Verizon had service pretty much for the duration and ATT was in at a close second. After that whole debacle I switched to Verizon as soon as I got home and haven't really looked back since. I had a short time when I was on Project Fi but had similar problems as I did with T-Mo and would up getting on my fiance's Verizon plan. I would vote that Verizon is the ""best"" carrier, but it certainly comes at a cost."

31080,best country to live in,"Vancouver is probably one of the cities with the mildest weather in all of Canada. Take it from me who's from a country that basically has two seasons, 40C summers and 30C rainy winters, lived there for two months and adapted pretty quickly. The coldest it got when I was there was -5C."
69684,best major to study in college,"Ask the school. If they are ABET accredited they will have no trouble showing it off, you should get a very firm ""yes, we are ABET accredited"" type of response. If the answer is wishy-washy and they seem to be dodging the question, they likely aren't."
58918,best perfume,I'd love to swap samples!  Just have to figure out how I can get ahold of some vials.  I've not decanted/swapped before but I'm totally into it!

44825,best items under $100,"Oof this one hits home, woke up 2hrs early due to the wind moving the curtain so much my room lit up everytime a gust came in. Gonna find a proper blindfold because i'm sick of waking up too early again.

Edit: after some research ordered one, can't wait to try it and get some extra sleep"

27256,best stocks to buy,"Databricks, yet to list, will outpace both Planatir and Snowflake in the long run."
30773,best country to live in,"I forget which one it was but it was one of those European countries that I'm sure is nice but I'd never move to since I hate the thought of dealing with snow for half the year.

Australia ain't bad though. Lived here my whole life and never had anything too major to worry about. It's not too far down the list of best countries to live in anyway and unlike all the other places above it it's actually pretty good weather here for most of the year, The best place you can be for people like me who don't even like standing in the freezer aisle for too long."
36898,best roller coaster at six flags,"I don't really like ranking stuff, but if I had to put a list together, it'd probably go like this:

1: Feista Texas
2: Great America
3: Great Adventure
4: St. Louis
5: America (home SF park) 
6: Darien Lake
7: New England
8: The Great Escape
9: Over Georgia"
