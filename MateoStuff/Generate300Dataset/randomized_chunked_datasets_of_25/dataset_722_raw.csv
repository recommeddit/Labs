"I had Nick Hogan, Hulk Hogan's son, for a client at my business about 10 years ago. The kid gets a bad rap. For being so young, he was very professional, understood the business we were doing, and was impeccably polite.

After working with Nick for about two years, he stopped by my office one day and the Hulkster walked in with him. I did a happy dance on the inside, but played it cool on the outside. Hulk just kind of hung around our lobby while Nick and I had a brief 10 minute meeting.

When I walked Nick out of my office, he introduced me to his dad, Hulk Hogan. I shook hands with Hulk and said it was nice to meet him. Like Nick, he was super nice.

Nick kind of looked at me, smiles, and says, ""You want a picture with my dad?"" Remembering which of them was my actual client, I said, ""Really, I'd like a picture with both of you if it's okay!""

And that's how I got a picture of me with Nick Hogan on my right and Hulk Hogan on my left."

"Pursue, I'd assume. Your major matters much much more than a minor when it comes to employment. If you can find something you enjoy through a minor in college then that's great. 

My brother for example majored in Comp Sci but did a minor in Music Technology. Semi related, but he's working cyber security for a bank now not a music tech thing lol. He just always enjoyed audio engineering and stuff so he decided to add a minor for that for fun. If you're gonna pay a shit ton of money for a school then you might as well add something you enjoy."
saffron then again that would be a pain in the ass to manage and take care of. Then i would go with hop shoots

They're Taking the Hobbits to Isengard
Lucky Number Slevin. The Kansas City Shuffle at its finest.
"Thanos snapping his fingers and wiping out half the life in the universe is the biggest part of the Infinity Gauntlet comic event so I know that was going to happen.

What I did not expect was a pile of major characters (like the entire GOTG except for Rocket Raccoon) to be casualties of the film.  Even the comic series kept a lot of the major heroes alive after the snap."
Free Solo and The Jinx are a couple of my favs
Norway the only one without an immigration issue.
"Disagree, plain white out of the can is a very harsh color and there are hundreds of white options for a reason. Something with a bit of depth will keep the room from looking like a hospital. I like Benjamin Moore Swiss Coffee"
"alot of games are exclusive to the switch so those will run great. other games im not 100% sure, but I've never heard/seen any complaints"
I think the best alternative for AdMob to monetize your app is the Facebook audience network! AdMob are the worst when it comes to monetize traffic don't mention to use if you arent using it yet.
