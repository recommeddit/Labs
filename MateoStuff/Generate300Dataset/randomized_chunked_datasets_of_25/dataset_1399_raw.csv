"Heel feels too short for me as well, otherwise a good shoe. Don't think i can get over it so i think i'll have to take them back. Just feels off."
Sangria. It taste good and gets me drunk.
Brandon Rogers. He's sketches are like early-youtube videos but with an hd camera.
"Such an amazing fragrance, I am obsessed with it and I need to buy 12 more. Thanks for reminder!

What do you pick for summer weather?"
"No prob! Having the padded section for the Surface wouldn't hurt, either"
"People hate him because of the post-*Good Will Hunting* and pre-*The Town* era. He made absolute shit films like *Reindeer Games, Pearl Harbor, Paycheck,* and of course, *Gigli* and *Daredevil* in that timeframe. Mind you bad writing/directing account for two of those, but people hate the vessel that brings disease."
"Yes. I am also one of the Tibetan Mountain Temple mourners, forever seeking a dupe. Iâ€™ve tried several indie fragrances mentioned as similar, but none are TMT. I have maybe 2.5 ml left in my last bottle. Sigh."
I'm in italy though
"If you're going to an online school, shouldn't the expenses be less?"
"Welp, there's no accounting for taste, is there?

Bless your heart."
"I had Butter Almond once at a place in Denver, I will never go back to pecans"

Wow I can't believe I've never seen that masterpiece. The dude in the video really Crushed it.
"One book that truly change my life was Time Warrior by Steve Chandler and there is a free audio version of it on Youtube. If you search youtube for it, you will find it. Great great read."
"Corn snakes can be good family pets with heavy adult supervision. At that age your biggest concern would be hygiene...little kids tend to put their fingers in their mouths, which is a big no-no when handling reptiles. Otherwise they're extremely low-maintenance (a single betta is more work than a corn), cheap, docile, hypoallergenic, and fairly long-lived...20 years isn't uncommon. Check out r/cornsnakes."
"Until they provide a better UI for the installation and repo adding process, Cydia is better

It also crashes anytime I have the MacCiti ZodTTD Archive added"
"Twilight Struggle remains my all time favorite board game.  Kind of shocked to see it ranked so low over a game like Deception, but I get different people have different tastes."
Awesome post. I had only used pubmed in the past. Thank you!!
"I believe it's not as much Deprecated as it is ""finished"". You can use it for many years to come. It's just more of a signal that no new features will be added. I think it's nice, you won't be stuck refactoring after some big version update or whatnot."
'How to Fix a Drug Scandal' was incredible! Totally second this recommendation!
"I think the overall combination of more highly ranked schools, more Nobel prizes, and better athletics stills gives the edge to the University of California. I guess this will be determined when UCLA meets UVA this fall :p"
Damnit
"Downtown: Scarlet Begonia and The Empty Bowl, At the Marina, Brophys, For in Montecito check out The Miramar"
"I dont know where that other poster got educated from, but I was taught Texas declared independence from Mexico.  In my public schooling it was basically Texas was settled by Americans after Mexico invited them in, Texas wanted independence, Alamo happend, Texas won, Joined the US later, Mexican War started over Texas border dispute.

Learning about the details such as the Texians and Tejanos, Santa Anna being a dictator and San Jacinto itself didn't come until taking a specific class on Westward Expansion in undergrad as a history major. My history professor did also tell us that Santa Anna eventually ended up living on Staten Island for a bit."
"Idk, sometimes there are other priorities (like a house and kids). But saying broke-ass people can't game on a PC, when there are still millions of people playing software like RuneScape or Warcraft 3, seems a little silly. The PC I built for gaming in 2002 with a mix of new and recycled parts could run software like that. There are YouTube channels even dedicated to building ""new"" capable gaming machines out of used hardware. Like any hobby, it can be approachable for many price points."
