3624,best college for research,"Also, there's a language issue. I did research in France, and there is a cultural preference to publish in French in many circles (or a resistance to publish in English, the result is the same) which limits exposure to the rest of the world which mostly publishes/reads in English in academia. This can reduce the impact factor rankings of French research, and correspondingly downgrade the perceived research quality of French universities, which are actually excellent schools in general for both teaching and knowledge output."
36292,best alcoholic drink,"wheat beer, cant get why people are not drinking it."
71978,best movies with a cool twist,"Na you definitely weren’t the only one, it’s just that me and I’m sure some other movie go-ers didn’t pay attention to that kinda stuff and assumed status quo was god."

12083,best gifts for dad,Upvote for best new way to say blowjob I've heard since middle school
54566,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"1. Yes I think hien is a great pic! I also had a mp510 desk pad size. I liked it! The Cordura feels interesting for sure. Since you're used to slightly rough surfaces and want a little more speed, hien is perfect!
2. So I just go right to artisans website, provided there's no Japanese characters then you made it! I just good artisan mousepad and generally a link for the hien pops up, I usually go there and as long as it's in English, then you're good. You could order from the Japanese version, but not sure how that works with Google translate... I wouldn't risk it.

I think the top 3 (zero, hien, otsu v2) are out of stock right now. Check out @IsArtisan on Twitter for when they go in stock, or regularly check the website to see."

51721,best iphone case,Spigen Liquid Air
71380,best movies with a cool twist,Den of Thieves. the last 30 mins of that movie was wild
36998,best roller coaster at six flags,"I just went friday, I agree on most things minus riddler. I would probably bump full throttle to #2 because its smooth and reridable. Not really sure where riddler ranks but its high for me,  I love standups. Getting the restraints right is all the difference.

Twisted is in competition for my top #1. After only doing NTG, twisted is insane with the off axis twists, double downs, and inversions, where NTG is only small straight ejector hills. Not to mention I got to race or get close to racing 4/6 loops around."

3. Ready To Die
4. Get Rich or Die Trying
5. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"
52365,best hiphop album,"Good list, but gkmc shouldn’t be there imo, a bit unfair that Kendrick takes the top 2 spots. Also I wouldn’t really count Endtroducing as a hip hop album"
