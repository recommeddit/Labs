3624,"Also, there's a language issue. I did research in France, and there is a cultural preference to publish in French in many circles (or a resistance to publish in English, the result is the same) which limits exposure to the rest of the world which mostly publishes/reads in English in academia. This can reduce the impact factor rankings of French research, and correspondingly downgrade the perceived research quality of French universities, which are actually excellent schools in general for both teaching and knowledge output.",best college for research

54566,"1. Yes I think hien is a great pic! I also had a mp510 desk pad size. I liked it! The Cordura feels interesting for sure. Since you're used to slightly rough surfaces and want a little more speed, hien is perfect!
2. So I just go right to artisans website, provided there's no Japanese characters then you made it! I just good artisan mousepad and generally a link for the hien pops up, I usually go there and as long as it's in English, then you're good. You could order from the Japanese version, but not sure how that works with Google translate... I wouldn't risk it.

I think the top 3 (zero, hien, otsu v2) are out of stock right now. Check out @IsArtisan on Twitter for when they go in stock, or regularly check the website to see.",best artisan mousepad alternatives

36998,"I just went friday, I agree on most things minus riddler. I would probably bump full throttle to #2 because its smooth and reridable. Not really sure where riddler ranks but its high for me,  I love standups. Getting the restraints right is all the difference.

Twisted is in competition for my top #1. After only doing NTG, twisted is insane with the off axis twists, double downs, and inversions, where NTG is only small straight ejector hills. Not to mention I got to race or get close to racing 4/6 loops around.",best roller coaster at six flags
