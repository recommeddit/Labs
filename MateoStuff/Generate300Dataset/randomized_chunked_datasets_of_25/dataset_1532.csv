25510,"It's almost impossible to come up with such a list. You'd really need to break it down into:

- Openers
- Bradman
- 4 through 6
- Gilchrist
- Bowlers

The only two nailed on positions would be Bradman at 3 and Gilchrist to keep. From there Kallis and Sobers must be in, and the obvious openers are Gavaskar and Hobbs, so you can name a Top 5 as:

1. Hobbs
2. Gavaskar
3. Bradman
4. Kallis
5. Sobers

With Gilchrist coming in at 7. This leaves the 6th position (though you could move Sobers to 6 with the other batsmen in 5). The problem here is that there are just so many options. Tendulkar, Ponting, Sangakkara, Lara, Richards, Dravid, and so on. I'd probably shorten the list to Tendulkar, Ponting and Sangakkara though, all 3 having a serious claim. 

- Tendulkar: Shear longevity and weight of centuries
- Ponting: At his peak he was only second to Bradman
- Sangakkara: Shear weight of runs

As this is an ""All time Test XI"", I'll take it to mean the best player for the job, not the one with the best longevity. In this regard I'd put it down to Ponting or Sangakkara. In terms of players at their very peak though, it would have to be Ponting. He may not have aged as gracefully as Tendulkar or Sangakkara, but this isn't about who was the best in their mid 30s, but rather who was the best at their peak, and Ponting edges that one. 

Depending on tastes you could order that list as you want, but I'd probably go with:

1. Hobbs
2. Gavaskar
3. Bradman
4. Ponting
5. Kallis
6. Sobers
7. Gilchrist

This leaves the bowling attack, which is probably the hardest to pick. Having Kallis and Sobers in the side certainly helps in that regard. Ultimately though there are so many different sets of players that people could pick here. Personally though I'd take Warne, Steyn, Marshall and McGrath. Steyn might stick out as an odd choice, but his numbers in an era for Batsmen speaks volumes. Ultimately though there will always be plenty of debate on any team given, but I'd give mine as:

1. Hobbs
2. Gavaskar
3. Bradman
4. Ponting
5. Kallis
6. Sobers
7. Gilchrist
8. Warne
9. Marshall
10. Steyn

4208,"I'd say my top 5 go something like so...

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit)

Honourable mentions go to:

* [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit)
* [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)

This wasn't always the order (SciTE, Notepad++, Atom, Vim have all been at the top of my list), but for the most part the key benefits are:

* feature-rich
* cross-platform (except for Notepad++)
* syntax highlighting
* autocomplete
* ongoing support via developers and communities
* Unicode
* free (except for Sublime Text, which has never been compelling enough to warrant the cost, though it has also never really been a primary editor for me... despite influencing others in the list)

Fair enough, large files, obscure language support, bloated installs and some slowness on startup, and (in the case of modern command palette editors or Vim) changes in mental model when processing code can change individuals responses to different editors.

So, why is VS Code at the top of my list?

Over the last few years, I went from Vim to Atom to VS Code...

Vim is cool, productive, but large source trees just got irritating (even with NERDTree) and search tools...

Atom (after it got a bit of a speed injection) was pretty great (despite the occasional issues with the Squirrel updater eating CPU), but a language plugin I use for work went downhill, I seemed to encounter more problems with git integration at the filesystem level (than with VS Code), and VS Code just got faster/smoother (and I got used to it, as it improved).

For those wondering what cool things are on my VS Code list, here's a short list:

* theme support is good (and affects the sidebar) - CTRL+K, CTRL+T to switch themes when my eyes start to bug me is nice too
* CTRL+ENTER and SHIFT+CTRL+ENTER for opening new lines above/below your current line
* CTRL+D (and CTRL+K, CTRL+D) to do multi-selection/multi-cursors (and skip occurrences) is nice - SHIFT+CTRL+L to select all occurrences is pretty groovy too
* CTRL+I to select the current line (without a lot of cursor movement)
* CTRL+ALT+ARROW for block selection mulit-cursors
* CTRL+B to hide/show the sidebar (and SHIFT+CTRL+E to access the file list, then CTRL+1 (or 2, etc.) to move back to your editing window) is nice
* CTRL+\ for a split of the current file (and the standard CTRL+F4 to close a split)
* bracket matching, with SHIFT+CTRL+\ to jump to the matching bracket saves some time/confusion
* CTRL+K, M to change the source mode/syntax highlighting (NOT CTRL+K, CTRL+M which allows keybinding selection)
* ALT+Z to toggle word wrap
* CTRL+/ for quick commenting
* SHIFT+CTRL+F for folder level search with a number of bells and whistles (did I mention folder level editing... also supported easily by Sublime and Atom, and in a similar, but different way, in Komodo Edit)
* paste in some JSON, hit SHIFT+ALT+F to format (make sure you've switched your source mode to JSON)

That doesn't even include the Git integration, terminal/shell integration, debugging (which I've never used), numerous plugins (which I go light on anyway), state memory through editing sessions (even on unsaved files)... which I never used to like... Markdown preview, monthly updates, and more I'm sure I'm forgetting.

The good news, is that many of those features (and even keybindings) are the same/similar in Atom or Sublime.

Syntax highlighting can lag a little in VS Code (usually on switching tabs), and startup time could be a bit laggy (though I never really notice, and pretty much always have my instance open), but other than that... It's my editor to beat.

I'd also recommend looking at the editors supported by [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/#integrations), if you're looking for preferred Windows editors. They should support the ones with the most demand (or that made the most sense).
