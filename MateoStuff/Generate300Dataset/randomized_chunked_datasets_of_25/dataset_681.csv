61732,Best RPG game on PS4,"Well then I have some bad news for you...

Sorry, I'm just very confused here, what?"
26127,best politician,"Yeah Anthony Weiner isn't really someone I would rank as a top politician. It's very satisfying one you're on the left to hear someone in the top position say the same kind of stuff that you read on your favorite blogs, but was Anthony Weiner ever going to rally a bunch of congressmen to pass meaningful legislation?"

15847,best sunglasses for fashion,"Worse than how? Build quality? Or licensing? I'd argue if they have nothing proprietary, they have less of a chance to monopolize. Nothing which forces companies to use them. Licensing alone isn't inherently bad or evil, it's standard practice in business.

Thanks for the info by the way. Checking out the link now."

37213,best amusement park,"I live in Anaheim, so I'm only 15 or 20 minutes from Knott's, but about 2 hours from Magic Mountain. I go to MM once a year, and that's enough for me, but I just *love* spending time in Knott's. I go like 2 or 3 times a month, and while I try to ride Ghost Rider at least once per visit, most of my time there is spent just wandering around and enjoying the atmosphere. Imo, Ghost Town is the best themed land in the state, and I'll die on that hill."

34887,best NFL player,"Agreed that it's the most recognized and therefore most important to perception, but that still doesn't mean that SN/PFWA considered to be worth less by the NFL or HOF voters.

> HoF site also lists Pro Bowl appearances the same as All Pro awards, but that in no way means Pro Bowls are weighted the same as All Pros.

I don't really understand this point. The HOF lists them as a different award, as they are, and they don't say they're weighted the same.

I didn't know that about comp picks, thanks! Weird that SN doesn't count, maybe because it's because they aren't a large collaboration of writers."

11237,best gifts for dad,"My dad came to this country when he was 16, and two father's days ago, I remembered how he mentioned that he never had a yearbook, because when he was asked to purchase one he didn't even know what it was. I called his high school and tracked down a woman who was making the yearbook digital (they had no hard copies to sell). She said it'd be done in a few months, so I waited, called, and it wasn't. I kept calling until around the next father's day it was done. I purchased a copy and I'll be damned if my father didn't cry. He popped the CD in and just kept saying ""wait, how?"" It was really fun to watch because his memories of those years were all foreign and now he looked back on them as an American / English speaker. But now I can't ever get him a better gift...
Tl;DR Got my dad a copy of his high school yearbook from when he was a foreign teenager. Ruined all future father's days."
41289,best instrument to play,"Well where do we draw the line between calling a piano an instrument and calling a launchpad an instrument? When you press a button on a launchpad, a set sound or musical note is played. When you press a button (or key) on a piano, a set musical note is played. The only difference is the delivery method (launchpads complete a circuit whereas pianos pivot a hammer). In the end, you're both pressing buttons in a complex manner to create music. I mean if we assume launchpads weren't instruments, then that would make electric keyboards not instruments as well."
32756,best vacation resort,"These were all priced out direct. I went through Expedia, cheapcaribbean etc but the prices always came back close. I was told that if you can't get a good deal that it's safer to just go direct due to changes, cancellations etc. Southwest vacations did have some OK deals going on with air though, but once again they weren't a huge savings.

But we are having a hell of a time picking. We want to book in the next few weeks so I have been researching as much as possible."
