Fried chicken has always been my favorite food. My grandparents used to wrap up a drumstick in foil for me every year. It's one of my fondest memories of them.

I mean the “more op the more often you restart” was straight of the handles of what FTL actually is, and was the last sentence too, and for me gave the final tip off that yep, OP can’t be talking about FTL."
I wish more podcasts spent a second or two recapping methods used.  I feel they don't in most of the podcasts and feel like recapping methods would really reinforce the tools used for discovery.
"If you use [booking.com](https://booking.com) or similar try to enter exactly  7, 14 or 30 nights. Weekly/ bi-weekly / monthly rates may pop up that you never see if you enter a different amount of nights."
The new iPhone comes out in September I believe . And it's the one that finally catches up to all Android specs .. 120 hertz and all that jazz ... I'm sure it will be pricey unless you get the mini but in my opinion with iPhones build quality being the best you can buy in any phone brand (s21 ultra user myself ) I'm gonna buy the new iPhone.
"Has anyone seen the R code equivalent in python for the examples, for those of us that stick to python (numpy + pandas)?"

"With VPNs, ownership of the company is important. If it's suss, why use it?

Ya it’s either HYPSM people care about or T20s.
"i have no idea why you are being downvoted you are completely correct, this monitor is notorious for having awful banding"
"There seems to be a lot of negativity about this movie, though while I pretty much saw the ending coming that wasn't the point: The execution of the ending and what it meant for the character was pulled off in an honest way that made sense for the character but was surprising to boot.

"Do you find a lot of overlap in coverage between wapo and nyt? I'm definitely only subscribing to one newspaper, but am curious as to the reasons of having more than one. Maybe if I ever have more free time I'll change that"
"They have a pretty big market here in south east Asia, but otherwise yep e-commerce website. You could try Amazon and AliExpress who do ship internationally with tracking"
