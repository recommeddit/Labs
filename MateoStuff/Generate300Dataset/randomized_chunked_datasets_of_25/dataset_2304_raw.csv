"Base price $40k before $7500 tax credit and possible state tax credit. In other words, a $31-32k EV crossover (for many) with an 82kWh battery is getting competitive with ICE. Having driven ID.4 it’s a lot nicer than the RAV4 I rented."

"I would guess that you're somewhere in your late-20s to mid-30s. Probably fairly feminine, you like to look good, not in a conceited way but just in a it boosts your confidence way, probably some kind of professional with a stressful career. And I'd guess, without knowing half of those and just based off the names, that you like sweet florals.

Mine would be (in no particular order other than what comes to mind)

1) Vilhelm Poets of Berlin

2) Micallef 20th Anniversary

3) Creed Aventus

4) Dior Homme Original

5) D&G The One

6) Histoires de Parfums 1969

7) Dior Fahrenheit

8) IA Yesterday Haze

9) Vilhelm Room Service

10) Malle Portrait of a Lady"
"I disagree. While OLED on my Xs Max looks pretty darn good, the black smearing is there, and, for me it has been increasingly annoying. At first it was the Apple Watch app, and now it’s the whole OS with Dark Mode.

I know you can deactivate Dark Mode but that kinda defeats the purpose of OLED. At first I thought it was a bug with my specific unit but can’t unsee that smearing anymore, going as far as having thoughts about switching to an LCD iPhone when this one retires, but that telephoto would have me on the fence.

edit: typo"

"i think this list sucks (Stone's list is much better as a musical jump off point rather than an end all be all), but it's an impossible task. There is so much good music out there. Probably better music out in the ether that we have never heard that is better than our favorites. Your suggestion are pretty damn good, but even the best lists just exist as discussion points and/or discovery points imo"
Hadn't you heard? Tebow.
My iPhone 5 is still in my heart.
"The list isn’t half bad. It generally follows prestige, no rank seems outlandish (although some people may take issue to public schools being in top 15), and shows you how the establishment and students think of a college.

I’d say every college here fits within a 3 spot radius up or down."

I have to say the iPhone XR
I also would like to know how this works.

"Knoebel's

EDIT: I should elaborate....  Knoebel's is an amazing park with an experience that you will not get anywhere else.  There are also 2 world class wooden coasters that aren't to be missed *(my non-enthusiast sisters were having a discussion about coasters and the one said that wooden just weren't her thing even though she'll ride them and the other one who had been to knoebel's told her that she would absolutely change her mind after riding those two)* as well as the flying turns which is a neat experience and a fun little steel coaster.  This is also a park that you could stop and spend a few hours at or spend a whole day at and enjoy yourself either way.

My personal opinion on Busch Gardens isn't horrible but when I went a few years ago solely as a coaster/ride enthusiast I really wasn't impressed.  I've found it to be the most expensive in terms of admission, food, merchandise and didn't rise to my expectations.  There isn't a bad ride there and it is a beautiful park but for someone who is/was focused on rides I felt like I was paying for a lot of stuff that I could have easily done without.  There are 2 new coasters since I've been there so maybe that helps and, aside from that, I also want to stress that this isn't saying it's a horrible park because it isn't but it doesn't rate high on my list simply because of what I'm looking for.  I'm far happier stopping at King's Dominion, paying less, and getting a lot more rides."

Been to both sides. You are absolutely right
"From the sound of it OP is a stranger to Japanese games and JRPGs. I second these suggestions, but for people that have only played western games, it might be quite a shock to the system."
"Depends, how much did you like playing through A?  There's a lot to get through if you want to go back and get all the main endings, one of which requires replaying the majority of the game again.  

If you liked playing through Route A, I'd say go for it because C is substantially better.  If you didn't like it, I wouldn't bother though.  I forced myself to push through to ending E just because of all the acclaim (C/D/E all come very close to each other, it's really just 3 playthroughs) and liked almost nothing about the game by the end.  If the story and gameplay aren't at least moderately interesting to you by the end of A, I feel like nothing will really change.  

It's probably not a bad idea to wait a while before jumping back into it, because Route B is a LOT of the same content as A.  It may feel pretty grindy to jump right back in."
"This is my thing too.  But I add some insanely hot foods, chili most often, and night quil.  

My wife hates it.  Says I say some weird stuff in my sleep.  But 80% of the time it works every time."
"Every game on here I really like or at least see the appeal of it if I don't like it.

But I will never understand why people enjoy Food Chain Magnate so much. I just don't get it."
"There was an old lady who gave out goody bags full of mini candy bars, other assorted candies, and small toys (like what you'd get out of a gumball machine) every year."
"I stayed at [Playa Grande](http://playagranderesort.com/) with some friends and it was quite amazing. I have heard of some the all inclusive actually having alcohol in the rooms which this one did not. The pricing was pretty fair. The food was really good. Our tower had a private pool/bar area with a water slide down to a lower level of it. Then there is a series of  massive pools at the ground level right next to its private beach. I am sure, no matter where you stay though, it will be an amazing honeymoon."
