+1 for Power Trip and Gojira
Everyone serious (like a twitch streamer) uses a DSLR camera with micro HDMI plugged into a USB capture card or directly into PCIe slot
"Massage, new coffee maker, coffee, gift card for local coffee shop. Gift card for new clothes, picture frames, homemade coupons for foot rub, back rub, kitchen cleaning, afternoon baby-free, a night out with friends, (not that she should need coupons for this, but I think it's cute anyway.) Fancy shampoo/conditioner/body wash. (I see showers as mini vacations, it's nice to have nice stuff in there.) Printer for baby pictures, magazine subscription, new book by fav author, nice journal."
"I was a valet in college at a very swanky resort. The members had a certain sticker on their car and the owners/partners have a black sticker (which I had no clue) but knew they belonged. When a guy pulled up in a very nice Benz I said, “welcome back (not knowing his name). He was so pissed that I didn’t know who he was, he was an ass to me but I couldn’t care less. Moments later another younger guy pulled up to valet and asked me what the guy said to me. I hesitantly said he was mad I had no idea who he was.  The young guy (looked disappointed) and said “that’s my father and he is an a$$hole, don’t worry about him at all.” Then he gave me $20 to park his car and was extremely nice to every employee who ever interacted with him."
But Rohit doesn't even have a double against Zimbabwe.
"Obvious bias alert, but I wrote [The Data Science Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Handbook-Field-Cady/dp/1119092949) and I think it gives a really unusually good overview of the field, and particularly a lot of practical insights ""from the trenches"".  It's not great for deep dives on particular subjects, but I really do think it's about the best overview you'll find.  Sorry it's a little pricey - that was the publisher's call!"
"Any thoughts and suggestions on which book is the best starting point for Geo Spatial Data analysis. I am mostly looking for QGIS implementation. So before learning the tool, I thought i can get some understanding.

Thanks in Advance."
The lost city of Z is one of the best adventure movies I’ve seen recently
"On the flip side, if you ever fly a plane, get non-polarized lenses. They make it possible to see the avionics displays and the windshield (airplane windows are made with layered acrylic) won’t have a weird wavy rainbow effect.

Don’t even consider polarized lenses. They’re not even worth the $150."
T-his this is some meme long forgotten.... Thank you
Duuude...
"Hey there, me again. I am going to be needing a new laptop more urgently than expected as I was laid off this morning and will need a new computer for job hunting.

Doesn’t seem like waiting for the Asus Zenbook 13 with i7 and 1TB SSD is a wise move, unless it comes back in stock shortly. Do you have any similar recommendations that may be more widely available? Any that I can by in-store this week would be ideal.

Do you think that perhaps I should look for a less expensive model?"
Moderation dudes. Moderation.
Maybe under Satya it could have been
"If you feel this way, you should start some personal projects or find another job.  All industries need CS.  

As an example for biomedical - in the next decade all or most of the medical equipment is going to be replaced by smart tech that detects symptoms via classification algorithms. 

If you are doing computer science right, you will arguably contribute more to the world than any other industry."
"Got my associates in General Studies, then got my Bachelors in American Studies. Changed my life ."
"Used to do that, but the awkwardness of mounting it at the right height, setting it up, opening the apps..

and needing to use the damn phone, i quickly stopped using it."
At least 3 dickloads... or 2 buttloads
"Hah, I guess it did.  It was mostly because I had to rebuild a 25 foot fence section, and part of it had a big phone junction box right down the middle of the property line, so I had to cut the pickets to fit around it."
"I had Rodgers higher, but did not have mahomes higher as I felt Watson was nearly as good with far less help."
"One of the PFF guys was on Purple Inside with Matthew Coller and basically said ""his one year indicates he is top two at his position but everyone ahead of him has done that as well"".  They don't even have him in their top Wrs."

"I am partial to Pat McAfee. Not to borrow from the side bar but I assume Gronk is a cool guy. 

I base this all on off the field coolness."
Black and white is an excellent start. It was something like a soft reset of the series and is widely considered one of the best in the franchise
