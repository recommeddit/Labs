14974,"I am on a perennial search for something that hits the same spot as Cruisie! If you like Regency, Georgette Heyer's heroines are smart and capable. Historical, I'd have to go with Laura Kinsale. For contemporary, I've had luck with Jill Mansell and Catherine Alliott, who are both British writers. Alliott's Rosie Meadows Regrets is one of my favorites! Katie Fforde is another British writer who I've liked. And ooh Meg Cabot!
