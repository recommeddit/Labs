23980,best anime,Rent-a-girlfriend top 10 really??? I agree
50601,best rap album,"All the early Dre production has held up incredibly well over the years. The Chronic, Doggystyle, All Eyez On Me, 2001, SSLP, MMLP... 

That said I am always blown away by how crisp Doggystyle is. Top to bottom it can go up against anything new and never show it's age."
29471,best game console,"The Legend of Dragoon (PS1)

Shadow of the Colossus (PS2)

Harvest Moon 64 (N64)

Animal Crossing (GameCube)

Steel Battalion (Xbox)"
71089,best movies with a cool twist,Oooo that is a good one!!!! Forgot about that one.
59192,best perfume,"Paradise by Nest. I bought it because someone at a resturant was wearing it and I had to ask what it was. It's amazing, but not too ""sexy"". Like a mix of sexy, fresh and floral."
13779,best research paper archive,"Which rule? The ""no dead people"" rule?"
51382,best iphone case,Way too slick. Easy to clean though.
56867,best water brand,Fiji water washes over me like the cool waters of Lake Minnetonka
71943,best movies with a cool twist,Arrival is a wonderful film and I think Denis Villeneuve is one of the most exciting filmmakers around atm.
12645,best gifts for mom,"> the clothes that don‚Äôt fit b/c you‚Äôre growing up so fast

My mom never had to worry about that, because I am a manlet.  My nephew just had his first birthday and I can't wait for his hand-me-downs."
69005,best science fiction novel,I love Flood! The inevitability is gripping.
62977,Best Data Science textbook,"it was a [humble-bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) package.  They put together digital content packages and basically give them away for a really low price, to support a charity.

edit:  I think they were recently bought out by someone.  hopefully not E.A."
6409,best Netflix documentary,"[My Brother Jordan](https://youtu.be/ryEq5Yov2G0) is an indie documentary I found on Youtube one day and it absolutely wrecked me. It's a beautiful documentary about life, death, and brotherhood. I highly recommend it to anyone that has an hour to spare and probably want to cry."
51724,best iphone case,Pitaka squad checking in.
46321,best trick or treating candy,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful answers! Yeah, I might be worried too much over nothing. But while I haven't experienced Halloween, I have seen it a lot in the movies (like ET for example). Of course the movie trick-or-treating scenes are probably more exciting than the real thing, but I may have built up an expectation over the event. I'm really excited though!

I don't mind so much the actual TPing as the thought behind it. I don't mind cleaning up, but I don't want kids to dislike my house because I gave out crappy candy."
12375,best gifts for mom,The Target babies are of marginally higher quality. The Walmart ones are like those ‚Äúsurprise inside‚Äù toys so it‚Äôs a mystery what you get.
69708,best major to study in college,Yuuuuup. The S part of STEM is a pretty big trap nowadays...
37391,best amusement park,"I agree, and I work at Kennywood for Phantom Fright Nights. Their outside ""scare zones"" and haunts are top-notch. They can't do full-park theming because they're open all day, but at night, when the monsters come out... They're exceptional!"
38063,best Marvel movie,"this is actually wrong, percentage of positive reviews has nothing to do with how good a movie is, it should be sorted by average critic rating, or just metacrtic score  
like you can have a movie with 100% on RT but all could be 6/10s would you consider that movie better than one with 400 9-10 and 8 4/10 would put it on 98%"
14974,best romantic novel,"I am on a perennial search for something that hits the same spot as Cruisie! If you like Regency, Georgette Heyer's heroines are smart and capable. Historical, I'd have to go with Laura Kinsale. For contemporary, I've had luck with Jill Mansell and Catherine Alliott, who are both British writers. Alliott's Rosie Meadows Regrets is one of my favorites! Katie Fforde is another British writer who I've liked. And ooh Meg Cabot! Her books aren't very... deep, and lean YA, but she has a bunch of non-YA standalones too."
53231,best usb c charging cable,"Nomad makes theirs with Kevlar.  I have their universal cable and usb-c v Cable with Kevlar, it‚Äôs crazy robust."
19658,best YouTube video,Surprised I had to scroll down this far to see this. Shoes was great
2,best terminal file manager reddit,Same + shell aliases
60408,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Daaamn!! I checked on IMDB, they have 6 seasons out üòê watched some of it last night with my brother had us in tears, they sooo quick it‚Äôs crazy just a massive roast session, love it! Thank you for the top recommendation what a champ"
26394,best politician,"the crack isnt ther eason, its all his actions after"
