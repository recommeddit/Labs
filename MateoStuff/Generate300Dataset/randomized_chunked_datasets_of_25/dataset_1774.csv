36971,"I would go MM, have been to MM, grAm, and SFoT is my home park. I visited mm on saturday with fright fest so only got to do half the rides, but it was a cool place. 

One of only gripes with sfot is that part of it is like a maze, i still havent figured out how to efficiently get from new texas giant to the gotham section. All the shops and what not look similar, and the signs that point to which rides are ambiguous at intersections of multiple pathways. Dont get me started about the entrance to titan, at least i can now laugh at all the people missing the lack of proper signage when you turn by el aserradero.

Although the view of the parking lot from titan is outstanding, but scream at mm is in a parking lot so it wins there /s",best roller coaster at six flags
