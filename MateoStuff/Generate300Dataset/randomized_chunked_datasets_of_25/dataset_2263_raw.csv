"I prefer Home Depot. I fucking love the electronic receipts they do, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable enough. I find Lowe’s is a bit higher priced."
I like my Dell S2415H
NFS heat and payback are like that but physics are nothing like gran turismo so you might dislike it
"Up until the last panel, Piglet just looks like he's so done with Pooh's shit.

""Aww c'mon Pooh, this is the third time this week you've done this""."
"In the red bean ice cream I've had, they're soft beans mashed up a bit- not chunky at all, though. Azuki beans are sweet, so they make a great tasting ice-cream flavor. There are actually a couple Japanese treats that put azuki beans in pastries, sometimes shaped like fish (not sure why, though)."

I heard this time Asians have  larger.
"I'm just saying an actual lock would be better, because any luggage thief worth their salt would have a key for those locks. Especially in the US."
Crazy to see Tenchi slide in for the 100th spot.
"Have you driven an EV? I love the instant response of EVs, the ability to do one-pedal driving on twisty, challenging roads without even lifting your foot off the accelerator is sublime. The Model 3 is the best corner carver I've ever driven because it lacks the drama of the engine, the shifting, the braking. You're one with the machine, steering, accelerating, focusing. Not getting distracted by noise and vibration."
Sexian. Watch yer goddamn tone.
"Seriously OP, what made you even consider SA?"
"Late twenties to late thirties F. Arcane and specialized hobbies. Too academic for tarot, but you know your crystals. 

You  have a wood preference for furniture."
"Poster board, primed, would have been close enough for me. I'm not the one that wanted to choose between a dozen colours, though!

We did a test swatch only to see if we needed to prime the walls before changing the colour. Builder beige actually showed through and darkened the new colour, so we primed.

I can see what you mean about the surfaces, as I also painted a sheet of MDF in the room colour. It backs a bookcase. I sanded it, primed it, painted it two coats. It is very smooth, and it looks very close, but pleasingly brighter, good for the back wall of a bookcase."
Guy Fieri was great. He gets so much criticism but seems like actually just a cool dude that is passionate about good food.
"dartmouth has always been number 1 undergrad for like the last 5 years, but slipped a bit a year ago, still is 4th best ivy"
do you have a garage?  if it's warm when you leave you might cut that in half :)
Author?
"I am referring to the pointy legs that occupy desk space and are not flat. Normally, monitor stand is flat and is located directly under the centre of the screen. It also occupies much less space."
Need for speed underground 2 is still the best for progression.
Right? I was surprised by that and Silverwood.

Membership in one of the two parties. You are pretty much done after that.
A cast iron skillet. It’s a super versatile piece of cookware that if taken care of properly will last a lifetime.
