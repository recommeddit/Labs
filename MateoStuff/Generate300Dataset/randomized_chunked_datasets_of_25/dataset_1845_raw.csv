"Whatever you do: if you (and I mean *you* as the adults in the family) do not want a dog and feel fully prepared to take care of one, do not get one. Just don't. People vastly underestimate how hard dogs can be to care for, and a fence is not the only problem. And people also vastly underestimate the costs associated with a dog. 

The first few months after my husband and I adopted a puppy were literally harder than the first few months of having a human child. And that nearly-free dog had over $5,000 in vet bills the first year we had her. Sure, that might not happen in every case, but you never know, it can. So if you don't want a dog, don't get one. Give your kid other opportunities to interact with animals, whether that's volunteering at a shelter if any in your area have programs for young kids, taking horseback riding lessons, or if you have a friend or neighbor with a pet, perhaps seeing if they can arrange for her to spend some time with the pet."
"A clean record. No crimes, no pictures of illicit activity on social media, nothing."
"I hate to bother you, but do you have any advice on how to get started and find clients? Especially for option 1, while I work on option 2?"

What tier is ethanol?
Not sure if I can answer your question on stretchiness but I can tell you that the fly knit material is extremely durable. I have a pair that I've had for 18 months that the fabric still looks almost as good as new with no tears anywhere.
"Per your original question - I would NOT recommend the Whites if you don’t have experience. They will whip your butt. The Smokies in August will be just fine. Most of the AT in the south would be fine in August. It’ll be hot, but no hotter than July or September. Just be sure to drink lots of water, bring salty foods and/or electrolyte powder, and above all, practice good LNT practices no matter where and when you go. 

Also get the tiny bottle of 99% deet and treat your clothes with permethrin. Ticks are nothing to mess around with!"
"TWiV and TWiM might be a bit hard to get into unless you have read a few primary research papers in your studies. It's basically a journal club format and, even though they have a lot of listeners who are non-scientists, I think you'd have to have a solid foundation in these topics to justify putting so much time into listening to them. TWiP is a bit more layperson-friendly, and their diagnosis game is great, so I would perhaps start with that. That's also the most medicine-oriented one since one of the hosts is a practicing physician, while all the hosts on TWiV and TWiM are research scientists, so I'd say TWiP is the best one to start with for someone looking to be a Physician's Assistant. I would just start at the beginning, but if you don't have that much time, you can start with episode 80 which is when the physician (Daniel Griffin) joined the podcast and they started doing the diagnosis game thing.

I haven't missed an episode of any of these podcasts in 3-4 years. I recently (actually, almost 2 months ago) wrote in to TWiV but my email hasn't been read out yet - anyone else had this experience? Not sure what to think of it, I'm sure they are getting tons of email especially now with the Zika hubbub."
"I'd go with Blue Smoke or Daisy's over Dinosaur in NYC, easily. I've only been to Dinosaur once, so it might not be fair to judge but I wasn't impressed."
"I'm so glad I found this post/subreddit. I'm in a similar situation in that I have a decent job, yet unsatisfying and doesn't pay well enough for the long haul. I have some school under my belt, but want to finish my undergrad in CS now, hopefully with a software development focus.

I've been doing a lot of self-learning, but now that I qualify for my employers' tuition reimbursement program I want to take advantage of that. But I don't just want a piece of paper from a ""diploma mill."" I want to be challenged and actually *learn* whole I'm in school (novel, I know).

But the only way I see it working is online. I'll be working full time and have a baby on the way. But it's so hard to judge an online school before enrolling. Every school has such polarizing reviews. And aside from that, there are just so many factors to consider.

But I'm going to look into some of these schools listed. This is why I like Reddit…"
I had to write a paper on it in class
"At least at a entry level transposing chords (even more if you think of simples chords) think chords on tha shapes of E, A or D, power chords, you can just move you hands up and down without changing anything. Piano every chords have a slightly diferent ""shape"", really easy To do anything in C major but you have to do some more thinking To get the notes On piano even though i find single notes can be easier To find on the keybed. As a experienced player is a diferent story and when you are used To it it probably gets as easy or easier with the added bonus of more acessible voicings. 
But i think is A thing that is up for debate."
There’s plenty of characters you can choose to kill or not. Not talking about bosses.
I don't know much about monitors but my cousin owns a 27GL850 and he is in love with it
"Creed Aventus, Dior Sauvage, and Bleu de Chanel EDT have been good compliment getters for me. Personally, I wear the fragrances for myself, but the compliments are just icing on the cake."
“Don’t drink and drive” *sips Capri Sun*
No you dont. You cant even sympathize with a few bosses and keep them alive instead youre always forced to kill them when you meet them
"[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHISh559oho) is okay, but I wish they'd put up a video with the dye you mentioned.  Hell, I wish they'd do more videos like this for the public in general (and make them available on the internet)."
"Couldn’t have said it better myself!  

And yes to Aura for ultra  deep and clear base tints!  IMO, this is where Aura shines!"
"Hershey and Mars candy used to be delicious. Now it's all cheap and gross, overly sweet with nil chocolate.
I'd rather have flavorful hard candy, any day. However, to this day I could drive to the exact house where a lady gave out bananas one year. We were so depressed. They were past ripe, and more fit for baking."
"Having great coasters is great, if you can ride them.

Long lines and closed coasters prevented me from doing that, even over two days at CP. Gemini, TTD, Rougarou, Blue Streak, and Wicked Twister were all closed. Millennium Force, Maverick, and Steel Vengeance were hour to 2 hour waits even on a ticket system. 

I'm not saying it's not a good park, or that I won't give it another shot. I'm saying if I had the option of going to one park over the other, I'm going to the park where I can actually ride things."
"Long live ASAP, I'm on my phone... His SECOND album that is. Close second would be midnight marauders, powers is the man"
I think you should worry about anything sold only for cash and no receipt.
