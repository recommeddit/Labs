Sams club is owned by Walmart which is why it’s sanitizer is on the list.
"I don't think it's fair to attribute the lack of immigration reform to Obama's failing, Congress has been completely deadlocked and unwilling to put anything forward."
"I have hardly heard of anyone using Go for backend. NET core, PHP, Node, Python you hear about often, but Go? Not so much."
"It was perfect for me because there's a theater about 10 minutes driving, but they just dropped it from the app so I cancelled. The rest are way too far and they're AMC so I'm thinking of using their service instead."
Ever try Ace Pineapple Cider? Oh so good!
"I had a home built in the '60s, all original. Green kitchen appliances. Yellow, gold glittered counters and floor. Wood panel walls. Pink toilet. Red-orange carpet. Stained spongy ceiling tiles. Mirrors everywhere.

Disgustingly ugly all around. But I loved that green kitchen."
"Couldn't disagree with this more.

Have done 2 all inclusive trips to Punta Cana and 1 to Cancun and only turned 30 the day before yesterday.  Forget Cancun.  Punta Cana is a great time (and I've also been lucky enough to do Grand Cayman, Grenada and travel much of the rest of the world).

The question is what do you expect out of an all-inclusive?  Are you looking for motorized watersports?  Diving?  Trips?  

In my mind the best part of an all inclusive trip is this:  you know what you are going to pay. If you go to PC you know the food is going to be just fine and your drinks are going to be free.  The value of not having to pull your wallet out nonstop is pretty much invaluable.  

Majestic Colonial and Excellence in PC were pretty darn nice.  The Excellence also have an adults only area which is great.

One other caveat - the above depends entirely on your budget.  If you can spend $3k/person for a week, screw the all inclusive and go to Asia.  If you want to do $3k all in, then try the all inclusive...."
"As long as it’s got fluoride and not charcoal it’s good. 

Spit don’t rinse, the whole point of using paste is cleaning then leaving tooth protective stuff on your teeth, rinsing washes it off! It’s like putting your coat on to keep warm to go out to not get wet then taking it off when you go outside! It’s a habit hard to kick if you are used to it!

It’s the technique that makes a difference. Where the gum meets the tooth (front and back) twice a day for 2 mins and in between with interdental brushes/ floss once a day. 

Electric brushes with pressure sensors and timers make brushing piss easy and can even be enjoyable. Change heads every 3 months like you should be doing with your brush anyway and if it’s wearing too quickly you need to be more gentle.

Also if you have to use mouthwash, (preferably with fluoride in) use it 30 mins after brushing or during the day, you don’t want to wash off what you just spent 2 mins putting on!

Note- am dental nurse not dentist but give oral health advise most days"
"If you are a fan of SAO watch Log horizon, its like sao but focuses more on mechanics of the game which they are trapped it. 
IMO a better take on the ""Stuck in videogame"" trope"
Did he ask you to yell at the moon with him?
This and dristan nasal spray are staples in my home. I hate nasal congestion.
"Isn't stuff like multipart-forms / file uploads, query string building etc a bit of a hassle with only fetch?"
I never understand why people pay to have there bags travel wrapped. Surely it just looks like you have something to hide? As long as you have travel insurance you’re covered anyway.

Fuck Authority, kids! :)"
"I'm currently reading the Draconis Memoria series by Anthony Ryan (starting with the Waking Fire), and I think that could potentially be a great fit. It's set in a pseudo Victorian-era timeframe (think East India Trading Company) and includes well-written dragons, magic, corporate espianage, pirates, ancient relics, and tons of adventures in a huge number of locations (from deserts to forests to polar ice caps and even a prison city).

The final book in the trilogy is coming out this summer (I mistakenly thought it was complete when I started reading it), but I'm really enjoying it so far."
I love the subtle watermarks. It's like a little game finding them

"In addition to the albums that are named over and over again on these kinds of threads, I would add:

Fugees\- The Score

Dynospectrum\- The Dynospectrum

JMT\- Violent By Design

Nas\- Hip\-Hop is Dead (IMO this album is criminally underrated)

Cypress Hill\- Temples of Boom

Skitzofreniks\- Enter The Realm

Gangstarr\- Hard to Earn

Big L\- Lifestylez Ov Da Poor &  Dangerous

Eric B. & Rakim\- Paid in Full

Big Pun\- Capital Punishment

Bonus (what I'm listening to currently):

Pusha T\- Daytona

Royce Da 5'9\- The Book of Ryan

My choices are based on being able to put the album on and not have to skip any tracks from start to finish."
Omg I was just joking! Why can't you take a joke!!?????????
"This what I was going to suggest too.  It's a lovely film but fills me with both great sadness and happiness.  Not a massive 'mindfuck', but until you understand the film you're not sure what is real and what isn't.

I think I need to watch it again, it's been a while."
Its so underrated bro. Literally have never ever seen anyone mentioning it in any conversation ever. Rise up fellow gamer
Yeah that’s what got me hooked
