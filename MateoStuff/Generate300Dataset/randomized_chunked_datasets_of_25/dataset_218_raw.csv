I got a lightly used Nvidia 2060S off of a dude on OfferUp for $300.  I am not disappoint.
"Erlend √òye

I went to his gig in Oaktown one night, and the next night went to SF for some dance music.  He happened to be there, just for fun, not to perform.  I recognized him from the night before, pointed at him, and gave him my ""OMG it's you"" face.  He stopped where he was, pointed at me, and gave me my ""OMG it's you"" face.  Being made fun of was never more hilarious."
"I love Steve1989MREinfo. The dude is super into his reviews, has a great calm presence, regularly saves pieces of his MRE to share with other MRE enthusiasts, and i also find a lot of the reviews really interesting. I think he cane out with another review yesterday too!"
Wreckfest. Great combo of fluid physics with arcade demolition derby no holds barred fun.

"I work in business intelligence and analytics now.  It was a wild ride, though.  I started out working in a greenhouse, and was promoted to manager there.  Moved from managing that to a movie theater.  Once I learned something about financials, I went to work for a college as a financial aid counselor.  Plan was to get a higher degree, but I started helping out a coworker that did our IT and report writing.  He taught me about writing reports in a few different technology stacks.  He got a promotion, and pulled me into his department to work with him full time on reporting.  I moved again after a couple of years to work for a major university's fundraising branch and ran a team there.  Now I'm building a business intelligence department from the ground up for a healthcare company.

All to say- Get a job, any job, then network, remember how people work, and forge your own path.  Accepting a job does not force you into that company for any longer than you want it to.  You only owe an employer what time they've paid you for.  Once you find a chance to move up, grab it."

"Some good 1440p 144hz monitors are the
LG 27GL850-B (IPS)
Viewsonic VX2758-2KP-MHD (IPS)
ASUS TUF VG27AQ (IPS)
AOC CQ27G2 (VA)

The Viewsonic and AOC monitors are the budget option, being cheaper than the LG and ASUS monitors.

Imo, it all depends on your budget, I'm probaly picking the AOC monitor myself because it's dirt cheap compared to the other option in my country."
"> my nominations are so long-winded that I'm a little embarrassed.

You should be embarrassed, or proud... I would go with the latter.üòâ"
"Haha, classic.  You reused some consoles, but I appreciated it nonetheless."
"Cydia is still *‚Äùking of the hill‚Äù*, but it's not maintaned by anyone and it will slowly deteriorate to an unusable state.

Zebra and Installer 5 are two promising new package managers that are still pretty buggy and can‚Äôt fully replace Cydia yet.

There's also Sileo, which looks like the Appstore, but that‚Äôs all it has going for it."

"Met Viggo Mortensen quite a handful of times as he used to go to the restaurant I managed at the time. 

He was one of the nicest, most down to earth celebrities we had. He would, after we offered, join us for dinner once the restaurant had closed and would bring small gifts every time for everyone."
Everyone's talking about axios! Is there anyone who  using ajax from RxJS ? let me know im not alone :(
I thought about that.  I'm going to do it this week.  I'd appreciate any other ideas or pranks.  Things get boring sometimes.
