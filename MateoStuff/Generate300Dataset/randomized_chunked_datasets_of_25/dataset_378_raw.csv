"“The garden is beautiful but the walls grow ever higher” lol. I actually like the walled garden and see it as a plus in my opinion. Less fragmentation, a unified ecosystem. All of Apples products work seamlessly together. I don’t get the criticism against Apples closed system."
Cable ties can be easily defeated and returned to their original position without any signs of tampering.
"The point is that once enough people give their opinion, it should provide a close estimate. It only doesn’t work when people decide to shit on it for no reason, like emoji movie that was a better than average kids movie."
"so u can see how much bias is there ...

Ritz Carleton club level in New Orleans.
"There's too many cool things in WV to list, but I'd recommend checking out the campus of one of our many colleges (WVU or WVSU are my personal favorites), seeing the Greenbrier, or being cliche and going to the Capitol building. Any of these will give at least a taste of the fascinating stuff we have to offer.

Edit: We also have a lot of weird high school mascots. Mine was a Poca Dot!"
"I feel bad talking shit about my degree. But Biomedical engineering. 

Maybe not *avoid* it, but make sure you have an idea of what you like at the beginning or early as possible, and tailor your work experience, classes, training, etc. to that specialty.

For example, if you like prosthetics, have things that show you are ready to compete with Mechanical and Electrical engineers over the same position, and that your biology/anatomy knowledge gives you an edge over them. 

All other engineers have obvious fields they can go into. Biomed is simply just not as fleshed out and employees may just pick grads with majors they fully understand. 

In my undergrad, I went more of the bioinformatics route and did a lot of coding, so I load up my resume with that stuff and had 2 internships that furthered my coding ability. But would it have been easier if I just did Computer Engineering? Possibly."
MM.. FOOD

Competing resorts/hotels are known for posting bad reviews which can make it hard to identify real ones. The middle of the road ones or ones with photos are the best bet usually.
"The U.S hasn't declared war since WWII. Technically, there hasn't been a ""war"" since the 40's."
"That's exactly why I really enjoyed last year's Tomb Raider. It was a pretty fun and exciting adventure movie with a likable lead character. I seem to be in the minority with that opinion, but if you haven't seen it, I'd recommend giving it a try."
"Wow, I can't believe I've never heard about that! And finally a non-american film recommended to me! I always find them interesting, for example The invisible guest is Spanish and it was very very surprising. I'm gonna watch this first out of all recommendations and I will let you know what I think about it! Thank you! :)"
"This is what my mother said translated to English, 

>""I don't want anything son. All I want, all I work for is for you to be successful so I can finally take a break. (But I do want some new boots).""


Edit: I guess I really have to get those boots now. Have a Merry Christmas season."
"Taking the time to have diner together. She’s not materialistic. In fact, she is actually thankful when you don’t bother her with the obligation and headache of buying you something"
"Kashmir, really?  What's the work out?  Casually walking down the street?"
"UC schools have historically been for high school graduates with a higher GPA/academic performance while CalState is for the rest. That's a generalization, but the competitiveness/comparison in admission rate btwn the 2 school systems reflects the reality.

My friends compared as we either came from UC or CalState, and the consensus was that UC has more academic/research in nature, while CalState has more practical course work."
"For something a little different (and unforgetable), try Montreal and Quebec City. Quebec girls are the hottest in North America and Montreal nightlife is awesome."

"I used to have one that was just called *Cuban Gold*, it came in a tin and was shaped like a cigar. Very nice scent, very masculine and according to my exes and wife, very swell day. Not too strong, but not weak either. Always got compliments from the ladies"
"Since it uses XHR under the hood, there are one or two things you can do with Axios that you can't do (yet) with fetch, like upload progress.

Also the Axios API is a bit friendlier in general, fetch is more of a mid-level abstraction - it's fine for trivial stuff but once you move past that it gets a bit verbose/awkward and you end up writing your own wrapper(s) anyway.

Also fetch is a browser API, if you want it in Node you have to use a library (node-fetch) anyway.

That being said I stick with fetch too."
