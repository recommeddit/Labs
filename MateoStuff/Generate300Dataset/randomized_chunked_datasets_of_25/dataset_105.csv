27540,"Thanks, but I don't think I like five films of a single actor enough to list them. Bollywood movies these days are beyound my comprehension. I would rather watch the villian explaining all his plans to a tied hero and leave him to die near a time bomb than a frail guy kicking 20 guys, each thrice his size, allover like a football. This and all that CGI stuff don't seem real to me. The film should just flow infront of you..

Still there are some bollywood movies that I can watch again and again. Here are some of them-

Guide, Jewel Thief, Sholay, Don (1978), Pyasa, Parineeta (1953), Garam Hawa, Agneepath (1990), Namak Haram, Chupke Chupke, Sanghrash (1968), Angoor, Khakee, Shakti, New Delhi Times, Pratiggya..

There will be more but only these are coming to mind right now.",best bollywood actor

37587,"Sadly, yup. I kept telling people on this sub and on r/movies that they do not understand just how much the general audience loved Black Panther. My wife has no love for comic stuff like me and she went to see that movie 3 times. My mom, who probably never saw a superhero movie in her life, went to go see it twice. 

It’s a flawed movie, maybe not the best MCU flick by our standards, but the average person off the street loves it tremendously. I don’t even fully understand why it resonated so well with people from all races and countries, but it’s quite miraculous.",best Marvel movie

Horizon 
Persona 5
Nier: Automata 
Transistor

I see some people say Horizon isn't an RPG.

Cases for:

Well you level up
Every upgrade you can craft and unlock most of before you manage 50% through the story.

Game is very open ended, if you can knock level 20 characters at 10, good for you.  It's a bit easy to cheese some enemies.

Includes magic: in the form of 
Ice, shock, fire, corruptions on arrows. It's not directly ""magic"" but you get my point. 

Has a few ""dungeons"" in the form of cauldrons but this my weakest point. 


Multiple weapons but they are mostly projectile 

Very similar to Witcher. You use a bow instead of sword.  Shorter too. The map is condensed beautifully.",Best RPG game on PS4
