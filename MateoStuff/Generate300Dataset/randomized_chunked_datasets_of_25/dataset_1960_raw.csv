"I find that the weight-reward/convenience ratio for big powerbanks are quite poor. My setup is MacBook pro 15inch, iPad Pro 12,9 inch and an iPhone X. All of them have fantastic battery life and:


1. I rarely work from spots without power for a longer amount of time than the battery cycles of my devices.

2. There is no flight time on the planet that my iPad’s battery can’t outlast when watching a realistic amount of movies.

2. Half a KG is excessive for a ""what-if"" item.


Perhaps a tiny powerbank for a 1-iPhone charge wouldn’t be bad of an investment to have for those rare occasions when you get to a new country and realize you don’t have enough battery to find your Airbnb because you’ve been using your phone to listen to podcasts all day.

No real world scenario has ever left me thinking ""damn, should have brought a 20.000+ mah power bank...""



I invested in a good charging station instead that fast charge all my devices and has a cable extension. I love it. It’s the Hyper Juice 87 watt with dual usb c PD and a single usb a 18w."
That's correct. It isn't rough at all in the front

But I really miss the Cold War. The US had an enemy that we could easily point to on a map. Us vs Them. The Olympics were also more interesting."

"Actually, I think that one of the strengths is that it covers a wide range of research topics explained at a nice level. the chapters kind of read like a final exam study guide. So if you are familiar with the subject, it’s full of nuggets you may have forgotten. I personally love it"

Hope that clarifies."
Any other recommendations?

"That late 90's might honestly be the best one, but is probably the most forgotten one due to missing penalties, people think about Ronaldo's Brazil and Zidane's France, but I genuinly think the Dutch team was the best those years, the strikers we have at the moment would struggle to make the top 10 list of Dutch strikers those years"
How do you pronounce this>? (so I don't look like a moron when I order it)

">Guitar is easier To transpose

I have played piano since I was a kid; I know scales in every key, so transposing is a breeze. Guitar for me - not so much. Capo is how I transpose on a guitar!"

I love having a console a couple generations old. Cheap games! Waiting for the bottom to fall out of the 3ds market right now...

"Need some help guys. I’m looking at picking up a Samsung g7 for gaming but  not sure if I should get the 27” or 32” 

Any suggestions? 

The sharpness loss in the 32” is what’s keeping me from getting the 32”

TIA"
"For Afghanistan, the minute we started bombing, the Taliban actually offered to extradite Osama to a third party country for a trial. Bush turned them down, however, saying that he knew that Osama was guilty, virtually saying that he didn't deserve a trial."
