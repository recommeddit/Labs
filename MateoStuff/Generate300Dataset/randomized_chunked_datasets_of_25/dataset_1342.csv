31332,"It's not that easy. I'm an American living in Scandinavia, and things are not that simple. Wish I could elaborate, but on my phone right now.

To give you some examples of missing conveniences, Amazon same-day, beer growlers, Uber, ubiquitous corner stores, cheap and tasty restaurants and food carts on every block, places that are open late so you can go after work. Things a lot of people in Sweden and Norway aren't even aware exist.

In terms of integrating, being able to use English is nice but doesn't bridge the culture gap completely.

Don't gut me wrong, it's a nice place to live and I'm glad I moved, but it's not that simple.",best country to live in

72658,"Very nice review, great read. It has great humor which makes it easy and fun to read.

I don't own all mice you mentioned, but I agree on many things you've said. I also would recommend the XM1 to almost any type of claw. This mouse is seriously the best mouse I have ever used for said grip.

People need to take into account a mouse works best with X grip. I play pure fingertip grip, so unlike your opinion, I do like small and ultra light weight mice. At 19x9.5cm I like the Model O-. I'd probably like the UL2 too (maybe even more since it feels smaller in hand I've read).

Hoping for that XM1 mini or a XM mouse with a bigger hump to use knuckle claw with!",best wireless lightweight mouse

Not to give any spoilers to anyone but geez the time factor in the episode you mentioned is what had me fucked up the most. Also White Bear, and Shut up and Dance. Wow! I kinda wish I could go back and watch it all over again not knowing anything.",best movies with a cool twist

It can happen where there is no abusive intent, for example when the husband lacks empathy skills. [Here is an example so common the therapist made a composite story of it ](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/married-with-undiagnosed-autism-why-women-who-leave-lose-twice-0420164)

""When he does not acknowledge her birthday, and she asserts that his behavior has upset her, he may respond that he did not mean to upset her; therefore, she shouldn‚Äôt be upset. Or he might tell her that because birthdays come once year and everyone has them, they are no big deal and she should stop making such a big deal about them. Or he could tell her they celebrated her birthday last year. Or that birthdays are for children. In other words, he may hold her to the same idea regarding birthdays he holds himself. ""

""She does it because it is important to her, for example, that the children‚Äôs birthdays are celebrated. She wants them to have fun. She wants them to have one special day a year that is all about them. She sees this as normal.

Daddy doesn‚Äôt agree, so he doesn‚Äôt participate.""

""Mommy does it all, from the planning to the present buying to the cake decorating, at home or at the bakery. She chats with all the parents who bring their own children to celebrate. She cleans up after the party. She is exhausted. She says so. Her husband may respond by saying, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre the one who had to have this big party! You asked for it.‚Äù He may not help with the cleanup because, well, it was ‚Äúher idea to have the party.‚Äù

""...She is not thinking the children learn how to treat their mother by observing the way their father treats her."" 

""She is operating on the assumption her children know her and love her and they see she is a good person. She is unaware that negative lifelong attitudes toward her are being formed in the young minds of the children she loves so dearly...""",best gifts for mom
