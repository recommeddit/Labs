69231,best major to study in college,"Majored in chemical engineering.

Kid Toasty always wanted to make video games. I think I'd go back for computer science/art double major. People say, ""If you love video games, don't get a job making them."" Adult Toasty isn't finding that same spark when playing video games but the idea of making imagination into reality is still there."
54083,best medicine for a cold,"water and fever.
Fever goes up, bring it down. Then let it go up again. And then bring it down. Just try not to let it get too high, and your cold leaves faster.

also, it only works if you have a fever"

33555,best electric car,"> but only the model which costs a lot more

The Model Y Standard Range isn't technically sold (though apparently you can get them if you call) and doesn't have a price.  All Model Y's have the long range battery.  The 60 kWh is only sold on the Model 3.

And yeah, I don't understand the quibbling here.  Indeed per numbers at ev-database the Tesla charging system sinks about 70% more power, or (because of somewhat higher efficiency) 86% higher rate of  recovered range.  The article seems spot on to me.  The ID.4 isn't really that impressive as a vehicle, but a crossover at $40k is pretty attractive for a lot of market segments.

That's not completely surprising for a vehicle that costs 30% more."

68795,best science fiction novel,New sun and snow crash below neuromancer... heresy!
36654,best alcoholic drink,Oh yes I get mad when the bartender doesn‚Äôt give me one üò©
33221,best electric car,You have tons of freedom with CCS. I am selling my Model 3 for a Mustang Mach-E and there will be no reduction of my freedom. Not everyone lives where CCS sucks and Tesla is good.
1804,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Marty‚Äôs on De La Vina is a hidden gem!! They do takeout only I think but have THE BEST classic flavorful pizza
26867,best board games,Everything is number one?
2896,best headphones,If u want gaming go full on Sennheiser. Honestly most of their gaming headphones sound pretty much the same. I am not aware of their top headphones for gaming but few years back Game zero was above average and still is a good choice.
36804,best alcoholic drink,Moscow mule! So tasty
37481,best amusement park,True. But King‚Äôs Island has had the better last decade.
57911,best cologne,Was very surprised by the quality of Diesel colognes. If Only the Brave wasn't in such a ridiculous bottle I think it would sell very well.
69580,best major to study in college,"Without study abroad??? **Noooooooo. **

Heck, I did a language *minor* and some of my classmates complained that it‚Äôs not printed on the degree so they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù put it on their resume for some prestige. I‚Äôve brought many to light that if your language skills are good enough you *can* put [Language - Proficiency], and that you don‚Äôt have to put it on if you can‚Äôt speak the language anymore.

And congrats with your studies!"
52212,best hiphop album,Being genre defining has nothing to do with how long it‚Äôs been released for. There‚Äôs albums newer than Pi√±ata that are already genre defining like TPAB or even Culture by Migos.
37972,best Marvel movie,"Yes, if you remove the morality, character dynamics, social relevance, plot, sympathy, real-world meaning, and impetus for the art itself, you're left with a bad film. As every film would be.

&#x200B;

Remove the politics from Iron Man and what do you have? Rich guy makes a suit I guess. Snore."

43699,best items under $100,"Seconded.    

It is a very high quality port of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, and works much better on touch than I would have imagined. The only IAPs it has is three expansion sets (Wacky Worlds, Time Twister, and Toolkit), which I'd call optional.   

It is kind of the polar opposite of most mobile games, no annoying ads, no conveyor belt of ""challenges"", limited & valuable IAPs, and deep gameplay."
9977,best portable charger,That range is pretty extreme.
4800,best home improvement store,"We have both, one across from the other. The Lowe's is smaller then a typical one and not arranged like most Lowe's. 


Every time I have walked in there (over a dozen times) they don't have what I need. Infuriating. I went in there in the dead of winter to buy a zone control. I needed three zones but I could get by with one. They literally do not carry any in the store. Single zone included. You've got to be kidding me. Depot had singles in stock. Talked to a employee, called around and found me a store which had them in stock. Verified and had them hold it for me. 

I won't go into that Lowe's anymore. As others said thought - depends greatly upon the store."
