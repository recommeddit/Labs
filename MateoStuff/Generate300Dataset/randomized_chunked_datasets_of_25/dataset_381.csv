Kid Toasty always wanted to make video games. I think I'd go back for computer science/art double major. People say, ""If you love video games, don't get a job making them."" Adult Toasty isn't finding that same spark when playing video games but the idea of making imagination into reality is still there.",best major to study in college

Fever goes up, bring it down. Then let it go up again. And then bring it down. Just try not to let it get too high, and your cold leaves faster.

also, it only works if you have a fever",best medicine for a cold

The Model Y Standard Range isn't technically sold (though apparently you can get them if you call) and doesn't have a price.  All Model Y's have the long range battery.  The 60 kWh is only sold on the Model 3.

And yeah, I don't understand the quibbling here.  Indeed per numbers at ev-database the Tesla charging system sinks about 70% more power, or (because of somewhat higher efficiency) 86% higher rate of  recovered range.  The article seems spot on to me.  The ID.4 isn't really that impressive as a vehicle, but a crossover at $40k is pretty attractive for a lot of market segments.

That's not completely surprising for a vehicle that costs 30% more.",best electric car

Heck, I did a language *minor* and some of my classmates complained that it‚Äôs not printed on the degree so they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù put it on their resume for some prestige. I‚Äôve brought many to light that if your language skills are good enough you *can* put [Language - Proficiency], and that you don‚Äôt have to put it on if you can‚Äôt speak the language anymore.

It is a very high quality port of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, and works much better on touch than I would have imagined. The only IAPs it has is three expansion sets (Wacky Worlds, Time Twister, and Toolkit), which I'd call optional.   

It is kind of the polar opposite of most mobile games, no annoying ads, no conveyor belt of ""challenges"", limited & valuable IAPs, and deep gameplay.",best items under $100

Every time I have walked in there (over a dozen times) they don't have what I need. Infuriating. I went in there in the dead of winter to buy a zone control. I needed three zones but I could get by with one. They literally do not carry any in the store. Single zone included. You've got to be kidding me. Depot had singles in stock. Talked to a employee, called around and found me a store which had them in stock. Verified and had them hold it for me. 

I won't go into that Lowe's anymore. As others said thought - depends greatly upon the store.",best home improvement store
