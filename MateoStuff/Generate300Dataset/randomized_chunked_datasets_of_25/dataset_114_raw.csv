"Love these! You have great taste and tend to gravitate toward bold classical scents. Most men would be scared to wear such striking, traditionally feminine perfumes, so I’m guessing you’re a woman, probably past your twenties.

"> The Willpower Instinct
+1. That book has some of the best explanations (real, biological, evolutionary reasons) for why willpower and stress work the way they do, rather than just throwing around arbitrary methods of ""habit forming"" or books that are essentially motivational speaking/feel-good."
Trader Joes has the best and cheapest. You do have to add a bit of sugar.
