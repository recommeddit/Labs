The link is working on my end.
Berseria is much better. Zestira is the worst modern tales game IMO.
"Samsung Wireless Battery Bank, 10000mAh. Takes USB-C in, and has also a Qi charger on top of the battery pack. I use this also as my “nightstand charger” with the phone sitting on top of it, and another device charging via a cable"
Isn't that the absurd playlist with the Bulbasaur dinosaur thing in its thumbnail?
I second this man. I have games just collecting dust!
More importantly the case alone weighs about half your checked baggage allowance (here in Europe). This is completely impractical.
Fuck that. I always picked Carthage in AOE1 for the War Elephants. They just tusked through everything.
"Drew Barrymore is great. In 2009, I was in college and flying home from MIA to JFK for Thanksgiving. I saw her at the top of the escalator to my gate being swarmed by people asking for photos. For whatever reason, my dopey closeted 19-yr-old self decided that yelling “Drew! I love you so much!” was the appropriate thing to do. I swear to you, she locked eyes with me and used it as an excuse to get away from the crowd. We rode the escalator down together and she said something along the lines of “you’re so sweet, thanks for getting me out of that!” and we talked about our Thanksgiving plans. She ended up being on my flight back to NY. All in all our interaction lasted 30 seconds, but she was so kind and down to earth, I’ll never forget it. I work in the film industry now, and hope our paths cross one day so I can tell her how she completely made my day back then, aha."
"That's a shame. I can tell you that me and my friends have played through it twice, but the second time was new game plus which makes it different. 

I can also tell you that you still had a lot of game and story to get through! I'm sad that you may not ever complete it. The last few missions are Soo good story wise."
I guess imma predictable person
"Barry Bonds is probably my favorite song on the whole album, 2nd Everything I Am"
"I second this.  I had Verizon for years.  I rarely ever lost service, the only time it happened was when I was in certain buildings that cause problems for all networks.  I switched to TMobile and I hit dead spots pretty frequently.  Sometimes my service will randomly go out when Im chilling at home which is really odd and certainly never happened when I was on Verizon."
"Mechanical pencils are great for precise lines, and you can get them in a variety of widths (thinnest I ever saw was 0.1mm) But to get some hardcore drawing done, I'd want to find mechanical pencil lead with a variety of hardnesses as well. Don't know if that exists or if it's worth the trouble, but I'll just lurk a bit and see if anyone else knows. Anyway.

I've had these 0.3mm and 0.5mm, of these [Pentel](https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-0-3mm-Mechanical-Pencil-Barrel/dp/B000WH2WSO/ref=sr_1_12?crid=1VKRKPOJ73I3X&keywords=0.3mm+mechanical+pencil&qid=1581012129&sprefix=0.3mm+mechanical+pencil%2Caps%2C227&sr=8-12) drafting mechanical pencils for about ten years and they still work great. I don't even begin to take good care of them and have had no problems."
Look at Jackery. I can get two full charges for my iPhone 5. Pretty convenient.
">Kids that look to old get one piece and and criticized

I dunno. I kinda wished adults can go trick-or-treating. So I probably won't make fun of kids who are too old.

>If you run out of candy: Set an empty bowl out side in front of the door and close it. But keeps the lights on. Lights off will make you look like someone who wasn't giving out candy at all. (then hope. TP isn't bad eggs are)

Quite possibly the best advice in this thread (which has a ton of great advice). I will definitely do this. Thank you so much for coming out of lurking to help me out."
One of the all-time funniest things I've ever seen. And it never gets less funny. It's as funny now as when I first watched it years ago
English or psychology. It would’ve been so much easier for me
A raspberry pi.
I love her and karolina zebrowska
the best part is when it's finished you can blow the bag up to use as a pillow whilst you sleep on the street.
"Try *Amazonia* by James Rollins. Not the greatest literature ever, but it's quite entertaining and it has that ""Lost World"" feel to it."
Sublime Text. That is all.
Why does the Liverpool side stop at '83 as they kept on winning trophies throughout the 80s?  Turnover in the squad?

"I kinda disagree with putting fedora into Advanced section. It has it's issues, but I think it should be more for brave beginners like I once was myself :).   
I'd put it along with openSUSE Tumbleweed in a Comfortable category or maybe make an Intermediate category? They're good distros with sane defaults but require some stuff to be done like installing codecs and maybe troubleshoot some issues, so not building from scratch like Arch or Gentoo but as easy like Manjaro or Ubuntu.  
That said, great list! I hope it will be expanded in the future"
