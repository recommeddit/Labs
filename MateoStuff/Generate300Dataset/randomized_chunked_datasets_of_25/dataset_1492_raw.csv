"My mom was unhappily taking her first golf lesson in St Louis. She spent 1 or 2 miserables hours at the driving range with an instructor.

Irritated and swearing to never take golf lessons again, she met dad in the Golf store clubhouse after the lesson. 

Before they left her instructor came by and said, “exciting day, huh!”

My mom, said it was ok. 

The instructor replied, “are you kidding, Michael Jordan was in the tee box next to you for an hour, chatting up a storm.”

My mom replied, “that was Michael Jordan?”

My dad just stood there with his jaw on the floor."

"Hi, any idea on how the XPS graphic card Iris XE graphic holds up on ranking? 
What specs would you recommend to have?"

"I'm always a little hesitant, but something that caught my eye was a subscription service, every month you get sent a months worth and that month you could ask the ladies/opinions you value, what there thought is.

Here is a YouTube video that has tips on choosing new cologne. I know that I had heard about new subscription  service on cologne scents....but I can't find it.

"I always love putting vodka into the cherry limeade they make at Sonic. Plus then you can walk around public places getting sloshed, and everyone just thinks you are drinking a Sonic drink."
"My dad really likes to take walks, but he has really shitty shoes. I'm getting him a gift certificate JUST FOR SHOES. I'm making my mom enforce this rule. He has a really shitty pair that he mows the lawn in and his work boots. 

My 2 year old daughter is getting her daddy a new hat because even she thinks the inside of it is yucky."
