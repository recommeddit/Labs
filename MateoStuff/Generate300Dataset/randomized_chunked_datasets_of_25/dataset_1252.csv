68457,"I’ll be interested to see how your opinion of Book of the New Sun changes if you read further.  Which isn’t to say that I’m sure you’ll grow to love it—many people don’t, and it’s not personally my favorite of Wolfe’s writing—but it’s definitely as much a literary puzzle as it is a surface-level narrative, and it’s a puzzle you only have half the pieces to now.  

That said, I can definitely understand that feeling of appreciating more than enjoying it.",best science fiction novel

28237,"I do the exact same thing with bacon/eggs...sometime try chopping some vegetables and chucking those in. Finely chopped shallots, mushrooms and spinach is probably my favorite combo so far for this. While you're browning the vegetables for a minute or two in the bacon grease, get some toast going and prep your eggs. I like to take the crispy bacon from the oven and crush it into crumbles, then stir it right into my eggs...then dump that right into the bacon grease with the vegetables once you're satisfied with how far along those have gotten. Stir all of it on medium heat till you've got a great looking scramble, then dump some of the scramble on your toast, ideally with some good cheese. Boom, restaurant-grade breakfast sandwich. Seriously, try this once and you'll be doing it every Sunday morning afterward forever. It's also super easy to scale up or down if you've got more people to feed for whatever reason, 1-2 slices of bacon and 2-3 eggs per person.",best breakfast foods
67104,"I’m 16 jumps into my A at Elsinore and have also spent some time at Perris just hanging out but not jumping. I find that Elsinore is a more fun place to be and that fun jumpers there are friendlier. I also feel that I am getting solid instruction from my coaches. However as someone else mentioned, Perris certainly has the bigger reputation. The only time I’ve had to wait more than 30 minutes to get on a load was one extremely slow Monday where they stopped the plane for about 2 hours.",best places to skydive in california
