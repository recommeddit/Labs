53923,"Ummm I need to pick you or your sisters brain. I get this 3-4 times a year for like 2-3 weeks. I was told by the doctor I get post nasal drip and have a deviated septum.

1) I'm surprised to see this here because I thought most people only get a cold, and it usually only progresses to sinus infection due to poor drainage, is that correct?

2) Does an anti histamine almost always work for cold purposes? Because when I take claritin and such for allergies (allegra, all of them I've tried), they do almost nothing. 

3) For people like us, does it always reach stage 4 with a chest infection? I've been at stage 3 on and off for about 2 weeks. One day I'll barely be coughing, another night a cough keeps me up til 3am. 

4) Wouldn't an antihistamine stop stage 3 (taking delsym) since it stops music production? What is delsym, just cough medicine (cough suppressant?) Wouldn't both work?",best medicine for a cold

36995,"I’ve been on all the non-kiddie coasters except Apocalypse (though I haven’t done Revolution since pre-makeover, and the ones I have done were spread out over 3 visits from 2010 to 2017). Here’s my ranking...I think:

*Tier 1: Awesome*

T1. Twisted Colossus

T1. X2

3. Tatsu

4. Full Throttle

5. Superman

*Tier 2: Solid*

6. Batman

7. Goliath

8. Scream

*Tier 3: OK*

9. Ninja (would like to ride it again though)

10. Revolution (probably better post-refurb)

*Tier 4: Wouldn’t Recommend*

11. Riddler’s Revenge (probably would’ve rated it higher if I hadn’t been worried the whole ride as my seat kept popping up notches...)

12. Viper (ouch...would like to try again though)

13. Goldrusher (just odd, not comfortable as a single rider)

14. Green Lantern (lots of forward/backward body tossing...it’s like a mild car accident)",best roller coaster at six flags
