"Funny!  I really like almost everything on your list, a lot, and yet I really don't like ambroxan (e.g., rules out BR540 for me)."
"Dirt Rally is much more sim-esque than the other Dirt games. Depends what you like, but it's certainly more difficult and I found it harder than a lot of other sim style games too. I do like that they left the Gymkhana shit out of the game though, I'm sick of that crap."
Motion sensor night lights. Can’t tell you how many stubbed toes or falls they have prevented. Also a cheap intruder alarm.
"I honestly don't remember learning about it. Which is surprising because Texas produces a huge percentage of US textbooks. My state was experimenting with standardized testing, and so the history curriculum changed each year. Which resulted in me learning about 1492-1864 FIVE TIMES. We were taught reconstruction once, and never actually got to WWI or later. I only took world history once in college (we did an ancient egypt thing in 4th grade but I don't think that really counts).   
To answer your question, we spent a single day talking about ""remembering the Alamo"" and that was about all the context we got. No Spanish American war, no Mexican American war.   
But let me tell you, I can talk about the revolutionary war for hours. They drilled that into us at the expense of everything else.  
(And before you say anything I had a 3.85/4.0 A average when I graduated, 17th out of 300-something so I was actually paying attention in class)"

Thank you! Libre is new to me but I love it! It’s the perfect sweet musk
It will be a long time before someone mentions a Spiderman movie and my first thought isn't Tobey Maguire. I am happy with Tom Holland though.
"I actually mention Far in my presentation. I've used both, but am more familiar with MC. I've seen pluses to each that did not exist in the other, so I cannot claim one is better than the other.

Drag and drop: I think MC has it within itself (not from Window manager to it). I personally do not care for it either way as I find the benefit of Far/MC is the ability to do everything with the keyboard. 

Explorer context menu: Definitely good, but only relevant in Windows.

File editor/viewer/archive manager. Both have them.

Does Far let me SFTP to other sites and treat them like local drives? Also, I've not found a good way to bookmark directories in Far..."
Dolphin because it comes with plasma. Honorable mention :  Thunar; Thunar has the best GUI bulk rename utility I've ever seen
"I think Barca should be 4th at the most, behind Munich and Milan."
"These are in no particular order, I just found that when I started these I just binged them all as fast as I could

The Heroic Legend of Arslan
Attack on Titan
Vinland Saga
HunterxHunter
Demon Slayer
Babylon
Ajin
Re:Zero
My hero Academia
The Promised Neverland

If anyone has any recommendations for me based on these shows that'd be great, I'm open to anything!"
akudama drive?  IDK i feld that was a clone of suicide squad and not even better tbh to each there own
Explanation edited in; check my post again.
"1. Made in Abyss
2. Clannad: After Story
3. Vinland Saga
4. Violet Evergarden
5. A Place Further than the Universe
6. Gurren Lagann
7. Steins;Gate
8. Nichijou
9. Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei
10. Astra Lost in Space

All of them are first seasons apart from *Clannad: AS*, which has such a different vibe to the first season that it might as well be considered a different show - though you should certainly watch the first season first if you want to watch it, as while it's relatively generic (but fun on its own too), it's like the ""foundation"" to the story that helps After Story pop off.

1-5 are fairly set in stone, but 5-10 could all switch spots fairly easily, plus there are some shows I couldn't add there either but are close enough to top 10 that they could be there easily too, like Kaguya-sama or Code Geass."
"I was waiting for an order in a bakery about 10 years ago, Pauly Shore walked in, looked around in awe at the pies, then looked at me and said ""look at all these treeeeeats"".  My life was complete."
"Clannad/Clannad After Story, Starts as a harem, but turns into an emotional story about life

Black Lagoon, Kickass anime. Guns, swearing, and Revy. [Sweet Jesus Revy.](http://i.imgur.com/mmlUcRN.jpg)

The World God Only Knows, One of the best Harems around. Focuses mainly on comedy, but plot gets quite good

D-Frag!, Extremely funny comedy

K-On!, Adorable and happy moe anime

Last but not least,

Angel Beats, Its funny, heart wrenching, emotional. Seriously a beautiful anime. The OP describes it perfectly in my opinion."
If you have chimera I’d recommend you don’t install zebra. Last version of sileo broke compatibility and I almost lost my jailbreak if it wasn’t for unc0ver rootfs.
Hell no. For me that will either be Foundation or Dune.
"I'm happy to hear my post helped. 

Here's what I did for exercise (I work at a desk 8 hours a day.) 

Everytime I go to the bathroom, I do 2 pull ups and 5 air squats. It adds up fast. 

If you like reading, Tim Ferriss's 4 Hour Body really helped me."
