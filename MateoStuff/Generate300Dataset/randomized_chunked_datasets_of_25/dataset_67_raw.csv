The German movie?
I’m so bummed about that..
"Dark and Stormy:

"Smoothies. Get some frozen fruit and veggies, throw in with milk, make a big batch and use over the course of your week."
Any recommendations on the brand?
"It's up to you. I use it in my natural lit rooms. I just suggest using a matte based sheen. It's more modern looking, IMO."
The Witcher 3 should be on there as well IMO
Cold-EEZE.
"R6 and valorant are more control while OW is a faster shooter. IMO if you don't mind a little speed I'd try hayate otsu v2 or hien, soft or xsoft."
Zac Efron. When I met him I was a teenager and I hated him for no reason. Mostly jealousy. I was a total dick to him expecting him to also be a dick but actually he was the coolest dude ever. He was a total gentleman. He fucking called me sir and I was younger than him. He made me feel like a total asshole and I was. Ever since then I feel like I was moved by that. I try to think twice about how celebrities are. I didn't know how to be after our interaction. But ever since then Ive just been happy to hear about his success.
"Agree on best tasting. TMGS Twist is amazing too. Also, to add to your list, about twice the amount of caffeine as the average Monster too! I love Rockstars"

"I second this, the clues are so well hidden throughout the film that it all makes sense when the reveal finally comes but you still don't expect it."
"As long as windows cant scale properly, i disagree"
The Three Body Problem is one of the best sci-fis and novel that I’ve read in YEARS.
"I recommend Samsung S24D590L (or 390L, they are the same thing). The monitor looks great, it's IPS.. for the money, can't complain."
Shouldn't we be looking for accuracy rather than conformity to a particular perspective?
Why aren't you allowed to drink orange juice?

"I had good experiences with the Anker brand cables. After two phones they are slowly losing good contact. In the meantime they have been regularly rolled over with an office chair, been manhandled by a toddler and been in many suitcases and backpacks. 

Also they are bright red and the only charging cables that I never had to search for long."
"Wall Street Journal. Like the others have said, pretty unbiased compared to thr New York Times or Washington Post. Plus if you can get the student discount like I did, you can get it for $4 a month."
"Tap water, here in Finland its drinkable and tastes good."
"It would be nice if universities that were 0-100, 100-200, 200-300... etc were marked with different colors"
Using the Anker Powerlines. They’re quality cables and last a while. The ones in this review are the new models. The Powerline 2’s can be had for like $12-$15.
