31856,"I’ve stayed at Royal Pacific, Hard Rock, and Surf Side so I can’t speak for the whole spectrum. I can say Surfside was a beautiful hotel for a value. Bus service was easy and frequent. Really enjoyed my stay there.

I personally prefer the HR or RP for the short walk to City Walk and faster security (usually a walk-up). Both hotels have beautiful scenery and theming as well as great restaurants. At that point it becomes a matter of preference if you prefer a pacific tropical theme or artsy music vibes. RP is usually a little cheaper if that matters.",best hotel to live in

28588,"Where I live, a good hearty breakfast consists of white rice, miso soup, a peculiarly sweet egg concoction (it's not an omelette, I don't give a shit what the natives say), some pickled vegetables, and a slab of salt-grilled mackerel. If god loves you (let's be fair if god loved you you wouldn't be awake in time for breakfast) you get a big piece of fish, or two pieces of fish. Three pieces of fish.

Or at least, this is the basic menu at a hotel or something. I think most people only eat breakfast if their wife or mother makes it for them.

So yeah, cup of coffee and a cigarette probably.

EDIT: Yes, as many of the comments have noted, this is Japan.",best breakfast foods

13501,"I've found Sci-hub less effective these days, but yeah they're still around. Also consider using [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) for searching OA content. Industry people think much of what used to be paywalled will be open access as a standard.
