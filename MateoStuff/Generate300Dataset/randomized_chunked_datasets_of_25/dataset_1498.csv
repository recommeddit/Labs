54227,best medicine for a cold,Will have to look into that have tried pretty well every drug possible.
24364,best anime,"Haruhi at number 10! I feel kinda vindicated after years of people trying to convince me it wasn't that great anymore.

Also Utena at 3 is really cool, wouldn't have expected that at all (though I was certain it would be on this list)."
30520,best Mexican war to study,"He said much more; you’re only using one line to support an argument.  

Grant said the following .... “I’m opposed to the war as it would bring in new slave supporting territories; in opposing the measure felt the war was unjustifiable” 

However he also went on to write that subsequent Union victory in the civil war admonished the Mexican secession.  

Grant would go on to lead the industrialization of those lands he felt were so wrongly acquired..... lining his coffers. 

One fact remains he benefited from two North American Wars; without those wars .... he’s a drunk and a debtor."
2964,best webcamera,"In the university I work at we use Zoom and people really don't care as as long as they can be seen and heard.

34005,best Pokemon game,I agree but I feel it's much better because it doesn't have HMS( I know s and m also didn't have) and we had a pc that's anytime accessible and Pokemon camp is my dream come true and overworld Pokemon are also good and I don't care about dexcut because I only play with Pokemon in that region and the music is damn good and I like the artstyle

22528,best celebrity,Val Kilmer.  He seems like a dude you would like to have as a neighbor.
36128,best alcoholic drink,"I was really hoping I'd see this here. I LOVE picklebacks, but no one has any idea what the fuck I'm talking about when I try to get it at a bar, and they stare at me like I'm insane.
