26777,best board games,"Not terribly, but it's harder than most, at least at first. Most people just get lost in the explanation, but after playing one round people will understand it, if they last. I put it up there because you have to like long gameplay and you have to be able to be fine with a lot of initial rules. I've a taught a [very intelligent] 11 year old, but I've had grown men say it's too much."
