When he passed away he left me a steamer trunk full of them, still in the boxes. I have the trunk in my attic and still add to it on christmas and his birthday. One day I'll pass them down to my kids if I have any."

68344,best science fiction novel,"I'm about 100 pages in, and it feels like it's slowly creeping its way out of the scene-setting phase. So far I'm enjoying it a lot more than anything else of Stephenson's that I've read."
66385,best soccer team in the world,It's nothing in a erotic way. Just a casual picture of her and some other students enyoing a sauna or something like that. Nothing terrible but also nothing worth searching on bing. But enough to confirm that the mammoth cock rumours are false.

65888,best college in california,"The experience of one CSU to another can be wildly different, like Dominguez Hills and San Diego State. I graduated from a CSU, and some of my classmates did get jobs on the east coast - the key difference is they had internships locally with the Big 4. Everyone seems to respect a CSU degree here, especially when it's from a local CSU. UC is the same way.... UCLA is a lot more impressive than UC Riverside or UC Merced.  My sister went to USC, seemed to open up a lot of doors for her because of all the connections she made there."
