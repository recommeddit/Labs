Soulless appliances.
It appeals more to families and it's located near Disneyland.

"Here's what u/HammeredHeretic is taking about:

""Heifer International is working to eradicate poverty by shipping animals, along with agricultural and values-based training, to families in need around the world as a means of providing self-sufficiency. Recipients must agree to “pass on the gift” by sharing animal offspring, as well as the skills and knowledge gained with other impoverished families.""

They send you pictures of happy families lovingly holding their brand new chickens. You never knew you wanted that until now."
I think that it is a pretty good value if you do not want to upgrade components yourself.
"I did the same thing! My mom always yelled at me for it so for her birthday or some holiday I can't remember now I spent all night spotlessly cleaning it, vacuumed, everything. When she came home I told her her gift was in my room. She almost fainted haha"
"If you like history involving wars, San Jacinto monument around Houston, besides the Alamo in San Antonio might be interesting places to visit. Also smaller towns like Goliad and Gonzales, but Houston and San Antonio have a lot of other interesting things to do than gawk at old cannons.

If you like nature, Big Bend is pretty. The Davis Mountains I can personally attest to being nice, but my idea of pretty is probably twisted from living in Texas and never having left the state. There's bats along the river in Austin that give the local community college their team name.

Kolaches, brisket, and beer are what make Texas, food-wise. Also Tex-Mex, I suppose. See Slovacek's around Waco, Lockhart Smokehouse in Dallas (apparently based on Kreuz's in Lockhart, small town south of Austin. I'm just gonna assume they're as good as Kreuz's) for the first two. I'm underage, so I can't speak for booze, but we've got Tito's vodka, Shiner, and Ziegenbock beer in Texas, those all seem pretty popular.

You could always try the San Antonio Rodeo. Probably a decent one up in Fort Worth as well, I imagine, that's by Dallas. A good time to sample Texan cuisine as well. Get an idea of rural Texas culture without leaving a city, kind of thing. Since that's when ranchers come in town to show off their stuff."
"Yeah, and buy a BIG one. I carry a 20000mAh when I travel - that thing can keep me going for days."
It's almost the season! Hopefully you can hold out a little longer.
"I'm happy Selena was a sweetheart, she comes across as one!"
"I am going to ditch my PureTalkUSA service as my data stopped working and customer support could not figure out why as in their system i am subscribed. If i use my wife's sim  which is under same family plan data works just fine on my phone, so definitely they have screwed up my account and literally provide no fix instead just giving me run around by forwarding me to a phone number which no one ever picks up. Looking at Consumer Cellular and Cricket now as a possible move."
I politely disagree.
"Not bad advice, also not great companies to work for."
Menard's!
"The fact that people are downvoting every single comment that mentions a politician they disagree with is ridiculous.

Edit: And my shockingly un-American comment too, apparently."
"I'm sure it's not your first time drinking, but incase you don't know this I will say this:

#If your asshole friend tries to give you a four horseman when you're already drunk, don't drink it, otherwise you're in for a terrible time."
"Have you heard of /r/thexeffect yet? Exactly what you're talking about, other than it only taking three weeks, but you can extend this technique for as long as you want.  

As far as my own personal goals go, I would like to get back into reading daily like I used to growing up (until about 14 or 15 years old when I started smoking weed, and had lots of online distractions to waste my time - Facebook, Reddit, Instagram etc). 

I'd like to start reading every night for at least half an hour before bed. I think this will in turn, allow me to get better sleep by actually being tired when I go to sleep. Ill be in bed less, but better rested when I wake up. 

I'm going to start marking it down every single day on my calendar when I achieve this, and monitor how much time I spend reading, to hopefully increase my time to an hour of daily reading. 

Thanks for posting and asking for us to post our own goals.. definitely helps me stay honest with myself when I have to think about it and write it down, rather than just think about it and move on to the next Reddit post."
Yes that's my goto flavor of reasonably common ice cream. Used to be my favorite but now Cinnamon Dulce de Leche and Salted Caramel have edged it out. But Butter Pecan on warm apple cobbler is crazy good.

If you can fake it you'll do just as well."

The pipe organ. With the right person playing it any type of music I'd possible. The organist at my church once played pink Floyd.
