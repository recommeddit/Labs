43512,"I thought that I liked memory foam and other fancy pillows, but the real life changer for me was a buckwheat pillow. I have sleep apnea, and it allows me to get my head into the perfect position and *keep* it there comfortably.

EDIT:

Before you go out and buy one, please research the pro's and cons. They aren't for everyone.

Consider them if you like a firmer pillow, occasionally wake up with an achey neck from lack of support, and want a pillow that breathes well. Someone in the comments has also pointed out that you will win every pillow fight you get into.

Downsides are: if you shift around in your sleep a lot, you'll need to adjust the pillow to fit your new position. Adjusting the pillow and settling in makes a little bit of noise as the buckwheat husks rub against each other, kind of like dry leaves crinkling. Some people are also allergic to buckwheat, but there are other similar fillings such as millet husks. Organic fillings also need to be replaced once in a while, since it breaks down over time.",best items under $100

37256,"I measured these by topic, not by search term. Usually when one searches a search term, the related topic pops up. The reason I selected topic is because there exists many alternative search terms for theme parks.

Now that you brought it up though, I went back to double check. BGW actually has a slight edge over KD (measuring topics). However, this was unlike previously, as previously I was comparing 5 theme parks at a time. One of the parks I think was Dollywood, and a part of the eastern Virginia area preferred that park, maybe that's why KD was measured as the most popular - because when comparing just BGW and KD, BGW is more popular in those areas preferring Dollywood, perhaps giving BGW the slight edge. It's very close tho, it's the most polarizing measurement out of all the states I've measured.",best amusement park
