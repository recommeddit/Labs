"Paprika , pretty sure Nolan drew some inspiration from the film , the elevator scene , the street mirror scene and the hallway scene ."
"Stan Lee shouldn’t have been attending comic conventions in 2017-2018. After his wife passed away, he was never the same. His sense of energy and spirit were gone and his health was clearly in decline. 

I met him about a dozen times between 2012-2016 and he was a delight to speak with every time! He had that same fun and friendly “larger than life” personality in person that I saw on TV and in the movies."
Excession is one of my favourites!
"I never noticed the scene was so flawless in that regard. Editing magic may have been worked, but it does look seamless AF."

"Pick an all inclusive, make sure it is a brand name.  Hilton in Jamaica was awesome.  I like the Marriott in St. Thomas too.  Costa Rica was nice, but didn't like beach - black sand.  In Mexico, just outside some resorts is dangerous...most actually.  All are fine if you don't leave."
No problem and good luck with your plans.
"NO oh god no, mine needed like a quart a month.......ahh the ol'e leaky 13b's......memories.....  /cry"

"Met Adam Devine of workaholics. He was obviously hungover but still took the time to be a nice guy. Real tight butthole. 

Snoop dogg was also a really laid back dude, but what do you expect."
"Ecco have a huge range of choice so there should be something for everyone.

Also decent insoles can make a world of difference too."
"I would have a Masters at 22, had I not decided to take a year out.

This is the norm in the UK."
This comment was such a roller coaster I am seriously considering buying one.
Is there any rides that are currently closed that I’m really missing out on or are the best open right now?
"YES, absolutely! When they unveiled the 12 Mini I was blown away and immediately pre-ordered it. It is the perfect iPhone for me and I am so happy with it.

But I don‘t upgrade to the 13 Mini because I think the differences are minor."
I’ve always wondered if this actually worked. Good to know.
"The new pwnage mouse should be coming out soon, it’s wireless and weighs ~65 grams, you could get it on Kickstarter for 75$"
