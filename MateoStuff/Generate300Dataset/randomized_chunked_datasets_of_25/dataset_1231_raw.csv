"I just found some of my 400 level algebra and analysis notebooks and flipped through them.  I can't believe that I could ever understand that stuff, let alone successfully complete 20-something credits in the pure math emphasis.  The coder that sits next to me at work couldn't even grasp that .9 repeating = 1."
"OMG, you missed an actual legit useful data-science (tending more towards data-engineer) humble-bundle package.  Here's what it included for like $25!:

  * Data Science at the Command Line (Joren Janssens)
  * Cassandra: The Definitive Guide (Jeff Carpenter et al)
  * Doing Data Science (Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt)
  * Graph Databases (Ian Robinson et al)
  * Learning Spark (Holden Karau...)
  * Head First Data Analysis (Michael Milton)
  * High Performance Spark (Holden Karau and Rachel Schutt)
  * Hadoop: The Definitive Guide (Tom White)
  * Practical Machine Learning with H20 (Darren Cook)
  * Practical Machine Learning: A New Look at Anomaly Detection (Ted Dunning & Ellen Friedman)
  * Practical Machine Learning: Innovations in Recommendation (Dunning, Friedman)
  * Think Bayes (Allen B. Downey)
  * Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python (Matthew Kirk)
  * Time Series Databases (Dunning, Friedman)

Dunno which is the most useful yet.  Right now I'm tooling up to support data scientists on the back-end, so I'm focusing on the kind-of-boring aspects like Spark, Hadoop and Cassandra.  Which aren't really boring if you like playing with Legos.  Or, if you have some other projects in mind that will use all those pieces parts to do something interesting!  ;-)

Edit:  I also highly recommend the podcast ""Linear Digressions."""

"Oh man.  The best story of any genre I have ever read is The Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson.  He was an archaeologist/anthropologist for a long time before becoming a writer and it really shows.  His story is extremely complex, realistic (as far as fantasy can be realistic) and surprising.  He pretty much drops you in to the middle of a story with many different arcs and leaves you standing there confused for a while.  Clarification comes, but he never wraps everything up in a neat little package for you.  I've never been so emotionally invested in fiction.  I not only cried, but actually wept at points.  I'm not exactly the picture of stoicism...but still.  The first book is really good, but honestly kind of hard to follow for the first half, but once the three or so story lines start coming together, you will be hooked.  The second book is fucking brilliant and they just get better from there.  

That said, it's not for everybody.  If you have a need to skim or think about other things while you read, it's probably not for you. He will definitely leave you wondering what the hell is going on a LOT.  The reveals will come pages, chapters and books later...sometimes not at all.  

Also, I don't know how old you are now, and he writes on somewhat academic level.  If you aren't comfortable with a sometimes obscure and usually high-level vocabulary, you may not enjoy it.

Edit:  Forgot to mention that tor.com is doing a chapter by chapter re-read of the entire series with someone who has read the whole thing and someone who hasn't read it at all.  They are giving really fun commentary on every scene and they even have a Q&A with the author after each book is finished. it's sweet!!  http://www.tor.com/features/series/malazan-reread-of-the-fallen"

It's a cocktail from Disney, but everywhere I go has made it for me when I've asked.
Pina colava with raspberry puree in. It's gorgeous."
"\> Why is it so fucking hard for EA to take NFS U2 and just make a revamp with the same mechanics, same upgrade choices, same customization etc, make modern graphics and charge a set price, and not have it packed with MTXs?

&#x200B;

Not worth the money investment, duh. Besides, i doubt anyone at EA still has original engine of the game and i have my doubts it will do nicely with modern graphics with just an asset swap."

"> I remember in NFS: Underground 2 if you progressed to quickly you soon found out you were racing against too fast cars compared to yours. Then you grind a few races, get that big turbo and go back and be competitive. It felt good, thats how it should be.

The problem is that the inverse wasn't true. You could be rolling in a max upgraded car, and some AI in a stock Civic will be always 2 seconds behind you. The rubber-banding in that game was atrocious. You'd see that Civic crash then a few seconds later, it would be going 450 mph in full ""swiggity-swooty, your racing line is now my property"" mode."
"I lose/break/sit on/scratch sunglasses a ton, so I only buy cheap ones, pretty much. I have a pair of [Quays](https://www.quayaustralia.com/collections/women/products/kosha?variant=36390222542) that I got as a gift (silver/clear) and I love the way they look but I feel like the lenses are kind of pale and don't actually protect me from squinting in full sun.
 

I have a few from Sunglass Spot, almost all of theirs are $5 and they have really trendy styles. I think it's kind of a toss-up quality wise, but for the most part they feel about as nice as Forever 21 or other fast fashion options. [This](https://sunglassspot.com/collections/round/products/steampunk-inspired-full-metal-retro-round-colorful-lens-sunglasses) is my favorite of the pairs I got from there, they have sort of a fun goggles vibe. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPikKM6D0Ge/?taken-by=breathcue) is me at the local women's march in another pair from Sunglass Spot.


Otherwise I'll hit up H&M or Forever 21 since I know they'll always have a selection of trendy styles."
"I would have to say a 24oz Stanley framing hammer, and a measuring tape. Allowed me to get a job in construction after I graduated university and I was broke, up to my ears in debt, and no job prospects. That job allowed me save up enough to buy a cheap car, and eventually enough to go back to school to get more education which allowed me to get a nice 'white collar' job which I now love. I still have the hammer and I have used it many times since."
