17514,best iOS game,"You can complete everything in the game F2P. There are loads of people that have done 0 wish accounts and have been able to complete the hardest content in the game.

The only thing you really need to pay for is characters you want, but even then if u save and plan accordingly you can get the character you want. Though it is impossible to get every character unless u whale.

I think the game is plenty fun, they often have lots of events to get 4 star characters either for free or by the events giving a lot of primogems (the currency used to wish on banners)

Give it a go, its free after all."

72373,best keyboard switches,"Of course that would be the best choice for thoroughness.  However, we have a whole wiki that people don't turn to because it's messy and complicated.  We're talking about beginners here--people who have never typed on a mechanical keyboard before and want a decent idea of which one or two switches would best suit them.  I think there's nothing better for that than a flowchart."

58767,best cologne,"Awesome post.  One thing to note:  if worn correctly as you suggest, a cologne will not smell the same on another man as it does on you.  If you do not apply too much of it, it will mix with your natural scent as well as the smell of your deodorant.  Your deodorant should complement your cologne, not clash with it.

I have found in the past that having a few female friends smell the cologne you are wearing and offer their opinion helps, since you cannot always smell exactly how it's going to smell on you, since you cannot smell your own natural scent."
