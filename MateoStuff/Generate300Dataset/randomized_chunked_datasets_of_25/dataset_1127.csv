54977,best water filter,I tested this the other day with my standard fish tank ph test kit. I filter the water through the brita for my small fish tank the water that comes out of my tap is quite basic and disgusting.. Interestingly after I tested the filtered water it was yellowish indicating the water was then slightly acidic after filtration. It definitely does something...
