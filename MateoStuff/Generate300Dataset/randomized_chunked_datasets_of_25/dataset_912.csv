Edit: I'm really tired.  Did you mean that you disagree with those titles on the list?  I think that's a valid complaint if that's the case.  Flower was a simple game but a good one, and it helped keep the company afloat that would later make Journey.  Someone else also had a problem with B:TS, and if I continue to get negative feedback towards its addition I'll remove it.  The narrative and actor cameo really made me want to put it on the list.  But there are likely games that do it better.",best game console
