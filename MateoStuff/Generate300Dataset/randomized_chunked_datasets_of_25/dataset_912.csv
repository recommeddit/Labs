6938,best iPhone,"You’ve pretty much got it right. 

My fav iPhone though is definitely the iPhone 6."
12778,best gifts for mom,"I love the term Take Away. When you're used to ""carryout"" it sounds so classy."
56041,best action and adventure movie,I really love Romancing the Stone.  That was a great adventure movie.
29943,best money managing app,"Not entirely a budgeting app, but my bank lets you automatically save things into budgeting, and as you spend you spend from those budgets. Basically the envelope system but using your money. 

I.e, you automatically save $100 a month for gas. You spend $50 at the gas station and it deducts from that $100."
16438,best sunglasses for fashion,"I'm upset at myself for feeling the fit with shutter shades was the most outlandish of all of these.

Honestly, I couldn't pull any of these off, I don't have the confidence, but they're all hilarious and excellent."

37654,best Marvel movie,Now we just need to see it repeated a hundred times...
29603,best game console,"I do have flower on the list, Beyond two souls is also on the list if that's what B:TS means :P

Edit: I'm really tired.  Did you mean that you disagree with those titles on the list?  I think that's a valid complaint if that's the case.  Flower was a simple game but a good one, and it helped keep the company afloat that would later make Journey.  Someone else also had a problem with B:TS, and if I continue to get negative feedback towards its addition I'll remove it.  The narrative and actor cameo really made me want to put it on the list.  But there are likely games that do it better."
3261,best webcamera,Nope this is exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for!
1895,best pizza place in Santa Barbara,Lilsy Wood Fired Pizza on De La Vina is pretty good. Good Axxess deal too.
69705,best major to study in college,"Yup! Has to be job specific now.  Just a degree doesn't get you anywhere... maybe 30 years ago it would've. If I had to do it over, I would spend 4 years at a junior college taking everything they offered until I was sure what industry or field truly interested me."
9284,best toothpaste,Sensodyne. I have sensitive teeth and it’s the only thing that helps (that I’ve tried)
27135,best board games,"Can someone explain to me why Legendary is so high? Do the expansions vastly improve the game. I only have the base set, and it's alright, but feels a little dull."
47769,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,No calculator needed
56792,best desktop monitor,"The LG UM57 25UM57 Ultrawide monitor goes for $180 on Amazon. Although it's above your budget slightly, it's a great monitor."
67954,best science fiction novel,"yea, I didn't trust the other list without the Foundation trilogy."
15042,best romantic novel,"Carian Cole for dark contemporary romance . 

JT Geissinger’s “bad habit” series is probably my favorite of all time

Also LOVE elisabeth naughton"
13409,best spreadsheet editor,"You also could use libreoffice or openoffice. Especially for xlsx files for example. Othetwise if its  a csv file, use R, python and if you like an editor."
60501,Best comedy show on Netflix,"Ah that explains it, what a bummer! I do hope netflix picks it up, it definitely had potential."
41963,movies like Inception,"*Contact* is from Carl Sagan-he and Ann Druyan wrote it up a film treatment, but when it stalled up they made it a novel. It's a bummer that Sagan never got to see the film."
