Ooh that might be good. I might get that when it comes out. It also gives me an excuse to replace my current Mini with a 500 Abarth :P
"You're either going to have to increase your price or expect it to die.  As others have said don't get the auto defrost and if you can commercial (true makes some nice ones) will last a lot longer.  You can also pull one from a house made in the 60s if you want...it'll be inefficient but last for a long time. 


 For what it's worth I spent 4k on a commercial kelvinator last month...has a beast of a motor and the seals are replaceable (whole thing is self serviceable and under warranty for 5 years).   Thing will probably outlast my house.


Bought an 800$ whirlpool a week later as well... still serviceable but not nearly as much as the kelvinator...i don't expect it to last nearly as long kind of wishing I'd have just spent more and got another all out nice one."
Looking forward to all these news games. Thanks forth the list!
That's nice
I'm looking for an high refresh rate ultrawide monitor. I have a GTX 1080 TI. Not too concerned about 1080p vs 1440p. Id prefer g-sync. I have budget of ‚Ç¨500ish can push a little more if a good deal/monitor is available. Does anyone know of anything?
"We could argue that the greater percussive and timbral capabilities of the guitar offer a similarly wide range. Classical music theory doesn't tend to consider percussion at all and timbre barely which is why piano wins in that context. Through a wider lens I can see them being equal, if for different reasons. It doesn't have to be all about voice leading."

Essentia a close second, slightly too high ph"
"I'm not sure, but how could you not want one after seeing this picture? http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/197486_10150112664699983_3585644_n.jpg"
"I can't say for sure 100% of the time, but in my experience, yeah :)"
Wait a little for the MM731?
