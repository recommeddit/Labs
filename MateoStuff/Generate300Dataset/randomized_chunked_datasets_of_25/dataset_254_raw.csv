They forgot to include Ray Lewis‚Äô  DPOY from 2000.  All it takes is to take a quick look at the Wiki page come on man.

"One thing people forget is that the only way you can get the H1N1 flu (or any other upper respiratory illness) from your hands, is if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose with those dirty paws.

Try and limit touching those areas, especially when you aren't sure if your hands are clean.  (ie after shaking hands, etc.)

You can walk around all day with your hands covered in H1N1 and won't get it, as long as you don't touch those areas.  Which is very hard to do in fact.  You touch your eyes, mouth and nose much more than you probably realize."
"Oof hard question! Right now it's very close, but I give the slightest edge to xm1r cause that's my all time favorite shape! I'm a relaxed claw kind of guy üëç. The gpx is so insane though!"

I'd quit school sooner and enlist and do what I'm doing now. degrees aren't for everyone.
"I'm 26 and definitely went through a ""my mom is lame and i don't want to talk to her"" phase. now that i'm older i can't believe what a great mom she was/is. we talk all the time.  don't worry, they'll grow out of it."
"ZeroWater is the best. The filters last forever, I probably only change it once a year and I use it for everything every day. Yes, I use the tester. Currently having issues with contaminates in city water so my tap isn't really safe to drink. ZeroWater is the only one that filters nitrates besides a reverse osmosis system."
Is charcoal toothpaste good for teeth or is it bad in the long run?
"Is it really? Jetbrains stuff does *a lot*. I don't use vs code, but virtually every day I use phpstorm I seem to find a new feature that's useful.

Refactors, integration with servers, integrations with DBs, running static analysis tools on the fly, nice navigation (click into a function etc.). 

It's hard to imagine a free thing doing as much as jetbrains seems to do. 

Can anyone comment, are they actually comparable?"
the reason sfa transitions so harshly is that everything in front of wild one was built over decades while the area behind it was planned and built in a few years. Until 1999 Wild One was effectively the very back of the park
"Yes, like I said Sandpiper Bay is the only all inclusive in the US. if you are looking mainly at all-inclusive resorts in the hopes of saving some cash then I might recommend a vacation home. With a full kitchen you can save considerable on meals over what you would spend at a hotel. 

Other than that, as I said there aren‚Äôt any true all-inclusive resorts in the US that are beachfront."
Ha ha nice! Good luck this year. I hope you have a great Halloween.

"What about:

\-Fedora

\-Zorin OS

I highly recommend Fedora, It uses the Gnome DE and it is very reliable and easy to install and use and it has a great community, and for Zorin OS it's very suited for those who are coming from windows or mac its DE is very clean in my op and user friendly, You won't go wrong with choosing any of them."

"For a year everyone I know got a Victorinox Swiss Army knife as a present for whatever celebration I would be obligated to give a gift. For Fathers Day I gave one to my dad. They all still carry it, including my father.

edit: clarity."
I had a German roomie who would heat up wheat beer throughout his cold.
