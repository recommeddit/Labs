72645,"I’m not sure about palm clawing, it’s so low-profile it’s really better for an out and out claw grip esp at 20x10, but the hump is towards the rear and can support the base of your palm a bit if that’s how you hybrid. 

I had a similar experience with the Model-O though, it felt so big that I should palm it but it wasn’t nearly as comfortable as the Air58 in that respect so I ended up in a hybrid but I didn’t love it. The Model-D is much more comfortable for a palm grip.

On the XM1 I’d say the sides are thin because of its low-profile but I have mine just in front of and just behind the midpoint of the mouse on the right hand side, respectively.

Sorry I can’t be more help, I know making the call can be tough. I’d say of the options as far as I’m familiar, Model-D for palm, XM1 for claw. I think the XM1 is the better mouse but I’d feel bad if I recommended something that wound up being too small for your grip preference.",best wireless lightweight mouse

27116,"To present the opposite viewpoint, my group found that it took way too long for what it was - a solid introductory engine builder. There's a few things it does well, drafting and making you pay to keep cards makes the decisions more tense right away for what you hold onto and the directions you build your engine and the shared map creates some tension, but for the time it took for us to play, we can get in a few games of Century or Gizmos or other games that satisfy the same engine-building itch.

I've heard that drafting corporations makes the game better, but it seems to me that it will just add to the play time without enough to make up for the increased length.",best board games

45409,"Own a pc, switch and ps4. Exclusives are on their respective systems obviously. Platformers and games that are better handheld or better played in short bursts are on switch. Rest goes on to pc.

Maybe I'd have preferred ps4 more if I had a giant tv with a couch setup or something and my pc wasn't hooked up to it. But all my devices are connected to the same 27 inch monitor so, pc and console experience is more or less the same to me. Therefore, playing/owning the games on a platform that allows higher fidelity is a no-brainer.",best gaming system
