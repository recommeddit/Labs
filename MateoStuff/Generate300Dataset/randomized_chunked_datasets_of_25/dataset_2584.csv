41990,movies like Inception,"Ummm sort of? Enders Game started as a short story, which the author later expanded into a novel, partially because he wanted to do things with Ender's family that he didn't in the short story, partially to set up and expand on the speaker for the dead concept, and partly because he does that sometimes.  Ender himself is of minimal importance in the sequels. The story requires a human speaker for the dead, which doesn't need to be Ender, but instead could have been anyone to took up that pseudo-faith following the end of Enders Game."

**Warning:** this can be quite painful while you have the mouthwash in but go for the whole 30 seconds anyways. Once you spit it out the pain will be gone. 

**Pro-tip:** In a pinch, vodka works almost as well as mouthwash."

73198,best Linux distro,"The biggest change from the Windows world will be the different interfaces to choose from. While they're one of the best features of Linux, the number of choices and strong opinions on the matter can be overwhelming to new users. And everyone in the community is certain that theirs is the best. Don't stress out about picking the ""right"" one. You can always change it later (especially if you choose something Ubuntu based). Pick one that has a large user base, good community, and excellent documentation. 

Linux comes in many different flavors, or ""Distributions"". Often shortened to ""Distros"". The most obvious difference between Distros is the interface (or ""Desktop Environment"" or ""DE""). It's not the only thing that sets them apart, but it's the most noticeable. 

I would recommend Ubuntu or any one of it's variants. The best variants (in my opinion) are Linux mint and Linux Lite. Linux Lite having the most ""Windows like"" interface. Linux Lite also has additional tools to install common programs that Windows users are accustomed to. Ones that don't come with other Distros by default. 

Until recently Ubuntu used an interface called ""Unity"". As of the last couple of releases, they have switched to Gnome. However, they've made gnome look a lot like Unity, so you should be able to follow instructions you find on the internet without too much trouble. 

Gnome has a ton of customizations available via the ""Gnome extensions"" website. If you're willing to relearn how to interact with your computer's interface, it's a good fit for someone who wants customization.

Basic understanding of EV ranges, basically the size of a battery needed to achieve the range given the efficiency of a Truck that size. Batteries are in very short supply. They cannot be putting in a 200kwH+ battery into this Truck to get 400+ range. 

A Tesla Model Y is consumption is ~3.35 mi/kwh at freeway speeds; with it's 75kWh  battery size, you can roughly expect 250 miles range on the freeway. The consumption is based on the size, weight and aerodynamics of a car. 

The F150 is expected to be at ~1.61 mi/kwh at freeway speeds (bigger, heavier and not aerodynamic). To get 400 range, you would need a battery the ~250kWh. With the battery being a constrained resource and the biggest cost of an EV (usually half the price of a car), that is basically like making 3-4 Tesla Model Ys.  The hummer ev has a battery @ 200kWh, and with a price tag to match $112K.

Estimates for F150 battery size are: 

~115kWh for standard, and ~155kWh for extended range.

Let's give F150 a best case scenario for efficiency with 2 miles/kwh --- @ 155kWh battery size that's ~300 miles range. Want AC, less range; Drive in cold weather <40 Degrees, less range. But, for a more expected value, 250 miles @ freeway speeds is expected. 

So, unless Ford has managed to make an EV battery cheaper than anyone else, and managed to source an unlimited supply. Don't expect 400+ range. 


**There are multiple reports from independent people that the range is in the 350-450 range without a load.**

No there are not. Some Youtuber's managed to navigate to the range guestimator while doing walkthroughs on a prototype vehicle and noted what they saw for a Truck that was dropped off to them. No one drove it. Zero relevance to actual ranges for a Production vehicle. ""Accurate"" range calcs are likely not developed for F150 yet. Truck is still ~6-12 months out. They likely won't submit to EPA until next year when they actually develop a production vehicle. They note on their site these won't be available until 2022. 

**The size of vehicle isn't going to impact highway range that much.**

Umm, for an EV that's pretty much the most important factor. Basic physics -- the bigger the size the more drag the faster you go which reduces range. For reference, the Tesla Model Y is 8% less efficient than the Model 3 due to the size and that's with two very aerodynamic cars.  

https://www.audi.com/en/experience-audi/mobility-and-trends/e-mobility/e-tron-aerodynamic.html

""Our job becomes more challenging. Because good aerodynamics and low air resistance are even more important for electric cars. Essentially, you have significantly less energy available overall than you do with vehicles powered by a combustion engine. So we need to optimize efficiency in every area. And one area in particular is air resistance in constant driving conditions at constant speed, such as on freeways.""

Everything is done to improve the range of an EV (including the type of hubcap), because of how much aerodynamics affect EV range. 

Again if you're thinking you'll see 350-450 range from this Truck, you'll be disappointed. Ford can be sandbagging but not by 50%."

Warm Buddy microwave teddy bear $45 - I have PTSD and it helps me fall asleep. Because the warming beanbag is in a stuffy it doesn't overheat/burn you.
