27117,"I haven't played with the drafting corporations variant, but I mostly agree with your critique, although I think it's still one of of the best games I own.  It's just not suited for everyone.  Personally, I love and hate Terraforming Mars, here are my thoughts:

Good:

1. Very high replayability.  The combination of different corporations you play, combined with each card being unique, makes the game play different every time.
2. Strong engine building in terms of everything you need to consider, with rarely a clear decision to be made, often a lot of alternatives to consider.  Hyper focused on efficient play.
3. Focus on tactics and adapting to your hand, which can level the playing field between average and novice player.
4. The ""gamble"" of drafting cards in this game is very alluring.  Since each card is unique, it doesn't work like other games where you're hoping to draw a specific card, since the odds of that are so slim.  Each round almost plays out like opening a present and then doing your best with what you're given.

Bad:

1. Terrible components.  It's almost laughable how much they cheaped out here.  A more consistent art style, better components, and better packaging would have done wonders for this game.  Hoping a later edition addresses this issue.
2. At least in my experience, this game can be extremely frustrating come mid/late game if you are not winning, which can sour the experience.  With our group, by the last few generations, there's a clear winner, and there's often little you can do to stop them, as they're already ahead and simply producing more than everyone else, so catching up is nearly impossible. This leaves other players frustrated by the end of the game as they're just watching themselves lose.
3. Your interactions with other players are pretty much entirely sour experiences.  They eliminate some of your resources, you take a spot on the board they were eyeing, they take a milestone on the turn before you were going to claim it.  Lots of exchanging bitter blows.
4. Outside of skilled play through experience, this game can boil down to luck of the draw, especially with a strong opening hand.",best board games
