"Just FYI, feeder goldfish get huge (up to 18 inches long), live 30+ years, and two require a minimum of 55 gallons. Please check out r/goldfish for more advice...they're far from the easy starter pets everyone thinks."
And ebooks!  it's my favorite!
So? It works exactly like it did two weeks ago.

"That's where you are still mistaken. It is not just the number of instruments that makes percussion difficult. Even specialising in just one instrument is difficult, for instance any of these: snare drum, timpani, marimba, vibraphone, tambourine.

People underestimate how much goes into learning to hit something to produce a good sound."
"What's the closest thing to an LG Gram 16 that uses a Ryzen processor?  Good display, taller aspect ratio, good battery life."
The list is bullshit. No point complaining in this sub though.
LIGHT BLUE IS MY JAM
"Well, everything is an RPG these days. It's almost a meaningless term. 

To me, I know what I think of as an RPG. HZD definitely has RPG elements. 

Either way, my point was that the guy above me was inconsistent. Calling Witcher and Bloodborne RPGs is fine, but you can't omit HZD then."
"Is Texas still your legal state of residence, or are you having to pay tax in whatever state you're currently in?

(Texas: No state income tax!)"

"I make a stout herbal tea, very hot, with two cloves. Then i put the juice of at least half a lemon in, a huge spoon of honey, and two shots of makers mark, then finish it off with a thin slice of the best butter available. Take a benadryl, then this. Make sure you pee before you pass out. 

It always makes the drinker feel better, but mainly you care less that you feel bad, so it's hitting you from both angles."
I work near the airport and never had issues on my Pixel 4XL on Fi.
Nah i need something that tells me it needs attention.  Feeding my pets multiple times a day? No problem but giving that fucking cactus some water? Nope i forgot that thing for 3 years straight
"I know, right? Who could have forseen that?"
"In June my brother committed suicide and it has my mother absolutely destroyed.. but she has a giant urn on the fireplace in remembrance of him, I found these beautiful colorful stone urns I'll attach a picture in a moment, but that is what I am getting her."
"Yeah because that’s a practical way to spread knowledge to everybody... the fact that I need to pay to have a subscription to see scientific articles is an obstacle to me and everyone else like me when it comes to being an informed citizen. Then you have to be able to discern what is a good paper and what isn’t, and if you rely on using papers that have been cited the most, then you rely on the majority being right which isn’t always the case. So I guess I have to send an email to the author of every single paper I want to review personally. This is a neat trick but doesn’t solve the bigger issue here which is the fact that knowledge is hidden behind too many barriers for the average person to get through reasonably. We gotta find a better way"
"If you travel, yes. If you will just be in a general area, ask friends or family."

"4 SB wins, ZERO interceptions ZERO! A record that will never be broken, guaranteed!"
"One thing I would say is you may well come across the issue OP was discussing in that subreddit too. I asked around there when building my pc and most people were pushing me to get better parts when I already stated I was spending £1000 MAX.

I have the PC I decided on and stream everything on ultra with no issues at all but the advice I was being given said I'd struggle. People love to spend other people's money."

"I think it definitely takes a different kind of skill to make clean comedy work. Anyone can make a story about sex or shit or farting or whatever funny, but to tell a joke with none of those elements and still have it be funny is, as you said, definitely hard to pull off. DOn't get me wrong, I love the raunchiest of comedians, and I don't think what they do is easy in the least, but I do have a certain respect for the former, especially because I don't think I could do it."
I only have least favorites: Ubuntu (flakey) CentOS7 (buggy)
Have you tried Grammarly's premium product? It seems to do all of this.
