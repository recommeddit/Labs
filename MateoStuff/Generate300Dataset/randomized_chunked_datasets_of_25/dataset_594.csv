34019,best Pokemon game,Sorry I’m going to sound really stupid here but what does that mean? What versions are those?
55838,best action and adventure movie,Nice collection there! Thanks for the list of movies.
24281,best anime,"I think I like that list even more hahah. NGE, LotGH, Mushishi, Tatami, Gintama, Afterstory, Monster, Madoka, and Monogatari are all so damn good so it’s nice to see them in there. The only problem I had with your original list was Clannad being ranked higher than Afterstory, since that’s one of the only shows where I think the sequel is far better than the original"

46504,best trick or treating candy,"I leave in North East PA and I frequent many stores /gas stations, not once have I seen a MARS bar, and thought it was just foreign and/or more popular in other states. During my childhood I have never received a MARS bar at Halloween.

 Seems like the general consensus is many people in PA have not had Mars bars. I think the real result is most likely M&Ms or Reeses"

62539,Best RPG game on PS4,"I just got Kingdom Come Deliverance for 20 bucks last week and I'm really enjoying it. It doesn't always perform that great on my OG ps4 but other than performance, I think it's really great. It's really deep and has a pretty big learning curve, but it's pretty rewarding once you start getting the hang of things"

55616,best action and adventure novel series,"If you want something like Tolkien, stick to high fantasy. If you are just getting into reading again I would start with one of the smaller series, something in the 1-5 book range, or a series that just started. There is a lot of excitement in waiting for a new book. Some great authors to check out are: Brandon Sanderson, L.E. Modesitt Jr., Peter Brett, Patrick Rothfuss, Jim Burchers Codex Alera, Terry Goodkind, Trudi Canavan, Brent Weeks, and Robert Jordan(long series). Personaly I""m most excited about Brandon Sanderson's The Way Of Kings. One of the most unique and beautifuly written books I've ever read, I can't wait for the rest of the series."
