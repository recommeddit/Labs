32497,best vacation resort,"I have stayed at the RIU Ocho Rios in Jamaica twice, both times I tipped the bartenders at the bar closest to my suite when I arrived and the service was literally impeccable, they would pick my friends and I out of a crowd and serve us right away, I would be walking by and they would call me over just to shoot the shit if they weren't busy, no complaints."

51609,best iphone case,"The saddle is actually really disgusting. If I had another one to compare it to for a photo you‚Äôd be able to tell. 

The orange is only a few months old and I‚Äôve been spending a lot of the summer hiking and camping so the smart battery case has been my primary case. 

The smaller orange is also super disgusting, but hard to see without a comparison."
69800,best major to study in college,"I did Comp Sci. Pay is great, but long hours and stress.

If I were to do it again, I would consider:

4 year law enforcement degree at a local school. Become a cop, work your way up. Retire in 20 years with a nice pension, move into some other career at your leisure.

Some kind of trade (plumber, electrician, welder, etc.). Do a trade program and apprentice as quickly as possible. Also do part-time school for a business degree at a local school (even just a 2 year). Grind for 10 years and then start your own shop.

Both of these offer a ""cheap"" education (no crippling debt) and aren't as susceptible to the AI/automation/robot change that will likely come during your working years."

25412,best cricket teams of all time,lolwut
25846,best cricket teams of all time,"I remember Michael Holding saying the West Indies 80s team was absolute freakish that all those great players were all at the same time.
