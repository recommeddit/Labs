Its free software and avaiable also for MacOS

https://xournalpp.github.io/

Thats the new site, so for more information you could use their github page as described in the link:)

I want to mention, that i use xournal++ with two graphic tables (one from XP Pen and one Wacom) with Windows and with GNU/Linux it works just great. But i never tried xournal++ with MacOS. Simply because i dont have a Mac yet :)",best mac app to annotate pdf with wacom tablet reddit
11368,"My dad doesn't really talk with me or my siblings at all really anymore, but just talking with him and enjoying his hobbies was always a great time. He loved to hike and play video games (from what recall) so whenever I got to do that with him I was so happy. Nothing will ever replace me waking up early when I was probably 8 or 9 so that I could watch him play video games, only to have him pass me the controller and play the game I had wanted for months. I miss him a lot, but my memories of him will always be great. 

Seriously, enjoy your dads hobbies/interests. Not only will he love it, but you'll learn a lot about him and enjoy it a lot yourself.",best gifts for dad

I havent bought a laptop in probably 15 years. currently i have an ipad, but i want a proper computer -  im just looking for standard stuff, excel, streaming, some torrentting, etc. No gaming (console player), or at the most, very light gaming. I'd like it to be able to cast to my TV (Samsung). I dont care too much about battery life, but id prefer something quiet and not overly bullky. I live in Spain which maybe is making things complex as i dont always find the ones on your list with the right specs. My budget is as cheap as possible! id like something between 500-800€ if possible.",best laptop for general use

48483,"I’m not sure painting will make any difference with the smell, but it’ll help with the overall vibe.

We moved into a new house in June and just painted last week because I wanted time to get a feel for the living areas and the style direction we wanted to go in. 

Things to think about: 
1. How much light comes into the room and do you want to emphasize that or downplay it?
2. Colors of your furniture and accents. Is this the beginning of full-on redecorating, or do you want to complement the stuff you already have.
3. What vibe do you want in the room. Should it be calming, invigorating, neutral? What colors give you the feeling you want?

I used Pinterest to get an idea of room styles and to look at a bunch of color palettes and decide what appealed to me overall. It’s also a good way to incorporate what you already have.",best color to paint with

4130,"most community colleges and pretty much all the major universities ranging from AU, UNLV, UCLA, SD State, SRJC, etc etc etc have great online programs and you can visit the teachers who run the online classes.


I know a lot of business owners and dine with them and attend their conferences and what not. Also knowing a handful of proffsionals a lot of them expressed how they absolutely loath for profit schools like ITT tech, Devry (lol), Lincoln College, University of Pheonix, Kaplen college and how they'd never ever hire anybody who attended these schools.


You have to be one dumb mother fucker to attend these schools.


For me, personally when I call in a tech for issues with my computers I make sure it isn't someone with ITT Tech on their resume.

68660,"> The Martian by Andy Weir. It has it's critics and I get where they're coming from especially after Artemis, but I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it so it must have something going for it.

Honestly, the biggest thing that *The Martian* has going against it for any sort of attention or award in the industry is that it was self-published. That's why you can find dozens of articles from NPR reviewers and editors talking about *Artemis*, but only two mentions of *The Martian* ever even existing as a book.",best science fiction novel
