69867,best major to study in college,"Mathematics student here, here's my input:

Pros:

- There seems to be many post-college options, especially if you have to learn programming as well like we do here.

- If you like challenges and love math, it can be very enjoyable at times

- Not that many people want to study just mathematics in college, most take CS or something like that instead, thus, you will have classes that very few people attend, the ones only for math students. Which can be quite fun compared to the huge lectures that have hundreds of students attending. You'll also get more personal attention.

Cons:

- It's hard, often really hard. Even if you were good at math in high school. Being good at math in high school helps but does not guarantee that you will do well when you major in math, especially if you are used to just memorizing a lot of stuff. 

- No matter how much you like maths, some of the material will be boring. Math requires a lot of precision, thus there are so many little details to remember about everything that can make a beautiful theorem seem quite boring. And those little details must not be missed, ever.

- Mathematicians tend to be very strict, I have classes where you can absolutely not redo a test, even if you are sick that day. And details matter, you will lose points on tests even if you understand the general idea but miss details.

- You'll have very little free time, there is a ton of homework and a lot of classes (I just had two big tests today and an exam yesterday). In many majors, you will just have lectures, in math, you will have lectures and classes to practice mathematics. My roommate literally has half as many hours I have that she has to spend at school and very little homework while I also have a lot of homework which is often quite challenging. There is a lot of information to learn and unlike many other majors, math requires a lot of practice.

- (can be a pro, depending on the person!) It is nothing like math in high school, it will be a whole different kind of mathematics. Like one of my professors says ""Mathematics is the art of proofs"". There is a lot of proofs and you have to think about maths very differently.

Overall, I am very happy with my choice to study mathematics but it is not for everyone."

30553,best Mexican war to study,"I'm British, not American, and neither have I been formally educated in history, but here's me 2 cents for the ones I actually know a little about:

US Revolution - AFAIK the American colonists did indeed pay the lowest taxes of all colonies. Their issue was not the tax itself, but the fact that they were paying tax without a member of parliament to represent them (the representation part of ""no taxation without representation"" is very important!). I'm not sure the exact level of support for the revolution at the time, but I do know that huge numbers of people loyal to the crown moved North after it occurred (it's one of the reasons why Quebec never really had enough support for its own revolution, iirc). I guess that given the depth of feeling, some sort of revolution was bound to occur at some stage.

War of 1812 - Dunno much about it, but I guess a second war was inevitable to ""settle accounts"" after the first.

Civil war - About as valid or invalid as the revolutionary war, surely?

Spanish-American war - Unjustified. An attempt by the US to ""prove itself"" on the world stage as one of the Great Powers.

World wars - both justified, but the US turned up late to both of them. :P

Korea/Vietnam - Justified in a historical context. It wasn't just the US randomly messing in small countries' affairs, it was about stemming the tide of communism. There was a real fear that, if left unchecked, it could spread much further.

Gulf War I - Justified in keeping the expansionism of a regional power in check.

Afghanistan - Justified. Remember that the government in Afghanistan was the Taliban, and as such the country was a safe base of operations for groups definitely hostile to the US/west.

I'd also argue that the recent intervention in Libya was justified, and any possible (but probably unlikely) intervention in Syria would also be justified."
