7631,best laptop for general use,Hey I need some advice! I'm looking to buy a new laptop for college and I'm deciding between the surface laptop 3 and the mac book air with M1. I'm a finance major so I won't be doing any gaming or anything I really only need it for Microsoft office like word and excel and streaming on Netflix and stuff. They're both around the same weight and storage also isn't too much of a concern for me because I probably won't need much. I'm not too knowledgeable on computers and just wanted some advice and opinions. :)))
58906,best perfume,"This feels super hard for me because my favorites change and it totally depends on my mood, the season, what I'm doing etc. And my bottles aren't in front of me so lord knows I'm forgetting something. So I'm winging it. 30f.

2.) Cour des Senteurs Versailles - Guerlain  
3.) Chergui - Serge Lutens  
4.) Shalimar - Guerlain  
5.) Mitsouko - Guerlain

7.) Legare - Deconstructing Eden (indie)  
8.) Coco Mademoiselle - Chanel  
9.) Walk the Sea - Kerosene

JK - You're going to get a ton of subjective replies here. Try them out and see what you prefer, as everyone is different here."
4471,best text editor,"I use both VSCode and Intellej. VSCode for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. IntelliJ for Java AND no it is not slow like what other people said it actually helps me code Java faster."

19102,best YouTube video,"Ah Ryan George's Pitch Meetings, the guy has such a great sense of humor. I'd also recommend those"
72427,best keyboard switches,"Honestly it's all personal preference. Some websites will try to sell you on ""reds for gaming, blues for typing, etc."", but the best thing to do is to try out the switches yourself, either buy a switch tester or see if any of your friends have a  keyboard you could try. Educate yourself on the difference of switches and see what you think you would like yourself. I'm an advocate for MX Browns myself, or any tactile switch for typing (Brown, Clear, Blue, Green)."

54014,best medicine for a cold,Just buy distilled water. 99cents
51129,best rap album,"> Yeah, the list as a whole is very biased towards rock music


I think the criticism that there aren't other genres included in this list is kind of silly. You could certainly criticise NME for being ignorant/indifferent to non-UK Rock acts, but it seems rather pointless as it's fairly obvious what kind of music NME is interested in. It's like chiding Kerrang for not including Pet Sounds."

32620,best vacation resort,"My wife and I honeymooned at the Sandals Royal Caribbean in the Bahamas for 9 days. It was fantastic! Great service, good food, beautiful beach and we had a lot of fun exploring town too. 11 restaurants on site offered a lot of variety -  though with any all-inclusive check availability since not all restaurants are open all the time. Definitely plan to do another Sandals trip again."
