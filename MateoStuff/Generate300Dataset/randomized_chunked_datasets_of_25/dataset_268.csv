71336,best movies with a cool twist,"I'm also surprised about not seeing the original Planet of the Apes in the comments. It must've been shocking for people when they first watched in the cinema back then. Still holds up to this day, but couldn't make it on my Top 10 list. It must be like 11th. I put Invisible Guest before it because there are so many twists, literally the whole movie is about twists. Just when you think 'ok, this is the final twist, right?' and it gives you another one and another one lol."

46835,best hand santizer brand,"I don't know from CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS, but I've read about a few studies comparing soap and water usage and diarrhea rates in the third world that suggested that good old S&W did a fantastic job - drastically reducing the incidence of infectious diarrhea by about a third.  That may not sound like much, but many of these people also do not have access to clean water, the ingestion of which is likely to be responsible for a majority of cases.  Note that the S&W rates were far better than water alone, which suggests that plain old soap is a very effective means of preventing infection.

Here's one example:  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080122203221.htm"

43629,best items under $100,"A kitchen scale. 

Completely changed my food consumption, since I could easily measure portions. I learned what they actually SHOULD be, not what we in the US act like they are. That + MyFitnessPal (the free version, even!) = Me losing 120lbs over 18 months and developing a much healthier relationship with food and eating. Very simple tools, but great for enacting real, lasting change üëç"

12562,best gifts for mom,"My dad always made sure he bought us stuff to give to my mum on Christmas, her birthday and Mother's Day. Now all he has to do is remind my brother.

He didn't one year and he turned up about 4 hours later than planned, still high on coke with a birthday card, on Mother's Day. It's the only time I've seen my mum cry unhappy tears on Mother's Day."
72322,best keyboard switches,Yeah okay thats fair enough
6863,best iPhone,"Straight out of the box it would never switch to LTE that lasted for months until one day it finally kicked in. Could not hear on it AT ALL had to always use speaker and the battery life was absolutely terrible. Phone signal was poor too, my husband and I both had same carrier and his 5s at the time would have signal in places my 6s plus wouldn‚Äôt."

2758,best headphones,"The regular Cloud Flight doesn't have mic monitoring/sidetone, which was a deal breaker for me. Its software is also terrible with no EQ option---nothing besides volume/mute/battery level. Such a shame because I liked it besides that.

The Cloud Flight S is supposed to remedy this by adding sidetone, but it's not clear whether the software will be any better for these. Is there an EQ option that magically appears when you plug in the Flight S instead of the regular Flights? I'm also wary of the complaints about really bad 7.1 sound and white noise, which wasn't present at all on the Cloud Flight."

43592,best items under $100,"A good chef's knife and a cast iron skillet. When you have tools that are satisfying to use, cooking becomes less ""chore"" and more ""hobby"". You'll end up eating healthier, cheaper than takeout/restaurant, and ditching the dull Walmart knife and scratched up nonstick aluminum skillet are the best place to start.

Editing to add:

Since so many are asking what to get: Victorinox 8"" or 10"" chef's knife, and 10"" lodge cast iron skillet. These in my opinion are at the tippy top of the curve on quality to price ratio. 

These probably leave enough room in the budget to get a $2 steel from goodwill and a large butcher block cutting board. As long as you use the steel with some regularity, a good knife should go a long time before it actually needs to be sharpened.

Second edit: I agree that a good sharpener is important, but if you have $100 to spend today you can wait on sharpener as long as you have a steel to maintain the edge. You will need one, but not today. 

Also I am going to take another look at carbon steel skillets."
