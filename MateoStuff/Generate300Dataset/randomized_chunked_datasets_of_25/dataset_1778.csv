56517,best desktop monitor,Hey man thanks for the link. I’m new to PC components and looking to get a PC soon. Would either the 24’ or 27’ work with a 580 4gb + i5 8400? I wouldn’t mind turning settings down but I’m thinking it might not be enough. I’d want at least 40 frames on most games
73259,best Linux distro,"OpenSUSE Tumbleweed as the Linux distro with KDE Plasma as the desktop environment. Give it a shot!

Also consider giving Manjaro a shot. Both are nice, but I prefer openSUSE TW because if things get messed up, the way the file system works allows you to roll back to a previous snapshot. The snapshots are auto taken whenever you update."

54943,best water filter,"You are using ""coagulant"", do you not ""flocculant""?"
68409,best science fiction novel,"I would strongly recommend you read the 5th book, Urth of the New Sun. I think it's technically considered a sequel, but it's really more of an epilogue that revisits the events of the previous books and shines light on what really happened in key moments. It completely changed the way I saw the first four books and in my opinion, the story is not complete without it."
