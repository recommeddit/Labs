I thought you had just misspelled pie.
I think I'm two books in to that series ðŸ˜Š
"Honestly, I respect him so much more for being able to pull himself out of that hole.  People who hate on him have no idea what addiction is, he fought a war single-handedly and won.

My hats off to him and even better to hear he is a swell guy!

Edit: Also, if you have known anyone that has gotten hooked on smack, you know they usually show permanent signs of damage once they are clean(e.g. broken speech, inability to communicate ideas/thoughts well, muscle spasms or ticks).  RDJr got lucky and inherited a Hunter-S-Thompson-esque playboy demeanor that really shines, especially when he plays Iron man (that movie really grew on me)"
"I own the raiden mid, should i get the hien? Whats your opinion about the hien?"
Personally I like *the one* by D&G but it never seems to last more than 2 hours on my skin for some reason
How do you like the leather case? Iâ€™m thinking of getting it
Dark rum and ginger or coke.
"not saying it happens but if a dentist was to say to me ""i recommend colgate"". im going to assume he is getting something for saying that. after all toothpastes are all basically the same. i should know because i buy whatever is the cheapest at the time and have for decades and aside form flavor there is no difference."
The production on Black Up gives me chills every time
"This is what we call the ""college freshman"""
I have the GL83A and I can confirm it is the best monitor I have ever seen/used for gaming.
Nah you put forth an informative comment and I appreciate it. Reddit is just ridiculous at times.
"Floss on a stick guy here. I honestly cannot do regular floss. The floss on a stick is way better imo may not be as effective but it makes the experience a lot less painful. 

Floss before it's too late kids."
"I've met Dave Chappelle a few times. Nice guy, but he often looked really sad to me. This was shortly before he went to South Africa for his mental health, so I'm guessing my observation that he looked sad was accurate. 

Most of Reddit is probably too young to know this one, but I also met Zsa Zsa Gabor when I was a kid. She was an absolute sweetheart, and was very nice to me during a time when I really needed a few kind words. I was sad when she passed a few years back. 

I have laid eyes on a few other celebrities, but rarely had enough interaction to form much of an opinion on them."
LISTEN
"Wow! Thanks. It looks like a standard response.

You probably tried and did it, but let me ask - have you tried to add all your testing devices in AdMob?"
"Something about the South African ODI ranking for the last three years just doesn't look right to me. I don't know if it's indicative of the quality and strength of the team they were in that period compared to the opposition in the top 6 - also, I'd rather that graph was top 8 rather than 6, so that NZ and Windies were in there."
Can't go wrong with most of Villeneuve's work but I just watched *Incendies* and yeah. It's a good one.
Best food ever ? Best drink ever ? ...
"I just wear what the girls im with when shopping suggest generally..

Ive got Porshe stuff, Ralph Lauren Polo Travel Exclusive, Ralph Lauren Double Black."
I rode my motorcycle through the night once and found myself in Canyonlands National Park at sunrise. I had to stop I was surrounded such immense natural beauty.
"What do you mean by ""good at""? Do you want to play classical music from sheet music, or learn basic chords so you can jam with other musicians for fun? The second one will take less time."
">I love pushing ice too. I thought this book was widely disliked?

Hardly, it's probably his second most recommended novel after House of Suns"
"My wild guess based on your selection, dear op, is that you're within the first 5-10 years of your career and unsure if you want to stick with it or attempt a change.  You've gotten a few raises so are hesitant to start at the bottom somewhere else, but unsure of how to make a ""lateral"" change to a completely different field.  You used to wear high heels, but are finding your tolerance for foot pain is decreasing."
"good kid, m.A.A.d city by Kendrick Lamar is my favorite album of all time. Itâ€™s unique, the production is fantastic, Kendrick raps his ass off, and it tells a fantastic story. Iâ€™d highly recommend it"
