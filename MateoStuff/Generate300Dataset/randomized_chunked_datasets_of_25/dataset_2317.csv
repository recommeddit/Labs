15516,best tree for the garden,"Thank you, I'm less than novice at gardening and pleaching scares me somewhat - I'll look it up but if my black fingers (things wither and die) have anything to do with it I might mess up. I love the idea though and think that it will be a slow process, ideally I'd love to rip the sycamore out and plop one right in - but maintenance is where I fall short. I'll watch some videos and see how I feel! Thanks again for your suggestions."

She went to Wellesey and visits her grandmother every other Saturday.  She's a nice girl - why don't you really get to know her?  You both have a lot in common.  You both like the Facebook and listen to the same talking music with the African American gentlemen.

49462,best gaming monitor,"Id say get a freesnyc monitor thats g-sync compatible so you dont get the unnecessary price markup. I am looking to build a 1440p144hz build myself and Im going to use the Samsung C27HG79. https://pcpartpicker.com/product/z6YWGX/samsung-c27hg70-269-2560x1440-144hz-monitor-lc27hg70qqnxza

Heres a review of it: https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/chg70 I generally recommend this website if you want to compare monitors.

41051,best instrument to play,"In my opinion, there is no answer to this generally, as practice time is directly correlated to improvement on every instrument.

Now I will say if you're want to narrow the question a bit to something like, ""what instrument will let me play [genre] songs with the least time investment"", that changes things. I used to teach a rock camp for kids and I've had 6 year olds drumming AC/DC in a couple weeks without prior experience. It's not mastery or getting particularly ""good"" but they can certainly jam to the ol' 1 and 3."
