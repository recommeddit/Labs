We were told Lowes no longer does this. We tried when we bought some power tools this weekend.
Came here to say this.
"Same among the main sisters, Cait is probably my least favorite of the whole family."
DMAA
"I think Perfect Blue was a lot better than Paprika. Paprika felt like it was trying to be weird and random for the heck of it but Perfect Blue legit fucked my mind. Without spoiling anything, I had to look up an explanation afterwards to even understand it."
Aladdin's!!!!
Isn't the Dell not IPS tho? I like its ergonomic form tho
Shocked nobody else has mentioned these. I love mine.
"Kurt Adelberger (astronomer) is the best writer of scientific papers I've come across. Ha manages to put popular-science-style exciting prose into professional research papers. An example here:

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401445

The first paragraph:

>As the photons from the microwave background stream towards earth they are gradually joined by other photons, first by those produced in the occasional recombinations of the intergalactic medium, later by those cast off from cooling H2 molecules, later still, after hundreds of millions of years, by increasing numbers from quasars and galaxies, by bremsstrahlung from the hot gas in galaxy groups and clusters, and finally, shortly before impact, by photons emitted by the Milky Way‚Äôs own gas and stars and dust. All reach the earth together. They provide a record of the history of the universe throughout its evolution, but it is a confused record. Two photons that simultaneously pierce the same pixel of a detector may have been emitted billions of years apart by regions of the universe that were in vastly different stages of evolution. One of the challenges in observational cosmology is to separate the layers of history that we on earth receive superposed."
Is it like Konosuba? I'm watching that now. Re:Zero isn't comedy right?
"No, the guy can clearly see that I use the account for audiobook downloads, while he uses it for finance and business books. If it really was a stolen account, they would have booted me months ago. Every time you open the app it shows recent usage, there's no way to hide it."
"After searching for something decent at second hand stores I finally broke down and got [this](http://www.staples.ca/en/Catalina-Lighting-Vision-Max-Swing-Arm-Magnifier-Lamp-22W-Black/product_802639_2-CA_1_20001)

It's got a magnifying glass in the center so it's great if you do any sort of hands-on work, but the lamp itself is also quite nice."
"If you‚Äôre a fan of simpler sushi and a focus on delicious fish, I agree with Arigato over some of the others mentioned.

I‚Äôll also second Paxti‚Äôs for pizza, I always end up there people watching from their great bar facing State Street,  amazing deep dish pizza I‚Äòbe been known to drive from LA for.

If you have a vegetarian in the group I highly suggest Vegan GreenGO on State.  I‚Äôve only been there once but they make all their own ‚Äúmeats‚Äù and they were all truly delicious. Go even if you aren‚Äôt vegetarian and balance out one of your more indulgent meals!

The Palace is great for a satisfying Cajun experience with friends. It‚Äôs been so popular for years I don‚Äôt think it gets mentioned here much, similar to La SuperRica for tacos."
Same thing with gaming. Everything is cookie cutter bland bullshit. With multiplayer games at least.
"I‚Äôm using the Apple silicone. I still can‚Äôt believe I spent $50 on a silicone case. I figured it would be higher quality than other brands, time will tell."
"My fav is Kim, she seems so nice, hardworking and after all she is the main star here"
"Long list, haven‚Äòt recognized it üòÅ

FlicksForAll works on iOS 14, so does NoTrackpadDelay."
"Apple actually has this thing called a ‚Äúface time‚Äù and I know it‚Äôs hard to see, but if you look closely at your iPhone you‚Äôll actually see a 12mp  webcam!

Seriously though, decent camera sensors alone aren‚Äôt cheap. Sony probably has a major market share and Logitech probably just buys the low end sensors from suppliers like them. People often think Logitech is a great company and sometimes they make nice toys but they‚Äôre ultimately low quality, nice looking, and convenient. They‚Äôre like the Bose of computer peripherals."
How To Get Away With Murder. period.
"I pick up the SF Chronicle nearly every day, mainly for the crosswords, as they keep me sane and busy on the bus."
"Hey, I was using the official updated course. I am an opinionated user, and Max sucks big time. The first 10 hours are super great, then the BS starts. I don't understand anything and I can't follow that guy."
Spread the word!
"I used to go to Menards for everything but I feel like in the last 5 to 6 years, the quality of some of their products (kitchen and bath, tools and flooring to name a few) has trended towards the cheaper end. I worked there for four years when I was in high school and college, so I tried to stay loyal but I've made the jump to Home Depot for most of my home improvement needs. I only go to Menards in a pinch because it's closer.

As for HD or Lowes, they seem pretty similar from my experience."
How much of the game can I feasibly enjoy as a full blown f2p scrub? Games like these seem to have end game stuff so far out of reach for those without a budget to whale.
That's a really cute idea. I've never seen those before. Thank you.
