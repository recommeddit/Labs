Hearing stories and powerful messages help push me in a further way. 

Along with that, youtube has alot of really well put together motivational videos with speeches cut into very motivating music. Def a look into if you are searching for music.

25680,"70s-80s WI had to face   
England - Gooch, Boycott, Gower, Botham, Willis, Underwood, Knott  
Australia - Chappell brothers, Border, Lillee, Thompson, Mallet  
Pakistan -Miandad, Abbas, Imran  
India - Gavaskar, Viswanath, Vengsarkar, Kapil, Kirmani and the spin quartet (Not a weak team as you suggested)  
NZ was competitive with Hadlee  

Again we are talking about an era where 50+ average is pretty much impossible unlike now there seems to be couple per team.  

90s-00 Aus team had to face  

England - Peterson  
India - Tendulkar, Dravid, VVS  
Pakistan - Inzamam, Wasim, Waquar  
NZ - ??  
SA - Kirsten, Kallis, Donald, Pollock  
SL - De Silva, Murali    

So, I wouldn't come to a conclusion that WI had to face weaker sides.  In my biased opinion, WI beat everybody at home and on the road handily for a long period of time. Aus never beat India in India. That settles the argument for me.",best cricket teams of all time

37844,"It’s definitely a top tier origin movie, but it wasn’t without big flaws in my opinion. I really liked the first two acts of the movie, they felt more grounded. It got a little crazy in the third act, but there were some great moments so it was forgivable. The way they killed Wenwu, one of the best villains in the MCU, was not forgivable. I couldn’t believe they did him like that. Also, the way Katy killed the soul sucker with just one arrow with one day of training did not make any sense. I feel like wandavision suffered a similar third act problem where they had an amazing, creative show and it devolved into a DBZ fight in the end. 

I did really like it though. Gonna probably see it again soon.",best Marvel movie
