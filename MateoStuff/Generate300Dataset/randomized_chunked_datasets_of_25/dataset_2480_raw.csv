And maybe Lime soon? I’m skittles overwhelmed tbh
"Agreed, this will forever be the best breakfast. After a night out it's even better!"
"Easy to imagine that Robin Williams would be one of the nicest celebrities out there. Always seemed to be such a great guy. Him, and Tom Hanks."
Season 5 tomorrow!
Check out Prey. It's an open world first person shooter with horror and sci-fi elements. My favorite game this generation.

I was so mad with the ending of season 1 I never really got into season 2.  I gave the series another shot because my wife wanted to watch it and oh man was season 2 fantastic.  All of the seasons are a good mystery.
