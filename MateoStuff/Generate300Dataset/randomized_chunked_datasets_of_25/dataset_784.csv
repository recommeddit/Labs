61771,Best RPG game on PS4,"It's an Action Rpg. After the opening, it's as much rpg as everyother rpg."
26208,best politician,Truman- The man to me was just amazing- He basically was some farmer with a high school education who no one thought would be that good of a Senator or president and he turned out okay- Plus I feel like his plan for universal health care would have been good- i'm not even a dem and I find him to be a wonderful person and president
32130,best hotel to live in,"Not even a hotel - an airbnb in Sneek, Netherlands - built in Sauna in the room and they had a sausage dog puppy. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ"
66919,best soccer team in the world,"They were the best team in the world in the late 40s and early 50s.
It was a big surprise back then, when Germany beat them in the final.

[Ferenc Puskas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_Pusk%C3%A1s) still is a national hero."
29318,best game console,For me it is the DS. It is the last gaming console where I spent more time playing instead of researching about games.
36068,best alcoholic drink,"whiskey. best consumed before, during, and after workout."
7042,best iPhone,"Donâ€˜t forget space. For some reason there isnâ€˜t a 512 GB version of the non-Pro iPhone. I like to have my whole music collection with me and use the iPhone as an audio player / DAP and that was the only reason I had to opt for the Pro version. Well, I also preferred the smaller size."
42389,movies like Inception,All of the above. I especially like that the plots and all that actually involve people's minds
21839,best winnie the pooh comic,This feels like the hundred acres variant of dolan and gooby.
7020,best iPhone,First Iâ€™ve realised the 11 Pro was slightly smaller than the 11! Bezels shouldâ€™ve been a clue..
60215,best freezer brand,"Having a freezer in a hot area will always make it work harder for two reasons.  The first is that it's simply hotter so the inside warms up faster.  The second is that the efficiency of all cooling devices decreases the hotter the ""exhaust"" temperature is.  This means that as it gets hotter outside each unit of cooling will take longer to achieve. 

 I'm not sure there is such a thing as a definitive bifl chest freezer on the market today because they can all have compressor issues.  My freezer strategy is to just buy the cheap small chest freezers from lowes and replace them as needed.  I have two of them and the oldest has been running fine for 5 or 6 years.  The newest is only a few months old.  I haven't had one fail yet.

You also need to manually defrost it maybe once or twice a year or that makes it work harder because the frost acts as an insulator and keeps the cooling tubes from doing their job."
12970,best gifts for mom,"Cool, well best of luck. Moving to different states is always a pain in the ass but it's also cool to experience different parts of the country. If you aren't tied down with a purchased home/kids, you have an advantage over a large number of job seekers with your ability to relocate."
42844,best detective show,"Nope, last I heard, it's completely cancelled."
57228,best water brand,"Worked Food & Beverage industry for 30â€™years.  Have run bottled water lines with spring, mineral, sparkling and flat.  Some pumped out of ground.  Most is tap water sent through RO and mineral added back for regional taste or just left filtered.  Bottlers more concerned about cost of caps and bottles.  The water is almost an afterthought.  Itâ€™s all H2O."
73629,best battery bank,"That sucks. Quick search found that some people also couldn't get the default charger to work while a slow charger was fine, so it's seriously a Pixel/Google problem. 

Then again, my Xperia XZ2 will only take the USB C cable one way so USB-C clearly still needs some robustness/compatibility improvements."
57067,best water brand,I am quite partial to any water with a chemical composition of H2O
