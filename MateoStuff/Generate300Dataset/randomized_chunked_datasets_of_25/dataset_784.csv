60215,"Having a freezer in a hot area will always make it work harder for two reasons.  The first is that it's simply hotter so the inside warms up faster.  The second is that the efficiency of all cooling devices decreases the hotter the ""exhaust"" temperature is.  This means that as it gets hotter outside each unit of cooling will take longer to achieve. 

 I'm not sure there is such a thing as a definitive bifl chest freezer on the market today because they can all have compressor issues.  My freezer strategy is to just buy the cheap small chest freezers from lowes and replace them as needed.  I have two of them and the oldest has been running fine for 5 or 6 years.  The newest is only a few months old.  I haven't had one fail yet.

You also need to manually defrost it maybe once or twice a year or that makes it work harder because the frost acts as an insulator and keeps the cooling tubes from doing their job.",best freezer brand
