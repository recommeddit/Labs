44767,"Volume, pretty much.

I'll first clarify since this isn't a brewing sub, ""kettle"" in brewing means a pot, basically. You can absolutely make beer with whatever pot you've got lying around, it's just for heating mash water and boiling the beer with the hops. But a ""typical"" batch size is 5 gallons into the fermentor, which means about 6 gallons before you start boiling, and it foams up so you need space above that. Many people start out with a Canadian Tire turkey fryer pot/propane burner.  I eventually upgraded from that to a 10 gallon kettle from Spike - stainless steel, welded-in ports for valve and thermometer, thick 3 ply bottom. Some people buy 15 or 20 gallon kettles to produce 10 gallons at a time. Above that you're starting to look at professional equipment.",best items under $100

Everything is fine until you make your account and then everything is locked off till you log in from a computer (I don't have one).
If you try not making an account it's just an endless cycle of trying to coerce you into doing it.

Tend to use the former 2 more for gaming since I work a lot on my PC already and don't have too much time for gaming, so I usually rather want to hop in a sofa and boot up my game rather then having to potentially deal with compatibility problems, tweaking settings to my hardware etc....  


I only play exclusives and games that really benefit from modding (like Bethesda games, outside Skyrim since I love that on switch), latest RE games don't really have any game changing mods and are optimized enough that they play great on console vs my PC imo, so I'll be getting these on ps4/5.",best gaming system

I gave him considerable thought. He was a great player, but he played in an era when it was a bit easier for bowlers and wasn't able to play many tests, presumably just because they didn't play many back then. There were a few bowlers with ridiculously low averages back then. I went for Marshall and Garner instead because they performed exceptionally well and played many more tests in an era where it was more difficult for fast bowlers.",best cricket teams of all time
