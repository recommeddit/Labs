37732,"Okay so I believe the top 3 best movies marvel has made is:

3: Ironman 1 is the best Ironman movie by far and was made before Disney bought marvel so it has its own feeling to it and kick started the mcu. And Robert Downey jr IS Ironman!  They took a B list character that people should hate get humbled and become the most poplar character there is in the mcu. 

2: the winter soldier really stands out as it is a much darker and grittier movie than the rest of the mcu and puts cap against a different threat that he can’t simply punch in the face. Also it’s the best written captain America movie of his trilogy.

1: Infinity war… it’s the peak of the mcu everything that has been built up for a decade pays off in one of the most enjoyable movie of all time its a love letter to the fans it gathered through the decade and every single character, every single moment is satisfying. With one of the best written villains ever that even has people question if he’s in the wrong. The pacing is brilliant it never misses a beat and I’m not a huge music guy but the score was incredible. When Thor made his Entrance scene the theater lost its mind and than a few minutes later it was dead silent as we watched our hero’s fail. they couldn’t even avenge their comrades as the villain escapes and sits back and watches the sun set. 
 
Each of these movies are at the top of their game.

Now everyone and their mother knows that the hulk movie and the dark world are the two worse (I would put captain marvel as the third worst, because of plot holes and retcons) so I’m going to skip those and do the top 3 most disappointing mcu films IMO.

3: age of Ultron. Okay now stop reading this and go watch the age of ultron trailer on YouTube. 3 2 1 okay now that you’ve watched the trailer (lol) you can see what I mean. Totally different vibes then the movie we ended up getting, I still get chills watching that trailer but instead we got a worst avenger movie that mostly just set up plot points for future movies. And they Barely made use of ultron. 

2: black panther. I had to watch this about 2 weeks after it came out and I fell for the hype after seeing the reviews. Black panther has always been one of the coolest hero’s to me as I was first introduced to him in earths mightiest hero’s and then civil war came and all his scenes blew me away. But his own movie is by far one of the most boring marvel movies I have ever seen. He was sidelined in his own movie, not only does the villain out shine BP (by a lot) but the side characters were more charismatic and entertaining. He gets his ass kicked the whole movie And then infinity war and endgame comes along and he’s a badass again and sadly we will never see him get another try because Chadwick passed away Rip. Also   Vibranium can apparently do anything and everything. So long story short the overly positive reviews made my expectations really high for a hero I really love so I was severely disappointed by a mediocre movie.

1: Endgame…you know it to be true. 
time travel works super weird in this movie and created plot holes (which I hate because this is supposed to be a consisted universe looking at you MS marvel) people keep coming up with ways how old cap ended up on the bench but really they are just coping. 
I thought caps decision to remain in the past was extremely selfish the word needs him especially with all the chaos caused by people returning. Then he steals another mans wife Peggy. And he’s leaves Bucky behind WTF he literally almost dies multiple time for him and fights his friends and governments just to leave him for some different timeline Peggy carter puss. (he should of chose Bucky for the shield) 
Fat Thor… what a fking joke. People say it’s okay cause they “relate” to him but they make him the butt of every joke and give him no respect. In reality they did it to nerf him cause he was too strong but they are totally okay with captain marvel being op because she’s a woman. don’t even try to argue her whole movie is about girl power. 
Speaking of which that super forced A-force scene was super cringe and totally took me out of the movie. And once they all gather together marvel just blasts through everything on her own so it was pointless. 
Yet again they disrespect Thor by having him give up his kingdom to a drunk that fled her duty (I liked valkyries character but it still needs pointed out.) sorry but this Thor is not worthy of the hammer.
The pacing was really bad like the middle was super boring and no action. 
The final battle was cute but had no stakes everyone ends up fine and dandy besides Ironman who kill himself. Like this is a war for the universe but no hero’s  die in battle wtf.
Hulk gets turned into a soy boi and never gets his rematch. Unpopular opinion but I liked that BW saves Hawkeye he had a family she had no one but him so it fit her character but then they don’t even give her a funeral lmao 
Last but not least they butchered thanos character I get this is a younger thanos but he’s just another generic marvel villain and I think they did that because to many people liked thanos in IW and you can’t have that.

TLDR: best Ironman, winter soldier, infinity war.
Worst hulk, the dark world, captain marvel
Most disappointing ultron, BP, endgame
