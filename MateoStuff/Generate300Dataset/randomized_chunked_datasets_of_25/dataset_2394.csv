They don't. You can actually observe this in [the console tab](https://i.imgur.com/TsCUSOt.png) and [the network tab](https://i.imgur.com/u04I4IG.png) in your browser. The request is outright blocked and prevented from even happening.

[The browser doesn't even gets to make a DNS lookup at all](https://i.imgur.com/xGGigsz.png), otherwise there would be a `p.imgur.com` in the cache now. It's actually important for it to be this way, otherwise I could still communicate somewhat with an ad-server by making requests to dynamically generated DNS names that are essentially the base64 data of what I want to send to the ad-server. While this communication method is largely unidirectional, it would still allow for limited tracking of the user.",best adblocker extension

32029,"I was going to say the Four Seasons in Budapest. The building itself is a work of art, and I'm a big fan of art nouveau in general but the building was on a whole level of it's own in terms of artistry and quality.
The rooms were spacious and had ~12' ceilings (I'm not great at estimating height but they seemed higher than what most people call ""high ceilings""). Each room had it's own doorbell which was novel.
 And the rooms looked over the Danube onto the other side of the city with the castle and historical district. My aunt's room had a balcony with the view and my room had a wide stone ""windowsill"" with windows that opened like French doors so I could sit on the windowsill while admiring the view.",best hotel to live in
