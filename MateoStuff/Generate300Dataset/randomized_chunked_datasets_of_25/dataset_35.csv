The enjoyment comes only when you're a fan of long, staring-out-the-window-on-a-rainy-day reflection between chapters (sometimes even between paragraphs).  You have to enjoy exegesis to truly find joy in the reading experience; the story is more staggering and emotional the more the reader is inclined to these kinds of habits. But people read for different reasons and people internalize stories different ways so it's just not for everyone.  Glad someone read it and found it interesting, though!",best science fiction novel

65665,"My girlfriend has Sprint and I've had Verizon and AT&T.

Sprint is awful for internet.  Phone coverage is pretty bad also.

Verizon is good for the most part but there are a bunch of weird dead zones, including anywhere on the beach.  4G availability is decent but not great.

AT&T has by far the best coverage, both phone and internet, in my experience.  If you're scared of their customer service, note that Verizon is no better.  Verizon is also more expensive than AT&T by a small amount.

Note that most of my experience is from the south bay so if you're not from here, ymmv.",best phone service company

16592,"Yep!!! I never had rats as a pet. I did work with them when I worked at a pet store.  Thereâ€™s some rats that are amazingly gentle and awesome.  

Look for Rat rescues and youâ€™ll get to see various rats (instead of pet store rats as 90% are used as snake food vs pets), and the rescuers will pick out the ones that are more hardly for kids.   Let your son choose and decide.  

Mice are nice, but too small and can be a little too quick.  

Guinea pigs are awesome, but you need to have two since theyâ€™re social animals.  They do make a lot of noise though. 

Small mammals, birds, sugar gliders, chinchillas are a no IMO as they all are more delicate.
