"Have a look at Superlux - They make REALLY good headphones, that cost next to nothing.

EDIT: [Thomann.de](http://www.thomann.de/gb/superlux_headphones.html) has them. I assume you're in the UK?"
"Bash does most jobs well enough, but I like the dual panes of mc for comparing directories or moving select files from one to the other. You can also configure mc to open files using a default program, which is nice."
Gilmore Girls.
I suggest AirBac backpacks.
"Yes, I'm just eating breakfast. Fortunately I didn't have to wake up at an ungodly hour today to deal with bullshit at work, but I have my first conference call of the day in a few minutes. Markets are up today so hopefully the meeting isn't all that stressful.

I think this is the least paradise-like a 'vacation' in paradise can be..."
All of Kanye
Yes!
"You beat me to it! Why on Earth, with so many choices..."
"Ive first bought a G7, returned it twice and therefore was able to test 3 different units. Wasn’t happy. Like... something did make me unhappy with the monitor. I think it was a combination of its sheer bulkyness, weird BLB, poor viewing angles (I am used to 2013 MacBook Pro IPS) and the RGB features of ALL the Units making weird, very-high pitched noises. Returned the last one too and got the MSI. I am really happy. Yes there’s glow but tbh? I am loving it. It has great blacks! Like, for real. And the unhappiness I’ve had with the G7 is nowhere to be found . I’ve got so much desk space and the viewing angles don’t remind me every minute about having to sit DEAD CENTER in order to not be distracted by weird discolorations. And it’s whisper quiet. And 2xHDMI. Really man. Try it out. And compared to the LG and Dell (which are basically the same monitor) its just better. At least that’s what the reviews say.

Edit: typos and grammar"
"Whiskey sour.  Equal parts whiskey, lemon juice and simple syrup. Tastes like lemonade. Or in the summer some whiskey in lemonade is great."
They even struggle in Serie A too
Oh yeah i finished it like 2 weeks ago then i marathoned blue exorcist last weekend and now im on physcopass season 2 then highschool dxd 2
"Believe it or not Rush Limbaugh is one hell of a guy.  He’s the most successful troll I can think of, is incredible witty and tips in hundred dollar bills."
"Write down the best day with your dad or the best thing he taught you. Put it with a picture of you and him. Doesn't cost much or anything if you have the paper and picture, but it's priceless if you're a parent."
Superdry backpacks are bae. Check them out they are really good. I sport a montana model myself
"When I wanted something glass for making cold brew coffee, I ended up getting Pyrex Erlenmeyer flasks and brewer's corks"
Box whites.

Edit: wow lots of advice from you guys, thanks I really appreciate,"
This is wonderful. The best one in the whole thread.
This is just dumb.
"When I was looking them up I ran across this chart showing their market share vs competitors increased quite a bit from 2019 through 2020.

[https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/how-coupang-is-out-amazoning-even-amazon-according-to-goodwater-capital/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/how-coupang-is-out-amazoning-even-amazon-according-to-goodwater-capital/)

All the others were major ones were flat or had minor declines, whiles Coupang saw a 6% increase. 

There is a good chance this chart isn't showing the full picture (most people cherry pick data), but I've only heard great things and have seen some positive metrics. Coupled with their share price steady decline the last few months, I finally think it might be a good time to get in.

Not saying competition won't step up and they won't have more hurdles, but haven't seen *too many* red flags to stop me from initiating a position."
"Everyman Jack used to make a Cedarwood soap that was sold at Target. That's my personal favorite. They now only sell the body wash at my local store, which doesn't have the same lasting smell as bar soaps. So I've been purchasing from Amazon lately. Plantlife Cedarwood bar barely smells like Cedarwood, and it's a very small unmanly bar. I wouldn't recommend it. Mistral Cedarwood Marine is really nice for the price, costs me about $10 every 45 days. That's what I currently use. My current girlfriend really enjoys it. They also make a Sandlewood bar that I switch up depending on my mood."
"Ladies... get a shower stool. I have a teak Japanese style one.. Shaving is infinitely easier without having to do shower yoga. Also, I no longer almost fall and die while switching legs. And it's easier to dissociate under the water.

Edit: dissociate vs disassociate"
Is that the metric they’re using? That’s not a measure of quality.
