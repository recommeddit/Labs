30964,best country to live in,The Us
7668,best laptop for general use,"That's a solid gaming device, but I really don't think that it is worth spending more for. You end up paying quite a lot just to get a dedicated GPU that you won't be using."
32600,best vacation resort,"Jade Mountain is an incredible resort. If you want a bit of mountains and a bit of beach, add on Sugar Beach. 10/10"

36104,best alcoholic drink,"Holy shit, so that's where it came from.  Thats what we always called it as kids when we'd go up to a soda machine and get some of everything in our drinks.  Never knew why it was called that, but it makes more sense now."
7090,best iPhone,"I think more importantly for the Telephoto would be night mode, and also they should have night mode on the XS models.. but that would get less people to upgrade.

I'm guessing they don't allow RAW on the ultrawide because they want to be the ones to do the distortion correction.

Although I shoot all the images in RAW+JPG on my android, I don't edit them as much as I do with my Mirrorless, but it is nice to know that I can fix things in post if it is an important photo. Also, I guess it is nice that an Android RAW isn't really the same as a standard RAW because it still uses the HDR+ median blend image (smart HDR on Apple) and gives you that without the extra corrections to color / noise / sharpness."
11972,best gifts for dad,To be left alone. If my wife took my kids out for the day that would be awesome. I love them all dearly but a day of me time without being asked to do shit for everyone else would be fabulous. It turns into a day where I have to do shit I don't want to do because everyone else has their own ideas about what fathers day should be.
