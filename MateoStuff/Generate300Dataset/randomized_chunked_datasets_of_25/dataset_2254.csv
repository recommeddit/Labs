58067,best cologne,"I’m working through a bottle of Eros. I still have mixed feelings about it. 

It’s definitely a loud scent, like anything Versace, people will notice it right away. Good or bad you will get a reaction. 

I like the scent but I’m not always in the mood for how bombastic it is. I don’t think it’s for everyone or all the time."
16354,best sunglasses for fashion,"The problem is that, with Ray Ban for example, they *literally were gas station sunglasses* before Luxottica bought them. Then Luxottica both raised the price and dropped the quality when they acquired the brand (changing the 5-barrel hinge for 3 barrel, for example). Similar deal with Oakley, the quality dropped significantly following acquisition by Luxoticca. 

Independent sunglass manufacturers that charge similar or greater prices are generally much better quality in terms of construction and materials than Luxoticca.

I find it much more silly when people think they're rebelling against Luxoticca by going to Warby Parker/Spec Savers etc. which tend to be even worse."

26653,best board games,"I feel like most of these lists are full of entry level tripe you'll play a few times and become bored with it.  Those aren't games you should own.  Those are games you want your friends or a board game club/cafe to buy.  If you're going to own a game make sure it's both deep and wide in strategy.  You want to be able to play the game over and over without getting tired of it.  The following games are all my favorites that will never leave my collection:



1. **Twilight Struggle** - the best 2 player game around.  You can play it hundreds of times and still get crushed by a pro player.  Enough luck to keep it exciting, plus tons of history learned

2. **Twilight Imperium 4** - the best 6 player conquer the universe game in existence.  Who doesn't want to smack talk with their friend for 4-10 hours.  New edition really makes the game great out of the box.

3. **Blood Rage** - the best 90 minute dudes on a map game.  Lots of replay-ability due to different combos.  Could also own Chaos in the Old World or the expensive Cthulu Wars.  This captures that spirit of game the best in the shortest play time.

4.  **Rune Wars** - if you only have 3 or 4 players this beats Ti4 for the epic game to play.  Simply the best fantasy epic game in existence.

5. **Star Wars Rebellion** w/expansion - base game was really good combat was dry.  With the expansion this is my favorite long game for 2.  Tons of choices and great Star Wars theme.

6. **Eldritch Horror** + one expansion - the base game's adventure and clue decks were too small you'd see the same card two or three times a game.  One expansion fixes all that.  This is the best coop game that isn't Pandemic.  I like it better for it's theme, luck, and mood.

7. **Three Kindoms Redux** - this is one of the best worker placement game I've played.  Only downfall is you need 3 players no less no more every time.  Great theme, wide and deep decision space.

8. **Dominant Species** - this is the king of worker placement and area control games in my book.  It should only be played with 6 players (though it works 3-6).  Feels great, tough, tough, decisions to be made each turn.  Swingy but you're never out of contention.

9. **Agricola** - this is the stress fest that makes the worker placement mechanism shine.  Why'd you take that space now Johnny is going to starve this winter!!!  

10. **Great Western Trial** - this could be replaced by Kanban or Panamax or Mediera or any other medium heavy euro.  These games are great but limited replays limits how much value you get out of them.  Perhaps I should have ended my list at 9."
38322,best newspapers to read,SCMP is still pretty decent for Asia news. The investment by Alibaba is concerning - and there has been a slight pro-mainland shift in the Hong Kong-related opeds since then - but the news content is still quite reputable

Serious, this has the best replay value of them all.   Plus you can play it in 3D."

71359,best movies with a cool twist,"That's great and all but he also looks at people the whole damn movie. The director probably told him something like ""you're blind but don't make it obvious"". He keeps looking at other people's faces, he looks at his own reflection in a cup of water for crying out loud. And it's all misdirection."
14848,best romantic novel,Not sure.  It’s definitely enjoyable and well-liked (I liked it!) but I figured it would fall toward the middle.
