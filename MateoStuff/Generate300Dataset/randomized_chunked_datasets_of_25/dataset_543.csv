22609,"I saw Laurence Fishburne outside of a grocery store. I'm a fan so I speak up and politely say ""Mr. Fishburne."" He SPINS around while kinda grunt/yelling ""What?!?"" I instantly regretted my decision to speak but I had to say something so follow through and  meekly say ""I really love your work, sir.""

He smiles the biggest smile and says ""I really appreciate that, thanks for watching"" and was absolutely as nice as could be.

There are tons of lovely German-run bed and breakfasts all over Mexico. They often operate by word of mouth and website/email, so expect to look a bit harder, but they're inexpensive, generally excellently maintained, full of interesting European guests, and very plugged in to the local scene. No food poisoning in the buffet (a buffet? Oh god how does that possibly work in a sub tropical climate with minimal knowledge of food service hygiene?) Good wifi and lots of hot water. I've always had much better experiences outside of the big hotels. As someone mentioned before, the staff do not give a fuck about individual guests, even if you tip well. Granted I've never been to Cabo, but in Huatulco and Veracruz this held true.",best vacation resort

15841,"I would bet all the money in my wallet that it's not anyone Asian down-voting me, it's the absolute worst kind of white person there is. They think any talking about race is racist. They're the kinds of people who get mad when you say the word Mexican, and it's like hey pendejo, Hispanic doesn't mean Mexican, Mexican means I'm from Mexico.
