37363,best amusement park,"It's a very close call between SFFT, SSA, and SFOT."
22609,best celebrity,"I saw Laurence Fishburne outside of a grocery store. I'm a fan so I speak up and politely say ""Mr. Fishburne."" He SPINS around while kinda grunt/yelling ""What?!?"" I instantly regretted my decision to speak but I had to say something so follow through and  meekly say ""I really love your work, sir.""

He smiles the biggest smile and says ""I really appreciate that, thanks for watching"" and was absolutely as nice as could be. 

But in those seconds between responses, the thought crossed my mind that I was about to catch an Ike vs Tina Turner style beating."
36603,best alcoholic drink,Apple cider

32221,best hotel to live in,"Lol, the way they ask ‚ÄúShaq?‚Äù makes me imagine that Shaq‚Äôs an old buddy of theirs and they just realized they were talking to their homie, in a ‚ÄúSh... Shaq? That you, man?‚Äù kinda way."
67409,axios alternatives reddit,I like request because it interfaces well with streams. Otherwise I use request-promise if I don't need streams.
57581,best cologne,"I have never worn cologne before. How do you usually apply it to yourself?

1-2 sprays how far away from body? what areas ect."
33265,best electric car,"Vehicle batteries can support a lot for a long time. I can run my house for a week off a Lightning. 

I see this as the killer app for BEV adoption. I don't see a reason not to want it. It's going to become a baseline expectation of new EVs."
17316,best iOS game,"No, without third-party app"
30243,best Mexican war to study,"I don‚Äôt remember learning about it in school. However as an adult homeschooling my son we learned about it and found this song.

[Saint Patrick‚Äôs Battalion ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1JwjceS5HLg)"
66459,best soccer team in the world,Afcon semis and recent world cup group
66225,best soccer team in the world,how high do you think they should be?
32511,best vacation resort,"I know you said all inclusive, but...
There are tons of lovely German-run bed and breakfasts all over Mexico. They often operate by word of mouth and website/email, so expect to look a bit harder, but they're inexpensive, generally excellently maintained, full of interesting European guests, and very plugged in to the local scene. No food poisoning in the buffet (a buffet? Oh god how does that possibly work in a sub tropical climate with minimal knowledge of food service hygiene?) Good wifi and lots of hot water. I've always had much better experiences outside of the big hotels. As someone mentioned before, the staff do not give a fuck about individual guests, even if you tip well. Granted I've never been to Cabo, but in Huatulco and Veracruz this held true."
2995,best webcamera,"Precisely, 720p is fine, but I has to be a *good* 720p. Doesn't matter how sharp it is if the image still looks like shit."

72227,best adblocker extension,"[uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en).  Is much more [resource friendly than Adblock Plus](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared).  

Adblock has an ""Acceptable Ads"" program, which lets advertisers pay Adblock to allow adverts though: [Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are paying Adblock Plus huge fees to get their ads unblocked](http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-amazon-taboola-pay-adblock-plus-to-stop-blocking-their-ads-2015-2?r=US&IR=T) (that was in Feb 2015, and I'm sure others are paying now)."
15841,best sunglasses for fashion,"I would bet all the money in my wallet that it's not anyone Asian down-voting me, it's the absolute worst kind of white person there is. They think any talking about race is racist. They're the kinds of people who get mad when you say the word Mexican, and it's like hey pendejo, Hispanic doesn't mean Mexican, Mexican means I'm from Mexico.  
 
But anyway yeah, people are different and fashion is big in Asia especially tech wear/street wear so you see companies like Oakley making stuff to fit smaller framed/different shaped people and that's a GOOD thing."
8356,best toothpaste,"Not really sure what indenture sticks are, but they might've meant interdental sticks."
