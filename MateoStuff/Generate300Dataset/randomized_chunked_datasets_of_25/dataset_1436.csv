3575,"YouTube, looking at Google images of the school/campus/area, reading through their subreddit, asking questions on their subreddit, etc. helps a lot. Also, googling ‚ÄúIs ____ university a good school?‚Äù will lead to Quora pages about the school and it will tell you a ton of info about whichever school you are looking in to. Once you find a quora post about your school, scroll down and find the ‚Äúrecommended/related posts‚Äù links and just keep finding questions/posts about your school. They typically have long answers and the recommended post links are really useful because they usually bring up different aspects of the school.

Note that Quora and college confidential posts can be quite outdated, but anything general (buildings, locations, vibes, facilities) written within 4-5 years usually remains the same.

Those ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù vlogs with 1 million+ views can be an exaggerated view of the school and sometimes only highlight the benefits/positive aspects of the school. Try to find some honest and genuine people who make videos on the schools and have realistic views. People who mention the cons of a school are usually going to give you the best perspective.

Dorm move in videos can be decent at showing the campus and move in day, but a lot of people exaggerate the vlogs and have a fake personality. The videos with a chill person sitting in front of the camera and listing stuff about the school is usually going to be more real with you and generally have better info.

Good luck!",best college for research

58977,"Oooh fantastic! This is difficult as my collection is now nearing the 100 bottle mark I think... But, in no particular order:

* I: **Amouage, Overture Man** This is simply one of my favourites full stop. Classy, boozy, seductive, basically confidence in a bottle. 

* II: **Tom Ford, Tobacco Oud Intense** My first proper foray into oud and tobacco and it was love at first sniff. Rough around the edges but exquisite in its overall composure. 

* III: **UNUM, Lavs** Must be pre-reformulation with the transparent side glass and lovely black and gold colouring. This, to me, is the pope smoking a cigar. It is incense, burning, and some layer of smoke too. This simply is the greatest scent (to me) I have ever smelled. 

* IV: **Xerjoff, Naxos** Again, love at first sniff. This is basically now my signature scent and I adore it. Sweet, sticky honey with a heavy dose of wet tobacco leaf. This is basically sex in a bottle. 

* V: **Initio, Oud for Greatness** I have samples of BR540, and a bottle of this, and as much as I might be shot for this opinion, to my nose OFG is basically a more masculine version of BR540. The best thing is my FWB enjoys wearing my BR540 samples, and I enjoy OFG, so we make a ridiculously good smelling pair. 

* VI: **Parfums de Marly, Carlisle** Now, I wanted to put Herod here instead but having a hard think, I would go Carlisle just for the difference. Carlisle, to me, is the bastard love child of Herod and Layton. The apple, woods, vanilla, tobacco(maybe?) scent is lovely, and it performs like a beast on me. So for the difference, PDM Carlisle it is. 

* VII and VIII: **Creed, Viking/Green Irish Tweed** Two for one here I guess... Viking and Green Irish Tweed are my two favourite Creeds and both match different day types to me. Green Irish is fresh, warm, sunny spring whereas Viking suits drizzly spring (needless to say my Viking bottle has been used a lot more here in the UK than GIT). But both are spectacular scents and feel upper class and gentlemanly. Suits my lecturer look and profession I guess. 

* IX: **Armani Priv√®, Bois D'Encens** This is a deep, dark, resinous incense and is probably my favourite out of my vast collection. The darkness in this is surpassed by Heeley's Eau Sacr√®e, but I feel APBD'E is far more wearable and is much more akin to the type of incense I really enjoy. 

* X: **Amouage, Interlude Man** The Blue Beast which sent me down the rabbit hole of niche fragrances. Since Amouage is my favourite house I don't think I could ever be without this!",best perfume

Npp is what I use if what I really want is a text editor.  The others are for more involved development processes:

* PhpStorm for development/debugging in PHP
* VS Code for development/debugging of Node.js applications
