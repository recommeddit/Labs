54328,best medicine for a cold,"Western medicine is designed to treat symptoms. Mucinex keeps you from feeling mucus buildup. Tylenol reduces your fever. None of these name brand medicines actually improve your overall health.

These home remedies allow your body to purge toxins. Sometimes, by eating the right things and avoiding putting more chemicals in your body, you will feel worse before you feel better. You may have so many toxins in you that it hurts you, at first, to get rid of them (ex: ppl quit cigarettes, then get very sick).

Our OTC medicine is not making our bodies healthier. It is only blocking the symptoms.

Try the home remedies. They are better for you."

86,best terminal file manager reddit,"in program help key - isn't `?` working for you?

latest version shows the selected files with a `+` before them.

multi-select key is `^Y`.

Context use clues: every help string needs memory to store, in addition, to show the help in a new window, each time we will have to draw it, show and then remove it and adjust the window below it as well. The keystrokes in `nnn` are far simpler than those in `vim` and far less as well. I think going for this kind of a program help mechanism would be a overkill."

5388,best home improvement store,"Loving these suggestions! I have recently learned of a Habitat ReStore. It’s like a goodwill for stuff that I typically find absurdly expensive and overpriced, and don’t care if it’s new or not: doors, ceiling fans, tools, lumber, etc. We just had a baby and it was a relief to find out about this place, so we could continue with some unexpected improvements, without spending a fortune. 

So, since I’ll be using these links, adding my two cents on this brick and mortar gem (depending on where you live). Habitat for Humanity ReStore."
