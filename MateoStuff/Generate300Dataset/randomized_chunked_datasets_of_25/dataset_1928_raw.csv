"This has been on my watchlist for years. I know nothing about it, I will make a point of watching it this week."
"Midnight Marauders by Tribe it surpassed a classic, namely Low End Theory and started a second rap renaissance."
"Basic:
1. Best album for me is Flu Game by AJ Tracey. Very good flow from him, really good beats, and whole project is very consistent
2. Best beats must be Lay With Ya from Rashad(this beat is insane) and What You Need from Don also Calling My Phone from Lil Tjay
3. Best features are from Offset on Shoot my Shoot from IDK and Run It Up from Lil Tjay
4. This is hard to decide for me
5. Definetly What You Need and His & Hers from Don. His voice is insane 

Fun ones:
1. Best cover arts are from iivrson(i love this roses theme, looking clean) and Sleepy Hallow(good design, and colours)
2. Dj Khaled album is worst album of this year so far, generic af beats, it has so much good names but Khaled can’t use it for good. But i gotta admit i love Popstar with Drake. The rest of the songs are boring 
3. It must be $avvy. He made album in this year „Boys Wears Pearls” and he create so much catchy music. It is shocking for me he only have 700 listeners this month. If you like melodic rap i reccomend to check his last album
4. 24kgldn. He creates very catchy songs, very easy listen for me, chill vibes. I like how he mix rap with pop
5. Flu Game from AJ Tracey. It has a lot of good, high energy songs, melodic songs. It has good production, feats, and Tracey is really a solid rapper"
"Once enamel is damaged to a certain point, it cannot be “repaired”.
Very early breakdown of enamel can be remineralized and the damaging process can cease.  Once a cavity reaches the dentin or middle layer of the tooth, it cannot be repaired by any toothpaste or topical remedy.  Sensodyne isn’t special.  It’s just another brand name.  It does contain an additional ingredient called potassium nitrate, which is an excellent desensitizer for minor root exposure and cold sensitivity.  Any toothpaste brand can say it desensitizes because technically fluoride is a desensitizer. However, only prescription fluoride is truly effective for desensitizing. But the potassium nitrate added to the formula boosts the desensitizing effectiveness.  So, if a toothpaste advertise that it is for sensitive teeth, turn the box over and read the active ingredients.  If potassium nitrate isn’t listed, you are just buying pain fluoridated toothpaste.
No, discoloration can only be fixed with bleaching or major dental work."
"I'm currently working in Saudi Arabia and running my science experiment through my Brita definitely makes my project much nicer. I'm trying out a combination of mixing juice, sugar and/or honey and wine yeast."
That's why it isn't for everyone. You have to be really self motivated and manage your school work schedule all on your own.

Holy shit."
Nah fam how can someone NOT appreciate the albums that changed Hip Hop into its Golden Age? That does not make sense to me.
That Chicken Dinner and Knott's Berry Punch make Knott's worth visiting for me. Their food is up there with Dollywood and Silver Dollar City for me as the best theme park food. It's definitely a step above the stuff you get at your typical Six Flags or Cedar Fair park.
"Well let me reframe the question because that's not at all what I said. A few players who IMO should not be ranked over every Bills player include Eric Kendricks, Allen Robinson, and AJ Brown. Not that it matters."
I wish I didn’t listen to people who said you can’t make money being an artist and went to art school instead
"""Undefeated"" seems to have slipped a lot of people's radars. every theme from every great sports movie ever, except real. won the oscar for best documentary feature 2011, so i'm even more surprised not to see it listed here yet."
"Sennheiser HD 280 pro

 I had my first pair for 7 years. I got the same exact model when those broke down, as in the aux plug got bent. Little did I know before I ordered my new pair that they were actually designed to be fixed if need be. They are super durable, comfortable, great natural outside noise insulator (I rarely have volume set to over 30%), they're like x-ray vision in video games like CS:GO, friends have reported hearing things in songs they've never heard before. They're studio headphones so you don't get added bass (which I prefer) and the cable can be ornery but they are excellent and sound like $250+ phones for $100. They last and last and last!"
"You can also go for clones of more expensive fragrances
-cuba gold is the clone of le male by john paul gaultier which is a pretty popular clubbing fragrance and lasts pretty long. I cant really discern the differences between them. runs around $10 dollars on amazon for a 3.4oz.

- cuba prestige is a nice clone of the original A*Men, around $12 dollars for 3.4oz and I got mine from Ross.

-Perry Ellis 360 Red is pretty popular and kinda resembles Acqua di gio, one of the top selling fragrances of the past. It is more of a spicy sporty smell to it. Around 17 bucks for a 1.7oz bottle from Ross.

-Curve and Curve Black (a darker woodsier scent than the sweet original curve) runs between $15-20 dollars at TJ Maxx or Ross for 4oz bottle. I find that a lot of girls like this scent a lot and it lasts pretty well for around 6 hrs on me. Its more of an everyday scent that I use.

-Can't go wrong with Nautica Voyage, as it is hugely popular with the fragrance community for its clean aquatic scent. It runs around $15 dollars online or on fragrancenet.com (i highly recommend shopping here for legitimate bottles to avoid scams or fakes on ebay). I would stay away from nautica blue, it doesn't last longer than 2-3 hours. Don't bother with the other nautica scents, I have a few and I can say they aren't worth the few dollars they cost.

-For a more mature and good manly evening date scent, or even for cold winter days, you can try F Black by Ferragamo. It is a peppery dark scent, and lasts VERY long. One or two sprays is enough for a whole night. I wouldn't recommend this as a day scent since its kinds strong. You can get a tester bottle from Fragrancenet.com for around 18-22 bucks for a 3.4oz. Don't worry about tester bottles, they are the real deal and are brand new, they just come in a cardboard box and without the fancy cap that doesn't do anything.

Another everyday cheap scent I like is a celebrity cologne by Adam Levine. It doesn't smell great on everyone but it happens to do well on my skin. It is also fairly cheap. http://www.fragrancenet.com/cologne/adam-levine/adam-levine/edt#238320"

Which Crimeapple project is your favorite so far? It’s a toss up between Wet Dirt and Aguardiente for me.
