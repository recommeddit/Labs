69798,"Best advice I can give is find a job (or field) that you think you'll enjoy and excel at, then work backwards from there. Once you have an endpoint, think of the degree that will best get you there. 

The type of degree obviously matters but you also have to consider your interests. If you don't enjoy programming you probably won't be very successful with a computer science degree, or you'll end up hating your job which will make the marginal difference in salary not worth it.",best major to study in college

50746,"1. Haram, been big on Armand hammer for 2 years and this was just perfect for me. I like the fat ray album same with Mach Hommy even though I never really got into them before. Tony Allen’s album too I like a lot. 

2. As a beat album moderators Midnight Madness, as one rap beat I will probably pick Tony Allen deer in headlights.

3. Jid. Anytime he features I feel he brings a show. Also I gotta say I like when the bruiser brigade feature on each other’s songs they are always my favorite just the way they mesh with each other. 

4. Billy woods all over Haram. If I were to pick on probably Robert Moses or scaffolds

5. Middle men on dope game stupid. I know there are probably better ones but it gets stuck in my head a lot. 

Gotta say most slept on album is probably the Tony Allen one for me. I never see any discussions about it but the drum beats are my favorite shit and he’s got good rappers with good songs all over it. 

Shouts out Genesis Owusu, and Sons of Kemet they get a lot of plays from me too",best rap album
