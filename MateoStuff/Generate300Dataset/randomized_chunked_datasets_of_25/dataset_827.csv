71852,best movies with a cool twist,"Although iirc that was pure coincide. The sith lord names are based of traits shown by the sith lord themself, with Vader for invader, Sidious for insidious, Plagueis for Plague, and so on. It meaning father in Dutch was not planned."
12385,best gifts for mom,"My mother loves perfume. Sometimes not even to wear, she just likes having scents at hand. Smells that remind her of childhood, smells that remind her of sunny days. 

I work for a company that has a very large line of naturally sourced perfumes. Over the previous year I stockpiled every free type I got - solid perfumes, spray bottles, dropper bottles - and sent around thirty to her in one go. She was over the moon. I get messages nearly monthly about new aspects she noticed in their scent, or what she now associates them with."

69311,best major to study in college,"My first job was a systems engineer, Firaxis Software was on one of the floors above us. Let me tell you I got jealous quickly at the pallets of soda getting carted up, people showing up to interviews in jeans, and people drinking beer in the elevator on Friday. I envy the corporate culture of the CS people."
23758,best car racing video game,Mario Kart 8. Most PC sims are way too serious for me to get into.
58416,best cologne,"I eat very unhealthy ... And I've found woman like my sweat smell. 

In high school and Uni after hockey practice before getting a chance to hit the shower I'd  always get stopped by friends. 

It took a while to realize, but it eventually became evident that my female friends would act more flirty.. Not all of them, but a good portion. 

Like I said the correlation between me being sweaty and flirty friends took a while to figure out, as you can imagine. 

I'm not sure nutrition has anything to do with this since again, I eat pretty piss more foods."
57218,best water brand,Microplastics is also a common occurrence and cause for worry in plastic bottled water.
52300,best hiphop album,"Yeah I get what you're saying, on rateyourmusic they don't really take that into account though. It's not that they misunderstand hiphop or anything, but regardless of genre most users take each album by itself disregarding anything other than just music, lyrics, production and the albums' presentation. Since users still rate albums from now, to gauge an album on it's influence would create a bias (and there is already a lot of those on there)"

1605,best ice cream flavor,"Have also really enjoyed Star Anise ice cream, but don't consider that quite as strange."
68426,best science fiction novel,"I haven’t read anything post apocalyptic that approaches Canticle—maybe because, like LOTR did with fantasy, it so defined the genre for a while that everything else seemed derivative. Really, only The Road seems to approach its feeling of spiritual precipice.  So much of the rest just iterates survival strategies, or cool postmodern steampunk sex."
38163,best Marvel movie,"I agree. I'm not a huge MCU fan, but the portals at the end (I don't think that's a spoiler) was the most goosebumps moment I've ever had in a theater."
