12385,"My mother loves perfume. Sometimes not even to wear, she just likes having scents at hand. Smells that remind her of childhood, smells that remind her of sunny days. 

I work for a company that has a very large line of naturally sourced perfumes. Over the previous year I stockpiled every free type I got - solid perfumes, spray bottles, dropper bottles - and sent around thirty to her in one go. She was over the moon. I get messages nearly monthly about new aspects she noticed in their scent, or what she now associates them with.",best gifts for mom

It took a while to realize, but it eventually became evident that my female friends would act more flirty.. Not all of them, but a good portion. 

Like I said the correlation between me being sweaty and flirty friends took a while to figure out, as you can imagine.

It's not that they misunderstand hiphop or anything, but regardless of genre most users take each album by itself disregarding anything other than just music, lyrics, production and the albums' presentation.
