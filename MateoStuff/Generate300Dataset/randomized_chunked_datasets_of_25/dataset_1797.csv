54447,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Dpi is 800 and my valorant sens is 0.32, csgo is 1.00. I use a handful of mice on rotation an rotate through all five artisans. So lots of combinations! Keeps it exciting and new!

Favorite mass market pad.. Hmm does aqua control plus count? I honestly don't know... What qualifies a pad as mass market? Logi and razer pads?"
40913,best instrument to play,"The easy part of playing the piano is also the hard part of piano playing. Technically, there are only two things you can do to control the sound: that single moment of pushing the key down to start the note and that other single moment of letting the damper fall to stop the same note. That’s it. In between those two moments, the note decays on its own without any of your control. So, all forms of musicality must be simulated via those two means alone.

That’s when piano becomes difficult to master."
12452,best gifts for mom,"An out of print picture book we used to borrow from the library all the time when my siblings and I were little. At the time I purchased it, it was really difficult to find. She always said it was her very favorite picture book and I thought it was crazy we didn't have our own copy. I finally found it online and she was SO excited when she opened it. Did not expect it at all. She doesn't even keep it on the regular bookshelf because she wants it to stay in good condition out of the hands of the little ones now lol."

14685,best romantic novel,"Lolita is an unparalleled masterpiece, but unless you're talking about Humbert's relationship with Humbert, I wouldn't go all Vanity Fair on its ass."
59942,best perfume,I love Covet.
72525,best keyboard switches,"I've been on blues for a couple years and have no problem with adadada strafing or repeating key presses rapidly. You grow accustomed to the force and the activation threshold so it becomes a non-issue. O-rings are also pretty useful for reducing the distance your keys travel, and depending on hardness they'll dampen some click in clicky switches. Those problems become more apparent coming off reds or browns than anything else I think. I can't stand reds or browns though. The click on the browns feel like broken blues, and I just end up pressing too many wrong random keys with reds. The required force on both of them is too small and I can't even tell I've pressed them, especially wearing headphones. 
If I had to pick a linear switch I'd go for black because it requires even more force than blues. 

And if I wanted the world to hate me, greens ;)."

71289,best movies with a cool twist,"The Skeleton Key is one of my favorite movies still to this day! I really love the southern gothic vibe it had going on. I can't help but notice while watching Get Out (which I also liked), they had a *lot* of similarities or if that was just me."
69444,best major to study in college,"The average person doesn't have connections that will make them effortlessly rich. This is just something that people say because they want to feel like victims while refusing to work hard themselves.

Don't get me wrong. Life isn't always fair. In fact, life is extremely unfair. But if you go to college, pick a somewhat useful major, and work 12 hours a day (outside of class) in order to graduate with a 3.9 GPA, you will be fine in life. The average person just doesn't want to put in that kind of work. We think that we're entitled to a job after college simply because we graduated. People take classes and memorize whatever the professor is rambling about rather than reading the books carefully, looking deeper into the topics, trying to find internships to put those skills into action, etc. 

Don't get me wrong... Are there people out there that abuse family connections to make themselves rich, even though they're pretty dumb? Sure. But this isn't even close to being the norm. This is just a cop-out.

One last thing. No, you're not ""secretly incredibly intelligent, but just really lazy so you're not working to your full potential."" If you were as smart as you say you are, you'd work harder."
