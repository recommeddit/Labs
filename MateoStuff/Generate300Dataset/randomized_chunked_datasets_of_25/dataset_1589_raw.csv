FHD?
"I put off buying a whet stone for a long time, mostly because i was nervous i would use it wrong and ruin my knifes, but its not too hard at all if you get one with an angle guide. Makes chopping stuff up faster, easier & safer"
I was specifically thinking of ibuprofen and acetaminophen for when the pain is just still there!
"Sounds like it would be great to sleep in though!

Our bedroom gets facefucked by the sun at 5am"
"Do your textbooks ever talk about the Tejanos and Californios?

We wouldn't have been able to hold California without the indifference of the local population. We didn't have the supply lines the Mexican government did."
Yeah no doubt. I love what he did with modern production sensibilities on KOD and kind of made them his own in a lot of ways. It's a big departure from his more typical sound and the flows show cased he has way more range than hes shown. Really well executed concept album. I'm just a sucker for  those strings and horns and all the singing/harmonies. Beautiful
"Hahaha yeah I get that. The only person I can play nightcore around is my sister and that’s only because we like to have crazy car dance parties. Personally, I love blasting it in the car, especially on long car trips!"
The first Cap is great.

"If you've got *Starship Troopers* and *The Forever War*, you might as well add *Old Man's War*."
That’s her whole personality IMO. That’s why poosh happened.
They’re gonna open it regardless. Just don’t carry drugs
What about IPVanish? There's currently a special for $48/year.
"IMHO it depends on the kids.  I've known families with breeds not normally recommended for families (Afghans, Irish Terriers, Malinois) and it worked out great because the parents were smart and dog savvy and raised nice, dog savvy kids.

And even the nicest dog can bite if the kids are allowed to run roughshod over the dog and he finally hits his limit.  I think many dogs should be put up for sainthood but it should never be allowed to get to that point."
"Get rich or die trying, it’s probably not the best, but it’s still so good"
