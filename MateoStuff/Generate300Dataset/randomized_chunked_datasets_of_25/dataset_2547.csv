72959,best Linux distro,"First off, Fedora is glorious. Second RHEL is its own thing."
30931,best country to live in,"Brit living in France here. Things are different here, but not necessarily any better than in the UK. Over time I've just swapped complaining about Britain to complaining about France. 

Frustrating complacency/stubbornness - nothing ever changes even when the system's totally broken, awful bureaucracy, everything is political, really high taxes increasing despite cuts in social services, TV is terrible, shops are shut on Sundays...

I'm in the North so the weather's still shit, but the South has it's downsides too (people are much more closed, for example; I could never make meaningful friendships with locals down there.) 

Edit: Also I disagree about leisure time. Having a longer lunch hour means finishing work later so less time for hobbies or socialising. Also sports and other clubs are always chronically underfunded and stop running during the summer."

3184,best webcamera,"I have the Cinema and Studio both as well; ended up disabling autofocus on the Cinema and adjusting it manually. Since getting the studio, I haven't noticed it doing the same thing, but I also haven't used it nearly as much. If you can get a good deal, go for the Studio"

11370,best gifts for dad,"My father passed away about 5 years ago. My mother has been hanging on to some of his possessions over the years, instead of giving them to me and my sisters. A couple months ago, my mother asks me if I want his collector beer steins, so I take the lot of them. 

As I'm washing the years of collected dust off of tops of the steins, I open one up and see a piece of paper. I soon realize that it's a picture I drew for my dad when I was young. It stated ""Happy Fathers Day"" in big (ugly) block type font, with several other tiny drawings of things he liked, like cowboy guns, and Stetson hats). 

As a man in his mid 30's, I broke down and wept like a child. I've gone through most of my dad's possessions he left behind, and I haven't found any of the other gifts I gave him throughout the years. Maybe he used them up, and wore them out. Like a shirt or hat or something. But he held of to the one drawing I gave him, for at least 25 years after I gave it to him.

**TLDR:** Make something original. The sentimental factor goes up, exponentially."

1462,best ice cream flavor,"Yeah, it's definitely not popular in the US, unfortunately. Seems to be more of a Canada/Northern Europe type of thing because I havent heard of it being widely enjoyed elsewhere. 

Hope you enjoy trying some of them out!"

46269,best trick or treating candy,">If you're up for it, give bonus candy for good jokes.

Hmmm.... I like this! I didn't realize this is part of the tradition. Sounds like a lot of fun. One of our neighbors have a Ron Paul sign in the yard. Maybe he will make the kids recite the Constitution.

Yay! I hope so. Thank you so much for all your help."

54832,best water filter,"[this](http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/bleach.asp) is the center for disease control official recipe for sanitizing solution. make sure to use the word ""drops"" conservatively because it only takes a teaspoon per gallon to turn water into cleanser. the words drops, for this conversation needs to be standardized. per this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_%28unit%29 drops can mean

48338,best color to paint with,"Benjamin Moore is the only brand of paint I will buy.

The guy who painted my house used it, and the BM dealer near me has a constant stream of professional painters passing through their doors.

He uses their oil based alkyd primer for both interior and exterior applications and latex paint.

I am very happy with how much better my paint game has become since making the switch."
32540,best vacation resort,"I went with a friend a couple years ago to cabo and stayed at the villa del palmar, we thought we had booked all inclusive and when we got there discovered we hadn't. So we paid more than expected on the room and were worried. Day 1 we took the city bus to walmart which picked up right outside. Bought all of our margarita supplies and breakfast foods. It was super cheap! Then we ate out pretty much every lunch and dinner. Spent waayyyy less money than the price of all inclusive and didn't feel weird about going into town and eating. Definitely the way to go. We ate at the office which was fun, it's right on the beach, and at an Argentinian restaurant. Still had plenty of margaritas pool side that we ordered, but they also don't care if you make your own and bring them down to the pool, as long as you don't have glass containers. The villa was not filled with 21 year olds partying and I think the Riu usually is. Good luck!"
