You know, I don't know where leopard geckos come from originally but they look a hell of a lot like your outside ones! They get bigger though, [see, my wrist for scale](http://imgur.com/NBmc29T) (I'm a lady so it's not a man wrist though). I guess mine is about 7 inches now including tail. 

The feeder crickets are small and brown--they are usually sold in three sizes (small/medium/large) based on age since hatching, so you can end up with a size up from when you bought them if they live that long. Smallest are like, 1cm which is uh... a bit less than half an inch? Really not big. Maybe they reach 2cm full grown but that is still under one inch.

I usually buy a container of 100 mediums that lasts about three weeks. Some die just because, can't really help that. I feed every few days--they don't need to eat daily--about 5-10 crickets at a time. Seems to be enough because my girl has a good fat tail. Leopards store extra fat in their tail :)

Oh and they *can* bite, sort of-they have a reflex to lunge at anything twitchy so especially when hungry you might get nommed. But it's not a strong bite, they have no teeth, and I wouldn't even call it a pinch. It can surprise you, but won't hurt and they can't hang on to you at all.",best pet for toddlers

Things are better than before with Mortal Kombat/Injustice being as good, if not better than the console versions (and Street Fighter thrown into the mix) but not having Tekken is a major bummer :(

Also a personal preferance is no WWE games. I stopped watching WWE some 10 odd years ago but the game is a totally different thing altogether and a guilty pleasure I would have loved to see on the PC.",best game console

73861,"You need tape, an exacto blade or box cutter and a metal straight edge. Basically i recreated the hinge technique that a lot of other companies use. Make sure to clean the ipad well befor you begin. First you cut the film the screen protector sits on flush with edge of the screen protector on the side with the camera cut out. You only need to cut this side as it will be the side we use to align it. Next place four pieces of tape on the back of the ipad along the top edge where the camera  is. Make sure enough tape is left off the ipad so it can wrap around to the other side. You only need maybe a half an inch. Flip the ipad over, and align the screen protector. Hold it in place as you wrap the tape around top edge securing the protector in place creating a hinge. Now slowly remove the film from the back of the protector. Leting it fall naturally. Work out as many air bubbles as you can and remove dust if you need to. Dont worry about any air bubbles you can get to. They will go away over time. I didnt believe that but its true.

24384,"To expand a bit on this I think Clannad being split into two on many lists, forums, blogs and rankings sites actually really hurts it in compilations like this.

Often times sequels aren't counted or attempts are made to merge Clannad S1 and After stories rankings to get an average, both aproaches under rating Clannad severely.

Generally it's viewed that sequels have an advantage as people who didn't like the premise drop the show in S1 and thus never rate S2. I agree with this point.

However it should really be noted that

1) After Story is actually one of the few sequels to make it into that top 15 area across sites. Most entries are single series, it just looks like there are a lot of sequels but it's basically gintama spam usually (and people just think of the whole thing as one entry and vote all the parts up). So while yes it is a sequel and in theory benefits from that, it actually out performs other sequels pretty significantly and simply being a sequel is no free pass as it's sometimes seen.

2) While most shows honestly don't vary much in content from season to season, Clannad S2 really is quite a different beast from the first. Having the pay off split, quite artifically, like this I think actually causes people to underate S1 rather than overrate After Story. I fully believe that if Clannad was simply one entry its score would practically be identical to After Story's now. Take Steins's Gate for example. A show which has a similar build up during the first half, indeed often drawing criticism for it's first half being ""slow and boring"" but yet still commands strong scores across regions. I believe if Steins gate were split like Clannad is into a part 1 and a part 2 you'd see part 1 being lower rated much like Clannad S1 is but you'd see part 2 of Steins gate command the same score as the complete Steins gate does. It's just how shows that spend a good deal of their runtime building up to things work. If the payoff is worth it everything is worth it.

So yeah I'm going off on one but I really do think Clannad's split nature actually dicks it over on compilations like this and explain why despite in many ways being arguably the most universally well rated anime accross the globe is somehow underrated on these sort of critical compilations.",best anime
