63412,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,"I love the concept of csources2, but damn that UI is a mess. maybe iâ€™m just not very smart, but i canâ€™t figure out how to do anything with it. iâ€™m also afraid of screwing up my repo lists in all of my package managers."

54969,best water filter,"you're half right. They don't do anything if you're using them on city water because city water is treated to drinking standard. However, they'll do good when you use well water instead and in places where they don't have good water system."
45298,best gaming system,"Iâ€™m a big an Xbox fan as they come, but Xbox One S really hasnâ€™t aged all that well. If youâ€™re on a seriously tight budget and there are specific Xbox-exclusive games you want to play, then sure. Otherwise itâ€™s probably not the best way to spend your gaming dollars."
16667,best pet for toddlers,"Yours are adorable!! I wish we had those in Canada.  But, winter :/

You know, I don't know where leopard geckos come from originally but they look a hell of a lot like your outside ones! They get bigger though, [see, my wrist for scale](http://imgur.com/NBmc29T) (I'm a lady so it's not a man wrist though). I guess mine is about 7 inches now including tail. 

The feeder crickets are small and brown--they are usually sold in three sizes (small/medium/large) based on age since hatching, so you can end up with a size up from when you bought them if they live that long. Smallest are like, 1cm which is uh... a bit less than half an inch? Really not big. Maybe they reach 2cm full grown but that is still under one inch.

I usually buy a container of 100 mediums that lasts about three weeks. Some die just because, can't really help that. I feed every few days--they don't need to eat daily--about 5-10 crickets at a time. Seems to be enough because my girl has a good fat tail. Leopards store extra fat in their tail :)

Oh and they *can* bite, sort of-they have a reflex to lunge at anything twitchy so especially when hungry you might get nommed. But it's not a strong bite, they have no teeth, and I wouldn't even call it a pinch. It can surprise you, but won't hurt and they can't hang on to you at all."
29604,best game console,"While I've always loved PC gaming more than console I can't help but feeling left out since we don't have many fighting titles. 

Things are better than before with Mortal Kombat/Injustice being as good, if not better than the console versions (and Street Fighter thrown into the mix) but not having Tekken is a major bummer :(

Also a personal preferance is no WWE games. I stopped watching WWE some 10 odd years ago but the game is a totally different thing altogether and a guilty pleasure I would have loved to see on the PC."

54086,best medicine for a cold,"* Try to eat mostly raw food (like fruit and vegetables).
* Hydrate yourself like an animal. Then piss like an animal.
* Get out into the sun (mostly exposed, if you can) for 10-15 minutes a day.
* Get a lot of sleep.
* Take regular showers.
* Laugh. It is known to help with sickness.
* Vitamin C, and Colloidal Silver
* Rub garlic on the bottom of your feet every 6 hours or so.
* Gargle salt water to help with sore throats.
* While Pseudoephedrin may help with getting rid of the symptoms temporarily, it will not heal your cold. The reason you are suffering symptoms is because your body is clearing itself out. If you take Pseudoephedrin to take away symptoms, your body will not heal as fast, and may get worse in the long run (depending on the dosage).
* Wash your hands and face a lot.
* Abstain from junk food."
23385,best car racing video game,You made me remember I actually have this game somewhere at home thanks :)
73861,best matte screen protector for ipad,"You need tape, an exacto blade or box cutter and a metal straight edge. Basically i recreated the hinge technique that a lot of other companies use. Make sure to clean the ipad well befor you begin. First you cut the film the screen protector sits on flush with edge of the screen protector on the side with the camera cut out. You only need to cut this side as it will be the side we use to align it. Next place four pieces of tape on the back of the ipad along the top edge where the camera  is. Make sure enough tape is left off the ipad so it can wrap around to the other side. You only need maybe a half an inch. Flip the ipad over, and align the screen protector. Hold it in place as you wrap the tape around top edge securing the protector in place creating a hinge. Now slowly remove the film from the back of the protector. Leting it fall naturally. Work out as many air bubbles as you can and remove dust if you need to. Dont worry about any air bubbles you can get to. They will go away over time. I didnt believe that but its true.

Ps. Sorry for the late response."
51419,best iphone case,"Halfway through reading this, I was about to recommend going caseless at home. You can get a feel for the phone without having to worry about destroying it. Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s how I got started going naked, but itâ€™s been a minute so Iâ€™m not entirely sure. 

Let me know what you think if you end up giving it a try! Iâ€™m always curious to hear how people feel about it ðŸ˜„"

65712,best college in california,"For an interest in computer science and possibly economics in descending order:

Public: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UCSD, Cal Poly SLO

Private: Caltech, Stanford, USC

LACs: Harvey Mudd, Pomona, Claremont McKenna

Of those, USC makes me the most leery and Caltech is by far the ""best"" of the group but is easily the most intense (including ridiculously hard to transfer into).
Really though, California has a lot of great options here."
2904,best headphones,"The K612 Pros are also fantastic and arguably better for music than the 702/712s.

And cheaper in many places!"
2471,best headphones,"Sony Dynamic Stereo Headphones, MDR-7506"
16342,best sunglasses for fashion,I like the ray ban signet
51116,best rap album,"I tend to listen a very wide range of music like Salsa, Son, Jazz, Soul, Rock, Folk, Blues, Indie... when I listen bands like The Strokes, they sound pretty plain to me, good melodies... but pretty plain... not musically great, not bad too.. so I can't understand how they are listed #3 in lists like this. Am I the only one and I need to listen them again.. or am I right ?"
24384,best anime,"To expand a bit on this I think Clannad being split into two on many lists, forums, blogs and rankings sites actually really hurts it in compilations like this.

Often times sequels aren't counted or attempts are made to merge Clannad S1 and After stories rankings to get an average, both aproaches under rating Clannad severely.

Generally it's viewed that sequels have an advantage as people who didn't like the premise drop the show in S1 and thus never rate S2. I agree with this point.

However it should really be noted that

1) After Story is actually one of the few sequels to make it into that top 15 area across sites. Most entries are single series, it just looks like there are a lot of sequels but it's basically gintama spam usually (and people just think of the whole thing as one entry and vote all the parts up). So while yes it is a sequel and in theory benefits from that, it actually out performs other sequels pretty significantly and simply being a sequel is no free pass as it's sometimes seen.

2) While most shows honestly don't vary much in content from season to season, Clannad S2 really is quite a different beast from the first. Having the pay off split, quite artifically, like this I think actually causes people to underate S1 rather than overrate After Story. I fully believe that if Clannad was simply one entry its score would practically be identical to After Story's now. Take Steins's Gate for example. A show which has a similar build up during the first half, indeed often drawing criticism for it's first half being ""slow and boring"" but yet still commands strong scores across regions. I believe if Steins gate were split like Clannad is into a part 1 and a part 2 you'd see part 1 being lower rated much like Clannad S1 is but you'd see part 2 of Steins gate command the same score as the complete Steins gate does. It's just how shows that spend a good deal of their runtime building up to things work. If the payoff is worth it everything is worth it.

So yeah I'm going off on one but I really do think Clannad's split nature actually dicks it over on compilations like this and explain why despite in many ways being arguably the most universally well rated anime accross the globe is somehow underrated on these sort of critical compilations."
