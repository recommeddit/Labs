"Ugh, so many to choose from. I find myself always gravitating towards the low carb monster. But lately I've really liked the warheads and sour patch kids Ghost drinks."
Don't hesitate to submit papers you find interesting!
"the 'low light setting"" on the c922 makes it look much better then the c920 for people that dont use professional lighting setups. Also its usually on sale for 50(black friday)-75 dollars. I upgraded from the c920 to the c922 and never looked back. The Personify Chroma cam thing is garbage though and wont use it."

"You can send it to the company with a nice note; they'll probably either repair or replace it. It will cost you the cost of shipping it to them (in the US.)

Mine had some rips, one area it had worn through the fabric, and was generally a (still beloved) mess. They replaced the straps, patched the worn area, replaced the long-since torn mesh with a more durable cloth, and cleaned it. It's beautiful again!"
This a thousand times!!
"A++++, very down-to-earth, would meet again"
"Every three months.  I have a special wrench.  Not difficult.  It is about a one liter container that you have to twist off and twist a new one on.  They're about $20, but what I save in water damage is well worth it."
Thank you. I will add that to the list.
"I hadn’t heard of Lime before today, and just wow, it reminds me so much of the App Store. [It looks great!](https://twitter.com/coronux/status/1146374403112013825)"
Sweet thanks
"Dentist here. Cochrin review showed Sonicare no better then regular toothbrush. The best automatic is the Oral-b. What makes it good is the fact that the head oscillates in a circle. 2.5 more effective at plaque removal than regular toothbrush and Sonicare. I’m going to do a Reddit oral hygiene video some time.  

Edit: Cochrane not Cochrin - it was late last night and on my iphone

It’s a bad idea anyway. 18 seems far away but it really isn’t. Patience grasshopper.
Perhaps don’t use babies as underwear

I didn't even think about the fingerprints and the writing experience on that.  And I don't think I would be buying the actual paperlike brand rather a knock off of it.
"Time's up, let's do this."
"Yeah i just got F4 recently and noticed this, however ive still been able to have some fun in the game just by driving and im treating it more as a collectathon now, trying to get all the cars."
"Condoms, drug paraphernalia, acne medication bottles... Or maybe just CDs and stuff like that"
"Toilette is a weaker, Parfum stronger... its up to you and what you prefer 2 of my 3 are Toilette one is Parfum.. Toilette most likely won't last all day but is great for a night out, parfum is great for all day but can be a little cloying on a hot day or the first 30 minutes or so"
