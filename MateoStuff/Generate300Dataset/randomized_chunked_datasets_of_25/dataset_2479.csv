7796,"Roger that. Appreciate the info. Price point isn't really a concern. I'm looking anywhere from $750-2K+. I'm leaning towards the Pro? Because some people were complaining the air overheats. Would you suggest buying a year old model? I heard the older macs are more reliable, or atleast you don't have to worry about kinks. Beyond that I was looking into Dell & Lenovo 2 in 1's... pretty outside of my element though, confusing with all the options.

All I care about is schooling, and preferably note taking in class. I may buy mac air and an ipad pro combo (I heard the notetaking on the ipad can't be matched).

Any info is appreciated! Thanks for all the work you do putting this all together.",best laptop for general use

51487,"Iâ€™m using the apple silicone one atm. Feels really good and very grippy. Have heard some people complaining about the corners peeling of but have had mine for a month and still looks good as new. 

I really donâ€™t think port covers are necessary at all, I would personally just get annoyed by them. I would also definitely stay away from the apple clear case. It looks really bad with the MagSafe magnets showing, is very slippery and the plastic buttons are very hard to use. Not to mention it feels very cheap. IMO the worst case apple have ever produced.",best iphone case
