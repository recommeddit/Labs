50555,best rap album,"I love Aquemini and its production, but I prefer ATLiens. It's just so brilliantly understated, which creates the perfect semi-conscious southern hip-hop vibe throughout the album."

34031,best Pokemon game,"Crystal is my favorite but damn it's bad lol

Second one is of course, Pokemon TCG 2 on game boy"
29895,best money managing app,I cannot recommend YNAB enough. It was truly changed my life. Keep in mind I am a college drop out with a modest $17/hour office job. It took me a while to into the rhythm of it but now I cannot look back. Iâ€™m so glad I kept trying.
7796,best laptop for general use,"Roger that. Appreciate the info. Price point isn't really a concern. I'm looking anywhere from $750-2K+. I'm leaning towards the Pro? Because some people were complaining the air overheats. Would you suggest buying a year old model? I heard the older macs are more reliable, or atleast you don't have to worry about kinks. Beyond that I was looking into Dell & Lenovo 2 in 1's... pretty outside of my element though, confusing with all the options.

All I care about is schooling, and preferably note taking in class. I may buy mac air and an ipad pro combo (I heard the notetaking on the ipad can't be matched).

Any info is appreciated! Thanks for all the work you do putting this all together."
41659,movies like Inception,- Mr. Nobody

51487,best iphone case,"Iâ€™m using the apple silicone one atm. Feels really good and very grippy. Have heard some people complaining about the corners peeling of but have had mine for a month and still looks good as new. 

I really donâ€™t think port covers are necessary at all, I would personally just get annoyed by them. I would also definitely stay away from the apple clear case. It looks really bad with the MagSafe magnets showing, is very slippery and the plastic buttons are very hard to use. Not to mention it feels very cheap. IMO the worst case apple have ever produced."
5984,best programming language for web development,"Imo, even with django, python doesn't feel like it should be used for the web. PHP most certainly does, as does ruby on rails."
70034,best major to study in college,"The OP did that too, to be fair. I think that's what was the real problem."
10660,best suitcase lock,"Just also an FYI, those tiny TSA and luggage locks are pathetic.  Not only can I clip it in half with pliers, but itâ€™s the easiest lock to pick ever.  I can pick it with a gum wrapper probably."
17744,best Kardashian,Wdym? Do you mean when kaitlyn caused that car accident?

Kind of kidding but if you must there's Mystic Aquarium, Foxwood or Mohegan Sun casinos, Frank Pepe's pizza, Dinosaur State Park, Mark Twain House..."
