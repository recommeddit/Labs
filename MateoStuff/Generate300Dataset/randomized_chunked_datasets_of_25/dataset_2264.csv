The first paragraph introducing the female MC has this beautiful imagery of white Leningrad nights and jasmine June and the intoxication from life that belongs to the young. 

I haven’t read the book in a few years, but this first image and many others (I won’t share them because spoilers) will forever be seared into my mind because of how achingly beautiful they are. 

It’s a trilogy, and all three books are huge, so you should have many days of indulgence ahead. Eventual HEA in book 3

Now, I’ve seen some people write very long complaints about how the relationship (more importantly the mmc) is problematic, and tbh, by modern standards, maybe they are. 

But this is a historical novel, and very very realistic in terms of character development, so moral relativism is very important to keep in mind. (Consent, for example, is defined differently.) It’s definitely not a book written with modern sensibilities. 

I personally never found anything that borders on the abusive behaviour people seem to complain about. Maybe the mmc is not the type of boyfriend/husband who would suit me, but I am also nothing like the fmc. 

Anyway, definitely not like your regular historical romance novel. It’s got one foot in the literary fiction genre imo, but was a thoroughly cathartic and immersive experience",best romantic novel
