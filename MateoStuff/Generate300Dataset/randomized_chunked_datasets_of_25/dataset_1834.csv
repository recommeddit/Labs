You’re argument makes it sound like if I use my debt card and I have zero funds in the bank, its not a failure. The bank rejected the transaction, so does the store let me walk out with my purchase? Nope, the store doesn’t give a shit, if t was able to talk to the bank or if I’m out of funds. There is no transaction and the purchase ends. Period, their not going to cut hairs and quibble about which side had an issue...",axios alternatives reddit

73594,"Far and away the best power bank I have used to charge my Pixel 3aXL and my MS Surface Pro 2 is the [J-Go Tech Tanker](https://www.amazon.com/26800mAh-Portable-Recharge-Delivery-Charging/dp/B07HFLQMT9). I used it on my 2.5 week one-bag trip through the UK/IE and it saved my life a number of times. It probably wouldn't meet the standard of the ""ultralight"" folks, but for me, it was an indispensible part of the bag, as it was one of the only chargers capable of both the capacity and the wattage required to charge my surface pro _and_ my phone at the same time. It also did proper PD fast charging for my Pixel.

The bank alone got me five extra hours of simultaneous use-and-charge on the surface when I failed to charge it overnight and needed it on a train ride. It was a lifesaver and has transitioned to being a regular part of my daily bag as well. The battery life has held up admirably.

(Also, for anyone wondering how I hooked up that old surface model to it, I used [this cable](https://www.amazon.com/J-Go-Tech-Surface-Chargers-Microsoft/dp/B07KY31Q4Y) from the same manufacturer)",best battery bank
38329,"The reason I never read much in terms of digital is it gets lost in the shuffle. 

I get an email, I open it up click the link and start reading only to get another email and while I'm on a phone or computer, I tend to get distracted easily, whether by work or other. With physical mediums i can block all of it out.

Another issue is they send out too much stuff. If I get 3 emails a day each highlighting a different article, im going to stop clicking because i simply won't read most of them. It ends up becoming a chore of inbox management.

The sites are also usually horribly designed. I don't mind ads, but the ads on digital publications are the worst clickbait whereas with print they tend to be more thought out and relevant. They also massively get in the way. Massivr banner that takes up half the screen then every few paragraphs is an add that covers text, 2 or 3 pop ups. Stuff like that. I don't like using an ad blocker because I like to support the sites I use, but the ads on a lot of news sites, especially local are horrible.",best newspapers to read

920,"Electrix makes [very well-regarded desk lights.](http://www.electrixtask.com/office_task_main.htm)  And they make them in the US!

They are pretty pricey (compared to your average Wal-Mart or Ikea lamp,) but most of them will last for as long as you will, provided you don't abuse them (gentle adjustments, don't carry them by hinged parts, etc.)  I wouldn't say the gooseneck designs are BIFL, but the spring-arm ones should be (although you might need to replace the spring after a while.)

I think everything carries a 3-year warranty, but I'm not 100% sure.  Most of the things I saw do.  Electrix also sells replacement parts too if you do need to fix something.",best desk lamp

Yes it was clutch, but both times the iconic plays were special teams, defense, or the other teams scoring drive. I blatantly said it was entirely circumstantial, but you're kidding yourself if you don't think a ton of fans still think of Montana for big clutch moments.  You mention the Rice TD not being iconic but I beg the differ. Pretty sure that whole drive is legendary from Montana calmly pointing out John Candy in the stands, to driving down field and scoring the latest go ahead touchdown in Super Bowl history.",best NFL player
