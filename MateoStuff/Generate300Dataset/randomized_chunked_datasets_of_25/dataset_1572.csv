49338,best gaming monitor,"Ye it’s an awesome monitor, but be aware of glowing effect as it’s pretty common for ips to have such a problem. Also on downsides it’s definitely not a 1ms response time monitor and the hdr is terrible. So i’ve listed all the problems that u might face. I’m using this monitor for a year now and apart from these problems it’s pretty awesome"
54562,best artisan mousepad alternatives,I was mostly looking at the Zero since it's closest to the QCK but I'm also looking at the Otsu.
51196,best rap album,I only count his solo work and even though Flashing Lights is in my top 5 Kanye songs I still think Graduation isn't as consistently great as something like CD or even TLOP even though that might drop down my list
56564,best desktop monitor,"When people are talking about monitors they usually *mean* 1440p.  The ""k"" in 4K comes from the fact it is **3840**x2160 - the 3840 is about 4,000 so people say 4k. Also, 4k is 4x the resolution of 1080P so it makes more sense. 

Calling 1440p ""2k"" just doesn't fit the same guidelines, but that's usually what people mean"
51839,best iphone case,"What was the issue with the knockoff Apple silicone cases? Are they the red white black trio you hold in the picture together? 

From ali? Cost? Magsafe?"
60684,Best comedy show on Netflix,I think you spelled jeselnik correctly
52551,best hiphop album,"Notorious, Wu-tang, Mobb Deep, Gang Starr, Redman, Big L, A Tribe Called Quest, The Roots were all releasing classic albums around this time. They're not all NYC, but East Coast."
3116,best webcamera,"Doesn't the very fact that you _can_ use a phone as a better-quality replacement for a webcam _using that very same bandwidth limited interface_ basically mean this isn't a problem?

Like a high-end webcam could just have more on-board image processing ala smartphones, use the same interface, and the result would be comparable image quality. But evidently this doesn't happen, if OP's assessment is correct."
50699,best rap album,That Wayne feature is definitely a standout this year
56132,best action and adventure movie,"That movie deserved better. I understand why people skipped it, though. The promotion and advertising repelled me back in the day, but when I finally put it on out of curiosity one day, I was blown away. It wasn't high art, but it was better than most other action flicks back then. At least it's getting some recognition, now."
71495,best movies with a cool twist,The prestige is even better when you know the twist. There are so many details you notice when watching it a second time
62097,Best RPG game on PS4,Dark souls 3. Have fun. Not exactly the same but you will enjoy yourself
14852,best romantic novel,Same here. Very surprised about Kiss Quotient and Tessa Dare. Meh.
22242,best celebrity,"He's barely a celebrity, but Bryan Poole (guitarist for of Montreal) is about the coolest guy in indie rock.  And the guys in Surfer Blood also stand out in my mind for being especially awesome."

60420,Best comedy show on Netflix,First two seasons were some of the tightest I’ve ever seen. Every episode was a classic. Third season started off well but dropped in quality. I was saw about the cancellation but not surprised.
39659,best podcast for biologists,Wow in the World is an NPR science podcast for kids. Really good
61769,Best RPG game on PS4,"Persona 5. 
Bloodborne. 
Nier Automata. 
World of Final Fantasy. 
South Park."
22886,best celebrity,"Penn and Teller need to be at the top of this list. At the end of every show they do (which is at least 5 per week) they literally run out of the doors ahead of everyone else so that they can personally shake everyone's hand and thank them for coming. They'll sign whatever you want for free, talk to you, and take pictures. They've been doing this for over 20 years and always talk about how appreciative they are of their fans. I haven't met them on the street, and it is somewhat anecdotal, but I hear they are exactly as approachable outside their shows, too, and will make time to chat/sign things as well."
11366,best gifts for dad,How dare you give me the 3am feels.
42155,movies like Inception,"Oldboy. Very similar stylistically. ""After being kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days."" It is a South Korean film so subtitles."
