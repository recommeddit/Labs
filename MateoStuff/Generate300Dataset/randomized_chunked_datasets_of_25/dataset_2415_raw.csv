Short Poppies is great for fans of Flight of the Conchords or Chris Lilley-style shows.
I haven't but I saw someone else say the same thing!
"Watership Down takes the cake for me.  I love Richard Adams' writing in that novel.  Pirate Latitudes by Michael Crichton was really enjoyable for me too.  I don't have much to compare to though, because this is not a genre that I frequent."
"Third. Also, cell phone charging cables are vastly superior."
A 'spoiler' here would already be giving the title of a movie.
"Wow, holy hell, that is like body armor."
"Awesome I have one similar, my grandparents always had us grandkids and parents take Christmas photos every year for their Christmas cards but stopped after my grandpa died because it just made my grandma sad, so last year we did an updated one all of us as teens and young adults seated based on height with and without spouses, then we did a few recreations of how we sat for a few of the photos the normal and silly ones, was funny having my little cousin sitting in my lap as a teen for that.  My grandma cried seeing the photos and said it is one of the best presents she's gotten from all of us since some of us don't live in the area anymore."
Liquid crap
The Shop~ it’s on Milpas. Best breakfast.
"the others, the departed, old boy (korean), welcome to the JLA (korean)
the departed (and it's original infernal affairs) and welcome to the JLA are kind of twisty thrillers so it isn't as much a twist ending as the movie catching you off guard every 10 minutes.
 
I liked the endings of Saw 1 and 2 as well. 

Also haven't seen the original twist ending movie mentioned here but if you haven't seen it this the original american twist ending movie: The usual suspects"
Came here to say this. Would also add that if you're even slightly into wine Walla Walla is incredible.
"It's all fun and games until your friend keels over into your cabinet full of glassware. Don't worry, the potted plants I'd put in front of it broke his fall.

We don't do nitrous anymore."
"Look around the room you're in. 

Nearly everything you see came across a mechanical engineers desk in some stage of development."
I'm personally using the [Supershieldz](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Generation-Anti-Glare-Anti-Fingerprint-Replacement/dp/B07K1JR66F/ref=mp_s_a_1_12?keywords=supershieldz+ipad+pro+12.9&qid=1564635686&s=gateway&sprefix=super+shield+iPad+pro+12&sr=8-12) and it's the best bang for your buck. The Elecom has even less grain but cost 3 times more.
I bought the same black leather case a few days ago.  Looks nice!
"Bald and Bankrupt is my personal favorite. He's a travel blogger that goes to areas that tourists particularly don't travel to - like former Soviet countries. He has a knack for hitting it off with locals, and he also loves traveling to old, forgotten soviet towns."
"Just wanted to say that Canada will treat you well. Some of the negative points described in response to your comment are apt for suburbs but not indicative of the whole country. I have lived in Europe and to compare, you will have much more social mobility here; be able to actually afford property and build real equity in a way that you can pass down to your children in a way that you cannot in Europe (we complain about the cost of buying houses in big cities like Toronto and Vancouver but *it doesn't hold a candle* to the expense of owning in Paris or London); buy whatever the hell car you want and not have to worry about a tax on the engine size; and outdoor activities are incredible here. It is an enormous country so many cities have built 'out' from the downtown cores, which leads to problems listed accurately in u/polskadz13's comment (parks are not as nice as Europe, too many Boston Pizza's, cookie-cutter neighbourhoods, comparatively weak public transit system, etc.) but the ease with which you can live outside of town and drive in is incredible. It is a great place. Many of us do not travel and live abroad ever in our lives and therefore begin to miss out on how unique Canada really is. Et nous parlons français aussi!"
Cranberry and vodka. Sweet wine. Hard ciders.
"UC/public schools in descending order (generally): Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Irvine, Davis, Cal Poly SLO.

Private: Stanford, USC, Pepperdine."
"Holy fuck, I've had Timecrimes floating around in my mind for months at least, trying to figure out what the hell it was called.  I remember enjoying it quite a bit."
"As of right now in order:

5. Darling in the Franxx

6. Cowboy Bebop

10. From the New World

With honorable mentions going to Banana Fish, Assassination Classroom, Vinland Saga, Re:Zero, Evangellion, Made in Abyss, HxH 2011, and FLCL. It’s really tough picking 10. I think upon rewatching some these my list is very much subject to change though."
"A basic skincare routine.

I’m talking like cleanse, moisturize, sunscreen, and if you’re really adventurous/ in need, get yourself a topical for acne or concerns. 
Amazing for your self esteem, and also becomes a form of self care eventually. It’s so easy to forget to take care of yourself."
I hope you get all these things. And since the stepsons are teenagers I say screw them and start throwing mushrooms in everything. They're big enough to pick them out if it bothers them!
"Thank you for this! I hadn’t realized that it was so bad for my teeth! Ive been using it for years, no wonder i have such bad dental hygiene..."
"Great resource. Definitely going to come back to this in a few months when I look for something to take hiking/camping/to the lake/etc instead of my nice, expensive phone."
