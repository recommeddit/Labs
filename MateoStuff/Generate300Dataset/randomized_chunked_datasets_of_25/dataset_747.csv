40312,"Normally I would recommend the 5700xt. However, I see this is your first build. The AMD drivers for their graphics cards are not great at the moment, and cause some system instability for some people, especially under load. If youâ€™re tech savvy enough to find out how to correct some of the issues and do it yourself, then I think itâ€™s a great deal! But, if youâ€™re not comfortable with that, and you want something that just works, I would go for a 2060 super with a 3600x. I encourage you to do a little research on that topic before you make your final decision. 

In regard to waiting for the 4000 Series CPU it 3000 series GPU, unless you want to wait until mid summer to fall, just buy what is available now. Many components are having their (rumored) release dates pushed back due to Corona

EDIT: Also I see you donâ€™t have peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse). I recommend factoring that I to the cost of your build. I made that mistake and spent more than I wanted to lol",best midrange CPU

20181,"I used to run a 4-mile circuit every other day that included my own version of 'heartbreak hill.'  Struggled with it mightily until the day that song game on right before I hit the hill, and the good part kicked in halfway through.  Ended up sprinting up the hill and finishing the run super-strong.  

After that I carefully edited every playlist of mine to include that song at just the right time, and the days I screwed it up by going too fast or slow, I performed much worse on the hill.  Never thought the music I listened to would matter during a workout until then.",best workout music
64983,"I agree that there aren't good bagel places, the best is probably Bagel Cafe in IV, but that's a trek and it'll be filled with hungover college students. 

Mexican food: La Super Rica, Los Agaves, and Lily's Tacos are all pretty good and very affordable. Mony's is supposed to be pretty good, although I'll admit that I haven't tried it so I can't offer a personal recommendation.

I'm a big fan of Zen Yai for Thai food, and Tap Thai is pretty good too. China Pavilion has greasy/Americanized Chinese food, and China Palace in Montecito has a good lunch special. Something's Fishy has really cheap and pretty decent sushi, but you have to sit at the counter, not the grills. Kai also has fairly good sushi, and it's definitely cheaper than somewhere like Arigato or Sakana. Not sure about Banh Mi, the only somewhat okay one I've had in SB was at Blue Owl, but it wasn't stellar. Noodle City in Goleta has the best Vietnamese in town, but it won't compare to that of LA or SF.

65152,"Overall Verizon has the best coverage probably. 

But I've switched from them to T-Mobile about 6 years ago, I guess, and my coverage with T-Mobile has only gotten better. Drove all the way thru West Virginia and didn't lose my signal once, and that was always the worst spot I had to travel to. Plus when I go to the Bahamas I get free data there (and like 100 other countries)

Editing to add: my plan is 3 phone lines with unlimited everything (after 50 GB they can slow you down but it's never happened to me), and 20 GB of tethering data, and Hulu. I think it's $123.",best phone service company

22379,"For a couple years I went to a private school in Connecticut. My last year there, Bill Murray's sons transferred in. Neither was in my grade, but one of them was in the play with me. I was super nervous, but I was an SNL fan my whole life and had the 20th anniversary book that talked about all the cast members and behind the scenes stuff. After the show I (really shyly) said hi and told him I was a fan and asked him to sign it. He said ""whoa! I haven't even seen this yet! Cool!"" and then told the biggest lie ever told and said I was good in the show (I was awful, I forgot all my lines). 

Weirdly, this wasn't the first time I saw him. When I was about 6 we were at a restaurant in new jersey and he and his wife were at another table. Ghostbusters had just come out and I wanted to say hi but my parents stopped me.

Nice dude.
