7579,best laptop for general use,"Hi, I am looking for a device that is portable and light, and moderately powerful. I want a laptop mainly for schoolwork and for working away from home (libraries, cafes ect) therefore portability is a must, but I'd also like the device to handle certain programmes such as Vegas or Ableton so that I can also work and develop my hobbies in the meantime. Gaming capabilities are not a must though it would be a plus if this device could run games of the likes of minecraft, the sims and such."

I personally still use Cydia but definitely wouldn’t mind using Zebra in the future because it’s basically a modern version of Cydia with the same UI but more modern."

8470,best toothpaste,"I learned in marketing class that even if 5 out of 5 dentists recommend a toothpaste, the ad will still say ""4 out of 5 dentists"" because ""5 out of 5"" sounds too good to be true. 

Also, a toothpaste must be pretty shitty if a dentist wouldn't recommend using it."

64986,best places to eat in Santa Barbara,"Check out Edomasa for cheap and decent sushi. It's more a late-night spot, opens at 6pm every night. I'll do Daily Grind if I'm looking for a bagel but don't expect NY/PHL bagel quality/taste."
