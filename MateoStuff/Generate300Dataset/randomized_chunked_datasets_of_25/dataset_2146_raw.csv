True. But so uplifting. The concert scene gives me shivers every time.
"THIS. Merino wool is unbelievable. It's cool and breezy in the summer and keeps your feet toasty in the winter. That, and you can wear them for at the very least a week, 24 hours a day, until they need a wash. I went through a Russian winter and an Albanian summer with five pairs of Merino socks."
Do pelicans hit your windows like in Finding Nemo?
"I tend not to read lists tbh, but I'm not surprised at it's inclusion so high up. I think it's considered a masterpiece amongst the more literary speculative fiction fans, as well as a lot of other authors themselves."
"Sick!! I got the soft, though I'm curious about the xsoft I'm worried that I won't be able to sell such an expensive pad in the aftermarket. Seems like soft is the popular option so I went with that.

What differences did you notice between xSoft and Soft for the Hayate Otsu ?"
"That looks great, thank you very much!!"
Robot and Frank. It's such a weird script just filled with left turns you don't expect.
"I met Chelsea Handler when I lived in telluride, and to be honest, I'm not even sure I can call it meeting her, because she was so rude about the incident. I was taking the gondola home after having a few drinks with my friends, headphones in, minding my own business. The gondola stops half way at a restaurant and she and a friend were waiting to get on. She spots me, and very loudly announces to her friend that she isn't going to ride with someone they didn't know. Her friend rolls his eyes and tells her that I probably don't care who she is and to just get on the gondola. Keep in mind, I hadn't even taken a second glance, I didn't care. She reluctantly gets on, but the entire time she kept glaring at me and huffing under her breath. She gave off huge ""I'm more important than you"" vibes.

Also while I worked up there I had to tell Coolio he couldn't smoke a joint on the porch of the place I worked at. He was cool about it."
Thanks for this awesome list.
I remember when that was the most viewed ever with about 40 million views.  Back before the bots for Bieber and Gaga.

No. No you will not.
"There's a difference between letting terrorists win,and printing something needlessly insensitive in your paper.

Look at it this way. Terrorists are also opposed to women showing their bodies in public. Does that mean the NYT is obligated to put a naked woman on their cover?"
Damn ok. What it's more arcade?
"This is just rephrasing what he said in different words, surely. Perfectly normal stuff by 19th century standards."

"*The Wheel of Time*, Robert Jordan. Do it.   
Edit: And if you haven't read them, *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are the original gangstas of this genre."

I’ve compared it to the elecom, and I prefer it for the price and feel using the pencil. 

There was also another post a while back on a video comparing it to the paper like (don’t have it on hand...) which found that it was a lot better than the paper like too"
"Came here for this.

"rodeo has influenced the past five years of hip hop  
wolf is some of tylers best, although i do agree flower boy would have been a better spot in retrospect"
Me too! But my mam's actually glad. I moved 350 miles away last year and she's been begging me to come back ever since.
"I have been running linux mint on couple of my machines for years and I am happy that I can change it as my needs change. It has a pleasant interface and lots of software that can be installed from its ""store"" easy, if you are a new to it.  Whatever you install, make sure it meets your needs all around. You can also read on their website, how long they are going to support it."
