54578,best artisan mousepad alternatives,"Yeah I'd say Raiden is faster, but not way faster. Hien takes a bit of getting used to. If you want speed, comfort, and durability, Raiden is an easy win."

Tried VS Code and it's just not the same."
27880,best breakfast foods,"MONKEY BREAD!
Just split some biscuits in half, shake them in a bag with sugar and cinnamon, clump them together in a dish like pan. Take excess sugar and cinnamon and mix it with a lot of melted butter and pour it on top of the biscuits. Then bake like normal biscuits."
52074,best iphone case,"Thirded. 

I've also been using the magpul cases since the iPhone 4. Nothing has protected my phone as well as their cases. Currently using the magpul bump case with my 5. 

I'd say the bump cases are more premium than the field cases and worth the upgrade."

46527,best trick or treating candy,">but it's hot here, so M&Ms are good enough.

That is also the reason why they were ~~copied from smarties~~ created  in the first place, so they wouldn't melt in the hands of soldiers in WWII in the tropical climates.The US army was the first client"
33837,best Pokemon game,"Ideally you at least play all of gen 3-5. These games are expensive and riddled with fake copies though. Still it’s worth playing if you can get real copies.

Emerald and platinum are the best of their trio, and then get one of every other duo.


Heartgold/soulsilver of gen 4 is imo the greatest Pokémon and very much worth a play.



Regarding remakes, I’d say fire red/leaf green and Heartgold/soulsilver perfectly replace the originals.


Omega ruby and alpha sapphire unfortunately cut content from the excellent emerald version. 


They also have a different style and some changes to the story. It’s like a bit of a reimagining of the originals, and not as direct a remake as the other remakes. So it’s worth playing emerald and omega ruby/alpha sapphire."
9607,best dorm hall at UCSB,"I always noticed that the people who stayed friends after first year were those who stayed at FT. I lived in Santa Cruz and I loved it though, on campus and a very short walk to Campus Point."
55453,best action and adventure novel series,"Just finished Rise, and jumped right into Heir. Really enjoying the series!"
33482,best electric car,"If that logic holds you can literally use deduction and say if you can’t afford a $50k car, you can’t afford a $40k car, and if you can’t afford a $40k car, you can’t afford a $30k car, and so on... and your purchasing power will be exactly zero.

So most people definitely have a line somewhere, if your line wasn’t $60k I don’t know why you mentioned that price point in your original comment, you should have just mentioned whatever your affordability threshold was, whether it’s $10k or $30k, and it’s perfectly fine because obviously a lot of people can’t afford $30k+ cars, or any new cars.

So yeah, the reality is that a lot of people who wouldn’t spend $$60k on a car would actually be ok with $50k, and the sale figures support that. The demand curve is a *curve*, not a step function."

34678,best NFL player,"Seeing this made me realize Kurt Warner kinda got shafted.  The greatest undrafted player ever.  He won two league MVPs, one Super Bowl MVP, and led his teams to 3 Super Bowls (including being the QB of the “Greatest Show on Turf”).  

He was really only 90th on the 2010 list and off the list this year completely?  I get that his career didn’t have the longevity or sustained success of the others, but his peaks were some of the best!"

30805,best country to live in,"Language is only difficult phonetically, but when you get used to hearing it, deciphering it becomes a lot easier. Gramatically, I find it quite easy. A lot easier than German and English, that's for sure. After a year of living in Denmark as an exchange student, I was more or less fluent, and I didn't even put that much effort in it."

12316,best gifts for mom,"I've been asked for lots of kitchen stuff (specialty baking supplies and the like). Unless they ask, though, don't go buying things that imply housework needs to happen (like a vacuum) or you're going to have a bad time.

Is she into knitting or crochet? A few skeins of high quality yarn or a nice sewing basket are a great gift. Does she like games? Get a Nintendo 2DS or 3DS and some games (my wife loves Professor Layton games). Does she love tea? Find her favorites and put together a tea kit (tea, nice mug, cookies). 

Basically, find something she enjoys and get something that will increase or allow enjoyment."
