33837,"Ideally you at least play all of gen 3-5. These games are expensive and riddled with fake copies though. Still it’s worth playing if you can get real copies.

Emerald and platinum are the best of their trio, and then get one of every other duo.


Heartgold/soulsilver of gen 4 is imo the greatest Pokémon and very much worth a play.



Regarding remakes, I’d say fire red/leaf green and Heartgold/soulsilver perfectly replace the originals.


Omega ruby and alpha sapphire unfortunately cut content from the excellent emerald version. 


They also have a different style and some changes to the story. It’s like a bit of a reimagining of the originals, and not as direct a remake as the other remakes. So it’s worth playing emerald and omega ruby/alpha sapphire.",best Pokemon game

So most people definitely have a line somewhere, if your line wasn’t $60k I don’t know why you mentioned that price point in your original comment, you should have just mentioned whatever your affordability threshold was, whether it’s $10k or $30k, and it’s perfectly fine because obviously a lot of people can’t afford $30k+ cars, or any new cars.

So yeah, the reality is that a lot of people who wouldn’t spend $$60k on a car would actually be ok with $50k, and the sale figures support that. The demand curve is a *curve*, not a step function.",best electric car
