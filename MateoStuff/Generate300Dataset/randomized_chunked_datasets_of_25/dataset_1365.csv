67322,axios alternatives reddit,"You realize weekly downloads don't mean shit right?  If you download a repository and somewhere down the chain `axios` is being used but you aren't explicitly using it in your project, it still gets downloaded and the count increases.
Oh shit! Your `node_modules` got fucked some how, you reinstall the project, boom you just increased the count again.
My point is that weekly downloads are skewed as fuck."
36055,best alcoholic drink,"straight whiskey (and most liquors) supposedly doesn't have any net carbs.  While it still contains calories, straight liquor is going to have the lowest overhead in terms of drunkenness vs. fatness. 

So get yourself some decent bourbon and go for it."

In game it looks great. I've played red rising 2. Metro series. Apex. Some CS. And halo CE and 2."
67123,best places to skydive in california,"There was one place (Tennessee) where you could jump as a 16 year old. The way they did it, tandem rig manufacturer allowed it, and the tandem instructor was the one who owned the rig, not the dropzone. But that TI moved to Australia (I think) with his rig, so that is no more."

9620,best dorm hall at UCSB,"Besides ft, there is san Miguel, San nicholas, santa rosa, santa cruz, and anacapa. These are all in the same general area. I'm pretty sure that San Miguel and San nicholas have no triples,only doubles and singles while the rest have all three options. 
Last year I was in San Miguel on the scholars floor. Being scholars for didn't make a huge difference as a lot of people were still down to smoke and drink with everyone. I knew everyone on my floor. But San Miguel is not coed floors,  it alternates boy girl by floors. There was still mingling in lounges though and we had the same ra as fourth floor, who also stayed on the 4th floor most of the time and left us alone. San nic is another 8 story tower but it is arranged differently so it has coed floors. 
The other three are all two story coed floors, but there is still a little separation between genders. I heard nothing about santa rosa. Santa Cruz kinda has the chillers rep. And then anacapa. 
One of my friends lived in SC and was in a triple after requesting double. I feel like there are a lot of triples in the 2 story clusters and they also kinda look like swastikas sooooo....
It don't matter
Really I'm not too sure if it makes that big of a difference"
