9620,"Besides ft, there is san Miguel, San nicholas, santa rosa, santa cruz, and anacapa. These are all in the same general area. I'm pretty sure that San Miguel and San nicholas have no triples,only doubles and singles while the rest have all three options. 
Last year I was in San Miguel on the scholars floor. Being scholars for didn't make a huge difference as a lot of people were still down to smoke and drink with everyone. I knew everyone on my floor. But San Miguel is not coed floors,  it alternates boy girl by floors. There was still mingling in lounges though and we had the same ra as fourth floor, who also stayed on the 4th floor most of the time and left us alone. San nic is another 8 story tower but it is arranged differently so it has coed floors. 
The other three are all two story coed floors, but there is still a little separation between genders. I heard nothing about santa rosa. Santa Cruz kinda has the chillers rep. And then anacapa. 
One of my friends lived in SC and was in a triple after requesting double. I feel like there are a lot of triples in the 2 story clusters and they also kinda look like swastikas sooooo....
