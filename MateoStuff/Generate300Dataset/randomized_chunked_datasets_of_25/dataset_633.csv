16498,best sunglasses for fashion,"> I've read that people think that Ray-Bans are crappy for the price, but I've had two pairs of Ray-Bans, and I really like them both. They've held up well over time, I like the styles, and they've protected my eyes from the sun. Not really sure what people think makes them ""crappy.""

Ditto. I have a pair of the clubmasters and I love them. Just recently I scored a pair of the New Wayfarers from a thrift shop and they're great.* I think a lot of people hating on them don't often shop at that price point. I've had a couple roommates complain, saying, ""*Why would anyone spend that much on sunglasses? I have the same style and mine were 5/10/15 dollars.*"" 

Ray Bans get knocked off a lot and are probably one of the few household brands known primarily for sunglasses and frames. No one is surprised that Prada sunnies are super expensive; and not many people recognize when they're buying knock off Prada styles. But Ray Bans are ubiquitous and *seem* more obtainable. The reality is that they're still not cheap, and that frustrates a lot of people. 


^*I've ^become ^quite ^good ^at ^deciphering ^serial ^codes ^and ^evaluating ^quality ^level ^to ^determine ^how ^likely ^an ^item ^is ^to ^be ^authentic. ^I'm ^certain ^these ^are ^a ^genuine ^pair ^of ^Ray ^Bans."

26256,best politician,"Someone who hasn't been mentioned that I think was critical was Henry Clay. He stepped up consistently when the country needed him, worked to get both sides to the table and calm crisis. He was a very bright guy, knew how to negotiate, and had some more progressive ideas. Though he owned slaves he wanted to move toward emancipation, he believed in the rights of Native Americans to their lands, he supported independence for many Latin American nations, and he tried his best to avoid war, supporting national interests to keep the nation together"

30472,best Mexican war to study,"Upvoting this. Unfortunately the Three Kingdoms period has such a place in the romanticization of Ancient Chinese history that few ordinary Chinese these days are able to tell what is historical fact from what is the fiction that Luo Guanzhong novelized. 

This war involved so many people and such a large swath of land and resources that it's very telling of all of Chinese history--I feel that a lot of the reasons the Han broke up and the wars began is repeated throughout Chinese history with the fall of each dynasty. If you really grok Three Kingdoms, you really do grok a large chunk of the history of Chinese wars."

34348,best NFL player,"They mention Brady having to adjust to a new offensive scheme and team. See Rodgers’ 2018-19 for how challenging just the first portion can be. 

So projecting Brady does even better now that he’s had time to jive isn’t a stretch, especially if our star WRs stay healthy throughout the season.

They are also likely taking projected strength of schedule into account, where the Bucs’ next season will be a lot easier than the Packers’."

25158,best spiderman actor,"Eric Foreman Venom will always make that original Spider-Man series lesser in my eyes. My boy Holland is perfect for the role, while Garfield was too cocky as Peter."
2621,best headphones,"One thing to keep in mind though, is how many of the full sized headphones you mentioned would need, or at least benefit form an amplifier. This adds $100-300 to the overall price. Still a good point, but it may be easier to swallow getting full sized headphones in the $100-200 range that don't need an amp.

I do fully agree with you though. I recently bought VSD3S, and some HD558's. Can't imagine ""upgrading"" from these for a few years, and my next investment is going to need an amp, and fairly pricey headphones, probably $500+ total easy."
67266,axios alternatives reddit,"That in an application http errors (which fetch doesn't throw on), call exceptions and network errors (which fetch throws on) are all almost always handled in the same way - through the error handling branch of your code. They are all errors and it does not matter what kind of errors really - you probably want to clean up and display an error message of some sort for all of them. It is handy to handle errors on fetch promise rejection, in the catch block, which means it's reasonable to have it throw on >400 as well. Sure those are valid responses, but errors nonetheless, which your application will most likely be handling just the same as, for example, a timeout or any other networking error."
