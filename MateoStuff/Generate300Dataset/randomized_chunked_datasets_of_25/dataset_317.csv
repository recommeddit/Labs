46832,best hand santizer brand,">Care to provide any references for any of that? From the five or so pages on cdc.gov that I read, I didn't find any that backed up your claim that they recommend soap and water over hand sanitizer. Of course, you can use both.

>Unless you have a bunch of crap on your hands that actually needs to be washed off, soap and water is not better than hand sanitizers.

33606,best electric car,"My $.02 — You don’t drive very many miles per day.  If I were you I would get a 2015 Nissan Leaf or 2015 Volkswagen E-golf.   The leaf has better comforts such as a heated steering wheel (SL trim) and cell phone connectivity.  The E-Golf is a better driving vehicle and is made with seemingly higher quality materials.

I would also skip the level 2 charger at home for now.  Just charge level 1 off the standard outlet- your miles driven doesn’t warrant a need for level 2 installation.  You can always install in the future if overnight charging L1 isn’t working well enough for you."
