The leaf has better comforts such as a heated steering wheel (SL trim) and cell phone connectivity.  The E-Golf is a better driving vehicle and is made with seemingly higher quality materials.

I would also skip the level 2 charger at home for now.  Just charge level 1 off the standard outlet- your miles driven doesn’t warrant a need for level 2 installation.  You can always install in the future if overnight charging L1 isn’t working well enough for you.",best electric car
