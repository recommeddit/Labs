60462,Best comedy show on Netflix,It does! It gets way better!!! Season 2 dropped a bit for me but seasons 3 and 4 were phenomenal. The point of the show shifts from S1 to S2 and then 3/4 are a tag team. Give it another try!
3273,best webcamera,"When someone asks me what to get for starting out I normally give the ""budget"" option and the ""I'm serious about doing this"" option.

If they want to do it as a hobby it's the c270 ($20), a cheap USB condenser mic ($40), lighting($20), and a $500 PC build (which I need to update at some point because it's outdated now and probably cheaper). all in you're looking at around $700 after tax.

The ""lets treat this like a business"" starter kit is a 922($50), lights($80), XLR mic ($40 used from guitar center), cheap audio interface like the Scarlette 2i2 ($160), a PC north of $1000 (also needs updating might be cheaper now), optional green screen(+$30 if bundled with lights), stream-deck mini ($60 if on sale if not on sale full stream deck at $150). All in there it's between $1400-$1600 and there's still room to grow."

Loved Zulu and gogga. Matthews was always dependable, but not the first bowler we jotted down - same league as Pringle I think."

7694,best laptop for general use,"I'm looking for a cheap laptop (no more than $500 nzd) that I can use outside of my work hours. When I'm doing extreme stuff I can usually just rdp into my work computer \[Im a software engineer so less gpu more cpu i guess\] but i'd still like to have visual studio 2019 up and running in-case I'm offline. Other than that it'll just be used for movies, the odd low graphics requiring game and emails. I'm not too picky with the screen resolution either since I'm currently using my phone to watch movies. Preferably it'll be a wee bit on the small side so I can easily carry it in my backpack. I wont need more than 250 GB storage This laptop will be replacing my home computer which had inbuilt graphics, 8gb of ram and a $80 motherboard from 5 years ago that takes 2 minutes to open Firefox so expectations are low. Needs to be running windows 10"

Beer: Blue moon is a basic ""everyone enjoys this"" beer. If you have the chance at any bar or craft brewery, try a flight of a bunch of different kinds of beers. I'm normally a light beer person but I surprisingly like a lavender stout or a coffee stout.

&#x200B;

Shots: My favorite \*slightly extra\* shot is called a breakfast shot. Its whiskey mixed with butterscotch schnapps, which tastes like a pancake, and then you chase it with orange juice. Sounds weird but it's delicious. Also, if you're a person who likes pickles, you can chase any liquor with pickle juice and there's no burn and its delicious.

&#x200B;

Cocktails: Only get a Long Island Iced Tea if you plan on blacking out/crying in my personal experience. Amaretto Sours are delicious and slightly sweeter than a whiskey sour. Martinis/Cosmopolitans are stronger than you want them to be no matter how attractive they look on tv. 

&#x200B;

Most importantly, drink a bottle of water before you go to bed and have fun!!"
