"I have stayed at the RIU Ocho Rios in Jamaica twice, both times I tipped the bartenders at the bar closest to my suite when I arrived and the service was literally impeccable, they would pick my friends and I out of a crowd and serve us right away, I would be walking by and they would call me over just to shoot the shit if they weren't busy, no complaints."
You might be mistaken good sir. I heard this Enron place bought both of those companies.
I mean if true detective isn’t on this list ..
That’s where I’m at.
"AKA ""Hang on, which character is that? What year is this? Whose parents are they?"""
"The saddle is actually really disgusting. If I had another one to compare it to for a photo you’d be able to tell. 

The orange is only a few months old and I’ve been spending a lot of the summer hiking and camping so the smart battery case has been my primary case. 

The smaller orange is also super disgusting, but hard to see without a comparison."
"I did Comp Sci. Pay is great, but long hours and stress.

If I were to do it again, I would consider:

4 year law enforcement degree at a local school. Become a cop, work your way up. Retire in 20 years with a nice pension, move into some other career at your leisure.

Some kind of trade (plumber, electrician, welder, etc.). Do a trade program and apprentice as quickly as possible. Also do part-time school for a business degree at a local school (even just a 2 year). Grind for 10 years and then start your own shop.

Both of these offer a ""cheap"" education (no crippling debt) and aren't as susceptible to the AI/automation/robot change that will likely come during your working years."
"It is a toss-up for me. One is as bad, or good, as the other. And since both of my local stores are within a mile of each other I can go from one to the other."
"I'm surprised I don't see Holy Hell mentioned much. If you're interested in cults, it's absolutely fascinating. Funny and self aware at times too."
Bars at my college kept well drinks in garbage cans.
"I would replace the battery on your current phone. I have an iPhone X, which granted, was considered ""better"" than the SE, but it's been 4 years and I have no major issues."

"At Home Depot, you ask. Some ask for proof. Some don’t. Lowe’s makes you sign up online and then it’s just a phone number."
"I'd rather just have a thicker phone

Good to know there are cases that solve this I guess"
"Now I'm picturing walking into an apartment room and seeing a random dick sticking out of the ceiling, Id be the guy grabbing a stick and poking while laughing like a kid."
Purely RO yes but some of the higher end machines actually have filters that put minerals back into the water after the water has gone through the RO membrane. Taste is superb.

"I remember Michael Holding saying the West Indies 80s team was absolute freakish that all those great players were all at the same time. 

He reminded everyone the West Indies is not one country but many. Somehow all those players, from all those countries came together to form one incredible team."
Plus one for John by lil Wayne. Good lord is that song hype personified
"... Breaking Bad seems like it should make the grade.

And is The Wire on Netflix?  (I think it's on Amazon Prime)"
"When you serve a country, you follow orders, not negotiate politics. Also, the goal of war is to end the war. It's not cut and dry. Like, we don't continue battling after the war is over."
