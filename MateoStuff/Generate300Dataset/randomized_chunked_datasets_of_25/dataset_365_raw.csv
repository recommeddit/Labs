have it delivered? or grab a friend. The person at the homedepot loaded it into my car  himself. 5 foot one just took me and my brother. 7 foot one wouldn't be that much heavier imo.
I really enjoyed John Carter for this very reason.

I love the smell of LVEB but it gives me hellish headaches. Even tried a dupe and some flankers but it was the same for them all. :(
"If you are afraid to paint a certain color, don't paint at all. That's the only winning move.

I digress. Paint Grey, because you're neutral, timeless, and, practical.

But seriously 'Prince lover' should at least get you into the purple category."
"Sorry, I downvoted initially. I mistook 360 for Xbox One. 

With a high end PC, there's no reason to buy a brand new Xbox."

"Perhaps there is a majority opinion here, yes, however, usually one finds at least one well-articulated conservative argument to every five more popular left-leaning ones (right vs. left being just an example)."
"Scrambled eggs with pepper jack cheese and banana peppers. Side of bacon, goetta and diced potatoes. SO GOOD!"
Exactly.  It's almost not worth it.
Good post. Thank you

"I am not sure if it is a rut, or if the genre splintered so much that tastes and fandoms have split up as well.  For example there are a bunch of books for singularity, cyborgs, space travel, far future, time travel, etc.  People have split up in those areas.

There is also the fact that sci-fi TV shows and movies have sucked up a lot of that fandom as well.  After you've seen Stargate, any book about a similar plot will get compared to it as well.  Considering the number of Stargate episodes and the richness being added to them by the actors themselves, it is entirely too easy to compare the book to your favorite episodes, resulting in a lower score.  That's excluding the books written in the world of that TV show, potentially resulting in a somewhat derivative work.

Not to mention that people have a limited amount of free time and attention span.  If you spend so much of it on the sci-fi on TV, Netflix, Amazon, and movies, then less attention and time is spent on equivalent books.

These things are not so when talking about the fantasy genre - compared to sci-fi, there is very little live-action fantasy.  Besides GoT I can't think of any high production fantasy show on right now."

"List is shit to be honest.  But any top 10 is going to fall down somewhere.  But Kendrick did not make the 2 best hip-hop albums of all time.  Kanye has not made a top 10 hip-hop record of all time.  No De La Soul, Mobb Deep, Fugees, Dre, Outkast, Biggie, Common, Jay Z."
Certainly above Diggs. Dunno about Adams.

"That's too bad. I've had two tertials for 12 years, and they're still going strong. I just tighten the screws every few years. I guess it shouldn't surprise me that quality has gone down."
