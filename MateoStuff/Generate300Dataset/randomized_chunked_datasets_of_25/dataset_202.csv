49334,"I have the LG 27GL83A which is the same monitor with an sRGB color gamut I think (so no nano-IPS), significantly cheaper and I'm very satisfied with it. Unless you're doing very color-sensitive work with photo/video editing and the like, I would say there's no need to get nano ips.",best gaming monitor
68308,"A Fire Upon the Deep is on my *tsundoku* shelf, and I'm tempted to read it next. Based on this thread. But I really don't want to know more details about it, to keep it completely novel, hah. I picked it up after AstronomyCast's multiple episode series on more contemporary science fiction they've read and would recommend. [Part One: Space Exploration](http://www.astronomycast.com/2017/12/ep-469-best-modern-sci-fi-for-the-science-lover-part-1-space-exploration/) if anyone is interested. Also highly recommend the podcast itself. 

I *just* finished The Three Body Problem, also per their suggestion.

I have been planning on reading horror next, for ""the season."" Starting with [Uzumaki](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20423941-uzumaki?rating=2&utm_medium=api&utm_source=book_widget)   and then Bradbury's [The October Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_October_Country?wprov=sfla1), but now I'm not sure. Maybe A Fire Upon the Deep will be a good end of November book.",best science fiction novel

45964,"My dad, as a Coca-Cola chemist, always gave out varieties of soda, asking kids which one they preferred. He stocked up on every variety. They loved it, and the parents would sometimes even ask for one. When out for that long collecting candy, you get thirsty. Give those costumed kids some bubbly candy-water.

49519,"TN is the worst in everything besides response times and price. They're used mostly in cheap gaming monitors since they can achieve high refresh rates at low costs. They tend to have a grey-ish image quality tho because they can't produce decent contrast. 

IPS are your ""good, all around"" monitors, even though their contrast still isn't fantastic (this is a downside of LCDs in general). Their quality though varies a lot. Just because a monitor has an IPS panel, it doesn't mean it's good or has good image quality. 

VA improves a lot on IPS' contrast, but sacrifice viewing angles. For gaming though this isn't a big issue, but it is for office use. They're mostly used in high-end TVs because a good VA panel is basically the best kind of LCD you can buy and they're now coming to the monitor market too but they're hard to find.",best gaming monitor
