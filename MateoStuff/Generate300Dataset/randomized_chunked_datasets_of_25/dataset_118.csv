56514,"1070 Ti is great at 1440p60 but you'll have to reduce some settings if you want frames up over the 100 mark. Lighter stuff like Overwatch and CSGO will have no issue though, my 1070 (non ti) was able to drive over 100 fps at ultra in OW at 1440p even in intense firefights

If maximum frames at all times is most important, go for a 144hz or even 240hz 1080p display. If you like crisp visuals and don't want to see pixels, I'd recommend grabbing the 1440p 24 inch Dell 144hz/G-sync unit when it goes on sale again. Check /r/buildapcsales frequently",best desktop monitor
64747,"Apparently Santa Barbara is known for the urchin, and I'd say the best sushi in town is Arrigato (spelling might be wrong) and has a perfect bar to sit at. A little pricey, but well worth in my opinion. Mony's is my favorite Mexican spot in town, but people die over Los Agaves. Also, if you can, I'd try to eat at Finch and Fork (medium-to-high priced), which is absolutely fabulous cocktails and food, also a good bar to sit at. 

Edit: forgot the most important place. Norton's. Order the Ham and Swiss melt and instead of the ham get the crispy pastrami. Fuck, it's so good.",best places to eat in Santa Barbara

3181,"I own the LifeCam Cinema and the LifeCam Studio, and they are both great webcams. The Cinema, however, as an autofocus issue that makes it focus in and out every few minutes or so. It's very noticeable. Though for $15, it's an incredibly great value. I wish they could offer better image quality under low light conditions, but pretty much all webcams are like that.

And I've also heard good things about the Logitech camera. I haven't actually owned one myself, but many reviews say its one of the best.",best webcamera
