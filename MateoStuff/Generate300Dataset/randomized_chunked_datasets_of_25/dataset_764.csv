3722,best college for research,"To your last point- while I agree that innovation and creativity drives our respective fields forward.. I would argue in the experience of my field there is another consideration. Reviewers tend to ONLY accept new research. If it is not ""novel"" enough it is rejected. Repeatability is a cornerstone of scientific progress so that trend irks me to a degree. 

So what you end up with is people trying to find the new niche and forgetting about some of the core concepts."
26791,best board games,"Cult of the 2014-18, lol"
472,best terminal file manager reddit,Thank you for the appreciation. Personally I use `nnn` for all my workflows so I have to keep it well-maintained. ;) On my desktop I use Terminator which gives me the dual pane/multi-tab functionality.
72555,best keyboard switches,"I recently got a Corsair K70 with reds because reds were proclaimed king for gaming.

I'm starting to warm up to it since it's my first mechanical, but the keys activate VERY easily. I'll find a lot of times I'm resting my fingers on the keys and pressing them without trying to. I wish I could try out blues or brown but I got this keyboard for pretty cheap refurbished so I can't complain. Just a word of warning to anyone who might read this."
42463,movies like Inception,Excellent movie. Jack blacks character cracks me the fuck up.
54048,best medicine for a cold,"1. I immediately stop drinking coffee, which basically makes me sleepy 24/7. 
2. Next, I switch it up to mostly honey/lemon tea (fresh).
3. Start drinking about half a gallon of water per day
4. Hot soups (as hot as I can tolerate)
5. Take a hot shower at least once a day 
6. If I am not eating, peeing, showering, I am napping/sleeping.
7. I take limited cold medicine during the process (only if I have to be somewhere). Many cold symptoms are caused by your body trying to heal itself. 

In 2-3 days (from first sign), everything except the cough is usually gone."
