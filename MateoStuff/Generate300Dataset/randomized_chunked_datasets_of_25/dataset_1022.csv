54268,best medicine for a cold,Gargling warm salt water is actually a great way to kill germs in the throat.
17275,best iOS game,(bully) great for kids...
47868,best graphing calculator for vector calculus,"Hey, I'm currently 8 out of 12 weeks through multivariate calculus. I've very rarely had to pull out my calculator while in lectures or on set assignments unless I want a decimal answer. Most answers are given as surds, or fractions, which can be computed with some mental gymnastics if you're comfortable and competent.

Here's a link to the [solutions to one of the assignments](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0ODrSDolTFTMDRsVVJ5MFJ4YkE). Scroll through and look at the final answers.

But still, have a calculator on you. There will be times when you'll want it and need it."
30659,best Mexican war to study,"Keep in mind that much of the territory annexed between the Rio Grande and the West coast was Mexican in name only. The northern border was hugely destabilized by Mexican independence in 1821 and what little governmental control existed before then almost entirely ceased to exist. Expansion of the Mexican state also took some time to happen after independence. In some areas the Spanish had been gone for less than a decade by the time the territory transitioned to American control. I try to avoid making unnecessary moral judgements about anyone involved, but the situation is really quite complicated to describe in our 'normal' terms."
5779,best programming language for web development,"As someone about to finish highschool looking to pursue a degree in Systems Engineering, would it be better to start learning some of those modern options or the popular ones?"
59965,best perfume,Urban Outfitters Oud Sahara. So warm and comforting with a touch of spice
65411,best phone service company,"Do you mean the 1% makes a huge difference? It seems to be that at least in my area, my former roommate had Sprint and it would regularly be the case that I had service and she didn't."
36501,best alcoholic drink,Templeton is a solid middle shelf rye I can recommend.
63815,best books for building better habits reddit,This is a great point. Thank you. Any book recommendations on this alternative view to Willpower?

42316,movies like Inception,"What the hell happened to Josh Hartnett?

He was really entertaining in this movie and kinda fell off the radar"
35610,best alcoholic drink,What the fuck is Nitequil?
40985,best instrument to play,"The kazoo, recorder or triangle would probably be up there."
2625,best headphones,"Nice post OP. I do have to say the HP50 is not a good choice for portable use. While it is a good choice from a technical and sound perspective the headband is very unique and will have people staring. It kind of makes your head look like Frankenstein. If you are punk rock and don't care then all power to you. 

For me the real point of being impressed is $350. For this much or less you can buy the HD650 or the HE400i. They are both amazing. With headphones below this I have been impressed but it wasn't like ""oh wow, what am I hearing?"" impressed. I have been so impressed with these cans that I am planning on adding the HD800 this summer (gonna find new for $900) and hopefully then the HE1000 in later 2015 or worse case scenario with my tax return in early 2016.   ;)"
44227,best items under $100,"""Having fun isn't hard when you've got a library card!"""
49614,best gaming monitor,"Yea, since then I moved to quantum dot too. Nano seems interesting, but its a heck load more of backlight, which will inevitably eat electricity and produce some more waste heat.

Thinking somewhat improved quantum dot could be winner. Mine has that double-diode qdot whatever and as far as backlight uniformity goes, its excellent. As long as one doesnt want HDR from it, then its noticeable when backlight peaks. Fairly good for less demanding HDR content.

It also heats a bit more and eats a lot more than regular QLEDs."
68277,best science fiction novel,"The Demolished Man , Bester \- fun and interesting adventure with a very dynamic lead character.

Anathem, Stephenson \- Amazing scope \- it's incredible how he manages to hold this together coherently.

The Fountains of Paradise, Clarke \- Beautifully constructed. Clarke was perhaps the greatest at crafting stories.

Tau Zero, Anderson \- Great look at what the psychological effects of extreme time dilation might be.

The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Heinlein \- Great story well told."
39286,best web browser,"Bud, I have 16 GB. Firefox crushes it."
30919,best country to live in,the reason he got voted into power if become of how blind and desperate Australia was to get out of the previous government
33549,best electric car,2018 called they want their joke back.
73663,best battery bank,"What is the weight you measured for both the Aukey and the Huawei please?  (That is, not the published weights, but YOUR weights.)  Thanks! Grams preferred :)

Added:  Also did you get a beefier cable rated for at least 30 W for charging?  What length and how much does it weigh please?  Thanks!"
4386,best text editor,I also agree. If you care about extra tooling then jetbrains products are worth it. Webstorm only cost me 40 bucks for the year. Seems like a lot since vs code is free but I get my money's worth. It's definitely saved me more than an hour over the course of a year and that's basically my hour freelancing rate.
22891,best celebrity,"Ice T was on the same flight as me, my mom, and my sister when I was younger.  My sister needed help getting her bags off the carousel but I was too busy reading Harry Potter and basically told her to fuck off.  Ice T comes walking over, shoots me the worst look, then grabs all my sisters bags and helped carry them to our car.  

I learned a good lesson that day; never help anyone because it's easier to let a celebrity do it for you."
72684,best wireless lightweight mouse,Model-D is a solid mouse. Wish I could be of more help haha. Maybe wait/hope for the Model D-?
