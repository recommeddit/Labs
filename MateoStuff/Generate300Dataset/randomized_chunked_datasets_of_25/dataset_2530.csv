44032,"You're naturally spread if you're sitting on the toilet.  If you aren't, you've got bigger problems, and your cheeks could use a rinse anyway.  You may be thinking you need to get up, but you don't.  Just stay sitting, turn dial.

You will need to adjust, but it's more a lean forward, sit up thing, if you're not sitting lopsided.  Really isn't a problem even if the cheeks do get residual spray.  Pat dry.",best items under $100

62850,"Good catch! No one's ever picked up on the Metropolis reference before.I use Bayesian models in three broad cases:

1. When I'm trying to do something beyond prediction. For example, I want to look into causal relationships or I want to evaluate a hypothesis, or I want to get a distribution as my output so I can do an economic analysis and have meaningful intervals.
2. When I want to inject significant domain knowledge into the models --- if I know that certain relationships between variables exist and I have meaningful priors.

I will also use it for inference like you mentioned, as part of EDA, as a way to get a more interpretable model and so on. I also find it can work better in cases where you really do have partial pooling.

But, yeah, for simple predictive models it's basically always XGBoost or linear regression.",Best Data Science textbook

68872,"It's good. I liked JS&MN a lot more but if those early chapters are what turned you off, *Piranesi* ought to be a lot more approachable. It doesn't explain much but then plot/mystery is fairly telegraphed, though that's not really the book's attraction. It's a slight novel in some regards but a very elegant examination of some interesting ideas (memory, identity, acculturation, Plato's theory of forms) and written in a lovely unique voice.",best science fiction novel
