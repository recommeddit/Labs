"a babysitter and a special night out with you doing something she would love.  Go see a play, eat at a fancy restaurant, go for a romantic walk etc.  And make sure to tell her how awesome you think she's doing.  

If you're looking for an actual gift, I've always wanted one of these [pendants](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2/181-1654572-0141214?url=search-alias%3Djewelry&field-keywords=loving%20family%20pendant) or a really nice locket would be great too."

"Such a great thread with little gems I didn’t know yet. 
Thanks for all the suggestions !

May I add a few games I like a lot :
- soosiz (plateform a little like Mario galaxy in 2D)
- swordigo ( action rpg in 2D )
- marathon trilogy (classic FPS)
- the butterfly dreams (puzzles)
- tiny world (mini civilization like with only buildings)"
"That's odd. Works for me IPhone 12, 14.2. Are you using latest version 1.0.4 from udevs repo?"
"Drive to Ventura and go to Beacon, lol."
"The driving forces behind high productivity are typically being organized, setting firm routines, and reducing distractions. I don’t disagree with your qualifying of the list, but not sure why it would be a criticism."
"When I worked at Home Depot I used to be jealous that the guys at Lowes across the street got to wear the blue vest and we had to wear some bullshit apron.

So there's that.

edit: Looking at some of these answers, just want to point a few things out.
HD and Lowes both have a military/veteran discount. Both allow dogs on leashes inside. Also, any HD cashier has the authority to give you 10% or $50 off, up to $50. You just have to ask for it basically."
Maybe he had a similar surname to that guy who made that skating video game?
Speed mode (2x or 4x) makes the monotonous parts so much better.

"Later Han Turmoil/Three Kingdoms period. It's like a diplomacy/""shimo"" style free-for-all where everyone else speaks the same language/culture. So many people defect/surrender and fight for another side - this rarely happens in the international multilingual wars we read about. Probably largely since China is the largest country with a relatively homogeneous culture+written language (and so can support that many groups).

Of course, there are other periods that might be somewhat similar - the Sengoku period of Japan comes to mind in particular, as do the Warring States period/Spring and Autumn period, but the literature/video games of those periods (especially those available in English) number far less than the literature/video games of the Three Kingdoms era. The Chu-Han contention is also quite fascinating, although on a much smaller scale."
"I like Jessica Simpsons Fancy - You can find it for £22-26. I bought it earlier this year and I must say, it's fantastic for the price."
">  The IPS glow is bad, like REALLY bad, even more distracting than the color shift I had on my previous TN panel. Tweaking the levels and getting used to it has helped, but it's probably my biggest problem with the monitor 

We all have our things we tolerate but this is exactly why I no longer have a single IPS display in my house and never will again. Every last one of them is complete trash. One day I hope to say the same about LCD's entirely and finally move beyond this subpar garbage technology we have been forced to accept for so long. Maybe then I can finally get my Trinitron off my desk too."

"Cyberpunk looks and feels like a combination of the SNES Shadowrun and Shadowrun: Dragonfall, really. Shadowrun in general leans a bit into magic and that portion of it is not traditionally cyberpunk, but it nails the scene perfectly. 

It's everyday people being slave wages at the mercy of corporations and law enforcement agencies that have become so powerful that they're basically the new world government, the shady heads of those corporations who see people as a means to an end, and the underground scene rebelling against it, all placed into the backdrop of a world that's had the benefit of casualized advanced technology being accessible to practically everyone.

In a cyberpunk world, your quality of life is fully dependent on where you are in the pecking order, and your status is very much a ""where you're born is where you'll stay"" situation, so there are no valiant heroes or hopeful optimists. It's a bleak, uphill climb for glory for people at the bottom of the food chain just as much as it is for those at the top. Think Game of Thrones set in the year 2600 lol."
don’t mind me here researching deep desks for my incoming 48” cx lol
"> painting everything fresh and new really helped it feel like ours

So true! The color wasn't bad in our main living areas before we painted, but when we finished, I loved it so much more. My mom's wisdom at that moment was ""because it's yours now and you have pride in it."""
"Anybody know where I might find 29""x8"" stair treads with a  matching 21""x30"" oval for the landing? I have a set that came with my home but I am unable to to find replacements and the ones I have are getting pretty ratty.

Great pad! 👌
Uh La LAAAAAAHH!!!!
Flatout to Flatout Ultimate Carnage. Still play them from time to time.
I would go so far as to say the 2001 Australia v India test series is one of the best overall series I have ever seen.
"Both are on my watch list!

Edit: though I'm not seeing Timecrimes on Netflix US"
"I have literally played all the instruments. So I can give you a categorical and objective answer to this question. The answer is the glockenspiel, it combines the versatility of the piano with the physicality of the drums and the intricacy of the xylophone. 10/10 would glocken again"
