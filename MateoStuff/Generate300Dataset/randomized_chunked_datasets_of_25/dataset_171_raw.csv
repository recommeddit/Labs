Agreed. Ready player one was suuuuuuuper predictable.
"Artist - Album

Billy Woods - Known Unknowns (I fucking love this project, but I could see it not making everyone's top 100 list let alone top 10)  

11th but most important: Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters (I'm of the opinion that this album perfectly encapsulates the bedrock upon which Hip-Hop stands)


This is my gun-to-my-head 10/10 albums just from scrolling through my spotify ATM. Pretty much all Tribe albums belong up here, a couple Wu solo albums, def more DG, MF DOOM, Danny Brown, MaddGibbs, etc. Def Labcab n all the other big rap groups at the time were putting out 10/10 albums for me, like Blowout Comb."
"Meanwhile people are putting Bo Jackson above him lol

Much less Deion. He was much more marketable but not half the player."

Graduated 15k in debt. 

Found a job that doubled my salarie.

"I'm not sure you can use the word ""real"" when describing such a trip."
"As far as I remember Forza motorsport 4 is where that ended, after that they started coming out with horizon and it all went to shit. I think the reasoning was that it was getting too expensive to license every cool car every and open world games were the new hot ticket so it all shifted that way and imo for the worse. I got Forza Horizon, barely played it and hated it, returned and never came back to Forza. It's too bad because the racing wheel support and force feedback for FM3 was cutting edge for consoles at the time and I really hoped they were going to keep pushing that direction."

"Congratulations, you win."
MBDTF portrays that type of chaotic and contradictory life while still being cohesive. TLOP needed about three more weeks of work and it would have been really good.
"Also, when you’re done discussing that, what is the best religion? :)"
"PdM Oajan, PdM Layton, Aventus, Spice and Wood and Oud Wood."
I really like playing piano. That feeling you get after you finally nail a part is amazing.

Givenchy is such a great song but that cringey Birdman intro is the worst
Major International competitions is the main determinate in the rankings so because they flopped in the world cup they dropped and qualifiers and the nation's League isn't enough to take them back uo
"Powercolor red devil 5700xt owner here. I've had ZERO driver issues since they fixed them a couple months ago. I don't have a single complaint. 

If you don't want rtx or nvidias NVENC encoder for streaming, i would definitely go 5700xt"
The birthing is still in my mind

"Man, I feel for you. I can get boxes of 10 for $15 at pretty much any place in my town.

Edit: I usually have a supply in my fridge. I really like them too."
"Hi /u/legos45, thanks for your work with these posts.

I think right now, I'm torn between the Acer Aspire 5 and the ASUS Zenbook 13.

&#x200B;

Aside from the larger SSD and better battery life, are there any other reasons you can pinpoint that might make the ASUS worth the extra $200? I'm so close to pulling the trigger and trying to justify it to myself lol"
"Crunchyroll has a number of great shows that are free to stream. If you already have Netflix or Amazon Prime those services will give you access to some excellent shows as well.

Some suggestions if you are enjoying Bleach are

- My Hero Academia 
- Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood
- Gurren Lagann
- Hunter x Hunter(2011)
- Madoka Magica (watch at least thru episode 3)
- One Punch Man
- Mob Psycho 100
- Cowboy Bebop
- Trigun 
- Yuu-Yuu Hakusho (similar in theme to Bleach) 
- Soul Eater( also shares some similarly with Bleach) 
- Kill La Kill 

Descriptions of all these shows can be found on Myanimelist.net 

Additionally if you haven't seen it yet, I would also take a look at Avatar the Last Airbender. There is some controversy whether it should be considered an anime, but ignoring that the show is one of the absolute best shows ever produced."
