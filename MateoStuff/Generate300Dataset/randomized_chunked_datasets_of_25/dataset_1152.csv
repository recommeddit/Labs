5766,best programming language for web development,"Typically user experience (UX) for larger companies. However, I've noticed that for smaller projects they normally expect their web developers to be able to roll a design out themselves without UX."
3101,best webcamera,My S10e is better than any webcam. That is not a $1000 phone.
43493,best items under $100,You need a nice water bottle and a good size pee jar for your nightstand. Try not to confuse them.
3095,best webcamera,"At least on Teams, you can join a meeting on your phone and on the computer at the same time; your phone's selfie cam will do a better job than any webcam."
20453,best workout music,"""Summon the Worms"" from Brian Tyler's Children of Dune Soundtrack (there actually quite a few decent tracks but this one just gets me going)

36819,best roller coaster at six flags,What about the Superman?
69017,best science fiction novel,"I'm a series guy so this will have to reflect that.

(1) **Dune Series** by Frank Herbert. (Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune)

(2) **Hyperion Cantos** by Dan Simmons. (Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Rise of Endymion, Endymion)

(3) **The Sun Eater** by Christopher Ruocchio. HOPEFULLY, he will stick the landing. 3 out of 5 books are out and I am 75% done w/ the third. But they are... amazing. (Empire of Silence, Howling Dark, Demon in White).

If Sun Eater trips at the finish line, then I would replace it with the **Revelation Space** **Saga** by Alastair Reynolds. (Including the short stories of Galactic North, and the novels Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap. While The Prefect, Elysium Fire and Chasm City are top shelf material - the core series is unsurpassed in hard sci-fi.)"
70367,best major to study in college,Im a chem major and I love it! Although if I wasn’t super shy I would’ve loved to start a YouTube channel a few years ago. I think it just would’ve been a fun thing to do and making some extra money from it (if possible) would’ve been a nice plus
19242,best YouTube video,"Even the little things about this are funny, no idea if they're improvised or what but like the way the one guy says ""roof"" is funny, when they run away and the one guy tries to close the fence gate and can't so he boots it and runs is gold, the way they talk about the baby video ""I'm not comfortable about this"", ""that's his mom I know her, she still looks good"", and even the way they double check his face against the video is hilarious physical comedy. 

They really deserve a lot of credit for nailing a lot of things with this, glad a couple of then have careers in the industry."
2525,best headphones,"This question pops up frequently and I hope people look into these

The KOSS PORTA PRO is my absolute pick. I also listen to a LOT of what I call ""sweet spot"" music and these always come through (the subtle parts of production are too often lost) not with the Koss. There is no noise cancelling and though they are over ear there is ambient sounds coming through but they never disappoint. 

As I've said in other forums I have bought over 20 pair of these over the years and gifted them to friends with many big smiles. They used to have lifetime guaranty but I'm not sure what current policy is (I have sent damaged ones in with $5.00 and had them returned like new. About $40.00 online(amazon)? or where you can find the. Great for travel cause they fold nicely.  Do your ears a favor, they will surprise you."

10267,best suitcase lock,I also do this when it's available.
49063,best gaming monitor,"I have to agree with you on the poor implementation of the OSD software (which would honestly be a great thing if it worked as intended), but I really do like the design of the stand. It takes up very little room on the desk, it's more adjustable than any other monitor I've owned, and it feels very sturdy. What exactly do you mean ""ergonomically bad""?"
39117,best web browser,"new Edge is quite amazing tbh, any chrome extension works on it too"
44776,best items under $100,Electric toothbrush. My teeth are WAY cleaner than they ever were and my dentist noticed.

17936,best Kardashian,Oh yea I totally see that.
31580,best hotel to live in,"Hard call.  In my 20s I worked at a non profit trade association, that put on one of the worlds largest trade shows.  The association would be comp’ed rooms, which they could give to employees to stay in during the show (since we pulled crazy hours).

Long story, since I was young, hard working and had no political agenda, I got along with everyone.  And as such started to get nicer & nicer rooms.  My last year there I had a two story suite at the Swissotel in Chicago.   It was twice the size of the apartment I shared with two roommates.  It was probably the fanciest/most expensive.  

But my favorite was the overwater bungalow I had on my honeymoon at the Hilton Moorea, in French Polynesia.  Still one of my favorite life experiences."
30230,best Mexican war to study,"""Remember the Alamo"" was about all we got in school when I was a kid."
68681,best science fiction novel,"The second book is very different, and much better, even though I really liked the first one."
47251,best state to visit in the United States,"Bring your drinking shoes. Also eat all the food. It’s one of, and arguably the best food cities in America."
38729,best newspapers to read,Most would argue that the Guardian is extremely left?
13601,best research paper archive,"I might just be living in my own bubble here, but surely this is University studying 101 and not an LPT? I thought everyone who studied at university would know this pretty much within the first week or so."
