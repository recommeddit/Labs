69017,"I'm a series guy so this will have to reflect that.

(1) **Dune Series** by Frank Herbert. (Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune)

(2) **Hyperion Cantos** by Dan Simmons. (Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Rise of Endymion, Endymion)

(3) **The Sun Eater** by Christopher Ruocchio. HOPEFULLY, he will stick the landing. 3 out of 5 books are out and I am 75% done w/ the third. But they are... amazing. (Empire of Silence, Howling Dark, Demon in White).

If Sun Eater trips at the finish line, then I would replace it with the **Revelation Space** **Saga** by Alastair Reynolds. (Including the short stories of Galactic North, and the novels Revelation Space, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap. While The Prefect, Elysium Fire and Chasm City are top shelf material - the core series is unsurpassed in hard sci-fi.)",best science fiction novel

19242,"Even the little things about this are funny, no idea if they're improvised or what but like the way the one guy says ""roof"" is funny, when they run away and the one guy tries to close the fence gate and can't so he boots it and runs is gold, the way they talk about the baby video ""I'm not comfortable about this"", ""that's his mom I know her, she still looks good"", and even the way they double check his face against the video is hilarious physical comedy.

2525,"This question pops up frequently and I hope people look into these

The KOSS PORTA PRO is my absolute pick. I also listen to a LOT of what I call ""sweet spot"" music and these always come through (the subtle parts of production are too often lost) not with the Koss. There is no noise cancelling and though they are over ear there is ambient sounds coming through but they never disappoint. 

As I've said in other forums I have bought over 20 pair of these over the years and gifted them to friends with many big smiles. They used to have lifetime guaranty but I'm not sure what current policy is (I have sent damaged ones in with $5.00 and had them returned like new. About $40.00 online(amazon)? or where you can find the. Great for travel cause they fold nicely.  Do your ears a favor, they will surprise you.",best headphones

31580,"Hard call.  In my 20s I worked at a non profit trade association, that put on one of the worlds largest trade shows.  The association would be comp’ed rooms, which they could give to employees to stay in during the show (since we pulled crazy hours).

Long story, since I was young, hard working and had no political agenda, I got along with everyone.  And as such started to get nicer & nicer rooms.  My last year there I had a two story suite at the Swissotel in Chicago.   It was twice the size of the apartment I shared with two roommates.  It was probably the fanciest/most expensive.  

But my favorite was the overwater bungalow I had on my honeymoon at the Hilton Moorea, in French Polynesia.  Still one of my favorite life experiences.",best hotel to live in
