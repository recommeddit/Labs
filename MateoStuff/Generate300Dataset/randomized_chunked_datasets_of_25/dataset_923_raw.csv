No it isn't worth the extra $70 imho.
maybe you should stop putting in hand grenades in your checked luggage to stop having them stolen
"Yeah...if our hands our dirty, it's not just germs but also particles or dirt that are on our hands. Using hand sanitizer may kill germs but it still leaves dirt and residue. Ewww."
"I find Loweâ€™s (at least near me) has better finish items, while HD has more rough-in stuff. 

Itâ€™s also about the staff. At Loweâ€™s where I used to live, getting competent help was hard, at HD I was beating them off with a stick. 

Now that Iâ€™ve moved; The closest Loweâ€™s is 45 min away. Closest HD is 20."
Got to love a film with an ironic name :-)

"Huh, maybe Iâ€™ll use my pizza stone tonight, thanks for the tip"
I just setup a raspberry pi + xbmc for my dad this weekend. Him and my mom love it.
I fucking love Ruby. Ecstatic to be able to use it full time.
Will I still be prepared for emergency celebrations and making other people look fabulous?
"I'm surprised you listed Better Call Saul but not Breaking Bad... did you not like it, or have you not seen it? If you haven't seen it, then... BREAKING BAD! 

Only 4 seasons, but Mr. Robot is fucking fantastic (not on Netflix unfortunately, but I really recommend trying to watch it). Hannibal is also great, but there are only 3 seasons. 

Bates Motel is so good and creepy, but it might be a bit campy for you. 

If you want an endless supply of true crime, Forensic Files is the way to go. Like a million episodes, but they're very formulaic."
LOR? What is the full name?
Exactly what I wanted to hear! Thanks! Iâ€™ll try to get it this weekend.
"Cotton candy, no doubts."
"Literally the same list of television on Netflix that Iâ€™ve gone through. Moved on to Fresh Meat because I liked Bad Education and the Inbetweeners. Second episode in - so far, I can highly recommend."

Cato was overly conservative and probably lead to Caesar's Civil War.  Cicero was the real hero in the whole thing.  Political moderate and orator extraordinaire that tried to save the Republic.  A pragmatist and enemy of Mark Antony.
"Well again, it was this big concert in 2012 (got that corrected).  There were a bunch of big name acts that all performed for like 20 minutes a piece on a big rotating stage.  Crew would be prepping one side of the stage while one act is performing and then the stage would rotate around for the next act so that there was only like 3 minutes of turn around.  Each artist also came to our press area to run a gauntlet of quick interviews and then do a meet and greet with a few fans who won radio station contests.

So obviously the schedule was extremely tight and precise.  Again, there were quite a few very popular acts including Justin Beiber, and everyone was on point, right on schedule, except for Avril who apparently thought she was a big enough star that she refused to come out of her bus, fucked up the performance schedule and cancelled her meet and greet.  She only did the interviews that she had to and everyone was basically told don't talk to her, don't look at her, anyone not essential leaves.  As opposed to Kelly who came early to individually say hi to all of our interns before doing her thing."
"Where I'm from, most people consider them a problem because they'll crush your water pipes to get to the water. A lot of houses in my old neighborhood got rid of them because they were doing too much damage to their pipes."
"Lmao, no hope at all huh. Ok if I wanted to go to grad school does that change anything at all? I seriously suck dick at math and all sciences but bio and environmental"
Does your GSP 370 disconnect like the others? I want to buy one but that DC bug is a deal breaker for me
You named some pretty good ones man.  I got nothing.

Thank you for the time to answer me. The Xf270hua seems like the most reasonable option
