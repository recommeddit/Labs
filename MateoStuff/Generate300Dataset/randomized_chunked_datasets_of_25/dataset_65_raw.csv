"Yeah I am glad you mentioned that. DXM is only going to get you high at *much* higher than recommended doses.

I'm not telling you to do it or not, but if you insist on doing it, make sure that Dextromethorphan is the ONLY active ingredient. Other ingredients at those doses can severely injure you, or even kill you outright. 

Also, if you plan on doing ridiculous amounts of DXM, I recommend a trip sitter, someone who will step in if things start going haywire. I've never done it, but I know those who have."
Lots of people got tonnes on their plates and still manage to knock features out of the park. I get what you're saying. I hope that's the case and he isn't just being lazy. I don't like to hate on people unnecessarily.

"As a pianist I may be biased, but I’d say any keyboard instruments are the easiest to learn as they have all notes displayed in a methodical and visually simple way. That said, mastering any instrument is a completely different matter!"
Architecture is one of the most strenuous majors and also has the lowest post-graduate employment.

Catan isn’t even on this list :(
"Graphic Design:

The market is over saturated with designers. 

Design is very subjective. No matter what jargon pro designers may throw at you about color theory and the golden ratio, when it comes down to you finding a job, it's all about if the employer likes what they see.  

The current industry is being devalued by sites like fiverr and 99designs where companies will pay pennies to get a logo or a flyer made. This make companies not value or need in house designers. 

Design agencies are very stuck up and the culture is almost always cut throat. 

The pay sucks. Depending on your city the entry level pay can fluctuate, but you will be making nowhere near the money you could be with other forms of education. 

You most likely will not be doing what you love unless you get lucky. If you become an in-house designer be prepared to only design stuff related to whatever your company specializes in for the rest of your employment there. If you're hired at an agency, you will have more opportunities to work on different brands, but may not be the brands you're interested in."
Just get it online lol. I wanted the apple Leather but they said it wouldn’t be in the store til November lmao. So I bought it online and it’ll be here Thursday

"Brady’s individual passing records will probably be beaten when it’s all said and done, jerry rice’s will probably never be topped. Larry fitz is as close as we’ve come and he’s still far behind rices records."

"Studied biomedical engineering and wish I'd done pretty much anything else. Had to work hard as f only to realize I pigeon holed myself to one industry, and that industry prefers to hire mechanical engineers anyways"
"Honestly in a lot of classes, it’s bundled in with the lead up to the civil war.   It highlights a lot of the higher ups on both sides fighting together once upon a time.   

We get a little about the Alamo mainly to mention Davey Crockett.   

 But mainly it is discussed in how the new states would add tension to the boiling issue of slavery and how those new states would be added."
"I like to look at hotels TripAdvisor sites as they usually have user photos. Not the elaborately staged bedroom photos. It's a good way to get your mind around the location from the every day eye.

Also talk to a rep with a holiday firm. Most have travelled more than the average Joe. And will have good recommendations. 
Local word of mouth is my favourite.  Best food and nights out I have had is following a locals advice. .. goodles luck"

Read the reviews on Amazon and saw a lot of leaking. What say you?
">!Throughout the movie, Amy Adams's character remembers her daughter who died of cancer. At the end it's revealed that she was not remembering the past, but actually foreseeing her future daughter that she will have with Jeremy Renner's character. They get together at the end and have a baby, even though she knows the daughter will die of cancer at a young age.!<"
"I must agree about the Three Body Problem. It was the driest, monotonous SF I've ever read. But that's just like...my opinion, man."
I'd recommend the Black Swan by Tassib. Interesting read on overconfidence in mathematical models and underestimating uncertainty built in.
