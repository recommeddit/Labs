24589,best anime,"1.  Log Horizon - I've spent a lot of time playing Runescape during my teen years, and I really liked how this series approached the ""stuck in a game"" theme. Shiroe was relatable to me (even to the point of being in a similar college program before he was trapped in the game), and I enjoyed the politics and strategizing rather than the action or harem sort of elements common to the genre.
2. Wagnaria!!  (Specifically S3, but the series overall really). - Funny, relatable, and despite the ""Inami punches Souta"" gag getting old during the first season, it definitely improved for the second and third and finally getting closure on most of the couples in the final season was so satisfying.
3. Re:CREATORS - The Reverse Isekai was an interesting concept and I enjoyed the ride the entire way even though the ending was a little bit of an ass-pull imo.
4. Aria the Animation - I would have put Yuru Camp here, but I haven't finished watching it. Max comfy, relaxing show to help unwind after a busy work day. Also the OP/ED are SO GOOD
5. Urara Meirochou - Kon best girl, fite me.

Honorable mentions: 91 Days, Fate/Zero, Shirobako - All definitely worth the watch"

9505,best toothpaste,"Some joker replaced my enamel with bullshit so I use Gel-Kam every other night after regular brushing and flossing.

It tastes like insanity and it costs $16 per tube but I've only had one cavity since. It has several x the amount of fluoride than normal."
1641,best ice cream flavor,Oh lord that sounds good
46535,best trick or treating candy,Right? I’m from VT and I guess this explains why I don’t care for Halloween. I’d rather get apples and quarters instead of that Tootsie Pop shit.
5053,best home improvement store,Our HD wanted to call and verify veterans. They would only give discounts to retired and 100 disabled veterans. That’s none of their business. Our HD is crappy.
32667,best vacation resort,"If you can get to Thailand, I'd recommend it over just about anything else. The whole country is basically centered around the tourism industry and so will do anything to make your time there enjoyable. My girlfriend and I stayed on  [Koh Samui](http://thailandbucksandhens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/13562520912.jpg)  and would go back in a heartbeat."
40264,best midrange CPU,IMO you should wait until the release of Zen 4 before getting anything high-end because DDR5 and the fact that PCI Gen 4 will be more mainstream by then. You could do what I plan to do and build a decent PC that can hold up until then.
61713,Best RPG game on PS4,AC Odyssey and Origins. Horizon. Sleeping Dogs. God of War.
1328,best ice cream flavor,It actually is now coffee toffee... they got into it with the heath people apparently.
44657,best items under $100,Oh my God I even use Clinique.  Now that's creepy. I'm considering switching to rivasol moisturizer tho so... Are you?

69964,best major to study in college,"> labs are super fun IMO

This attitude is probably the #1 reason why someone does or doesn't make it in the field. I graduated with a bachelors in Physics, loved my study, but would never make it as a physicist because I am not particularly happy in the lab setting (though my experience was limited). For anyone thinking of studying physics, I encourage you to start labwork as soon as possible to find out how you like it, and try projects in different disciplines if it's feasible at your school.

> physicists are a bunch of wonderful, interesting people.

I would second this. My major was small (class of 10-15 at a school of 5500 students) and I am still close friends with many of my physics classmates 4 years after graduating."
36170,best alcoholic drink,"Dirty girl scout!

We would put the chocolate syrup on tongue first, the take peppermint schnapps."
17125,best iOS game,"Sorry, I haven't played it. Probably it's more of the same with a few additions, which can't be bad right?"
59761,best perfume,"Possibly selection biases. But I’ve seen quite a few women reviewers basically say they gravitate over time to masculine fragrances because they’re more varied, rich, and creative. 

Now I don’t know if that’s true because I haven’t smelled much womens at all but I have heard it."
46641,best trick or treating candy,no fucking way it's Mars in Ohio. I haven't seen a Mars bar here in my entire fucking life

6988,best iPhone,"This has nothing to do with his post.

But yes, all X models had this issue. It's only there when you actually bother to notice it though. OCD always fucks me on things like that too, so I know exactly why this irritates you.

What hurts even more is that my OnePlus 7 Pro cost £300 less, but has the first OLED screen I've seen thats close to perfect as I'll ever get when it comes to evenness.... BUT I had to go through 3 devices, all for various faults, to get this.

Apple devices have never been known for consistent screen quality though."
68574,best science fiction novel,you bring shame upon us all scifi_jon.  You know what [you must do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku).  Be swift.
42527,best detective show,"Agreed, so excited for Dune."
14488,best romantic novel,I just read Beach Read last week because of you and was absolutely NOT disappointed. Thanks :)
36516,best alcoholic drink,"Yes, it absolutely works but you have to be consistent. Alcohol-wise, beer is the main enemy when trying to lose weight to any effect. You just can't drink it. Wine is a bit better but not much. I stick to the hard liquor and try to limit myself to one or two drinks. I don't know how comfortable I feel telling an alcoholic to stick to the hard liquor but if you can contain yourself, that's what works for me, as far as weight loss goes."
63294,best package manager ios 14 jailbreak reddit,They deleted it to fix some issues then they will add it back .
