30580,"Just to chime in here, the interest of the US reached beyond greed.  I highly suggest you check out A Bodyguard of Lies by Anthony Brown; Brown suggests that FDR actually ""warmongered"" the US into a position suitable for intervention in Europe.  These warmongering actions include rousing anti-German sentiments, quietly of course, pushing US trading vessels into german uboat zones, provoking Japan (offering outlandish peace settlements, oil embargo), and not acting on the tip that Japan was planning to attack Pearl Harbor.  This claim is supported by founded evidence we have on FDR's strong anti-isolationist sentiments, strong pro-British sentiments, and his anti-nazi stance.",best Mexican war to study

24591,"1. Berserk-
This got me into anime and helped develop a taste for good story telling. In particular the parallels of Guts wondering what to do in life and who he is is something I can relate to.

2. Monogatari series-
This series can be confusing but it explains things pretty well at the end of each arc. I always enjoyed that the Mc learned what was going on when I did.

3. Highschool DxD-
I don't need a reason.

4. Oregairu-
Like alot of people I can relate to the Mc but I wouldn't go to the lengths he does to help people.

5. One Piece-
I feel like most of my love for one piece died 300 eps ago but those first 500 were some of my favorite parts of anime.",best anime

9145,"I've read that baking soda promotes healing, and I've tried it myself to positive results.  Usually I just dump some baking soda right on there, maybe mixed with some water.  Pretty painful, but it makes the canker sore go away after a day or two.  I guess the question is whether the preventative/healing benefits of having baking soda in the toothpaste outweighs the harm of the sodium lauryl sulfate.",best toothpaste

5869,"First quickly learn and understand the difference between ""back\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""server\-side""\) and ""front\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""client\-side""\) web development. Next learn HTML and CSS, which are essential to learn first since they are necessary for the ""front\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""client\-side""\) on all websites no matter what. Next move on either to advanced ""front\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""client\-side""\) by learning Javascript, or move on to ""back\-end"" \(a.k.a. ""server\-side""\) by learning a popular server\-side web language like PHP, C# DotNet, Server\-Side Node.js, Ruby, etc. Finally once you know the basics of front\-end and back\-end development languages you could learn about popular libraries, frameworks and CMS software built on top of the languages you know, but its best to understand the fundamentals first before learning extra layers of abstractions built on top.",best programming language for web development
