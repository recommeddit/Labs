48087,best color to paint with,"Colour meanings are entirely subjective. They change from person to person and culture to culture. 

If you're going to advise on colour get into proper colour theory and look at *actual* scientific results.

The only reputable scientific study I have found on the physical effects of colour are recorded by Johannes Itten:

[""Experiments have demonstrated a difference of five to seven degrees in the subjective feeling of heart or cold between a workroom painted in blue-green and one painted in red-orange. That is, in the blue-green room the occupants felt that 59° F was cold, whereas in the red-orange room they did not feel cold until the temperature fell to 52 - 54° F. Objectively, this meant blue-green slows down the circulation and red-orange stimulates it.    
Similar results were obtained in an animal experiment. A racing stable was divided into two sections, the one pointed blue, the other red-orange. ln the blue section, horses soon quieted down after running, but in the red section they remained hot and restless for some time. It was found that there was no flies in the blue section, and a great many in the red section.""](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ofvRhNBgoCoC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=itten+color+blue+green+temperature+room&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XI1YrTdQR2&amp;sig=6tOqnguCqc-136-DeYQxKGdpZi4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vYFUUrfJJumhigfXi4CIAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=itten%20color%20blue%20green%20temperature%20room&amp;f=false)

Knowledge of these 'physical' effects can help us to design much more effectively, at a universal level. Essentially, if you want to energise people, use red-orange, if you want to calm people, use blue-green.

It is these kinds of studies that should be of greatest interest to us, as they appear to transcend cultural boundaries.

The other day I was at a friend's house and it was quite cold. He put on his new Apple TV and put a fireplace screen saver on it with a roaring fire burning away. Even though the room temperature had not increased, we all felt warmer because of the fire. The red-orange colouring of the fire had a physical effect on us as we sat there.

If you want to learn more about colour, start by reading [The Elements of Color  By Johannes Itten](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ofvRhNBgoCoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Elements+of+Color++By+Johannes+Itten,+Faber+Birren&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMInYOw45DGyAIVBBqmCh2p7w1k#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Elements%20of%20Color%20%20By%20Johannes%20Itten%2C%20Faber%20Birren&amp;f=false) (excerpt taken from this book above)"

71539,best movies with a cool twist,"He never thought of Lilly or Lupin as inferiors, but werewolves were *definitely* looked down on in that society. In the later books Lupin had a hard time even finding employment because of it. Lilly was muggle-born and again, while Sirius didn't look down on her for it, his family sure would have. He was a pureblood and therefore had a higher status among many in the wizarding world. 

Sirius could easily have decided that they were beneath him, and he certainly grew up with parents who would have told them they were. While we don't know much about his time at Hogwarts he clearly decided to be friends with them anyway. He probably had to battle the prejudices his family tried to ingrain into him. So when he tells Harry ""*If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors...*"" he's coming from a place where he himself learned to treat people that society says are inferior with respect. 

Sirius is an interesting mixture of egalitarian and judgemental. He's judgemental and mean to Kreacher, to my knowledge never stood up to James for his treatment of Snape when they were at Hogwarts (and they remained pretty rude to each other through the books), and he hated his brother and likely never suspected that Regulus would steal and attempt to destroy one of Voldemort's horcuxes. Yet he's perfectly willing to accept werewolves, muggle-borns, and others as equals."
