13717,"Well, not really. If I recall correctly (it's been a while since I read the book) Schrodinger is really talking about statistical mechanics which, despite having the word statistics in the title, is not really related to the statistics dearsomething is talking about. The statistics dearsomething is talking about is more the statistical testing of hypothesis (p-values and null hypothesis and whatnot) which appears absolutely no where in statistical mechanics. Heck even statistical mechanics makes very little use of the field of statistics. As Wikipedia suggests, it would be better called probability mechanics since it uses more ideas from that but, even then, it is rather limited. Also, keep in mind his book was was written 70 years ago when interpretations were very different and nowadays most physicists understand the probabilistic nature of the universe. However that's a debate for another day for the subtleties involved.

This type of statistics more refers experimentalists going into the lab and doing statistical analysis on data to confirm or deny a hypothesis. Unfortunately my knowledge of this is about just above zero since it was briefly discussed when I took my horrible statistics classes (why is statistics always taught so poorly? This seems to be universal, much to my dismay!)",best research paper archive
