70513,best major to study in college,"They don't, but they have to authorize transferring to different majors outside of the college. I was originally an engineering major going into math, but she practically forced me to stay in the information and engineering college under a CS major"
10729,best suitcase lock,"Curious.  Does your test piece silent alarm, or alarm and alert the thief as well? Couldn't the suspect claim they ""accidentally"" opened the mail\package, or the package was already open\loose, and got rustled?"

58965,best perfume,"I really need to revisit Grand Soir. I remember preferring the other MFKs to it, but I think it's one that may really need more time to grow. It has such a lovely name, too."
36812,best alcoholic drink,Espresso martini. It's my fave but I can't sleep if I drink lots of them. I like most cocktails to be fair.
8443,best toothpaste,"I mean this is pretty overkill for anyone without high caries risk. Your standard 1000 ish ppm supermarket toothpaste is going to be fine for most people. Its more how you brush that determines if you are more likely to get decay or not. For most, the 5000ppm toothpaste is just a waste of money."
52304,best hiphop album,Tbh. No one. East coast had it locked

8909,best toothpaste,">So why would this be different when combined with a toothpaste?

Enamel is pretty hard, it is possible that something less hard than tooth enamel is used as an abrasive in certain applications. That being said, it looks as though the consensus is that baking soda is abrasive to tooth enamel."
13717,best research paper archive,"Well, not really. If I recall correctly (it's been a while since I read the book) Schrodinger is really talking about statistical mechanics which, despite having the word statistics in the title, is not really related to the statistics dearsomething is talking about. The statistics dearsomething is talking about is more the statistical testing of hypothesis (p-values and null hypothesis and whatnot) which appears absolutely no where in statistical mechanics. Heck even statistical mechanics makes very little use of the field of statistics. As Wikipedia suggests, it would be better called probability mechanics since it uses more ideas from that but, even then, it is rather limited. Also, keep in mind his book was was written 70 years ago when interpretations were very different and nowadays most physicists understand the probabilistic nature of the universe. However that's a debate for another day for the subtleties involved.

This type of statistics more refers experimentalists going into the lab and doing statistical analysis on data to confirm or deny a hypothesis. Unfortunately my knowledge of this is about just above zero since it was briefly discussed when I took my horrible statistics classes (why is statistics always taught so poorly? This seems to be universal, much to my dismay!)"
19521,best YouTube video,Sam O'nella Academy
58003,best cologne,Thanks for the advice (this whole thread is great) but Sausage has some of the most absurdly cringe marketing I’ve ever seen. Depp dressed up like he’s 23 riding a motorbike around the desert with 38 silver bangles when in actual fact he’s 53 or whatever. God I find it so ridiculous.
