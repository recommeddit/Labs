31876,"Most hotels will have a monthly rate they don't advertise. You usually won't see this on websites, so it's better to call in advance (if you can), or if you're really ballsy, just find a hotel upon arrival, walk in, and ask if they have a monthly rate.

Maybe it's less common with high-end luxury hotels, but places that are more low to mid range (and seldom fully booked) will usually be pretty happy to cut you a small discount for the extra business.

As an example, one of the places I stayed at in central Vietnam was $10 a night for a very nice double room with an en-suite bathroom. Their discount was 2 free nights for every 10 days booked, so I was able to get a ~$300/mo room for $240.",best hotel to live in

24145,"I actually said grills myself, it is just some dumb meme, but anyway yeah it is a generalization but all I really have to go off is my sister and mom, who are both old and set in their ways.

26234,"I'm a millennial but I love president Clinton. I hate that the further left in the party have tarnished him name a bit especially this last cycle. The reforms he got through weren't perfect but were great first steps for gay rights, he was a centrist who tried working with both sides while one side absolutely hated him but he still got a lot accomplished. It's easy to look back and critic or say it wasn't enough but I think considering the climate he did a pretty good job and built a strong coalition for the party to succeed for quite a while.",best politician
