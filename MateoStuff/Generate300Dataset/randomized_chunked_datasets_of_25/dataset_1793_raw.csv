"Nah, speaking as a senior accounting student, it's just addition/subtraction, basic algebra stuff. The harder part of accounting is remembering all the rules and exceptions."
Did you know they have a sign for that in ASL?
"I use Adaway for global, and lucky patcher for app specific. As a result j never have to deal with ads. YouTube is a different ballpark, for that I have to flash YouTube Vanced."
"I would say that you probably need to learn the ups and downs of a ""Rolling Release"" and a monolithic release.

Determine whether you would rather deal with *essentially* a reinstall every development cycle and do patches or whether you would rather keep to a rolling release where you do your own rollouts when you feel the installed tree is stable.  

Find out from IT if anyone has strong knowledge of any distro -- thats going to be a big help post install.  Every distro is ever so different (usually in insidious ways) and having even just one local person with good knowledge can save a lot of time and hassle."
Arrowhead is the worst hands down
"Rice started with Bill Walsh, and it's not like George Seifert was some chump. I think Seifert should be in the hall tbh"
"I do not like at all where Microsoft is heading and the whole thing about bloatware , privacy etc. I will stay with Windows 10 until supports end on my PC and then upgrade to Win11 just for playing games and for heavy gpu/cpu based software. I am planning on using Linux most of my time."

*I'm from Virginia where aint shit to do but cook*
"I'm in the last few pages and man what a ride has this been. Loved his chapter on the famous Garry Kadparov vs Deep Blue matches in particular. Also, I think his challenges to mainstream economics are very well articulated. I think everyone should read this book."
Exactly why I love this sub
"I would choose Madvillainy, Liquid Swords or My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy."
10 bucks boobs only and 20 fully nude where I'm from.
Films bragging about the length of standing ovation time is a new level of “I’ll never watch this move out of spite” hate
"KD pulls in 1.5 million+ visitors every year, I wouldn’t call that low"
I have never worried about the tiny amount of toothpaste left in the tube when I throw it out. Is this what rich people feel like all the time?
He’s so utterly terrified he can’t move

Special mentions to the Strugatsky brothers (Roadside Picnic, Monday starts on Saturday, Hard to be a God), James Morrow (This is the Way the World Ends) and Gene Wolfe (The Book of the New Sun). 

Edit: I've just realised so many books I didn't mention from Reynolds/Banks/Vinge that I'm getting all stroppy trying to narrow it down to 5."
"Maybe more of a mystery/puzzle than a crime series, but Dark is fantastic. Has some elements of what you listed here. Involves people going missing and there are detectives on the case."
