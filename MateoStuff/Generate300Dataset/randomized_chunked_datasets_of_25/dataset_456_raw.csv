"Wow, I had no idea! This is exciting, thank you for telling me!"
It was not. I spent too much money on that game (any money is too much money on that RNG filled waste of gigabytes!) and I wanted to make sure I never ever touched it again.

"Get Out. You had a bad feeling, but you convince yourself that it can't be. Then, when Rose reveals herself to be the ultimate villain and baited Chris to his death, we felt the disgust and betrayed. Then the second twist, when Chris sees the cop car and we think it's the police, only for it to be his friend--- the twist was great."
"That's what I do, too. Keep in mind that isopropanal is less effective against viruses than ethanol based sanitizer solutions, but more effective against bacteria and fungal spores."
You can buy ZMI (Xiaomi) USB-C cables off Amazon for less than 10 bucks for a pair.  There’s literally no reason to be buying unknown stuff.
"It would actually be a Kentucky buck...an Irish buck would be with Irish whiskey. Like with a Moscow mule, the Moscow indicates vodka. A Kentucky mule would be with bourbon. Buck and mule style cocktails are essentially cocktails that use ginger and usually lime, but a whiskey ginger would probably technically qualify as a buck style drink"
"People will argue about what backend language to learn, but if you're looking for employment you don't always have the luxury of choosing this.  You can't master every language, but you'd want at least a passing familiarity with any of these, and probably mastery of one:

- PHP
- Python (Django, flask)
- Ruby (Rails)
- Java
- NodeJS

These are the languages in which most websites & web apps are written.

"For South Dakota, I would make a argument for Rush Mountain adventure park. Sure, it's only coaster is a alpine coaster, but it has more attractions for the whole family, whereas storybook land is pretty much a themed children's playground that happens to have a few rides."
"Ah, that 's a really good deal for the price actually. Spending more for the HP Envy x360 13"" would be most ideal, but that's a great deal."
"It’s a PITA getting there. We’re in Australia, so we flew directly to Sri Lanka, had an airport sleepover (slept there for 8 hours) which I HIGHLY recommend. We flew to Male. Took a three hour sea plane AND a 45 minute boat transfer. So yes, it’s an absolute hike. You could of course pick a resort closer to Male and reduce that a bit. For that reason it’s not worth it unless you’re there for at least 5 nights so you can relax properly, we went for 7."
Seasons in the Abyss. The whole album is just long enough to get me through a morning workout.

"Ahh that makes sense.  I just got the tube and it says Sodium Monoflourophosphate.  I assume the flouro part of that is the flouride, right?"
