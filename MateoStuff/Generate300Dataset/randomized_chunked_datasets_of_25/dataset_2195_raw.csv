How dark does it look in real life?
"ON my 21st my friends made me do the ""gauntlet"" which was a shot of rumple minze, then a 3 wise men, 4 horsemen and finally a cement mixer. Had to be one right after the other. 10/10 would not recommend."
"I have a very fond memory from last summer where I woke up early, went down to my high schools track, and started one of my most kick ass runs with Rasputin by Boney M."
"This *was* two months ago, but...

In any case, people have different tastes, and I understand it. Now, ""realism"" isn't what I'm looking for in an anime, and I think most people would agree with me. My characters don't look real and do all sorts of things that no normal person would ever do. I like it when a series tries to be realistic on some aspect and achieves it successfully, but being realistic isn't a big merit on itself, IMO.

That said, I didn't like the pacing and I felt that romance overshadowed what I thought was the strongest element in the series (i.e. comedy).

I went too far by saying it's ""pretty bad"", in fact, I gave it a 7 (although I probably should've given it a 6). It's still worth watching, but unlike the first one, it didn't have me laughing all the time, and the romance and drama weren't good enough to take the place comedy had taken in the first one. Partly because some of the comic-relief is really mood-breaking."
RWRB is the best depiction of bisexuality in a romance novel that I’ve read.
"Rice, rice, rice, rice, rice, with a miso soup at the side.

Asian. :D"
I have some from Brook Linen and the quality is wonderful!
"anything interesting come out in Q2 or is this post still up to date? I'm looking for a lightweight laptop that I can take outside without having to worry about not being able to see the screen. I've found that the ones with a lower nit don't advertise the display brightness, so I would assume the ones that do are *decent* enough. I realistically just want to run VS/Code, and I prefer Windows so no M1 for me. I'm also trying to spend  < $1000"
Read your comment and couldn't agree more. Beats anything in it's price range and even some more expensive pairs. All around excellent set of cans.
"A lot of people I know who liked it at first got bored of it as well, or sick of the setup or just wanted to move onto something else.

I get the design is good but the story is pretty bland and generic and it's a fiddly beast that takes ages to set up and play. Just doesn't seem like it would have such wide appeal"
"Don't really use a desk lamp since...my monitors are bright as fuck, I have recessed lights in the ceiling and also a table lamp on a cabinet behind my desk. If anything, I'll get a floor lamp and put it off to the side of my desk..."
"Hi, I would go for one of the Gateway laptops on my list with 16 GB RAM, as they offer very solid specifications for cheap. The Gateway 15.6"" with a Ryzen 5 3450U is the value in my eyes."
"Took me three goes of anathem. There's a point in the book where everything clicks and then you (i) say 'that's my favourite book'.

I don't like any other neal stephenson but that's a masterpiece right there"
"I think viewpoints in this subreddit are somewhat skewed, as in my experience more people prefer island to desert. It's simpler, yes, but it still gives off a great ""skin of your teeth"" feeling almost every time you win"
Nah
I'm on tales of vesperia right now.
"And to think I went my whole life up until now thinking that men were some monolithic group with all of the exact same interests and desires.

This has really opened my eyes."
Can u have zebra cydia and installer alongside?
"Yes I agree. This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember'd;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day."
"Thanks! That's quicker and safer.

I clicked Cosmetic filtering off followed by uBO's Refresh button and got my icons back.

Going back the other way, I turned Cosmetic filtering back in and clicked uBO's Refresh button and the icons remained. I then hit F5 and they disappeared.

I don't mind this behavior. Please don't expend any resources on it. It's an action I probably only do once a month. It might even be an interaction with Webmail Ad Blocker which also helps to corral Yahoo's misbehavior."
i knew george bluth was a redditor..
great list
"Black Panther was WAY overhyped. Sure it’s great in many ways, but it doesn’t have much rewatchability and those other movies (except Doctor Strange maybe) are all better."
"The Wild Wild West

About a fascinating Indian godman/philosopher’s stay in the US amidst controversy."
