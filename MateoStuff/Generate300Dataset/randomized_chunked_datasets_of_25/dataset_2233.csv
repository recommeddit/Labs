16175,best sunglasses for fashion,"I'm a big fan of Oakley Holbrooks in matte black.  By no means are they ""dressy"" but I feel they are definitely a solid casual to semi-dress pair of shades.   Can be had for as low as $90 non-polarized."
61111,Best comedy show on Netflix,[The IT Crowd](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487831/)
25374,best spiderman actor,"Yeah, and here are some of the differences: slowed down the party girl-persona to make her more the girl-next-door-type (with is more Gwen's role), her being Peter's first love, all the flirtation and will-they-won't-they is dropped, Peter is from the beginning heel-over-head for her instead of realizing her qualities way later after  they're just friends, she's more of a alpha bitch, her tragic backstory is reduced to just fighting parents, her afrainess of getting married is not only slowed down but dropped to make her a run-away-bride in Spidey 2, the Peter-Spidey-MJ-love triangle is a nice nodd to the Richard-Donner-Superman-movies, but has nothing to do with the comics, etc."

32081,best hotel to live in,"[Ololo Lodge](https://www.olololodge.com/) in Nairobi, Kenya. It's located right at the edge of the national park and it's *incredible*. From the airport, I was driven through the park itself and saw almost everything on my bucket list *before even arriving*. I stayed in one of their ""tents"" for a few days, started safari with my amazing guide every morning before sunrise (who is so knowledgeable, it's insane... he could see things hundreds of yards away I never would have been able to by myself). At one point, we got stuck in mud surrounded by a pride of lions, and he got us out like a champ. The lodge itself is eco-friendly, grows most of its own food (chefs are FANTASTIC), and is staffed by incredibly kind people. At night, you hear the sounds of the savanna, and you can even watch wild animals (giraffes, monkeys, etc) while eating outside. I absolutely cannot stress how amazing this place is, and I can't wait to go back.

I also stayed in [Giraffe Manor](https://www.thesafaricollection.com/properties/giraffe-manor/) right after Ololo Lodge. It's the hotel you always see on Facebook where the giraffes eat breakfast with you, etc. It was a different type of experience (much more laid back, no safari, etc.), but also tops my hotel list. Breakfast and afternoon tea with giraffes, plus it's located on AFEW grounds (African Fund for Endangered Wildlife). You have to REALLY love giraffes though, as everything is geared around them. It's the most expensive hotel I've stayed in at over $1200 USD/night for one of the smaller rooms and I only got in because of a cancellation; otherwise, the hotel is booked out over a year in advance -- but you're not just paying for the room, it's the entire experience they offer. I plan on going back in 2021, staying with all four hotels under their brand."

360,best terminal file manager reddit,"1. Mostly terminal stuff for simple tasks. 
2. Thunar for more common drag & drop operations. 
3. Double Commander for more ""complex"" tasks."
40258,best midrange CPU,"For me I give 4 threads to each, so usually I have 12-16 available for the host system, Java's usually pretty quick to compile and the projects I work on aren't on the same order of complexity as firefox or chromium, so using that benchmark (Which he mentioned in his video) is basically irrelevant to what I do and the real world performance I'd see. Way out of touch for developer needs. I need ram more than I need cores. The machine before this one was dual 6 core Xeon and I didn't feel like I was lacking for cores on that one either."

13299,best spreadsheet editor,"I agree.  ""Best"" is so subjective too.  Best spreadsheet program for people that have used Excel their entire life?  Definitely Excel.  Switching would be a disaster for productivity.
