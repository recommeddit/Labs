Of course there is some green screen, but the vast majority of that movie was filmed. I think it's easy for people to forget how much work needs to go into making action of that caliber.

2347,"I have the Pandas, they sound great (not life changing or anything), but I wouldnt recommend them.  The firmware is buggy as hell, and they are prone to serious issues because of a cheap bluetooth reciever& shoddy batteries.  I've been through three already since November.  Their only saving grace is customer service will send you a new one at the drop of a hat. Tney are also extremely heavy and have practically no headband padding, which makes them extremely uncomfortable if you wear them for more than an hour.  Extra padding is hit or miss because nothing sticks to them (nuggets wont work) and the headband barely extends far enough to accomodate them anyway, so if you have a big head they won't extend far enough to fit.",best headphones

I've used this, for a client, and it looks fine. They suck because people dont know what 1080p means, or why they want it, and buy 720p or lower. I sell these kinds of things all the time, usually people just check out a Logitech and see the good ones for $100 and think that's what they need to spend for something good, but cheap out and buy some unmarked thing.
