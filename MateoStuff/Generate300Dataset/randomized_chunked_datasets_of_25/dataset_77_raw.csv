The Dark Tower series is excellent!  A very unique journey
Nano is flawless and efficient. Vim is powerful but has a learning curve. Sublime is user-friendly and colorful.
HD got rid of their veterans discount a few years ago. Did they bring it back recently?
"Correction, they don't use higher voltage, a cable is just a cable. They have crap controller chips and thin wires leading to what happened to you. The device that's connected to it chooses how much power is drawn. When the cable can't handle how much power is being drawn because the wires are too thin, the wires heat up and start melting things. For example: 2 amps through an Apple charging cable is fine, 2 amps through headphone sized wire would burn it to a crisp."
">	don’t really care to analyze someone’s post history

Perhaps you should. Then you realise that some people can never be fair, they can’t never acknowledge a positive thing. That for this guy he can only have one position on a certain topic. So his entire motivation to post and comment is to bring that up.

He’s creating a brand war every comment"
A lot of people have said the let’s go games. I scrolled through a let’s play if Pikachu and figured it looked different enough from go to give it a try. I’ll use it to get a feeling for the games then graduate to sword and shield or diamond and pearl
Death grips?
"Amy Lee of Evanescence was absolutely wonderful. Some friends and I waited after a concert for autographs, and prior to Amy emerging,  the bouncer-type-guy laid out in no uncertain terms that we weren't to try to touch her.

Well, one friend had had depression and Evanescence was one of the things that got her through her teen years. So she broke down in tears when Amy got to her in the autograph line, and Amy just went in and gave her this giant, comforting hug (hard to do since Amy is SO tiny). She was fabulous."
"Lavender rose ? Tell me more about it. 

Never had banana pudding, did you make it? Is it literally pudding in the ice cream? 

Is the licorne from your top 3 the black licorice?"
Haha and now I’m laughing again.
"Pierce Brosnan. Literally bumped into me at a coffee shop in Hawaii. Could not have been more gracious. 

I didn't recognize him until he sat down, and when I called my wife she begged me to go over and put him on the phone. 

Of course I didn't."

"Weekdays: I scramble 6 eggs with spinach, cook a pound of breakfast sausage, roll them up with cheese in tortillas and freeze them. One of those plus an apple or banana. Or if I've been lazy, a MetRX meal replacement bar.

Weekends: enchilada plate from a local drive-thru Mexican place, then a bottle of Pedialyte and a nap to combat the hangover."
"Poland is beautiful. Period.

"RIP me. I'll take it though, especially the half."
"Days Gone, it got some flak I don't think a lot of it is justified. The first 8 hours or so are a slog due to lack of skills and naff weapons but I think this makes a massive difference later as you realise just how bad even a small horde are. 

I've now started getting some decent weapons and skills and took down my first horde yesterday which felt awesome. 

I like the main character and the game is amazing graphically. The bike once you get some upgrades to it becomes really enjoyable to ride around on too."
"Didn’t quit. From my information, he learning a new animation style, and learning animations doesn’t happen overnight."
"As a Texan, I'm not really even sure what winter socks are.  I have ankle socks,  black socks, and brown socks.  That's about all I need."
“Nothing without the suit”
"Some of the newer coasters do not have landscape features, which I've come to notice (Scream, X2, Tatsu to an extent). Older rides (Gold Rusher, Revolution, Ninja) seem to be built around the landscape. I guess over time SFMM decided to go more for thrill than aesthetics, which I'm perfectly fine with since the newer coasters are pretty amazing. (As rickety as Revolution is, I do appreciate it's designed around landscape). 

As for Viper, it's only fun if you're taller than the headrests, otherwise you're going to have a bad time."

">You also seem to forget Shadow of the Colossus

I have it in the list as the remastered collection along with ICO.  But I appreciate that you are being thorough!

Silent Hill 2 Is indeed impossible to find for PC.  Not only that, it is extremely expensive if you do find it.  Silent Hill 3 has a far more reasonable price of about $25 on PC."
"As an alternative, if your headphones have an removable cable you can buy short one, or have one made for you new or mod your original one. Combine that with Qudelix 5K which is about half the weight(weighs around 25 grams if i recall correctly) and has better features than btr5, and you can clip it on the headband. Wont win you any fashion shows, but you get great sq from it, very functional and plenty alternative uses for the 5k."
"240hz 1080p Freesync or 144hz 1080 gsync.
Planning to use it with 1080/1080ti(if good deal comes outl/1170(if it is out < 3 months)"
Maybe the Model O Wireless? Idk but the BAMF sensor on that thing coupled with it's pretty light weight seems like a good pair for fps gaming.
