12792,best gifts for mom,"This is very moving.  Wish you the best of luck, and hope your kids appreciate you! =)"
41186,best instrument to play,Is a kazoo an instrument? It isn't on the list.
34906,best NFL player,"Hard to know for sure but one thing I've learned the last two seasons reviewing all submissions is you do get unexpected variance on players. We've talked about this too, from an on field perspective, Watson was phenomenal. So could be a little bit of reaction to what's happened but might not be as well."
14880,best romantic novel,"Honestly I still think about the first Clan of the Cave Bear all the damn time. It's the first and best, though Valley of the Horses is outrageously steamy and I love it for that. It also has the ""hookup with a person who doesn't speak your language"" trope which is...well, I love that stupid trope. 

The Mammoth Hunters turns into a damn soap opera but it's still fun. My mileage decreased drastically from there on in, and I DNF'd the last in the series, which apparently becomes a murder mystery at some point (!!!) but even so, I could not make myself continue."
56520,best desktop monitor,Oops I forgot to take that in account in my response. Since he has amd freesync would be good. Gsync does add cost.
42830,best detective show,The plot’s really interesting. I haven’t finished season 2 though but seems that interesting too.

why?"
21698,best winnie the pooh comic,"These are pretty hilarious.  They make him seem like such an asshole out of context.  If you read it in his voice, the way he would say it, it makes much more sense, though.

Whoever wrote these must normally write movies or shows.  It doesn't translate well as a comic at all."

32085,best hotel to live in,That always blows my mind because foreign tourists with butterflies on their ankles are VERY CLEARLY NOT YAKUZA.
16693,best pet for toddlers,"I have a rabbit. He's awesome, I love him, they're great for quiet, introverted, homebody adults.

Rabbits are terrible pets for small children. They're delicate, kick hard enough to break their own back, and are not cuddly. Rabbits hate being picked up, because they associate it with being carried off by a predator. Their body language is extremely subtle and completely alien for anyone who's used to dogs and cats. They're very independent and while they enjoy attention, they're not really a pet you actively play with; they prefer to be in the same general area as you and do their own thing. They're destructive and difficult to train (although they do litter box train easily). They require vet care from an exotics specialist, including spaying or neutering, which costs many times more than a regular vet and isn't available in all towns. A rabbit is just as much work as a dog, has a similar lifespan of 10-12 years, and can be even more expensive.

Please visit www.rabbit.org and r/rabbits to learn more about proper rabbit care. They can be rewarding companions, but are generally unsuitable in a home with a toddler."

I hope i'm doing it right...

So I went to the media tab in inspect element on google chrome in  saw .mp3 file so this is the file I open in a new tab? But before the .mp3 it has something like *filename*Ep5.mp3

The ep5 in the file name makes me think it means episode 5. It shows this ep5 on the file name on every audiobook i look at....

I just want be sure this is the correct thing to download"
45286,best gaming system,"Haha, yes I'm on my own at the moment. Just looking for a way to chill out on my own and relax after work. Would be good to play some game/s with a social element though.

I was looking at playstation, hadn't considered Gamepass... That might be a good idea.

Thank you for the info!"
